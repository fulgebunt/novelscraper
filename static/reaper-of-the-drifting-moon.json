But it felt like it was tied with chainsHis body didn\u2019t move like he wanted it to.\u00a0There was no strength in his hands and feet.His whole body felt helpless.The only thing that can move is his eyelids. He couldn\u2019t control the other parts of his body at all.\u00a0This did not go in.\u00a0(\uc774 \ub4e4\uc5b4\uac00\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\ub2e4.)\u2018There is nothing wrong with my eyes.\u2019He couldn\u2019t be sure because he couldn\u2019t even recognize his own limbs right away, but he instinctively realized that there\u2019s nothing wrong with his eyes.If he became blind, he would have felt something like pain. But there was no abnormality in his senses.Then it meant that there\u2019s nothing wrong with his eyes, but that the space in which he lay was unusually dark.\u00a0 A pitch-black location with no light coming in.\u2018Underground?\u2019He thought of the possibility.\u00a0He had never heard of a building built with human technology that can block out light so perfectly.If so, then there was a high probability that the space he was lying in was a basement or a perfectly closed space where light could not reach him.\u2018Why did this happen?\u2019He slowly traced his memory.Who was he?And why was he in this situation?His head throbbed as he tried to jog his memories.He couldn\u2019t think of anything, as if his brain had been struck.\u00a0It hurts.Tears were soon streaming from his eyes. It was as if someone had put a finger in his head and swung it around.He forcefully swallowed the scream.It was painful, but he didn\u2019t stop thinking. Then, little by little, his memory returned.\u2018My name is Pyo-wol. I am fourteen years old.\u2019A drifter who aimlessly wanders the world like an orphan without parents.\u00a0(\ubd80\ubaa8 \uc5c6\ub294 \uace0\uc544\uc5d0 \uc815\ucc98 \uc5c6\uc774 \ucc9c\ud558\ub97c \uc720\ub791\ud558\ub294 \ub5a0\ub3cc\uc774.)He has no roots, no dwelling place.\u00a0(\uadfc\ubcf8\ub3c4 \uc5c6\uace0, \uac70\ucc98\ub3c4 \uc5c6\ub2e4)He, Pyo-wol, furrowed his eyebrows in a frown.\u00a0Again, the pain rushed in like a tidal wave. Yet he forced himself to thinking. As a result, he was able to fully remember who he was.Now it\u2019s time to figure out why and how he ended up here.\u2018Him.\u2019Pyo-wol recalled the man who remained in his last memory. A middle-aged man whose characteristics was a plain face and sharp eyes that do not match.The man who he had stumbled upon in the midst of begging had said, \u201cYou look good enough.\u201dThat was the last memory of Pyo-wol.\u00a0At the end of those words, Pyo-wol lost his consciousness and woke up in the dark.The man in his memories must be related as to why he was left alone in such a space where no light enters.\u00a0Pyo-wol did not know the man\u2019s name nor identity.\u00a0He didn\u2019t even know why he was locked up like this.It couldn\u2019t be because of a grudge.\u00a0There was no way that he, an orphan who was just wandering aimlessly, would be the target of a resentment so deep that someone would do this.\u2018There must be some kind of purpose\u2014 a goal.\u2019If the captor\u2019s aim was to kill him, then they would have already killed him. They would not have gone through the trouble of locking him up without killing him. So they obviously must have some need or purpose for him.His head ached as if it would break.Trying to think deeply with his abnormal state had already consumed a great deal of mental power.\u00a0Pyo-wol closed his eyes.Whether he opened his eyes or closed it, there was no change. He wondered what it meant to close his eyes since his surroundings remained dark.Still, closing his eyes was less painful than keeping them open.He didn\u2019t know how much time had passed.Whether he had already lost his mind or was maintaining it, the boundaries were blurred.\u00a0(\uc815\uc2e0\uc744 \uc783\uc5c8\ub358 \uac83\uc778\uc9c0, \ud639\uc740 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc5c8\ub358 \uac83\uc778\uc9c0 \uacbd\uacc4\uac00 \ubaa8\ud638\ud588\ub2e4.)His head was a mess.Still, Pyo-wol struggled to find a clear spirit.After a while, his mind became clearer as if his efforts paid off.\u201cHu!\u201dPyo-wol was surprised with the involuntary sigh that escaped from him.\u00a0The last time he woke up, he couldn\u2019t even breathe heavily.All he had to do was keep breathing hard, and he couldn\u2019t even dare to take a deep breath like this.\u00a0(\uc5b5\uc9c0\ub85c \uac00\uc05c \ud638\ud638\ud761\uc744 \uc774\uc5b4 \uac00\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc804\ubd80\uc600\uc744 \ubfd0, \uc774\ub807\uac8c \ud06c\uac8c \uc228\uc744\ubab0\uc544\uc26c\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5c4\ub450\ub3c4 \ub0b4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud588\ub2e4.)Being able to breathe deeply was clearly a sign that body functions were returning to normal.Maybe it was an illusion, but he decided to think positively.It was painful to be alone in the darkness without a single light. The darkness made a person think a lot.Thoughts would flood in like a tidal wave, controlling over the mind and body. The overflowing thoughts would be enough to drive a person crazy.Even more for Pyo-wol, who was unable to move.The sense of isolation, as if alone in the darkness of the beginning, corroded his mind little by little.\u00a0If time continued to go by like this, it was clear that he would go crazy with his own thoughts.Therefore, Pyo-wol tried to think positively and cleared his mind.\u2018My name is Pyo-wol, fourteen years old, my father\u2019s name is Pyo-in-hak, and my mother\u2019s name is Lee Sun-hong.\u2019In the midst of his countless thoughts, he tried to think only of things related to his identity.The only way to keep one\u2019s mind intact in the onslaught of thoughts was to solidify his identity.He didn\u2019t know how much time had passed.It could have been just one day, or it could have been weeks.It was impossible to comprehend the flow of time in such deep darkness.Moreover, Pyo-wol\u2019s whole body was paralyzed.All the activity of the body had fallen to the floor.\u00a0(\uc2e0\uccb4\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ud65c\ub3d9\uc774 \ubc14\ub2e5\uae4c\uc9c0 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc600\ub2e4)As long as he was barely holding his breath, most of the functions were at a standstill.Because of that, he couldn\u2019t even feel hunger.\u00a0It was like dying alive.This was the most terrifying moment of Pyo-wol\u2019s life.To overcome the fear, Pyo-wol muttered endlessly.\u201cMy name is Pyo-wol\u2026Time continued to pass like that.* * *His fingers moved slightly.\u00a0It was proof that power was returning to his body.Although he wasn\u2019t sure what kind of expression he would be making because there was no light or mirror, his face must be glowing with joy.\u00a0Little by little, the sensation of the whole body was returning.Power entered his fingertips, and his sense of smell was revived.The damp smell felt through the tip of his nose was telling him that this place was underground, as Pyo-wol had guessed.However, the fact that this place was underground was not very important to Pyo-wol.The most important thing for him is that the senses of his whole body are returning.His fingers wiggled, and he could feel a cold sensation in his toes.Pyo-wol felt that he was alive. And he was grateful.It was unfamiliar for him to feel grateful just for the slightest sensation, but just being able to feel the fact that he was alive somehow made him feel more breathless.\u00a0(\uc774\ub7f0 \uc0ac\uc18c\ud55c \uac10\uac01\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub3c4 \uac10\uc0ac\ud568\uc744 \ub290\ub07c\ub294 \uc790\uc2e0\uc774 \uc0dd\uc18c\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5b4\uca0c\uac70\ub098 \uc0b4\uc544 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc744 \ub290\ub084 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub3c4 \ud55c\uacb0 \uc228\ud1b5\uc774\ud2b8\uc774\ub294 \uae30\ubd84\uc774\uc5c8\ub2e4.)Pyo-Wol was going crazy in struggling to maintain his identity. If only a little more time had passed like this, he certainly would have gone crazy. No, he couldn\u2019t even be sure if he was crazy right now.\u00a0No, that doesn\u2019t matter at all, he thought.\u00a0He was just happy to know that now the sensation of his limbs has returned.With a little more effort, he will soon be able to move his arms and legs.But there was one downside.\u00a0As the senses of his whole body returned, the functions of his organs were also revived.As the function of the organs was restored, he began to feel extreme hunger.The squeezing feeling in his stomach as if washing laundry was painful.His mouth was so dry that he could feel his own bad breath.It was then that Pyo-wol realized that he was dying.He couldn\u2019t eat anything while he was trapped here, so\u00a0(\uc774\uacf3\uc5d0 \uac07\ud600 \uc788\ub294 \ub3d9\uc548 \uc544\ubb34\uac83\ub3c4 \uba39\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud574 \uc544\uc0ac(\u622f\u6b7b)\uac00 \uc9c4\ud589 \uc99d\uc778\uac83\uc774\ub2e4.)It was clear that if he did not eat food for a few more days, he would die.There were only two options left for him.Go crazy, or starve.Peowol\u2019s mouth was twisted.Deep in his heart, anger rose toward the man who had locked himself here.Anger soon became hate. (\ubd84\ub178\ub294 \uace7 \uc0b4\uc758\uac00 \ub410\ub2e4.)\u2018What the hell did I do wrong?\u2019It\u2019s a question he had asked himself dozens of times. But no matter how much he thought, he didn\u2019t do anything wrong.He didn\u2019t even beg in front of the man.\u00a0He was literally just passing by.But the man had grabbed him and thrown him in this hellish place.Respect for human beings, courtesy towards oneself, etc. did not exist even after washing my eyes.\u00a0(\uc778\uac04\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc874\uc911, \uc790\uc2e0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc608\uc758 \ub530\uc704\ub294 \ub208\uc744 \uc53b\uace0 \ucc3e\uc544\ubd10\ub3c4 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\ub2e4.)No matter how insignificant he was, he shouldn\u2019t have been treated as inferior to an insect.At least if you\u2019re human.It was clear that the man did not consider himself human. That\u2019s why he had found himself in such a hellish place.\u2018Why?\u2019He questioned why he should be locked up here if he didn\u2019t do anything wrong.If he didn\u2019t do anything wrong, then there was no reason to be trapped here.Still, if he had been trapped here, it was clear that the man had done so with some clear purpose.Pyo-wol contemplated on what the purpose of the man was.But there was nothing he knew about himIf he knew anything about him, he could possibly infer even a little bit, but he didn\u2019t have any information about the man.Pyo-wol bit his lip.He felt the flesh ripping out and the blood flowing. Even after such a mess, his blood still seemed warm. That fact relieved Pyo-wol.He still felt like he was alive.\u00a0* * *Fingers moved.It was not at the level of being paralyzed like before, but it was enough to open and close it as he wanted.The sensation in his feet has also returned.Now he was able to turn his ankles slowly.The hunger was still the same. So it remained painful. Still, Pyo-wol was not frustrated.He looked like he was going to die of hunger, but the fact that his hands and feet were still moving\u2013 gave him hope.Pyo-wol held on to that glimmer of hope.\u00a0What he needed now was a faint hope that he could live.He knew well that the moment he let go of that hope, he would fall into a pit from which he could not climb again. So, he held onto hope like crazy and stretched out.One good thing is that the extreme hunger opened up all his senses.His nose smelled a variety of odors that he would never normally smell.The smell of moisture in the air, even the moisture rising from the floor.His ears were also wide open.His senses were so sharp that he could hear the faint sound of water running down the wall.What he needed most for his survival now was a sip of water.He really felt like he could sell his soul to the devil just for a sip of water.\u00a0\u201cHuo!\u201dA rough breath came from his lips.His mouth was dry and cracked like a dry paddy field, and his upper and lower lips were glued together. In such a situation, the sound of harsh breathing was squeezed out and it hurt as if his flesh was being torn.The more force was applied to the abdomen, the harsher breath flowed out, making it painful for Pyo-wol. Still, Pyo-wol did not stop giving strength to his abdomen.He didn\u2019t want to be hungry anymore.He didn\u2019t want to be thirsty any more.So, to turn over, he applied strength to the abdomen.He struggled to transmit the power from his abdomen to his limbs.He had been motionless for a long time, and his whole body was as dry as firewood.If he had time to spare, he would have studied how to slowly revive his muscles, but unfortunately he didn\u2019t have much time left.If he keeps on waiting like this, he will soon run out of breath.He had to move before that.\u201cKkeueu!\u201dIn the darkness, a groan like the cry of a beast rang out.Pyo-wol really did everything he could to death.His body trembled slightly as if his efforts had paid off.The excitement grew, and when it finally reached its peak, Pyo-wol exploded the ever-gathering power in a short time.\u201cKerhyuk!\u201dWith a scream, Pyo-wol\u2019s body flipped.He felt the touch of the floor on his chin and forehead.Pyo-wol shivered at the terrifyingly cold yet humid feeling. After a moment, Pyo-wol began desperately crawling towards the place where he could hear the sound of the running water.He wriggled like a snake and advanced a little.Sark! Sark!His jaw was torn and blood flowed on the floor, but Pyo-wol did not stop moving.Time passed like an apocalypse.\u00a0(\uc5b5\uac81\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \ud758\ub7ec\uac14\ub2e4.)He finally managed to stop himself and reach the wall.Blood splattered as he hit his forehead against the wall, but Pyo-wol didn\u2019t even feel pain.Pyo-wol stuck out his tongue.His tongue touched the wall.A refreshing feeling on the tongue.It was water.Pyo-wol licked the flowing water hurriedly in panic.\u201cHuh! Hoo-eup!\u201dIn the darkness, only the sound of him desperately drinking water echoed.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although it was a very small amount, it was the water of life that made Pyo-wol hold the string of life.Pyo-wol frantically licked the wall.It was only a little bit, but as the water entered his body, his hunger also went away a little.After drinking enough water, Pyo-wol\u2019s rationality returned little by little.\u201cHu!\u201dHe leaned his back against the wall and sighed.As the water was supplied to the body that had been afflicted with gamul, strength returned little by little to his dried up muscles.\u00a0(\uac00\ubb3c\uc774 \ub4e4\uc5c8\ub358 \uc721\uc2e0\uc5d0 \ubb3c\uc774 \uacf5\uae09\ub418\uc790, \ub9d0\ub77c\ube44\ud2c0\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uadfc\uc721\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ud798\uc774\uc870\uae08\uc529 \ub3cc\uc544\uc654\ub2e4.)Pyo-wol moved his arms and legs while breathing slowly.\u00a0As time went on, his joints were gently loosening. His muscles were also getting stronger.When he had sufficient strength, Pyo-wol leaned his back against the wall and tried to stand up.\u00a0\u201cOkay!\u201d\u00a0(\u201c\ub044\uc751!\u201d)A painful moan came out of his mouth, and veins spurted out of his forehead.Simply crawling on the floor and getting up with strength in both legs required a different level of strength and concentration of mind.It was a painful challenge for Pyo-wol, who had been lying on the floor for a long time with his entire body paralyzed.In his mind, he wanted to rest his back against the wall like before. But knowing that he could never get up if he did, Pyo-wol endured the pain and gave strength to his legs.Both of his legs were trembling, and cold sweat flowed down like a waterfall from his body. All the water he drank a while ago seemed to be drained out as sweat.\u201cTurn it off!\u201d\u00a0(\u201c\ub044\uc73c\uc73c!\u201d)Pyo-wol clenched his teeth and inhaled deeply.\u00a0(\ud45c\uc6d4\uc740 \uc774\ub97c \uc545\ubb3c\uba70 \uc816 \uba39\ub358 \ud798\uae4c\uc9c0 \ub04c\uc5b4\ubaa8\uc558\ub2e4.)His body shook as if he was about to fall soon. However, Pyo-Wol barely managed to hold on to his center of gravity.He eventually stood up on his own two legs.\u201cHoo!\u201dThe breath that had been suppressed came out.Pyo-wol wheezed as he stood holding his thighs with both of his hands.He couldn\u2019t confirm it because he couldn\u2019t see it, but Pyo-wol thought that hot steam would rise over his body.That\u2019s how hot his body was.Like a volcano just before it erupts.Pyo-wol had to spend a long time dissipating the heat.When the heat finally subsided, he looked around.All he could see was still a deep black darkness.Even though he had been here for quite a while, his eyes still did not adapt to the darkness.In the end, Pyo-wol gave up looking with his eyes. Instead, he reached out and touched the wall in front of him.The walls were slippery as water flowed for a long time.He felt fine protrusions as well as bites on my hands.\u2018Moss?\u2019Moss is always present when there is water flowing. In particular, such a humid place was the optimal environment for moss to grow.Pyo-wol skimmed the wall with the tip of his nail. When moss was caught on his nail, he ripped it off.He couldn\u2019t tell what color the moss was, nor can he tell what kind it was.Some moss is edible, but some can cause serious health problems. It could have been poisonous, or it could have harbored a disease.If he can see it with his eyes, he can easily decide, but now the only thing that Pyo-wol can get information from was the sense of his fingertips.Pyo-wol felt a twisting pain in his stomach.The hunger that he had forgotten for a while suddenly came back.Drinking water was nothing more than a temporary measure. He had to eat something.His fingertips alone wouldn\u2019t be enough to tell if the moss was edible. Still, the fact that he was holding moss in his hand made his mouth salivate.His worries didn\u2019t last long.Now was the time to eat something.Even if it\u2019s poison.Pyo-wol took the moss to his mouth.The mouth was tight.An indescribable hellish taste attacked his tongue. The taste was so terrible that Pyo-wol almost sat down and gagged.Knowing that once he sat down in his current state, it would be impossible to get up again, Pyo-wol forced himself to hold on.Water dripped from his eyes and nose.Since losing his parents, he has been wandering around the world and picking up all kinds of things, but he has never tasted something this horrendous.\u00a0It was such a taste that he didn\u2019t want to taste it again.Pyo-wol did not throw away the moss in his hand despite his streaming tears and running nose.\u00a0Hell was unfolding in his mouth, but fortunately he didn\u2019t feel any abnormality in other parts.If moss had harbored extreme poison, he would have lost his life as soon as it was eaten. Even if it did not have such an extreme effect, any abnormality should have been felt in the body.But he didn\u2019t feel any other abnormalities except that his taste buds were numb.It meant it was edible.Pyo-wol hastily scraped the moss and brought it to his mouth.Since his mouth was already paralyzed, he no longer felt the taste of hell. It was painful nonetheless, but once he got used to it, it was tolerable.Deaddeck! (\ub4dc\ub4dc\ub4dd!)Pyo-wol randomly scraped the wall and collected moss. When it is collected to a certain extent, he puts it in his mouth, and he repeats the act of collecting the moss.\u2018I can live. I can live somehow.\u2019Chewing the moss, Pyo-wol murmured.His tongue was almost paralyzed, and his voice never came out of his mouth, but his spirits were firm.He had to survive to get revenge on the man who imprisoned him here.At the very least, he would be relieved to find out the reason why he had been imprisoned here.He didn\u2019t know how much of the moss had been scraped off.There was no feeling of satiety. Still, the hunger went away to some extent.His tongue continued to tingle as if paralyzed.Pyo-wol caressed the area around his mouth with his hand. Fortunately, after some time, the sensation of his tongue returned to normal.Pyo-wol thought he was lucky.\u00a0It was a gamble that risked his life.He doesn\u2019t know how big the space he\u2019s trapped in, but there\u2019s a lot of moss on the wall, so he\u2019ll be able to hang on to his life for the time being. Of course, he will have to endure that hellish taste every time.Pyo-wol, who was standing and resting for a while, soon began to move, putting his hand on the wall.It was to estimate the size of the space in which he was confined.As he walked about ten steps with his left hand against the wall, a dead end appeared. It is blocked by the wall.He walked again along the blocked wall. Again, after about ten steps, a wall appeared.\u2018A rectangular space of about three square meters.\u2019\u00a0It was only then that Pyo-wol began to visualize the size and shape of the space in which he was confined.I could roll. (\ub9b4 \uc218 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4.)Pyo-wol continued walking along the wall.Chin!Then something was caught in my fingertips.It was a solid feeling, a different texture from moss.Pyo-wol moved his hand along the different area.\u00a0(\ud45c\uc6d4\uc740 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uac78\ub9bc \ubd80\uc704\ub97c \ub530\ub77c \uc190\uc744 \uc6c0\uc9c1\uc600\ub2e4.)It was a single line.A long and thin line.A square line like a space trapped by a table wall.\u00a0(\ud45c\uc6d4\uc774 \uac07\ud600 \uc788\ub294 \uacf5\uac04\ucc98\ub7fc \ub124\ubaa8\ub09c \uc7a5\ubc29\ud615\uc758 \uc120.)\u2018Is it a door?\u2019Pyo-wol knocked on the part that was supposed to be the door with his hand.Thump!A dull sound echoed in the underground space where he was confined.t was a distinctly different sound from the other parts.\u2018Big, thick iron gate.\u2019Pyo-wol fumbled and looked around for a device that could open the door. However, the iron gate was smooth with no protrusions or indentations.There was no way to open it inside. It seemed like it could only be opened from the outside.Pyo-wol couldn\u2019t figure out a way to open the door. But he didn\u2019t despair.He survived the starvation crisis.There was moss and water to hold on for a while. It will be difficult and painful, but he will be able to survive for a few days.Pyo-wol slowly sat down, leaning his back against the iron gate.Now there was no fear that it would never happen again.\u00a0(\u200b\u200b\uc774\uc81c \ub450 \ubc88 \ub2e4\uc2dc \ubabb \uc77c\uc5b4\ub0a0 \uac70\ub77c\ub294 \ub450\ub824\uc6c0\uc740 \uc5c6\uc5c8\ub2e4.)Now that he has filled his stomach, it\u2019s time to rest.In the darkness, only the sound of his breathing echoed.* * *Pyo-wol opened his eyes.In fact, it was unclear whether his eyes were open or still closed.He closed his eyes, but when he opened his eyes, all he could see was darkness.Pyo-wol lay still and tried to gauge how much time had passed.It didn\u2019t seem like a long time had passed since he didn\u2019t feel hungry.For the past few days, Pyo-wol had lived by eating moss on the walls.He thought he would never get used to it, but to his surprise, he got used to the hellish taste of moss.His tongue is still numb, but it doesn\u2019t feel as disgusting as it used to be.After solving his hunger like that, many thoughts flooded his mind like a tidal wave.It was quiet here.There was no sound outside.He couldn\u2019t see ahead, so he couldn\u2019t feel the passage of time.It was obvious that anyone would go crazy if they were locked up here.He had to hold his mind tight.\u00a0If he lowered his guard, he would lose himself and go crazy.Pyo-wol constantly repeated his name and tried not to lose his identity.There was no promise of how long it would last like this.When he was hungry, he scraped the moss on the wall and licked the running water.He had to persevere in order to survive.Pyo-wol thought that he was getting thinner and leaner.\u00a0Even if he wasn\u2019t, the fat that was unsightly was lost. Fortunately, he can still maintain his strength, but he did not know when the limit would come.The moss on the wall was not infinite.The day when all the moss disappears will be his last. Still, he thought he\u2019d stick with it until then.He didn\u2019t know why he was holding on so badly like this.If he would just give up, his body could have been more comfortable.He didn\u2019t know that if he died, he wouldn\u2019t have to suffer like this.Such temptations came often.Each time, Pyo-wol bit his lip and endured.Overcoming the temptation of death, his mouth was torn and bursting. There was no day when his blood would dry.\u00a0The wall suddenly felt peculiar. (\ud45c\uc6d4\uc740 \ubb38\ub4dd \uc778\uae30\ucc99\uc744 \ub290\uaf08\ub2e4.)When he looked up, he saw someone looking down at him.\u2018Who\u2019s there?\u2019He questioned.\u00a0The iron gate was clearly firmly shut.There was no sign of anyone coming in from the outside.Above all, it made no sense to see someone else\u2019s figure in this pitch-black darkness.Pyo-wol still couldn\u2019t see his hand.\u2018It\u2019s not real. Is it a dream?\u2019Pyo-wol raised his head and looked at the person looking down at him.The man with a skinny face and body and empty eyes strangely resembles himself.It was clear that if he had been skinny before he came in here, he would be like that.\u2018It\u2019s me.\u2019It was then that Pyo-wol realized that the man he was facing was another version of himself.It was exactly himself in a dream.Or, it was his true form lurking within.In an extremely cornered situation, one would start to see things that you would never see in the normal way.Pyo-wol asked his inner self.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u2014For what reason are you enduring so recklessly? Just let it go. If you let it go, it will be easier.His inner self replied.Pyo-wol narrowed his eyes.Because he didn\u2019t expect him to actually answer.He asked\u2014Why are you holding on so hard? For what reason when you don\u2019t have anything. What is a bastard who has nothing to protect endures so recklessly?\u201cIs there something I must protect?\u201d\u2014It\u2019s funny, why do you struggle so much because you can\u2019t afford to waste your life? Give up. Giving up makes it easier\u201cWill you really feel comfortable?\u201d\u2014What?\u201cWill it really be comfortable when you let go? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\u2014You\u2019re sick as hell.\u201cI\u2019m going to live. It\u2019s a life that I can\u2019t afford to lose. I\u2019m going to survive and see the end.\u201d\u2014You\u2019re talking nonsense.\u201cIt would be unfair to die like this. I\u2019ll put a knife on the guy who imprisoned me here. If I don\u2019t then I won\u2019t be able to close my eyes even if I die.\u201d\u2014 \u2026\u00a0\u201cSo, I\u2019m going to live. I\u2019m going to live like a vicious person and get revenge on everyone who made me this way.\u201dThe inner self squatted down and stared in each other\u2019s eyes.\u2014Are you really going to get revenge?\u201cYes.\u201d\u2014You won\u2019t give up?\u201cNever!\u201dHis inner self smiled, as if he liked Pyo-wol\u2019s answer.\u00a0Pyo-wol also smiled.Their smiles were strikingly similar.At that moment, Pyo-wol opened his eyes.His inner self was gone.\u00a0Pyo-wol realized that he had woken up from a dream. At the same time, he realized that the other self he had seen was not just a dream.It was his inner heart demon (\u5fc3\u9b54).If he hadn\u2019t been able to overcome the heart demon, he would have been devoured and gone insane. Or his ego would be split in two.Darkness drives people crazy.Pyo-wol had passed a new hurdle unknowingly.\u00a0\u201cHu!\u201dPyo-wol sighed.Chunkyung!Suddenly, the window at the bottom of the iron gate opened with a dull sound.The space was only small enough to fit one small plate.A faint light peered through the space.Even with the feeble light, Pyo-wol\u2019s eyes hurt as if they were about to explode.Eyes that have adapted to darkness react violently to weak light.Suk!A small plate popped inside. And the window was closed again.Pyo-wol\u2019s sense of smell was the first to respond.\u2018Food?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He didn\u2019t know what kind of food it was.It was clear that the mix of things was probably a collection of leftovers.Still, it will taste better than the moss that Pyo-wol had ever scraped. In fact, immediately after smelling the food, Pyo-wol\u2019s mouth was constantly drooling.However, Pyo-wol did not take food for granted.\u00a0It was the food given to him by the man who imprisoned him here.He couldn\u2019t tell the contents inside of the food.\u00a0If it contains poison then he can die.\u00a0He doesn\u2019t have a choice when it comes to eating moss.\u00a0However, the situation is different now.He can choose whether to eat the food in the plate or eat moss. After all, there was still plenty of moss left. So even if he doesn\u2019t eat this food right now, he can still survive for a while.That thought didn\u2019t stop from saliva drooling from the ends of his mouth. Still, he have time to deliberate about it.\u00a0He had to get information about the food.The means to get information in the dark, where a single light does not enter, were extremely limited.Since he cannot use his vision, which is the most convenient means of obtaining information, then it is necessary to mobilize the next developed sense, which is his sense of smell.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHoo!\u201dPyo-wol took a deep breath, almost sticking his nose to the plate.A lot of smells mixed in.It was as if the garbage had been collected in one place, and the various smells were mixed. Some were stinking, some still smelled edible.If it was the old him, he wouldn\u2019t be able to distinguish the smells mixed together. Before being imprisoned here, Pyo-Wol was just an ordinary boy. He was just a kid with no talent to stand out.However, while being trapped here, a great change took place inside him.He became vigilant and doubted everything.Even if it\u2019s a minor thing.Being trapped in an underground space without a single point of light for a long time made Pyo-wol\u2019s sense of smell as sensitive as a hunting dog.Pyo-wol soon distinguished the odors that could never be distinguished one by one. He wouldn\u2019t have been capable of doing this before if he was still living on the outside.\u00a0Peowol compared the odors he distinguished to those that remained in his memory.\u2018This smells like rotten fish and tea leaves. This is pork bone and the remaining shavings.\u2019The types of food in the small plate were incredibly diverse.It was incredible that Pyo-wol himself could distinguish all of these smells.There was no poison mixed in.\u00a0It was all the residue of food that someone had left behind.To some, it may be just rotting stinky food, but for him it was a valuable resource that provided a lot of information.There were more than five types of food that Pyo-wol managed to identify.It meant that there were enough people to eat at least five kinds of food.\u2018As I thought, I wouldn\u2019t be the only one.\u2019He didn\u2019t think they would have made more than three by three square meter underground all for himself. To prepare such a space, considerable funds and manpower were required.It meant that it was not a space that could be created by an individual\u2019s deviation or obsession.If there were five kinds of food, there was a high probability that five or more people ate it. Plus, the different degrees of spoilage in each food meant that the time they were eaten was different. This meant that several people ate at a time lag. The amount offered was too much for one or two people to eat.Above all, each food contained the scent of a different person.\u00a0There were only five body orientations that Pyo-Wol knew.\u00a0(\ud45c\uc6d4\uc774 \ud30c\uc545\ud55c \uccb4\ud5a5\ub9cc \ub2e4\uc12f\uc774\uc5c8\ub2e4.)It was clear that more than five people had imprisoned themselves here for some purpose.\u00a0\u2018No, I can\u2019t be the only one.\u2019\u00a0Pyo-wol thought that there would be others who were imprisoned besides himself.Using such a space to confine only one person is too expensive and inefficient.Pyo-wol organized his thoughts.\u00a0\u2018The number of people who manage this place is at least five, and the number of people in the same situation as me must be at least more.\u2019The thought bit the tail on the tail.\u00a0(\uc0dd\uac01\uc774 \uaf2c\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uaf2c\ub9ac\ub97c \ubb3c\uc5c8\ub2e4.)\u2018Those who locked us up would have made this place for some purpose. The problem is, what could possibly be their purpose?\u2019He could not yet guess the purpose of those who locked themselves here.This was because the information was too scarce to infer with only one unidentified food mixed with food waste.Pyo-wol did not worry.There was plenty of time left for him.After all, there was nothing else to do here.The best thing he can do to spend time with was thinking.If he continues to think, and think endlessly, he will one day be able to come across the truth.Fortunately, there was no odor that could possibly be poison from the unidentified food.Pyo-wol carefully began to eat his food.This was also a gamble.Nutrients other than moss were needed to restore stamina and muscle strength.\u00a0Even if it\u2019s a mix of garbage.After sorting out all his thoughts, Pyo-wol began to eat the unidentified food on the plate with his hands.Furuk! Slurp!The sound of him eating food echoed in the darkness.The food tasted terrible, but it was still more edible than moss.* * *Food was given at the same time once a day.The time was not actually accurate. It was just Pyo-wol guessing with his sense. \u00a0(\uc815\ud655\ud55c \uac83\uc740 \uc544\ub2c8\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\uc800 \ud45c\uc6d4\uc758 \uac10\uc73c\ub85c \uadf8\ub807\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc744\uae4c \ucd94\uce21\ud574\ubcfc\ubfd0\uc774\uc5c8\ub2e4.)The quantity given is such that a person can barely survive for a day.The food also tasted different every day.This is because different kinds of food are mixed every day. However, there were foods and spices that were always present.\u00a0(\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uaf2d \ube60\uc9c0\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc11e\uc5ec \uc788\ub294 \uc74c\uc2dd\uacfc \ud5a5\uc2e0\ub8cc\uac00 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4)It was pork offal and hot spices.Whatever food was mixed, these two were always included.That meant that it was easy for the personnel here to get pork and hot spices.\u2018A place rich in pigs and hot spices.\u2019There are very few places like that in the world.Pyo-wol has wandered the world alone since childhood. Thanks to that, compared to his peers, he had a lot more information.One of them was Sichuan Province.\u00a0There was a wide basin in the jar-like closed terrain.\u00a0(\ud56d\uc544\ub9ac\ucc98\ub7fc \ud3d0\uc1c4\ub41c \uc9c0\ud615 \uc548\uc5d4 \ub113\uc740 \ubd84\uc9c0\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud588\ub2e4.)For this reason, it was particularly famous for raising large numbers of wild grass-eating animals, particularly pigs and sheep. And the unbearable heat continued in summer due to the nature of the basin confined to the high mountain range, and people sought spicy food to beat the heat.Spicy food using pork and lamb was known as a symbol of Sichuan Province.Pyo-wol thought that this place was somewhere in Sichuan.I didn\u2019t know the exact place name, but I had a feeling that it would not be a place far away from Sichuan.\u2019\u2018Sichuan Castle is famous for its unique closeness.\u2019The word \u2018closed\u2019 also meant that it was an easy place to avoid other people\u2019s surveillance.In other words, the group that imprisoned Pyo-wol here was planning something to avoid the eyes of others, and it was clear that they had chosen a place in Sichuan Province as the location.It was never a good thing if they were trying to avoid the gaze of others like this.\u2018There\u2019s no way those who do good things can do such inhumane acts.\u2019Pyo-wol bit his lip.Blood bursted out and moistened his lips, but he felt no pain.This kind of pain is nothing because he was already used to extreme pain.Pyo-wol felt even great anger towards those who imprisoned him here.It was clear that he, as well as anyone, would be equally furious if they were trapped in this space for no reason and treated as nothing but a beast.Pyo-Wol suppressed his fiery anger.Feeling anger is in no way beneficial in this situation.He had to hide his anger and become more cold.\u00a0He had to figure out as much information as possible and use it to his advantage.No one had taught him, but Pyo-wol was learning his own way of surviving in the dark.Time passed.He guessed that he had been trapped here for at least four months by the amount of food he had eaten.The giver of food did not say anything to Pyo-wol.The small window was just mechanically opened once a day and supplied him with food.Pyo-wol also felt the limit of his mental powers because he couldn\u2019t talk to anyone for four months and was isolated in a dark space alone.More and more time was spent talking alone.After asking and answering by himself, he wondered if his mind was already split.But each time, Pyo-wol held on to his spirits like crazy.It was as if time had stopped here.Staying sane in a place like this has never been easier.In particular, it was easy to go crazy if he had nothing to do. So, what Pyo-wol chose was to move. He walked along the wall in a narrow space of three or more in all directions. He walked and walked and walked until he collapsed from exhaustion.He was like a hamster running on a wheel.\u00a0Calluses were formed on the soles of the feet, and little by little muscle started to form in the legs. When he remained standstill, his hunger was tolerable, but as he began to move, a feeling of extreme hunger tormented him.The food given once a day was insufficient. So he scraped up the walls and ate moss.He chose to eat moss to survive through the day despite the numbing hellish taste.\u00a0\u201cHoo! Hoo!\u201dPyo-wol\u2019s whole body was soaked with sweat.He would eat moss and roam the narrow space all day long. Thanks to this, he now has some muscle in his legs. The skin was still skinny due to a lack of nutrients, but it was not as weak as if it would break if he touched it with his fingers like before.When the leg muscles had gained some strength, Pyo-wol contemplated on doing some upper body exercises. He soon decided on doing push-ups. So his time now is split into walking and push ups.\u00a0The push-ups cause him as much pain as the first time he walked.At first, just doing ten repetitions made him out of breath. But as he endured the pain and continued trying, the number of repetitions increased day by day.A few months passed like that.Although he couldn\u2019t see it with his own eyes, Pyo-wol felt that his body had changed quite a bit.He was still skinny, but it was not just the skin that was covered like before, but strong muscles under the skin.Pyo-wol had to put in a lot of effort before this could happen.He was constantly fighting with himself, not with anyone else, to the point of collapsing.It was a different kind of pain from the initial hunger. Pyo-Wol learned how to endure such pain on his own. That wasn\u2019t the only thing he learned. He began to perceive the passage of time through his own internal body reactions.It is possible to measure the approximate flow of time through the defecation cycle, the time when the mind becomes clear, and various other body changes.There was another change.It was his eyes.His\u00a0 eyes began to adapt to the awful darkness.He didn\u2019t know when it started, but little by little the landscape around him slowly came into his eyes. It might just be distinguishing shapes and lines, but it was still a great progress.Pyo-wol was satisfied with at least being able to stop being blind.\u00a0The underground space he saw with his eyes was desolate as he expected. There was not a single piece of furniture in the square space.\u00a0On one side, the feces and feces excreted by Pyo-wol had accumulated and gave off a foul odor. And unidentified insects gathered to eat the feces.It was surprising that so many bugs lived in a dark space where there was no light.Pyo-wol looked at the swarm of insects from a distance. If he had seen such a sight before coming here, he would have been disgusted and frightened, but now he doesn\u2019t feel anything.Isolation in the dark wore out his emotions, and his capacity for feeling fear seemed to have been killed.\u00a0His wrist suddenly tingled.Surprised by the pain as if being stabbed by a needle, Pyo-wol looked at him and saw a small snake biting his wrist. It was a small snake with degenerated eyes like other bugs.The snake soon wrapped its entire body around Pyo-wol\u2019s wrist with a tight bite.\u201cHiss\u2026\u201dPyo-wol tried to get rid of the snake immediately. But at that moment, his eyes suddenly turned red, and the intense heat filled his head.\u2018Poison?\u2019That was the last thought he had before Pyo-wol lost consciousness.\u00a0The snake biting his wrist fell. The snake crawled away from Pyo-wol and went back with the other insects.\u00a0The food that snakes could eat deep underground was extremely limited. For the little snake, insects were its only food source.It was a coincidence that Pyo-wol was bitten by a snake that had come all the way to this place for the swarm of insects. The snake enjoyed its supper without paying any attention to the fallen Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol fell to the floor, unable to move.His whole body felt like it was on fire.The venom of a small, unknown snake was truly terrifying.Poison flowed through his blood vessels and attacked his whole body. Nerves and internal organs were attacked by poison.\u00a0 Despite the intense pain, Pyo-wol did not scream once. His whole body was so stiff that he couldn\u2019t even move.Pyo-wol\u2019s eyes were wide open in extreme pain. His eyes were red as if blood had burst all over and he was about to pour out blood.\u00a0As the poison attacked his body, the heat continued to intensify.\u00a0Pyo-wol could not even let out a scream and had to endure the pain.It would have been less painful if he had lost consciousness, but perhaps it was the effect of poison, his mind was rather clear. So he had to feel the excruciating pain vividly with his bare mind.Three days passed in excruciating pain.The last three days felt more painful and longer than the time he had been confined in the underground space.Different parts of Pyo-wol\u2019s body were broken as he endured the pain by clenching his teeth.\u00a0It was almost three days after the paralysis was relieved.\u00a0(\ub9c8\ube44\uac00 \ud480\ub9b0 \uac83\uc740 \uc0ac\ud758\uc774 \uac70\uc758 \uc9c0\ub0a0 \ubb34\ub835\uc774\uc5c8\ub2e4.)The numbness that bound his body as if it were a lie was released, and the heat in his body disappeared.In the end, he won the battle against poison.He managed to hold on to his life, but the result did not come easily.He overcame the poison, but most of his internal organs, muscles, and nerves were damaged. He will recover to its original state over time.\u00a0He has no energy to move right now but he forced himself to. Pyo-wol crawled towards the only door leading to the outside.A plate of food was placed in front of the iron gate.His mouth was dry and he couldn\u2019t feel any taste, but he had to eat something to survive.Pyo-wol crawled like the snake that poisoned him.After crawling for a while, Pyo-wol, who barely reached the iron gate, hurriedly put his face into the plate. As he licked the food, Pyo-wol murmured.\u201cI won\u2019t die. No matter what!\u201dHis eyes, now bright red in the darkness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He almost died because of the snake\u2019s venom. But he felt no animosity.\u00a0The cold reptile was the first one to settle down in this underground space earlier than him. If anything, Pyo-wol was the one intruding.\u00a0Pyo-wol did not particularly hate or fear the snake since it did it out of survival. The snake had to bite for it to live.\u00a0The snake slaughtered a large insect at the corner where Pyo-wol usually deposited his feces.\u00a0While his eyes had slowly adapted to the darkness, he had never seen so clearly as he does now. It seemed that some change had taken place inside his body when he fought against the poison that penetrated him.\u00a0\u2018Is this poison tolerance?\u2019He had heard of stories of people becoming stronger from surviving after being poisoned before.Pyo-wol thought that it would be the case for himself.The problem was that not only did he gain resistance to poison, some changes have also taken place in his body. It seemed that the poison had a synergistic effect and affected his eyesight.There was only one way to confirm his guess.Pyo-wol caught the body of the snake that was eating an insect and returned to where he was prior.\u00a0The captured snake immediately opened its mouth wide and dug its fangs at the back of Pyo-wol\u2019s hand.The effect was immediate.He could feel the heat rising from the back of his hand. It was enough proof that the poison had started to penetrate his body.Pyo-wol prepared for the pain by gritting his teeth. Having resistance to the poison did not diminish the pain at all.\u00a0Like Pyo-Wol predicted, he could feel the excruciating pain at the site of the snake\u2019s bite. Scorching heat rushed through his veins as if it was trying to burn his whole body.It was painful.He almost regretted his decision. But the pain was more bearable than he thought.The first bite had left him completely paralyzed, while the second time did not. Sure, it was still painful, but he can still endure it.\u00a0When a day passed, the pain started to completely disappear.\u00a0Pyo-wol was soon convinced that he had finally developed poison tolerance.It may only be towards a certain type of poison, but it was clear that he had his own weapon that others didn\u2019t know about.His vision also seemed to have gotten a little clearer.\u2018Okay!\u2019For the first time, a smile graced\u00a0 Pyo-wol\u2019s lips. It was the first smile he made after being locked up in an underground space.After that, another change occurred in Pyo-wol\u2019s daily routine.Once a day he let the snake bite his wrists. He knew that his body had developed a tolerance, but Pyo-wol never intended to be satisfied with his current level.He wanted a more perfect immunity. So he repeatedly let himself be bitten by the snake every single day.\u00a0He also observed the behavior of the snake. The tiny snake with degenerated eyes was the only intelligent creature in the subterranean space, besides Pyo-wol.\u00a0When he stared at what the snake was doing, he can see that it rolls its head. (\ubc40\uc774 \ud558\ub294 \uc9d3\uc744 \ubcf4\uba74 \ub098\ub984 \uba38\ub9ac\ub97c \uad74\ub9ac\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.)Snakes were exceptional hunters.It can approach the prey without making a sound and kill it at once. It stealthily conceals its presence so that even vigilant insects will not notice.Occasionally, there would be insects who noticed the appearance of a snake, and when that happened, it made a peculiar cry of \u2018washing\u2019. Then, the movements of the worms hardened like a lie.\u00a0(\uac04\ud639 \ubc40\uc758 \ub4f1\uc7a5\uc744 \ub208\uce58\ucc44\ub294 \ub140\uc11d\uc774 \uc788\uc5c8\ub294\ub370, \uadf8\ub7f4 \ub54c\uba74 \u2018\uc53b\u2019 \ud558\ub294\ubc40 \ud2b9\uc720\uc758 \uc6b8\uc74c\uc18c\ub9ac\ub97c \ub0c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\uba74 \ubc8c\ub808\ub4e4\uc758 \uc6c0\uc9c1\uc784\uc774 \uac70\uc9d3\ub9d0\ucc98\ub7fc\ub531 \uad73\uc5c8\ub2e4.)It can incapacitate its prey using sound.\u00a0But even so, the snake is not greedy. It doesn\u2019t make the mistake of intimidating insects around it and chasing them away.\u00a0The appearance of such a snake attracted Pyo-wol\u2019s interest. So besides dedicating his time in training his stamina, Pyo-wol would also come and observe the snake. For Pyo-wol, watching the snake was his only means of entertainment.\u00a0Pyo-wol unknowingly fell in love with the snake\u2019s movements. To increase his strength, he tried to imitate the movement of a snake as he walked around the room.He practiced trying to navigate through the darkness without a sound or presence.The days went by quickly with him doing the same thing over and over. Pyo-wol routine would consist of eating the served food, observing the snake, and training his body. Pyo-wol had to constantly repeat these three actions in order not to go crazy.\u00a0Otherwise, he would have already gone crazy, engulfed in terrible pain.\u00a0Eating food, training the body, observing and imitating snakes was the only way to lose weight.In the darkness, Pyo-wol was resembling a snake little by little.* * *Clang!Pyo-wol opened his eyes to the sudden vibration.\u00a0In an instant, a look of disbelief appeared on his face.It was because the iron door that had kept him locked up here for a long time was opening on its own.Pyo-wol stood up.Soon the iron door was wide open.There was no difference in scenery between the inside of his room and the outside. The pitch-black darkness that covers his eyes and the humid air that irritates his skin remained.\u00a0Pyo-wol came out of the iron gate and looked around. Outside the door was a large hallway.On his left side were numerous rooms with doors all wide opened. Perhaps, all of the rooms had opened simultaneously. The hallway has no end in sight.\u00a0Pyo-wol moved to the room adjacent to his room. He had to walk approximately twenty steps to reach the next room. Given the size of his room which was only about three square meters or around ten steps in each direction, there would be another ten steps left that would serve as a barrier in between the rooms.\u00a0\u2018So that\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t sense the presence of others.\u2019\u00a0No matter how sensitive his senses were, it would not be able to overcome the thickness of the wall.\u00a0Pyo-wol looked inside the room.\u00a0An awful stench stirred his nose.\u00a0It was the smell of rotting flesh.\u00a0Someone\u2019s body had been left decaying in the darkness. The foul odor indicated that the decomposition had already progressed considerably.Pyo-wol went into the room and inspected the body, ignoring the foul smell. The deceased had its face collapsed, so he couldn\u2019t tell in much detail, but judging from the built of the skeleton,\u00a0 he could tell that it was a boy of the same age as him.\u00a0Perhaps the boy was also imprisoned here at the same time as him. The situation in the other rooms was the same. In each room, either a boy or girl of a similar age as Pyo-wol was dead.Unlike Pyo-wol, they could not endure hunger and died of starvation.Their room was as humid as Pyo-wol\u2019s room so it was full of moss. They probably did not seem to consider consuming the moss. Maybe they weren\u2019t able to adjust well to the darkness like he did and hence failed to notice the moss growing around the room.\u00a0A bowl of rotten food was placed in front of their own doors. Similarly with Pyo-wol\u2019s case, the food was also rationed. But they must have been picky and left the food untouched.\u00a0In the darkness, Pyo-wol\u2019s eyes flashed red.He continued to walk straight down the hallway.Twenty rooms passed. And twenty bodies were also found. One corpse per one room.Pyo-wol soon reached the end of the hallway. There was a large iron door blocking the hallway. The iron gate was much thicker and larger compared to the ones that blocked their rooms.\u00a0The bolts of the gate were also taken out.Pyo-wol pushed the door hard and the towering iron gate opened slowly.\u00a0Beyond the iron gate, the same hallway where Pyo-wol had been imprisoned continued, and again, twenty iron gates were lined up in a row.The only difference is that there was only one survivor in the area where Pyo-wol was, but in the new section, there were as many as two survivors here.It was a boy and a girl who seemed to be of the same age.They looked in the direction where Pyo-wol appeared with wary eyes. Judging by their actions, it seemed that their eyes were not perfectly adapted to the darkness like Pyo-wol.\u00a0It was clear that they had noticed the appearance of a new character through the sound of Pyo-wol\u2019s footsteps. Their pricked up ears were proof.Pyo-wol only looked at them without saying a word.Both the boy and girl were skinny, as if they had not eaten properly. But compared to Pyo-wol, they still seemed to be in better shape.Pyo-wol glanced at the next room. A body was seen through the door. He could see a food bowl next to the body.There\u2019s no doubt that there was a sufficient amount of food. So it was either that he died because he could not stand the loneliness and died of madness, or he could not overcome the disease he had acquired underground.One of the survivors spoke cautiously.\u201cWho are you? Where did you come from? He and I are the only survivors in this section.\u201dThe question was directed to Pyo-wol.\u00a0Pyo-wol looked at the girl who asked the question. She was a girl who did not lose her beauty despite being locked in the basement for a long time. She was staring in the direction of the wall, like a cat full of poison.However, it seemed that she could not recognize Pyo-wol\u2019s appearance since her eyes were not focused. The boy next to the girl also looked in the direction of Pyo-wol with a very wary look.\u00a0If it was too late, it had the momentum to attack Pyo-wol.\u00a0(\uc5ec\ucc28\ud558\uba74 \ud45c\uc6d4\uc744 \uacf5\uaca9\ud560 \uae30\uc138\uc600\ub2e4.)Their eyes weren\u2019t able to fully adapt to the darkness like Pyo-wol but their sense of hearing and smell still developed by leaps and bounds. It is for that reason that they manage to take notice of Pyo-wol\u2019s arrival and become vigilant.\u00a0Pyo-wol opened his mouth.\u201cMy name is Pyo-wol. I was locked up in the adjacent area.\u201d\u201cArea next door?! So are you saying there are other places like this?\u201d\u201cIt seems so.\u201dIn response to Pyo-wol\u2019s answer, the girl bit her lip. The girl, like Pyo-wol, did not know they ended up here and was captured here and lived for several months.Even as everyone in each of the trapped rooms was dying, she clenched her teeth and endured it until she eventually survived.It was the same with the boy.He has outstanding mental strength who succeeded in overcoming the feelings of despair and loneliness day by day.Pyo-wol asked,\u00a0\u201cWhat are your names?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m So Yeowol. And he is Song Cheonwoo.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cGo where?\u201d\u201cI think there are more areas like this.\u201dPyo-wol\u2019s gaze was on the other side of the hallway. There was also a huge iron gate similar to what Pyo-wol had passed through.It was proof that another section existed.So Yeowol and Song Cheonwoo did not recognize the existence of the iron gate that divided the different sections because they did not have eyes that could see through the dark.So Yeowol\u2019s voice trembled.\u201cOh my God! There\u2019s more places like this?\u201d\u201cFollow me.\u201dPyo-wol took the lead.So Yeowol and Song Cheonwoo followed the sound of his footsteps.If they had held hands, they could walk faster, but Pyo-wol didn\u2019t. Giving up your hand meant that he would not be able to use it in an emergency. It\u2019s like giving out a weakness.\u00a0Even though no one had taught him that, Pyo-Wol was aware that in order to survive he must not let anything easily slip into his gap.\u201cHold my hand.\u201dSong Cheonwoo reached out to So Yeowol.Pyo-wol thought that she would hesitate for a moment, but So Yeowol immediately grabbed Song Cheowoo\u2019s hand and followed behind Pyo-wol.\u00a0As they moved on to the next area, they saw more survivors. This time there were five.\u00a0Like Song Cheonwoo and So Yeowol, they also gathered together and shared information.They were alarmed by the sudden appearance of Pyo-wol, So Yeowol, and Song Cheonwoo. However, So Yeowol came forward and explained it calmly, and soon the boundaries were softened.Pyo-wol glanced into the room as the others were having a conversation.Most of the rooms also had decomposing bodies.\u00a0Unlike Pyo-wol\u2019s section, only a few people died of starvation. Instead, most of them showed signs of self-harm. Some had their heads broken, and others showed signs of strangulation. They must have been unable to endure despair, loneliness, and fear so they chose to commit suicide.It was a harsh environment for children in their teenage years to endure. It only make sense for them to commit suicide.\u00a0The next thing Pyo-wol looked at was at their food bowl.\u00a0It was definitely bigger than the food bowl in the area where Pyo-wol was confined, and the amount of food was greater.At least in terms of food, it was clear that they received more rations than the area where Pyo-wol was confined.\u2018Were they discriminating?\u2019Whatever the purpose of those who imprisoned them here, it was clear that they managed it by giving each section a different level of treatment.\u00a0In comparing the sections he has observed, the environment in the area where Pyo-wol was confined was the harshest. It was a miracle in itself that Pyo-wol managed to survive there alone.However, the children who are talking outside did not seem to realize that fact.\u00a0When Pyo-wol came out, So Yeowol sensed his presence and said.\u201cThese children were also imprisoned at the same time as us. This is Lee Min, and Go Shinok,And as if they had already shared a common name, So Yeowol introduced the children as the representative.Pyo-wol silently remembered their names.In the third district, Lee Min and Go Shinok stood out.Lee Min was a beautiful girl similar to So Yeowol, while Go Shinok was a very handsome man. \u00a0 He had such a beautiful face outline and appearance that he could not be considered a man. There were probably a lot of girls who fell for him when he was outside.Lee Min spoke towards the direction she assumed where Pyo-wol was.\u00a0\u201cHello, I\u2019m Lee Min. I\u2019ll be in your care from now on.\u201d\u00a0He did not know what he was asking for, but Pyo-wol silently nodded his head. (\ubb34\uc5c7\uc744 \ubd80\ud0c1\ud558\ub294 \uac74\uc9c0 \uc54c \uc218 \uc5c6\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud45c\uc6d4\uc740 \ub9d0\uc5c6\uc774 \uace0\uac1c\ub97c \ub044\ub355\uc600\ub2e4.)The survivors continued moving on to the next section.\u00a0There were a few more survivors in the next area. Around eight people survived.Whenever they moved to other sections, the number of survivors continued to increase.In the end, the number of those who survived reached a whopping 100 while the number of those who died were more than doubled.\u2018Three hundred people were put in, and only one hundred of them survived.\u2019It\u2019s not normal for three hundred young children to be imprisoned. No matter how big Sichuan Province is, if three hundred children went missing all at the same time, the powerful sects will not remain silent.\u2018But if they expand their range to other parts of the world then they probably won\u2019t be noticed.\u2019In the case of Pyo-wol, he was arrested in Honam which was far away from Sichuan. So Yeowol and Song Chun-woo were also orphans so perhaps others are as well.Even if they disappeared, no one would care and look for them.\u00a0 They were the perfect target for anyone to carry out some secret conspiracy.Pyo-wol opened the door to the next area. However, the scenery that appeared this time was different from what he had imagined.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 5": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayA huge underground cave stretched out before their eyes.The underground cave was so huge that if not for the torches hanging all over to light up the place, it would be impossible to even guess the size.\u201cAhh!\u201d\u201cOw\u201dCries coming from the children bursted from all over the place.After being stuck in a place where there has been no light for the past few months, suddenly being exposed to a torch hurts so much as if their eyeballs were about to burst out.It was painful for Pyo-wol too. Tears streamed down his eyes as if they were being stabbed by thousands of needles at the same time. Pyo-wol tried to adapt to the sudden bright light with his eyes half-closed.\u00a0It took him a long time to get used to the light because his eyes had already perfectly adapted to the darkness.After a while, Pyo-wol finally managed to adjust to the light while the majority still couldn\u2019t open their eyes. Pyo-wol paid them no attention and proceeded to look inside the underground cave.The cave seemed to have been formed naturally. The huge stalactites hanging from the ceiling were proof.\u00a0 The cave\u2019s structure was that it narrowed as it went up, like a bowl that had been turned upside down. Inside of the cave was full of buildings made out of wood.\u00a0\u201cThe buildings were made crudely as if they were modeled after a manor.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhat is this?\u201dThe children, who recovered their sight belatedly, were surprised to find the buildings. It was already amazing to find such a huge underground cave. But seeing the wooden buildings standing in the middle which were definitely made by human hands made them vigilant.\u00a0Pyo-wol strode towards the building.So Yeowol and Song Cheonwoo quickly followed behind him, followed by Lee Min and Go Shinok.Pyo-wol looked into the building at the entrance, and said.\u201cThere are no people here.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dA light of suspicion appeared on So Yeowol\u2019s face.\u00a0 They continued to search all the other buildings, but they haven\u2019t found anyone.\u00a0The children had bewildered faces. They were wary that they would discover another person, but they didn\u2019t know what to do now that they\u2019re alone.\u00a0While the children were bewildered, Pyo-wol didn\u2019t stop inspecting the building.\u00a0The building wasn\u2019t very old. Judging from the condition of the wood, it was clear that it was made recently. The grain of the wood and the dust that had accumulated on it made it clear that it was made during the time Pyo-wol and the children were locked up in each section.As a result, the building itself was in poor condition.From the outside it looked fine, but on the inside, it was terrible. Only the appearance looked okay,\u00a0 but the inside was so crude that it was impossible for a person to live.It was as if they had deliberately constructed it that way on purpose.\u00a0Pyo-wol thought there must be a reason.One of the truths he learned while wandering the world alone is that everything happens for a reason. If a beggar who was begging next to him was beaten to death, it meant that he had no eyes that could accurately judge the person he was begging from.If\u00a0 someone offered food to him, they must also have a reason for doing so. Probably the figure of the beggar would have reminded them of their child or someone close to them.\u00a0So sometimes Pyo-wol was beaten to death.The reason was simple.Because the person he was begging for wasn\u2019t very good.Pyo-wol\u2019s eyesight was already sharp as he had many experiences at a young age.Because of that, even the slightest strange point didn\u2019t go unnoticed. Pyo-wol came out and looked at the layout of the building. The building itself is very rough, but the layout is excellent.Even Pyo-wol, who is not familiar with architecture, knew that the buildings were arranged intentionally. But anything beyond that, Pyo-woul couldn\u2019t find out.Then, someone approached Pyo-wol.\u201cIt\u2019s you, Pyo-wol!\u201dThe girl who spoke in a soft voice was Lee Min he met in the third district. It was the first time for Lee Min to see Pyo-wol in person. Unlike Pyo-wol, she doesn\u2019t have eyes to see through the darkness.Lee Min narrowed her eyes and looked at Pyo-wol.Eyes set under dark eyebrows, a towering nose, and tightly closed lips. Although he was very skinny and his cheeks were sunken, he still had a very handsome face. However, it was not Pyo-wol\u2019s appearance that Lee Min paid attention to.It was his eyes.Pyo-wol\u2019s pupils, with their hollow eyelids above them, were tinted with a soft reddish tint from the light. She doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of the torch or if it\u2019s the eye\u2019s original color, but it felt very mysterious.\u201cWas it always like that?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cYour red eyes.\u201d\u201cMy eyes are red?\u201d\u201cYes! Looks like you didn\u2019t know. Then, it must\u2019ve happened to you when you were here.\u201dLee Min reached out and touched Pyo-wol\u2019s face.Pyo-wol stood still and accepted Lee Min\u2019s hand. He was so immersed in his thoughts that he was unaware of her touch.\u2018Are my eyes red? Could it have something to do with snake bites?\u2019Being different from others is never a good thing.Especially when there are so many children gathered together.Children are accustomed to instinctively detect and reject beings different from themselves. Most of the children Pyo-wol had seen while wandering the world were like that.Fortunately, his eyes did not turn completely red.According to Lee Min, his eyes would appear to have a faint reddish tint when there\u2019s a torch nearby, but otherwise it\u2019s not very visible normally.\u00a0Pyo-wol thought that was a good thing.\u00a0Lee Min asked.\u201cWhat are you thinking so hard about?\u201d\u201cJust\u2026 this and that.\u201d\u201cYou are different from other children.\u201d\u201cHow so?\u201d\u201cYou just are. While we\u2019re all here confused, you\u2019re the only one thinking deeply.\u201dLee Min stared at Pyo-wol. Pyo-wol also looked into her eyes.\u201cWhat are you two doing over there?\u201dSo Yeowol and Song Cheonwoo approached them.\u201cJust talking.\u201d\u201cTalking?\u201d\u201cJust about this and that.\u201dLee Min shrugged.So Yeo-wol looked at Lee Min-eun with a puzzled look. But only for a while and said to Pyo-wol Pyo-wol with a nonchalant expression.\u201cA few kids decided to group themselves together. What do you guys want to do?\u201d\u201cAbout what?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re coming with us, right?\u201dSo Yeowol said with a very natural expression, and Song Chun-woo, who was behind her, nodded and agreed with her.Pyo-wol looked at them for a moment and then opened his mouth.\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean you\u2019ll see? Are you saying you won\u2019t be joining us?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just saying that I\u2019ll wait to see how things go.\u201dPerhaps Pyo-wol\u2019s answer was unexpected, So Yeo-wol was unable to speak for a moment. Song Cheowoo looked like he was about to get angry at any moment. But being with So Yeo-wol calmed his anger.He realized that being isolated for a long time in the dark will cause someone to lose their mind.Some have succeeded in holding onto their identity with strong mental powers, but not all of them can. What\u2019s more is that the people who are now trapped in this underground space were only children in their early to mid thirteen years.Since they are imprisoned in a state where their mind is not fully developed, the breakdown of their ego was particularly serious. It may not appear on the surface right now, but no one knew what trouble it would cause in the future.Pyo-wol didn\u2019t want to mix with them yet.Pyo-wol did not trust the other children. He doesn\u2019t even believe in himself.He may have looked normal, but he can\u2019t tell if he had already developed some kind of problem mentally. On Pyo-wol\u2019s dumbfounded look, So Yeowol gave a confused expression for a moment.But she quickly smiled and spoke softly.\u201cCome back anytime you change your mind. Our door will always be open.\u201dPyo-wol just nodded his head without saying a word.So Yeowol looked at Lee Min.\u00a0\u201cHow about you? What are you going to do?\u201d\u201cMm\u2026\u201dInstead of answering, Lee Min looked at Pyo-wol and So Yeowol alternately.Her troubles didn\u2019t last long.\u201cAlright! I\u2019ll join you. It\u2019s much better to stay together than to be alone.\u201dLee Min went to So Yeo Wol\u2019s side.The three went back to where the other children were, shoulder to shoulder, and Pyo-wol, who was left alone, looked at their backs.* * *After only a few hours of getting to know each other\u2019s faces, the children soon found a group similar to themselves.The group was divided into groups led by So Yeo-wol and Song Chun-woo, a group led by a child named Kang Il, a group led by a boy named Yeom Iljung, and a group headed by a boy named Go Youngsan.The children who became the heads of each group have a remarkable and outstanding presence. Other children instinctively grouped around a leader with similar tendencies, and factions naturally formed in the underground cavity.Pyo-wol did not belong to any faction and watched the children.The children berated Pyo-wol and told him he was unlucky.\u201cYou said there were no other survivors in the mouth where that bastard was?\u201d\u201cEveryone else died so how did he survive alone?\u201d\u201cCould he have killed them all?\u201dUnfounded rumors spread. Everyone knew that Pyo-Wol couldn\u2019t kill others because they were all individually locked up in solitary confinement. Still, the rumors spread secretly.Although there were only a hundred or so, the world of children in the underground cave was no different from the world outside. They become similar to adults who are vigilant and jealous of someone differing from the majority and pushed them aside.\u00a0He was no different. He was explicitly being ostracized, but Pyo-wol didn\u2019t seem to care. It\u2019s because he has been through a lot of things like this while wandering the world alone.Above all, Pyo-Wol could not afford to care about the children.It was because there was not enough time just to seek survival.Pyo-wol roamed the underground cavity all day long. The first reason was to find out if there was a place to escape, and the second reason was to figure out the origin of the underground cavity. Although the structures in the underground cavity were recently improvised, it was clear that the underground space where he and his children were confined was built a very long time ago.It took at least several to several decades for the moss to form on the wall.There was a time gap of at least several years to decades between the room in which he was confined and the buildings here.Pyo-wol came to a conclusion.\u2018The underground space was built a long time ago. It\u2019s already been abandoned but for some reason, someone is reusing it recently.\u2019The problem is the reason for reusing it.\u00a0Perhaps they were the original owners of this underground cavity, or they could have discovered it by chance. Whoever it was, it was clear that they have enormous financial power. Otherwise, it would be impossible to build such structures in such a short time underground.Pyo-wol was so immersed in thought when suddenly,\u00a0Clang!\u00a0Suddenly, a dull sound resounded from the basement ceiling.Pyo-wol and the children\u2019s eyes turned to the ceiling.A ray of light seeped in then a rope with a large basket came down.There were various kinds of food in a basket large enough for one person to eat.\u201cIt\u2019s food!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s eat!\u201dThe children cheered. The children\u2019s hunger was at its peak because they hadn\u2019t eaten anything since leaving their confinements.\u00a0 The children rushed towards the basket like an anglerfish.Because they had been starving for quite some time, the eyes of the children were turned upside down when they saw something to eat.\u201cWait!\u201dAt that time, So Yeowol and Song Cheonwoo stopped the children and shouted.\u201cWhat the hell!\u201d\u201cGet out of the way!\u201dThe children were, of course, angry.They growled as if they were about to attack the two of them at any moment. However, So Yeowol was not afraid and said calmly.\u201cWhy don\u2019t we share it equally among us?\u201dHer gaze was directed at the heads of each group.Kang Il, Yeom Iljung, and Go Youngsan, the heads of each group, each nodded in agreement with her. They stepped forward on behalf of each group. And they distributed the food in the basket.Then Pyo-wol stepped forward.\u201cWait!\u201d\u201cWhat are you?\u201dYeom Iljung looked at Pyo-wol with fierce eyes. So did the other bosses.Their eyes were full of poison to the point that even adults would shudder. The long imprisonment has turned the children into beasts.\u00a0Those who imprisoned children here created a hundred ferocious beasts.Anyone who faced such children\u2019s eyes would be saddened. However, Pyo-wol was no different from the children.An animal that grew up eating poison and despair in the dark.That kind of gaze and pressure didn\u2019t work on him.Pyo-wol calmly picked up the food and answered.\u201cI\u2019m going to take my share too.\u201d\u201cPut that down!\u201dYeom Iljung grabbed Pyo-wol\u2019s wrist. When Pyo-wol looked at him without saying a word, Yeom Iljung gave even a more ferocious expression.\u201cNo one can take the food from the basket without our permission. Everything in this basket is under our control.\u201dHe looked at So Yeowol and the other leaders. So Yeowol and others nodded their heads in agreement with his words.An easy way to control the group you lead is to take control of their lifeline\u2014 food.Although they\u2019re still young, they knew they had to get their hands on food to ensure they had control over the other children.In other words, food was power.They had no intention of giving power to anyone but themselves.This is especially true for loners who go out alone without being able to form a group like Pyo-wol.It was then.Puk!\u201cAck!\u201dSomething that no one had expected happened.All of a sudden, Yeom Illjung uttered a desperate scream.In Yeom Illjung\u2019s eyes, Pyo-wol\u2019s fingers were embedded. Pyo-wol pierced his left eye with his index finger.\u201cWhat did you say? Say it again.\u201dPyo-wol asked indifferently, putting his finger in Yeom Iljung\u2019s eyes.His eyes were glowing red like when a torch was nearby.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, Pyo-wol grabbed Yeom Iljung\u2019s neck with his opposite hand and made it impossible to move.The index finger of his right hand was still inserted into Yeom Iljung\u2019s eye.From the perspective of Yeom Iljung, a mixture of liquid and red blood was flowing out. Many children shut their eyes at the terrible sight.For the past few months, living in isolation and full of poison, he was just a child who had not yet matured. They might have instinctively gathered and formed a group, but no one here was prepared to kill the other children.That was the difference between them and the Pyo-wol.\u00a0He was the only one who survived in the harshest environment.He was willing to kill other children in order to survive.So the result was a finger stuck in Yeom Iljung\u2019s eye.\u201cI told you to say it again\u201d\u201cAH!\u201dYeom Iljung gave all his strength to get out of Pyo-wol\u2019s hand, but he remained immovable.While the other children hoped and waited for the iron door to open, Pyo-wol trained his body. The difference was huge between the growing children.\u201cLet go of that hand! You crazy son of a bitch.\u201d\u201cFuck! Let go of him right now!\u201dChildren following Yeom Iljung surrounded Pyo-wol.At that moment, Pyo-wol put his finger deeper into Yeom Il-jung\u2019s eyes.\u201cGAH!\u201dThe desperate screams of Yeom Iljung continued to echo in the underground cavity.The eyes of the children, who were about to run to the creepy sight, fell down. This behavior of Pyo-wol was far beyond their imagination. They could never have imagined that there would be such a person in the same age group as them.\u00a0They remember a viper from the figure of the Pyo-wol. A small snake with a lot of poison that once bites it, it never lets go.No one dared to stop Pyo-wol. They felt like they were going to get beaten up by Pyo-wol if they dared to do something.So Yeowol came out. She came in front of Pyo-wol.\u201cHe\u2019s not in a situation where he can answer. Stop it.\u201d\u201cWhy should I?\u201d\u201cHe should have understood after you did that much.\u201d\u201cWhat about food?\u201d\u201cNo one will touch your share.\u201dSo Yeowol\u2019s last words were directed towards the other children.No one opened their mouths to answer, but their intentions were conveyed to Pyo-wol.At that time, Pyo-wol pulled out the finger that had been stuck in Yeom Iljung\u2019s eye and released the hand that was holding his neck.\u201cUgh!\u201dYeom Iljung sat down on the spot and covered his pierced eyes with the palm of his hand. He looked at Pyo-wol gritting his teeth.\u00a0\u201cYou, you bastard\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat? Do you want me to do the same thing to your other eye? If you wish to be blind then go ahead. My fingers are strong enough to pierce your other eye.\u201d\u201cCrazy\u2013 you bastard!\u201dYeom Iljung grinded his teeth. In his heart, he wanted to hit him to death, but the atmosphere in the hall was dominated by him. The other children have already been devoured by Pyo-wol\u2019s momentum.It was impossible to expect a reversal in this atmosphere.In the end, Yeom Iljung had no choice but to step back while covering his wounded eye. Pyo-wol looked at him for a moment, then backed away holding his portion of food.So Yeowol whispered to him.\u201cWhat are you going to do now? You turned them all into enemies.\u201d\u201cEven if they didn\u2019t turn into my enemies, I already consider everyone here as my enemies anyway.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dInstead of answering, Pyo-wol shrugged his shoulders and moved on. The children in front of him stepped aside. Pyo-wol passed by them and climbed onto the roof of a nearby building.The roof of the building has the best place to monitor the area. With what he did to Yeom Iljung just now, Pyo-wol made all the children in the underground cavity hostile. The highest place was chosen because it was necessary to monitor whether children would secretly approach him during their eating time.The food in Pyo-wol\u2019s hand was a rice cake. It had been a long time since they had been made, so the rice cakes were hard and tasteless. However, Pyo-wol silently chewed the rice cake without complaining.As he sat on the roof and surveyed the view, he could see the surrounding landscape in more detail.\u2018This is a test, a test to filter out useful children.\u2019Throwing the children one by one in a space completely cut off from the outside was a clear process to filter out useful children. Such a process could not end immediately. This process would be repeated over and over again, and it was clear that many children would continue to die in the process.He could think of cooperating with other children to fight back, but Pyo-wol did not believe that things would turn out so smoothly.It was their intention to drive so many children into one place.It will certainly put the children at risk by testing them in one way or another.Until now, they still haven\u2019t appeared and were still forcing the children to survive on their own. If so, it was clear that the same method would be used this time as well.Making children kill each other or making them suspicious of each other.\u00a0\u2018If that happens, everyone will be each other\u2019s enemy.\u2019If they were going to be an enemy anyway, it doesn\u2019t matter if they become his enemy a little earlier. Because he would be able to examine the situation a little more clearly.Pyo-wol looked at the panoramic view under the underground cavity for a long time.* * *Food came down once a day, always at the same time.As the food came down, each group fought a nerve war to get even a little more food.Food was directly related to survival, and in order to increase the probability of survival even by a little, the children tried to secure even a little more food.As time passed, the children\u2019s antagonism grew more and more intense. The more it happened, the more prominent the presence of the children who served as the heads of each group became.It was definitely So Yeowol, who showed the greatest presence among the leaders. So Yeowol, who is a woman, secures the most food for her group. Then after securing as much food as possible, she still only ate the smallest amount.And she took good care of the children who followed her. The strong loyalty of the children who followed So Yeowol was natural.\u00a0The next largest group was Kang Il\u2019s group.\u00a0Kang Il had a very quiet personality. He was so silent to the point of not saying a word all day. Nonetheless, he took great care of the children who followed him. He was the type of person who showed his leadership through actions instead of words.The group led by Go Youngsan has a strong personality. It may be because Go Youngsan has a bubbly personality, but the personalities of the children who followed him were somewhat similar.Finally, there was a group led by Yeom Iljung. At first, many children followed Yeom Il-jung, but when they saw him lose one of his eyes and was humiliated by Pyo-wol, many children left.For that reason, Yeom Il-jung harbored great resentment towards Pyo-wol. Pyo-wol knew that, too, but he didn\u2019t pay much attention to it.He would only take his share of food and disappear somewhere else.\u00a0Many children thought of him as\u00a0 a thorn in their eyes. However, the brutality of Pyo-wol when he dealt with Yeom Iljung had left such a strong impression on them that they were reluctant to confront him.So they can just monitor Pyo-wol\u2019s actions from afar.\u00a0Pyo-wol was constantly the subject of their attention. Numerous children were keenly aware of his movements. Except when eating food, Pyo-wol was confined to the underground area where he was imprisoned. Each room was cleaned by putting the scattered bodies in one place.\u00a0The other children did not understand Pyo-wol\u2019s actions, who preferred to stay alone in the deepest part. The place where Pyo-wol occupied was in the deepest darkness where it was impossible to see anything ahead.Pyo-wol, who returned to such a place on his own feet, would only look strange in their eyes. But Pyo-wol didn\u2019t care about what others thought at all. He chose the underground space where he was confined because he thought it was the safest place.\u00a0It was good to live in an underground communal space, but there was no freedom of movement because it was open on all sides. No matter how secretly they move, they cannot escape the gaze of the children.For that reason, Pyo-wol spent most of his time in the space where he was first confined, training his stamina, or developing his tolerance to poison by being bitten by a snake.Having lived with snakes made them his close friends.\u00a0At some point, even when he was bitten by a snake, he no longer felt any pain. It seemed that he now had complete tolerance for their poison.Pyo-wol came out, rubbing his wrist that had recently been bitten by a snake. As he came out of the dark room, he could feel the secret glances the children threw from everywhere. The other children are watching him come out.The children were hostile towards Pyo-wol, who chose a lifestyle greatly different from theirs. They could not understand Pyo-wol, who chose to live alone without a group. However, Pyo-wol looked at the ceiling, not paying any attention to their gaze.Now it was time for the food to come down.When the basket came down, the leaders such as So Yeowol and Kang Il were already there.Still, because they were the leaders, they were quite proud. Yeom Iljung was staring at Pyo-wol with his one eye. Despite the ferociousness in his eyes, there was also a fear.\u00a0Kang Il and Go Youngsan were also wary of Pyo-wol, but did not show any particular hostility. The only one who expressed good feelings towards Pyo-wol was So Yeowol.\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s good staying in a dark place where you couldn\u2019t even see anything in front of you? Instead of staying by yourself like this,\u00a0 why not come and join our group?\u201d\u201cI believe I\u2019ve already answered that question before.\u201d\u201cShouldn\u2019t your answer change depending on the situation?\u201dDespite Pyo-wol\u2019s blunt words, So Yeowol did not lose her smile. It was so pretty that it made his eyes dizzy when she smiled lightly.So Yeowol\u2019s face gained some weight because she ate well and was comfortable. As her health improved, her dazzling beauty also came back. Her beauty was also a big factor in leading her group.In fact, many of So Yeowol\u2019s followers are those smitten with her beauty.Pyo-wol looked at So Yeowol without saying a word.He found her beautiful.After all, he was also a man.Although he was young, he was mature enough to serve as a man. If it had been before he came here, he would have succumbed to So Yeowol\u2019s beauty and followed her.But the hellish times of the past few months have instilled in Pyo-Wol a strong patience. He thought more deeply than before, and started to doubt everything around him.\u00a0\u00a0He didn\u2019t trust the children here yet. No, he couldn\u2019t.\u00a0That was then.There was a dull sound from the ceiling, and a basket of food came down.All the children\u2019s eyes turned to the basket.Kang Il murmured.\u201cAren\u2019t there going to be idiots like Gu Ji-pyung again?\u201dGu Ji-pyeong was the name of a child who died a while ago.He made a plan to escape outside by getting in the basket. When the children had all their food, he climbed into the empty basket. However, while the basket was being pulled up high in the air, the rope that tied the basket from above was suddenly cut off.\u00a0In the end, Gu Ji-pyeong fell to the floor and died horribly.\u00a0The basket did not come down for three days after that.During that time, the children had to starve.It was a clear warning.If something like that happens again, they will starve again.Children who learned the lesson the hard way did not dream of escaping through the basket liek Gu Ji-pyeong ever since.\u00a0Tak!\u00a0Finally, the basket of food came down to the floor.The expressions of the children looking inside the basket changed.\u201cWhy is there only this much?\u201d\u201cThe amount of food has decreased.\u201d\u201cWhat\u201dThe smile disappeared from So Yeowol\u2019s face, and the other leaders couldn\u2019t hide their bewildered expressions.Securing food was of paramount importance in this closed place.At first glance, food was reduced by almost a quarter.It could have been seen that there was not much difference, but the amount was so small that it reminded them of starvation (\u9913\u6b7b) for children who were barely satisfying their hunger.\u00a0The evidence was that even the head children could not hide their bewildered expressions.\u00a0(\ub2f9\uc7a5 \uc6b0\ub450\uba38\ub9ac \uc544\uc774\ub4e4\ubd80\ud130\uac00 \ub2f9\ud639\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ud45c\uc815\uc744 \uac10\ucd94\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\uadf8 \uc99d\uac70\uc600\ub2e4.)In the darkness, a red tint lingered in Pyo-wol\u2019s eyes.\u2018It has begun.\u2019He thought they would pick out the children in one way or another, but he expect that they would choose such an extreme and primitive method.Already, a hideous atmosphere was sensed among the children.So Yeowol and the other leaders looked at each other. So far they have fairly distributed the food. Although the quantity was insufficient, they were able to fill the stomachs of the children who followed him to some extent.However, since the amount of food has decreased, it was unimaginable to fully satisfy their hunger. It would be nice if they stopped at this level, but Pyo-wol predicted that the food would decrease further considering their behavior so far.\u201cI\u2019m only taking this.\u201dPyo-wol only took care of his share with a glance. The food in his hand has significantly been reduced as compared to before.So Yeowol and the bosses\u2019 eyebrows twitched. So far they have implicitly acknowledged the share of Pyo-wol. This was because Pyo-wol left a strong impression.But things have now changed.Even the small amount that Pyo-Wol takes seems to be a waste. The only reason they haven\u2019t done anything is that the amount has decreased for the first time today. It\u2019s is not clear how long it would last.\u00a0In their minds, the quantity decreased today, but there was a feeling of expectation that it might return to its original state tomorrow.That\u2019s why they just let him go even though he looks at Pyo-wol.But the Pyo-wol knew.\u00a0Those good times will never come back again.And, as he had guessed, the food was noticeably reduced every day.\u00a0And one day something terrible happened that should not have happened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 7": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMak No-sam was a boy who survived the last section and joined the group led by So Yeowol.Although he has the smallest build among So Yeowol\u2019s group, he had pulled his weight through sheer tenacity.\u00a0And that small man was lying on the floor dead. His appearance was truly miserable, as he had been brutally beaten up to the point of death. His face was mutilated to the point of being unrecognizable, and his body was full of black bruises.The appearance of the Mak No-sam was enough to bring out the anger of So Yeo-wol and the crowd\u201cWho the hell did this?!\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t let this go! You bastards!\u201dThe children burst out in anger.It was difficult to believe in their eyes.There was only one reason for the death of Mak No-sam. He was the weakest link of So Yeowol\u2019s group. And it is said that he has a habit of sparingly eating his rationed food.\u00a0There were traces of food on his hands. It meant they were attacked before eating.Song Cheonwoo frowned and asked the children.\u201cDid anyone see who did this?\u201dEveryone shook their heads.\u201cDamn! We need to know who did this to get revenge.\u201dSong Cheonwoo burst out in anger.Even though he wanted to take revenge, he couldn\u2019t do it because he didn\u2019t know the culprit which made him even more furious.\u00a0So Yeowol opened her mouth.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who made Mak No-sam this way. The important thing is that someone who followed us died.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cEven though Mak No-sam is dead, if we decide to stay still, everyone will start to look down on us.\u201d\u201cYeah but to get revenge, we need to know our opponent\u2013\u201d\u201cBut it will be too late. It will take at least a day or two to find the person who killed Mak No-sam, and if we fail to find the culprit, we\u2019ll just be wasting our time and that will certainly make the other groups look down on us.\u201d\u00a0\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\u201cWe must take revenge now in the same manner\u2026\u201dSo Yeowol did not say who the subject of their revenge will be. But Song Cheonwoo already has an idea who she\u2019s talking about.\u00a0A weak and powerless child like the youngest among the other groups.They were So Yeowol\u2019s targets.That night, the group led by So Yeowol moved secretly. And the weakest child in the group led by Go Youngsan died.It was the beginning of the war.* * *Pyo-wol scratched the wall with his fingernail.It\u2019s been a while since he had scraped his hands against the wall recently. Pyo-wol brushed a considerable amount of moss that he had gathered into his mouth at once.It still tasted disgusting, but it was still better than starving.The children\u2019s war also affected Pyo-wol. The war was so brutal that it was hard to believe that it was conducted by children in their early to mid-teens.It was difficult at first, but once they saw others\u2019 blood spilled, the children stopped being hesitant.\u00a0If they don\u2019t find the courage to kill someone then they will be the ones who would die.Food was scarce, and it was impossible for everyone to share equally. In such a situation, the children chose to reduce the mouths to feed one by one.From the beginning, harmony and coexistence among them was impossible.Every time a night passed, someone was always found dead.One night, it would be one of So Yeo-wol\u2019s group that had died, and on another day, the child would be from Yeom Iljung\u2019s group.\u00a0When the situation came to this, distrust flared up.The children who belonged to some groups began to leave one after the other. Since the leader decided that he could not completely protect them, he decided to survive on his own.So the four large groups were divided into eight smaller groups.The children did not trust each other. The food became less and less day by day, and the children\u2019s fighting grew fiercer.The already hellish underground cave literally became hell in itself.No one could be relieved, and no one can guarantee one\u2019s own survival.Hunger-stricken children have become as ferocious as beasts (\u7e54\u9b3c).\u00a0Fortunately, the children have yet to reach the point of entering the space where Pyo-wol is staying. Children instinctively still felt fear towards the space they were initially confined in.In particular, the deep darkness which hinders them from seeing anything ahead, greatly stimulated their fear. Even if they were holding a torch or light, they would still hesitate in coming into such darkness.\u00a0Thanks to this, Pyo-wol has been able to live more comfortably than the other children. He can eat moss peacefully.\u00a0But that peace seemed to have ended today.Thrack!A small rustle came to Pyo-wol\u2019s ears. It was the sound of footsteps rubbing against the floor. The sound was so subtle that it would never be detectable by someone unless they have sensitive hearing like Pyo-wol.\u2018They\u2019re here.\u2019In the dark, Pyo-wol\u2019s eyes shone sharply.It wasn\u2019t just one or two.At least four people were moving together.Pyo-wol\u2019s residence was in the deepest area, so it was not a place where one could accidentally get lost. It was a place that could never be reached unless someone visits intentionally. So, the people who appeared here must have come to Pyo-wol for a certain purpose.A bad one at that.\u00a0\u201cAre you sure this is the right place?\u201d\u201cY-Yeah, I\u2019m certain\u201d\u201cWhy is it so dark? I can\u2019t even see anything in front of me.\u201dThe voices of the visitors echoed in the darkness.They tried to whisper, but given that there was no furniture or objects in the room that could absorb the sound, their voices still resonated quite loudly.Then one of the children set fire to the torch he was holding in his hand. He wanted to move as secretly as possible, but when his vision was limited due to the darkness, he had no choice but to light a torch.When the torches were lit, their faces were revealed.They were Yeom Il-jung and the three more children who followed him.After losing one eye to Pyo-wol, Yeom Iljung was waiting for a chance to get his revenge. However, the memory of the day he lost his eyes to Pyo-wol was so strong that he couldn\u2019t help but hesitate.\u00a0Even though he was the leader of a group, he was only in his early and mid-teens. It\u2019s never easy to shake off the fear once imprinted in one\u2019s head.If not for the lack of food, the children would be in a peaceful situation. This would consequently cause Yeom Iljung\u2019s revenge to be delayed.\u00a0However, the sudden decrease in food led to a fight among children. As the death-and-death situation took place every day, his fear of Pyo-wol faded away.Yeom Iljung himself killed as many as two children. He became a beast that has tasted the blood of others. He thought that now was the moment to overcome his fear by killing Pyo-wol.After killing Pyo-wol, he will fight So Yeowol and Kang Il and become the sole leader of the underground community.That was the end goal of Yeom Iljung.\u00a0Yeom Il-jung held a torch and lit every corner of the room. But Pyo-wol remained nowhere to be seen.\u201cWhy\u2026 Is he not here?!\u201d\u201cN-No\u2026 I\u2019m certain he went here.\u201d\u201cDamn it! Where is he?!\u201dA bewildered expression appeared on the children\u2019s faces.That was then.\u201cAHGH!\u201dSuddenly, a child shrieked.\u00a0 Yeom Iljung snapped his head towards the child in surprise.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cS\u2026 Something bit my foot..\u201d.Thud!The screaming child did not speak and stepped back. When the torch illuminated the child\u2019s face, his face had turned black and foam started to form in his mouth.\u201cHuh?\u201dThump!Then they heard something creeping into the darkness.Yeom Iljung held the torch towards the area the sound was heard, but there was nothing there.\u00a0\u201cUgh!\u201dThen another child screamed.When Yeom Iljung turned his head quickly, he saw his henchman already lying on the floor. And then came the sight of a black object moving rapidly.The black shadow moved in an instant and moved behind the last boy\u2019s back.\u201cYou bastard!\u201d\u00a0The boy who was the target of the black shadow swung his fist. Like the other children, it was a fist covered in someone else\u2019s blood. While he\u2019s not as remarkable at anything else, he was confident enough to make a fist.His fists were sharp and elaborately aimed at the black shadow\u2019s head.But at that moment, the black shadow\u2019s head flickered like a candle in the wind and disappeared from view.\u201cK-Kughkek!\u201dThen the boy suddenly found himself unable to breathe. The black shadow quickly appeared behind him and stuck to his back like a cicada.The black shadow was Pyo-wol.\u00a0Pyo-wol\u2019s strong arms were wrapped around the boy\u2019s neck like a snake. The boy\u2019s face turned white in an instant. The blood vessels in the neck are blocked and the blood supply to the brain is cut off.\u201cYou bastard! Let Jongha go!\u201dYeom Il-jung pointed a torch at the Pyo-wol and yelled.\u00a0The strong light created dark shadows on Pyo-wol\u2019s face. The dark shade made the Pyo-wol\u2019s impression more intense.There was a glimmer of fear in the eyes of Yeom Iljung, who was looking at Pyo-wol. The fear that he had struggled to suppress was instantly revived when he saw Pyo-wol. This kind of fear is like mold, and no matter how much you scrub and wipe it, it will grow and pollute your mind.There was a mixture of embarrassment, confusion and fear in his remaining eye.It was because in an instant, all the children who came with him were mercilessly attacked by Pyo-Wol. The fact that he did not even see how Pyo-wol used to suppress the children further amplified his fear.\u201cK-Kuhgh! Kuugh!\u201dThe boy, who had been suppressed by Pyo-wol, was running out of breath. If time continues to pass on, the boy will surely die. Both Pyo-wol and Yeom Iljung knew that fact.Pyo-wol knew he was at a crossroads. If he kills the boy here, Pyo-Wol would become a murderer. He will become exactly what the creators of this place want him to be.He thought that a moment like this would come one day, but that moment came faster than he expected.Pyo-wol could decide to not be a murderer and not have blood on his hands.It all depended on his choice.\u00a0The red tint in Pyo-wol\u2019s eyes which was only reflected by a torch if it\u2019s nearby was visible. Seeing Pyo-wol\u2019s eyes, Yeom Il-jung had an ominous feeling and shouted,\u00a0\u201cN-NO!\u201dHowever, Pyo-wol did not care and gave more strength to his arm. He could feel the struggle of the boy as he was strangled by his throat. But after a moment, the boy had his tongue stuck out as he dropped to the ground.\u00a0He has no vital signs.His breathing stopped, and his body temperature gradually cooled.That was the boy\u2019s end.Pyo-wol did not delay his decision in becoming a murderer.The creators of this place forced the children to make decisions, and those who did not reach their desired standards would be cut off.\u00a0It was natural selection.\u00a0Throng!The boy\u2019s body collapsed as Pyo-wol relaxed his arms.\u201cY-You\u2013\u201dYeom Iljung took a step back. The momentum he had when he decided to come here had long since disappeared.\u201cHey, you devil-like bastard! To kill Jongha\u2026\u201dHe himself also killed several people, yet Yeom Iljung still cursed at Pyo-wol for killing the boy.Pyo-wol doesn\u2019t have an excuse. He still considered himself weak.\u00a0But actually, he was not weak. Adapting to the darkness, he was more poisonous and stronger than Yeom Iljung.\u00a0Even Yeom Il-jung instinctively recognized that fact.The fear that Pyo-wol had planted on him was like a fungus that continues to firmly stick in his mind.\u00a0 Even if he lets him live here, Yeom Iljung will never be able to stand up to Pyo-wol again.\u00a0The fear that Pyo-wol had planted in Yeom Iljung\u2019s heart was terrifying to that extent. Yeom Iljung who had his two legs trembling and his face with sweat droplets flowing incessantly had proved that.\u00a0Pyo-wol approached him.\u201cSa, save me! If you spare me, I will become your subordinate. You\u2013 you will need a subordinate like me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be obedient at the beginning. But as time goes on, your fear of me might lessen, and you will do the same thing again.\u201d\u201cN-No! You\u2019re wrong! Never\u2013\u201dYeom Il-jung, who was shaking his head quickly, opened his eyes wide. It was because the figure of Pyo-wol in front of him suddenly disappeared.\u201cHu\u2013?\u201dBefore he can even find Pyo-wol,\u00a0Bam!Suddenly, a shattering pain overtook him. Pyo-wol\u2019s fist exactly hit the tip of his chin. His brain shook, blurring his vision. Pyo-wol put his arm around his neck, not missing that moment.With his right arm, he pulled Yeom Iljung\u2019s neck, and with his left arm, he pushed his head forward.Yeom Il-jung struggled with the suffocating pain.\u201cGAHG! S-Save m\u2026\u201dYeom Il-jung begged, but Pyo-wol did not release the arm wrapped around his neck.\u00a0Pyo-wol murmured with strength in his arms.\u201cThe reason I\u2019m killing you is because I\u2019m still weak.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This was because both Yeom Iljung and his henchmen were found dead. Their corpses shocked the children who were busy quarreling in the underground cave.\u00a0As food decreased, murder became a routine, but never did so many children die at once. Moreover, one of the deceased was Yeom Iljung, the leader of a group.Although he was humiliated by Pyo-wol once, no one could ignore Yeom Iljung.\u00a0Yeom Il-jung was one of the strongest in this underground community, and even the strongest group headed by So Yeowol could not afford to do anything about him.But Yeom Iljung and his henchmen were all killed.No one among them admitted that they killed the group of Yeom Iljung.So Yeowol, Kang Il, and Go Youngsan were silent.The children knew the meaning of their silence.\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s Pyo-wol.\u2019\u2018He killed the whole group of Yeom Iljung.\u2019After the murder amongst the children, Yeom Iljung openly talked about killing Pyo-wol.

To kill four people alone.\u2019\u2018That demon-like child.\u2019\u2018You can\u2019t be enemies with that bastard.\u2019It was a moment when the fear toward Pyo-wol was deeply engraved in the minds of the children.Since then, the children\u2019s fight for food continued. Children continue to die day after day, but no one dared to go to the place where Pyo-wol was staying.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s clever and spiteful. He obviously knows how to make people fear him.\u201dGo Youngsan murmured. He was also the leader of a group. As he tried to save his group, he, too, was forced to kill.Some children even said this.\u201cWhy don\u2019t we negotiate with the other groups instead? If we reduce the amount we eat even a little bit, we don\u2019t have to kill each other like this.\u201dBut in spite of his words, those who locked them here had their food distribution reduced to almost three quarters. They couldn\u2019t tell how much food would be further reduced.\u00a0In order for the children to survive, they had no choice but to kill.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dGo Youngsan sighed and looked at his group.In the beginning there were twenty, but now only seven of them were left. Some went out to live separately, and some lost their lives in the process of fighting.The size of Go Youngsan\u2019s group shrank.There was another thing that changed.The eyes of all those who survived were full of poison. The children, who had never even killed a dog before being kidnapped here, have now become toxic enough to kill without hesitation.In order to obtain food, they had to kill others.Even though it was already difficult to get food, they still always end up hungry because of the lack of quantity.\u00a0Because of the circumstances, there was always a vile intention in the eyes of the children. There are still some food left so they can still endure it, but if the food is cut off, they might start to crave human flesh.\u201cPyo-wol, that guy had predicted this moment would come. That\u2019s why he took Yeom Iljung\u2019s eyes at that time and didn\u2019t align himself with any group\u201d.They all knew they were going to be murderers anyway. And at the most opportune time, he killed one of the leaders and imprinted in everyone\u2019s mind the fact that he was the absolute strongest amongst them.\u00a0Go Youngsan once again trembled at Pyo-wol\u2019s scheme.\u00a0He was one of the older kids here. He had a lot of experience and had met a lot of people. However, there were not many people who had a vicious heart at such a young age as Pyo-wol.He told his other members.\u201cYou guys, never touch Pyo-Yeol. He\u2019s a different kind of guy.\u201d\u201cBut he\u2019s alone\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what makes it scarier. There\u2019s nothing scarier than a bastard who has nothing to protect. Don\u2019t even try to approach him, alright?\u201d\u00a0\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dThe children could not help but agree.\u00a0\u201cBoss!\u201dThen a child came running from the other side. It was the child Go Youngsan sent for reconnaissance. His feet are fast and he is quick-witted.\u201cWhat? Why are you running?\u201d\u201cUh\u2013 there are two kids over at the red house in the north, I guess they\u2019re the ones who fell out of the So Yeowol\u2019s group.\u201d\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\u201cYeah! I checked it several times.\u201dAt the child\u2019s confident answer, Go Youngsan bit his lips for a moment.\u201cWhat about their food?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure that they have potatoes in their arms. If we don\u2019t go now, they\u2019ll eat it!\u201dAt the words of the boy who had been scouting, an urgent expression appeared on the children\u2019s faces.The children were hungry enough to consider murder for just one potato.Go Youngsan frowned. He thought about it for a while, but he had already decided.\u00a0\u201cWhat about the opening?\u201d\u201cI already figured it out.\u201dMost of the children were scattered and living in a war zone that someone had made. Although only the outside looks satisfactory and the inside is crude, a ray of hope still shines through. Because it\u2019s better than living in an unknown underground area.\u00a0It was the same reason why children were unable to leave the war zone even after the food scramble broke out. Most of all, it was here where the baskets of food came down.Leaving this place meant moving away from the food source, and for the children, it meant falling behind in the food battle.They had to stay here, dead or alive.Because of these circumstances, they were enamored with the geography of the area.\u00a0Where can they sneak in and where can they get out?They clearly knew which places were advantageous for a surprise attack and which places were unfavorable. It was the same with the other groups.After fighting fiercely, they had completely mastered the geography of the interior of this place. But nevertheless, there was bound to be a secret passage that others did not know.The dog hole Go Youngsan mentioned was one of those places.They moved to the dog hole.As the boy who scouted said, there were two children peeling potatoes.The moment they saw the potato, the eyes of the children led by Go Youngsan changed dramatically.\u00a0\u201cPotatoes!\u201d\u201cKill them!\u201dEven before Go Youngsan gave an order, the children rushed towards the two who were holding the potatoes.\u201cN\u2026 No!\u201dGo Youngsan shouted late, but he could not control the children whose eyes had already turned over. The children ran like an ogre. So the children holding the potatoes were startled and ran away.\u2018Something is strange.\u2019A light of doubt appeared on Go Youngsan\u2019s face.Pak!Suddenly, an intense scream rang out.Go Youngsan looked up and saw a child running from the front with a broken head and collapsing. Behind the alley, someone swung a club and smashed the child\u2019s head.The children who had been hiding in the alleys and nearby fences were revealed.\u201cDamn it! It\u2019s a trap. Everyone back off!\u201dGo Youngsan realized that they had fallen into a trap and shouted, but it was already too late.The children, led by So Yeowol, completely surrounded them.\u201cSo Yeowol!\u201dAs Go Youngsan yelled, So Yeo-wol and Song Cheonwoo appeared from among the children.\u201cHo-ho! I caught a big fish with just one potato, we can reduce the mouths to feed by a lot this time,\u201dSo Yeowol let out a cold laugh. Her face was painted with a victorious smile.\u00a0\u201cHow dare you\u2013!\u201d\u201cWhat can you do by staring like that?\u201dCrack!Go Youngsan grinded his teeth. Their situation was really grim. They were outnumbered, and the terrain was to their disadvantage.\u00a0\u2018To make a mistake like this\u2026\u2019He felt the agitation of the crowd. Everyone was clenching their teeth, but there was an uneasy feeling in their eyes.Go Youngsan stepped forward and said,\u201cCan\u2019t you just end it with my life?\u201d\u201cThe food situation is not good for that\u2014\u201d\u201cWill you only be satisfied after killing them all?!\u201d\u201cIf you were in my position, you would have done the same thing too. Why are you pretending otherwise?\u201dThe request of Go Yeongsan did not work for So Yeowol.Her face remained cold.Food coming from the outside was becoming less and less. If the number of people is not reduced accordingly, everyone will end up starving to death.\u00a0 This was not the time to care at the situation of the other group.\u201cKill them all.\u201dA cruel command fell from So Yeowol\u2019s mouth.The group following her rushed towards the group of Go Young-san.\u201cARGHH!\u201d\u201cKill them all!\u201dThe children twisted together and fought. The children\u2019s movements were clumsy because they haven\u2019t even learned the basics of martial arts. However, their intention to kill their opponent was no less than that of an adult who had mastered martial arts.So it appeared more brutal.The sight of children pounding their opponents\u2019 faces until they shattered with clenched fists and biting their opponents\u2019 flesh with their teeth looked devastating.It is never easy for a man to kill another person with his bare hands.Children are doing things that are difficult for adults to do. They didn\u2019t look like people at all.The children look like beasts that have gone wild.\u00a0\u201cKUGGH!\u201d\u201cH-HELP ME!\u201dScreams and clamors rang out dizzyingly. It was Song Cheonwoo who faced Go Youngsan.Song Cheonwoo put Go Yeongsan into a corner with such agility that others wouldn\u2019t be able to believe that he was a child who still hadn\u2019t mastered martial arts.So Yeowol did not intervene in the fight.Instead, she looked around and monitored carefully the other children who had gathered because of the commotion.But the other groups did not dare to intervene in the fight.This is because the power of the group led by So Yeo-wol is much stronger. A sense of danger that they could be annihilated by a counterattack made them hesitant in trying to aim for So Yeowol.\u00a0Pyo-wol watched the two groups fight on the roof of a nearby pavilion. The fight was about to end in favor of So Yeo-wol\u2019s group. It was a\u00a0 one-sided victory.Pyo-wol watched their fight from start to finish.From So Yeowol planning a trap to Go Youngsan being properly caught, he saw everything. They used the terrain thoroughly. They tried to deceive each other\u2019s eyes using open holes and all sorts of shortcuts, and lead the situation to their advantage.What Pyo-wol paid attention to was how skillfully they used the terrain, just like the courtyard of their house.Suddenly he muttered.\u201cSo it was like that\u2026\u201dNow it seems Pyo-wol understood what the captures wanted from them.The way the children are now will be what they want them to be.\u201cThere is a high probability that this place is a miniature or replica of an actual place. And there is a high possibility that it is a gentian blood that cannot be compared with this place.\u201dOne of the things that Pyo-wol felt while watching the entire fight was that it would be almost impossible to infiltrate if there were proper security everywhere.The creators of this place wanted children to get accustomed to this place.\u00a0 They seemed to want no hesitation as they tried to kill each other.There was only one answer.\u201cThey are going to use us in the same terrain someday. In a place with such a large army, of course, there is a high probability that it is a manor of a large clan in Jianghu or a very influential person.\u201dThe red light in Pyo-wol\u2019s eyes grew even worse. Thinking up to this point, the question of why he had kidnapped himself and his children was resolved.\u201cWe are tools that will be used once and thrown away, so that\u2019s why they\u2019re treating us so harshly. What they need is a usable tool, not a human who can think. In order to prevent a person from thinking and to forge them into the tools they want, no matter the nature of the person, when they are exposed to such an environment, they cannot think properly.\u201dWhat\u2019s more, the people here were young and their identity had not yet been established. If they stay in this environment for a long time, there is a high probability that they will gradually stop thinking.Children who do not have troublesome thoughts and would follow whatever orders they have.\u00a0Everyone would turn out to be ferocious and fearless. Since they\u2019ve already experience killing in this underground cave, there would be no hesitation in taking another person\u2019s life.\u00a0There is nothing more suitable as a tool.Pyo-wol stood up and muttered.\u201cThey\u2019re going to turn us into assassins.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The group she led was also drunk with the afterglow of victory.But not everyone was like that.Some children were shuddering with a terrible sense of guilt. Lee Min was one of them. She also killed another child today. She had blood on her small white hands.She didn\u2019t know how many times she had already washed her hands. But the smell of blood did not disappear and seemed to follow her.\u201cHah\u2026\u201dLee Min sighed softly.Her eyes were red and bloodshot, perhaps because she had been forcing herself to cry.\u201cKeke! Did you see that guy? You know the guy who I strangled to death? He looked like a crucian carp when he gulped his last breath! \u201c\u201cIt was really exciting!\u201d\u201cOur leader is truly the best.\u201dThe children ate the food they had stolen from the Go Yeongsan group and talked about their experiences. As if it was the most natural thing, like eating with food on their hands.They had become accustomed to blood. Just like it\u2019s their natural inclination.\u00a0It was terribly disgusting.No, the truly disgusting thing was being with them. Without knowing it, Lee Min was already fed up.\u00a0Clang!\u00a0Suddenly, a dull noise resounded from the underground ceiling.\u201cWhat? Is it time for food to come down already?\u201d\u201cThere should be another half day.\u201dThe children looked at the ceiling with suspicious eyes. A huge basket was coming down. The children jumped to their feet expecting that the food was coming down.So Yeowol said to the children.\u201cYou have to secure as much food as possible.\u201d\u201cYes boss!.\u201d\u201cWill do!\u201dSo Yeowol\u2019s group responded with equal momentum. As soon as the Go Yeongsan group disappeared, there was no group left to oppose them. Of course, some groups are still alive, but they wouldn\u2019t dare compare and compete against So Yeowol\u2019s group.\u00a0So Yeowol looked around the area with sharp eyes. Her eyes were searching for Pyo-wol. Pyo-wol was the only person So Yeowol felt uncomfortable confronting inside the underground cavity.Pyo-wol was different from other children in many ways.He wasn\u2019t leading a group like himself, and he wasn\u2019t engaging in conspicuous activities. He only takes his share of food, but So Yeowol was strangely vigilant around him.If she wanted to, she could mobilize all her members to attack him. But the reason she didn\u2019t do so was because of Pyo-wol\u2019s eyes.Pyo-wol\u2019s eyes, with a tinge of red, were strangely deep, and she couldn\u2019t guess what\u2019s on his mind.\u00a0 Although they were living in the same space and time, she wasn\u2019t the only one who felt this way.\u00a0Even the people following her were reluctant to take an action against Pwo-wol.\u00a0They were all afraid.In particular, after killing a group of Yeom Iljung alone, the fear of Pyo-wol became increased. Not only So Yeo-wol, but most of the children in the underground cave had the same sentiment.\u00a0At some point, So Yeowol\u2019s eyes lit up. Because she found Pyo-wol among the children. However, the expression on Pyo-wol\u2019s expression was somehow strange.His expression stiffened as if he was on guard against something.\u201cWhy does he look like th\u2013\u2026\u201dSo Yeowol unknowingly looked at the basket instead of asking Pyo-wol. Because Pyo-wol\u2019s gaze was fixated on the basket.It was then.Suddenly people came out of the basket.They were all adults wearing masks.Instead of food, they were the ones who came down to the underground cave inside baskets. Each of them had a metal bats in their hand.\u201cW-What?\u201d\u201cWho are you?!\u201dThe moment the children screamed in surprise, the masked people riding in the baskets began to engage in merciless violence.\u201cKAGH!\u201d\u201cW-wwhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cKyaak\u2013\u201dThe iron rods of the masked men hit the children.The children were left helpless with their assault. A few hard-headed children rushed forward, but they were not opponents they could go against in the first place. The children were far too weak to deal with the grown-up adults, more so against fighters who were trained in martial arts.Perk! Puck!The sound of flesh exploding resounded everywhere. No matter how poisonous they were, children were just buds that had not yet matured. Such sprouts were being trampled by the clubs of the masked men.The masked men were merciless. They continued the brutal assault without saying anything.So Yeowol was no exception. She had to endure the assaults of masked men with her body bent like a shrimp. It was the same with Pyo-wol.\u00a0Pyo-wol was beaten without any resistance. He had anticipated this. He could have escaped into the darkness of the underground area if he had made up his mind, but he didn\u2019t.If he were to do that, there was a high probability that he would unnecessarily attract their attention. Don\u2019t stand out or else his efforts will turn out for nothing. He\u2019d just become a person who would be used as a consumable much sooner if he caught their attention.\u00a0That was the reason why Pyo-wol did not resist and was beaten like other children.Pyo-wol looked at the basket, bending over and protecting his head with both hands. The gigantic basket once again went up to the ceiling and came down with new people.They were wearing masks like the masked people who are now assaulting,The moment he saw them, goosebumps ran all over Pyo-wol\u2019s body.\u2018They are the real masterminds!\u2019There were three of them, and they had an atmosphere that was so intimidating that it could not be compared with the masked men wielding iron clubs. On their masks, the characters one (\u4e00), two (\u4e8c), and three (\u4e09) were written.They looked around the hall with sharp eyes.Not one child remained standing in the hall. All of them were on the floor collapsed due to the overwhelming violence.Neither So Yeowol\u2019s leadership, the children\u2019s poison, nor the murder experience worked against the masked people who had overwhelming power.\u2018They were being tamed like this.\u2019Pyo-wol trembled slightly at their cruel heart. Even animals are not tamed in this way. At least if they consider themselves as humans, they wouldn\u2019t treat people like consumables.\u00a0They did not think of children as human beings.Just like Pyo-Wol thought, they were being treated like a tool.In order to raise them the way they wanted, it was necessary to kill their spirit. Hence the need for violence.\u00a0The masked man with the number one (\u4e00) written on his face raised his hand. The violence immediately ceased.\u00a0The masked men gathered their clubs and stood behind the three masked men.The masked man with the number one (\u4e00) on it opened his mouth.\u201cI am called First Sword (\u4e00\u525c). From now on, I will manage this place. Your life will be mine from now on. There are no exceptions.\u201d\u201cUgh! Who are you?One of the children shook his head.He was the leader of a small group. His character was also commendable.\u00a0Thud!But he couldn\u2019t finish his speech.As soon as he opened his mouth, a masked man nearby hit him on the neck.The boy\u2019s head was rolling as he opened his mouth. It was a great shock to the children to see a human head rolling like that.\u201cI never gave you permission to open your mouth.\u201dAt the indifferent words of the First Sword, the children held back the screams that were about to come out.\u00a0The children had a gut feeling that a new hell had opened.* * *The number of remaining children was forty-nine.\u00a0The original number of children which was over three hundred has been reduced to almost one-sixth.\u00a0Two hundred people died of starvation or suicide because they could not endure despair, and the remaining fifty people died in the end because of the food war.In the midst of this, the children who survived to the end were poisonous among poisonous species.Although they bowed their heads at the merciless violence of the masked people and looked as if they were frightened, the eyes of the children were completely different.\u2018These bastards will die by my hands someday.\u2019\u2018I will kill them.\u2019\u2018Just you wait\u2026\u2019The children\u2019s eyes were full of poison.They still lacked strength so they have no choice but to endure for now, but their hatred and anger towards the masked people did not diminish at all. Even the masked people were aware of\u00a0 that fact.Because it was them who raised those children that way.\u201cThey are Cursed Poison (\u8831\u6bd2 Kudoku).\u201dFirst sword murmured.If several poisonous insects are mixed in a jar, they will eat and kill each other until only one survives. The last one remaining insect that survives after eating the other poisons would emerge as\u00a0 one with the most venomous poison.That was Cursed Poison.\u00a0The one with the strongest survival instinct among many poisons. A monster possessing the most venomous poison.\u201cAmong the countless children, only the most wicked and the ones with the strongest survival instincts have survived. Just as we wanted.\u201dRaising those children as tools is not a concern. They were full of poison. They will not be discouraged by any ordeal or training.\u00a0The question was whether they could control the children as they\u00a0 wanted.Even so, the anti-skeletal temperament was abundant. (\uadf8\ub807\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc544\ub3c4 \ubc18\uace8 \uae30\uc9c8\uc774 \ub2e4\ubd84\ud588\ub2e4.)If they can\u2019t exert control over the children, there is a high probability that they will become a double-edged sword. Even the enemy can harm the one holding the sharp sword. The one sword\u2019s gaze turned to the other sword. (\uc801\uc5d0\uac8c\ub3c4 \ub0a0\uce74\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac80\uc740 \uc950\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uc790\ub97c \ud574\uce60 \uc218\ub3c4 \uc788\ub294 \ubc95\uc774\ub2e4. \uc77c\uac80\uc758 \uc2dc\uc120\uc774 \uc774\uac80\uc744 \ud5a5\ud588\ub2e4.)He asked in a low voice that children couldn\u2019t hear.\u201cWhich of them is worth paying attention to?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s So Yeowol as you\u2019d expect. As she leads the largest group, she has a great influence on children.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cIf we don\u2019t break her spirit now, she will be much harder to deal with in the future.\u201d\u201cGrant her special attention, so she wouldn\u2019t even dream of starting a rebellion.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d\u201cWho else is there?\u201d\u201cSong Cheonwoo and Kang Il are also noteworthy. Although they are overshadowed by So Yeowol, they are the most outstanding in terms of their sense towards martial arts.\u201dThe masked men were clearly aware of what had happened in the underground cavity.Unbeknownst to the children, there were several monitoring equipment throughout the underground cavity that could observe everything that was happening inside.\u00a0Through the equipment, the masked people were aware of all the internal affairs.\u00a0This underground cave was not made by them. It was a secret facility built a long time ago by a certain clan full of mages.The masked people just accidentally discovered the place and ended up recycling its facilities. All the kernels disappeared and only the shell remained, but that alone was enough for the masked people.Except for the masked people, no one knew about this place. It was the perfect facility to avoid the eyes of the world and do something. The best thing is that it didn\u2019t take a lot of money to run the place.\u00a0Hence also the reason why they chose this place.A place where they can cultivate Cursed Poison will become their weapon.First sword asked as if he had suddenly remembered.\u201cHow\u2019s that guy?\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d\u201cThe lone survivor of sector one.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s Pyo-wol then he\u2019s still alive.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dFirst sword murmured as he touched his chin with his hand.They managed each of the ten underground sections separately. They tested each child\u2019s ability to survive in different environments. Among them, the conditions in the area where Pyo-wol was confined was the most severe. They also provided the least amount of food.Pyo-wol survived in such a harsh environment that even the masked himself was not sure that he himself could guarantee his survival.His survival was enough to attract the attention of masked people in many ways.\u201cKeep an eye on him. He\u2019s not a normal guy.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201d\u201cThere are only six years left. We must complete the quest within that duration.\u201d\u201cGiven that only the poisonous and strongest who will survive, six years will be enough.\u201dAfter the First Sword became silent for a moment, the other sword quietly went out.\u00a0First sword, who was now left alone, muttered as he pulled out a finely folded piece of paper from his bosom.\u201cWhy did the captain accept a request like this\u2026?\u201dHe unfolded the paper.\u00a0[Privy only to the Blood Phantom Group Captain.\u00a0\u2026Requesting the assassination of.Duration: Seven years.Reward: 500,000 gold.Condition: To not leave a single trace related to the Blood Phantom Group.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You must learn this within that time. After three months I\u2019ll check your progress and if you still haven\u2019t mastered it, I\u2019ll cut your throat off with my own hands.\u201dThe children did not answer.Because they were commanded to remain silent in any case.The three swords looked around the children with cool eyes and said.The Thunder-Splitting Cultivation Technique is a cultivation\u00a0 method that the corps obtained with much difficulty. The main characteristic of this method is that it is easy to learn. No matter how dull you are, if you use it consistently for a year, you can feel qi and build up your internal energy. So it\u2019s perfect for a beginner like you. A person who has achieved outstanding achievements in Thunder-Splitting Cultivation Technique will be given an even better mind method, so it would be better to work hard.\u201dThe children\u2019s eyes lit up.The more you get a better mental method, the more likely you are to become stronger. The children listened to the words of the Three Swords, knowing that the stronger they became, the higher their chances of surviving.The Third Sword explained to the children how to operate the Thunder-Splitting Cultivation Technique in an easy-to-understand manner.The biggest feature of Thunder-Splitting Cultivation Technique is that it is easy to learn, just like the three swords mentioned a while ago. Even if one did not read the booklet containing the method of cultivation but knew the overall gist, a person could already execute it immediately.The children listened to the explanation of the three swords.The Third Sword explained it in detail so that children could easily understand it.More than half of the children did not know how to read. They couldn\u2019t even read the booklet after it was handed out to them so they didn\u2019t pay it any attention at all and just focused on the voice of the Three Sword.Thunder-Splitting Cultivation Technique was a fearsome weapon that a soldier who had been assassinated by the Blood Phantom Group.\u00a0The warrior himself assassinated by the Blood Phantom Group was only a second-rate martial artist, but the method of cultivation he possessed was exceptional. The uninhabited man also obtained the method of cultivation by chance, so even he did not know its origin.The reason why the Blood Phantom Group left the cultivation method unattended even after acquiring the Thunder-Splitting Cultivation Technique is because it was judged that this method is only suitable as an introductory method for those who do not know any martial arts techniques at all.The Blood Phantom Corps will not accept those who have not mastered any skill. To become accepted as a member of the group, they have to be verified to possess a certain level of skill so they did not feel the need to learn the Thunder-Splitting Cultivation Technique, which is a method for beginners. Hence why it has been neglected until now.Complex methods could not be used to make children a tool to use in the next six years. The idea is to create a foundation using the simplest method as possible to let them acquire the necessary skills fast.\u00a0Learning skills quickly is possible, but instead the path to ascension (\u5e38\u52dd) was blocked.There are many sects and warriors in Jianghu, but there are not many clans who possess the deep cultivation method that can reach the mystery of ascension.\u00a0It is because it deserves to be called a prestigious political faction of a strong man just because he has a mental method that embraces the mystery of ascension. (\uc0c1\uc2b9\uc758 \ubb18\ub9ac\ub97c \ud488\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uc2ec\ubc95\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub3c4 \uac15\ud638\uc758 \uba85\ubb38\uc815\ud30c\ub77c \ubd88\ub9b4 \ub9cc\ud558\uae30\ub54c\ubb38\uc774\ub2e4.)Even within the Blood Phantom Corps, there were only a few who had learned the technique of ascending.\u00a0It was all about the Blood Phantom Corps\u2019 Captain and the Seven Ghost Swords.\u00a0(\ud608\uc601\ub2e8\uc758 \ub2e8\uc8fc\uc640 \uadc0\ud63c\uce60\uac80(\u9b3c\u9b42\u4e03\u5263) \uc815\ub3c4\uac00 \uc804\ubd80\uc600\ub2e4.)Even that was only possible because the Blood Phantom Corps had been active for a long time and obtained quite a number of strange books (\u5947\u66f8 kisho).\u00a0First Sword, Second Sword, and Third Sword were all members of the Seven Ghost Swords.\u00a0However, they were old enough to retire from the front line. The Blood Phantom Group Captain had ordered them to train the new batch of assassins.While the children were fighting in the underground cavity, the three swords studied the method of cultivation. This is so they can pass on the method to children and to smoothly move on to the next step.\u00a0The Third Sword explained to the children the details of the Thunder-Splitting Cultivation Technique that he had studied so far.The children were fascinated by his words.\u201c\u2026Okay, that is all. If you have any questions, read the booklet and study it on your own.\u201d\u00a0The Third Sword forced the children to sit cross-legged, and then to breathe according to the Thunder-Splitting Cultivation Technique. The masked men surrounded the children and watched to see if they were doing as instructed.\u00a0The masked men were also assassins, acting as custodians and guards. No matter how simple the method was, there was no one who could execute it properly from the beginning.Not to mention, none of the children here had learned martial arts outside.No, there were a significant number of children who didn\u2019t even know that cultivation even existed.It was impossible for such children to feel the inner workings from the beginning. Still, as the three swords taught, the children tried to breathe and feel qi.\u00a0Pyo-wol was one of them.He frowned heavily and breathed as the three swords had told him.Inner Qi or internal energy (Naegong) is not created by practicing cultivation for just a day or two.The human body is at its purest right after it comes out of the mother\u2019s womb. If you utilize the breathing method at this time, you will be able to get a tremendous amount of internal energy.\u00a0Because it is impossible to do so, the prestigious clan sects instead performs a practice of cleansing the bone marrow and cutting their hair (\u4e8c\u4f10\u6bdb\u6d17\u862d\u00a0 f\u00e1 m\u00e1o x\u01d0 su\u01d0) to put the children\u2019s bodies in an optimal state for building internal energy.The achievements of children who have been subjected to bone marrow cleansing are unmatched by those who do not.That was the difference between those coming from prestigious sects and the not-so-famous ones.Differences in birth have created a gap that is difficult to overcome.The fortunate thing is that bone marrow cleansing is not something that everyone can achieve and that only a few selected people in the whole of the stronghold of Jianghu are blessed.If Pyo-wol and the children had undergone bone marrow cleansing, they would have felt and accumulated inner qi at once, but it was impossible in the first place.First of all, they had to create a state of the body where they could feel the inner air.They had to nurture a field in which seeds called qi (\u6c23) could gather by stroking the dantian (\u4e39\u7530) with their breath.The breathing method, which they are now practicing, was the very first process. The process of cultivating a field is tedious and laborious, because it is impossible to know when the seeds of qi will germinate.Those who have developed a sense of qi can feel it completely in a month or two, but those without talent wouldn\u2019t be able to feel the presence of inner qi at all, even after years of learning.Now they\u2019re in the process of cultivating the dantian that could contain ki.The three swords watched with sharp eyes to see if the children were using the Thunder-Splitting Cultivation Technique properly.Fortunately, all of the children were immersed in the Thunder-Splitting Cultivation Technique.\u00a0The three swords said to the custodians.\u00a0\u201cIf there is a guy who is fooling around or has other thoughts, kill him immediately.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe custodians responded in unison.Their eyes as they looked at the children were full of life.Although they are serving as custodians because of the orders of the Blood Phantom Group Captain, their main occupation was actually being an assassin.\u201dA person who kills others for money.With no cause or belief.\u00a0To them, money was their belief and cause.Even though they were promised to be paid a decent price, there was no way they could be happy nurturing young children in such a dark place, when they can be strolling outside.Because of that, their faces were full of poison.The thought that they would not let it go if even one small twig was caught was revealed on their face. Under their bloody surveillance, the children were forced to immerse themselves in the Thunder-Splitting Cultivation Technique.The custodians pushed the children harshly.They split the day in half doing two things, except for sleeping, in the morning they spend the time learning how to do the Thunder-Splitting Cultivation Technique, and in the afternoon they train their physical strength.The custodians made the children run nonstop.\u201cThe final battle over there is your goal. I will give the person who arrives the earliest to take a break. Conversely, I will let the person who arrives last know what hell is.\u201dAt the words of the three swords, the children all started running in unison.There was no time to think.When it was time to roll their heads, they had to run toward the target at least one step faster than the other children.\u201cUaah!\u201d\u201cDamn it!\u201dShouts erupted from the children\u2019s mouths.They ran with all their might.The terrain where the children were was clearly visible.Some children jumped over the fence, while others tried to shorten the distance by using a hole they had identified in advance.However, the children\u2019s attempts were in vain.This is because the custodians attacked from unexpected places.\u00a0Pak!\u201cKUAGH!\u201dA wooden sword struck his leg.The beaten child fell to the floor screaming. The child screamed like he was going to die, but the expression on the custodian\u2019s face remained cool.\u201cWho told you to scream at will? If you don\u2019t shut up right away, I\u2019ll pick you up.\u201d\u201cHiiik!\u201dAt the threat of the custodian the child covered his mouth with both hands, got up and started running again.The same thing happened all over the place.The custodians were secretly hiding and attacked the children running in front of them.The children\u2019s eyes were several times more sensitive than they were before they came in, but they can\u2019t detect assassins who have trained professionally for a long time.They can\u2019t.\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s not just about getting to the battlefield quickly. Its true purpose is to detect the location of the hidden custodian and secure a safe infiltration route.\u201dPyo-wol realized the true purpose of this training.He slowed down a bit.Unlike the other children, he adapted perfectly to the dark. The assassins\u2019 hiding was of no use to him, who could see the night as day like an owl.If he wanted to, he could reach his destination in the shortest time by using the only infiltration route where the assassins were not hiding, but Pyo-wol did not.He deliberately passed near where the assassin was hiding.As if waiting, the custodian attacked him.Pak!\u00a0\u201cKugh!\u201dPyo-wol bent over like a shrimp after being hit in the back by the surprise attack by the custodian.The chilly voice of the surprised bridgehead poured down the back of his head.\u201cIf you move poorly like what you did just now, you won\u2019t survive until the end. Hurry up and run.\u201d\u201cUgh! Yes!\u201dPyo-wol struggled to endure the pain and ran again.The custodian looked at Pyo-wol\u2019s back with a contemptuous gaze and then hid again.First and Two Swords watched the training of such children from the highest point of the fortress.Most of the children were beaten by the custodians, but some were not.Instead of running blindly like other children, they ran away from where the bridgeheads might be hiding.The sword opened his mouth.\u201cAs expected, So Yeowol is the best.\u201d\u201cHer intelligence is outstanding. Judgment, courage, and execution are all top-notch.\u201dFirst Sword nodded at the supplementary explanation of the other sword.So Yeowol was the person who stood out the most so far. She overcame the physical disadvantage of being a woman and arrived at her destination at the fastest speed.So Yeowol was never attacked by the custodians.Following her, Song Cheonwoo and several children arrived.They, too, were commended.\u201cWhat about the Pyo-wol?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s mediocre. Right now, he\u2019s not particularly prominent.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 Was I mistaken?\u201dA light of disappointment passed through the sword\u2019s eyes.He had high expectations because Pyo-wol was the only survivor in the area, but he was disappointed that Pyo-wol couldn\u2019t stand out in the first training.But he didn\u2019t completely let go of his regrets.\u201cStill, we don\u2019t know, so let\u2019s wait and see.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201d* * *All the children were exhausted from the continuous forced march.As soon as the day was over, the children started falling asleep.It was the same with So Yeowol, who stands out by far.Although her qualities were superior to anyone else, her physical strength was clearly inferior to that of boys, so she had to struggle most of the time. However, even when she was exhausted, she showed that she took care of the children who followed her.\u00a0Because of that, the children\u2019s trust in her had further strengthened.On the other hand, Pyo-wol always maintained only moderate grades.Average grades that are neither too outstanding nor too lacking.\u00a0Because of that, the interest that had been focused on him from the beginning had long since disappeared. A lot of people think he survived in sector one through luck.\u00a0This was what Pyo-wol wanted.In his hand, he held the Thunder-Splitting Cultivation Technique booklet.\u00a0At first, there were children who read the booklet because they did not understand the Thunder-Splitting Cultivation Technique. However, when the method of cultivation became familiar to them at some extent, they stopped reading the booklet.Even the custodians didn\u2019t force the children to read the booklet of the Thunder-Splitting Cultivation Technique.\u00a0The method was nothing more than an introductory mind method to move on to the next stage anyway.Thanks to this, Pyo-wol was able to monopolize the original copy of the Thunder-Splitting Cultivation Technique.Everyone thought of the Thunder-Splitting Cultivation Technique as a passing stepping stone, but Pyo-Wol had a different idea.Some time ago, something was sprouting in his dantian.\u00a0 The tickling thing gradually increased in size each time Pyo-Wol used the Thunder-Splitting Cultivation Technique.Pyo-wol thought it was a qi (\u6c23).The other children didn\u2019t seem to feel qi yet.Even So Yeowol, who is the most highly regarded of the custodians,\u00a0 did not feel the internal energy and was confused.On the other hand, Pyo-wol clearly felt the energy.\u00a0That was the reason why Pyo-wol brought the original Thunder-Splitting Cultivation Technique.Pyo-wol thought that maybe he was more sensitive to qi than the other children, or maybe he had a particularly good compatibility with the Thunder-Splitting Cultivation TechniqueThere was only one way to confirm his conjecture.It is directly checking the original copy of the Thunder-Splitting Cultivation Technique So, he dared to bring the original copy of the Thunder-Splitting Cultivation TechniquePyo-wol sat cross-legged and began to read the Thunder-Splitting Cultivation Technique.Learning to write was the only legacy of his deceased father.Palag! Palag!In the darkness, only the sound of the paper flipping resounded.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 11": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 11Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTime passed quickly even in the dark.The children quickly adapted to their training routine.\u00a0Now most kids have noticed the real intention behind their running practice.The children tried to find out in advance where the custodians were hiding by spreading their senses as wide as possible.Of course, not all were successful, but So Yeowol and a few children did stand out and succeed. And finally, they succeeded in building internal qi through the method of cultivation\u00a0As they start to feel qi, their senses become more sensitive. Thanks to this, they were able to excel better during training.As the number of children who felt the qi increased, the custodians threw them a second cultivation book.It was a book called the Poisonous Dragon Heart Method (\u200b\u200b\u6bd2\u9f8d\u5fc3\u6cd5).The Poisonous Dragon Heart Method was a mind cultivation method that could build up inner energy as an attribute. The path to ascension is blocked, but in exchange, it is possible to build up inner strength at a high speed up to a certain line. The efficiency was significantly higher than doing other methods.It has great destructive power like a dragon with a lot of poison, but since the security is poor, if someone makes a mistake, there is a high possibility that they will get burned.But the custodians did not tell the children anything about it. They just threw out the booklet and forced them to open and learn it.The children learned the Poisonous Dragon Heart Method without thinking much about.\u00a0Now the children were addicted to gaining strength.\u00a0As they continued to master cultivation skills, their overall body ability increased dramatically together with their confidence. The children were hell bent on becoming stronger as if they were on drugs.Madness dominates the mind of the children.Those who achieved outstanding achievements were rewarded accordingly.They were given abundant food and good weapons.These two encouraged children\u2019s competitive spirit and resulted in rapid growth.Pyo-wol looked at the booklet of the Poisonous Dragon Heart Method with a calm gaze.There were no children who tried to look and read the Poisonous Dragon Heart Method, quite similar in the case of the Thunder-Splitting Cultivation Technique. This was because the three swords have already explained the cultivation method in detail.Because of this, Pyo-wol was able to easily obtain the original copy of the Poisonous Dragon Heart Method.Pyo-wol compared the Poisonous Dragon Heart Method with the Thunder-Splitting Cultivation Technique. The latter method is one that he had read dozens of times already. Thanks to his actions, the booklet has long been in tatters.Probably, Pyo-wol read the Thunder-Splitting Cultivation Technique many times more than the three swords, who originally introduced and taught the technique.\u00a0Pyo-wol came to one conclusion after reading the Splitting the Mind Method dozens of times.\u2018They didn\u2019t fully comprehend this cultivation technique.\u2019If we compare it to a tree, the Thunder-Splitting Cultivation Technique was a huge tree with very thick branches. However, the three swords and the custodians cut off all the branches, leaving only the core trunk and roots.Because they thought that was enough.Actually it was.Most of the children were able to learn the inner skills through the method of cultivating, using only the core.It was enough to supplement the branching part with the Poisonous Dragon Heart Method.That one was much more efficient.The children here are not the ones who would lead the future as powerhouses like those coming from prestigious clans.\u00a0They were just a knife that was raised to fulfill a single quest.They wanted a sharp knife that could leave a fatal wound even once, rather than a strong knife that would never break. And the children have steadily grown up as the Blood Phantom Corps wanted.The children who learned the Poisonous Dragon Heart Method grew quickly. And by a large margin as compared to the children.On the other hand, the achievement of Pyo-wol, who first felt the qi, was slow.It\u2019s because he hasn\u2019t tried to learn the Poisonous Dragon Heart Method yet.The suspicion that arose from the depths of his heart prevented him from learning the method of the Poisonous Dragon Heart Method. Given his reluctance, Pyo-wol postponed learning the method of the\u00a0 Poisonous Dragon Heart Method and instead immersed himself in analyzing the method of the Poisonous Dragon Heart Method.The essence of the cultivation method is in its heart. (\u2018\ubd84\ub8b0\uc2ec\ubc95\uc758 \uc694\uccb4\ub294 \uc2ec\uc18d(\u5fc3\u901f)\uc774\uc57c.\u2019)Everything is contained in the name of the Thunder-Splitting Cultivation Technique.\u00a0Lightning strikes from the sky to the earth at a speed that humans cannot perceive. The sight that human beings see is only the finished form after the lightning has penetrated the heavens and the earth, but they could not see the process.He had to split the lightning (\u5206\u96f7).\u00a0It was impossible to break through lightning with human power. It was the same no matter how stubborn the warrior was. Nevertheless, the person who invented the cultivation technique dared to choose the word thunder splitting.\u00a0Pyo-wol thought that there was no reason to choose such a word.Every word has its own meaning.In particular, the gugyeol was added.1\u00a0(\ud2b9\ud788 \ubb34\uacf5 \uad6c\uacb0\uc740 \ub354\ud588\ub2e4.)Depending on how one interprets the gugyeol, the power and achievement differed from heaven to earth.Pyo-wol thought that power meant the mind.It was impossible with the power of the body, but it was possible with the mind.Usually people think that such a thing is a delusion, but Pyo-wol did not think that the author who created the Thunder-Splitting Cultivation Technique was a dreamer.With only the key point of cutting all branches, the children were able to quickly recognize the qi and build strength. The person who made such a great martial art couldn\u2019t have been a dreamer.After much deliberation, Pyo-wol thought that splitting thunder is not meant to be taken literally. Since it\u2019s physically impossible to split thunder, it may be referring to the speed of thought.\u00a0If you can think quickly enough to rival the speed of lightning, you may be able to do many things that are not possible with common sense.The question was whether Pyo-wol, who did not know the martial arts, could perfectly master the essence of such a method.Rather, moving on to the Poisonous Dragon Heart Method now would be easier and quicker to achieve.\u00a0It was obvious that the road would be much easier and convenient if the swords or the custodians had already decided on how to lay their foundation.\u00a0However, what Pyo-wol is worried about is that if he follows and walks the way that others have laid down, he also wouldn\u2019t be able to escape the limits that they have set.Pyo-wol will never be satisfied with that.\u00a0After he passed the crisis of life and death alone in the dark darkness, Pyo-wol had a coming-of-age that no one else had.Maybe he didn\u2019t know that his well-hidden rebellious tendency was starting to wake up.He did not want to be ruled by others.He didn\u2019t want to surrender to the humans who put him in this dark space.So in order to do that, he had to get off the road they had made. Instead of a safe and flat road, Pyo-wol chose a bumpy and rough road with unexpected dangers.Pyo-wol put the booklet of the Poisonous Dragon Heart Method\u00a0 away.* * *Now the children were accustomed to their training of running.\u00a0The practice of running made their bodies and stamina stronger than ever before.\u00a0They have strong muscles like wild goats. The combination of an excellent body and the Poisonous Dragon Heart method made their talents bloom.The growth speed of the children was beyond the expectations of both the First and Second Sword.\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re growing faster than I thought.\u201d\u201cIf this is the case, I think five years is enough instead of six. In fact, the time period of six years was chosen not because the target is that strong, but to erase traces as much as possible and achieve perfection.\u201d\u201cYou cannot underestimate the target. He possesses the most talent in all of Sichuan Province.\u201dTo deal with such a talent, perfect preparation is not enough, because if we make any sort of mistake, then entire Blood Phantom Group may be annihilated. Isn\u2019t that why the Captain recruits and trains these children who have nothing to do with the Blood Phantom Corps? Even if they fail, there will be no problem.\u201dThat\u2019s also the reason why they never take off their masks. They cannot show their faces to children to hide their identity.\u00a0The sword apologized.\u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mean to underestimate the target.\u201d\u201cI know. Still, you must be fully alert.\u201d\u201cYes, sir!\u201dThe Second Sword replied vigorously.The First sword looked at the Second Sword for a moment without saying a word.\u201cNow, let\u2019s teach the children assasination techniques (\u6bba\u6cd5).2\u201c\u201cAlright.\u201dThe Second sword answered immediately.Assassins are never made overnight.The method of killing will also vary depending on the opponent\u2019s status, military power, and situation, so one needs to learn as many techniques as possible.\u00a0There seemed to be a mountain of things to learn, from techniques that can actually kill such as through swordsmanship or poison arts, to techniques related to infiltration, such as stealth, and secret techniques.\u00a0(\uac80\ubc95, \ub3c4\ubc95, \ub3c5\uc220, \uc554\uae30\uc220\ucc98\ub7fc \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc228\ud1b5\uc744 \ub04a\ub294 \uc218\ubc95\ubd80\ud130 \uc740\uc2e0\uc220\uacfc \uadc0\uc2dd\ub300\ubc95, \uc554\ud589\uc220 \uac19\uc740 \uce68\ud22c\uc5d0 \uc5f0\uad00\ub41c \uc218\ubc95\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc775\ud600\uc57c \ud560 \uac83\uc774 \uc0b0\ub354\ubbf8 \uac19\uc558\ub2e4.)The Second Sword said that five years would be enough, but First Sword thought that six years was actually not enough.\u00a0\u201cPush the children even more.\u201d\u201cA lot of them will die.\u201d\u201cBut the ones to survive will become even stronger.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dThe First sword delivered the command of the one sword to the custodians.\u00a0 The custodians immediately carried out their orders.\u201cI will teach you the sword starting today.\u201dThe assassin\u2019s sword is a killing\u00a0 sword.They do not pursue virtuous swordsmanship like a taoist or unaffiliated do. (\uadf8\ub4e4\uc740 \ud654\uc0b0\ud30c\ub098 \ubb34\ub2f9\ud30c\ucc98\ub7fc \uac80\uc220\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc120\ub3c4(\u4ed9\u9053)\ub97c \ucd94\uad6c\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4.)They focus on only stopping a person\u2019s breath in the shortest time with the least amount of effort.For that reason, the assassin\u2019s sword is simple yet effective.The road to ascension is blocked, but it\u2019s enough to quickly cut off a person\u2019s breath that no other person can follow.\u00a0To do this, one has to be familiar with the human body.Because of that, the assassins were just as knowledgeable about the human body as physicians. Because they only focus on studying how to kill people every day.\u201cNo matter how hard you try, if you get hit in these three places, you can\u2019t avoid death. Those are the head, neck, and heart. If you get stabbed in these three places, no matter how high your defense is, it\u2019s useless. It\u2019s an intensive attack on the enemy. It\u2019s called the Snake Soul Sword (\u86c7\u9b42\u5263). It\u2019s a one-hit deadly technique that cuts the opponent\u2019s breath at once, just like how a snake snatches its prey at once.\u201d\u201cYou mean there\u2019s no second attack if it\u2019s a one-hit special?\u201dIt was Pyo-wol who asked the question without fear.For a moment, the Second Sword looked at Pyo-Wol with numb eyes. His eyes were so cold that it gave me goosebumps.The children trembled, even though they couldn\u2019t even see their eyes.The Second Sword said.\u201cThere are no second chances for an assassin. If you can\u2019t get your opponent down on the first hit, then you already lost. So it\u2019s better not to think about a second attack.\u201dThe Second Sword brought up the word assassin for the first time.Many of the children already realized that they were being raised as assassins and started chattering. But after a moment, when they felt the cold gaze of the three swords, they quickly shut his mouth.The custodian formed the children into two pairs, and threw them each a dagger.It was a real sword that was forged with a dark blue blade.Pyo-wol is paired with a child named Gok Soo-chang.Gok Soo-chang was a short boy with numerous acne marks on his face. He looked ugly, but his eyes were full of poison.He said abruptly.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cFor what?\u201d\u201cFor everything.\u201dPyo-wol frowned at Gok Soo-chang\u2019s words. Then the voice of the custodian was heard.\u201cWe\u2019ll start with the neck first.\u201dThe children aimed their sword towards the opponent\u2019s neck, as the custodian instructed. They used a dagger that was much shorter than a normal sword and pretended to stab through the opponent\u2019s neck.Not so long ago, they had been hell-bent on killing each other, but after the appearance of the custodians, the children immediately stopped fighting.They tacitly agreed to a truce when a powerful external enemy emerged.Because of that, the swords that were swung towards each other did not contain as much energy. Of course, if the circumstances change in the future, then the day will come when they will truly wield the sword, but for now, there was no reason to harbor murderous intent towards each other.The children repeated several times in order to get used to the swordsmanship taught by the custodians.They were children who had already slain others with their bare hands, even if no one taught them. As soon as they put the forged weapon in the hands of such children, they quickly got used to it.The children used the sword skillfully as if they had learned the sword from a young age.Swish!\u00a0The sound of children swinging daggers echoed in the underground cave.\u00a0The custodians only gave them a sword, but did not correct the posture nor give any detailed instructions.It was as if they had finished their work just by telling them about the swordsmanship.Indeed it was.They were children who had already tasted blood through a hellish situation. There was no need to give detailed instructions to those who are full of madness. Just by opening the door slightly, they instinctively found the way they should go.The children\u2019s sword grew sharper and sharper.\u201cKikiki!\u201dIt was the same with Gok Soo-chang. He swung his dagger freely against Pyo-wol.Schwing!It was as if he had been learning swordsmanship for a long time, he stabbed like an island war and receded like the wind.Pyo-wol also responded accordingly.It was time for him to pretend to stab a sword in the throat of his opponent and retreat.But Gok Soo-chang\u2019s eyes suddenly changed.Although one could not notice any change on the surface, Pyo-wol\u2019s senses did not miss his subtle changes.\u2018Hm?\u2019Whoosh!At that moment, the dagger of Gok Soo-chang flew at a speed that could not be compared with before. His dagger was aimed precisely at Pyo-wol\u2019s throat.It wasn\u2019t just a feint stabs like before, but he was actually starting to attack with murderous intent.Pyo-wol almost instinctively tilted his head back and swung his dagger.Chae-ang!Pyo-wol\u2019s sword deflected Gok Soo-chang\u2019s sword. The fight would normally have stopped at this point. But Gok Soo-chang rushed at Pyo-wol like a demon.\u00a0The murderous intent he harbored was real.He really wants to kill Pyo-wol.Even the custodian who was watching from nearby knew that fact. But the custodian did not stop the actions of Gok Soo-chang.\u00a0Rather, he looked at them with interest.\u00a0Pyo-wol avoided his dagger and opened his mouth.\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d\u201cHiiih! It\u2019s not fun to have a fake fight, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYou should go all out too. Otherwise, you will be eaten! Kihihi!\u201dWith a smile full of madness, Gok Soo-chang dug into Pyo-wol\u2019s arms. In a moment of crisis, Pyo-wol threw away his dagger. Because it felt clunky.Thunk!\u00a0Pyo-wol stretched out his legs and kicked Gok Soo-chang\u2019s stomach. As Gok Soo-chang was swept away due to the strong impact, Pyo-wol immediately went for Gok Soo-chang\u2019s wrist and twisted it.\u00a0Crunch!\u00a0\u201cKAARGH!\u201dAs his wrists rotated, a hollow bone protruded through the flesh.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He looked at the Gok Soo-chang lying around while holding on to his broken wrist with cool eyes.The First Sword\u2019s gaze quickly turned to Pyo-wol.\u201cDid you do this?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSwing!In an instant, a sharp sound resounded. When Pyo-wol saw that something was glinting up in front of his eyes, a sword was imperceptibly drawn pointing at his neck.Pyo-wol\u2019s shoulders trembled.Even with his eyesight, he could not catch the moment when the sword was drawn.It was a terrifyingly quick sword.It was Pyo-wol\u2019s first time witnessing how a human could draw a sword and wield it so quickly after seeing the First Sword skills.\u00a0It was a mind-blowing feeling.As he perfectly adjusted to the darkness, Pyo-wol thought that he had already become a pretty strong person. This is because he has the ability to see what other children cannot see with their own eyes, and is one step ahead of them.The First Sword\u2019s quick sword shattered his arrogance into pieces.He realized that the skies are high and there are many more stronger people in the world.Pyo-wol does not know how strong the swords are as compared to the others in Jianghu. However, he knew that assassins were not treated as human beings in Jianghu.\u00a0The real masters of Jianghu said that they can break large rocks with just one swing of their hand. Even if you hit it high, it didn\u2019t seem like the single sword had reached that level. (\uc544\ubd80\ub9ac \ub192\uac8c \uccd0\uc918\ub3c4 \uc77c\uac80\uc774 \uadf8 \uc815\ub3c4 \uacbd\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud588\uc744\uac83 \uac19\uc9c0\ub294 \uc54a\uc558\ub2e4.)But even such a single sword could kill Pyo-wol as easily as an ant if the First Sword made up his mind.The sword that was now touching his neck proved that fact. A cold sweat ran down the back of Pyo-wol.First sword applied strength to the sword that touched Pyo-wol\u2019s neck. Pyo-wol clenched his fists involuntarily at the cold feeling that penetrated his skin. Those eyes without any emotion were crazily terrifying.\u2018Am I going to die?\u2019For the first time, Pyo-wol remembered the word death. At this moment, in his eyes, the First Sword appeared to be a reaper. The god of death who has the right to decide his life or death.Pyo-wol bit his lip until it bled.\u2018Did I make a mistake?\u2019He thought that if he wounded the Gok Soo-chang, they wouldn\u2019t punish him. Because that\u2019s what they\u2019ve done so far.They decided that what they wanted was only a useful tool, and that the life and safety of the children were not so important, so he acted like this.\u2018No, I\u2019m not sure yet.\u2019Pyo-wol tried his best to maintain a calm expression. If he revealed his anxiety, he decided that they might swing their sword in disappointment. The pressure applied to the neck grew stronger and stronger. At this rate, the sword will soon pierce through his flesh and enter his muscles.Jureureuk!Blood gushed out from Pyo-wol\u2019s lips.The sword pressure came in through the neck and hurt his internal organs.That was then.The pressure on his neck disappeared like a dream. First sword had quickly withdrawn. He said as he put the sword into its sheath.\u201cAn assassin leaves no traces under any circumstances. Breaking the wrist like this and leaving a mark is no different from telling the opponent your military power and identity.\u201d\u201cKeep in mind. Never leave a mark.\u201dPyo-wol could not easily decide how to respond. So he remained silent. Because he knew that sometimes silence is more effective than giving out a ten-word answer.Perhaps he liked Pyo-wol\u2019s reaction, the First Sword turned around without saying anything more.\u00a0In an instant, Pyo-wol was about to let out the breath he had been holding back.\u2018No, not yet. I must not relax.\u2019Fortunately, he gave out a good look so he passed, but he didn\u2019t know what kind of reaction he would get if he showed a relaxed appearance.Pyo-wol kept his nerves sharp for a long time.* * *Gok Soo-chang eventually died.It was an underground cave where it was difficult to survive even with the best physical condition.The other children did not leave Gok Soo-chang alone, who had broken one arm and could not use his strength properly. Just as Gok Soo-chang did to Pyo-wol, the other children also aimed at Gok Soo-chang under the guise of training.For the first time or two, he somehow managed to survive a difficult incident, but the situation was not easy enough to survive without injuries.\u00a0In the end, Gok Soo-chang could not survive the attacks of the other children and died. The death of Gok Soo-chang has alarmed many children.It\u2019s okay to attack other children, but\u00a0 if they get hurt, they\u2019ll be beaten up by others.\u00a0Pyo-wol also watched Gok Soo-chang die.Although it was not visible on the outside, the attack of the First Sword inflicted a major internal wound on him. Because of that, Pyo-wol had to suffer for several days.Every time he took a deep breath, he felt the pain in his lungs as if its tearing apart. Because of that, Pyo-wol was unable to breathe properly.He couldn\u2019t breathe properly, so of course his energy was weak. Yet Pyo-wol never showed a painful expression.\u00a0 He endured with all his might, and continued to endure again and again.\u00a0As he held on with his strength, his internal injuries began to improve little by little, and now he is completely back to normal.After going through a series of events, Pyo-Yeol realized once again.In this hellish place, the only thing you can believe in is yourself. And to be strong.There was a high probability of surviving here if he could afford to reach the level of the First Sword\u2019s quick sword.\u00a0Pyo-wol bit his lip.The goal was clearly set, but the problem was how to get there.Even with his eyes trained underground, he couldn\u2019t see how the single sword was drawn and wielded. Only the cold feel of the sword was engraved on his neck.\u2018I have to be more aware and responsive. Otherwise, I can\u2019t get out of their grasp forever.\u2019Pyo-wol looked at the Thunder-Splitting method in his hand. It was the only weapon he currently had. He had to find a way using the in the Thunder-Splitting technique.\u00a0He didn\u2019t spare a glance at the Poisonous Dragon Heart method.\u00a0Pyo-wol frantically delved into only one method of cultivation.\u00a0Time passed.The training became more severe.The bridgeheads pushed the children to their limits.There were children who suffocated while learning the Turtle Breathing Technique (\uadc0\uc2dd\ub300\ubc95\uc744 Gwisik Daebeop)1, and there were children who lost their lives by using poison incorrectly.Children have always had to fight death.The custodians took special care in teaching the children swordsmanship and assasination techniques.\u00a0 The martial arts they were teaching them were the martial arts of murder that pursued extreme efficiency. There was no such thing as depth in such a void.If you don\u2019t kill your opponent in one hit, you die.Because of that, they had to risk everything they had on the first hit.The children\u2019s personalities became colder and tougher. Their eyes were like a beast, always full of vigor.\u00a0The custodians pushed the children to death again.\u00a0\u201cYou must not outwardly show your desire to live. Kill the look in your eyes. Don\u2019t express your will to live.\u201d (\u201c\uc0b4\uae30\ub97c \uac89\uc73c\ub85c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uc11c\ub294 \uc548 \ub41c\ub2e4. \ub208\ube5b\uc744 \uc8fd\uc5ec\ub77c. \uc0b4\uae30\ub97c \uc808\ub300 \ud45c\ucd9c\ud558\uc9c0 \ub9c8\ub77c.\u201d)Children who are already full of life are killing to survive again. It never got easy. But they had to. If you can\u2019t do it, it\u2019s because the custodians\u00a0 have been brutally driven. (\uc774\ubbf8 \uc0b4\uae30\uac00 \uac00\ub4dd\ud55c \uc544\uc774\ub4e4\uc774 \ub2e4\uc2dc \uc0b4\uae30\ub97c \uc8fd\uc774\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc808\ub300 \uc26c\uc6b4\uc77c\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud574\uc57c \ud588\ub2e4. \ud574\ub0b4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uba74 \uc601\ub77d\uc5c6\uc774 \uad50\ub450\ub4e4\uc774\uac00\ud639\ud558\uac8c \ubab0\uc544\ucce4\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc774\ub2e4.)Again, many children died in the process.Now there were only about thirty-five children left. They didn\u2019t know how many more of them would die.A bond was formed between the surviving children. They didn\u2019t completely trust each other, but still, a sense of camaraderie was created.* * *The masked instructors looked around with sharp eyes.Now the children simply called him instructor, but his original name was Geum Pyeong.Geum Pyeong was one of the assassins belonging to the Bloody Phantom Corps. He possessed great skills to the extent that more than thirty people had lost their lives at his hands.Geum Pyeong was particularly good at stealth and Turtle Breathing technique.\u00a0His knack for hiding his presence through the Turtle Breathing technique, and aiming for the optimal moment of assassination was unmatched.But he soon retired.Because he was seriously wounded in the process of killing his last assasination target, Go Han-wi (\u9752\u5e73\u4fee\u58eb), an investigator from Cheongpyeong\u00a0 .\u00a0It was such a big wound that his knee should have been cut off. Fortunately, the knee was preserved, but it took years for the wound to heal.Even after the wound healed, it was impossible to regain his former ability. Eventually, he retired from the front lines and took on the task of teaching the children.He was accustomed to seeing the blood of others.At first, he had no choice but to start killing to make a living, but eventually he became accustomed to seeing blood and carried out asssassinations with his own will.Then he taught the children trapped in a narrow cage-like underground cave.\u00a0There was no sense of duty in him to raise juniors. He just couldn\u2019t do assassination missions, so he had no choice but to do this.\u201dNaturally, his heart was filled with anger.At first, the feeling was shrouded just like that, but as time went on, it started to erupt little by little to the surface.Geum Pyeong knew that the negative emotion that sprouted in his heart was anger.His unwillingness to admit that he was pushed out as an old man in the back room and his jealousy towards children are combined and expressed in the form of anger.He did not hide his anger.After all, this place was completely enclosed. Only food was delivered through the baskets they were riding in, but no one came in.There is no way to know from the outside what he is doing here, and there\u2019s no actual boss in this place.The only thing they were interested in was raising children strongly, and they didn\u2019t care how many people died.And because of that, he treated the children more harshly.He looked around with keen eyes.Now was the time to practice the Turtle Breathing Technique to hide their presence.\u00a0First, they use the terrain to hide their body, and then they spread the Turtle Breathing Technique to hide their presence.The essence of the Turtle Breathing Technique is to artificially stop most of the vital functions by slowing the heart rate as much as possible. The natural body temperature would drop and become like a dead person.They are not dead, but they are in a state similar to that of a dead person.Once you spread the Turtle Breathing Technique\u00a0 you will never be able to detect any uninhabited person. However, the extent of mastery is different.Being well versed in the Turtle Breathing Technique, means learning the trick of understanding your body.\u00a0Even the seemingly perfect Turtle Breathing Technique had one drawback.It is a feeling of discomfort that cannot be described in words.In particular, the more vital it is, the deeper the sense of disharmony.\u00a0Because the human body is forcibly made to resemble a dead state, foreign parts inevitably stand out in a lively place.For that reason, even if the same Turtle Breathing Technique were used, those who did not have enough experience would inevitably be detected.\u00a0Thud!Geum Pyeong suddenly stabbed the floor with a knife.\u201cKugh!\u201dSuddenly, someone came out yelling.\u00a0 It was a child who had been caught hiding since his eardrums stood out. A sword of Geum Pyeong was stuck in his shoulder.\u201cIf I were an enemy, you would already be dead.\u201d\u201cKargh!\u201dThe child couldn\u2019t even make an excuse and clenched his teeth.A look of anger was evident on his face.Obviously, he did his best to practice the Turtle Breathing technique, but he\u2019s\u2019 angry that he\u2019s been exposed like this in vain.Geum Pyeong\u00a0 passed by such a child and looked for the next prey.\u00a0Thud!Every time he stabbed something with a knife, the children who were practicing the stealth technique came out wearing scars.There are five children hiding in his area. Four of them were already caught.Now there is only one last person left.\u201cHm\u2026\u201dGeum Pyeong\u00a0 looked around with sharp eyes.He believed he could catch the last one soon. Although his legs were paralyzed, his eyesight and sense of detection were more developed.He mobilized all of his powers to find the remaining child.However, as time passed, no traces of the child were found anywhere.\u2018Is he not here?\u2019After coming to the underground cavity, he opened up all his senses wide for the first time. However, no trace of the last child was found anywhere.No matter where he looked, there was no sense of incongruity.\u2018What?\u2019For the first time, a puzzled expression appeared on his face.It might not be possible to find a person if they reached the peak of the technique. But he couldn\u2019t believe that the children here had already reached that level.He looked around again closely.Instead of looking around, he tried to find a place where he felt a sense of incongruity by mobilizing all his senses. However, no matter how hard he tried, there was no place where he felt uncomfortable any longer.\u2018Aren\u2019t you hiding somewhere else?\u2019Eventually, he doubted that the last child who was missing was here. But he knew best that that couldn\u2019t happen. The children were aware that those who break the rules will be killed.\u00a0It was inconceivable that such children would break the rules and leave this place.Geom Pyeong wandered several times in search of the last remaining child. But he couldn\u2019t find the last child at all.Eventually, he gave up looking and opened his mouth.\u201cI can\u2019t find you, so you can stop and come out now.\u201dAs soon as he finished speaking, the ground shook right next to where he was standing.\u2026!!\u2018He was hiding this close to me!\u2019Geom Pyeong was astounded.\u00a0The fact that he couldn\u2019t find him even though the last child was right next to him frightened him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How is it possible to master the Turtle Breathing Technique to this extent in only six years?!\u2019If it were easy to learn then the four children would never have been discovered by him.\u00a0Not everyone can do it. It was only possible because it was Pyo-wol.\u00a0The abilities that Pyo-wol particularly stood out were stealth, and demonic tactics. His abilities mainly specialized in infiltrating.\u00a0\u2018\u2026Nonetheless, to think his skills are already good enough to deceive me.\u2019He felt the blood in his body cooling down.It was the first sense of crisis he felt after retiring from the life of an assassin.It wasn\u2019t just Pyo-wol.\u00a0Among the children, some of the most extraordinary ones boasted exceptional achievements. Their growth threatened the existing instructors.\u00a0Their senses were so developed that they couldn\u2019t believe they were the same human being. Based on such a developed sense, if they learned martial arts, their achievements would be unmatched.Their growth frightened the custodians.\u00a0It was the evaluation of the custodians that they would not be able to commit an assassination right away.Pyo-wol was one of them.He has not seen sunlight for six years, so his skin is as white as snow, his eyes are bright red, and his face is expressionless.Among the children, the most handsome man was Go Shin-ok.If Go Shin-ok has a delicate body line and a beautiful face that is reminiscent of a woman, Pyo-wol has a sensuality that is difficult to describe in words.The masculine part and the feminine part are mixed to give off a neutral charm.Even the most experienced assassins, like the Geum Pyeeong made his heart shudder just looking at Pyo-wol\u2019s bright red eyes.\u00a0Pyo-wol opened his mouth.\u201cNow that training is over, can I take a break?\u201d\u201cY-Yes!\u201dThe governor stuttered involuntarily.Pyo-wol bowed his head slightly to Geum Pyeong and turned around.He could feel the hot gaze of Geum Pyeong behind his back, but he pretended not to know. He had been in hiding for three days, practicing the Turtle Breathing technique.\u00a0It was good to perfectly spread the Turtle Breathing technique, but because of that, the muscles of his whole body hardened and the function of his organs weakened.In order to recover properly, he had to have a quick breakfast.Pyo-wol\u2019s residence was still in the dark area.It has been six years since he came here. Most of the other children moved to the main hall, but Pyo-wol still stayed here.When he was in a dark and closed space that felt gloomy, Pyo-wol felt the most at ease.Six years have made him that way.Pyo-wol took a seat in one corner of the room and sat down.There was no fear of being attacked from behind, and the front sight was opened so that he could react quickly in case of an emergency.For the past six years, Pyo-wol has lived like this.He always moved with survival in mind, and he trusted no one.Even when the other children moved together according to their interests, he was not swept away and lived alone.Because of that, he was rejected by many children, but he did not pay much attention to it because he was already familiar with the treatment.Pyo-wol closed his eyes and trained quietly.The cultivation method he used was the Thunder-Splitting Cultivation Technique.\u00a0Even though the other children skipped the Poisonous Dragon Heart method and learned other excellent cultivation methods, he was still stuck in learning only the Thunder-Splitting Cultivation Technique.\u00a0That\u2019s not to say that he hasn\u2019t looked at the other cultivation techniques at all.Pyo-wol looked at all the methods given by the instructors. But each time, his conclusion was the same.\u00a0It is said that no other cultivation technique can match the Thunder-Splitting Cultivation Technique.\u00a0Right now, other cultivation methods are more destructive, but as time goes on, the gap will narrow sharply. And sooner or later he will be able to surpass them.\u00a0When he practiced the Thunder-Splitting Technique, he felt as if my body had been penetrated from my head to my toes.It was always mesmerizing.\u00a0Pyo-wol experienced the same feeling every day after his method of cultivating reached a certain point.\u00a0The internal energy learned by the Thunder-Splitting method had the properties of lightning (\u96f7). Although the amount was so small that it could not be excreted from the body, the nerves of Pyo Yue were stimulated every day.At first, it felt bad.His nerves were tingling and it felt quite painful.He could have stopped at that point, but Pyo-wol continued to learn and study the method of cultivation. By the time five years had passed, Pyo-wol realized that his body\u2019s reaction speed had risen dramatically. When there\u2019s an incoming threat, his body reacts even before his head could process what was happening.\u00a0At first, he didn\u2019t know why, but after thinking about it for a while, he soon found out why.The cause was lightning.\u00a0Lightning stimulates the nerves in his brain and develops it.\u00a0One of the facts that he learned while learning the method of cultivating is that all the motor responses of the human body are actually caused by electrical or nerve impulses in the brain.\u00a0Depending on how fast the nerve impulse is transmitted, the reaction speed changes.\u00a0A person whose nerve impulse is transmitted quicker responds that much faster, while a person with a slow nerve impulse transmission recognizes and responds more slowly.In the meantime, Pyo-wol has continuously stimulated his nerves throughout the body with the Thunder-Splitting Method. As a result, he developed a nerve that no one dared to match.Because of this, his reaction speed was so high that no other children dared to match him. Even if they learned and spread the same martial arts, their speed was inevitably different.Another thing had changed.It was what Pyo-wol named the heart speed (\u5fc3\u901f). The expansion of neural networks even increased his speed of thinking.\u00a0 The speed of his thinking was outstanding, it was as if Pyo-wol was thinking in a different time than others.Pyo-wol completely hid all of these facts.\u00a0He only showed his excellence in catching, such as Turtle Breathing Technique and stealth, while he hid his skills in martial arts by making it roughly on par with the other children in the underground cave.\u00a0Only one person knew that fact.In order to get out of this hellish place, he had to hide his abilities by at least five percent, not three percent.That\u2019s how Pyo-wol has spent the last six years.If there is one thing that makes him uneasy, it is that the Thunder-Splitting Cultivation Technique is no longer enough.\u00a0A slightly higher level of cultivation method was needed.A cultivation method that will expand and guide him properly.However, it was impossible to find such a method here.The cultivation methods given by the custodians were all methods that did not have much depth in them. Such methods are very helpful for immediate achievement and growth, but their limitations are too clear when looking into the distant future.\u00a0There were two options for Pyo-wol.\u00a0It was either continuing to learn and develop the Thunder-Splitting method, or learning other cultivation methods that would be helpful in Jianghu.\u00a0But considering that the latter is almost impossible, the former is the only option left now.\u2018Even if I die, I have no choice but to cling to the Thunder-Splitting method\u2026\u2019Pyo-wol thought it was his fate to learn the Thunder-Splitting method.\u00a0All of the children who came in here learned the same method, but he was the only one who dug deep into the technique. Because of this, others did not know that the Thunder-Splitting method had such a utility. And they will never know.Because they have already forgotten the method of cultivation and are digging into different cultivation techniques.\u00a0Pyo-wol destroyed the original copy of the Thunder-Splitting cultivation technique.\u00a0Still, no one cared. Not only the children, but even the custodians.\u00a0The Thunder-Splitting Cultivation Technique was now completely gone.\u00a0Pyo-wol opened his eyes after contemplation.\u00a0In an instant, the red tint in his eyes grew even stronger. But the red glint in his eye soon subsided.Pyo-wol looked around for a moment.The snake that bit him was no longer visible.It was clear that the snake had died at some point, or that it had moved to another place in search of food.Pyo-wol made an expression of regret for a moment, but then left his room with a nonchalant face.He headed towards the largest hall in the underground cavity. When we arrived at the entrance to the hall, he could feel secret gazes from everywhere. It was the eyes of children.\u201cKiki, who is this? Why did your precious body come all the way here?\u201dOne of them appeared and greeted the table. He was an impressive child with a long neck, slightly curved back, and a sullen gaze.His name was So Gyeoksan, and all the other children called him a Hori-man or Tamhonrang (\ud0d0\ud63c\ub791) ( \u98df\u9b42\u72fc Soul Eater Wolf).So Gyeoksan said that he came from an arts troupe who performed miscellaneous plays. Maybe that\u2019s why there were so many re-additions but the most surprising thing was his art of the sword (\u6368\u9a13 sh\u00e8 y\u00e0n).So Gyeoksan talked about how to change the face by drawing a person\u2019s face on silk, layering it over the face, and then tearing it off in an instant.Even if you look with your eyes wide open, you cannot capture the moment when his face changes, but So Gyeoksan was a master of the sword.Instead, there is something different from his face, in that he doesn\u2019t paint his face on silk.He took off the skins of the dead children\u2019s faces and unfolded the sword, but it was so subtle that it was difficult to ascertain the authenticity.Many people were reluctant to use the faces of dead children as if they were theirs.Pyo-wol opened his mouth.\u201cYour face has changed again. Is it Yoo Kwangin\u2019s face?\u201d\u201cKiki! He croaked not too long ago. That\u2019s why I\u2019m using his face.\u201d\u201cYou may forget what your real face looks like at this point.\u201d\u201cWho cares? We can\u2019t even get out of here anyway. If I hadn\u2019t done something like this, I would have gone crazy already.\u201d\u2018\u201cIf you keep doing that, someone will kill you before you go crazy.\u201d\u201cWho? You?\u201d\u201cIt may or may not be.\u201d\u201cKikiki! You\u2019re funny.\u201d\u201cDo you think it\u2019s a joke?\u201d\u201cI mean, I hope it\u2019s a joke.\u201dAs Pyo-wol\u2019s voice lowered slightly, a light of tension appeared on So Gyeoksan\u2019s face.\u2018Unlucky bastard.\u2019So Gyeoksan, who usually fears nothing in the world, strangely felt reluctant in confronting Pyo-wol.Over the course of six years, he has grown terribly.Even compared to So Yeowol and others who stood out in the early days, he achieved a corresponding growth that is not far behind. Because of that, he was not afraid of So Yeowol or the other children.\u00a0But only towards Pyo-wol, he was strangely reluctant.Perhaps it was because Pyo-wol\u2019s appearance in the early days was so intense.At that time, the violence that Pyo-wol committed against Yeom Iljung was just so terrible. But many years have passed.That\u2019s how the children grew up.Now, all the children here are wearing clothes and it is enough to pierce a person\u2019s eyeballs.That\u2019s how poisonous and cruel they became. However, even those children, strangely, would feel reluctant to look at the Pyo-wol, and they would usually step back.\u00a0Apart from his simple martial arts skills, there was something about Pyo-wol that made people afraid. So even if they decide to teach him a lesson someday, they keep on putting it back.\u00a0So Gyeoksan said with a carefree expression on his face.\u201cGo in.\u201dPyo-wol passed by So Gyeoksan and entered the hall.The inside was quite cozy.You can feel the warmth of human life.As Pyo-wol entered, the sitting children raised their heads and looked at them. So Yeowol, Song Cheonwoo, Go Shin-ok, Kang Il and Lee Min.Among the children who survived to the end, they were by far the most outstanding children.Now even the instructors could not treat them recklessly. Their growth exceeded the expectations of the instructors. And because of that, it was impossible to control them unless it was the First Sword, Second Sword, or Third Swords.The children were making a bonfire and grilling something.Pyo-wol naturally sits between them.Even the children were not wary of Pyo-wol.\u00a0They haven\u2019t seen each other for a long time, but there was no reason to ostracize each other.Pyo-wol was staying alone like oil that does not mix with water, but he had done no damage to them, so the children accepted Pyo-wol as a member.Pyo-wol took out a skewer that was being grilled over the bonfire and opened his mouth.\u201cThey seem to care, suddenly sending all this meat.\u201d\u201cRecently, the quality of food has improved a lot.\u201dSo Yeowol said, putting wood into the bonfire. Her eyes were very deep and clear. When she looked at someone, they felt like they were being sucked in. There were many children who were captured by her eyes.Pyo-wol thought as he ate the meat.\u2018It seems that the moment they would be given a mission has arrived.\u2019Even pigs before they were caught are given delicious food.\u00a0There was only one reason why the children suddenly currently have abundant food when they were usually given so little.\u00a0He made eye contact with So Yeowol\u2019s eyes.Her eyes sank as deep as Pyo-wol.\u00a0 It was clear that she also guessed what Pyo-wol had guessed.So Yeowol said.\u201cWe will be put on a mission soon.\u201dCrackle!In an instant, the bonfire blazed even more violently, dyeing the children\u2019s faces red.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 14": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 14Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dFirst Sword took off his mask with a heavy sigh.\u00a0 An expression of an elderly man appeared. In the middle of the old man\u2019s face, a deep black scar was carved diagonally.It was a wound he suffered when he was put on his first mission. The assassin, who people would tremble when they heard his name, was now an old man who\u2019s over sixty years old.\u00a0Although his strength and senses were lower than it had been before, he filled in the gaps with his skillfulness. But as time went on, it became more and more unavoidable.The name of the First Sword was Lim Sayeol. However, his name was only known to him and the Captain.\u00a0He was usually just called the First Sword, so he had never heard his name through anyone else\u2019s mouth. His name seemed unfamiliar.\u201cI guess the time for me to die is nearing. For me to be so sentimental.\u201dFor the past six years, he\u2019s been pushing the kids really hard.They didn\u2019t even care about sacrificing the children. He only cared about raising children successfully. As a result, thirty children passed all the tests and became assassins.From the three hundred people who were first deployed, only a tenth of them survived.Two hundred and seventy victims died to raise thirty assassins, but they felt no guilt.The Jianghu he knew and experienced was a harsh place where anyone would die if they couldn\u2019t kill others. Compared to him who started from the bottom, the children here are more fortunate. They received systematic training to become an assassin.The door opened and the Second sword and Third Sword entered.They were startled to see the First Sword taking off his mask. It\u2019s the first time for them to see Lim Sayeol take off his mask since coming here.\u201cWhy did you take off your mask?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just stifling\u2026 Don\u2019t you think six years is enough?\u201d\u201cTo do-\u201c\u201cYou\u2019re free to take it off as well.\u201dThe Second Sword and Third Sword looked at each other.\u00a0 After quarreling for a while, they took off their masks.\u201cWhew!\u201d\u201cHa!\u201dThey sighed.They simply had their mask removed, but the air coming into their lungs seemed different.\u00a0For them, masks did not simply work to cover their faces. When they were wearing their masks, they felt no sense of ethics or guilt. To them, walking the path of assassins, the mask was an indulgence and another face.They don\u2019t feel any guilt while wearing the mask, but after taking it off like this, they seem to feel weak without realizing it.The name of the Second sword was Gu Shinhaeng, and the name of the Third sword was Sang Ilshin.The three of them took off their masks, revealing their true faces, and sat down at the table.Lim Sayeol said.\u201cAlcohol is best drank at times like this. What a pity.\u201d\u00a0\u201cWe can drink as much as we want when we get out here, can\u2019t we?\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not too long before we get out.\u201dThere was a glimmer of anticipation on the faces of Gu Shinhaeng and Sang Ilshin.\u00a0They spent six years here teaching the children. They did not have much greed in the world, but it was a great pain for them to have to spend such a long time in a place where there is not a single point of sunlight.Now, the promised time is about to run out.It will soon be seven years, and if nothing else happens, the children will be sent to assassinations.They had no idea what the fate of the children involved in the assassination would be.They treated children thoroughly.The children were not their disciples.They were\u00a0 just a one-time use and throw away tools.\u00a0If they showed affection to their tools, they would be the only ones who would get hurt.\u00a0Lim Sayeol asked.\u201cWhat are the levels of the children?\u201d\u201cTheir\u00a0 skills have improved beyond our expectations. So I\u2019m quite hesitant.\u201d\u201cWhy? Are you afraid you won\u2019t be able to control them?\u201d\u201cYes. Some children have already gone beyond the level of the instructors. Geum Pyeong said that he did his best, but he couldn\u2019t find Pyo-wol who practiced the Turtle Breathing Technique.\u201d\u201cHuu\u2026\u201dLim Sayeol let out a sigh.It was Lim Sayeol, the First Sword who paid more attention to the potential of Pyo-Wol more than anyone else. Although his martial arts did not rise as expected, he excelled in the art of stealth and infiltration.\u00a0It can be said that he is the best at tracking and hiding, but if he deceived his attention, he could see that he already had superior skills than the instructors.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a waste.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cThe fact is that we have to use them once and immediately throw them away.\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t help it. Because that was the original contract\u2019s request after all.\u201d\u201cWho the hell is the target of the assassination? Do we really have to do this? Now that the mission is almost over, don\u2019t we need to know too?\u201d\u2018\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t tell you until the mission is over.\u201dLim Sayeol firmly shook his head at Sang Ilshin\u2019s words.It was such a dangerous task.It was enough for the Captain and himself to be the ones who knows the identity of the assassination target. If the name of the assassination target leaks out by mistake, the Blood Phantom Corps will disappear from the world.Gu Shinhaeng and Sang IlShin understood Lim Sayeol\u2019s intentions.To maintain secrecy, the fewer people who know, the better. The more people who know, then the greater the chance of a leak. They knew all too well that a man\u2019s mouth is never heavy.\u201cNow we must begin the final step.\u201dLim Sayeol\u2019s gaze turned to the desk.An anonymous booklet (\u7121\u540d) was placed on the desk.* * *The children looked at Lim Sayeol with curious eyes. To be precise, they were looking at the booklet in Lim Sayeol\u2019s hand.There were no letters written on the yellow cover.It was literally an unknown booklet.Lim Sayeol said, throwing an unknown booklet among the children.\u201cThree of you must learn this.\u201dThe children frowned at Lim Sayeol\u2019s incomprehensible words. But no one opened their mouths. Because even if they don\u2019t ask, Lim Sayeol will teach them.As expected, Lim Sayeol continued his explanation.\u201cIn this booklet, the martial arts technique of a certain faction is roughly arranged. Three of you must master this technique, while the remaining twenty-seven must attack those who have mastered this technique and succeed.\u201dEveryone\u2019s eyes fluttered at Lim Sayeol\u2019s words.Because they understood what his words meant.They were children who were reborn as assassins after six years of rigorous training. The way the children murder was enough to threaten the instructors. It was said that children who will learn the martial art technique presented by Lim Sayeol should be attacked by such children.Not just one or two people, but a sneak attack by all 27 people.As always, there was nothing they can do to take care of the situation. If they do it like in a real battle, there will surely be casualties.It was set up so that those who learned the martial art technique had no choice but to be at a disadvantage. Those who have mastered the martial art techniques are exposed, while the other children will attack in the dark by any means possible.They wouldn\u2019t be able to feel safe when they\u2019re eating, resting, or sleeping. Even they have to be careful of their breathing.The children knew just how good their assassination skills were. Even if only one only aims for one person, breathing is dangerous, but if you are targeted by as many as 27 assassins, it is safe to say that there is no chance of survival.\u2018Such a dog\u2026\u2019\u2018It\u2019s like this until the end\u2026\u2019The children shuddered.They really didn\u2019t expect that things would come down like this until the very end.In their heart, they wanted to start a rebellion at any moment. However, knowing that they could not get out even if they killed the instructors in this place, they had no choice but to hesitate.Lim Sayeol and Gu Shinhaeng saw through the minds of the children.\u2018You won\u2019t be able to escape our hands forever.\u2019The children were hunting dogs.No matter how ferocious and wild the hound was, there was a way to control it. They already have a number of ways to control the children. So there was no reason to be afraid.Now that the whip is blown, it\u2019s time to give the carrots.\u201cInstead\u2026\u201dThe children\u2019s eyes were focused on Lim Sayeol\u2019s face.\u201cThis will be the last time. After this training, we won\u2019t do any training until we get out of here.\u201dLim Sayeol\u2019s words shook the children\u2019s hearts.In the meantime, the children hadn\u2019t let down their guard.\u00a0 That\u2019s because the instructors severely pushed them hard.\u00a0 Thanks to that, the children\u2019s minds became as devastated as a desert, and they stopped trusting anyone.If there is one wish they have, it is that they want to rest in peace, even for a moment. But as if trying to pierce their hearts, Lim Sayeol came out with the sweet bait of rest.It was a proposal that is bound to shake the hearts of the children. With only three sacrifices, the remaining 27 people could rest comfortably.They just don\u2019t have to belong among the three people who would be learning the unknown martial art technique.\u00a0Pyo-Wol was also surprised by Lim Sayeol\u2019s demonic heart.\u2018No, it\u2019s not his plan. It\u2019s probably the idea of \u200b\u200ba person called Captain.\u2019Through his experience, Pyo-Wol knew that Lim Sayeol didn\u2019t have such an excellent mind. Although he was able to perform the given task perfectly, he did not have the brain to plan and invent something for himself.That was the Lim Sayeol that Pyo Wol knew.\u00a0There was no way that Lim Sayeol could have come up with such a plan on his own.Pyo-wol looked at the unknown booklet thrown on the floor.it was not known which swordsmanship was written on the anonymous booklet. However, it was clear that the result would be different from the martial arts they had learned so far.Pyo-wol was greedy for an unknown booklet.\u00a0The problem is that once you learn the martial art technique, he would become a target for other children. If Pyo-wol would become the target of the children who learned how to kill to the extreme like So Yeowol, Song Cheonwoo and Kang Il, it would not be easy to handle.\u00a0\u2018They threw the poisoned bait properly.\u2019The other children did not know, but the bait that Lim Sayeol threw was very tempting to Pyo-wol.After saying what he had to say, Lim Sayeol went out with the custodians. There was an unspoken pressure in deciding which of the children will learn the martial arts on the booklet.\u00a0The children looked at each other without saying a word.It was better to not expect that the children who had not mastered the martial art technique would not take care of the situation. (\uadf8\ub4e4\uc774 \uc0ac\uc815\uc744 \ubd10\uc8fc\uace0 \uc2f6\uc5b4\ub3c4 \uad50\ub450\ub4e4\uc774 \uadf8\ub807\uac8c \ub0b4\ubc84\ub824 \ub450\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc744 \ud14c\ub2c8\uae4c.)Even if they want to take care of things, the custodians won\u2019t let them do that.Knowing that fact, no one dared to learn martial art technique.\u00a0Pyo-wol thought, scanning the children\u2019s faces.\u2018There is a high probability that the martial arts in the booklet are the martial arts that our target of assassination is learning. Even if it is not exactly the same, he must be learning martial arts similar to it.\u2019It was a pretty detailed plan.It was a highly sophisticated technique that allowed the children to experience going against the martial arts directly while simultaneously identifying its loopholes.\u2018I can\u2019t be strong if I don\u2019t take the risks. I can\u2019t stop here.\u2019Pyo-wol made his decision.When he picked up the booklet that had fallen on the floor, the attention of the children was focused.\u201cI\u2019ll learn this martial arts technique. The other two can decide for themselves.\u201d\u201cAre you deciding to be a scapegoat of your own accord?\u201dSo Yeowol asked with an expression that showed she did not understand Pyo-wol\u2019s decision.\u201cWell, whether I will become a scapegoat or a wolf remains to be seen.\u201d\u201cWhy did you make that choice? There\u2019s no way you\u2019d make that choice for nothing. Did you see any potential in the booklet?\u201d\u201cAre you curious? Then you can learn this martial arts too.\u201d\u201cNo thanks. It\u2019s not my taste to sit back and defend. You learn the martial arts in the booklet while I\u2019ll attack.\u201dSo Yeowol shook her head.\u00a0Pyo-wol smiled as if he expected her reaction.\u00a0\u201cWhen someone decides who will learn the martial arts, come to me. I\u2019ll hand it over to you. Now, I\u2019ll be going first.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019d better be careful. Everyone in this room will be aiming for you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201dPyo-wol waved to So Yeowol and the children then headed to the dark area where his room was. Until then, the children only stared at each other\u2019s faces and did nothing. But Pyo-wol knew.That the children will soon start moving. Someone has to decide who will learn the martial arts among them. It didn\u2019t matter who.\u00a0The important thing was to memorize and grasp it perfectly before handing it over to someone else. As soon as Pyo-wol returned to his residence, he opened an unknown booklet.\u00a0[Seventy-two sword strikes crash like waves, and even large rocks are swept away like sand.]It was the first verse of the booklet.\u00a0Pyo-wol couldn\u2019t take his eyes off the first verse.It was because he felt an unknown ringing in his chest.\u201c\u2026Seventy-two sword strikes crashing like waves?\u201dHe imagined himself firing seventy-two sword strikes. However, even if he used all his imagination, he couldn\u2019t see him wielding the sword more than 20 times. Rather than simply wielding a sword, he had to wield it with all his strength with his own strength.The basis of his imagination was his objective level of martial arts.\u2018This is my limit.\u2019Pyo-wol began to realize his limitations. But he was not disappointed.He still had plenty of time left.As long as he survives, he will surely become stronger one way or another.Pyo-wol thought so and read the booklet again.The slaughter continued.[No matter how strong the sun was, the waves continued to crash non-stop, this is not different from the ways of the sword.\u00a0When the opponent is strong, I will continue my breathing, and when the opponent is weak, I will cut off his breathing.\u2026\u2026All waves cannot escape from this flow. If you learn this deeply, you will also learn the other martial arts of the main school (\u5982\u53cd\u638c)].\u00a0There was clearly the name of a particular sect written in the verse. However, the person who obtained the booklet definitely crossed it out given the blackened ink on a certain part.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t just that.In the booklet, there were a lot of deleted phrases.It seemed that an important structure in the flow was deleted.\u2018It\u2019s not a complete copy of the martial arts technique.\u2019Pyo-wol made a sad expression for a moment.In this case, there was no reason to take risks and learn the martial art technique.\u00a0This is because the core is removed and only the shell remained. But Pyo-Wol did not give up.It was Pyo-wol who found a trick in the method of the Thunder-Splitting Cultivation that everyone neglects.\u00a0Although it is currently just a shell right now, if he digs deep, he will surely find something useful even in the nameless technique.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 15": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 15Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChaeeng!Pyo-wol deflected the sword.It was So Yeowol who attacked.\u201cShit!\u201dSo Yeowol put on a sad expression. She couldn\u2019t hide her disappointment for a moment at the fact that her elaborate undercover attack had failed.For this one sneak attack, she waited two days without moving. She waited for Pyo-wol to come.It was such a difficult opportunity.Pyo-wol was attacked thirteen times in one day alone.He was struggling with his nerves all day so he consumed a lot of mental energy. His face was filled with a tired look.It\u2019s fortunate that he had mastered the sword technique written on the nameless booklet, otherwise he would have fallen under someone\u2019s sword already.\u00a0Even though important sentences were omitted, the sword attack boasted considerable power. The fact that Pyo-wol remained alive despite the thirteen secret attacks today was proof of ots strength.\u00a0By mastering the unknown swordsmanship, he was able to unleash seventy-two sword strikes like a wave without stopping. However, important passages were missing and it was impossible to make great progress.All that Pyo-wol learned over the last ten days was the unknown booklet\u2019s swordsmanship.\u00a0It was unreasonable to learn more with an incomplete martial arts technique. However, even at that level, there was no problem in practicing the form to some extent.Pyo-wol resisted the children\u2019s sneak attack with the swordsmanship of the booklet. Because that was what was instructed to them.The children tenaciously observed Pyo-wol\u2019s sword attack. That way, if they saw even a small loophole, they immediately counterattacked.Pyo-wol tried to compensate for the loophole while defending, but the children would find another loophole and attack him. By relentlessly attacking and defending, Pyo-Wol and the children developed.The most difficult person for Pyo-Wol was So Yeowol.This is because she attacked in a way that he was not expecting at all. A little while ago, her skills were once tested on him.\u00a0Suddenly, So Yeowol said,\u201cI think you\u2019d better throw that sword away.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t fear you with a sword for some reason, even if you\u2019re blocking all my attacks. Rather, it feels even more difficult for me when you don\u2019t have your sword.\u201d\u00a0\u201cDo you think it makes sense for me to drop a weapon in front of an assassin?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not for me to know. I\u2019m just saying what I feel.\u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201dPyo-wol frowned without saying a word.So Yeowol looked at Pyo-wol for a moment and then stepped back.\u201cYou\u2019d better be prepared next time.\u201dShe disappeared into the dark.Pyo-wol, who was left alone, sighed and looked at his hand.In his hand was a cheap iron sword that had been provided in batches. It was a dagger that was only half the length of a normal sword. He didn\u2019t really like this sword, so he didn\u2019t use it. Well, this sword was still usable.\u00a0\u201cAm I trickier to deal when I do not have a sword as compared to wielding one?\u201dIf his opponent felt that way, there must be a good reason. It could be that she was lying to weaken Pyo-Wol, but the So Yeowol he knew was not that cunning. So Yeowol was a woman whose distribution was so large that most men could not even reach her toes.Pyo-wol thought while frowning.\u00a0It takes a considerable amount of courage to throw away the sword he was already used to. If he threw away his sword, he had to deal with them using his bare hands.No matter how strong Pyo-wol is, it takes great courage to stand up to opponents who has a weapon in their hand.\u00a0\u201cBut now is the only time to throw away the sword. Once he further gets used to it, he won\u2019t ever be able to throw it away even if he want to.\u201dClang!After pondering for a while, Pyo-wol threw down his sword.For the past six years, he\u2019s done things that others thought impossible.He has perfectly adapted to the darkness, and has developed a strong resistance to poison. \u2018Thanks to learning the Thunder-Splitting Cultivation Technique, he has already reached the limit of human beings in terms of pure physical abilities. Compared to the children who had learned the Poisonous Dragon Heart Cultivation Technique and other methods, his physical abilities were in no way inferior.Pyo-wol believed in his own ability.As he has always done, he will do well this time.Pyo-wol thought so and sank into the darkness.* * *\u201cKukhyuk! Heh heh!\u201dA sound as if the air was being sucked out of a leather bag, came out of a child\u2019s mouth. A short sword was stuck in the child\u2019s chest.The child\u2019s name is Yuk Pyeong.He also learned the unknown swordsmanship like a Pyo-wol. That\u2019s why he\u2019s been plagued with assassination attempts from the other children over the past few months.Yuk Pyeong did not want to learn the unknown swordsmanship. He just unfortunately won the random draw lots.This was the price.The sword stuck in his chest belonged to Song Cheonwoo.Song Cheonwoo and the other 26 children have been targeting the children like Yuk Pyeong who have been persistently learning the unknown swordsmanship over the past few months.The 27 children who sneak attacks and the other 3 children who learned the unknown swordsmanship.The fight they fought was really fierce.\u00a0At first, they felt pity for each other\u2019s circumstances, but in the duration of the training, they were soon wounded and their hatred for each other deepened.Lim Sayeol and the instructors achieved what they wanted.Time passed faster in the dark.The children became more clever and cruel.They learned how to accurately detect the target\u2019s breathing, even in the dark.In particular, they became stronger as they faced the children who had mastered the unknown swordsmanship. They attacked the children who had mastered the unknown swordsmanship by any means possible.The result was a sword stuck in the chest of the Yuk Pyeong.Yuk Pyeong has grown stronger, but the children have completely mastered how to deal with him.\u00a0To be precise, they had figured out a way to destroy the unknown swordsman that Yuk Pyeong had learned.Song Cheonwoo looked at Yuk Pyeong, who was dying with a complicated expression.Even though his human emotions have dried up, he was still not comfortable with killing his fellow colleague.\u00a0But he had no other option.If they fail to kill Yuk Pyeong again, the instructors would have pushed him and the other children to the limit.Song Cheonwoo opened his mouth, thinking that there was nothing he could do.\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201dYuk Pyeong was not able to hear his apology.Because his breath stopped.\u00a0Song Cheonwoo clenched his teeth.\u2018One more.\u2019A child named Go Shin-ho died before Yuk Pyeong. He was also a child who had learned the unknown swordsmanship.The rest of the children had to hunt them so that they could rest comfortably.Song Cheonwoo nodded to So Yeowol, who was far away. Then So Yeowol beckoned to the other children.The children were scattered everywhere.Trying to find the remaining child who had mastered the unknown swordsmanship.Only Song Cheonwoo, So Yeowol, and Lee Min and So Gyeoksan remained.\u201cKiki! This is really amazing. Hikhikhik!\u201dSo Gyeoksan kept laughing. The children knew all too well that he was not laughing because he was happy.So Gyeoksan just always smiled darkly.Whether he\u2019s happy or sad.The problem is that there are only a few times when he actually feels happy on the inside.So Gyeoksan\u2019s laughter was annoying, but Song Cheonwoo didn\u2019t say anything. It is because his feeling of having stopped Yuk Pyeong\u2019s breath has already fallen to the floor.Lee Min opened his mouth.\u201cThe only person left is Pyo-Wol, right?\u201dNo one answered.Everyone\u2019s expression darkened.It\u2019s because they know that the combination of Yuk Pyeong and Go Shin would not even amount to one Pyo-wol.After So Yeowol\u2019s secret attack, Pyo-wol disappeared.He was in an underground room closed on all sides.There was nowhere to run and nowhere to hide. Still, Pyo-wol was not found anywhere.As if he just disappeared.Lee Min opened her mouth carefully.\u201cMaybe he went outside?\u201d\u201cNo, he\u2019s definitely still inside. We just haven\u2019t found him.\u201dSo Yeowol shook her head.At her assertion, Lee Min\u2019s eyes fluttered slightly. Then her explosive beauty flowed out.One of the children who made the most dramatic change was Lee Min. In the dark she became whiter and more prudent.Her beauty, which coexists with ignorance and glamor, was enough to take away the soul of the beholder. Because of that, many of the surviving children were captivated by her beauty to the point of offering supplies.However, Lee Min was not well aware of her changes.She always worked with So Yeowol.If it was So Yeowol\u2019s command, she was loyal enough to the point of pretending to die.Song Cheonwoo said in a cold voice.\u201cHe\u2019s a human too. As long as he\u2019s a human, he can\u2019t get out of our hands.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s Pyo-Wol.\u201d\u00a0Lee Min murmured like a child. But everyone in this room knew what Lee Min was trying to say. Pyo-wol was an incomprehensible person in many ways. They were locked up here together for six years, but no one knew the potential of Pyo-wol.He adapted perfectly, as if he was born here.None of the children had shown the ability that is on par with Pyo-Wol. Even for those with outstanding abilities like So Yeowol and Song Cheonwoo.\u2018Did I give him needless advice?\u2019So Yeowol thought that it might be because of what she said that Pyo-wol hasn\u2019t appeared for this long.\u00a0She didn\u2019t know how much she regretted it after she told him how she felt because of a momentary impulse. It was because she remembered too late that the advice she gave might inadvertently make Pyo-wol even stronger.Pyo-wol has always been like that.He would take the small part that could be overlooked as a cornerstone of development by persistently biting and sagging. When the other children took one step, he seemed to take two or three more steps.Although he thoroughly hid his achievements from the instructors, So Yeowol and the children knew he was hiding his own power.His strength can only be felt by those who have faced him in person.However, So Yeowol couldn\u2019t easily guess what exactly his level was.So Gyeoksan said it as a joke.\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just kill the instructors? It\u2019s probably easier than killing Pyo-wol.\u201d\u201cAgree.\u201dSong Cheonwoo nodded.But they knew.The fact that some kind of restriction was imposed on them.The instructors and three swords they knew were never the ones who would leave it like this without any preparation and countermeasures.\u00a0The question was what was the restriction that was imposed on them.\u201cWe can decide on how to release their restrictions on us later, but now is the time to focus on finding Pyo-wol. If we leave him like this, he will become even stronger.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201dEveryone nodded at So Yeowol\u2019s words.They left in search of Pyo-wol. In the place where the children left, only Yuk Pyeong\u2019s body was lying alone.That was then.Suddenly, Yuk Pyeong\u2019s body began to move.As if he was breathing, Yuk Pyeong\u2019s chest heaved, and he rolled over to one side. And something suddenly appeared from the place where Yuk Pyeong\u2019s body was.It was Pyo-wol who was covered in dirt with all eyes, noses, and mouths.He had been hiding in the ground under the body of Yuk Pyeong by spreading the Turtle Breathing Technique.\u00a0The children could not even imagine that Pyo-wol was hiding right beneath them.\u201cHuu\u2026\u201d\u00a0Pyo-wol sighed and looked at the bodies of the Yuk Pyeong.\u00a0 He was the one who learned the unknown swordsmanship of his own will, but Yuk Pyeong was chosen by many to be targeted.\u00a0Maybe even during his last moments, he thought it was unfair.Pyo-wol reached out and closed Yuk Pyeong\u2019s eyes.This will not relieve the injustice, but he hoped that he would not suffer the pain of keeping his eyes open until he died.Pyo-wol looked in the direction the children disappeared for a moment.Even at this moment, children will be constantly looking for him. The custodians will also be keeping a keen eye on the children\u2019s behavior.In other words, all attention was focused on the pursuit of Pyo-wol.\u00a0It was the moment Pyo-wol wanted.Pyo-wol moved as far as possible while hiding his presence. No matter how talented a human being, he could not completely hide the sound of his footsteps. But Pyo-wol was different.As he moved, not a single sound came out.Just like a cat or a leopard, the soles of the feet absorb sound perfectly.This was not taught by anyone. It was a skill he had learned on his own.The place he headed for was the residence of Lim Sayeol and the others.The children did not know their real names. They were only known as the First sword, Second swords, and Third swords.Their martial skills were far superior to those of the instructors making them the object of fear to children. Even the children who looked down on the instructors could not hide their tension when standing in front of the three swords.After spending six years together, they became psychologically dependent.No matter how large and ferocious an animal may be, it is the same principle as if it were raised from a young age, it would not be able to harm its owner.Pyo-wol called it a psychological taboo.The biggest ban imposed on children was psychological subordination. So they don\u2019t dare consider disobeying them.There was a little bit of tension on Pyo-wol\u2019s face for a moment.Although he thought and moved independently, he was also psychologically subordinated to some extent after living in the same space for six years.But he couldn\u2019t stay like this forever.Pyo-wol shook his head slightly to shake off his anxious mind, and then moved on.His goal was to be the residence of one sword, Lim Sayeol.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was located on the opposite side of the area where Pyo-wol stayed, and it boasted an iron-clad border from the entrance.The instructors who had been dispatched to this place took turns and stood guard directly. Because of that, no one dared to infiltrate this place.It was the instructors who taught the children stealth and infiltration.\u00a0The countermeasures against it were also best known by the instructors.\u00a0The instructors looked around with sharp eyes.As the children\u2019s skills improved, the instructors in particular strengthened their vigilance.They believed that no one would have the courage to sneak in here, but since anything can happen, they could never relax.Little do they know that there would actually be a human being who would be moving cleverly out of their cognitive domain boundaries.It was Pyo-wol who sneaked in without a sound or gesture.Pyo-wol was performing both stealth and Turtle Breathing Technique at the same time.In order to perform the original Turtle Breathing Technique, the biological activities of the body had to be almost stopped like a corpse. He literally has to keep the minimum amount of breathing to maintain his life.Moving was, of course, unimaginable.Of course, the instructors who taught them the Turtle Breathing Technique knew that, and the children who learned the technique used it as it was taught to them. But Pyo-wol was different.Pyo-wol had his doubts after learning how to execute the Turtle Breathing Technique.\u00a0Why would the Turtle Breathing Technique be undone if he moves?\u00a0He wondered how he could move while simultaneously using the Turtle Breathing technique.\u00a0The body had to breathe in order to move.No matter how skilled he was, he could not live without breathing.The greater the movement, the more breathing was required.Turtle Breathing Technique is a method of hiding the presence by inhaling one\u2019s breath for as long and thin as possible to lower the vital signs of the body.\u00a0Because of this, it was impossible to move while using the Turtle Breathing Technique.\u00a0Pyo-wol thought and tried countless times, but failed repeatedly.Then one day, he found a solution.The breakthrough was with the Thunder-Splitting Cultivation Technique. He thought about what it would be like to break his breath into small pieces through the Thunder-Splitting method.If he can\u2019t secretly move while he\u2019s breathing anyway, it\u2019s better to finely divide his breath continuously enough so that other people would not be able to feel it. Then, the body signs could drop significantly, and movement would then be possible, Pyo-wol thought.Pyo-wol put his ideas into practice soon.It wasn\u2019t easy at first.Breaking his breath into pieces almost to the point of stopping his breathing put a great strain on Pyo-wol\u2019s body. Moreover, moving while maintaining such fine breathing placed a greater burden on him.\u00a0However, Pyo-wol did not give up and kept trying. After trying so many times, it became possible to move using the Turtle Breathing Technique at some point.He had succeeded several times against children, but this was the first time he used it against the instructors so he had no choice but to be nervous.He had to maintain his hiding skills while practicing his Turtle Breathing technique.\u00a0The burden on him had increased several times. Pyo-wol moved while simultaneously practicing Turtle Breathing technique and stealth techniques.The instructors were looking straight ahead with their eyes wide open, but they did not notice the passing of the Pyo-wol.This is because Pyo-wol cleverly moved along the areas of their cognitive domain. Ordinary people think that they perceive everything they see, but that was impossible in the first place.Except for the focused area, the brain only sees, and if there is no unusual movement, the brain cannot recognize it. Blindness that cannot be recognized even by looking at it straight with the naked eye.Pyo-wol moved using their blind spot (\u6b7b\u89d2 s\u01d0ji\u01ceo or dead corner).\u00a0Pyo-wol passed between the instructors like a ghost.The instructors were completely unaware that Pyo-wol had passed in front of them.Pyo-wol crept into the cave silently. Perhaps because the security at the entrance was so strict, the guards inside were less than expected. Still, Pyo-wol remained vigilant.This was a sanctuary.If his existence is exposed because of a little bit of carelessness, he will immediately get the attention of the instructors. No matter how much Pyo-wol possessed unrivaled abilities among children, he would be unable to survive turning numerous instructors as an enemy.Pyo-wol calmly grasped his own abilities to that extent.Any point between the near-death heat and the cusps (\uc784\uc0ac\uc5f4\uacfc \uad50\ub450\ub4e4 \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \uc5b4\ub290 \uc9c0\uc810).That was Pyo-wol\u2019s evaluation of his own abilities.\u00a0Pyo-wol looked around Lim Sayeol\u2019s place with his senses sharpened.Lim Sayeol\u2019s residence was located in the deepest part of the cave. Fortunately, Lim Sayeol was not staying in his room. Pyo-wol began to search Lim Sayeol\u2019s residence.Pyo-wol wanted to get out of the underground place. But in order to do so, he needs to remove the restriction that binds the children by identifying the affiliation of the instructors and the three swords. He needs to know which groups they belonged to.\u00a0If he can figure out who their master is and where his base is, it will be easier to get out of their grasp. However, no matter how much he searched the residence of Lim Sayeol, there was no data related to the instructors.Instead, what he found was a letter with a request written on it.[Privy only to the leader of the Blood Phantom GroupDuration: Seven years.Reward: 500,000 gold.Condition: Leave no traces related to the Blood Phantom Group.]\u2018Woo Gunsang?\u2019Pyo-wol frowned.He did not know what kind of person Woo Gunsang was.\u00a0He was curious as to how great Woo Gunsang could be for them to spend 7 years raising children to become assassins. 270 out of 300 have already died during the training just to kill one person.\u00a0He wondered if that one person\u2019s life was as valuable as the sum of the lives of two hundred and seventy, or even three hundred children who entered this place.That was then.Thud!He could feel a presence in the cave outside the door. Pyo-wol hurriedly returned the letter to its original place and then left the room. From the entrance of the cave, he saw a person walking his way.It was difficult to distinguish the figure of the incoming person because of the darkness, but Pyo-wol recognized that it was Lim Sayeol, the owner of this room.Lim Sayeol possessed unparalleled martial arts skills compared to other instructors. His senses were also very sensitive.But Lim Sayeol was not good enough as to detect Pyo-wol who was using his stealth skills and Turtle Breathing technique.\u00a0There was no time to think.Pyo-wol immediately jumped to the ceiling.The artificially trimmed ceiling was so smooth that there was no room to hit a finger. Even if he raised his inner qi\u00a0 and slammed his finger into the wall, there was no choice but to make a sound.Lim Sayeol wasn\u2019t so numb that he couldn\u2019t hear the sound echoing from a short distance away.Pyo-wol hung his nails in the micro grooves. One fingernail was literally the only one supporting the weight of his entire body.He couldn\u2019t even breathe. The moment his breathing becomes even a little rough, the Lim Sayeol will notice him.Pyo-wol looked down at his feet, with his one fingernail supporting his whole body.Lim Sayeol was passing under his feet. He looked around to see if he felt something strange. But he didn\u2019t look up because he didn\u2019t think anyone would be hanging from the ceiling.Pyo-wol concentrated all his nerves on his fingertips.If it had been him in the past, he would not have been able to endure it with only the power of one finger.After So Yeowol\u2019s advice, Pyo-wol abandoned the sword and focused on training his bare hands. While practicing unknown swordsmanship with his bare hands, his grip strength and the delicate sense of his fingers were not the same as before. So now it is possible for him to perform a stunt like this.\u00a0At Pyo-wol\u2019s feet, Lim Sayeol furrowed his brows.Although he is said to have retired from the front line, his senses are not dead yet. As an assassin, the sense he had forged for decades was warning him that something was strange.But he couldn\u2019t figure out what exactly it was.Lim Sayeol looked around again. But he couldn\u2019t find anything odd.\u201cWas I mistaken?\u201dLim Sayeol shook his head, opened the door and went inside. But the moment he entered the room, the sense of abnormality he felt grew even stronger.His eyes turned sharp.Lim Sayeol hurriedly looked around the room. Outwardly, nothing had changed. But the owner of the room could feel it. Something has changed although it was subtle.\u201cSomeone came in.\u201dWithout his permission, both the Second sword and Third sword, let alone the instructors, could not enter his dwelling.The sense of disparity he felt a while ago was not an illusion at all.Bang!Lim Sayeol kicked the door out.When a loud noise resounded in the quiet cave, some instructors jumped out in surprised.\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cAn intruder has entered my room. He may not have completely escaped the cave yet, so find them quickly.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dA look of disbelief appeared on the faces of the instructors. There was only one entrance to this place. And the entrance was always guarded by the pairs taking turns. It was difficult to admit that someone had penetrated through such a tight-knit security.\u00a0But they knew best that Lim Sayeol was not a liar.\u201cWho\u2019s went inside First Sword-sama\u2019s residence without permission?\u201d\u201cMaybe one of the children?\u201dThe children were the only ones who could infiltrate Lim Sayeol\u2019s residence without permission.The complexion of the instructors turned white. They hurriedly searched the cave. But no matter how much they searched, no intruder was found.They questioned the people guarding the entrance to the cave, but they also said they didn\u2019t see anyone coming out.Some people might say that Lim Sayeol might be mistaken, but those who knew him well will never thought of that.\u00a0 The person who was more thorough and sensitive than anyone here was Lim Sayeol.If Lim Sa-yeol said that there\u2019s an intruder, then it was clear that there was an intruder.\u201cWho the hell is it?\u201dThe question is, who broke into this place?No matter how much the instructors thoroughly survey the area, no evidence was found to determine the identity of the intruder.Lim Sayeol invited the Second sword Gu Shinhaeng and the Third sword Sang Ilshin to his residence.\u201cAre you really saying that one of the children broke into this place?\u201d\u201cWho might it be?\u201dTheir faces were gloomy.It was because they thought that one day, when children\u2019s growth rise, there might come the time that they will instigate a rebellion. If anyone were to be treated in this way and to be abused, there was bound to be a resentment.Although some kind of restriction was put in place when the time comes, given the children\u2019s growth, the backlash might happen much faster than they expected.It was a very serious problem.If the children resist before they could even get to the mission, all their efforts over the past six years will go to waste.So before that happens, they have to suppress the resistance of the children.Gu Shinhaeng asked Lim Sayeol.\u201cDoes anyone have a clue on who might the intruder be?\u201d\u201cPyo-wol!\u201d\u201cYes? But he\u2026\u201d\u201cThere is no one more gifted at infiltration than him among the children.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s Pyo-wol.\u201dLim Sa-yeol was certain.There was no evidence, but that was what his senses were telling him.\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. To think he\u2019d infiltrate this place while everyone is chasing him.\u201d\u201cHe came in when no one was inside the residence.\u201dShame appeared on the faces of Gu Shinhaeng and Sang Ilshin.\u00a0They accepted Lim Sayeol\u2019s speculation as a fact.If they left him like this, Pyo-wol might look down even more on the instructors and attack them. So before that, they had to go find and punish him.The problem is that they don\u2019t know where Pyo-wol is hiding now.Even though all the children were chasing after him, Pyo-wol could not be found. They couldn\u2019t be sure that the instructors who had left the front line were better at tracking than the children.Lim Sayeol looked at the two with sharp eyes.\u201cIf we leave Pyo-wol like this, it\u2019s sure to cause big problems.\u201d\u201cBut there\u2019s no solid evidence that he came in here. It\u2019s definitely burdensome to punish him without evidence. I\u2019m also concerned about the backlash of other children.\u201d\u201cSo we have to deal with him in another way. We could direct the children\u2019s opposition to Pyo-wol.\u201d\u201cHow?\u201dSang Ilshin looked at Lim Sayeol in surprise.Lim Sa-yeol nodded his head.\u201cThat\u2019s right! I\u2019m thinking of using Hell Call (\u5730\u7344\u7c4d).\u201d\u201cBut it is the last resort restriction\u2026\u201d\u201cThe time has come to show Pyo-wol and all the children who is holding their lives. Who their true owner is.\u201d\u00a0\u201cWell!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a process that we have to go through at least once, and it\u2019s hard to take this opportunity to break the spirit of not only Pyo-Wol but all of the children.\u201dLim Sa-yeol\u2019s eyes gleamed eerily.Gu Shinhaeng and Sang Ilshin looked at each other\u2019s faces. And they nodded at the same time.With what Lim Sayeol said, the atmosphere of the children these days is not serious. At this point, it didn\u2019t seem too bad to confirm with the children who had the upper hand.Lim Sayeol asked.\u201cDo you agree to the use of hell call?\u201d\u201cI agree.\u201d\u201cI agree.\u201d\u201cThen we shall use it now. Bring it out.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dGu Shinhaeng got up from his seat and went to his room. When he returned after a while, he had flute in his hand.He handed the flute to Lim Sayeol.Lim Sayeol, who was handed the flute, took the two of them out of the cave.As they left the entrance, they saw a huge underground cavity.It was invisible, but there were children hiding in every nook and cranny.\u201cI\u2019ll show you hell.\u201dLim Sayeol bring the Hell Call into his mouth.\u00a0Suddenly, an inaudible sound echoed through the underground cavity.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She tried to hide her emotions, but there was a glimmer of irritation in her eyes.It wasn\u2019t just her.All the children who were tracking Pyo-wol felt the same way as her. All the surviving children were mobilized to pursue the hunt, but no traces of Pyo-wol were found anywhere.All the children were proud that they had a knack for tracking, but it was no use in front of Pyo-wol, who disappeared without a trace.It wasn\u2019t just a feeling of weirdness.\u201cGive me a little more strength. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll find it.\u201d\u201cYou bastard! I didn\u2019t like him from the beginning. I\u2019ll definitely find him.\u201dThe children swept their hair away and heated up the search even more.Some children mustered up their courage and searched the underground room where Pyo-wol\u00a0 resides. However, not even a shadow of Pyo-wol appeared.\u00a0\u201cThat bastard!\u201d\u201cWhat a cowardly bastard\u2026\u201dProfanity toward Pyo-wol broke out among the children.Beep!Suddenly, a loud ringing plagued the children\u2019s ears.At first they thought it was a hallucination. They thought they were only hearing it for themselves. But the tinnitus was heard in everyone\u2019s ears.That was then.\u201cAww!\u201d\u201cOuch!\u201dAll the children fell, grabbing their chests at about the same time.Because they felt pain in their heart. It felt as if an invisible hand was squeezing their heart, and the children could not breathe properly.\u2018What, what?\u2019So Yeowol crouched like a shrimp and trembled. It was the first time she had experienced this kind of pain since she came here. She thought she was already used to all kinds of pain, but this was different.The pain that felt like squeezing her heart soon turned into a pain that felt like an insect gnawed through her body.Not a single one was an exception.The children all collapsed and struggled in agony.Then, out of nowhere, a boy of the same age appeared.It was Pyo-wol who exuded a neutral sensuality given the mixed of his masculine and feminine parts.The children were in so much pain that they did not even notice that Pyo-wol, who they had been searching for so much, had appeared.Pyo-wol looked at the children with a puzzled expression.Twenty-seven children were lying on the floor in pain without missing a single one. Even an ignorant person could know that something unusual was going on.\u2018Is it because of the sound they just made?\u2019Pyo-wol also heard a tinnitus. However, unlike the other children, he did not feel anything.\u00a0It just hurt his ears a little. But the other children, unlike him, were all clutching their chests and rolling around.\u2018They have triggered the restriction.\u2019Pyo-wol\u2019s eyes went cold.The moment he has been waiting for came. But he also had doubts.Everyone suffers from the restriction because only he remained fine.He didn\u2019t feel pain like the other children, and he didn\u2019t show any signs of abnormality. Because of that, he couldn\u2019t understand why the children were in so much pain.Pyo-wol knelt down on one knee and looked at the children.The children rolled their eyes and their complexion turned white. It looked like they were about to die. Pyo-wol took a closer look at Lee Min, who had the most serious condition of them all.\u2018I need to find out the cause.\u2019Pyo-wol carefully injected his inner qi into Lee Min\u2019s body.Even if the person is crazy, it is extremely dangerous to inject internal energy into another person\u2019s body. If he makes a mistake, he could cause a collision between the energies, which could cause you to wear a coin.Nevertheless, the reason Pyo-wol instilled his inner strength into the body of Lee Min is because she has learned the same cultivation method.\u00a0Unlike himself, she learned it at a level that just passed by, but he thought it wouldn\u2019t cause a major conflict because they had the same internal cultivation method.\u00a0Pyo-wol\u2019s guess was correct.Even though the qi was injected, the collision of the energies did not occur in the body of the Lee Min.\u00a0Pyo-wol carefully operated his internal qi.\u00a0This was the first time he had injected his inner qi into another person\u2019s body. That\u2019s why he had to be more careful.Pyo-wol carefully examined the inside of Lee Min\u2019s body. But there was no reaction or alien feeling anywhere.\u2018There\u2019s no issues with her internal energy\u2026\u2019Pyo-wol took his hand off Lee Min-min\u2019s body and fell into deep thought.\u2018What is the difference? The difference between them and me is\u2013the same environment, the same food, the same martial arts.\u2019Of course, he had learned one more unknown swordsmanship, but it was unreasonable to think he was fine because of that.\u2018What? What made me different from them.\u2019Pyo-wol erased what they had in common with them one by one.He erased everything that came to mind, such as food, water, and martial arts, so there was only one left.\u2018Is it poison?\u2019Unlike them, he had great resistance to poison.It was because he was constantly bitten by an unidentified snake.There was only one difference between them and myself.Then it was understandable that the poison could not be pumped out of his body. But the question was not completely resolved.If they were really poisoned, it didn\u2019t make sense that they had seizures at the same moment.It was impossible to trigger the poison that lurked in the bodies of twenty-seven people at one time.What\u2019s more, the poison was just an unidentified tinnitus, if you say it was a sign before a seizure. It was unreasonable to think that the poison that had been dormant in the body was activated simply by the tinnitus.\u2018There\u2019s something more. It is impossible to move the poison by external noise in the first place.\u2019Pyo-wol\u2019s head turned faster.Suddenly, the image of a snake eating an insect came to mind.It controlled the bug by making a cry when it tried to move.\u2018What if it\u2019s not poison, but poisonous bugs dormant in our body?\u2019Then everything clicks.\u00a0It was very easy to put poisonous bugs into the children\u2019s bodies.This is because it can be mixed with water or food supplied from outside.\u2018It must be a kind of cursed poison (\u8831\u6bd2 gu poison).If you put hundreds of poisonous species in one jar, they will eat each other and only the strongest will survive.These surviving insects have a number of bizarre properties. Some of them may have the property of being particularly sensitive to sound. And it was clear that the cursed poison stimulated by the sound emitted poison and consequently poisoned them.As his heart began to harden, Pyo-wol\u2019s head turned more complicated.\u2018Why did they have to trigger the cursed poison at this moment?\u2019Anyway, there was only one reason.It was because of him.\u00a0It was clear that they were convinced that he had invaded the cave which was why they activated the restriction.\u00a0Then the voices of the instructors were heard in the distance.\u201cOver there!\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re all collapsed there!\u201dThe instructors found the children who had fallen and run towards them.\u00a0Pyo-wol was a little conflicted.He could avoid this place if he wanted to. But it was clear that they would discover that he was poison-resistant.It was not yet the time to reveal that he was different from the other children. Pyo-wol, who had quickly gathered his thoughts, fell to the floor and pretended to be poisoned.He used his inner strength to make his complexion pale on purpose, and trembled while grabbing his chest.Shortly thereafter, Lim Sayeol and the instructors appeared.\u201cYou were here.\u201dLim Sayeol found the collapsed Pyo-wol and approached him.His eyes were full of vigor.\u00a0\u2018Isn\u2019t it better to kill him now?\u2019Lim Sayeol was conflicted.In light of the various circumstances, it was not easy to completely control Pyo-wol.\u00a0The inability to get along with other children and the tendency to move alone was also a problem, but above all, it struck him that Pyo-wol\u2019s mind was so deep that he couldn\u2019t understand what he was thinking.\u00a0Although they had been in the same space for six years, Pyo-wol never revealed his true feelings to others.It wasn\u2019t something that could be explained simply by expressing that he had a lot of patience or he didn\u2019t talk much. So Lim Sayeol thought Pyo-wol was very dangerous.Throng!Lim Sayeol drew his sword from its scabbard.Swing!Lim Sayeol thrust the sword into Pyo-wol\u2019s shoulder without hesitation.Pyo-wol did not resist and was hit by the sword.Because he was just pretending to have lost his mind, the feeling of the weapon tearing his muscles and entering his body was vividly conveyed.At the end of the day, Pyo-wol screamed and opened his eyes in excruciating pain. However, Pyo-wol struggled to endure the pain and pretended to have lost his mind.Lim Sayeol whispered into Pyo-wol\u2019s ear with his sword still in it.\u201cWhat did you see in my room?\u201dLim Sayeol said darkly.\u00a0No one will know this terrible feeling he is feeling right now. Every time he saw Pyo-wol, he felt a fear of unknown origin. Although he looked just like the other children, Lim Sayeol knew that this wasn\u2019t his real face.From the first time they met, Pyo-wol had acted differently numerous times.\u00a0Even when the other children were lost because they could not understand the situation properly, only Pyo-wol grasped the situation and moved boldly.The boldness he showed at that time was still deeply engraved in Lim Sayeol\u2019s mind.The decisiveness that Pyo-wol showed at that time was at a level that other children did not dare follow. Then he started to stagnate at some point, and he came down to a level similar to the other children.He only showed his abilities in catching such as hiding and infiltration, but there was no development in his martial arts. So, even people like Gu Shinhaeng and Sang Ilshin lowered their guards against Pyo-wol.Lim Sayeol thought it didn\u2019t make sense.He couldn\u2019t believe the existence that had standed out so prominently had now turned into a normal thing.Then there was only one conclusion.Pyo-wol is hiding himself.It was clear that this young demon had long been hiding his growth. But there was no way to clarify that fact. He clearly knew that a monster was growing inside, but the fact that no one knew except himself made him frustrated.Now was the chance to kill Pyo-wol.He thought that killing him cleanly would have no repercussions.Lim Sayeol drew his sword from Pyo-wol\u2019s shoulder and tried to stab him in the neck again. But at that moment, Gu Shinhaeng and Sang Ilshin deterred him.\u201cYou mustn\u2019t!\u201d\u201cLet go!\u201d\u201cHis infiltration skills are outstanding! His abilities are absolutely necessary for this quest.\u201d\u201cOther children are enough.\u201d\u201cYou know just as well that that\u2019s not true!\u201d\u201cDo you think it will be easy to control him?\u201d\u201cAs long as there is Hell Call, we can manipulate him at any time. As you can see, he is stuck in the poison emitted by cursed poison.\u201dLim Sayeol flinched when Gu Shinhaeng mentioned Hell Call.\u00a0Not only Pyo-wol, but all the children lost their minds and struggled in pain. It was the power of Hell Call.\u00a0Just as Pyo-wol had guessed, the Hell-Call was a piece of equipment capable of incubating the cursed poison hidden in the body. Hell\u2019s sound waves stimulate the poison, and the stimulated insects attack the heart by spewing poison.The poison that spread from the heart flowed through the blood vessels and attacked the whole body.As a result, children are paralyzed and unable to move.If they blow the hell call and the children do not take the antidote on time they will eventually die.So as long as there was a hell call, it was impossible for children to get out of their control and move freely. It is for the same reason that children have been allowed to be left alone as they please in the underground.\u00a0\u201cHuu\u2014\u201dIn the end, Lim Sayeol withdrew the sword that was going to stab Pyo-wol. Then, he gave orders to the instructors.\u201cGive the medicine to the children.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe instructors hurriedly gave the children a pill one at a time.Shortly after taking the medicine, the children\u2019s complexion returned to normal.Speaking of the efficacy of the drug, it was only a temporary relief from addiction. It doesn\u2019t kill the cursed poison that lurked in their body.Lim Sayeol looked down at Pyo-wol.\u2018It would have been easier to kill him now, but now I can\u2019t change my decision.\u2019\u201cKugh!\u201d\u201cHuff!\u201dOne by one, the children who took the antidote came to their senses.Pyo-wol opened his eyes with a moan when he thought it was appropriate.\u201cHngg!\u201dHe deliberately grabbed the part where he was stabbed by Lim Sayeol\u2019s sword and made an absurd expression. Pyo-wol\u2019s acting deceived the instructors, but Lim Sayeol did not lose his doubts.\u201cWhat happened? Why did I suddenly lose consciousness?\u201d\u201cWhat the hell?\u201dThe children still looked confused.The moment they heard a sound in their ears, they lost their minds due to the excruciating pain, so they couldn\u2019t figure out what was going on.At that time, Sang Ilshin spoke in a loud voice so that all the children could hear it.\u201cAll of you are suffering because of Pyo-wol. If he hadn\u2019t invaded our dwelling, you wouldn\u2019t have suffered like this. If something like this happens in the future, all of you will suffer the same pain you felt today. \u201cAt Sang Ilshin\u2019s words, the children looked at Pyo-wol with angry eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 18": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 18Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAlthough he became the public enemy, he did not care.This is because he was already treated this way even before Sang Ilshin\u2019s remarks. He already got used to being hated. He didn\u2019t care because nothing would change even if I was hated more than this.\u2018It was also the cursed poison.\u2019Gu Shinhaeng definitely mentioned cursed poison.\u00a0As Pyo-wol had guessed, he was using cursed poison to impose a restriction on children.There was no way to get out of their grasps not unless they got rid of the insects or the cursed poison in their body.Fortunately, their hell call did not work for Pyo-wol.\u2018I have overcome the cursed poison thanks to the snake venom.\u2019Pyo-wol thought he was lucky.He was not bitten by a snake in anticipation of this particular moment, but as a result, this was his way out of their restriction.\u00a0This gave him one more weapon to escape from them.Lim Sayeol said that he would give the children time to rest until they were put into the mission. Although the children couldn\u2019t catch Pyo-wol, who had learned the unknown swordsmanship, it was decided that training beyond this would not have much effect.The children breathed a sigh of relief when they said that they could rest with peace of mind.They haven\u2019t slept comfortably for a single day in the past six years.Their hatred towards Pyo-wol remained the same, but for now, they wanted to rest without worrying about anything.As Lim Sayeol said, the children were given a sweet rest.The children stopped all of their training sessions and enjoyed the time given to them.Pyo-wol also enjoyed a break in his residence, the first sector. However, his rest was different from that of other children.\u00a0Pyo-wol checked everything he had learned.\u00a0The Thunder-Splitting method, unknown swordsmanship, and the other countless killing methods fluttered in his head.The skills seemed so different from one another that they could never become one, but he felt like they could be united if done well.Pyo-wol did not know how great the work he was trying to do. Perhaps if another warrior had known his true intentions, he would have wrapped up the rice balls and dried them (\uc544\ub9c8 \ub2e4\ub978 \ubb34\uc778\uc774 \uadf8\uc758 \uc18d\ub0b4\ub97c \uc54c\uc558\ub2e4\uba74 \uc8fc\uba39\ubc25\uc744 \uc2f8 \ub4e4\uace0 \ub2e4\ub2c8\uba70 \ub9d0\ub838\uc744 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4).\u00a0It was such a risky endeavor.It was not even possible to try unless the person\u2019s martial arts reached the peak and has an accurate grasp of themselves.In such a dangerous attempt, Pyo-wol tried to trust only his senses. This was nothing new to Pyo-wol.So far he has always been relying on himself.\u00a0There was no one here to teach him proper martial arts.Those who could only teach the art of killing, the instructors, did not give them in-depth prowess or martial arts.\u00a0What they wanted was a murderer who can only obey their orders. An assassin.Therefore, they only taught them how to live at the necessary level, and they couldn\u2019t expect anything more than that.If they want to achieve a higher level of growth, they have to achieve it through their own efforts. And Pyo-wol had a stronger desire for strength than anyone else, and was accustomed to working hard.Concentration that others would have admired if they had seen him was a daily routine for him.Pyo-wol used the unknown swordsmanship and killing methods, while unleashing the Thunder-Splitting Method.\u00a0Shish!A sharp cracking sound echoed in the darkness.The faster Pyo-wol moved, the sharper the sound became. His movements were already far beyond the level of children.Heart rate (\u5fc3\u901f).Now he was able to volley an accident enough to split a thunderbolt. (\uc774\uc81c \uadf8\ub294 \ub0b4\ub9ac\uce58\ub294 \ubcbc\ub77d\uc744 \ucabc\uac24 \uc218 \uc788\uc744 \uc815\ub3c4\ub85c \uc0ac\uace0\ub97c \ubc1c\ub9ac\ud560 \uc218\uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4.)It is a matter of instantaneous judgment and decision making. The acceleration of his thoughts (\u52a0\u901f) had a great impact on his physical abilities.Although the herbivore was crude, the speed was absurdly applied. (\ube44\ub85d\ucd08\uc2dd\uc740\ud22c\ubc15\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ube60\ub974\uae30\uac00 \ube44\uc0c1\uc2dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\ub77c\uc9c4 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4.)All of these were the effects of the Thunder-Splitting method.Pyo-wol delved into the Thunder-Splitting method to the point of obsession. His method of cultivation was developing more bizarrely than the direction the man who had created it had intended.If Pyo-wol had a proper teacher, he would have already been severely scolded and made to learn a safe foundation. However, if he had done so, Pyo-wol\u2019s Thunder-Splitting Cultivation Technique would never have developed the method beyond the creator.\u00a0Rather, it was a paradoxical situation in which he had a achieved greater growth without a teacher.The acceleration of thinking brought the expansion of the imagination.One of the most important things in martial arts was imagination.Even if everyone else said no, those who realized one by one based on their extraordinary imagination were bound to achieve outstanding growth. Of course, the reality was that only a few people have tried it because of the immense risk.There is already a proven safe path, so there is no need to walk the unknown path full of risks.Most of the prestigious sects were like that.They have established themselves over the years, so a stable growth is guaranteed. That is why most people want to become students of prestigious sects.\u00a0Pyo-wol didn\u2019t know that.He didn\u2019t have the usual common sense that people of Jianghu have so he didn\u2019t know people usually choose to learn stable cultivation methods. So he was able to push through with the risky thing he\u2019s about to do without hesitation.\u00a0To others, his location was a dark, dark space, but this place was like a painting for Pyo-Wol. Here, he continuously imagines and turns the picture in his head into reality.Pyo-wol imagined a connection between the Thunder-Splitting method, the unknown sword-fighting method, and the killing method.It wasn\u2019t easy at first.No matter how imaginative he was, it was possible to create something out of nothing. Pyo-wol didn\u2019t have that much capability. Instead, he had a sense of wonder.\u00a0The fine sense he had honed in the dark instinctively showed him the right path.Pyo-wol thoroughly trusted his senses.Because of that, he was able to survive until now.Cissit!Every time the surface moved, the air trembled terribly.\u2018No, not like this. I have to move more stealthily.\u2019It was good to move quickly, but he could not dream of approaching the enemy secretly because the sound was so sharp.It had to be quick and stealthy.Pyo-wol recalled a ghost. He practiced how to move around like a ghost and tried to become like it.\u00a0Sweat flowed non-stop from his body but it did not interfere with his movements. Except when sleeping and resting, Pyo-wol devoted all of his time to training himself.\u00a0He didn\u2019t even come to the underground communal hall.\u00a0Because of that, he couldn\u2019t even see the other children\u2019s faces. Even though he didn\u2019t get along with them and was separated from them, he didn\u2019t feel particularly lonely.\u00a0But it was not the same case for the other children.\u00a0While he was training, he felt a presence moving from this area to the work area.Pyo-wol stopped moving and listened quietly.\u201cYou\u2019re here right?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s awful. To be alone in a place like this.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a really unique person. Rejecting the company of others and choosing to live in such a dreary place.\u201dThrough the darkness, the voices of children were heard.Ordinary people would hear it as just a faint murmur, but Pyo-wol\u2019s senses have already gone beyond human limits, so he could accurately distinguish the owner of those voices.\u2018So Yeowol, Lee Min, So Gyeoksan.\u2019The three children cautiously entered the area.They held torches in their hands.So Gyeoksan murmured, illuminating all directions with a torch.\u201cWhere the hell is this kid hiding?\u201d\u201cWhy are you looking for me?\u201dPyo-wol\u2019s voice came from right behind So Gyeoksan.\u00a0So Gyeoksan looked back in surprise. Behind him stood Pyo-wol like a ghost.\u201cUh, since when were you there?\u201dCold sweat ran down the back of So Gyeoksan. He thought that if Pyo-wol had attempted a sneak attack, he would have died without being able to resist.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cWe wanted to talk.\u201dInstead of So Gyeoksan, who was surprised and unable to say anything, So Yeowol opened her mouth.Pyo-wol\u2019s gaze turned to her.\u201cAbout what?\u201d\u201cThe restriction.\u201d\u201cThe restriction imposed on all of us. Do you know what kind of restriction it is?\u201dSo Yeowol approached Pyo-wol. Pyo-wol looked at her without a word.\u201cEveryone felt pain and fell down at the same time.\u201d\u201cI collapsed too.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the problem.\u201d\u201cProblem?\u201d\u201cWe couldn\u2019t find you until the end, so I\u2019m sure you weren\u2019t there before we collapsed but when we woke up, you\u2019re lying beside us. So it\u2019s clear that you approached us after the restriction was activated. Hence, you were either unaffected by the restriction or it has little effect on you.\u201d\u00a0Surely So Yeowol was smart. The other children were not smart enough to put together what happened previously. Perhaps it was her idea to come here.\u201cI think you know what kind of restriction it is. Am I wrong?\u201d\u201cI know. I know exactly what kind of restriction they put on us.\u201d\u201cTell us, too!\u201d\u201cWhy should I?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhy do I have to tell you guys about the restriction? How does that benefit me?So Yeowol was at a loss for words, so she closed her lips.Instead, it was So Gyeoksan who shouted.\u201cYou bastard, is that what you\u2019re going to say to your colleagues?\u201d\u201cYou guys may be friends with each other, but not me. If you thought we were colleagues, you wouldn\u2019t have pursued me so tenaciously. Don\u2019t you think so?\u201d\u201cHngh!\u201dSo Gyeoksan wrinkled his face. They couldn\u2019t say anything back. In fact, they never even thought of Pyo-wol as a colleague.Pyo-wol was a foreign entity to them.Everyone was reluctant to be with him.\u00a0Only two girls, So Yeowol and Lee Min, would talk to Pyo-wol, while the rest of the children just looked at him like cows and chickens. However, when he used the word colleague, even So Gyeoksan was embarrassed. But So Gyeoksan was no ordinary person.\u201cAlright! Then we can become friends from now on! I swear it! No matter what happens, I will never abandon you, and I will always consider you as a friend!\u201d\u201cAnd you want me to trust you with just that? You sure do have a thick face.\u201d\u201cKikik! You have to have a thick face to learn the face mask arts. There aren\u2019t any cons for you to have someone as capable as me as your friend. If we ever manage to regain our freedom, come visit the Republic Arts Troupe (\u516c\u82b1\u6280\u587e\u5718). Since we\u2019ve been through hell together, I\u2019ll help you at least a little.\u201d\u00a0\u201cThat won\u2019t happen.\u201dPyo-wol laughed bitterly.With his slightly relaxed appearance, So Yeowol and Lee Min didn\u2019t miss the opportunity.\u201cI\u2019ll also consider you a friend from now on, too. At least the kids who follow me won\u2019t be hostile to you.\u201d\u201cI\u2026I will consider you as special. I will never betray you.\u201dLee Min lowered his eyes slightly and made a shy expression. It looked even more enchanting under the light of the torch.Pyo-wol looked at the three for a moment, then opened his mouth.\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dSo Yeowol was delighted with the unexpected words.Pyo-wol nodded and said.\u201cIt\u2019s cursed poison.\u201d\u201cCursed poison?\u201d\u201cWe were all poisoned by cursed poison. It\u2019s a type of poisonous organism. It is normally dormant in our body, but it emits poison in response to the sound waves of the flute they blow. The poison swirls through our blood vessels and attacks our internal organs.\u201d\u201cThen how did you endure the poison of cursed poison for so long?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m strong against poison from the beginning. So I was able to move even after you lost your mind.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u201d\u201cNow that I\u2019ve told you everything, you guys have to figure out on your own how to get rid of the cursed poison.\u201dPyo-wol told them the truth. Not because of the children\u2019s suggestions, but because he decided that it was in his favor.\u00a0The more variables there are, the better. Even if only one or two of the children get out of the cursed poison, a lot of variables will be created.Even if that was\u00a0 not enough, Pyo-wol was satisfied.So Yeowol looked at Pyo-wol for a moment without saying a word.The more she looked, the more interesting he was. He was clearly of the same age as them, but the way he thinks and does is beyond their imagination.\u2018Where the hell did something like him come from?\u2019So Yeowol shook her head slightly.This is because the human being called Pyo-wol itself was difficult to understand.In any group, there is bound to be a person who refuses to be ordinary, but Pyo-wol\u2019s case was severe. So it makes sense why the other children were more reluctant in dealing with Pyo-Wol.Now that they have achieved their goal, it\u2019s time for them to go back.\u201cThank you! I will definitely make sure to return the favor. If you need anything later, come to me. I will do my best to help.\u201d\u201cI will.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll get going then\u201dSo Yeowol turned and headed outside. Sogyeoksan also waved her hand and followed her.Lee Min, who remained until the end, suddenly opened her mouth.\u201cLee Seol-min.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s my real name. I want you to remember it.\u201dLee Min smiled when lightly blushing.\u00a0Under the light, her lips glowed exceptionally red.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Still, all the children instinctively noticed that today was something different from any other day.Because of this, the atmosphere was chaotic in the morning.The children who usually stay away from each other gathered one by one to the center of the underground communal area.Among them was Pyo-wol.\u00a0Pyo-wol came out of section one with a strange premonition and also went to the center of the underground cavity.\u201cYou must have felt it too.\u201dSo Gyeoksan spoke to Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol silently nodded and looked around.The instructors have not yet appeared. But somewhere, he could feel they were moving in a hurry.That was then.Lim Sayeol appeared together with Gu Shinhaeng and Sang Ilshin.All of the children stopped whatever they were doing and looked at them.\u00a0Their attire was different from usual. They were still wearing their masks on their faces, but the outfit they wore looked more refined. It was clothes they haven\u2019t worn in any of the training sessions before.\u00a0As the three of them approached, the children looked at them while holding their breath.Lim Sayeol looked at the children for a moment and then opened his mouth.\u201cToday, we will leave this cave.\u201dThe children widened their eyes.They expected it to some extent, but hearing it through Lim Sayeol\u2019s mouth still gave off a different feeling. Nonetheless, no one dared to open their mouths to speak or shout.\u00a0They were forbidden to open their mouths in a public gathering without the instructor\u2019s or the sword\u2019s permission. But their wide eyes expressed their feelings at the recent announcement.\u00a0\u2018We\u2019re finally going out?\u2019Pyo-wol\u2019s face had mixed emotions. Pyo-wol might have adapted to this place better than anyone else, but it wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t miss the outside world. Even though he had been here for a long time with his memory fuzzy, he still wanted to feel the fresh air from outside.\u00a0Lim Sayeol looked at the children\u2019s faces and said.\u201cThe instructors will go out first, and then it will be your turn. So Yeowol.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dSo Yeowol stepped forward and answered.\u201cYou take responsibility and bring the other children out.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t just Pyo-wol who thought that So Yeowol\u2019s voice was particularly lively.A look of anticipation could be seen over the children\u2019s faces.\u00a0 It had been almost seven years since they were imprisoned in the underground cave.\u00a0Leaving this place meant that they would soon be put on a mission.Not a single child was unaware of that fact. But it was a good thing nonetheless. The fact that they were able to escape from this hellish place made them happy.Soon after, the instructors appeared.The instructors, like Lim Sayeol and other two swords, also had a change of clothes. Although their faces were covered with a mask, there was a youthful expression of excitement in their eyes.Even if they have been trained to hide their emotions, they can\u2019t help but be excited to go out after 7 years.Among the instructors, only Lim Sayeol remained unmoved and kept a cold gaze. He thought as he looked at the children.\u2018How many of them will end up surviving?\u2019The children were strong.Although they did not master excellent martial arts like the masters at Jianghu, they were still basically stronger compared to others.\u00a0Before teaching them martial arts, the children were thrown into an extreme situation and let them come out on it on their own. In addition, they were always in a state of extreme competition, making it impossible for them to survive not unless they decided to kill their opponents.These were the children who went through that process.Even if they failed to master martial arts, they could be said to be strong enough as a person.\u00a0The children who went through such a fierce struggle for survival learned to live to a high degree. Each child was like a ferocious beast. However, no matter how advanced their killing techniques were, they were still not the best in Jianghu.\u00a0The target of their assassination is not the most powerful person in Jianghu, but rather, someone who is highly likely to become one in the future. A man of great potential.Lim Sayeol did not dare to guess how many children would survive against him.\u2018Anyway, I don\u2019t know.\u2019His mission was just to raise children to a certain level. Anything more than that was already outside of his responsibility.Now that he has finished his job, all that remains is to enjoy his retirement life.\u00a0 He is finally about to end this tedious assassin life.Thud!A basket fell from the ceiling.Some of the instructors, led by Lim Sayeol, got on a huge basket. Then the basket went up to the ceiling again.It was a long time later that the basket came down again.The remaining instructors climbed into the basket and disappeared. Now, only Pyo-wol and the children remained in the underground cave.\u00a0So Yeowol approached Pyo-wol.\u201cAre we going to be put on a mission soon?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Because they raised us for that sole reason.\u201d\u201cDo you know who the target of the assassination is?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dPyo-wol shook his head.He knew the name of Woo Gunsang, but he had no intentions of making it known to So Yeowol or the other children. Because the less who know the secret, the better.Pyo-wol asked as if he had suddenly remembered.\u201cWhat happened to the cursed poison?\u201d\u201cA few of us have been detoxified.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dPyo-wol gave a surprised expression. Because he knew that detoxing the cursed poison was not easy.So Yeowol smiled softly.\u201cMin knows a lot about poison.\u201d\u201cLee Min?\u201dSo Yeowol just nodded her head. She didn\u2019t give any more details no did Pyo-wol ask for more.\u2018Lee Seol-min.\u2019It was the real name of Lee Min.Like most of the children here, her past was also thoroughly hidden by an iron curtain. He wouldn\u2019t\u00a0 know what kind of past she had not until she would share it herself.Even so, the fact that she was able to detoxify the cursed poison in such a short time meant that her ability was great.Pyo-wol looked at So Yeowol\u2019s side face half-heartedly.So Yeowol was just as beautiful as Lee Min. In particular, as she had not seen sunlight for seven years, her white skin was enough to steal the souls of men. So Yeowol knew that she was beautiful and knew how to use her beauty as a weapon.Perhaps she taught only a few children who followed her how to detoxify cursed poison. Knowing how to detoxify the cursed poison was also a great weapon for her.The ability to use everything around him was truly innate.That was then.Thud!The basket came down again with a dull sound.\u201cFinally!\u201d\u201cWe can go out!\u201dThe children were excited.Now it was their turn to leave.Since they\u2019re about to see the sunlight for the first time in seven years, they couldn\u2019t help but be excited no matter how coldhearted they\u2019ve gotten.\u00a0So Yeowol stepped forward and said,\u201cThe basket isn\u2019t big enough for everyone to ride, so half of us would ride it first, while the rest would wait for the basket to come down again.\u201d\u201cWho wants to get up first?\u201d\u201cCheolpyeong, Jinsam, and In Mokso\u2026\u201d\u00a0So Yeowol called the children\u2019s names as they waited.\u00a0A light of joy flashed on the faces of the children who were called. The children who were not called did not show any particular dissatisfaction.This was because So Yeowol and her closest aides remained for the last.\u00a0 The children who were called hurriedly climbed into the basket.\u201cI\u2019ll go up first and wait.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll go ahead.\u201dThe basket with the children went up again.Pyo-wol looked around with his arms crossed.The sunlight was almost gone, and most of the structure was engulfed in darkness, but it was still clearly visible to Pyo-wol\u2019s eyes.This had been the place where they spent seven years.He might not have any good memories in this place, but it can\u2019t be denied that he felt somewhat sad now that he was about to leave this place.\u00a0Pyo-wol suddenly removed the expression on his face.\u00a0\u2018What kind of feelings\u2014\u201d\u00a0This place was hell.Here he became a demon.They were taught how to kill people.\u00a0His hands were stained with children\u2019s blood, and the smell of blood continues to linger.In order to live, he had to kill others, and he had to thoroughly hide his feelings and inner thoughts. So his emotions were worn out, and the only thing that was left was a monster who knows how to kill.\u00a0The human in Pyo-wol died. Only Pyo-wol, who was reborn as a monster, remained.Maybe this place was the best fit for Pyo-wol.If the basket had not come down at the right time, Pyo-wol\u2019s thoughts might have continued endlessly.Thud!The basket came down with a dull sound.A light of joy flashed on the faces of the children who were left for last.\u00a0The fact that they could go out soon, no matter how hard they tried to pretend, made them excited.Thump!Finally, the basket reached the floor.The children lined up and climbed into the basket.Finally, there was no one left and all of them were battered. So Yeowol pulled the string tied to the basket. Then the basket slowly began to rise to the ceiling.The basket went up continuously.\u00a0They continued to climb up past what they thought was the ceiling.It felt like hundreds of sheets were going up vertically.\u201cYou mean we were in such a deep underground?\u201d\u201cThis is crazy\u2026\u201dOnly then did the children tremble when they realized the reality of the place where they were imprisoned.They weren\u2019t just in a hellish place, they were literally in hell. If someone from above had not lowered the basket, they would have starved.A white light sphere could be seen in the distance.Recognizing that it was an outside light, Pyo-wol ripped his sleeve and made a long piece of cloth. Although his clothes that had been ripped became messy like rags, Pyo-wol didn\u2019t care.He quickly covered his eyes with a cloth and tied them tightly.So Yeowol and Lee Min, who looked at the scene with puzzled expressions, realized something and quickly followed suit.\u201cWhy\u2026?\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing\u2026\u201dThe children asked with a puzzled look on their faces.So Yeowol said, tying the cloth tightly.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to go blind then cover your eyes.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201d\u201cShit!\u201dOnly then did the children realize why Pyo-wol and So Yeowol acted the way they did.His eyes, which had not seen sunlight for as many as seven years, were weak. He wondered what the consequences would be if he looked directly at the sun without an acclimatization period.Either his eyes will completely be blinded or his eyes will be severely damaged.So action had to be taken before that.The children hastily tore a fabric and covered their eyes. Still, the closer they got to the ground, the stronger the light felt.The intense light that pierced through the fabric seemed to pierce even their eyelids. Even with their eyes closed, tears started to flow due to the pain.It was the same with Pyo-wol.\u00a0Rather, the pain he felt was greater than that of the other children. His eyes were more sensitive because his eyes have perfectly adapted to the darkness. The pouring light was like a weapon that threatened his life now.\u00a0His pure white skin, which had not seen sunlight for a long time, was already reddish.He got a minor burn from just contact with normal sunlight. It was the same with the other children.\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cOh, it hurts!\u201dThe children groaned involuntarily.They had developed a tolerance for almost all kinds of pain, but they didn\u2019t know that the sunlight which they had so longed for would cause them to feel such pain.Thud!Finally, the basket they got on was completely out of the ground. Waiting for the children was a group of warriors dressed in black.The warriors whose eyes were on the children were assassins from the Blood Phantom Corps. Among them was a particularly skinny middle-aged man.He had glass-like eyes and an expressionless face, which seems incapable of human emotions. His features give off an uncomfortable feeling to anyone who would look at him.\u00a0A moon-shaped sword hung around his waist.The name of the sword is Blood Moon Knife (\u8840\u6708\u5200).\u00a0It was a man\u2019s affair. (\ub0a8\uc790\uc758\uc560\ubcd1\uc774\uc5c8\ub2e4.)He doesn\u2019t know how many people have died so far because of the deformed blood moon knife.\u00a0The owner of the Blood Moon Knife signifies the captain of the Blood Phantom Group.\u00a0The man\u2019s name is Gu Juyang.He was the master of the Blood Moon Knife and the man who reigned as the captain of the Blood Phantom Group of assassins.\u00a0It had been a long time since he appeared in broad daylight.\u00a0Today was the day when the results of the seven years and \u200b\u200benormous funds spent in training the children were put out into the world.Of course, he had to check the results with his own two eyes.There was a small smile on his lips.\u201cWe seem to have created some useful ones. I\u2019m sure the client will be satisfied.\u201dAlthough the children were suffering from the sunlight, eerie energy was flowing from their whole body.This was enough to be spent on this hunt.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If left under the sun for a little more time, it seemed that his whole body would turn to ashes.The excruciating pain did not bring the other children to their senses, but Pyo-wol did not lose his temper. He closed his eyes, endured the pain, and listened to the sounds around him.Then a voice pierced into his ear.\u201cWe seem to have created some useful ones. I\u2019m sure the client will be satisfied.\u201dAs soon as he heard the voice that contained no emotions, Pyo-wol realized that he was the Captain of the Blood Phantom Group.\u00a0It was because he felt extraordinary confidence in the person\u2019s voice.Those who only receive orders from others can never make such a voice. Moreover, while the man spoke, the others remained silent.It meant that only he deserved to open his mouth at this point.Pyo-wol made sure to remember the man\u2019s voice.Another voice was heard.\u201cPut them all in the wagon. Move them to the Clear Wind Manor (Cheongpungjang)1\u00a0and have them adapt them to the outside world.\u201d\u201cBy your order!\u201dAssassins of the Blood Phantom Corps answered as they approached the children. They formed a pair and went side by side with the children. They took each of the children\u2019s arm and dragged them to the wagon that was prepared in advance.\u00a0The inside of the carriage was completely blocked from outside light using a blackout curtain. The assassins pushed the children into the wagon without hesitation.\u201cHeup!\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201dWhen the door closed and the light from outside was completely blocked, the children took off the cloth that covered their eyes. They all each have an expression that shows that they can finally live.Pyo-wol also unwrapped the cloth that covered his eyes and leaned his back against the wall of the wagon.The carriage was like a cage for animals with how cramped it was. Dozens of people were crammed into a tight space that could have been full even if only three or four people fit in.Thanks to this, the children were unable to move and could only breathe heavily.\u2018We\u2019re being treated like an animal until the end.\u2019The children\u2019s eyes blazed with anger in the darkness.\u00a0They were used to being treated like sub-human, but they didn\u2019t really know that they would be treated like this even when they went out of the underground. They thought the treatment would be a little better when they came out, but the fact that nothing had changed made them despair.Pyo-wol leaned against the wall and closed his eyes.There was nothing he could do here anyway. It would have been better for him to take a little rest and conserve his stamina.The carriage was so cramped that it was difficult to even breathe, but Pyo-wol tried to relax by loosening the muscles of his body as much as possible.The carriage moved non-stop.By intuition, Pyo-wol noticed that more than a day and a half had passed.For such a long time, the assassins of the Blood Phantom Corps not once opened the door of the wagon or gave them food. Thanks to this, the children had to spend the whole day starving.Creak!When the hunger of the children reached its peak, the carriage stopped.Pyo-wol had a gut feeling that they had finally arrived at their destination.After a while, the carriage door opened.\u201cEveryone get out.\u201dAssassins of the Blood Phantom Gro dragged the children out of the wagon.The children were afraid to see the sun again, but luckily they arrived at night. So they were able to get out of the carriage without fear of the sun.The carriage arrived at a small manor surrounded by a high wall.When all the children came out of the wagon, Gu Juyang said.\u201cThis is where you will be staying from now on. This is where you will adjust to life outside. Don\u2019t be relieved that you\u2019re outside. I\u2019ll cut off the breath of any indolent bastards myself.\u201dThe children couldn\u2019t even breathe deeply at the breathtaking voice of Gu Juyang. That is how intense the presence of Gu Juyang was.To the extent that even these strong children are terrified.He beckoned the assassins to put the children into their respective rooms. Still, the room was better than the carriage. It was because they were assigned to the signing room.Pyo-wol was assigned the same room as So Gyeoksan and Go Shinok.They had been together for seven years in the basement, but this was the first time they had been together in the same room like this.\u00a0There was no awkwardness in between So Gyeoksan and Go Shinok, but since Pyo-wol was a complete stranger, having him join was inevitably uncomfortable in many ways.Pyo-wol also noticed that fact and said.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. It doesn\u2019t matter if you treat me as someone who doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d\u201cKikik! Who cares?\u201dSo Gyeoksan replied with his characteristic bizarre smile.The only furniture in the room was four old wooden bunks and a desk. There was a change of clothes on the wooden bed.At first glance, they were cheap clothes of poor quality, but at least they were better than the current clothes the children were wearing now.The clothes of children who had not changed properly for such a long time were worse than a rag. It was because they couldn\u2019t wash it properly, so the stench remained.\u00a0\u201cI need to go and wash up.\u201d\u201cWhere?\u201dPyo-wol silently pointed his finger at the window.A well could be seen through the window.\u201cAh!\u201d\u201cA well?\u201dSo Gyeoksan and Go Shin-ok burst out in exclamation.In the past seven years, they weren\u2019t able to properly wash themselves. There was not enough water to drink, so they couldn\u2019t waste water on washing.While they were admiring the view, Pyo-wol had already arrived at the well.Under the dim moonlight, Pyo-wol took off his clothes and poured water from the well on his body.The cold feeling on his body made him realize that he was back in the outside world.\u2018I\u2019m finally here.\u2019Pyo-wol once again splashed water on his body.\u201cLet\u2019s wash together.\u201dSo Gyeoksan threw off his clothes and ran to the well. After that, Go Shinok and another child followed.\u00a0For the first time in seven years, they washed, ate to their fullest and rested freely.Over the next seven days, Pyo-wol gradually increased the amount of his time in the sun.At first, it was extremely painful to stand for half an hour, but after seven days, he was able to endure it for several hours without any problem.\u00a0So were his eyes.\u00a0At first, he almost closed his eyes and moved only by hearing, but after a while, he was able to walk with his eyes open even in broad daylight. However, there was not much space for them to move freely.At best, the backyard was all they could get to loiter around. Still, the children looked happy. The blue sky seen over the high wall, the fresh smell of air, the sound of grasshoppers, and the flowers blooming under the wall made them happy.It was a scene they thought they would never see again.They managed to capture the scenery that the children who died in the underground cave wanted to see at least once.\u2018It\u2019s okay for me to die right now.\u2019Some children even shed tears due to intense emotion. It wasn\u2019t that much, but they were quite touched. They realized how precious the scenery that they took for granted when they were young.\u00a0But the Pyo-wol knew.The happiness they are all feeling right now will not last long.The Blood Phantom Corps had a clear purpose in raising them.Pulling them out of the dark meant it was time to use them.Now that they have all perfectly adapted to the sun, there\u2019s no reason to wait any longer.Pyo-wol\u2019s conjecture soon became true.\u201cI\u2019ll hand out the weapons, so from now on keep them safe. You\u2019ll use them soon.\u201dThe Blood Phantom Corps provided the children with swords, gifts, and tools used in disguise.The smiles disappeared from the children\u2019s faces.They too felt that the time had come to be put on the mission.* * *Gu Juyang\u2019s residence was located in Great Moon Hall, the largest hall in Cheongpungjang2.Cheongpungjang was originally prepared by a certain rich merchant to spend his old age. He wanted to live comfortably with his lover and die in peace, but his wish did not come true.While sleeping in the arms of his lover, he was attacked by an assassin and died screaming.All the family members who were working left, and Cheongpungjang was naturally ruined. The abandoned Cheongpungjang became the base for the Blood Phantom Group.\u00a0The young assassin who assassinated the old owner of Cheongpungjang was now a middle-aged man occupying the bedroom.Lim Sayeol, who took off the mask, sat in front of Gu Juyang.Like Pyo-wol and the children, Lim Sayeol and the instructors had struggled to adapt to the sunlight they saw for the first time in seven years.The younger people adapted a little more quickly, but the older people like Lim Sayeol had to suffer for a long time.Gu Juyang looked into Lim Sayeol\u2019s face.\u201cYou\u2019ve been struggling all these years\u201d\u201cOf course, I only did what I had to do.\u201d\u201cOur group became more prosperous thanks to the sacrifices of you and the others, uncle. I\u2019m not sure how to repay all of these favors.\u201d\u201cThere is no favor to repay. I would already be dead if it weren\u2019t for the former head.\u201dLim Sayeol won with a bluntness.It was Gu Jangpyeong, the father of Gu Juyang, who led him down the path of an assassin, who had a difficult life trying to make a living.If it wasn\u2019t for him, Lim Sa-yeol would have died earlier in some place. In order to repay the favor, Lim Sayeol has been faithful to his savior for generations.Whoosh!Gu Juyang poured alcohol into the glass placed in front of Lim Sayeol.\u201cUncle has done his job. You may rest now.\u201d\u201cAre you finally allowing me to retire?\u201d\u201cOf course. I have taken measures so that not only uncle, but also the Second sword and the Third sword can retire.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s no problem at all! You\u2019ve always dedicated your life to the Blood Phantom Group so I should give you at least this much favor.\u201dGu Juyang poured alcohol into his glass as well.Lim Sayeol looked at him with eyes filled with mixed emotions. He devoted his whole life to the Blood Phantom Corps until it was okay for him to retire completely. He didn\u2019t know how much time he had left, but the fact that he could live the rest of his life regardless of the Blood Phantom Group was enough to satisfy him.Lim Sayeol picked up the glass of wine poured by Gu Juyang.The cheap, strong liquor he was currently drinking felt more delicious than any other drink he had ever drank.Gu Juyang also smiled slightly and took a glass of wine. Unlike Lim Sayeol, he only slightly moistened his mouth.Lim Sayeol is now fully retired, but he was different.If you drink too much alcohol, your nerves will become dull, and your judgment will be affected. To an assassin whose life or death could be decided by a momentary judgment, alcohol was like poison. Because of that, he never had more than one drink before.Suddenly, Lim Sayeol opened his mouth.\u201cThose children are really pitiful. Their qualities and abilities are too great to be used once and thrown away.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dGu Juyang shook his head.Through correspondence sent by Lim Sayeol on a regular basis, he was well aware of the terrifying development of children trapped in an underground cavity.If they can fully absorb the children, the Blood Phantom Group will be able to emerge as the strongest assassin group. But they couldn\u2019t.\u00a0That was the condition of the contract with the client in the first place.The client wanted assassins who are completely new faces, not just any existing assassins. Gu Juyang thought that the reason was to completely hide the identity of the client.In fact, even though he received a huge request worth 500,000 gold, he did not even know the identity of the client.If the Blood Phantom Group had not discovered the underground cave by chance, they would not have accepted this quest.It was close to impossible to avoid the eyes of the world and raise a new army of assassins.The first to discover the underground cave was Gu Jangpyeong, the former Captain of the Blood Phantom Group.He discovered an underground cavity by chance. An underground cavity where traces of man-made terrain remain.After several years of research, Gu Jangpyeong concluded that this underground cavity was probably a secret facility operated by one of the thirteen tribes of the old Magyo.\u00a0However, it was not possible to ascertain exactly which tribe the facility belonged to.In fact, it didn\u2019t matter who the original owner was.The important thing is that the underground cavity is a facility abandoned a long time ago, and it has an optimal environment to train new assassins while avoiding the eyes of the world.From the beginning, it was possible to teach martial arts and put the children into the underground cavity, but Gu Juyang did not.\u00a0Rather, children who had never learned anything were thrown into extreme environments, and only the surviving children were taught martial arts and trained as assassins.They\u2019ve done this because it was judged to be much more efficient.In fact, the amount they spent to raise the children as assassins was only 100,000 nyang of gold. He invested only 100,000 nyang and made a profit of over 400,000 nyang.More than ten times the number of children who survived lost their lives, but their deaths did not faze Gu Juyang.\u00a0After all, they were children who were randomly kidnapped from all over Jianghu. Most of them were orphans who wandered around the river without any connection, so no one would care\u00a0 whether or not they would disappear.\u00a0They perfectly meet the requirements of the client.\u201cTheir abilities are precious, but there is nothing we can do about it. Our relationship with them ends here.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about them either, uncle, and enjoy your retirement life. It would be nice for you to have a pretty girl as a concubine.\u201d\u201cHave you figured out who the client is?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know either. If we want to do this for a long time, we shouldn\u2019t cross the line/\u201dThe corner of his mouth twisted upwards. It wasn\u2019t difficult to find out who the client was if he wanted to.However, it was a request worth 500,000 nyang of gold.If he invested that much money and seven years of time, he wouldn\u2019t be an ordinary tycoon. There was no reason to pretend to be such a big guy for nothing.Despite the fact that the Blood Phantom Group had the size and ability to fit among the top ten powerful assassin groups, it was still an assassin group.\u00a0No matter how great the assassin group was, it could not be compared to the powerful and prestigious sects.Even if only one of the powerful and prestigious sects come forward, a group of assassins the size of the Bloody Phantom Group will be annihilated in an instant.The only exception was White Spirit Troupe3, the most powerful assassin group.The strongest assassins of Baek Gwi-ryeon, the Ten Bloodsuckersl (\u5341\u8840\u6bba), was already a legend in Jianghu.\u00a0The main pillars of the current Jianghu are Yigang (\u4e8c\u5f3a), Sammun (\u4e09\u9580), Sampae (\u4e09\u8987),The group of assassins that even the three chieftains were reluctant to face was White Spirit Troupe.The goal of Gu Juyang was to raise the Blood Phantom Group into a group comparable to that of White Spirit Troupe. Until then, being as careful as possible was not enough.\u201cThe Blood Phantom Group will take a massive leap forward if we manage to complete this request. Once we do, it\u2019s not impossible to catch up to White Spirit Troupe.\u201d\u201cHm.\u201dGu Juyang\u2019s\u00a0 eyes were full of ambition. But Sayeol Lim\u2019s eyes, who was looking at him, were slightly shaking with unease.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was not a form commonly seen in Jianghu.\u00a0It was a vicious weapon that was created only to cut off a person\u2019s breath as efficiently as possible.The imagination of humans is so amazing that they can casually create such weapons to kill their fellow human beings.The same dagger was given not only to Pyo-wol, but also to the other children. It was unlike any cheap weapon they had ever used. The weight, strength, and sharpness were all incomparably superior.Although it was their first time using this type of dagger, the children knew how to handle it as if they had been using it for a long time. This was not strange since the children had dealt with numerous weapons in the underground cave.\u00a0Pyo-wol placed the dagger into his bosom.He wanted to throw the weapon away, but if he did, he would be immediately under the surveillance of the Blood Phantom Corps assassins.\u00a0The fact that Pyo-wol preferred to use his bare hands was a secret.Since he has thoroughly learned all the assassination methods using his bare hands, the weapons provided by the instructors ended up being used as decoration.\u00a0Even when the other children were taught by the instructors on how to handle a weapon, he only studied how to effectively kill using his bare hands. To him, utilizing a weapon was cumbersome.\u201cWhat are you thinking so hard about? Kikik!\u201dSo Gyeoksan approached him.As Pyo-wol looked at him silently, So Gyeoksan sat down next to him and continued.\u201cAre you trembling now that we\u2019re going to be on a mission soon?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 to some extent.\u201d\u201cYou son of a bitch, you\u2019re lying again. You? Tremble? I\u2019m sure everyone would laugh at that joke!.\u201d\u00a0Chuckle!\u201cYou seem to be the one trembling. Considering you\u2019re talking a lot more than usual.\u201d\u201cHey! Who\u2019s trembling? I\u2019ve given up fear for a long time. Nothing in this world can scare me.\u201dSo Gyeoksan snorted. He continued his speech by moving the deformed dagger in his hand.\u201cI wish I could be put into the mission soon. I feel like I\u2019ll only be rewarded for all the suffering I\u2019ve endured in the past if I chop someone\u2019s head off.\u201dSo Gyeoksan\u2019s voice was filled with stinky flesh.It was the same with the other children. Although they did not say anything, they too share similar feelings with So Gyeoksan.They feel conflicting emotions of both fear and excitement.Because of that, they were radiating more energies than necessary.Pyo-wol understood their feelings.He, too, was restraining himself from feeling emotions as much as possible, but he was also feeling some excitement to some extent.\u2018The goal is, after all, that Woo Gunsang, right?\u2019He wanted to sneak out and figure out the identity of Woo Gunsang. Doing so might quench the excitement that he was feeling right now.\u00a0Since coming to Clear Wind Manor, he has not seen any other children except the children from the underground cave.\u00a0The Blood Phantom Group thoroughly separated the children to prevent any collision. So Gyeoksan was still next to Pyo-wol and was still talking. But Pyo-wol didn\u2019t listen to him. Treating his chattering as just passing noise.Then a voice came from outside.\u201cGet the equipment you\u2019ve been given and go outside.\u201dPyo-wol and So Gyeoksan looked at each other\u2019s faces, then hurriedly got their gear and ran out. With the two of them in the lead, children from other rooms joined one after another.Familiar faces such as So Yeowol, Lee Min, and Song Cheonwoo gathered in one place.After a while, Gu Juyang appeared.In his hand was a musical instrument.\u00a0A slight tension flashed on the children\u2019s faces.They instinctively noticed that the flute in the hands of Gu Juyang was the instrument that controls the cursed poison hidden in their body.The memories of that time were still vivid in their minds which brought them great fear.\u00a0Gu Juyang looked at the children\u2019s faces one by one and opened his mouth.\u201cFrom now on, you will move secretly to somewhere else. From now on, move according to the Fourth Sword\u2019s orders.\u201dBehind Gu Juyang was a man wearing a mask.He was the strongest swordsman among the Seven Ghost Swords. After the retirement of Lim Sayeol, he served as the de facto head of the Seven Ghost Swords.Gu Juyang handed the Hell Call to the swordsman. The right to decide the life and death of the children was now at the hands of the swordsman.The swordsman\u2019s eyes gleamed fiercely.\u201cThose who disobey my orders will die by my hands. Those who act late will also die. Those who act stupidly will die. So if you don\u2019t want to die, you better act wisely.\u201dThe children\u2019s faces hardened at his threat. He was an assassin on active duty. Hewas incomparable to the three swords who recently retired.Naturally, the degree of coercion felt by the children was different.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dThe swordsman moved first.The children followed him and moved out of the Clear Wind Manor. Then, about a dozen assassins moved together after the children.\u00a0Gu Juyang looked at the children\u2019s backs with cold eyes.The swordsman and the children moved in the dark.Sasak!In the pitch-black darkness, only the rustling of the blades of grass resounded.The swordsman couldn\u2019t help but admire the children who followed him without falling behind.\u2018The senior brothers raised them well.\u2019As an assassin who had reached a high level, he could guess the level of the children just by the sound of their breath and the slightest movement.The children had achieved incredible growth at such a young age.His conjecture was confirmed by the fact that as many as twenty-eight children were moving together yet not a single footstep was heard.None of the children fall behind the regular assassins of the Blood Phantom Group.\u00a0Rather, some appeared to be even superior.He suddenly felt that it was a waste, but he deliberately tried not to think more than that.\u00a0After all, the children have to be only used once and thrown away after. They were different from the existing assassins who belonged to the Bloody Phantom Group. There was no need for affection, no reason to feel pity for them.\u00a0By the time they reached their destination, it was already dawn. They ran all night.\u00a0The place they arrived at was a small hillside. From there, a large mountain was clearly visible in the distance. The huge mountain with numerous mountain peaks connected like a blue castle overwhelms the viewer.Even the clouds could not cross the mountain, and they were spinning around their waists.The children were overwhelmed by its immense majesty.Pyo-wol was no different from the children.Even when he wandered the world before becoming an assassin, he had never seen such a huge mountain.\u2018Our objective lies in those mountains.\u2019Pyo-wol had an intuition that the huge mountain in front of him was his final destination. The existence of Woo Gunsang is probably somewhere in that mountain.The swordsman ordered the children.\u201cEveryone, hide yourselves here.\u201dAs soon as his command was given, the children dug into the ground like moles and hid.The voice of the Fourth Sword was heard through the ears of the children who were hiding in the hideout disguised as leaves.\u201cYour target is on that mountain. If you climb the mountain as per my instructions, you will find a manor that looks exactly as the one you were all living in before. Among the buildings, the man inside the Bright Moon Palace is your target.\u201d\u00a0The voice ended.\u00a0It was then that the children realized the truth of why they had been trained in the underground cavity.Bright Moon Palace is a small house on the outskirts of a manor.\u00a0The road leading to Bright Moon Palace was already well memorized. The children were not afraid to infiltrate Bright Moon Palace.\u00a0They were just curious. They were wondering on who could be the person inside the Bright Moon Palace for them to spend the whole seven years in the underground cave to be raised as assassins.\u00a0Only Pyo-wol knew the person inside Bright Moon Palace.\u2018Woo Gunsang\u2026!\u2019* * *The woman was beautiful.She wasn\u2019t very tall, but her skin was as pale as snow, and her long, hanging hair was as shiny as silk and was dark as pitch black.Her eyelashes were very long when they were slightly lowered, and the eyes set below them were black and clear and seemed to clear the heart of the viewer.The woman wore a light blue top engraved with a peacock feather pattern, and a waist skirt was layered over the lower skirt, which was elegant and attractive.The woman walked alone in the flower garden in full bloom.The garden, which has been nurtured with great care by skilled gardeners for many years, is reminiscent of the kingdom of heaven, with numerous flowers blooming in harmony.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dThe woman suddenly sighed.Her face was full of sorrow.The woman reached out her white hand and caressed a blooming flower.Pssh!She said she was careful to touch it, but the petals crumbled in an instant and turned into dust.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dIt was the second time for the woman to sigh as she raised her hand.An old woman who appeared to be in her sixties entered the garden.She was an impressive old woman with a gray robe reminiscent of a jackdaw and her bubbly eyes. The whole body of the old woman walking in with the monster in her hand as a staff felt a tremendous sense of intimidation.As soon as she saw the old woman, the woman bowed her head.\u201cMaster!\u201d\u201cAre you alone again, Seol-ran?\u201d\u201cI was outside because the breeze felt so nice.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re needlessly sentimental as always.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been working hard all this time. Can\u2019t I use this amount of free time?\u201dAn ordinary person would not be able to raise their voice just by looking at the old woman\u2019s eyes, but the woman answered with a calm expression without any sign of nervousness.\u00a0\u201cDo you still resent me?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t resent you. My life is on the line for this, so I would have liked it if you excused me from it..\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re taking quite the high and mighty tone. I have fucking brought you in when you were just a child begging on the streets. I have washed, fed you good food, and even taught you the very martial arts that made you who you are today. And after all that, you want to be excused?!\u201dThe eyes of the old woman over sixty shone more fiercer than that of a tiger.The woman frowned slightly.The old woman\u2019s eyes did not threaten the woman at all. But the old woman was her master.Had it not been for the old woman, the woman might have died of starvation, or she might have been living a miserable life as a plaything for a rich man.No matter what the old woman\u2019s intentions were, the fact that she had received grace did not change.That was the only reason the woman followed the old woman.\u201cWell, it\u2019s just a thought. If it\u2019s the master\u2019s order, of course, the disciples must follow it. So, don\u2019t be too upset. It\u2019s harmful to your health.\u201dThe old woman\u2019s eyes grew more fierce at the woman\u2019s words. However, the woman\u2019s expression still did not change. Seeing such a woman, the old woman wrinkled the tip of her nose.The only person to whom her dignity did not work was the woman. Everyone is afraid of the old woman, but she is the only one who doesn\u2019t mind.Of course, there were talents and abilities to do that, but the barrier was the biggest. So it made her feel even more sad.The fact that a woman cannot be appointed as a legitimate heir, and that she has no choice but to be used as a political tool.The woman asked the old woman.\u201cIs it today?\u201d\u201cYes. If they don\u2019t give a definite answer by today, we\u2019ll have to carry out the plan we\u2019ve prepared.\u201d\u201cBut that would put a lot of pressure on us.\u201d\u201cWould we have prepared for the next seven years without that much pressure? You just have to follow the directions of this master.\u201d\u201cOf course, I\u2019m always ready to follow Master.\u201dDespite the woman\u2019s somewhat sarcastic tone, the old woman did not get angry.Today was a very important day for the old woman.Because of that, she hasn\u2019t slept properly since last night, and her eyes were red and bloodshot.It was the first time since she became the owner of a clan that she felt such a burden.\u2018How pitiful.\u2019The woman looked at the old woman and gave her sad eyes.That was then.\u201cMaster!\u201dWith a loud noise, a woman who appeared to be in her early to mid forties ran into the garden.Flowers were trampled on and scattered by her rough steps, but she didn\u2019t care.A woman in her forties arrived in front of an old woman and a woman in an instant. The woman in her forties bowed down to give her greetings and said to the old woman.\u201cMaster! I got a call from them.\u201d\u201cReally? What did they say?\u201d\u201cThey came up with the offer we wanted.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s done!\u201dThud!All of a sudden, the old woman pounded the floor with her cane.The impact dented the floor, and numerous petals flew into the sky.The old woman\u2019s face had a young light of excitement, but the opposite shade was cast on the woman\u2019s face.\u2018After all, this is what it is.\u2019This determined the woman\u2019s fate.The old woman looked at the woman.\u201cFrom now on, you have to do well. The fate of the sect depends on what you do.\u201d\u201cPlease do not worry. I will do well.\u201dThe woman struggled to hide her feelings and spoke calmly.Even the old woman knew her feelings. But she chose to ignore it. The burden she carried was too great to understand the student\u2019s private feelings and take care of the situation.Then a woman in her forties interrupted their conversation.\u201cBut there is one problem.\u201d\u201cProblem? Oh!\u201dThe old woman\u2019s expression contorted.Even so, the wrinkled face looked even more ugly.\u201cIs today that day?\u201d\u201cYes! How do we deal with that matter?\u201dThe old woman\u2019s expression hardened at the disciple\u2019s question.\u201cHmm!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They can rest more comfortably when they are in a dark space like this.In fact, Pyo-wol slept comfortably while hiding. Thanks to it, he was in excellent shape.An ordinary person would not be able to feel the passage of time if they were in the dark like this, but Pyo-wol knew exactly how much time had passed.Using his intuition, less than a day must have passed.\u2018Afternoon?\u2019A light of suspicion appeared on his face.It was around evening when they got here yesterday. A day has passed, and now it will be noon. If they were going to execute a sneak attack, they should have done so last night.Because the best way to hide assassins was during the night.An assassination in broad daylight was bound to be a great burden on the assassin. Even for an assassin with excellent stealth skills, it was not easy to completely hide during the day, and it required several times the effort compared to at night.\u2018Then are we going to do it tonight?\u2019He thought that might be the case.It was not a big deal for the children to hide and not move for a day or two.Still, he felt strangely reluctant.\u00a0The children together with the Fourth Sword and other assassins were all spread out hiding their presence. It should be normal for the area to be this quiet. However, Pyo-wol felt that something was off.\u00a0He could feel something ominous.Even in the underground cavity, many children died whenever he felt this way.\u00a0That was then.Puuc!Suddenly a spear pierced through the ground where he had been hiding.Pyo-wol avoided the spear by twisting his body. But not everyone was so lucky.\u201cKeugh!\u201dA scream erupted from the mouth of the child hiding right next to him.There was a long spear stuck in his chest.Pyo-wol shouted as he kicked out the dirt.\u201cIt\u2019s an attack!\u201dThe children ran out of their hiding place as soon as his cry rang out. The first thing they saw when they came out was a group of soldiers armed with swords and spears.They encircled the hillside where Pyo-wol and the children were hiding.\u201cW-What?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dThe children, who did not understand the situation, have a bewildered expression. In the meantime, a soldier pulled out a spear that had been stabbed into the floor. A body of a child who had been stabbed to death came out.\u00a0\u201cIt was true. Assassins were hiding here.\u201dHe muttered as he swung his spear and tossed the body of the dead child in the distance.\u201cHow dare you assassins hide around Qingcheng Mountain? You must not value your lives.\u201dThe man with the spear is named Yoo Jin-ok.He came from the Qingcheng sect, and was a military man who ran the Jinseong Military Academy.Yoo Jin-ok pointed at the children with a spear and shouted.\u201cThey have come to attack the Qingcheng sect. Don\u2019t miss a single one and kill them all!\u201d\u201cYes, sir!\u201dThe soldiers who were besieging the hillside rushed towards the children all at once.\u201cWhat happened? Why are they\u2026\u201d\u201cDisperse! We\u2019ll regroup once we get out of the encirclement.\u201dWhen the children could not properly judge on what to do, So Yeowol gave the order.At that moment, the children who came to their senses scattered all over the place.\u2018We\u2019re at a disadvantage!\u2019Pyo-wol also ran away and checked the situation. It was not known exactly how many soldiers were besieging the place.There were only about a hundred people that were visible. If they include the people in hiding, it could have been several times more.Yoo Jin-ok was a man who was unusually good with a spear. That is why the soldiers of Yoo Jin-ok were also excellent at using the spears. Against assassins who mainly use a short dagger as their main weapon, the spear posed a challenge.\u00a0Another bigger problem was that their hideout is exposed and there is nowhere for them to hide.Assassins showed their greatest power when they utilized the darkness when they attacked. This face-to-face confrontation in broad daylight was inevitably disadvantageous to the children.\u201cEuk!\u201d\u201cKargh!\u201dThe children were not able to respond quickly to the situation and thus were beaten by the soldiers until they collapsed.\u00a0 The children who died couldn\u2019t even close their eyes properly because they could not react in time.\u00a0The soldiers also rushed to Pyo-wol.Shhhhhh!Their spears went flying towards Pyo-wol from a distance. Pyo-wol\u2019s body shook for a moment before he approached through the narrow gap in between the two soldiers.\u00a0\u201cHeup!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThe soldiers, who did not know that Pyo-wol would approach them like this, looked surprised.Quaddok!Pyo-wol grabbed the man who was closest to him and snapped his head to the side. The man\u2019s neck was broken with a horrific bursting sound before dying.\u00a0\u201cHe killed one!\u201d\u201cDie!\u201dThe soldiers, who had unexpectedly lost one of their comrades, hurriedly swung their spears and attacked Pyo-wol. However, Pyo-wol had already kicked off the dead man and flew into the forest.Pyo-wol had no intention of confronting the soldiers head on here.Breaking through the siege was an urgent task.Looking sideways while flying, he saw So Yeowol and several other children breaking through the siege and escaping.Pyo-wol increased his speed.\u00a0\u201cFind them!\u201d\u201cDo not miss a single one!\u201dThose who surrounded the children were not just the soldiers of Jinseong Military. There were also many warriors who used different kinds of martials arts.\u00a0They continue to attack the children mercilessly. The children did their best to break through the unexpected siege. Still, more children died than those who implemented the siege.\u201cLord, I don\u2019t want to die\u2014\u201d\u201cWhat did we do wrong?\u201dTears flowed from the eyes of the wounded and dying children.They didn\u2019t do anything wrong. At least after going out into the world.\u00a0They felt aggrieved and indignant with the way they\u2019re going to die.\u00a0\u201cThose assassins dare to cross the prestigious Qingcheng sect! That alone is enough reason for all of you to die!\u201d\u201cThere is no place for an assassin to set foot on this land!\u201dMadness was visible on the faces of the soldiers who killed children. They slaughtered them mercilessly.Pyo-wol climbed up the tree to gain height. Then he hopped from one tree to another like a squirrel while simultaneously avoiding the attacks of the soldiers.\u00a0A few soldiers who discovered Pyo-wol even tried to climb up the tree, but could not keep up with his pace.\u2018We must move quickly to a safe place.\u2019Phat!Pyo-wol finally broke through the encirclement.He gained quite a few injuries in the process, but nothing fatal. Pyo-wol ignored the pain he felt throughout his body.The important thing now was to get away from here.\u00a0Pyo-wol thought as he ran as fast as he could.\u2018What happened?\u2019They obviously moved in secret. On the way to the mountain, they never met a single person. So, their tracks weren\u2019t supposed to be exposed.Pyo-wol remembered Yoo Jin-ok\u2019s words.\u201cIt was true. Assassins were hiding here.\u201dHe clearly said so.This meant that the group of soldiers attacked after receiving information that Pyo-wol and the children were hiding here.Someone leaked information beforehand.\u2018Who leaked the information?\u2019Except for Pyo-wol, the children did not know who the assassination target was.They haven\u2019t had any contact with anyone since they came out to the outside world. In other words, there was no possibility that the children had leaked information.Then there were two cases left.\u2018It was leaked from the Blood Phantom Corps, or the person who commissioned the assassination leaked the information on purpose.\u2019Pyo-wol bit his lip.Psh!At that moment, a sharp cracking sound rang out.\u00a0Pyo-wol almost instinctively twisted his body and kicked himself out of where he was staying.\u00a0Peuck!At that moment, a flurry of spears was stuck at the location where he was just a moment ago.Someone made a surprise attack.\u00a0\u201cThis way!\u201dThe man who threw the rain of weapons shouted loudly. Then the soldiers who were nearby came rushing in.\u201cCatch him!\u201d\u201cEach assassin has to be caught!\u201dThe warriors chased after Pyo-wol like hunting dogs.Pyo-wol flew away from them.Although the momentum of the warriors was fierce, there was nothing that could not be fought if they made up their mind. In his heart, Pyo-wol wanted to fight too.But if he fights here, he will eventually get caught.He didn\u2019t even know how many enemies there were, so he could not afford to waste time in a place like this.Pyo-wol ran like crazy. He thought he would have shaken them off by this time, but soldiers suddenly came out of nowhere and attacked him.\u2018Is this the Net of Heaven (\u5929\u7f85\u4e4b\u7db2)?\u2019Pyo-wol found it outrageous.\u00a0One day, the desire to catch assassins is spreading, no matter how ignorant Pyo-Wol is, how absurd the current situation is.He knew it wasn\u2019t.\u2018Come to think of it, I don\u2019t see the Fourth Sword and his subordinates.\u2019Even in the midst of a surprise attack, Pyo-wol had a clear grasp of everything around him. With what he has seen in his environment, the Fourth Sword and other assassins was clearly missing.\u00a0\u2018I\u2019m sure they retreated before we were ambushed.\u2019It was clear that they knew in advance that the soldiers would attack. So they went and left them out ahead of time.\u2018I don\u2019t know what the reason is, but the client must have changed his mind, and it became a situation where he can\u2019t afford leaking it out. So he\u2019s trying to destroy the evidence. It will be difficult for him if we succeed in infiltration or if it turns out that we are related to them.\u2019Pyo-wol bit his lip.Whatever the reason, it was clear that they had been abandoned.It was foolish to expect the help of the Blood Phantom Corps.\u00a0He had to get out of here on his own.Pyo-wol looked closely at the surrounding terrain while running at full force.The place he was running was a vast plain with nowhere to hide. He was driven to such an unfavorable place because he was frantically pursued by the soldiers.\u00a0The warriors intentionally pushed Pyo-wol and the children toward the plains. Because this was the most unfavorable environment for assassins.There was not a single place where he could hide. But Pyo-wol did not give up.There is no such thing as perfection in the world.No matter how unfavorable the circumstances were, there was bound to be an opportunity for reversal.At that moment, a faint sound of water reached Pyo-wol\u2019s ear.\u2018There\u2019s a river.\u2019There was nothing more to think about.Pyo-wol ran in the direction of the river.Peuck!\u201cAh!\u201dAt that moment, Pyo-wol\u2019s body shook violently.Suddenly, a long object was lodged in his shoulder.It was an arrow.Someone had shot an arrow at Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol almost fell forward. But he clenched his teeth and got up and ran.There was no time to check who shot the arrow. At this moment, he had to run a little more.Puff peuck!Arrows were shot in succession towards Pyo-wol.\u00a0\u201cShit!\u201dThe man who shot an arrow at Pyo-wol made a face of regret.Jongnisan of Gwimyeon Palace (\u9b3c\u9762\u5f13 Ghost Face Bow) was the name of the warrior. He was a warrior who learned archery, which is rare in Jianghu. He was a master of archery, capable of hitting the head of a sparrow even from a hundred steps away.Three children have already been killed by his arrows.Opportunities to hunt humans openly like this were rare.\u201cYou must be caught by me.\u201dHe spread out his senses and pursued Pyo-wol. The fact that he fired four arrows and only one shot had hit its target hurt his self-esteem.He ran along the trail Pyo-wol left on the ground.\u00a0A master of archery was also a master of light engineering. And he had a knack for tracking.For him, tracking the traces of Pyo-wol was an easy task.Moreover, the arrow he had shot was lodged in Pyo-wol\u2019s shoulder. The blood he had shed had dripped on the floor. Given that the trace was so visible, if he dared to miss it then he is not qualified to be a hunter.He also had to abandon his nickname \u201cGhost Face Bow\u201d.He operated the Cheongheook Simgong (\u9752\u865a\u7389\u5fc3\u529f Qingxu Jade Heart Exercise). The Qingxu Jade Heart Exercise had the ability to maximize his senses. There was no better cultivation technique for an archer who used a bow as a weapon.\u00a0So far, no man has been able to escape from his Qingxu Jade Heart Exercise.\u00a0Jongnisan thought it would be the same this time as well.That was then.The soldiers who were chasing the children from afar suddenly pointed their fingers at him and shouted something.They were too far away for him to hear their voices.\u2018What are they saying now?\u2019Jongnisan saw them pointing their fingers at his back.\u00a0The eyes of Jongnisan opened wide as he unwittingly turned his head to follow the direction where their fingers were pointing,Because someone was following him like a ghost behind his back.It was Pyo-wol that Jongnisan was pursuing.\u201cWhat? You\u2026\u201dHooked!At that moment, Pyo-wol poked his throat with his finger.Pyo-wol\u2019s fingers dig into Jongnisan\u2019s neck as if digging into tofu.\u201cKuagh!\u201dJongnisan vomited blood.He looked at Pyo-Wol with a look of disbelief.It was obviously him who was chasing Pyo-wol. He was on the lookout using the Qingxu Jade Heart Exercise, but he couldn\u2019t understand how Pyo-wol came back from behind him.\u201cUgh! Uh, how?\u201dPyo-wol couldn\u2019t afford to answer his question.Because his situation was also quite unreasonable. He had to perform both the Thunder-Splitting and Turtle Breathing technique at the same time. There were a lot of loopholes because it was done in a hurry.\u00a0If Jongnisan were a little bit more vigilant, he would definitely have found Pyo-wol. But Jongnisan was too careless. He committed the mistake of tracking only the bloodstains that Pyo-wol deliberately left. So Pyo-wol managed to trick Jongnisan\u2019s senses.\u00a0The price of his carelessness was death.The sight of him being killed was clearly visible to the eyes of the people who looked at it from a distance.Because Jongnisan was a master of tracking and archery, he had to be killed first. Knowing how dangerous these two combinations are, Pyo-wol had no choice but to gamble with his life.The other soldiers continue to be right on his tracks.\u00a0Pyo-wol escaped by jumping into the river.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, he knew the approximate principle of it.\u00a0Pyo-wol used the power of his body as much as possible to operate in the waters.\u00a0Just because he jumped into the water doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t escape their pursuit. Not knowing what kind of danger lurked, he continued to swim away while taking a break from time to time.\u00a0Fortunately, Pyo-wol was very good at this kind of work. The greatest strength of Pyo-wol was not losing his composure no matter how urgent the situation was, and to calmly make a decision on what he had to do first.Pyo-wol thinks that the biggest advantage he had while he was raised in the underground cave was his accelerated thinking. He learned how to think, judge, and make decisions one step ahead of others.Thanks to that, Pyo-wol was always one step ahead of the other children. Right now, there is only one step difference among them, but as time goes by, the gap will widen.If only he would be able to survive right now.\u00a0He had to focus on his survival.\u2018I have to group up with the other kids first.\u2019He didn\u2019t know how many people ended up escaping, so he had to meet the survivors first.It was necessary to meet the other children and share the information they gathered. Only then could he grasp the big picture drawn by the unknown enemy.\u201cPhew!\u201dPyo-wol came out of the water after recovering some of his strength.\u00a0He wanted to hide in a cave where no one could see him and make a bonfire. However, it was impossible to find such a topography in the open plain.Pyo-wol first focused on finding traces of the survivors.For seven years, the children confronted each other to the extreme and tried to kill each other. But oftentimes they collaborated, creating a bond of their own.They created a code for communicating without the instructors knowing. It is a brief description of a language that only they can recognize in graffiti, which can be mistaken for just random scribbling or doodling by strangers.The children rejected Pyo-wol and did not share the secret codes. The children were jealous or afraid of Pyo-wol.\u00a0To them, Pyo-wol was a foreign entity like oil that could not be mixed with water. Some children, including So Yeowol, showed interest, but most of them were reluctant to do so.Even if the children did not teach it to him, Pyo-wol noticed the existence of passwords based on his unique observation skills, and even understood through the language system. But he pretended not to know the secret code. Because he didn\u2019t want to mix with the kids.But things have changed.Disregarding his personal feelings, he had to meet with the other children now.Pyo-wol thought from the children\u2019s point of view.\u2018Shortest escape route, lots of hiding places, sparsely populated places.\u2019Under the assumption that there is no other information, the probability of moving to these three conditions was high. Because that\u2019s how they were trained.\u201cSearch thoroughly.\u201d\u201cThey must have been hiding around here.\u201dThe voices of the soldiers were heard from afar. Pyo-wol had flowed quite far along the river, but the siege was still strong.Pyo-wol passed in between the soldiers who were searching for him by simultaneously practicing the Thunder-Splitting and Turtle Breathing Technique. His appearance was so naturally hidden that the soldiers did not even notice that Pyo-wol was nearby.Pyo-wol paid attention to the clothes of the soldiers.There were four warriors, each with a different outfit.People who belonged to a particular sect had a strong tendency to wear uniform clothes. This is because the clothing establishes the identity of the sect.\u00a0The fact that all four of them wore different clothes meant that they all belonged to a different sect. The uniforms of the soldiers Pyo-wol encountered before he managed to escape to the river were also different.\u2018At least seven sects participated. For them to kill young assassins\u2013\u2019Conceptually, it made no sense.Pyo-wol thought that someone was in charge of the situation now.There was a high probability that it was the person who commissioned the assassination.The question was who commissioned the assassination.In order to find out the truth behind this situation, he had to find the client. Otherwise, he would not know if he would be chased for the rest of his life.Pyo-wol moved in search of the best environment for the other children to hide. And it wasn\u2019t long before he found a small graffiti carved on the bottom of the rock.It was a secret code left by one of the children.\u2018About two hundred sheets to the north.\u2019It wasn\u2019t long before I found a small graffiti carved on the bottom of the rock.It was a password left by one of the children.\u2018About two hundred meters to the north.\u2019Pyo-wol moved to where the secret code was pointing towards. He moved secretly while killing his presence as much as possible. He didn\u2019t know if anyone would be on his trail.If he makes a mistake and his actions are exposed, he will end up being pursued by many warriors. Because of this, it took him more than half an hour to reach the distance of another corner.\u00a0The owner of the secret code was not on the location he previously instructed on the rock. Instead, he left behind another secret code and moved to somewhere else.Pyo-wol looked at the code.\u2018About four hundred meters to the northeast.\u2019Pyo-wol frowned.Again, rather than the fact that he had to travel a long distance, the traces left on the floor went on his nerves.There were traces of black droplets left behind.Pyo-wol knew what that meant.\u2018Is the person injured?\u2019He did not know who the owner of the secret password was, but it was clear that the person was hurt.A minor wound would be nice, but unfortunately, given the amount of blood remaining on the floor, it was highly unlikely.Pyo-wol moved in secret again.Several times along the way, he encountered soldiers who were combing the area. Fortunately, Pyo-wol was able to hide before they could find him. The soldiers were not yet tired and were in hot pursuit of the children.Their appearance was no different from that of a very excited hound.\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s around here.\u201d\u201cSearch for every single one of them.\u201dPyo-wol\u2019s face darkened when he saw them. Because they were wearing clothes he hadn\u2019t seen before.One more was added to the existing seven factions. The problem is that he cannot even guess how many more sects were added in to the mix.\u2018This is the worst.\u2019The soldiers were spread like a huge net as they looked from every corner.\u00a0In other words, escaping would be a far off dream. Since at this rate, they will one day get caught in the net.Before that happens, Pyo-wol has to find the owner of the password. Pyo-wol overcame the risk of being caught several times, and finally arrived at the final destination.Puash!Waiting for him to arrive at his destination was someone\u2019s sneak attack. However, Pyo-wol avoided his sneak attack by a hair\u2019s breadth.\u00a0It was a beautiful girl who silently attacked like a cat. Pyo-wol immediately recognized her identity.\u201cLee Min!\u201dThe girl was just Lee Min.\u00a0\u201cIt was you, Pyo-wol!\u201dLee Min was relieved. However, Pyo-wol\u2019s expression when looking at her was not so bright. It was because he saw that Lee Min\u2019s side was stained red.At a glance, it was clear that she had suffered serious injuries.The bloodstains on the floor were also hers.\u201cLike an idiot\u2014\u2014. What about the other guys?\u201d\u201cMost of them are dead.\u201d\u201cSo Yeowol and Song Cheonwoo too?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened to them.\u201dSo Yeowol and Song Cheonwoo remained fighting until the end to save even one more child. Like a fighting dog, they bit and drooped at those who attacked them.That was the last appearance that Lee Min remembered. Lee Min suffered serious injuries in the process of escaping.The reason she\u2019s still alive is because she\u2019s made full use of all her strengths. Through deceitful acts such as hiding and leaving false traces, she managed to drive here. But in return, she suffered such great wounds and was dying.Pyo-wol sighed softly.\u201cHuu\u2013\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, though.\u201dLee Min smiled wryly.Her complexion was pale. She had lost too much blood.\u00a0Although Pyo-wol had no medical knowledge, he could tell that it was too late to save her. Anyone can see that Lee Min is on the line between life and death.Pyo-wol said as he sat down next to Lee Min.\u00a0\u201cUnless a miracle happens, you will die soon.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dLee Min\u00a0 replied calmly.\u201cAren\u2019t you scare? Don\u2019t you want to live?\u201d\u201cI want to live. Can you save me?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve given up. I already know the state my body is in.\u201d\u201cHuu\u2026\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be sorry. After all, it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d\u201c\u2026right.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m relieved. I won\u2019t have to die all alone. Will you stay with me to the end?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dPyo-wol nodded his head.Lee Min looked at Pyo-wol. Her pale face was full of emotions.\u201cPyo-wol\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cI want you to survive.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d\u201cI hope you survive and get revenge on them in the same way. It\u2019s unfortunate. After everything that we went through to survive\u2026 we have to die like this. It\u2019s tragic that someone I don\u2019t know determines my fate. I hope they feel the same way as me one day.\u201d.Lee Min spoke calmly, but Pyo-wol felt the cry in her voice.In the underground cavity, she fought harder than anyone else to survive.In the underground cavity, she fought more closely than anyone else to stay alive.Even in a world where there was no hope, she was able to not get frustrated because she believed that something would change if she went out to the outside world.Such belief was the driving force that allowed her to endure until now.But that belief was shattered, and only despair was gnawing at her heart.There was no hope or light to be found in her eyes, which used to shone brightly in the dark.She lost the will to live.She no longer had the strength to move forward.It was impossible to save her. However, he didn\u2019t want to let her go in despair like this.Pyo-wol opened his mouth.\u201cLee Min.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to comfort me. It\u2019s not bad to die by your side.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because of Woo Gunsang.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dAt the answer that was different from what she expected, Lee Min made a puzzled expression. But Pyo-wol continued to speak, regardless of her reaction.\u201cOur assassination target was a person named Woo Gunsang. There is a high probability that he is a disciple of the Qingcheng sect. Because the large mountain where we were hiding before was Mount Qingcheng. I\u2019m sure of it. If we go to the mountain, there will probably be a full-scale group just like him.\u201dHe was speaking to Lee Min, but he was also speaking to himself.\u201cI don\u2019t know the reason, but someone had requested the Blood Phantom Corps to kill Woo Gunsang of the Qingcheng sect, and we were kidnapped and raised as assassins for 7 years as a result. The client has a cautious personality. Such a person cannot stick to only one method, maybe they have two, three or more back up plans in mind to achieve the result they wanted. Maybe at the beginning, things didn\u2019t go the way they had hoped, so they told the Blood Phantom Corps to go ahead with the request. But something must have happened before the assassination so they ended up changing their mind. Now that things are like this, there\u2019s no need for us to continue with the assassination.\u201dLee Min listened to Pyo-wol.Her mind was starting to get blurry, but she could hear Pyo-wol\u2019s words strangely and clearly.\u201cThey already got the desired result, so if the assassination ended up being successful, we would actually lose money. That\u2019s why they canceled the request. They leaked the assassination attempt on the Qingcheng sect to the other sects. They tried to erase us by borrowing the hands of the other sect.\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s\u2014that was it.\u201dLee Min nodded helplessly.Her mind was getting more and more cloudy. Still, she tried to listen to Pyo-wol until the end.\u201cThe client is probably a person who the Qingcheng faction knows. If it takes seven years to process the request, it can be seen that he or she has a very tenacious and tenacious personality.\u201dShe didn\u2019t even have the strength to open her mouth anymore.Lee Min helplessly looked at Pyo-wol who was speaking.\u201cThey must have tremendous power and wealth. How many people in Sichuan Province can afford the huge amount of money that goes into abducting and raising helpless orphans from all over Jianghu. I\u2019ll find out soon enough once I survive here.\u201d\u00a0Even in the midst of losing her mind, Lee Min thought that Pyo-wol was scary.To her and the other children, Pyo-wol was a demon from hell itself.They never dared to cross Pyo-wol.Outwardly they seemed to be equal, but in reality, she and the other children continued to be subordinated to the existence of Pyo-wol.Suddenly, she felt pity for those who turned Pyo-wol as an enemy.\u201cIt must have been the gamble of a lifetime for them, and their gamble has been brilliantly successful. Now everything would have been perfect if they got rid of us. How can I watch the person who made us suffer for seven years live and smile well? I can\u2019t stand that.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026 I knew you would\u2026. If it\u2019s you\u2014.\u201dAt Lee Min\u2019s answer, Pyo Wol turned his head and looked at her.Lee Min looked at him and smiled.His eyes were strangely clear.\u201cCan you\u2026 call my name?\u201d\u201cLee Min\u2026\u201d\u201cMy real name\u2026.\u201cLee Seolmin.\u201d\u201cThank you! I wanted to hear it from you.\u201d\u201cSeol\u2026Min.\u201dLee Min did not answer.She did not even move.didn\u2019t even move.Pyo-wol noticed that she was dead.Just as a candle that has reached its end of life shines brightest at the end, Lee Min, too, did her best to hear her real name one last time.Lee Min remained beautiful even though she was injured while hiding.She no longer had a painful expression on her face.Pyo-wol looked at Lee Min\u2019s face without saying a word. The faint ties that had been connected with him were broken.That was then.\u201cIt\u2019s this way. There\u2019s a bloodstain running this way.\u201d\u201cEveryone, come this way.\u201dThe voices of the soldiers who followed the traces of Lee Min were heard.Now it was time to leave.Pyo-wol gently laid Lee Min down and whispered.\u201cI don\u2019t know who planned this, but I\u2019m going to erase them all from the face of this land. So watch over what I do\u2014\u201d\u2026I never realized setting up a website would be so difficult. Had to learn a lot of stuff to make this site presentable. ( ; \u00b4\u0414\uff40) My brain was definitely fried\u2013 nonetheless, I\u2019m quite happy how it turned out~ the site was dark and gloomy before.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 24": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 24Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe base of the Blood Phantom Group was top secret.No matter how much people say that the Blood Phantom Group has a great reputation in Sichuan, in the end they were nothing more than a bunch of assassins.Those who had a grudge against them were as many as the grains of sand by the river.The Blood Phantom Group just accepted requests for the group\u2019s survival, but it made them bear the great resentment from families of those who suffered at their hands.People who wanted to take revenge on the Blood Phantom Group were scattered everywhere. They wanted to tear down and kill the members of the Blood Phantom Group.\u00a0Knowing that fact, the Blood Phantom Group never leaked the location of their base to the outside world. In the end, no one ever knew where the base of the Blood Phantom Group was in Jianghu.\u00a0Most people thought that the base of the Blood Phantom Group would be in a quiet rural village without people or in a green forest. However, contrary to their expectations, the base of the Blood Phantom Group was actually located in the middle of the capital city roadside of Sichuan Province.It was a dull-looking mansion made out of red bricks.People thought of the mansion as just the house of a person who had made some money and retired. A mansion where an ordinary person who\u2019s nothing special lives. That was the general feeling the people around the mansion had.\u00a0The mansion owner\u2019s name is Gu Juyang. Another status of his, aside from being known as a retired person, was the head of the Blood Phantom Group.\u00a0Gu Juyang was listening to the report from the Fourth Sword at his residence.\u201c\u2013Only me and my subordinates managed to secretly escape. \u201c\u201cAnd the children?\u201d\u201cThe inescapable net has been used. Is it not impossible for them to get out?\u201d\u201cWhat a pity! They were raised with care, but they ended up being thrown away like that.\u201dGu Juyang clicked his tongue.There was an expression of genuine regret on his face. This was because the children were so talented. He thought the children were a hand he could just throw away, but he never expected that they would immediately be discarded without being even able to use them.\u00a0He looked at the letter on the desk.There was only one word in the letter.[Canceled.]It meant that all operations were abolished.The person who sent the letter was the client who had originally requested the assassination.As soon as he received the letter, Gu Juyang ordered the Fourth Sword and the regular assassins to secretly escape. The children did not notice their escape because they were immersed in their hiding with their Turtle Breathing Technique spread out.Right after the Fourth Sword and his subordinate assassins escaped, the inescapable net unfolded.Even the use of the inescapable net was unexpected.It would have been impossible for the Fourth Sword and his subordinates to escape if the inescapable net had been fully activated.Fourth Sword said,\u00a0\u201cIsn\u2019t this place in danger as well?\u201d\u201cBecause of the client?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know why, but they chose to kill and destroy the evidence. Wouldn\u2019t it be much safer for them to get rid of us as well if they wanted to perfectly keep their secret from getting out?\u201d\u201cThat makes sense. But they\u2019ll never be able to find this place. It\u2019s impossible for them to find us in the normal way.\u201dThis was not the only base of the Blood Phantom Group that existed.\u00a0There was one house about fifty steps to the north, and another house about seventy steps to the west. It wasn\u2019t just a single house in the area.\u00a0Everyone in those houses was owned by people who had nothing to do with the Blood Phantom Group. And it was connected to this place through an underground passage.If an unfamiliar enemy appeared, they could escape at any time through the basement.No matter how smart an enemy might be, he would not be able to think of the houses to be in connection with the Blood Phantom Group.\u201cWe just have to wait here for the storm to blow over. I don\u2019t want to make the problem bigger by being hasty.\u201d\u201cYou really don\u2019t know the identity of the client?\u201d\u201cIf you want to know, you can always know, but you have to keep the line.\u201dGu Juyang grabbed the letter and shook it.In an instant, the Fourth sword smelled a strange smell.By shaking the letter, it emitted a strange scent.In an instant, his complexion changed.\u201cIt\u2019s tracking incense!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cSomeone has placed a tracking incense in the letter!\u201dIt was such a subtle scent that he would never have been able to smell it if Gu Juyang had not shaken the letter. The Fourth Sword\u2019s sense of smell was so developed so that was why he could smell it, if it were just an average person, they wouldn\u2019t even have noticed that it had such a scent.Even Gu Juyang, who is extremely cautious, didn\u2019t even notice that there was a trace of tracking incense in the letter.\u201cWho? Maybe the client?\u201dIt was the moment when Gu Juyang jumped up.\u201cArgh!\u201d\u201cKeugh!\u201dThe screams of assassins erupted from outside.Gu Juyang and the Fourth Sword rushed towards the sound.The scenery they saw was that of a group of soldiers breaking into the mansion and mercilessly slaughtering their assassins.All those working in the mansion were assassins.On the surface, they looked like ordinary workers, but each one of them was a very talented person. Such great assassins were falling apart without much effort.Bang!\u201cKerhyuk!\u201dOne of the intruders swung their bare fists, and the sound of iron cannons being fired reverberated. And the assassin of the Bloody Phantom Group was crushed like fish meat and died. It was that powerful.\u201cAll of you retreat! You\u2019re no match!\u201dThere was one who struggled alone.It was the First Sword, Lim Sayeol.\u00a0He tried to extend himself by holding onto one of his enemies to save even one assassin. However, even with his abilities, he was unable to properly kill an intruder.The ability of the intruders was that much stronger.Bald-shaven hair, gray robes, and beads around their necks stood out.\u00a0Monks.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t just the monks. There were also people in ordinary uniforms.The assassins of the Blood Phantom Group were also experienced warriors who had gone through different battles since birth, but they were no match for the warriors.Besides, it was the middle of the day now.This is not the best time for assassins.\u201cSweep away those dirty assassins, leave no one behind!\u201d\u201cStart the killing!\u201dThe monks pushed forward with a more frightening force.The corpses of assassins started to pile up everywhere.\u201cRun away, Captain!\u201dThe Fourth Sword grabbed Gu Juyang\u2019s arm and dragged him away.\u201cWhere to?\u201d\u201cAnywhere!\u201d\u201cHa! Don\u2019t you see? It\u2019s me who they\u2019re after. Since they came after me, do you think they would leave a place where I can escape?\u201dFlames seemed to burn in Gu Juyang\u2019s eyes.Kkadeuk!He gritted his teeth.\u00a0He knew it without checking the identity of the intruder.The client began to make a move.\u201cYou\u2019re crossing the line\u2026\u201dHis eyes came bloodshot.Even between the assassin and the client, there was a line that had to be kept.They crossed the line a long time ago.Gu Juyang pulled out the sword he was wearing on his waist.It was the Blood Moon Knife.\u00a0\u201cSir, we can still step back\u2014\u201d\u201cHow far will we retreat? Can\u2019t you see? They attacked us with such determination. There\u2019s no way we can escape.\u201dThe Fourth Sword couldn\u2019t answer.Gu Juyang shook off the hand of the dead sword and stepped forward.\u201cNow is the time to show them. That they will be the ones to be devoured if they bite us.\u201dHis eyes gleamed eerily.He knew it was an unfavorable fight. But he still had to fight.Chaaat!Go Juyang flew towards the intruders along with the Blood Moon Knife.\u00a0His sword was long and sharp. Although he usually does not use swordsmanship techniques, he did his best to overcome the unfavorable situation.\u201cKak!\u201dA young monk lost his life in the blood of Gu Juyang.One-of-a-kind blood spots \uc77c\ub3c4\ud544\uc0b4(\u4e00\u5200\u5fc5\u6bba) \ud608\uc810\ud754(\u8840\u8cbc\u75d5).\u00a0Wherever he wielded his sword, a corpse always appeared, leaving traces of drops of blood.Although he had not been active in the front line for a long time, his method of killing was still powerful.When he and the Fourth Sword joined, the battlefield shook violently.The assassins regained their composure and began to deal with the monks while taking advantage of the terrain. Then, the momentum of the soldiers who had initially been pushing wildly slowed down a bit.\u201cEveryone, hold on a little more! If we hold out, we can win!\u201dGu Juyang fought hard while encouraging the assassins.\u201cYou won\u2019t have a chance to do that.\u201dHuung!At that moment, along with the woman\u2019s cold voice, a great energy flew by.Kaang!Gu Juyang tried to protect his whole body by swinging the Blood Moon Knife. Fortunately, he was spared from being seriously injured, but the complexion of Gu Juyang noticeably became pale. His internal organs were shaken by the shock.\u201cWho are you?\u201dGu Juyang shouted, forcing himself to swallow the blood that was welling up to his throat.\u201cHow dare a lowly assassin ask for my name?\u201dA woman in her forties jumped over the fence and landed in front of Gu Juyang. Her overall appearance was beautiful, but the raised corners of the eyebrows looked very poisonous.The woman glared at Gu Juyang with fierce eyes.The expression on Gu Juyang\u2019s face darkened at the unusual momentum of the woman.\u201cYou\u2014\u201dGu Juyang recognized the woman\u2019s identity at a glance.At least among the famous warriors in Sichuan, there was no one whom he did not know.\u201cJeonghwa, the life ending toxic heart. Why? Then could the client be\u2014\u201d\u201cStop right there! If your mouth say anything more, I will pull out your tongue.\u201dShe exclaimed as she pulled out a fire-jin from her waist.\u00a0In an instant, a shadow fell on the corner of Gu Juyang\u2019s eyes.\u2018I wonder if that was the place where I made the request. It must be difficult to get out of bad luck.\u2019Jeonghwa was by no means an ordinary warrior.Although he was also a martial artist, they were famous for their meticulous yet vicious hearts.At the very least, wouldn\u2019t even a special title be the number one read?But what was truly terrifying was not Jeonghwa.\u00a0It was Jeonghwa\u2019s background which was terrifying.Only then did Gu Juyang know the true client who sent such an unreasonable request to the Blood Phantom Group.\u00a0A light of fear flashed across his eyes.Although he had little to fear in the world, he was wary of the person behind Jeonghwa.\u2018I should have thought that they were related\u2013\u2019Gu Juyang blamed his complacency for not recognizing the identity of the client in hopes of not crossing the line.\u00a0All this catastrophe today was the result of his own mistake.\u00a0If they were involved, even if the assassination was successful, their annihilation would surely follow.\u201cMy wrong judgment has brought forth a disaster. But even if I die, I will never die alone!\u201dGu Juyang shouted loudly and ran towards Jeonghwa.He held the Blood Moon Knife in his hand, and a reddish black aura continued to stretch out. Even in front of the sword that dyed the entire surroundings red, Jeonghwa\u2019s expression did not change.\u201cHeh! A mere assassin?She swung her weapon.\u00a0 Then a storm-like aura arose and counteracted the energy from Gu Juyang\u2019s knife.\u00a0Kakakang!Blood Moon Knife and Buljin (weapon of Jeonghwa) collided over and over again.Gu Juyang did his best.If he couldn\u2019t subdue Jeonghwa today, then there would be no future for him.Jeonghwa\u2019s weapon was pushed back little by little by his energy.\u00a0A light of admiration flashed across her face.\u2018The leader of an assassin group possesses such a level of martial art\u2026 Impressive.\u2019From an early age, she steadily learned the martial arts of a prestigious sect. She may not be regarded as a great genius, but she has steadily learned the wisdom taught by her master and has become a master recognized by the four natures.Even with her martial arts, the captain of the Blood Phantom Group was so good that she couldn\u2019t subdue him in just a short time.Fortunately, their battle was a face-to-face confrontation in broad daylight.Jeonghwa realized once again that Gu Juyang and the other Blood Phantom Group assassins had to be annihilated.\u201cDie!\u201dJeonghwa performed Daejung Sungong [\ub300\uc815\uc120\uacf5(\u5927\u9759\u5f3e\u529f), which contains the secrets of Pasa [\ud30c\uc0ac(\u7834\u90aa)].It was an attack injected with internal energy.Gu Juyang was not confident enough to face her attack head-on, so he tried to avoid it.Pit!At that moment, something tiny flew and pierced his ankle. Jeonghwa\u2019s comrade had attacked him.\u00a0 Gu Juyang, who was very nervous about the confrontation with Jeonghwa, could not avoid the sneak attack.Gu Juyang\u2019s balance was broken because of the wound in his ankle. And the fire-jin that contains Jeonghwa\u2019s powerful internal energy exploded in his body.Bang!\u201cKeugh!\u201dWith a scream, Gu Juyang\u2019s body collapsed.In that one attack, Gu Juyang could not counterattack in time.\u00a0His chest was hollow, as if he had been struck by a large sledgehammer.\u201cKekkeuk!\u201dGu Juyang lay on the floor and took a deep breath.\u201cHeuk!\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201dWhen he collapsed, the other assassins who had also been struggling with him also began to collapse rapidly.As the fight continued for a bit, monks and warriors slaughtered the assassins more explosively.\u2018Oh, no!\u2019Gu Juyang shed tears of blood as he watched the collapse of the Blood Phantom Group.\u00a0Pak! Pak!Then there was a loud sound of footsteps.Jeonghwa took a step towards the owner of the footprints.\u201cYour disciple, Jeonghwa is greeting Master.\u201d\u201cHow much time are you wasting to subdue such lowly assassins?\u201d\u201cI apologize, master! It took a while because they resisted a lot more than I expected.\u201dIt was an old woman reminiscent of a crow.The whole body of the old woman who was walking with a staff brought great momentum.The old woman looked down at Gu Juyang with cold eyes.Gu Juyang shouted at the old woman.\u201cElderly Master of Brilliance (\u4e5d\u934b\u5e2b\u592a)! How can you do this to me? How could the Emei Sect do this to the Blood Phantom Group\u2026?!

Due to the long seclusion, the members of the clan were poor.There were some formidable warriors such as Baekwol Samseung2\u00a0who\u2019s stronger than Guhwasata, but unfortunately, her political power and sense of reality were not up to par.She focused on learning martial arts rather than expanding the influence of the clan. As she did not accept an external disciple, the Emei sect naturally declined.When Baekwol Samseung realized that fact, the Emei sect had shrunk to nothing. Even if she died and reincarnated with her powers, she could not lead the revival of the Emei sect.\u00a0So the one who was chosen to become the sect leader was Guhwasata.In the case of the Guhwasata, her martial arts might be mediocre, but her sense of reality and leadership was outstanding. With her overwhelming presence, she was supported by her students.When she became the head, Guhwasata boldly opened their gates and began to accept disciples from the outside.The Emei sect was originally an exclusive sect where an overwhelming number of its members were female monks.In Jianghu, more than two-thirds of the prominent characters were men. This was because it was physically more advantageous for men to learn martial arts.\u00a0So with that, she had to choose a disciple among the leftover population of less than one-thirds in Jianghu, but even then, most women did not want to become monks.Because of that, the Emei sect had to struggle with lack of members. That was one of the reasons for the rapid decline of the Emei sect.\u00a0After identifying all these problems, Guhwasata decided to boldly open their doors to everyone.She selected talented disciples from among men as well as women. In addition, the restriction that only one great disciple must become a monk was also lifted.The biggest obstacle that prevented the influx of talented members was removed.Even Guhwasata herself changed.This was because if the sect leader herself was a monk, external members would have a preconceived notion that the Emei sect was an exclusive clan. After that, the Emei sect began to expand rapidly.At present, the Emei sect was closer to a secular sect than a Buddhist sect.All of these changes were the achievements of Guhwasata.\u00a0Guhwasata was the vanguard that destroyed all the elements that had defined the Emei sect for hundreds of years.Even though her staff was covered with the blood of Gu Juyang, she did not even blink an eye.Guhwasa looked around the inside of the mansion with cool eyes.Screams were resounding everywhere.Most of them belonged to assassins.The assassins were helpless in the face of the formidable force of the Emei disciples. When the Captain, Gu Juyang died, their power and spirit further weakened.\u201cKggh!\u201dHe knelt down with a single sword pierced through his chest.In front of him stood a dazzlingly beautiful woman. She was the master of the sword that pierced the chest of the First sword.The woman was wearing a pale blue top with a peacock feather print on it. First sword thought that the peacock pattern went well with her gorgeous appearance.\u201cWhat is your name\u2026?\u201d\u201cYong\u2026Seol-ran.\u201d\u201cI heard that among the disciples of Elderly Master, there is a disciple whose appearance is like that of a fairy and has a talent that pierces the sky\u2026 it must have been you.\u201d\u201cThose are all just exaggerated rumors.\u201dYong Seol-ran shook her head slightly.The First Sword thought that she was beautiful.\u201cHa\u2026hah! I guess being an assassin for decades was useless.\u201d\u00a0He felt that decades of his life had been denied.First sword died in despair.Yong Seol-ran looked at the First Sword with sad eyes for a moment, and then moved towards the GuhwasataAround the Guhwasata, all the great disciples of the Emei Sect had gathered.Jeonghwa, Cheolsim, Doyeon, Dansim, Unmong.All of them were direct disciples of the Guhwasata and the senior sisters of Yong Seol-ran.As the Yong Seol-ran approached, Jeonghwa opened her mouth.\u201cYou\u2019re late, youngest. What kind of conversation did you have with an assassin?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, senior sister.\u201dYong Seol-ran replied calmly.Jeonghwa\u2019s eyebrows twitched slightly at Yong Seol-ran\u2019s attitude. However, she didn\u2019t say anything more because it was in front of the Guhwsata.\u00a0Yong Seol-ran was a very important figure in the Emei sect in many ways.\u00a0She would be playing the largest role in the future plans of the Guhwasata. So Jeonghwa couldn\u2019t treat her like that.That was then.Two of the Emei sect\u2019s disciples dragged a person in the front of Jeonghwa.\u00a0It was the Fourth Sword who had both of his arms and legs cut off. The Emei disciples threw the Fourth Sword in front of Jeonghwa as if he was trash.\u201cThis is the person in charge of leading the newly trained assassins to the vicinity of Qingcheng mountain.\u201dGuhwasata looked at the Fourth Sword with contemptuous eyes.The kind of people she hated the most were the assassins. Humans who only need money to kill and do not need any other cause or justification.\u00a0Assassins were the most unworthy of living among the many types of human beings in the world.\u201cExactly how many assassins did you take with you?\u201d\u201cUgh! Why do you ask\u2026?\u201dThe Fourth sword could barely raise his blood-stained face and looked at the Elderly Master.\u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t need to know why. Just answer the question.\u201d\u201cHuh! I don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cAre you lying to me?\u201d\u201cEven if I know, I can\u2019t tell you. You don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to tell the truth to the person that made our base this way, do you?\u201d\u201cHeh! A mere assassin dared to pretend to be quite strong.\u201dGuhwasata snorted and stretched out her hand.Her wrists, reminiscent of an old tree, were exposed.She grabbed the Fourth Sword\u2019s wrist with her fingers.\u00a0Chuhongyeong-gigong.3\u00a0It was one of the Emei sect\u2019s best martial arts.It was a kind of penetration which boasted a more brutal and vicious power than any other torture method. It was said that those who suffered from the said technique would end up having their entire body paralyzed while enduring a hell-like suffering.\u00a0As if gnawed at by an insect, the body and mind would be cut off and the person would end up suffering extreme pain until death.\u201cAGRH!\u201dThe Fourth sword screamed.He was an assassin who had gone through all sorts of battles.The Chuhongyeong-gigong was so painful that he, who did not even blink an eye from any kind of torture, let out a devastating scream.It wasn\u2019t just the pain of an animal scratching his flesh. As if hot candle wax was poured along his blood vessels, the pain that melted and hardened the whole body made the Fourth sword felt extreme pain.\u00a0The pain was so severe that his body ended up being twisted in a bizarre angle, even though all the muscles in his limbs had already been cut off.At the terrible appearance, the disciples of Emei, including Jeonghwa, turned their heads away. Guhwasata did not flinch and continued to torture the Fourth Sword using the Chuhongyeong-gigong.In the end, the Fourth Sword could not endure the pain and succumbed.\u201cTwenty\u2026ei\u2026ght. N..Now ki-kill\u2014\u201d\u201cHmph.\u201dAfter hearing the desired answer, Guhwasata took her hand off from the body of the Fourth Sword.\u00a0The Fourth Sword was still alive.He was still breathing, but he was better off dead.Chuhongyeong-gigong completely destroyed the inside of his body and continued to inflict extreme pain. The Fourth sword had felt the pain vividly until he stopped breathing.Guhwasata\u2019s gaze turned to Jeonghwa.\u201cHow many people have you killed so far?\u201d\u201cTwenty-four people.\u201d\u201cThere are four people left. I want to get rid of all the variables.\u201d\u201cBy your order!\u201dAs Jeonghwa left with the answer, Guhwasata looked at the Yong Seol-ran.\u00a0\u201cSeol-ran, your role from now on is crucial. You know that, right?\u201d\u201cYes, master.\u201d\u201cAs soon as this case is settled, I will send someone to the Qingcheng sect to set a date. Until then, prepare your heart and body for the wedding.\u201d\u00a0\u201cYes, master.\u201dYong Seol-ran answered briefly. Her attitude was a little annoying, but Guhwasata did not bother to scold her.\u00a0Instead, she said something to herself.\u201cEverything is for the sake of the sect\u201d* * *The War of Demons and Heaven4\u00a0brought a great change to the ruling system of the Jianghu. As many sects collapsed and new sects emerged, abrupt changes took place in the topographical map of Jianghu.The sects that participated in the War of Demons and Heaven experienced explosive growth with the support of the world, while the clans who did not join the war face difficulties.The sects of Sichuan belonged to the latter. Sichuan Province was less influenced by foreign powers because of its closed topography. Since they were not influenced by the outside world, there was no reason to go out of their way to participate in the Great War.\u00a0Once established in an isolated environment, the hierarchy of the sects did not change easily.After the fall of the Tang sect, the leadership of Sichuan Province was held by the Emei sect and the Qingcheng sect. Between the two, it was the Qingcheng sect that took the lead.This was largely due to the fact that they opened their gates earlier than the Emei faction, and that Muryeongjin5, the sect leader of the Qingcheng sect, had superior judgment.Muryeongjin thought that in order for the Qingcheng sect to revive, those who excelled in world affairs were more needed than those who were strong in martial arts.So, Woo Jinpyeong,6\u00a0a former disciple of the Qingcheng sect, was brought to the headquarters.The family of Woo Jinpyeong soon became close with the Qingcheng sect by having a disciple enter for numerous generations.\u00a0They established Sangjae using the identity of the Cheongseongpa sangga, and they grew rapidly by combining the vision of Sangjae, Mujae, and Daeguk (\uadf8\ub4e4\uc740 \uccad\uc131\ud30c\uc758 \uc18d\uac00\ub77c\ub294 \uc2e0\ubd84\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 \uc0c1\ub2e8\uc744 \uc124\ub9bd\ud588\ub294\ub370, \uc0c1\uc7ac\uc640 \ubb34\uc7ac, \ub300\uad6d\uc744 \uc77d\ub294 \uc2dc\uc57c\uac00 \uc5b4\uc6b0\ub7ec\uc838 \uae09\uc18d\ud55c \uc131\uc7a5\uc744 \ud588\ub2e4.)\u00a0Muryeongjin gave Woo Jinpyeong the position of second-in-command of the Qingcheng sect.It was the first time in hundreds of years of history that a subordinate disciple who was not a main disciple became the elder and second-in-command of the Qingcheng sect.\u00a0That was proof that Woo Jinpyeong was excellent.At first, the elders opposed Woo Jinpyeong\u2019s appointment, but after experiencing his formidable abilities, they became an ardent supporter.Woo Jinpyeong took advantage of the gap that the Emei sect had not opened their gates yet and rapidly expanded the power of the Qingcheng sect.\u00a0In Sichuan Fortress, where the Tang sect was destroyed and the Emei sect was in seclusion, the Qingcheng sect has no rival.\u00a0As if robbing a house, the Qingcheng faction possesses all the major interests of Sichuan Province.The Qingcheng sect was truly at their most prosperous era.\u00a0Both the Qingcheng and Emei sects were classified as Two Factions [\uc774\ud30c(\u4e8c\u6d3e)].\u00a0It was followed by small and medium-sized sects such as the three gates [\uc0bc\ubb38(\u4e09\u9580)], the four rooms [\uc0ac\ubc29(\u56db\u623f)], and the five halls [\uc624\uad00(\u4e94\u9928)].Many of them were mobilized in the hunt for assassins.It was an incident aimed at the Qingcheng sect, the unrivaled stronghold of Sichuan, not elsewhere. Considering the other sect\u2019s future relationship with the Qingcheng sect, the assassins had to be found and annihilated.For that reason, the sects of Sichuan Province sent numerous disciples to support them.Since the Battle of the Blood Heaven (\u8840\u5929\u5927\u6226) when Jeongma clashed for the fate of the world a long time ago, it was the first time that so many warriors in Sichuan Province were again mobilized.They didn\u2019t expect this to happen.Over the past years, Sichuan has been very peaceful where time has passed through without any major incidents.Peace was a blessing to ordinary people, but it was a curse to the warriors who wanted to show off their power. Numerous warriors appeared in Sichuan Province, but they did not have the opportunity to use their force.After spending a long boring time because of the peace, when the assassins appeared, it brought great vitality to the daily life of the martial artists of Sichuan.The martial artists of Sichuan Province voluntarily participated in the quest of hunting the assassins.It was a moment of entertainment that appeared after a long time.If they missed this opportunity, they will not know when another moment would come when they could show their power to the fullest.The warriors persistently pursued and killed the children.The surviving children were scattered. They chose to escape from Sichuan Province.The warriors were waiting for the children while occupying the road leading to the outside.When all eyes of Sichuan were focused on the children, the Qingcheng sect, the target of the assassins, was quiet.The Qingcheng sect did not show any movement as if to show that they were different from the other sects. The appearance of the Qingcheng sect, which did not tremble, was like the gate-house that ruled the Sichuan Province.\u00a0Even though it was night, the Qingcheng sect was bright enough to be reminiscent of a night castle.Many corners of the Qingcheng sect were lit by torchers, and many men stood on a tight-knit vigil. Although the sect did not send out troops to catch the assassins, the internal security were more thorough, reminiscent of a fortress.There was a man holding his breath in the shade of a large tree overlooking the Qingcheng sect.\u00a0It was Pyo-wol who looked at the Qingcheng Sect. He was in perfect assimilation with the darkness.While the other children were struggling to distance themselves from the Qingcheng sect, here he was secretly hiding near them.\u00a0Those who spread the inescapable net only thought of blocking the road to the outside, they did not even consider blocking the road towards the Qingcheng sect.\u00a0Pyo-wol outwitted them by completely acting in the opposite direction.\u00a0Since all of their focus and power was dispersed to spread the inescapable net, now was the perfect opportunity to carry out the assassination.Pyo-wol muttered.\u00a0\u201cIf they want to die as natural enemies of the Jianghu, then I\u2019ll just become one.\u201dThe target of his assassination is Woo Gunsang.\u00a0Pyo-wol\u2019s first solo assassination was just the beginning.\u00a0This is the end of Volume 1 of the Reaper of the Drifting Moon.This was also the most difficult chapter to write. There were so many names and Chinese characters used. I did my best to provide the right translation, but I\u2019m still not sure of it so I still added the raw text in between.

    "Chapter 26": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe first thing Pyo-wol did was to examine the topography of the Qingcheng sect.All assassinations start by knowing the surrounding terrain like the back of their palm. It was to figure out the best intrusion and escape routes in advance.Surprisingly, many assassins tended to overlook this part. This was because preparation takes a lot of time and requires a lot of patience.But more experienced assassins spend more time on these basics.In that respect, Pyo-wol was born with the nature of an assassin.He never stopped being vigilant even for a moment, and he had a habit of constantly observing his surroundings. The habit of not missing out on even the smallest change and taking note of everything helped him grow as an assassin.Although this was his first actual battle, he grasped the surroundings as skillfully as an assassin who had committed numerous murders.The Qingcheng sect itself was like a heavenly fortress.The name Qingcheng (\u9752\u57ce) was given because the peaks which were lined up in a row looked like a blue wall.The moon wave protected by the blue castle was the Qingcheng wave.\u00a0Since the mountain was so steep, it was not easy to secure an infiltration and escape route.There were numerous guards throughout Qingcheng Mountain. All of them were members of the Qingcheng faction.They usually live separately, but when the Qingcheng sect has a problem, they move as one body. It is safe to say that the true strength of the Qingcheng sect lies in the people scattered across Mount Qingcheng.\u00a0It was already difficult to succeed with the assassination but it was even more difficult to get out safely after succeeding.Moreover, the Qingcheng sect of today is at its best after decades. After the fall of the Tang sect, there was no sect that could stop the Qingcheng faction in Sichuan.As such, the border of the Qingcheng sect was also ironclad.It was almost impossible to figure out all the security rotations in one day.It was beneficial for Pyo-wol to just give up, hide, and sneak out of Sichuan fortress after the siege was over.\u00a0Pyo-wol was aware of that too.\u00a0However, his nature and instincts were refusing to back down. The client had him kidnapped against his will, turned him into an assassin, then now having him disposed of.\u00a0He wanted to stop having his fate be controlled by other people.If he steps back now, he will not be able to navigate his destiny by his own will until the end.More than anything else, Pyo-wol wanted to destroy the client who had manipulated his own destiny.For whatever reason, they withdrew the assassination and tried to destroy the evidence by attacking the children. They were trying to bury the fact that they had raised children and secretly attempted to assassinate them.There was only one reason.Things must have changed.It was clear that their relationship with the assassination target had changed and that killing Woo Gunsang now was out of the question. There was no way to know the exact details, but it was clear that the assassination target was not supposed to die anyway.That was the reason why Pyo-wol continued to do the seemingly impossible assassination.\u00a0After examining Mount Qingcheng, Pyo-wol came to one conclusion.\u2018If you are not one of the people of the Qingcheng sect, you can never enter the interior of the sect.\u2019Pyo-wol hid where the entrance of the Qingcheng sect was visible and observed people coming and going. As the number one sect in Sichuan, Qingcheng was visited by thousands of people every day.\u00a0There were those who were affiliated with Jianghu, and there were those that supplied goods.The entire Sichuan Province was bustling with the search for assassins who tried to attack the Qingcheng sect but the actual party involved was living a peaceful life.This demonstrates the appearance of a giant who is not shaken by such trivial things.Merchants and outside soldiers were excluded from the subject.In order to freely roam the interior of the Qingcheng sect, it was necessary to be a member of the Qingcheng sect.\u00a0Pyo-wol\u2019s eyes glowed.\u00a0It was because a young man who had just left the Qingcheng sect caught his eye.He looked about four or five years younger than Pyo-wol.\u00a0He smiled brightly at the soldiers guarding the front door and went out alone. His detailed identity was unknown, but given his attitude toward the other members of the Qingcheng sect, it was clear that he was also a fellow disciple of the said faction.\u00a0Pyo-wol secretly followed him.The young man hummed and walked without even thinking that someone would secretly follow him.Dodong was Dojin, a third generation disciple of the Qingcheng sect.Although Dojin was the youngest of the third-generation disciples, he was very talented and friendly so he was loved by many. He was now on his way to the nearby area to obtain medicinal herbs under the orders of his masterHis father-in-law belonged to the Yakseondang (\u85ac\u5584\u8cde) of the Qingcheng sect.Naturally, Dojin also belonged to Yakseondang following his master and was doing one of his chores. One of which was collecting herbs from a nearby mountain.\u00a0\u201cI guess I\u2019ll head to the nearest\u2014 Kurgh!\u201dDojin stopped his muttering and immediately felt something on his neck. Something had tightened around his throat.\u00a0He was not that far from the sect. If he can manage to scream, the Qingcheng soldiers will jump right in. But in the end, Dojin couldn\u2019t scream.Kwak!The noose that tightened his throat suddenly lifted him up into the air.Dojin\u2019s body was flung onto a tree.\u00a0\u201cWho\u2014!\u201dDojin was about to shout, when a sharp dagger pierced his thigh.\u2018Kugh!\u2019Dojin screamed, his throat bursting. But his screams could not flow out of his mouth. Because the man who had stabbed him in the thigh with the sharp dagger was covering his mouth with a strong hand.It was Pyo-wol.\u00a0The moment he looked into Pyo-wol\u2019s eyes, Dojin froze.Those were eyes that he had never seen in the Qingcheng sect.\u00a0It was a pair of eyes with an expression that could not simply be explained as either cold or emotionless.\u00a0The soft red light in his eyes reminded him of a snake.Dojin was overwhelmed by Pyo-wol\u2019s eyes and could not move.He seemed to understand the feelings of a rat standing in front of a snake.Now Dojin was a mouse.And Pyo-wol was a viper full of deadly poison that could suffocate him anytime.Even though Pyo-wol\u2019s blood lust was suppressed, Dojin still couldn\u2019t move. Pyo-wol\u2019s presence greatly overwhelms him.Pyo-wol closed Dojin\u2019s mouth with his hands and asked.\u00a0\u201cAre you a disciple of the Qingcheng sect? If yes, nod your head.\u201dDojin nodded quickly.\u201cI\u2019ll let you go now, so you can answer my questions. You better not consider screaming for help.\u201dDojin nodded once more.When he felt Pyo-wol loosening his hands, Do-jin forgot his promise and tried to shout out loud.Kak!He felt a fiery pain in his shoulder.Pyo-wol covered his mouth again and drove a dagger. It was truly terrifying to see a blade as thin as a child\u2019s finger piercing his shoulder.\u2018Arggh!\u2019Dojin\u2019s eyes shook.\u00a0Pyo-wol\u2019s scared eyes seemed to have changed even more terrifyingly. It felt like Pyo-wol was really going to kill him the next time he screamed. So he desperately suppressed the scream.Only then did Dojin realize.The fact that the man in front of him could kill him at any time. And in a way he couldn\u2019t even imagine.If the dagger stuck in his shoulder had pierced his neck, he would be dead.Yellow liquid flowed from his trousers.He peed because of extreme fear.Pyo-wol said as he loosened the hand that covered his mouth.\u201cIf you scream again, you will be unable to see the world again with your own two eyes.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026!\u201dDojin replied politely.\u201cYour name?\u201d\u201cDo\u2026Dojin.\u201d\u201cWhat is your identity?\u201d\u201cI am a third-generation disciple of the Qingcheng sect.\u201d\u201cIs that all?\u201d\u201cI\u2026I belong to the Yakseondang.\u201d\u201cWhat does Yakseondang do?\u201dDojin confided in everything he knew.He was out of his mind because of fear.He was not a second generation disciple, he was only a third disciple. He was just a young boy who had just entered the sect. It was impossible for him to possess the spirit that was prepared to die.In order to live, he confided everything he knew.Pyo-wol scraped out all the information he could find out from him.\u201cI ask you one last time. What kind of person is Woo Gunsang?\u201d\u201cWa-wait, are you talking about senior brother, Woo Gunsang of the Great Star of Qingcheng (\u9752\u57ce\u5b64\u661f)?!\u201d\u201cGreat Star of Qingcheng?\u201dPyo-wol frowned.Because it felt unusual from the start.\u201cSenior brother Woo Gunsang is the best disciple produced by the Qingcheng sect. At a young age, he learned most of the Qingcheng\u2019s martial arts and has reached a very high stage. It is said that the former masters of the Qingcheng sect have shown their interest in teaching him directly.\u201dDojin told Pyo-wol everything he knew.To sum up his words, he said that Gunsang Woo was the son of Woo Jinpyeong, the second-in-command of the Qingcheng sect, and was a person of absolute talent.His talent was so great that all of the previous masters of the Qingcheng sect respected him and taught him martial arts.Thanks to his formidable talent, he became a great disciple even though he was only ten years older than Dojin, and he was expected to be the one who would further revive the Qingcheng sect.\u00a0\u2018This is the worst.\u2019Pyo-wol thought that Woo Gunsang was a great being, considering that seven years had to be invested in carrying out the assassination, but he did not know that he was such great existence to the extent that Woo Gunsang received all the expectations of the Qingcheng sect.\u2018No\u2026 maybe it\u2019s to be expected? That\u2019s why seven years of training was needed.\u2019Although it is not possible to know the level of the opponent\u2019s martial arts in detail, it was clear that he was a great master if he earned the nickname of the Great Star of Qingcheng.\u00a0Pyo-wol was thinking of giving up. But it\u2019s too late for him to step back.When they find out that Dojin is gone, they will surely come after them.Even if he stepped back without doing anything, the risk was the same.Pyo-wol had no choice.Dojin said.\u201cOh, I\u2019ve told you everything I know, so please\u2026 spare me.\u201dTears streamed down from his eyes.Pyo-wol touched his face with his hand for a moment. Dojin trembled at the eerie feeling.At that moment, Pyo-wol put blood on his face.Dojin\u2019s body hardened like a stone statue. He will be stuck for a day or so unless someone releases him.\u00a0Pyo-wol stood next to Dojin and began touching his face. The items he received from the Blood Phantom Group also included makeup tools.Lime, glutinous rice, and honey were mixed and applied all over his face, and makeup was applied in a color similar to the skin color. Soon, Dojin and Pyo-wol\u2019s faces became similar.\u2018Hyuk!\u2019Dojin was appalled to see Pyo-wol\u2019s face which has changed to resemble his own.If someone would look closely, they would be able to notice the difference, but at first glance, they both look indistinguishable.In fact, the best way was to remove Dojin\u2019s face skin and use it. However, the process of making a face mask was complicated and time consuming, so it could not be used immediately.Even if it was clumsy, it was much more efficient to put on makeup. Of course, the probability of getting caught was high, but it was the best way for Pyo-wol now who was rushed for time.Pyo-wol touched Dojin\u2019s face to check his facial muscles. Then he took off Dojin\u2019s clothes and wore them on himself.He could not check his overall look because he didn\u2019t have a mirror, but he guessed it was passable.\u00a0Pyo-wol left Dojin alone and headed towards the main gate of the Qingcheng sect. His gait was similar to that of Dojin.Not only his face, but everything from his body shape, gait, and atmosphere all resemble Dojin.The soldiers guarding the main gate of the Qingcheng sect found Pyo-wol and talked to him.\u201cOh, it\u2019s Dojin. Why are you coming back already?\u201d\u201cOh! I\u2019ve left something behind.\u201d\u201cJeez, you scatterbrain! Stay focused, you hear me?\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201dPyo-wol scratched his head and made a sullen expression. Then the man who was guarding the front door smiled and opened the way.He did not even suspect that the young man in front of him was not Dojin. Pyo-wol was the same as Dojin to that extent.\u00a0Pyo-wol calmly passed through the front door.As he passed through the main gate, the Qingcheng sect revealed its true form.The appearance of a number of temples boasted great majesty. Nevertheless, the reason why Pyo-wol was not overwhelmed was because he had experienced such a landscape like this before.The exterior of the buildings that existed in the underground cave were similar.It was similar yet different at the same time. First of all, the size was vastly different. There were buildings all over the place that was not present in the underground cavity. However, the overall layout has not changed.He had been there for seven years.Even if he closed his eyes and moved around, he would be able to find his destination.Pyo-wol proceeded as calmly as if he were at home.He already knew where the securities were tight and where it was weak. He deliberately moved only to places with weak security.\u00a0Thousands of people passed by him, but no one doubted Pyo-wol.If someone would look closely at his face, they would have noticed something strange, but no one managed to notice because Pyo-wol was acting so naturally.Occasionally, when someone who knows Dojin, Pyo-wol just calmly greeted them back and passed by.\u2018Is it there?\u2019Pyo-wol finally arrived near his destination.Bright Moon Palace (\u660e\u6708\u6bbf).It was the residence of Woo Gunsang.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 27": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 27Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter their seclusion ended, the Qingcheng sect continued to expand.Because new disciples continued to be accepted, there was insufficient space to stay for the upcoming generations.\u00a0It was not difficult to expand.In Sichuan Province, the Qingcheng sect had already established a unique force. There were so many active disciples who was willing to donate large amounts of money for the Qingcheng sect.As the power of the Qingcheng sect grew, the benefits to be received also followed. There was no reason not to donate.\u00a0In a way, it was like a Qingcheng sect tax, where both the disciples and the sect prospered together.As time pass by, a whole new environment was created. Because of that, even the disciples of the Qingcheng sect were unable to memorize the names of the newly created buildings.The Qingcheng sect often changes its establishments, but there are some places that do not change.One of them was Sangqing Palace.Since Sangqing Palace was the most important place in the Qingcheng sect, the security was strict.Most major events of the Qingcheng sect were all decided at Sangqing Palace. Even today, the elders were gathered at Sangqing Palace, including Muryeongjin, a long-time sect leader of the Qingcheng sect.Muryeongjin was an old man in his early seventies. But looking at his appearance alone, it was hard to guess that he had aged that much.Because of his unconventional appearance, deep eyes, and naturally flowing dignity, he only looked like he was in his early to mid-fifties.It was the same with the other elders.The elders who had mastered the martial arts of the Qingcheng sect looked much younger than their actual age. Rather, the person who looked the oldest was Woo Jinpyeong, who is called the Jinang (last) of the Qingcheng sect.Because he came from a branch family of the Qingcheng sect, his martial arts were the weakest. That is why he looked much older than the other elders.The first person to speak was Muryeongjin,1\u00a0the sect leader.\u00a0\u201cHas the outside situation calmed down?\u201d\u201cIt seems that the search for the assassin has come to an end.\u201d\u201cHow dare an assassin target our sect? Do you think this makes sense, junior brother?\u201d\u201cOf course it doesn\u2019t make sense. It\u2019s highly likely that someone has plotted this.\u201dWoo Jinpyeong\u2019s eyes lit up coldly as he answered.\u201cWho do you think it could be?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too early to make a hasty decision because we don\u2019t have the right information yet.\u201d\u201cAre we going to leave it that way?\u201d\u201cOf course not. I\u2019ve already sent some of my disciples to gather information.\u201d\u201cAs expected of junior brother Woo.\u201dMuryeongjin smiled, satisfied.The old man with a heavy atmosphere, who had been silent until now, opened his mouth.\u201cWhoever caused this situation must never be forgiven! Our sect is currently at a crucial turning point. We must make it so that something like this never happens again.\u201dHe was Mu Jeong-jin,2\u00a0an elder of the Qingcheng sect.\u00a0Mu Jeong-jin was unquestionably the number one sword of the Qingcheng.\u00a0No matter how brilliant Woo Jinpyeong was, the Qingcheng sect would not have been able to achieve this level of development if it hadn\u2019t been supported by the armed forces of Mu Jeong-jin.\u00a0Woo Jinpyeong nodded in response to Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s words.\u201cIt will be so, senior brother!\u201d\u201cThe Shaolin Temple, the Wudang Sect, and the Mount Hua Sect, who participated in the battle after opening their doors during the War of the Demons and Heaven, regained their former reputation. However, those who sealed their doors and did not participate in the war such as our sect and the Emei sect, only gained an empty name of \u2018Four Heavenly Kings\u2019 in Sichuan. However, our actual power is far short of theirs. To catch up with them, we must tighten our reins. If we can\u2019t move forward because we\u2019re caught up in an incident like this, even if we die, we won\u2019t be able to reach our previous glory.\u201dAt Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s words, all the elders nodded their heads.A lot of things have changed in Jianghu due to the war that took place several decades ago.At that time, Jianghu was in danger of being conquered by the Celestial Demon Troupe.3\u00a0If the extraordinary martial artist named Lee Kwak had not formed the Heaven\u2019s Will Alliance [\ucc9c\uc758\ub9f9(\u5929\u610f\u76df)] and resisted, Jianghu would have fallen into the hands of the Celestial Demon Troupe.At that time, the Shaolin Temple, the Wudang sect, the Mount Hua Sect, the Qingcheng, and the Emei sect had their gates closed. However, soon the Shaolin Temple, the Wudang sect, the Mount Hua Sect boldly opened their gates and participated in the Heaven\u2019s Will Alliance, and made a great contribution in driving out the Celestial Demon Troupe. On the other hand, the Qingcheng and Emei sect did not open the gates because they were careful.The difference divided the fate of the five sects.\u00a0The Shaolin Temple, Wudang, and Mount Hua faction, who participated in the war, regained their former glory with praise from the people, but the Qingcheng and Emei sect were criticized by the people.Since they unlocked their gates late, Jianghu\u2019s gaze on them was unbearably cold. It was unfair because of their circumstances, but they could not turn back Jianghu\u2019s already tilted gaze.Now, people did not think that the Qingcheng sect and the Emei sect were in the same ranks as the Shaolin Temple, the Wudang and the Mount Hua sect.\u00a0Actually it was true.\u00a0Jianghu\u2019s outstanding martial artists preferred the other three sects more than the Qingcheng sect or the Emei sect.The Qingcheng faction has recently expanded its ranks and has been eagerly following the three clans, but the gap was still considerable. The gap was not narrowing at all, but rather widening.Because of that, the sense of crisis that Qingcheng felt was really great.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. If things go as planned, we\u2019ll be able to catch up with them within a decade.\u201d\u201cHow dependable. It\u2019s reassuring to have someone like you!\u201d\u201cNo, senior brother!\u201d\u201cSince you\u2019re so great, your son must have taken after you.\u201dWoo Jinpyeong\u2019s face darkened slightly at Mu Jeongjin\u2019s words.\u201cWoo Gunsang has isolated himself to focus his training with the thought of atonement.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cI apologize.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cMy son\u2014\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s understandable for a boy of his age.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to apologize for something that has already been taken care of peacefully.\u201d\u201cI will make sure that he pulls himself together.\u201dMu Jeong-jin replied with a look that said nothing was wrong.\u201cYes, that\u2019s plenty. No matter what anyone says, Woo Gunsang\u2019s talent is real.\u201dAt Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s words, the elders nodded their heads.\u201cI heard that you accepted Emei\u2019s sects proposal of marriage?\u201dThis time, it was Muryeongjin, the sect leader, who opened his mouth.Woo Jinpyeong made a sad expression.\u201cHow did that happen?\u201d\u201cMarriage with the Emei sect\u2026 Not bad. Is the bride the youngest disciple of the Elderly Master of Brilliance?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s rumored that she possesses both intelligence and beauty. If that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s not bad match for Woo Gunsang.\u201d\u201cI think so too.\u201d\u201cThen why is your expression so dark?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s probably because I\u2019m reluctant.\u201d\u201cIs it because of the Elderly Master?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWhen the Elderly Master of Brilliance was mentioned, all the elders frowned at once.There was an existence that made people feel bad just by hearing their name. Guhwasata was such a person.Like the Qingcheng sect, the Emei sect fell behind because of the late opening of their gate. No, the Emei sect was far below that of the Qingcheng sect, let alone the other three great sects.For that reason, she was determined to catch up with the Qingcheng sect in any way.Such tenacity of the Guhwasata made the elders of the Qingcheng uncomfortable.\u201cIf Woo Gunsang gets married to the youngest disciple of the Elderly Master of Brilliance, we will have no choice but to make concessions.\u201d\u201cHmm, so that\u2019s the problem. If we make a mistake, there\u2019s a risk that our sect will be the ones who will be devoured. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve rejected the proposal so far, but now, there\u2019s nothing I can do about it.\u201d\u201cHowever, we have no choice. We can\u2019t continue to be enemies in this small land of Sichuan. Accept it.\u201d\u201cI will.\u201d\u201cWoo Gunsang is the only hope of the Qingcheng sect to catch up with the other three sects. Never forget that fact.\u201dThe meeting ended with Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s last words.* * *Bright Moon Palace was an old hall with the history of the Qingcheng sect.Although the size of the hall is not very large, it is separated by a high wall and there is a space for closed training in the basement.All those who stayed in the Bright Moon Palace left a great mark in the history of the Qingchent sect. Giving the Bright Moon Palace to Woo Gunsang meant that the Qingcheng sect had great expectations for him.Pyo-wol looked at the Bright Moon Palace without saying a word.He saw the real Bright Moon Palace for the first time today, but he didn\u2019t feel that it was unfamiliar because he saw a hall like this every day in an underground cave.Although there are third generation disciples who stood guard at the entrance of Bright Moon Palace, Pyo-wol knew ten more ways to sneak into Bright Moon Palace.\u00a0There was no one who was not a disciple of the Qingcheng sect who knew this place better than Pyo-wol. No, even among the disciples of the Qingcheng sect, there was no one who could rival Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol was walking along the wall and jumping lightly around the corner.A tiled roof was placed on top of the walled fences of the Bright Moon Palace. It was only created when the Bright Moon Palace was first built, and did not exist in any recently created fences.\u00a0Pyo-wol crawled on the tiled roof of the wall fence.Originally, when a tiled roof was put on, the inside of the wall would be filled with soil. But as time passed, the soil inside of the wall would flow down making its inside empty.The same was true for the fortifications in the underground cave.It was not possible to fill the insides of the wall with soil because the layout was made in a hurry in the underground cave, but Pyo-wol guessed that maybe the situation was the same for the real wall of the Bright Moon Palace.\u00a0His thoughts turned out to be right.Pyo-wol crawled through the empty space between the wall and approached the nearest place to Bright Moon Palace.He felt some soldiers passing under the wall. But they could never be aware of his existence.Pyo-wol was able to move while unfolding the Turtle Breathing Technique. Even if the soldiers knew in advance and prepared for an intruder, it was not easy to detect Pyo-wol\u2019s presence.Pyo-wol, who was moving while holding his breath, heard the voices of the soldiers chatting under the wall.\u00a0\u201cWow, did Woo Gunsang bring in a woman again?\u201d\u201c\u201dShh! Be quiet!\u201d\u201cTo bring a woman inside under the pretext of closure training. That\u2019s really bold of him. Is it one of our disciples this time?\u201cHey, I told you to be quiet! If you don\u2019t want to get caught and be scolded, be careful with your mouth!\u201d\u201cDamn it!\u201dTheir conversation gave Pyo-wol valuable information.\u2018He brings women in here?\u2019The Qingcheng sect was basically a Taoist sectIn the recent years while expanding the sect, they have accepted a lot of disciples and their secular tendencies have strengthened, but the fact that they are a sect based on Taoism has not changed.It was, of course, unimaginable to hold a woman in the training hall. However, a man named Woo Gunsang secretly took the woman into his residence.From what he heard from Dojin, he said that he was attracted by the Qingcheng disciples, but it seemed that there was something different inside the sect from what is known to the world.\u2018Wherever you go, there is always someone who is different on the inside.\u2019It was unfortunate for the Cheongseongpa disciples, but it was a good thing for Pyo-wol.After confirming that no one was around, Pyo-wol quietly flew to the roof of Bright Moon Palace.He landed on the roof silently.It was starting to become dim.Soon night came.\u00a0For others, darkness was a big obstacle, but for Pyo-wol, the night was like another weapon of his. Pyo-wol moved while completely being assimilated into the darkness.He kicked off the roof tile and infiltrated inside.He crawled on all fours like an animal. Still, he did not make any sound.Pyo-wol carefully went through the roof and looked inside the hall. However, the figure of the person presumed to be Woo Gunsang was nowhere to be seen.\u2018It looks like he\u2019s in the basement.\u2019Pyo-wol did not panic.\u00a0He already knew that there was an underground basement here.The problem was opening the entrance to the basement. When the entrance is opened, Woo Gunsang who was inside had no choice but to notice.So Pyo-wol have to think of infiltrating using other places instead.He went through the ventilation hole, which was essential for any underground space. Perhaps even the martial artists of the Qingcheng sect do not know that there is a ventilation hole here.The ventilation holes were hidden quite well.Pyo-wol soon found the place behind a large pillar. It was the vents.\u00a0He carefully opened the vent and sneaked inside.Pyo-wol completely concealed his presence by utilizing the Turtle Breathing Technique. Still, he was not complacent, so he moved as slowly as possible.Finally, Pyo-wol arrived at the underground basement.The location of the ventilation hole was on the ceiling overlooking the underground basement. .Pyo-wol carefully peered into the underground basement.He saw a six-foot-tall man lying there with his clothes off. Next to him was a half-naked woman.\u2018Woo Gunsang\u2026!\u2019As the best weapon of the Qingcheng sect, Woo Gunsang had a well-trained body.The densely developed muscles were reminiscent of a snow leopard (\u96ea\u8c79) that freely roamed in snowy mountains, and calluses were lodged on his palms and back.He was sleeping with the woman in his arms, but there were no flaws in the look of Woo Gunsang.It looked like he would react immediately if there was even a small stimulus from the outside.Woo Gunsang looked like a well-forged sword.Pyo-wol felt goosebumps all over his body. This was the first time he had personally seen a warrior who had reached this level. He also felt a thrill when he saw Gu Juyang, the leader of the Blood Phantom Group, but this time it was different.Woo Gunsang exuded an atmosphere as someone who had reached such a high stage by taking the right steps. There\u2019s a natural aura flowing out. It was a kind of energy that assassins who did not learn proper martial arts and only learned how to kill could never have.\u00a0But Pyo-wol never faltered.\u2018He is also human. If he had his blood drawn or get stabbed with a knife, he would die nonetheless.\u2019Pyo-wol looked into the underground basement.Weapons were scattered everywhere.There were a lot of swords in particular, as if to prove that the martial arts that Woo Gunsang had learned was swordsmanship.There were various types of swords, such as long swords, daggers, and yam swords.Pyo-wol rehearsed the whole scene in his mind.A picture that can only be seen by him was painted in his head. When the painting was completed to some extent, Pyo-wol took out a small bundle of rope from his bosom.It was a gift given by the Blood Phantom Group.Pyo-wol made the rope in the form of a noose and sent it down through the ventilation hole.It was when the noose almost reached Woo Gunsang\u2019s face.Woo Gunsang, who was asleep, suddenly opened his eyes.His eyes were looking exactly where Pyo-wol was hiding.\u2018Caught.\u2019At that moment, Pyo-wol pulled on the rope.Ping!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Woo Gunsang did not ignore his instincts.\u00a0When he opened his eyes, the first thing that caught his eyes was the ventilation hole on the ceiling. He couldn\u2019t see it with the naked eye, but he could instinctively sense that there was something inside the vent.Bang!That was then.He was suddenly short of breath.His throat was choked, and his body was hung up to the ceiling. At the same time, the vents were broken and a black object fell.It was Pyo-wol.\u00a0In his hand was the rope tightening on the neck of Woo Gunsang.As Pyo-wol came down the ceiling, Woo Gunsang\u2019s figure went up.\u201cOh! Senior brother!\u201dAs soon as the woman screamed in surprise, Pyo-wol kicked her in the stomach. The woman, who was defenseless, collapsed without managing to let out a scream because her internal organs were shaken.Squeak!At that moment, Woo Gunsang, who was struggling in the air, cut off the rope above his head with his hand.His hand, which had been injected with internal qi, was like a sword in itself. The rope was immediately cut off, and Woo Gunsang found freedom.Woo Gunsang threw off the rope that was holding his neck and shouted.\u201cWho are you?\u201dInstead of answering, Pyo-wol picked up the sword that was lying on the floor and rushed towards Woo Gunsang.\u00a0Clang!His sword aimed at Woo Gunsang. Woo Gunsang struck Pyo-wol\u2019s sword with the blade of his hand.Jjeoeoeong!The sharply forged sword bounced off.Even though he collided with the blade with his bare hands, there was not a single scratch on the hand of Woo Gunsang.\u00a0It was Jeol Young-soo (\u7d76\u5f71\u624b Absolute Shadow Hand), a secret technique of the Qingcheng sect. Woo Gunsang had reached a level where he could use swordsmanship without actually weilding a sword.\u00a0He snorted\u201cFor an assassin to dare come here.\u201dWoo Gunsang ran towards Pyo-wol and waved his hand. Then a cloud-like match arose and struck the Pyo-wol.\u201cHurgh!\u201dPyo-wol\u2019s body slid backwards as he let out a groan. There was blood on his lips. He was wounded in a single blow.Woo Gunsang advanced with joy.At that moment, Pyo-wol kicked one of the daggers lying on the floor. The dagger flew precisely at the head of Woo Gunsang.\u00a0Heung!Woo Gunsang caught the dagger in between his fingers. Although it was a short sword that did not reach the length of a sword he usually used, he felt that his heart was reassured as he held a weapon in his hand.Although he was good at martial arts with his bare hands, he was still the most confident with his sword fighting skills.The length of the sword does not affect his sword attack. That was how well-versed Woo Gunsang was when it came to swords.Shishk!He unleashed one of the swordsmanship of the Qingcheng sect, the Red Drop Sword (\u9752\u96f2\u8d64\u971e\u5263 Qingyun Chixia Sword).The entire underground dance floor seemed to be dyed with the red glow emanating from his sword.Pyo-wol felt an extreme sense of crisis.The weight contained in the sword of Woo Gunsang was so great that he could not bear it.Pit pit pit!In an instant, Pyo-wol was wounded in three places.Each wound was not light.\u201cKuergh!\u201dPyo-wol let out a scream and staggered. But he persevered without falling down.\u00a0Woo Gunsang fired another shot at Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol avoided all of those attacks by a hair\u2019s breadth.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re pretty good.\u201dA cruel light flashed in Woo Gunsang\u2019s eyes.He continued to pressure Pyo-wol like a cat playing with a mouse. Pyo-wol\u2019s whole body was gradually stained with blood from Woo Gunsang\u2019s formidable swordsmanship.Even if it wasn\u2019t, it was a free car because of the practice of closing the pipe that I didn\u2019t want. (\uadf8\ub807\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc544\ub3c4 \uc6d0\uce58 \uc54a\ub358 \ud3d0\uad00\uc218\ub828 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ubb34\ub8cc\ud558\ub358 \ucc28\uc600\ub2e4.)He brought in disciples who usually sucked up on him, and held them in his arms, but the endeavor became boring.Woo Gunsang had stood out since childhood.His formidable intelligence made it easy to learn any martial arts.Everyone applauded his outstanding growth, and the seniors of the Qingcheng sect each taught him martial arts.It was probably from then.Learning martial arts was no longer fun.The martial arts that others had to learn for more than a year, he learned in a month. As he learned it so easily, his interest in martial arts began to fall.\u00a0From that moment on, he started to become interested in women.There were many women who sucked up to him. He, too, was at a hot-blooded age, so he did not shy away from any woman who came up to him.\u00a0If it were just that, it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal. The trouble arose when he forcibly took a woman. At that time, Woo Gunsang was intoxicated and lost his judgment.\u00a0When he met a certain woman, her beauty made Woo Gun-sang act like a beast as he forcibly took the woman. The woman who felt ashamed, committed suicide making her family fall apart.Woo Jinpyeong barely managed the situation, and he ordered Woo Gunsang to spend a whole year training in isolation.\u00a0Although he admitted his mistake, the fact that Woo Gunsang had to be put on probation for a year was a cruel treatment that was hard for him to accept.So his heart was filled with discontent. Even as he held a female disciple in his arms, the deterioration in his heart did not go away.\u00a0Then, the assassin\u2019s attack exploded his anger.\u201cDid that bitch\u2019s father send you?\u201dWoo Gunsang mistook Pyo-wol as an assassin sent by the father of the woman he raped. The woman\u2019s father was a power to recognize in the neighborhood. He had enough fortune to hire a few assassins.\u00a0Pyo-wol didn\u2019t answer.His attitude provoked his anger even more.Woo Gunsang performed the sword attack of the Qingcheng sect that he had learned so far as if he had been angry with Pyo-wol.Ssis! Ssiis!The entire underground basement was filled with his swordsmanship. It was only then that Pyo-wol realized how great a martial artist Woo Gunsang was.From the sword of Woo Gunsang, three swords came out. At least it\u2019s a dagger, so if he had a long sword, his neck would have been separated from his body.That is why Pyo-wol deliberately threw a dagger and held it.Pyo-wol did not dare to block the sword in front of him, so he managed to avoid the attack of Woo Gunsang with the technique of Nalyeotagon (\u61f6\u9a62\u6253\u6efe Lazy Donkey Rolling).\u201cDear!\u201dWoo Gunsang followed Pyo-wol and spread the water.At that moment, Pyo-wol kicked a sword that was rolling on the floor with his foot.Kang!However, the sword he kicked collided with the dagger of Woo Gunsang and bounced off.Pyo-wol grabbed the bounced sword in the air and swung it.\u201cHow funny! How dare you attack me with my own sword?\u201dWoo Gunsang, who was a martial artist until the very tip of his head, changed his sword.Instead of the Cheongunjeokhagum, it was the Seventy-Two Sword Waves, one of the secret techniques of the Qingcheng sect.\u00a0As if the waves were pounding seventy-two times, the revolving sword had a tremendous power that was difficult for any master of Jianghu to easily take.\u00a0The Seventy-Two Sword Waves was not the highest swordsmanship technique of the Qingcheng sect. Even though there were a few more techniques with stronger power than that, Woo Gunsang was most familiar with the Seventy-Two Sword Waves.He was fascinated with the Seventy-Two Sword Waves from a young age. Since it\u2019s been a long time since he learned it, he reached a point where he can execute the technique even with his eyes closed.Ssisisis!Sharp sword strikes flew in succession like waves.Pyo-wol\u2019s body seemed to be in danger as if it was going to be torn apart at any moment. Pyo-wol fled behind the woman who was earlier beaten down by him.\u201cMove!\u201dGunsang Woo kicked the body of the woman whom he had made love with a while ago. The woman bounced out and hit the wall.As a result, the nerves of Woo Gunsang were temporarily distracted.That was then.The red light in Pyo-wol\u2019s eyes glowed. He swung his sword in the wrong direction as if he had given up on everything.A smirk crept on the corner of his mouth.\u201cFoolish\u2014\u201dKaang!Then the unbelievable happened.The sword of Woo Gunsang which was raging wildly like a wave, was blocked by Pyo-wol\u2019s sword.\u201cWhat?\u201dWoo Gunsang dismissed it as a coincidence and again unfolded his Seventy-Two Sword Waves.Kaang!But this time, he was blocked by the sword of Pyo-wol. Pyo-wol cut off his attack, as if he had already known Woo Gunsang\u2019s swordsmanship in advance.Indeed he does.\u00a0The Seventy-Two Sword Waves displayed by Woo Gunsang was the martial art Pyo-wol knew. The unknown swordsman he learned in the underground cavity was the Seventy-Two Sword Waves.Three children out of the twenty-seven children had learned the Seventy-Two Sword Waves. Two of three were attacked by the other children, with Pyo-Wol being the sole survivor.Pyo-wol learned the Seventy-Two Sword Waves to death in order to survive. So, he knew the characteristics of the Seventy-Two Sword Waves better than anyone.Although his understanding and mastery may be lagging behind that of Woo Gunsang, he surpassed him in terms of demolishing the technique.To Woo Gunsang, the Seventy-Two Sword Waves was simply a sword that he had mastered, but for Pyo-wol, the Seventy-Two Sword Waves was the only hope he expected to use in order to survive.Ssis!Pyo-wol stabbed his sword.It was an ordinary stab that relied on his instincts. However, its speed and direction exceeded the expectations of Woo Gunsang.\u00a0Swift Mind!\u00a0The speed of the mind moves the body.On this one chance, Pyo-Wol risked everything he had.Puug!The sword pierced his chest.The sword of Pyo-wol pierced through the chest of Woo Gunsang.\u00a0\u201cKekeuhg!\u201dWoo Gunsang vomited blood.The blood poured out of Woo Gunsang\u2019s mouth had soaked Pyo-wol\u2019s face.\u201cHow can the likes of you use the Seventy-Two Sword Waves\u2026?!\u201dAlthough Pyo-wol did not know, the technique he unwittingly unfolded was a resemblance of the Seventy-Two Sword Waves. He executed the Seventy-Two Sword Waves as he destroyed the Seventy-Two Sword Waves of Woo Gunsang.\u00a0No one else knew, but Woo Gunsang was able to recognize that.\u00a0Pyo-wol didn\u2019t answer.He couldn\u2019t.It felt like the energy would scatter and collapse if he opened his mouth. In the brief moment of confrontation, Pyo-wol poured everything he had.\u00a0The key was to have Woo Gunsang execute the Seventy-Two Sword Waves. Lim Sayeol said that the unknown swordsmanship, the Seventy-Two Sword Waves, was the mastered martial arts of their target.Pyo-wol thought there was a chance of winning if he would let Woo Gunsang perform the Seventy-Two Sword Waves. That\u2019s why he desperately dragged time to unfold the Seventy-Two Swords.This was the first time he had used the Thunder-Splitting technique in practice.It was a gamble that could cost his life.\u00a0His gamble might have been a success, but he suffered serious injuries in return. He had to get out of here quickly.\u00a0Pyo-wol looked at the woman for a moment.The woman who had been struck by Woo Gunsang was losing her mind. Pyo-wol exited the underground basement through the ventilation hole.\u00a0From now on, it was a race against time.He had to get as far away from the Qingcheng sect as possible before they noticed.* * *Cheong-il was one of the members of the Qingcheng sect and was in charge of the Yakseondang.Although he is not as strong in martial arts as his high-ranking brother Cheong-yeop, Qing Ming, or Woo Gunsang, he was well versed in medicine and was respected by many of his disciples.Cheong-il looked at his disciple, Jin-gwang, with a frown on his forehead.\u201cWhat do you mean? Dojin is on the grounds? Wasn\u2019t Dojin walking around the mountain collecting herbs?\u201d\u201cI thought so too\u2026\u201dJin-gwang put on a puzzled expression.It was him who instructed Dojin to gather the herbs from the mountain.\u00a0But he heard some strange news. It was said that Dojin, who had gone out under his orders earlier, returned to the Qingcheng sect for some reason.There were also testimonies from the disciples who saw Dojin.Jin-gwang wandered the Qingcheng sect in search of Dojin. However, Dojin could not be found anywhere.\u201cThat\u2019s so strange. It\u2019s not enough for Dojin to dare disobey my orders, he\u2019s even wandering around the grounds without any permission?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been looking for him too, but I can\u2019t find him anywhere.\u201d\u201cIs it not possible for the other disciples to see it wrong?\u201d\u201cSeveral people have already said that they saw him.\u201d\u201cWhere was the last time you saw Dojin?\u201d\u201cNear the Bright Moon Palace.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe two left Yakseondang and went to the nearby Bright Moon Palace.Cheong-il grabbed the man who was guarding the Bright Moon Palace and asked.\u201cHave you ever seen Dojin?\u201d\u201cI saw him roaming around.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes. Why?\u201dInstead of answering, Cheong-il frowned.Something didn\u2019t feel right.It\u2019s strange that Dojin, who had to go around the mountain and collect herbs, came back without a word, then was seen wandering around Bright Moon Palace.\u00a0Something weird was happening.Suddenly, the eyes of Cheong-il turned to the Bright Moon Palace.\u201cIs Woo Gunsang inside?\u201d\u201cYes. He\u2019s in training in isolation.\u201d\u201cSend him a message that I will visit him.\u201d\u201cThat is\u2026\u2026.\u201dAs the disciple, Lee Dae-jae, hesitated, Cheong-il\u2019s face distorted.\u201cHas he taken a woman in again?\u201d\u201cI apologize.\u201dThe disciple Lee Dae-jae quickly bowed his head. He could not dare tell a lie to Chung-il.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m going inside.\u201dCheong-il pushed the disciple and entered the Bright Moon Palace.Lee Dae-jae who was guarding the residence did not dare to stop him.\u201cUgh! How do you do it?\u201dHe hurriedly followed Qing-il, expecting a lightning bolt to fall soon.After looking around the inside of Bright Moon Palace for a while, Cheong-il found the entrance to the underground basement.\u00a0Grung!When the lock was activated, the entrance opened with a dull sound.Cheong-il, Jin-gwang, and Lee Dae-jae went down to the underground basement through the entrance.The corpse of Woo Gunsang greeted them.\u201cWhat? Woo Gunsang\u2026!\u201dChung-il ran towards Woo Gunsang and looked at his condition. However, Woo Gunsang had already stopped breathing.\u201cWho dares\u2014!\u201dThe roar of Cheong-il echoed through the underground basement.Jin-gwang, who understood the situation, ran to the upper rooms and shouted.\u201cIt\u2019s an assassin! An assassin has killed the senior brother Woo Gunsang!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Dang!An emergency bell rang dizzyingly in the quiet Qingcheng sect. .The disciples of the Qingcheng sect, who were resting quietly, ran out bewildered. Then came the shocking news that Woo Gunsang had been attacked and killed by an assassin.\u201cLook for the assassin now!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t let go of him!\u201dAll the martial artists scattered across Mount Qingcheng\u00a0 came out and searched for the assassin who killed Woo Gunsang.\u00a0A disciple of the Cheongseongpa within the Cheongseongpa. There was also an unprecedented incident where a promising Kigi died after being attacked by an assassin.Of course, the Qingcheng sect was turned upside down.In particular, the anger of Woo Jinpyeong, who lost his child, and Muryeongjin, who lost the future of the Qingcheng sect was great.They looked at the corpse of Woo Gunsang with wretched eyes.\u201cGUNSAAANG!\u201dWoo Jinpyeong knelt in front of his son\u2019s body and horribly sobbed.Woo Jinpyeong, who was like a rock since he had never been shaken even once in Qingcheng sect, was now sobbing defenselessly.At the sight of Woo Jinpyeong figure, the expressions of the elders of the Qingcheng sect became somber.\u201cOh Primordial God. How could our sect endure such an ordeal\u2026\u201dMuryeongjin closed his eyes and shook his white beard.Mu Jeong-jin, an elder right below him, approached him.\u201cSenior brother!\u201d\u201cSpeak, junior brother!\u201d\u201cWe must deal with that child.\u201dMu Jeong-jin\u2019s gaze was pointing to the female disciple lying unconscious.Muryeongjin frowned.\u201cWhat do you mean? That child is also a disciple of our sect, and yet you still want to dispose of her?\u201d\u201cThe honor of Gunsang is at stake. If it becomes known to the outside world that he has brought a female disciple during his closed training, the honor of Gunsang will hit rock bottom. He is already dead, so\u00a0 shouldn\u2019t we at least protect his honor?\u201d\u201cJunior brother!\u201dMuryeongjin unleashed a mournful roar.All the other elders flinched, but Mu Jeong-jin continued speaking without changing a single expression on his face.\u201cWhat\u2019s done is done. Since Gunsang, the best member of the Qingcheng sect, has died, our sect\u2019s reputation will also collapse.\u201d\u00a0Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s voice was as cold as ice.He was the one who loved Woo Gunsang more than anyone else.Except for senior brother Ko Yeopjin, who had retired a long time ago, Woo Gunsang was the greatest talent of the Qingcheng sect.\u00a0He regarded Woo Gunsang as a talented person who would succeed in his footsteps so he taught him with great care. Although his growth has been slow recently, he has fallen into gloom in the middle, but the fact that he is a talented person who will open up a brilliant future for Qingcheng sect has not changed.Woo Gunsang\u2019s death was nothing short of deteriorating the future of the Qingcheng sect for at least a decade. His death was more tragic than anyone else, but now was the time to minimize the damage. Otherwise, it would take more than a decade for the sect to recover.\u201cClearly, there must be someone who hired the assassin. Someone who would benefit from the fall of Gunsang and the Qingcheng sect. We must not let that happen, no matter what.\u201d\u201cUrgh\u2026!\u201dWhen Mu Jeong-jin spoke so harshly, Muryeongjinin put on a perplexed expression on his face.\u201cSenior brother\u2026! That shouldn\u2019t be the case! No matter how important the reputation of the sect is, it\u2019s not as important as a human life!\u201d\u00a0Among the elders, the Mu Hwajin, who had the mildest disposition, came forward and stopped the Mu Jeong-jin. Then Mu Jeong-jin looked at the other elders and said,\u201cIs that what all of you think? Do you think it\u2019s okay for the sect\u2019s reputation to fall to the ground like this? If this continues, we will not be able to catch up with the Shaolin or Wudang, but rather the gap will continue to widen and we will be reduced to just some mere sect.\u201dNo one answered.\u00a0However, their eyes were not so different from those of Mu Jeong-jin. At the appearance of the elders, Muryeongjin and Mu Hwajin put on a difficult expression.That was then.\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201dWoo Jinpyeong, who was weeping in front of his child\u2019s body, stood up.\u00a0In his hand was a sword that was stuck in the chest of Woo Gunsang.\u00a0\u201cJunior brother!\u201dMuryeongjinin shouted in surprise, but he could not stop Woo Jinpyeong.Clang!Woo Jinpyeong stabbed the sword into the female disciple\u2019s chest.\u00a0The woman who already lost reason, vomited blood then died.\u00a0\u201cJunior brother Woo! What have you done!?\u201dMuryeongjinin took the sword from his hand.Woo Jinpyeong sat down on one spot and shouted.\u201cHuk-hyuh! What was I supposed to do then? Gunsang was not just the hope of the Qingcheng sect! He was everything to me! As a father, how could I just watch Gunsang\u2019s honor crumble like this?! You can curse me all you like! I dedicated myself to the Qingcheng sect. If you don\u2019t understand this level of inconvenience, I\u2019d rather leave the sect\u201dThere was madness in Woo Jinpyeong\u2019s voice.At this point, the Muryeongjin and Mu Hwajin had no choice but to understand. What\u2019s more, the act had already happened.What\u2019s more important is setting it right.\u00a0\u201cHuu\u2013 For now, let\u2019s just say that the girl came to receive instruction from Gunsang and then died because of the assassin.\u201d\u201cYou thought well.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if it was a really good decision. I really don\u2019t know.\u201dAs Muryeongjin let out a deep sigh, Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s eyes shone sharply and said,\u00a0\u201cIsn\u2019t there something more important than that now?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! We must catch the assassin who\u2019s the culprit in all of this.\u201d\u201cWe must capture him and let him tell us who\u2019s the person behind him.\u201d\u201cHave the rest of the sects in Sichuan cooperate. For those who refuse to cooperate, let them know that we will take it as a sign that they don\u2019t want to be in Sichuan any longer.\u201d\u201cI will pass on the words of the sect leader to the Emei, Wudang, Shaolin, and all the other sects. All those involved in this sneak attack will be identified and punished.\u201d\u201cHuu\u2013!\u201dWhen Muryeongjinin\u2019s permission was granted, Mu Jeong-jin led all the elders and went out. As the words of Muryeongjin were delivered to the other sects, the whole of Sichuan was turned upside down.* * *Guhwasata\u2019s eyes trembled.In her hand was a letter tied to a bird\u2019s ankle that came from the Qingcheng sect.\u00a0 The letter included a request for cooperation with the Qingcheng sect.Words were a request, but considering the prestige of the Qingcheng sect in Sichuan Province, it was no less than a command that could not be refused.The problem was not the Qingcheng sect\u2019s request for cooperation.The story was that an assassin had killed Woo Gunsang.\u201cIs this really true? Did an assassin really kill Woo Gunsang?!\u201dIt was unbelievable news. But there was no reason not to believe it.It was a letter from the Qingcheng sect, not anywhere else. They had no reason to lie to the Emei sect.\u00a0\u201cUnbelievable!\u201dAs Guhwasata clenched her fists, the letter was crumpled and ripped.\u00a0\u201cMaster, has Woo Gunsang really been assassinated?\u201dJeonghwa asked carefully.She was one of the few people who shared the secret with the Elderly Master of Brilliance.\u00a0Of course, she knew the full story of this event.\u00a0\u201cShit! An inescapable net was laid out to capture them, but on the contrary, they managed to sneaked into Qingcheng sect and assassinated Woo Gunsang?!.\u201dBang!Guhwasata smashed the desk with her fist.In her anger, Jeonghwa, Cheolsim, Yong Seol-ran and the other disciples held their breath.Due to the death of Woo Gunsang, the picture drawn by the Guhwasata was completely destroyed.It was because of his tremendous talent that Guhwasata commissioned the Blood Phantom Group to assassinate Woo Gunsang.\u00a0There was a gap that was difficult to narrow between the Qingcheng sect and the Emei sect. Furthermore, there\u2019s a sense of crisis that she will never be able to catch up with the Qingcheng sect given that Woo Gunsang\u2019s talent was fully blooming.\u00a0 It caused her to feel unbelievable pressure.\u00a0500,000 gold was by no means a small amount. This was especially true with Emei\u2019s current situation. Nevertheless, she invested such a large amount because she recognized the appearance of a Woo Gunsang as a threat.She did an investigation of the establishment of Woo Gunsang.\u00a0even more so in Nevertheless, he invested such a large amount because he recognized the image of a friend as a threat.She thoroughly investigated the actions of the allies.In the process, an unexpected fact was revealed. It was that he was terribly greedy for female colors.Then I had that thought.The 500,000 nyang paid to the blood corps was nothing at all, saying that if it were possible, the friendship statue could be used in a way that would be beneficial to the Ami factions.Guhwasata had a beautiful disciple named Yong Seol-ran.\u00a0Yong Seol-ran both possesses great beauty and intelligence. There was also her cool temperament and blade-like judgment that other disciples did not have.She thought that it would not be too difficult for her to control Woo Gunsang.The Elderly Master of Brilliance did not stop with the assassination plan while she was promoting the marriage of Yong Seol-ran and Woo Gunsang.If Woo Gunsang had refused to marry, the assassination would have proceed.\u00a0Woo Jinpyeong, Woo Gunsang\u2019s father, was not an easy-going person. He did not readily accept the marriage proposal of Emei.\u00a0Because he, too, knew that the marriage with the Emei sect would do more harm than good.It was only recently that the situation changed.Woo Gunsang had a major accident, and Woo Jinpyeong realized clearly that his son should not be left alone like this. So, he ended up accepting the marriage offer of the Emei sect.As soon as the conversation between Woo Gunsang and Yong Seolran was made, Guhwasata cancelled the assassination request. And in order to destroy the evidence, she moved the warriors of Sichuan to attack the Blood Phantom Group assassins.\u201cIt was cooked rice, but how dare you sprinkle ashes\u2026\u201dFire seemed to be burning in the eyes of Guhwasata.If Yong Seol-ran and Woo Gunsang had gotten married as planned, they would have dominated the Emei sect within ten years.But all of her plans went awry because of a mere assassin.All the plans that were created for seven years were ruined.Jeonghwa said,\u201cWe must not leave the assassin who killed Woo Gunsang live. They may know our secret, so we must get rid of them.\u201d\u201cYou must immediately lead the disciples and participate in the inescapable net immediately. You must kill that assassin.\u201d\u201cLeave it to me.\u201dJeonghwa led her brothers and sister disciples out.It was time for Yong Seolran to naturally follow them outside.\u201cNow that the marriage has been cancelled, you must be overjoyed, aren\u2019t you?\u201dThe sharp voice of Guhwasata stopped\u00a0 her.When Yong Seol-ran turned back, Guhwasata was looking at her with cold eyes.Yong Seol-ran answered calmly.\u201cOf course not. There is no way I am glad that I lost my husband.\u201d\u201cHusband?\u201d\u201cWe decided to marry, so he is my husband\u201dYong Seol-ran bowed her head at Guhwasata and went outside.* * *Everything regarding the Qingcheng sect has turned into his enemy.In fact, the whole sect couldn\u2019t be his enemy, but it was what Pyo-wol felt. Everything in the Qingcheng sect seemed to be aiming at him with hostility.The death of Woo Gunsang of the Qingcheng sect was revealed much earlier than Pyo-wol had expected.He expected that the pursuit of the Qingcheng sect would start in the morning, but in reality, less than half an hour later, the masters of the Qingcheng sect had already begun to move.\u00a0It was a much quicker response than Pyo-wol had calculated.On the other hand, Pyo-wol\u2019s physical condition was the worst.Due to the confrontation with Woo Gunsang, his body was seriously injured.Not only external wounds, but his internal injuries as well were in critical condition. He wanted to hide somewhere for just a moment. But he wasn\u2019t given even a small amount of time.Pyo-wol hurriedly went down the mountain after he barely stopped the bleeding. But he had to change direction before going down half a mile. It was because the masters from the nearby area were blocking the way.Bark bark!The sound of a dog barking echoed from somewhere. Even the dogs raised in the sect were mobilized to track down Pyo-wol.\u2018I have to get rid of the smell.\u2019As it was, it was clear that his actions would soon be discovered.Pyo-wol turned his body in the direction where he felt the strong moisture. As he walked along, following the damp smell, a small valley came out.Pyo-wol moved along the valley.He could not help but try to remove his body odor as much as possible.Fortunately, the barking of the dog was no longer heard. It was because the water removed the body odor of Pyo-wol.\u00a0But a bigger challenge awaited him.\u201cBlock the valley.\u201d\u201cSet up a checkpoint over here.\u201dIn the nearby area, the warriors were sent to prevent anyone from going out of the valley.The martial arts skills of the warriors didn\u2019t seem that great. Unlike the previous disciples who were training in the main mountain, they only learned a little bit of martial arts for self-defense.\u2018I have to break through.\u2019Choosing to go on a detour would be a waste of time. It was safe to say that they were guarding only all the way up to this point, since it was filled with warriors.\u00a0It would have been better for him to break through head-on before their encirclement was completed.With his judgment made, he quickly acted on it.Pyo-wol rushed towards the warriors in an instant.\u201cThere\u2019s the assassin!\u201d\u201cStop!\u201dBy the time the warriors noticed Pyo-wol\u2019s existence, he had already come close.Puverbuck!\u00a0Pyo-wol\u2019s attacks exploded on their necks and stomachs.In an instant, three or four warriors collapsed.The warriors, who had deflected Pyo-wol\u2019s attack, hurriedly fired firecrackers into the air.Pyo-wol gave up attacking and ran away.\u201cThis way\u2013!.\u201d\u201cThe assassin has fled this way!\u201dSeeing the firecrackers, many of the warriors ran towards him.\u00a0All the people in Mt. Qingcheng chased after Pyo-wol.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There should also be someone who can carve out assassins\u2019 infiltration method and another person to figure out the escape routes.A minimum of four personnel were required for one assassination.That was just the case for the minimum.\u00a0On average, more than a dozen personnel actually have to move organically and assist in executing a single assassination. Because of that, assassin groups like the Blood Phantom Group have been able to prosper until now.For nearly two hundred years, Jianghu has been involved in great wars such as the Battle of Blood and the War of the Demons and Heaven. Assassin groups such as the Blood Phantom Group expanded their power by taking advantage of such chaos.After the two battles, the assassin group became more and more professional and systematic.If the Blood Phantom Group had been fine, Pyo-wol would have been able to receive systematic support. However, Pyo-wol did not think that the Blood Phantom Group would be okay.The client was meticulous and cruel. There was no way for them to feel any remorse.Pyo-wol had to do both assassination and escape by himself.Even with his injured body.The escape route Pyo-wol chose was the Min River (\u5cb7\u6c5f Minjiang).The Min River was a huge river flowing behind Mt. Qingcheng and passed through the Sichuan Basin. The richness of the Sichuan Basin was due to sediments brought from upstream by four great rivers, including the Min River.Four rivers, hence the name Sichuan. The four rivers were connected through numerous tributaries and connected the entire Sichuan province like a spider\u2019s web.That was why Pyo-wol chose Min-gang as his escape route.Similarly, the martial artists of the Qingcheng sect knew this, so they built a security network on the escape route leading to the Min River.\u201cThere!\u201dThe warriors who discovered Pyo-wol attacked.Pyo-wol chose to avoid them rather than confront them head-on. Pyo-wol made a big detour and ran towards the Min River.\u00a0A field of reeds could be seen in the distance.Once he hides himself in the reed fields and enters the Min River, the pursuers will not be able to find him easily.\u201cOkay\u2014.\u201dBut before Pyo-wol could even enter the reed field, a large axe flew.\u00a0Bang!A crater the size of an adult\u2019s torso exploded in the place where Pyo-wol had just been. If Pyo-wol had been a little late to avoid it, he would have been smashed like fish meat.Blood Dragon Blade Lighting (\u8840\u9f8d\u5f3a\u592b).He was a master who had no opponent if he only had an axe.As soon as he heard that Gunsang was assassinated by an assassin, he ran to this place with his axe.When he found Pyo-wol, he swung his axe with all his might.\u201cHow dare an assassin dare to kill Qingcheng\u2019s Woo Gunsang! I will punish you by offering your corpse as a sacrifice on the altar of the Qingcheng sect!\u201dHe was genuinely angry.Although he had no relationship with Woo Gunsang, the fact that the young disciple who carried the future of the sect had his life ended in vain because an assassin, made him angry.It wasn\u2019t just that.Most of the warriors who supported the Qingcheng\u2019s call and formed the inescapable net had similar feelings.Hong Hong!A huge axe flew with a vicious momentum.Pyo-wol did not dare to face the axe and fled. Then, this time, something invisible flew aiming for Pyo-wol\u2019s blood.Pyo-wol almost instinctively bowed his head. Then something invisible ran through his hair and back.A handful of hair was cut off, and the hem of his clothes was torn, revealing his bare skin.\u2018Fishing line?\u2019It was a fishing line that was so fine that it was indistinguishable by the naked eye that attacked Pyo-wol.\u00a0The owner of the fishing line was an old man in his sixties dressed as a fisherman.The old man\u2019s true identity was So Tae-myung, the Min River\u2019s Fish (\u7720\u6c5f\u6f01\u7fc1).So Tae-myung\u2019s weapon was a fishing rod called a Dragon Pole [\uc6a9\uac04\uc870(\u9f8d\u7aff\u64cd)]. The fishing rod itself was ordinary, but the fishing rod was made of a material called Cheonjamsa (silk thread).1The Cheonjamsa was so thin that it was almost invisible to the naked eye, and its sharpness was comparable to that of a famous sword.Jo Pyeong-gwang and So Tae-myung were old friends.One attacked from a close range with an axe, and the other attacked from a distance using a fishing rod.Their collaboration was truly perfect.Pyo-wol realized that he couldn\u2019t get to the Min River until he defeated them.Pyo-wol ran towards So Tae-myung.\u201cHeh! This will be easy. Someone who\u2019s an assassin baboon\u2026\u201dWhir-lik!So Tae-myung snorted and recovered the dragon pole. Then the fishing line returned and aimed at Pyo-wol\u2019s back.The hooks on the fishing line were so sharp that once caught, it was impossible to get out.Pyo-wol knew that too.Still, he ran away without blinking an eye.Both the number of years of learning martial arts and the level of skill was quite different. Still, the reason Pyo-wol rushed to the front was because he had an intuition that the opportunity would not come if he didn\u2019t go for it now.Pyo-wol\u2019s nerves were at a standstill.As his sight, smell, and hearing expanded beyond my limits, he felt the trembling of the air.The movement of the fishing line sharply piercing the air was vividly pictured in my mind.Pyo-wol stretched out his hand.The fishing line was caught on his thumb and index finger.Bang!\u201cYou fool!\u201dAt that moment, So Tae-myung pulled the fishing rod with all his might.His fishing line was made of silk yarn. By injecting the internal energy, it can become sharper than any other famous swords.Human skin could also be cut in half like a fish body.So Tae-myung had no doubts that he could cut off Pyo-wol\u2019s hand. However, the thumb and index finger of Pyo-wol, who grabbed the fishing line, were still intact.\u201cWhat?\u201dSo Tae-myung opened his eyes wide in surprise.The unthinkable happened to him.Pyo-wol\u2019s internal strength could hardly keep up with the depth of So Tae-myung. Moreover, the piece called Cheonjamsa was added, so his finger should have been cut off.\u00a0Nevertheless, his fingers remained intact because he concentrated all of his internal strength on the two fingers holding the Cheonjamsa.In other words, it was a matter of efficiency.While the depth and vastness of the action did not need much internal energy, the delicateness needed for the operation was different.Pyo-wol possessed a more sensitive sense than anyone else.As he struggled to survive in the dark, his senses expanded. Such expanded senses were so sensitive that the average person could not even imagine.When So Tae-myung pulled the fishing rod, he came closer, and when he swung it, he followed him like a scarecrow.Pyo-wol was like a ghost hanging from a fishing line.He had killed a lot of warriors with the dragon pole so far, but this was the first time this has happened.\u201cBastard!\u201dJo Pyeong-gwang suddenly attacked Pyo-wol\u2019s waist with an axe. At that moment, Pyo-wol let go of the fishing line he was holding in his hand and jumped forward.Because of the action of Jo Pyeong-gwang, Pyo-wol used his momentum to go for So Tae-myung\u2019s chest.\u201cOh no\u2014!\u201dSo Tae-myung hurriedly tried to block Pyo-wol\u2019s attack with the handle of the dragon pole. But before the dragon pole\u2019s handle reached, Pyo-wol gently pushed it away with his palm.In an instant, So Tae-myung\u2019s body was out of balance. Without missing the gap, Pyo-wol\u2019s hand pierced his throat like tofu.He executed the Seventy-Two Swords with his bare hands like a blade.\u00a0After listening to So Yeowol\u2019s advice, Pyo-wol concentrated on his handiwork. And he was able to get some results.He can make his fingers reminiscent of a sharp blade at will.The result was right before his eyes.Pyo-wol\u2019s hand stopped So Tae-myung\u2019s breathing. So Tae-myung collapsed in his blood.\u201cTae-myung!!\u201dA voice close to the scream of Jo Pyung-gwang, the Blood Dragon, resounded in the Min River. He never could have imagined that he would lose a close friend in such a vain way in front of his eyes.Pyo-wol ignored Jo Pyeong-gwang.There was no time to deal with Jo Pyung-gwang now.He picked up So Tae-myung\u2019s dragon pole and flew into the Min River.Plop!In an instant, his figure disappeared into the river.\u201cDamn it!\u201dJo Pyung-gwang\u2019s desperate cry echoed through the Min River.\u201cHe jumped into the river!\u201d\u201cFollow him!\u201dThe soldiers who joined late followed Pyo-wol and plunged into the river.Jo Pyung-gwang cried while holding the body of his dead friend.\u201cDamn! I will never forgive you!\u201d* * *The Qingcheng sect organised a tracking team of about 100 men to pursue Pyo-wol. However, the rest of the warriors were not idle. They coordinated in achieving their goal by closely liaising with the warriors of other sects.The people who led the pursuit from the Qingcheng sect were Mu Jeong-jin and his disciple Qing Ming.If Mu Jeong-jin was the number one martial artist in the Qingcheng sect, Qing Ming possessed an unparalleled force among his fellow disciples.Although he was not as famous, because of his brilliant talent, his martial arts skills were among the top three of his great disciples.Qing Ming had another talent besides martial arts, which was that he was good at hunting.Before entering the Qingcheng sect, he lived with his father, who was a hunter.From the moment he started walking, he went with his father, so he inherited his father\u2019s talents.Knowing the nature of the beast, tracking, and hunting skills were at a level that even hunters could not match. Thanks to his talent, he was able to catch the eye of Mu Jeong-jin early and became his disciple.Knowing the talent of Qing Ming, Mu Jeong-jin set out to pursue Pyo-wol with him in the lead.After examining the traces left on the floor, Qing Ming opened his mouth.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s a great guy. He\u2019s bold and fearless on the subject being chased.\u201d\u201cIf he wasn\u2019t, he wouldn\u2019t have dared to assassinate Woo Gunsang. Can you track him down?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dQing Ming answered in a confident voice. It has been more than ten years since he gave up on hunting, but his skill was still there.Rather than worrying about not being able to track him, he was rather excited about hunting after a long time.\u2018Now that Woo Gunsang has died, this is a golden opportunity.\u2019Qing Ming was very ambitious. However, it was difficult for him to express his ambitions since the position of Woo Gunsang or his older brother, Qing Yeobeun was so strong.In particular, Woo Gunsang was younger than him, and he was loved by the elders for his superior talent.Qing Yeobeun, his older brother, received the full support of the disciples for his outstanding martial arts and gentle personality.Because the two had the love and attention of the entire Qingcheng sect, there was no room for him to intervene. So Qing Ming was giving up on it to some extent. But suddenly the opportunity came.Qing Ming did not want to miss the opportunity that suddenly came.\u201cLet\u2019s go! We must catch him to lift up the spirit of the sect!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dQing Ming took the lead and ran.He tracked down Pyo-wol, recalling his memories of hunting with his father.Where Pyo-wol had passed, traces remained.Pyo-wol preferred to get out of hiding if possible, and he did so. However, it was near impossible to get out of the inescapable net that was spread out like spider webs throughout Sichuan Province without any trace.Pyo-wol fought a few fights, used his wits and escaped, but he left a trail each time.Qing Ming found the ghost like traces left by Pyo-wol.\u00a0\u201cHe turned around here.\u201d\u201cWhere will he go after coming here?\u201d\u201cHe will end up in Danba (\u4e39\u5df4). If you go further west from Danpa, you will find the highlands.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a clever guy. The other guys died trying to escape out of Sichuan, but he\u2019s doing the opposite of trying to escape by going deep into Sichuan.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 If his destination is really the highlands, we will have to catch him before he gets there. The mountains there are too steep and deep, and if he made up his mind to hide, we will never be able to find him.\u201dMu Jeong-jin nodded his head at Qing Ming\u2019s concern.The Sichuan land was basically a basin.The vast plain, which provides enough grain to feed hundreds of millions of people, was protected by mountains high enough to reach the sky like a folding screen.Among them, the highland in the west was famous for its rugged and dense mountains. Even in broad daylight it was as dark as night, and it was notorious for having first-time visitors to get lost and wander for days and days, eventually starving to death.Mu Jeong-jin gave another disciple an order.\u201cMake an announcement to the sects that have made up the inescapable net. Since his destination is the western highlands, tell them to concentrate and fully prepaare their forces there, especially for those sects in that direction.\u201d\u201cUnderstood. I\u2019ll tell them that.\u201dThe disciple lowered the large box he was carrying on his back as he answered.Inside the box were dozens of well-trained carrier pigeons.\u00a0The disciple took some of them out of the box then threw them away.The carrier pigeons flew in different directions with a letter containing the orders of Mu Jeong-jin on their feet.It was time for the warriors of the Qingcheng sect to start moving again after a brief rest.Suddenly, a red hawk appeared in the sky.The red hawk hovered in the sky for a while, then swiftly descended and landed on the forearm of the disciple who sent out the carrier pigeons.\u00a0The disciple hurriedly delivered the letter tied to the carrier pigeon\u2019s ankle to Mu Jeong-jin.\u201cThis is a letter from the Emei sect.\u201d\u201cEmei?\u201dMu Jeong-jin hastily read the letter.\u201cMaster, why did Emei send a letter?\u201d\u201cThey say they want to participate too.\u201d\u201cEmei? What are their intentions\u2026\u201dQing Ming frowned.His perception of the Emei sect was not good.Mu Jeong-jin crumpled up the letter and said,\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what their intentions are. What\u00a0 matters is that the number of cards we can use has increased. We will surely catch the assassin and soon have him taste the pain of hell.\u201dEven if the translated chapters hasn\u2019t caught yet with the manhwa, it\u2019s nice to see some events here in the webnovel which was not shown in the manhwa~Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 31": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 31Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe whole world was tinged with gold.The rice fields before harvest swayed like waves in the wind, and the farmers smiled happily.Their faces were tanned by the intense sunlight, and their whole body was sweating non-stop, but they were happy nonetheless.Now the harvest is near.The end of the arduous journey that has continued since spring is in sight. That is why the working farmers burst into laughter.\u00a0They failed to notice that someone was stealing the clothes they had left on the farm road.It was Pyo-wol who walked calmly while changing into farmer\u2019s clothes. He hung his sickle around his waist and walked like a real farmer.Because of that, even the peasants didn\u2019t think it was strange at all when they saw him.Pyo-wol acted like a real farmer.He thoroughly imitated the behavior of farmers, even their facial expressions.One of the things Pyo-wol learned in order to survive in the dark was to imitate others.It was So Gyeoksan who taught him the art of imitation.So Gyeoksan was from an arts troupe that performed miscellaneous plays. He was particularly good at changing his face in an instant.He said that the audience cannot be immersed in a miscellaneous drama simply by changing their face. The audience can only sympathise deeply when they act like an object with a completely changed face, and the key is to think from the perspective of the owner of the face.Pyo-wol had to think and act thoroughly in the position of the owner of the face.Imitation was the starting point.It had to be the subject of thorough imitation.So Gyeoksan said it in passing, but his words were deeply engraved in Pyo-wol\u2019s mind. After that, Pyo-wol had a habit of observing and imitating the actions of others.Its true value was being demonstrated now.Even now, the warriors were frantic as they tried to look for him everywhere, but Pyo-wol himself was walking with a relaxed mind like a farmer.Pyo-wol looked at the golden fields with a heartwarming smile like a real farmer.He was truly amazed at the magnificent spectacle he had seen before.He had quite a lot of experience wandering the river alone as a child, but he had never seen such spectacular scenery.Pyo-wol thought that the scene in front of him was beautiful.He himself wanted to become a farmer and live a peaceful life like this.But he knew best how vain his wishes were.On the way here, Pyo-wol had the blood of many people buried in his hands. In most cases, they were the ones who attacked first, but in some cases, Pyo-wol was the first one to sneak and kill them.As long as their blood is on his hands, he will not be given a peaceful life.Pyo-wol shook his head and threw away his thoughts.He was simply pretending to be a farmer, but he was too immersed in it.Pyo-wol walked hurriedly.\u00a0Because he wanted to get out of this situation.It was when he reached the end of the farm road.\u201cIt\u2019s a message from the Qingcheng sect that the assassin is moving west. Everyone block the road around here.\u201dA group of warriors appeared and blocked all the farm roads leading out of the paddy fields.Pyo-wol\u2019s expression hardened.It was not simply because they blocked their way, but because of the fact that someone from the Qingcheng sect accurately grasped his path and gave instructions.\u00a0\u2018I have to get out of this place in at least an hour.\u2019If they blocked this place, the other roads would also be guarded by soldiers.He had to get out when the security was still loose.Pyo-wol approached the warriors blocking the farm road with the most casual look.\u201cStop!\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dPyo-wol looked at the soldiers with a frightened expression.He looked like a real farmer.\u201cWe are searching for a criminal who has committed a grave sin. State your identity this instant!\u201d\u201cMy name is\u00a0 Yangcheol, who lives in the village over there. I\u2019m on my way home from farming today.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s still this early, are you saying you\u2019ve already finished farming?\u201d\u201cYes! All the weeds have been cut, so everything is done for the day.\u201dThe soldiers who saw Pyo-wol\u2019s frightened appearance made a lost impression. No matter how fearless they were in the world, they could not handle innocent civilians at will.To them, Pyo-wol looked like a real farmer.Pyo-wol rubbed mud all over his body, and changed his face to the opposite.His appearance was like any other rural villager.Gu Yeonseong, the leader of the warriors, looked closely at Pyo-wol.Gu Yeonseong was from the Emei sect and was favored by Guhwasata, the Abbess of Nine Calamities, because of his excellent martial arts and observation skills.\u201cWhat shall we do?\u201dThe soldiers under his command waited for Gu Yeonseong\u2019s instructions.\u201cLet him pass.\u201dAt Gu Yeonseong\u2019s command, the soldiers paved the way.It was when Pyo-wol almost passed them by.\u201cFor a moment!\u201dSuddenly, Gu Yeonseong stopped Pyo-Wol.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cWhy is the sickle of someone who came back from cutting weeds so clean? If you cut weeds, then there must be some sort of traces on the sickle.\u201dPyo-wol\u2019s eyes shook for a moment. He didn\u2019t expect that Gu Yeonseong would be able to notice such a small detail.\u00a0Gu Yeonseong did not miss Pyo-wol\u2019s reaction.\u201cYou must be the assassin the Abbess of Nine Calamities was talking about! Attack him!\u201dAt the command of Gu Yeonseong, the soldiers who were guarding the road rushed towards Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol heard what Gu Yeonseong said even as he avoided the attacks of the warriors.\u00a0\u2018Abbess of Nine Calamities?\u2019He has dealt with many people so far, but no one has mentioned the name of a specific person before. Pyo-wol instinctively noticed that Gu Yeonseong had a different purpose than the other people he had faced.Originally, he was planning to escape as soon as his identity was discovered. However, as soon as he heard Gu Yeonseong\u2019s words, he changed his mind.Ciit!The sickle, which played a decisive role in revealing his identity, broke through the air.\u201cGAH!\u201dBlood gushed out from the neck of the man who was running in front of him.Pyo-wol beheaded his head with a simple swing without much of an afterthought.\u00a0Poeng!The man in the back threw firecrackers into the air. It was a signal that the assassin was on their location. Pyo-wol expected that sooner or later a flock of soldiers would come running to his location.There was no time to waste.He had to subdue the group in front of him as fast as possible to find out what they wanted.Shiak!Pyo-wol threw the sickle at the rushing enemies.\u201cHmph\u2013!\u201d\u201cYou dare!\u201dThe warriors used qi and simply dodged the sickle.Avoiding such attacks was easy for them.\u201cDamn! It would be better for you to give up!\u201dThey rushed towards Pyo-wol in an instant. At that moment, Pyo-wol flew backwards and clapped his fingers.A gleam of suspicion shone on Gu Yeonseong\u2019s face.Because Pyo-wol\u2019s actions seemed meaningless.That was then.Ciit!A horrifying sound rang out from behind their backs.\u201cKurgh!\u201d\u201cUrrgh!\u201dThe soldiers behind Gu Yeonseong screamed.\u201cWhat?\u201dAs Gu Yeoseong looked back in surprise, he saw the soldiers who were following him suddenly fall down with blood pouring from their necks.It was the sickle that had just been dodged that had decapitated them.The sickle, as if a living creature, came back in a large curve in the air and landed in Pyo-wol\u2019s hand.\u201c\u2013Huh, how?\u201dAt that moment, Pyo-wol once again threw his sickle.\u00a0Gu Yeonseong instinctively swung his sword and deflected the sickle.\u00a0Pyo-wol lifted his finger. The sickle, which was about to fall on the ground, flew towards Gu Yeonseong again at a frightening speed.The handle of the sickle was connected to a thread so thin that it was invisible to the naked eye. It was So Tae-myung\u2019s fishing line that Pyo-wol stole after killing him.\u00a0\u00a0The silver thread was made of Cheonjamsa (silk thread) so fine that it was hard to distinguish it with the naked eye, and was as sharp as any other famous sword.\u201cSuch a waste\u2014\u201dGu Yeonseong, who finally understood the situation, exploded in anger.\u00a0He performed the Nanchi Wind Sword Technique1, one of the best techniques of the Emei sect, and strictly defended his whole body.However, Pyo-wol\u2019s real target was not the sickle.His left hand pulled the blade out of his waist and threw it. It was the weapon of an unknown man whom Pyo-wol killed while escaping from the inescapable net.\u00a0Peuck!\u201cKeuk!\u201dThe blade was precisely nailed in Gu Yeonseong\u2019s shoulder.The unpredictable attack disturbed the Gu Yeonseong\u2019s posture.Pyo-wol did not miss the gap and adjusted his sickle using the silk thread to attack Gu Yeonseong\u2019s left leg.The sickle cut precisely the Gu Yeonseong\u2019s popliteal tendon.\u201cKurgh!\u201dIn the end, Gu Yeonseong screamed and collapsed.Pyo-wol climbed on Gu Yeonseong\u2019s chest and wrapped his neck with the Cheonjamsa thread.\u201cKekhuek!\u201dGu Yeonseongcouldn\u2019t even scream and let out a strange moan.The fear of having the thread digging into his neck little by little made him contemplate.\u201cSah, save me\u2026\u201d\u201cWho is the Abbess of Nine Calamities?\u201d\u201cT-that, keuk!\u201dWhen Gu Yeonseong hesitated, Pyo-wol gave the thread more power. Then, silk thread further dug deeper into the throat of the Gu Yeonseong.\u00a0\u201cGu, Guhwasata, the Abbess of Nine Calamities! The sect leader of Emei sect!\u201d\u201cThe Emei sect\u2019s Abbess of Nine Calamities?\u201d\u201cY\u2026Yes! I answered your question\u2014 my\u2026my life\u2013\u201d.\u201cDid the Abbess of Nine Calamities directly commanded you?\u201d\u201cNot only me, but all of the disciples of the Emei sect! We were ordered to help the Qingcheng sect capture the assassin, no matter what!\u201d\u201c In the first place, was the Emei sect always so active and helpful towards the Qingcheng sect?\u201d\u201cN\u2026Not really. We were originally like cats and dogs before\u2026 So I thought it was strange.\u201d\u201cYou thought it was strange?\u201d\u201cY-Yes\u2026 That\u2019s\u2026\u201dGu Yeonseong faithfully answered all of Pyo-wol\u2019s question.The purpose was somehow to pass time.Even at this moment, the martial artists who saw the firework signal would be running. He thought that he would likely survive if he just took the time until they arrived. So he talked about everything he knew.Pyo-wol listened to him without missing any detail. Even the minor things.\u2018It\u2019s her\u2026\u2019All of the pictures that used to be torn apart in his head were now put together.Someone who knows Woo Gunsang.\u00a0Someone who feels inferior towards him.\u00a0Someone who has the patience to invest seven years\u2019 worth of time.\u00a0A person who possesses enough wealth to pour a huge amount of money into the plan.\u00a0Someone based in Sichuan.Guhwasata, the Abbess of Nine Calamities, was an existence that satisfies all these conditions.There was no definite evidence, it was only his hunch. But Pyo-wol was confident that his guess was certain.\u201cOver there!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s him!\u201dA group of soldiers appeared from the other side of the road.They were the ones who saw the fireworks and followed the signal.Gu Yeonseong looked at Pyo-wol with a wicked grin.\u201cSince they\u2019re here, it\u2019s over for you as well! If you want to live, then release m\u2014\u201dScratch!In an instant, the Cheonjamsa thread cut off his neck like tofu.Gu Yeonseong lost his breath with a vicious smile on his face.Pyo-wol recovered the Cheonjamsa thread and got up.\u201cBastard!\u201d\u201cStay there!\u201dThe warriors were coming.Pop! Pop! Bang!Firecrackers bursted from all over the place, and whistles rang out.\u00a0Pyo-wol glanced at them and started running in the opposite direction.\u2018Abbess of Nine Calamities, right?\u2019\u2019She was the culprit in all of this.The ambitions of the Guhwasata drove the lives of Pyo-wol and the other children to hell.Regardless of his will, he was raised as an assassin, and the blood of countless people was buried in his hands.He will never be able to go back to his normal life again.All the martial artists of Sichuan were on his tail.\u00a0Even at this moment, the Qingcheng sect was suffocatingly coming towards him.Even if he can shake off those who were chasing right behind him, others will soon come and replace them.His desire will never end until he dies.\u2018Even if I were to die, I would not go to hell alone.\u2019If you want to bite a mad dog, you must be prepared to be bitten yourself.At this moment, Pyo-wol was like a mad dog.Now we know how and where Pyo-wol got the golden threads in the manhwa (ch23) which he used to choke the enemy (Gu Yeonseong).Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although their forces were shabby, they were still part of the axis where their skills were still considered as quite good since they inherited the martial arts of the Emei.The fact that the encircling net of the Qingyang Pavillion was breached in an instant meant that the assassin\u2019s skills were excellent.Jeonghwa\u2019s serious expression was not simply because the assassin\u2019s skills were excellent.The assassin\u2019s superior ability was evident from the assassination of Woo Gunsang. The fact that he managed to assassinate Woo Gunsang who was said to possess the best talent among the newer generation in Sichuan meant that the assassin\u2019s ability was excellent.Up to that point, Jeonghwa knew well.The problem was that the assassin grew stronger over time. She could tell just by looking at the bodies of those who had been assassinated. As more people chase him, the cleaner and more sophisticated the scars of the corpses become.She could tell by looking at how quickly he broke through the encircling net of the Qingyang Pavilion.\u00a0Although three of Qingyang Pavilion were insignificant, they were still strong in their own way. But the assassin was said to have broken through without taking any damage.At this level, the opponent could not be dismissed as an assassin who had only learned how to kill.\u201cYou\u2019re bound to see people who stand out wherever you go\u2026 but for a mere assassin\u2026 He must be eliminated. If you fail to get him, the repercussions will never end.\u201dAs soon as it is revealed that Emei, a prestigious sect, ordered the assassination of the recently departed Woo Gunsang of the Qingcheng sect, Jianghu\u2019s attention and criticism will be focused on them.\u00a0Even if it was not revealed, they cannot fall behind the Qingcheng sect. Or else the power of the Emei sect would be reduced even more.\u201cWhere did that person come from\u2026\u201dThey must first secure or eliminate the assassin before the world knows.The truth could be revealed if the Qingcheng sect captures the assassin first.\u00a0It was absolutely necessary to prevent such a situation.Jeonghwa gave orders to her junior sisters and other disciples.\u201cEveryone will chase after the assassin. Run with all your might and catch up with him.\u201d\u201cNo. We cannot capture him like that.\u201dAt that time, there was someone who interrupted her words.The dazzlingly beautiful woman was Yong Seol-ran.When her youngest junior sister dared to dispute her orders, Jeonghwa\u2019s expression became more venomous.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cLiterally. The assassin possesses greater abilities than we expected. Given that he was not caught even with the inescapable net focused on him proves that fact. If we continue to chase after him like this, we will never be able to catch him and we will only be seeing the back of his head.\u00a0\u201cHmph! Then what do you propose?\u201d\u201cWe should predict where he will go next.\u201d\u201cHow? Are you saying you know where he will go and that we\u2019ll wait there?\u201dIrrespective of Jeong-hwa\u2019s blunt reaction, Yong Seol-ran continued to speak calmly.\u201cI don\u2019t know the exact destination, but I can estimate the approximate location.\u201d\u201cHow?\u201d\u201cThe Blood Shadow Group2\u00a0trained assassins in a secret place at the request of the Emei sect. At that time, we deduced that the place where the Blood Shadow Group trained assassins was near Batang. Although we failed to pinpoint the exact location, we found out that a lot of supplies were supplied through the area.\u201dJeonghwa unconsciously listened to Yong Seol-ran.\u00a0The Emei sect\u2019s fate was at stake.\u00a0Of course, the minimum safety device had to be put in place. So, they tried to find out both the location of the home base of the Blood Shadow Group and the facility of the assassins who were trained to assassinate Woo Gunsang.\u00a0Nevertheless, both attempts failed. That\u2019s because the Blood Shadow Group moved secretly.But it wasn\u2019t completely unsuccessful.A lot of materials were needed to create the place where new assassins were trained. The Blood Shadow Group obtained materials from all over Sichuan Province, and it was discovered that the materials collected had flowed into Batang.\u201cBatang is adjacent to the western highlands. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll pass there.\u201d\u201cWhy do you think so?\u201d\u201cIt is said that some fish born in the rivers would go to the sea. And as they become adults in the sea, sooner or later they would end up returning to the place where they were born. Such an instinct is called the homing instinct. I think that assassin is also driven by his homing instinct.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know him personally myself, but the place he\u2019s most familiar with is probably the one where he was raised as an assassin. Of course he would think of it as the safest place.\u201d\u201cSo, are you sure he will pass through Batang?\u201d\u201cYes. He must be on the way to Batang.\u201d\u201cHuu\u2026\u201dJeonghwa let out a sigh.It was well known that Yong Seol-ran was outstanding.\u00a0Otherwise, it would not have been possible to directly adopt a disciple who was younger than her by skipping the recruitment period. But she really didn\u2019t expect that her brain was going to excel to this extent.\u00a0\u2018She\u2019s really a bitch who has it all.\u2019From the depths of her heart, a burning feeling arose which she knew was jealousy. But Jeonghwa tightly suppressed her emotions.\u00a0The rest of the disciples were watching.She cannot show the ugly jealousy she was feeling towards her junior sister else she would not be able to save face.\u00a0Jeonghwa said with a calm expression,\u201cYou have a point. All right. I\u2019ll follow your advice. But if we lose the assassin because of you, I\u2019ll hold you accountable. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dYong Seol-ran nodded her head with no fear on her face. Seeing her appearance like that made Jeonghwa even more pissed off.Jeonghwa gave orders to the disciples.\u201cWe will go to Batang first and wait for the assassin.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dJeonghwa and the Emei sect warriors got on the horse they had prepared in advance.Dozens of horses rushed towards the Batang with all their might.* * *Pyo-wol\u2019s face was filled with a tired light.\u00a0Pyo-wol was proud of his stamina, but no matter how strong he is, the fact that he could not take a proper rest and march through the force led to the exhaustion of his physical strength.\u201dHe had numerous wounds all over his body.It was a wound suffered in the process of breaking through the inescapable net.\u00a0Pyo-wol tried to break through the inescapable net without fighting as much as possible, but doing so was impossible in the first place.Fortunately, none of his injuries were fatal enough to render him unable to move.In his mind, he wanted to go hide somewhere and rest. But now that the inescapable net were becoming more and more dense, taking a break was no less than an act of suicide.Pyo-wol moved non-stop.He had a clear destination.He was using all of his six senses to reach his destination.Immediately after coming out of the underground cave, the Blood Shadow Group moved the children in a wagon that could not see the outside.During the long journey, they couldn\u2019t see the scenery outside so they didn\u2019t know which way to go.They had to let themselves stay in a wagon which was dark. The same was true for Pyo-wol. However, while resting as much as possible, he tried not to miss the outside path for even a single moment.He was in the carriage, but all of his senses were spread out wide. He remembered all environmental changes: the road conditions, the smell of the air, humidity and sounds.Pyo-wol was finding his way based on all that information.He didn\u2019t even know the name of the place he was passing by.He didn\u2019t know where the road would lead him to. However, he instinctively knew that if he followed this way, he could go to the place where he had been trained.Pyo-wol believed in his own instincts and senses.After living in the dark for seven years, his senses became mysteriously sensitive.It was thanks to his more developed and accurate senses that was way better than a beast that he had ever been able to survive. Pyo-wol\u2019s senses became more sensitive and sharp as he broke through the inescapable net.\u00a0It seemed like he was making progress while going through a life-and-death crisis.\u2018It is not that far.\u2019Pyo-wol sniffed the air.It was damp and had a characteristic musty scent. It was the same scent he smelled while riding in the wagon.Pyo-wol felt that his destination was near.A large village could be seen in the distance. He didn\u2019t know the name of the town, but he knew he had to make a detour.The problem was that there\u2019s a large river running through the village.A large river, more than twenty meters wide, was flowing in front of the village.Fortunately, there\u2019s a bridge leading to the village.It was when Pyo-wol had almost reached the bridge.Dududu!\u00a0Suddenly, a strong vibration was felt on the ground.\u00a0When he turned around, he saw a group of people running up to him leaving smoke and dust in the air.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s him!\u201d\u201cCatch him!\u201dThe people who ran while roaring were the martial artists of the Qingcheng sect led by Mu Jeong-jin.The warriors of the Qingcheng sect did not stop for a single moment and caught up with Pyo-wol. The moment he saw the uniform they were wearing, Pyo-wol immediately recognized their identities.\u2018Qingcheng sect!\u2019He knew he was going to be pursued, but he found it unexpected for them to be caught up so quickly.Although the distance was still far away, he felt an awful energy.\u00a0It was the energy that was radiated by Mu Jeong-jin who was at the forefront.The moment Pyo-wol saw him, he felt a strong sense of crisis.He instinctively realized that he was a master who was at a different level from any other warriors he had ever faced.\u2018He\u2019s an opponent I can\u2019t handle right now.\u2019His skin was tingling, as if being stabbed with an awl.Even though there were still hundreds of meters left between the two of them.He does not want to face him.\u00a0Pyo-wol turned his body and sprinted with all his might.\u201cDo you think I would let you escape?\u201dMu Jeong-jin roared like a lion and threw his sword.Sswaaang!His sword flew over hundreds of miles in an instant.Pyo-wol twisted his body at the last minute to avoid the ruthless sword.Bang!Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s sword struck deeply on the floor of the bridge with a deafening sound.\u00a0Pyo-wol felt goosebumps all over his body.It was clear what the result would have been if the sword had hit his body if he was too late to dodge.\u2018If I get caught in this state, I will die.\u2019A strong sense of crisis made Pyo-wol move even more. But when he almost reached the edge of the bridge, he had no choice but to stop.Because new warriors appeared from the other side.The group, which consisted mainly of women, was the Emei sect.\u201cHe\u2019s there!\u201dIt was Jeonghwa who shouted with a sharp voice at the forefront.Thick dust sat on the heads and shoulders of the disciples of the Qingcheng and Emei sect.\u00a0They have been chasing with their horses for half a day without a break. Even the horses were exhausted and collapsed because they ran with all their power. Thanks to that, they were able to arrive and wait in Batang faster than Pyo-wol.When Pyo-wol arrived, Jeonghwa was actually surprised. Because Yong Seol-ran\u2019s prediction was accurate.While admiring Yong Seol-ran\u2019s talent, she gave the orders to her disciples.\u201cYou must kill the assassin before the Qingcheng manage to capture him!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe Emei disciples rushed simultaneously towards Pyo-wol.The Qingcheng sect was behind Pyo-wol while the disciples of the Emei sect were running in front of him.\u00a0Since both sides were the forces that ruled Sichuan, they gave off terrifying energies.\u00a0Both sects harbored great hostility towards Pyo-wol. Their hostility and murderous intentions could be felt vividly through the air.Pyo-wol jumped into the river without hesitation.\u201cCatch him! You must not miss him.\u201d\u201cFollow him!\u201dAmong the disciples of the Emei and Qingcheng sect, those who were good at swimming followed Pyo-wol into the river.There was no hesitation in their actions.The faces of those who were chasing after Pyo-wol were filled with madness.\u201cHe\u2019s going upstream! Everyone, chase him!\u201dPyo-wol dived deep into the water and moved, but Mu Jeong-jin found out the direction where Pyo-wol was moving with his superhuman eyesight.The soldiers of the Qingcheng sect, who could not jump into the water, ran straight up the river.The soldiers of the Emei sect, who arrived late, hurriedly followed the soldiers of the Qingcheng sect.Jeonghwa approached Mu Jeong-jin and greeted him.No matter how urgent the situation was, she had to say hello because the distribution of the Qingcheng people in the area was far greater.\u201cEmei sect\u2019s Jeonghwa meets Qingcheng\u2019s Mu Jeong-jin.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re here too. How is the Abbess of Nine Calamities?\u201d\u201cYes. Thank you for your concern. Master has expressed her condolences on the death of Woo Gunsang, and ordered us to help the Qingcheng sect as much as possible.\u201d\u201cThank you. Please tell her we will not forget this favor.\u201d\u201cYes, I will surely deliver your words.\u201d\u201cBut how did the Emei sect know the assassin\u2019s path in advance and manage to come here first?\u201dMu Jeong-jin\u2019s eyes shone sharply. His eyes felt eerie, but Jeonghwa did not express any outward reaction.\u00a0\u201cIt was predicted by the youngest of our junior sisters.\u201d\u201cPredicted?\u201d\u201cYes. After gathering a lot of circumstantial evidence, she expected the assassin to escape here.\u201d\u201cAre you talking about the person who Gunsang was about to marry?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cWhat a pity! If such a child became the wife of a disciple from our sect, the whole of Sichuan would have been blessed.\u201d\u201cI share the same sentiment.\u201d\u201cI wish I could see her separately later. Would that be okay?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cOur talk has gone on too long. We\u2019ll continue our conversation later after we catch that assassin.\u201d\u201cYes. We will go first then.\u201dJeonghwa took the lead by running ahead first before Mu Jeong-jin.\u00a0Mu Jeongjin muttered as he looked at Jeonghwa\u2019s back face as she moved away,\u00a0\u201c\u2026They have other intentions.\u201dThe Emei sect he knew was not such a hateful sect.In particular, as the Qingcheng sect expanded rapidly, the Emei sect felt a sense of crisis and kept them in check. Although a friendly atmosphere has been formed in recent times because of the marriage talks, they have always been wary of the Qingcheng sect.The Emei sect actively going out to catch the assassin?It doesn\u2019t make sense.\u00a0The Emei sect that Mujeong-jin knew was not a sect that actively engaged in work that gave no benefits to them or whatsoever.Seeing them come out acting like this was enough proof that they have a different intention.\u2018Or is there something going on?\u2019Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s sharp gaze tenaciously followed Jeonghwa and Emei disciples.There will be a mass release for the free chapters today~ It will be up to chapter 36 to catch up with the manhwa!

    "Chapter 33": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 33Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe warriors of the Emei and Qingcheng sect were tenacious.They followed Pyo-wol like well-trained hounds. Their tenacity and tracking skills were different from the other martial artists who made up the inescapable net.\u00a0The Qingcheng sect pursuers, who lost Woo Gunsang because of Pyo-wol, possess great tracking skills. But it was actually the Emei sect who made his escape more difficult.The Emei sect\u2019s warriors were like ghosts who predicted and blocked his path.\u00a0\u2018There is someone in the Emei sect who possesses great intelligence.\u2019Otherwise, it would not be possible for them to block his path again and again.He wondered who was predicting his path, but he didn\u2019t have the time to leisurely find the answer to his questions.Chiiit!It was because there was a Qingcheng sect master who closed the distance between them and was sending attacks.\u00a0The master\u2019s name is Cheongseo (\uccad\uc11c).\u00a0He was one of the great disciples of the Qingcheng sect. His sword had a bluish energy.But it wasn\u2019t just Cheongseo.\u00a0All of the major disciples of the Qingcheng sect and the Emei sect were freely exercising their swordsmanship.They were all masters who took the normal steps and learned martial arts.That\u2019s how strong their basics and internal energy were.There was a big difference from Pyo-wol, who mainly learned how to assassinate. Pyo-wol only managed to survive because he had learned the Thunder-Splitting Cultivation Technique in great depths thus making his body react in time.\u00a0Sheik!With a small distance,\u00a0 the sword passed across Pyo-wol\u2019s cheeks.His skin cracked and blood spurted out, but Pyo-wol couldn\u2019t even dare to stop the bleeding and rolled to the floor.Poverbuck!\u00a0The sword was stuck one after another where he rolled.\u201cI will avenge disciple Woo Gunsang!\u201d\u201cThere is no place in the world for you to run away. Give up you bastard!\u201dThe warriors of the Qingcheng sect attacked Pyo-wol.\u00a0But instead of meeting their attacks head-on, Pyo-wol ran down the mountain road managing to avoid them with a short delay.The chase that started in the Western Highlands now continued to Batang.\u00a0If it hadn\u2019t been for the large trees that stood up thick and high making it so that there\u2019s no room for light to enter, Pyo-wol would have been captured by his pursuers.\u00a0In this dimly lit environment, Pyo-wol\u2019s ability was maximized.Large trees and thick bushes were used as cover as he moved.The warriors of the Qingcheng and the Emei sect did their best to catch up with Pyo-wol. However, even though it seemed like he would be caught at any moment, Pyo-wol escaped their grasp with just a small difference.\u00a0Huuung!A different level of pounding sound rang out.Pyo-wol instinctively recognized that it was an attack by Mu Jeong-jin. He didn\u2019t dare to fight back and just knelt down on the floor.\u00a0Suddenly, a strong energy grazed through his head.The energy that passed through Pyo-wol\u2019s head cut the tree in two.\u00a0It was a sword energy thrown by Mu Jeong-jin.\u2018Crazy!\u2019At the formidable power of the sword\u2019s energy, Pyo-wol felt his hair stand upright.\u201cDie!\u201dIt was already difficult to handle Mu Jeong-jin, but Jeonghwa decided to join as well.\u00a0She attacked Pyo-wol as if she were dealing with her sworn enemy. But her attack actually helped Pyo-wol. Because it was not an expected coordinated attack, her attack rather obstructed the path of Mu Jeong-jin.\u00a0\u201cTsk!\u201dMu Jeong-jin clicked his tongue at Jeonghwa\u2019s intervention.As much as possible, he wanted to capture Pyo-wol and drag him to the Qingcheng sect. This was so the assassin can reveal the mastermind behind the assassination.\u00a0This was also the reason why even when he attacked Pyo-wol, he refrained from killing him as much as possible.A lot of consideration was already given to the attack that Pyo-wol felt as threatening. However, when Jeonghwa intervened, it somehow touched his nerves.\u00a0Jeonghwa spread her internal energy without mercy.If she manages to land a hit once, she\u2019s going to launch a series of attacks that will cost Pyo-wol his life.Pyo-wol was in a dangerous situation. However, he escaped into the mountains, avoiding all attacks by a short interval.Mu Jeong-jin frowned.It was because he had doubts about the path of Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol was obviously running away.The masters of the Qingcheng and the Emei sect were closely following him, and the martial artists who spread the inescapable net were also quickly traversing the mountain one after another.No matter how deep he went into the mountains, there was no place for Pyo-wol to hide safely.\u2018There\u2019s no way he wouldn\u2019t know that fact\u2014 or does he have any other plans?\u2019That was then.Sheiik!Suddenly, the grass swayed, and someone jumped out and attacked Pyo-wol.It was Qing Ming, a disciple of Mu Jeong-jin, who attacked.Pyo-wol was unable to dodge his attack and received a blow on his shoulder.\u201cKurgh!\u201dPyo-wol let out a painful moan.He didn\u2019t even notice the attack by Qing Ming because he was only concerned about the attacks of Mu Jeong-jin and Jeonghwa.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s seriously injured! He won\u2019t be able to last long, hurry up and catch up!\u201dQing Ming shouted, wielding a sword stained with Pyo-wol\u2019s blood.Seeing Pyo-wol seriously injured, the warriors of the Qingcheng and Emei sect started to go on a frenzy.\u00a0Like a hound, they rushed towards Pyo-wol.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dYong Seol-ran looked at Pyo-wol, and involuntarily let out a sigh.It wasn\u2019t because she was cornered about him.Even though Pyo-wol was starting to be cornered, his eyes were too cold. It was by no means the kind of gaze that a person in extreme circumstances could have. Even in the midst of overlapping crises, his eyes were desperately looking for a way to live, and his body moved toward it.\u2018Would I be able to do that?\u2019Yong Seol-ran shook her head. She had no self-confidence to do so.\u00a0He\u2019s the kind of person that would not give up even if he gets hurt countless times and is cornered. The tenacity to live was something that Yong Seol-ran could never have.Bang!In an instant, an intense roar erupted.The energy released by Jeonghwa exploded on Pyo-wol\u2019s back.Pyo-wol spit blood and flew away.\u201cDie!\u201dJeonghwa gave off her characteristic venomous eyes and caught up with Pyo-wol. This time, she was definitely trying to cut off Pyo-wol\u2019s breath and get rid of the evidence.\u00a0Pyo-wol flew away like a kite with a broken thread.His head was lowered, as if he had lost consciousness.Because of that, Jeonghwa became a little careless. She thought she managed to capture Pyo-wol. But before being thrown to the floor, Pyo-wol opened his eyes and suddenly turned his body over.He instantly disappeared from their view.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe guy is gone.\u201dPyo-wol disappeared right before their eyes, and the warriors could not hide their puzzled expressions.\u201cWhere is he hiding?\u201dJeonghwa gritted her teeth and looked around. However, the presence of Pyo-wol was nowhere to be found.\u00a0Meanwhile, Mu Jeong-jin approached and said,\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s hiding somewhere around here, so search thoroughly.\u201d\u201cUnderstood!\u201dThe Qingchengs and Emei warriors searched the place where Pyo-wol disappeared.The secret was unraveled not long after.\u201cThere is an entrance that leads to the underground here.\u201d\u00a0The martial artists of the Qingcheng sect discovered the entrance that was hidden by the bushes.It was a vertical hole whose depth could not be measured.The large rock at the entrance of the cave was tied with a thick rope that could go down to the basement.\u201cTo think a place like this existed.\u201dMu Jeong-jin\u2019s eyes lit up.Given the circumstances, it was clear that Pyo-wol had gone down underground.\u00a0He shouted without hesitation.\u201cAll of you, climb down the rope. We must catch him no matter what.\u201d\u201cBy your order!\u201dThe disciples of the Qingcheng sect went down the vertical hole using the rope without any hesitation.Jeonghwa also gave an order.\u201cWe will go down as well. We must find the assassin and take his life.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe Emei sect\u2019s disciples also threw themselves into the darkness.Finally, Mu Jeong-jin threw himself into the hole that leads down the vertical cave.\u2018It\u2019s like I\u2019m descending to hell on my own.\u2019The unfathomable darkness made even a master like Mu Jeong-jin feel fear.Without the rope connected to the ground, he would have never come down here.He didn\u2019t know how long they actually descended, but it felt like it was hundreds of meters to the ground.\u201cHyuk!\u201dMu Jeong-jin, who finally landed on the floor, burst into exclamation without knowing it.The outline of the huge underground cave were faintly visible as the disciples who had come down before him were lighting their torches.Mu Jeong-jin could not help but be astonished at the vast space that could hardly be estimated.\u201cTo think there was a space like this.\u201dIt was a sight that the martial artists of the Qingcheng and Emei sect, who came down before him, had seen for the first time in their lives, so they were similarly overwhelmed.\u00a0\u201cOh my God!\u201d\u201cHow is this possible?\u201dThey looked around the place with their torches, but the underground was so vast that they couldn\u2019t see the end.Jeonghwa let out a sigh.\u2018Did the Blood Shadow Group nurture the assassins here? No wonder we couldn\u2019t find them, since they were in a place like this.\u2019She quickly realized the identity of this place.Jeonghwa\u2019s eyes shook as she scanned the underground cave.\u00a0A huge building stood in front of them.\u00a0She knew it the moment she laid eyes on the building.\u00a0\u2018The Qingcheng sect!\u2019\u2019The fact that that place was created by imitating the buildings of the Qingcheng sect.\u00a0Jeonghwa unconsciously looked at Mu Jeong-jin.\u201cHow dare they\u2014!\u201dAs she expected, Mu Jeong-jin also realized that the true identity of the buildings was the Qingcheng sect.\u00a0\u201cThose crazy bastards!\u201d\u201cIt feels like our sect has been moved as it is! They\u2019ve definitely been preparing for this for a long time!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to maintain such a facility like this without someone\u2019s support! Someone must have surely incited and protected them! They must be annihilated!\u201dThe anger of the Qingcheng warriors pierced the sky.Jeonghwa, on the other hand, turned her head and avoided their gaze.Qing Ming spoke to Mu Jeong-jin in a resentful voice.\u00a0\u201cWe must not let this slide, Master! We must find out the ones who are behind this and make them pay!\u201d\u00a0\u201cOf course. But before that, capturing the assassin takes priority. You have to catch him and send him back to our sect. Do you understand? Be sure to capture him.\u201d \u2018\u201cYes, Master!\u201d\u201cFrom now on, we will search this place thoroughly to find the assassin. This is like his home turf so be very careful.\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s just a single assassin. If we keep our vigilance, even he could not handle it.\u201d\u201cYou have to be careful though. He\u2019s not normal.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dAfter Qing Ming bowed his head to Mu Jeong-jin, he led his disciples to move.Jeonghwa came to the side of Mu Jeong-jin, who was now alone.\u201cI will lead our sect\u2019s disciples and search elsewhere.\u201d\u201cCapture him alive.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you cut off both of his arms or cripple him. However, make sure you capture him alive no matter what. You can do that, right?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cIf the assassin loses his life, I\u2019d be very angry. As you can see, someone dared to look down on our sect. I will definitely catch them and make them take responsibility. Even if the perpetrators are one of the Five Great Sects like us.\u201d\u00a0Jeonghwa swallowed dry saliva at the intense atmosphere that Mu Jeong-jin exuded.Even in the dark, Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s eyes shone like a firecracker, making even a master like Jeonghwa terrified.\u2018He is already suspicious of our sect.\u2019That\u2019s why he had mentioned the Five Great Sects.\u00a0In the past, it was called the Nine Great Sects, but now it has been shrunk into the Five Great Sects since some sects have disappeared.The reason Mujeongjinin dared to mention the Five Great Sects meant that he was suspicious of the Emei sect.Her heart was pounding, but Jeonghwa made an indifferent expression on her face. Fortunately, the darkness hid her expression to some extent.\u201cWhat you\u2019re worried about will never happen. I\u2019ll now take my leave.\u201d\u201cGo ahead.\u201dMu Jeong-jin waved his hand.After finishing their conversation, Jeonghwa left with the Emei sect\u2019s disciples.\u2018We must kill him. We must never leave any trails.\u2019If you make excuses that you couldn\u2019t help it because of the strong resistance after you kill him, even a ruthless person would have no choice but to do it.Jeonghwa said to the Emei disciples.\u201cYou must find and eliminate the scoundrel before the Qingcheng sect.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe Emei disciples answered with firm expressions on their faces. There were only a select few who knew the truth, including Jeonghwa and Yong Seol-ran.\u00a0The rest were simply responding to the unusual atmosphere around them.Yong Seol-ran shook her head slightly.A dark shadow was cast on her face.\u2018Everyone here is too optimistic.\u2019After entering the underground cave, she felt a strong sense of danger that cannot be expressed in words.She found it hard to breathe because of the unknown chill she was feeling.\u00a0It was as if the darkness was staring back at her.\u00a0\u2018This is his domain.\u2019\u00a0\u2018We are not the hunters in this place.\u2019\u2018He is.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And because of that, he was very hungry.Pyo-wol found and ate the food the children used to treasure.Thud! Thud!The sound of warriors descending using the ropes into the underground cave was heard over and over again.To them it was a light landing, but in Pyo-wol\u2019s ears it was as loud as thunder.As a rule of thumb, it seemed that more than a hundred martial artists had entered the underground cave. Still, Pyo-wol did not care and ate the food.It didn\u2019t matter how many people came in here. What really mattered for him was to quickly satisfy his hunger and replenish his stamina.\u00a0Pyo-wol ate until he was full.When his hunger dissipated, he seemed to be alive.\u00a0\u201cHuu\u2026!\u201dPyo-wol sighed and got up.\u00a0For a moment, he found his head spinning. He lost too much blood. Without a clear destination, he would never have been able to survive. It was only because of his strong will that he managed to reach this area.\u00a0This was the place where he spent a total of seven years. He even memorized the location of every stone and stalactite that existed here.\u00a0It was no accident that he came here.The martial artists of the Qingcheng and Emei sect were able to follow him all the way here. All of this is what Pyo-wol intended.\u00a0He purposely brought them here.\u201cLook around here.\u201d\u201cBe careful everyone.\u201dThe voices of the warriors were heard from not far away.They whispered quietly to others, but they couldn\u2019t fool Pyo-wol\u2019s ears.Pyo-wol quietly hid in the dark.Shortly thereafter, the warriors of the Emei sect appeared.They moved in groups of five.The sight of them moving little by little, illuminating the surroundings with the torch they held in their hand, was too cautious.\u00a0\u201cLook here. There are signs of food.\u201dOne of the disciples noticed the traces where Pyo-wol was staying and shouted.\u201cIt\u2019s clear he\u2019s not far away. Be careful everyone.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s an assassin. Remain vigilant because we will never know when he\u2019s going to attack.\u201dThey looked around with all their senses sharpened. However, there was a limit to the field of vision that a torch could secure.It was impossible to tell what was out of the range of the torch immediately.No matter how trained they were as martial artists, the pitch black darkness was enough to frighten them.The darkness stimulated their imaginations.They struggled to maintain their composure. Their sinister imagination slowly engulfed their minds like a plague.\u201cShit!\u201dOne of the martial artists clicked his tongue as he struggled to drive away the anxiety.\u2018Kuhk!\u2019His eyes widened at the sudden pain in his neck.Something sharp was squeezing his neck.He tried to scream, but his breath was choked and no sound came out. He could see the backs of his colleagues right in front of him.\u00a0He reached out and tried to grab his colleague\u2019s shoulders. But at that moment, his body was pulled up into the air like a radish.His colleagues ahead of him did not notice his disappearance at all.It was Pyo-wol who caught the martial artist.\u00a0In his hand was the Cheonjamsa thread.The martial artist, whose neck was wrapped around using the Cheonjamsa thread, had already stopped breathing.After hiding the body of the martial artist, Pyo-wol calmly followed the rest of the warriors who were ahead.As if they were their colleagues.The warriors who were leading the way did not notice that their comrades had already been replaced.Pyo-wol breathed like them, walked like them, and assimilated with them.As Pyo-wol sneaked in, none of the warriors of Emei noticed it.\u201cThere\u2026\u201dThe warrior, who was walking right in front of him, unexpectedly turned his head, as if he had something to say, and then opened his eyes wide.It was because an unfamiliar face, not a colleague, was following him.\u201cWho\u2014?\u201dPuuck!The warrior couldn\u2019t finish his words.It was because Pyo-wol stabbed his neck with the sword he had taken from the first warrior he had killed previously.\u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201dThe warriors, who noticed Pyo-wol\u2019s existence belatedly, looked back. But all they could see was the appearance of one of their colleagues falling down with blood dripping from his neck.Pyo-wol was nowhere to be seen.He disappeared into the dark in an instant.\u201cBastard!\u201dThey recklessly swung their swords towards the darkness. But nothing was being caught by their swords.\u00a0\u201cKurgh!\u201dThe one leading the group dropped his torch with a maddening scream. Pyo-wol, who had returned imperceptibly, broke his breath.\u00a0A light of horror appeared on the faces of the martial artists who had lost three of their companions in an instant.They did not know how they could have lost their colleagues like that so fast.\u00a0\u201cHeop!\u201dAgain, a scream bursted out.\u00a0Another warrior lost his life because of Pyo-wol\u2019s attack.The last warrior who was left alone shouted,\u201cCome out! You cowardly assassin! Don\u2019t just hide in the dark!\u201dUnable to overcome his fear, he swung his sword wildly.This was to prevent Pyo-wol from approaching by hiding in the dark.His sword ripped through the air like a madman\u2019s sword dance.Pyo-wol watched him in the dark. It was pathetic to see the man swinging his sword while leaning on the torch that had fallen on the floor.\u201cCome out! Come out!\u201dHe repeatedly shouted.\u00a0The man looked like he was going crazy.He had to see to attack or defend, but because of the thick darkness, he couldn\u2019t tell if someone was right next to him.\u00a0 The torch that had fallen to the floor was slowly extinguishing, losing its flame.\u201cOh, no!\u201dA light of despair appeared on the man\u2019s face.That dim torch was his lifeline. Even a fool knew what would happen if the light disappeared.\u00a0But his screams couldn\u2019t stop the torches from going out.Pssst!Finally, the torch was completely extinguished.Thud! Thud!At that moment, footsteps were heard.It was the sound of Pyo-wol\u2019s footsteps.He now didn\u2019t try to hide his presence.\u00a0Still, the remaining warrior did not know where Pyo-wol was located.The sound of footsteps bounced on the wall and echoed in all directions.Being able to adapt to the darkness, Pyo-wol was the perfect hunter.On the outside, he was in a position of being hunted given the inescapable net, but now the situation has completely changed.\u201cInsignificant assassin bastard\u2014 Huff! Houck!\u201dThe warrior let out a rough breath.Just by briefly swinging his sword, he was exhausted. He swung it with all his might rather than controlling his power because of the extreme fear.The man blinked.\u00a0Sweat got into his eyes.The warrior, who was rubbing his eyes with his sleeve, suddenly opened\u00a0 his eyes wide.An unfamiliar face appeared in front of him.Like a ghost, Pyo-wol appeared so suddenly.A pair of eyes with no emotion were staring straight into his eyes.\u00a0\u2018Snake?\u2019The warrior was reminded of a snake as he stared into Pyo-wolf\u2019s eyes. He couldn\u2019t move as if he was under a spell. All he had to do was raise his sword and stab him, but his body didn\u2019t listen.He was overwhelmed by the existence of Pyo-wol\u2018Keuk\u2013 no!\u2019Sueuk!Instantly, he felt a warm feeling spread into his stomach.An eerie, burning pain spread from his lower abdomen to his entire body.The sword of Pyo-wol was immeasurably lodged in his stomach.\u201cGurreuk!\u201dThe warrior was unable to move and foam began to rise from his mouth.\u00a0Pyo-wol looked at the collapsed warrior in front of him,\u00a0\u201cYou may rule the outside world, but the owner of this place is me.\u201dI will show you from now on.Who the owner of this place is.\u00a0There\u2019s nothing you can do.\u00a0* * *\u201cBastard!\u201dQing Ming1\u00a0lit the ground with his torch, looking for traces of Pyo-wol. However, no footprints were left anywhere on the floor.It was near impossible to track someone\u2019s footprints in such a dark place. More than two hundred people had entered the underground cave.\u00a0In their search for Pyo-wol, the traces they left behind were scattered and overlapped with his traces. In such an environment, it was almost impossible to find a Pyo-wol just by looking at the footprints.\u2018This is dangerous! This is his domain.\u2019Before coming here, Pyo-wol was nothing more than a prey that was being chased.\u00a0No matter how ferocious his claws were, he could not withstand hundreds or thousands of trained warriors. He showed his wits at the moment of crisis as he broke through the inescapable net with unexpected strength, but that was all.There was a limit to what one could do alone, and it was impossible to block thousands of trained warriors.\u00a0But here it was different.This was the domain of Pyo-wol.\u00a0He felt it from the moment he entered the underground cavity.That his smell is there.Staying only for a day or two could not make his scent this strong.\u2018This is his domain. He must have spent at least a few years here.\u2019He had goosebumps all over his body. The fact that he had them lured to this place even as he was desperately trying to escape made him shiver.It\u2019s not just about running away from danger and going to the place you think is the safest.\u2018He has a clear sense of purpose\u2026 He must have planned to rest here as his base.\u201dCould he have done this by himself?If it was simply running away and escaping, he could do the same. \u200b\u200bHowever, he will not dare to lure many martial artists who were tracking him in such a critical moment.He would rather have them all killed before proceeding to hide in secret.However, instead of removing his pursuers, Pyo-wol, on the contrary, dragged them all into a location which he knew best.\u2018He\u2019s really going to do it. He intends to go out fighting until the end in an environment he is most familiar with.\u2019The more he thought about the assassin, the more frightened he became.Having a high-ranking martial art was not the problem.Those who were simply strong in martial arts were widespread in Jianghu.\u00a0If you look at the Qingcheng sect right now, there will be dozens of masters who can overwhelm Pyo-wol. But none of them were as insistent and patient as Pyo-wol.Qing Ming thought that there might be more victims than he expected.\u2018I have to catch him. If I catch him, my reputation in the Qingcheng sect will rise up even more.\u2019He strengthened his resolve.\u00a0His nickname as Sword-Crazed Blood Wolf, [\uac80\ud608\ub791(\u5263\u8840\u72fc)] was not for nothing.Pyo-wol might be mad, but he was crazy too. And in terms of madness, he was second to none.\u201cAll of you, follow closely behind me from now on. We will move in pairs. You should also always check each other\u2019s positions. If we show even a small gap, he will dig in without mercy.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cUnderstood!\u201dThe disciples of the Qingcheng sect\u00a0 responded with a firm expression.Their faces were full of tension.In terms of numbers and martial skills, they were at an advantage, but the pitch-black space that did not receive a single point of light from the outside weakened their minds.\u00a0Qing Ming also knew that. But he had no way around it.\u00a0This is because humans instinctively feel fear of unknown spaces or existence that cannot be seen with the naked eye.\u2018No matter how much we have to sacrifice, we have no choice but to catch the assassin as much as possible.\u2019It was when Qing Ming was determined and moved cautiously.Chunkyung!Suddenly, a fine metal sound resounded from beneath his feet.The complexion of Qing Ming changed completely.\u201cIt\u2019s a trap! Everyone, dodge!\u201dPupupuk!At that moment, arrows came pouring from both sides of the wall.\u201cKuargh!\u201d\u201cShit!\u201dThe warriors of the Qingcheng sect unsheathed their swords and tore through the darkness as they tried to block the onslaught of arrows.As the martial artists of the prestigious Qingcheng sect, they deflected most of the arrows that poured down like rain. Only a few soldiers were seriously wounded in the process, but fortunately no one was killed.But they were not relieved.The arrow attack was only the beginning.Gigiging!The sound of an engine moving echoed ominously and various traps were activated.\u201cEveryone watch out!\u201dQing Ming swung his sword and shouted.\u00a0But he didn\u2019t know.\u00a0These traps were only just the beginning.This hellish institution, which the children had challenged and bled for seven years, was being activated yet again by Pyo-wol.Hope everyone had fun reading this chapter! \u2661Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 35": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 35Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMu Jeong-jin walked forward with a frown on his forehead.Originally, he was supposed to be with his disciples, but he chose to be separated and moved alone.\u2018Isn\u2019t this strange? It\u2019s highly unlikely that the assassins would build such a huge facility underground just to assassinate Gunsang.\u2019Intuitively, it didn\u2019t make sense.It was true that the image of Gunsang was widely recognized in Jianghu, but his reputation was still limited to Sichuan Province.The sects such as Shaolin Temple, Mount Hua Sect, and Wudang Sect had better martial artists than Woo Gunsang. They already have an outstanding reputation, and there was a great possibility that they would be leading figures in the future.Of course, there was also a great possibility that Woo Gunsang would grow into a leading figure in Sichuan, but his reputation was weaker than that of the disciples of the other three sects. No matter how much he thought about it, making this place just to kill Woo Gunsang made him look more special.\u2018It is highly likely that the assassins discovered and utilized this facility that someone made.\u2019A group capable of creating such a huge facility must have had tremendous forces and power.No matter how urgent the situation they were in, he had to know who made this place.Because it was related to the dignity of the Qingcheng sect.\u00a0If the power that created this place still exists in Sichuan, it was clear that they would end up being a great threat to the Qingcheng sect.\u00a0That was the reason Mu Jeong-jin moved alone.Mu Jeong-jin discovered a large iron door.He looked around with his torch, opened the lock and then went inside.The place he found was the dwelling place of the instructors of the Blood Shadow Group.\u00a0The dwellings of the instructors were the same as they were when they left.Like the children, the instructors\u00a0 suffered from the long hours in the underground cave. They didn\u2019t want to take the objects associated with the underground cave to the surface. So they left most of their stuff behind.Mu Jeong-jin looked into the rooms of the instructors one by one. But most of it just contains useless stuff. Still, without a sign of displeasure, Mu Jeong-jin meticulously searched all the rooms.He searched all the rooms like that, and he came to the last room.\u00a0It was the residence of Lim Sayeol.While searching for Lim Sayeol\u2019s residence, Mu Jeong-jin found a secret compartment. It was the place where Lim Sayeol hid his important documents.Mu Jeong-jin used his torch and read the documents one by one.\u201cT-These bastards!\u201dMu Jeong-jin, who was reading the document in his hands, burst out in anger.[Privy only to the Blood Shadow Group Captain.\u00a0Requesting the assassination of Woo Gunsang.\u00a0Duration: Seven years.Reward: 500,000 gold.Condition: Leave no traces related to the Blood Shadow Group.]It was a note that someone commissioned for the Blood Shadow Group.\u00a0\u201cHow dare\u2014!\u201dFor only 500,000 gold, the Qingcheng sect lost its bright future.Even if there was a bit of a difficulty, it did not change as much as the fact that Woo Gunsang was like a lamp that would light up the Qingcheng sect\u201cEuaa!\u201dThe warrior Mu Jeong-jin, with his hair rising, blew the wall in front of him with his great intense aura.Quarreung!A thick wall collapsed in his powerful roar, which was loaded with all his internal energy.Mu Jeong-jin frowned.It was because he did not know that the wall was going to collapse due to his aura that was caused by his anger.He led his torch through the crumbling wall.Sssssss!At that moment, a small noise reached Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s ears.Mu Jeong-jin carefully pointed his torch in the direction of the soun. The moment he confirmed the reality of the noise, Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s body stiffened.\u201cWhat?\u201dHe widened his eyes in disbelief.There was a large pit where Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s gaze was directed, and there were countless snakes entangled in it.The sight of large and small snakes wriggling in large pools was terrifying enough to make him nauseous.It was the first time in his life that he had seen such a sight, so he was unable to take any action for a moment.\u00a0\u201cC\u2026Crazy!\u201dHe came to his senses after a while.The snakes woke up, wriggling and weeping as if they felt the presence of Mu Jeong-jin. .One or two would hardly be audible, but when a huge number of snakes hissed, the sound was greatly amplified making it even more terrifying.The snakes had been hibernating for a long time, but were woken up by the sound of Mu Jeong-jin breaking the wall with his aura.\u00a0Some large snakes used each other to crawl out of the pits. However, it was not likely that they would get out immediately, so Mu Jeong-jin looked inside with confidence.In the middle of the room was a small table. There was a high pile of dust on the table.A yellow booklet lying on the table was revealed when Mu Jeong-jin reached the table.\u00a0The moment he checked the letters on the booklet, Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s eyes shook.\u00a0\u201cNine\u2026 Demon Style (\u4e5d\u9b54\u6d41)1?\u201dIt was now a forgotten name.The young martial artists of today did not even know that such a name existed. Even among the elderly warriors, only a few knew of the Nine Demon Style.\u00a0The Nine Demon Style disappeared a long time ago.There were two great wars that decided the fate of Jianghu within hundreds of years.The War of the Demons and Heaven (\u9b54\u5929\u5927\u6226) and the Battle of the Blood Heaven (\u8840\u5929\u5927\u6226).The War of the Demons and Heaven took place only a few decades ago, while the Battle of the Blood Heaven happened much earlier than that.\u00a0And the enemies of both battles were those of who continued the name of Magyo (\u9b54\u6559) or the demon sect.2\u00a0Although it is now a forgotten name in people\u2019s memory, the name Magyo was once synonymous with fear.There were Thirteen Tribes of the demon sect besides the Bonsan-Ilmaek [\ubcf8\uc0b0\uc77c\ub9e5(\u672c\u5c71\u4e00\u8108)], and the Nine Demon School was one of those thirteen tribes.\u00a0\u00a0The Thirteen Tribes were feared because they possessed a force comparable to that of the main sects. However, many of them were either destroyed during the Battle of the Blood Heaven or absorbed by the gods3\u00a0and disappeared from the world.The Nine Demon School was one of those sects.Mu Jeong-jin did not know what happened to them, but their names have not been mentioned once since the Battle of the Blood Heavens.The reason Mu Jeong-jin knew about the Nine Demon School was because the history books that were kept in the library of the Qingcheng sect contained detailed information about the situation of that time.In the booklet, it was written that the Nine Demon School was an unpredictable and bizarre sect.Just like the name Nine Demon School, there were nine different demon powers within the sect, and they dealt with bizarre techniques and demon practices rather than traditional martial arts.\u201cIs this the secret base or stronghold of the Nine Demon School?\u201dIf it was the base of the Nine Demon School, a tribe of the demon sect, and not anything else, then everything makes sense.\u00a0\u201cThen did the assassins accidentally find and use this empty space hat the Nine Demon School left?\u201dMu Jeong-jin read the booklet.The booklet describes the process of studying various poisons and an unknown monster.The content of the book was so vast that it was impossible to understand all of it with just one glance.Still, one thing was certain.The fact that Nine Demon School was especially obsessed with snakes.The snakes wriggling in the pit were laboriously collected from all over the world by the Nine Demon School to study them. However, when Nine Demon School left this place, it was clear that they had no choice but to abandon it.\u00a0\u201cNine Demon School\u2014 I might have to check it out as soon as I get back to the main sect.\u201dMu Jeong-jin placed the booklet in his arms and left.Now that he found out the identity of the underground cave, he had to go back in catching the assassin.* * *The faces of the Emei sect\u2019s disciples, as they walked holding on to their torches, were full of tension.Even the thick darkness did not completely hide their fears.It was the first time since they were born that they were placed in a darkness so thick. They never imagined that they would be able to step into such a vast dark space. It was an unknown space that they had never even imagined.So they had to be more careful by taking one step at a time.\u201cCome on, can\u2019t you move?\u201dIf it wasn\u2019t for Jeonghwa, who was following them with a ferocious voice from behind, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to even move like this.Jeonghwa encouraged the younger disciples.Her face was filled with an anxious light.A sense of crisis filled her mind that all of their secrets would be revealed if the assassin was not found and eliminated faster than the Qingcheng sect.\u00a0She was thinking of killing Pyo-wol.\u00a0In the midst of her thoughts, the Emei disciples increased the speed of their search. But the underground cave was more extensive than they could have imagined.How could such a large space exist underground?\u00a0Besides, it was incredibly dark.Without a torch, they could not even tell what was in front of them.No matter how elite the disciples of the Emei sect was, their power was inevitably dispersed as they searched such a wide area.However, since the Emei disciples were so concentrated on the search, they did not even realize that fact. Aiming for that moment while hiding in the dark, a red-eyed assassin began to move.Pyo-wol was reclining in a hollow above the wall of the underground cave.\u00a0From where he sat, the movements of the Emei warriors were clearly visible. They were chasing his trail noisily as they moved with their torches to and fro.They were trying to capture Pyo-wol, but their movement was actually being exposed.Pyo-wol\u2019s first target of assassination was the warrior at the forefront.He was a martial artist named Gong-un4, a second generation disciple of the Emei sect.\u00a0Gong-un was a martial artist who came in when the Guhwasata, the Abbess of Nine Calamities5, started accepting male students. He showed talent enough to break through the walls of Geumnam6, and since he was also tenacious, he was moderated by Guhwasata.\u00a0The reason why Gong-un took the lead was to show his presence by using this opportunity. Despite the fact that the wall preventing men from joining the sect was broken, discrimination still existed between the male and female disciples.\u2018If I make a substantial contribution this time, they will pass on the vision of Emei to me\u2026\u2019At that moment, the thoughts of Gong-un were suddenly cut off.Even his eyes that had been burning with ambition lost focus.The dagger, which silently cut through Gong-un\u2019s cervical vertebrae, stopped his breathing at once.There was no screaming, no commotion.Pyo-wol came with darkness and took his life in an instant.\u201cOh!\u201d\u201cJunior brother Gong-un!\u201dBy the time the warriors who followed Gong-un noticed what happened, Pyo-wol had already come close to them.Pyo-wol, who approached at a frightening speed without leaving a trace, snapped their necks in an instant.Pyo-wol injected his internal energy into the Cheonjamsa thread and pulled it with all his might.Tududuk!The warrior\u2019s heads that separated from their neck floated before falling on the floor.Darkness obscured the terrible scenery.\u00a0Pyo-wol, who killed three Emei disciples in an instant, hid himself in the dark again.\u201cGong-un has been killed by the assassin!\u201d\u201cEveryone, watch your surroundings!\u201dA commotion broke out among the warriors of the Emei sect, who belatedly noticed Gong-un\u2019s death.The chaos was a golden opportunity for Pyo-Wol.He mingled silently among the Emei disciples.Although his outfit was a little different, it was not a problem because the darkness covered it. There was an opponent right next to them, but the disciples of the Emei sect remained unaware of that fact.They would not have imagined that Pyo-wol would dare to blend proudly among them. However, Pyo-wol\u2019s audacity exceeded their imagination.The Emei disciples could only see ahead by relying on torches, but it was different for Pyo-wol. Even in the dark, he could see like it was noon.The difference decided their life and death.\u00a0Puuc!Pyo-wol wrapped his forearm around the neck of the warrior who was right next to him. The warrior who was startled by the sudden tightening of his breath, grabbed the sword in reverse and tried to stab it toward the back. But before the sword could hit him, Pyo-wol already twisted the man\u2019s neck.Touduk!The man\u2019s breath was cut off with an eerie sound of his bone fracturing.\u00a0Pyo-wol was relentless.He mingled among the Emei disciples and assassinated them to his heart\u2019s content.In an instant, more than 20 Emei sect\u2019s disciples lost their lives to Pyo-wol.Jeonghwa, who recognized the severity of the situation late, shouted.\u201cAll of you, gather together! He\u2019s hiding among us!\u201dThe Emei disciples hurriedly gathered around Jeonghwa.Pyo-wol followed them to the end and took two more by the throat.\u201cKouck!\u201d\u201cGreuk!\u201dThe Emei sect\u2019s disciples put on a fearful expression at the sight of the warriors who fell with foam on their mouths. A tremendous fear came crashing down like a tidal wave and engulfed their hearts.\u201cKuagh! I can\u2019t\u2026\u201d\u201cH\u2013How could this happen?!\u201dThe faces of the Emei warriors were all white.\u2018This is not good.\u2019Yong Seol-ran said as she looked at the faces of the disciples.Despite Jeonghwa\u2019s encouragement, the disciples\u2019 morale was already running low.As she had expected, this was the domain of Pyo-wol.\u00a0He was using everything here to hunt the disciples of Emei to his heart\u2019s content.\u2018If it goes on like this, there will definitely be more victims.\u2019Yong Seol-ran\u2019s talent was real. Her martial arts had already reached a level comparable to that of the famous masters of Sichuan. Considering her age, it was an astonishing achievement.But even with that kind of ability, she couldn\u2019t detect Pyo-wol.\u00a0Pyo-wol was darkness itself.His ability to use darkness and chaos was unparalleled, which no one dared to imitate.He infiltrated the Emei disciples, fostering division and a sense of crisis. And because of that, the Emei warriors lost their reason in fear and went back and forth.Jeonghwa tried to sort out the chaos, but it was in vain. She was already losing control of the disciples.In Yong Seol-ran\u2019s eyes, it looked like a sinking ship.\u2018If we keep going like this, we\u2019ll end up getting stuck. We have to join forces with the warriors of the Qingcheng sect at least once.\u2019She hurriedly looked around. However, the place where they went, none of the disciples of the Qingcheng sect could be seen.That was then.Poeng!Suddenly, a firecracker went off in the middle of the Emei disciples.As sparks splattered in all directions along with the explosion, the Eneu disciples were startled and scattered all over the place.\u201cOh no! Gather everyone!\u201dJeonghwa shouted loudly, but to no avail.Her voice is not heard by the disciples of Emei, who were lost in their confusion and fear.\u201cEveryone gather around the mansion!\u201dYong Seol-ran also shouted until\u00a0 her throat was about to burst. But her cry was to no avail.At that moment, Yong Seol-ran\u2019s eyes saw a dark shadow seeping through the Emei disciples.Ciit!\u201cKeuk!\u201dSomeone\u2019s screams continued to rip through the darkness.This chapter was so difficult to translate and edit~~ there\u2019s a lot of names used. Hopefully the translation still makes sense\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, we finally got some information about the Nine Demon Sect~ we\u2019re definitely ahead of the manhwa now (manhwa is ch25 as of the time i\u2019ve finished this chapter) *cheers*\u00a0After all that long grind of translating chapters\u2026 I\u2019m so happy (\uff89\u25d5\u30ee\u25d5)\uff89*:\uff65\uff9f\u2727Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Pyo-wol did not reveal himself, and moved using the darkness and chaos as his shield.When the firecrackers he stole from someone else were set off, the Emei sect\u2019s disciples could not come to their senses any more.They said that they would quickly come to their senses and rectify the situation, but in Pyo-wol\u2019s eyes, they were full of openings.\u00a0Pyo-wol did not miss the opening they provided. He never stayed in one place for too long. He was constantly on the move, looking for the next target.\u00a0He took advantage of everything that was available.\u00a0He would sometimes kill his opponents with his bare hands, while sometimes he would kill them with a weapon he had recently taken away.\u00a0However, not all of the disciples of the Emei sect remained helpless.\u201cDie!\u201d\u201cYou bastard assassin! If I die, I\u2019ll take you along with me!\u201dAs they lost many of their companions in an instant, the disciples of Emei crazily wielded their swords. They swung their swords wildly as if they were injected with something.Pyo-wol was not dull enough to be hit by a sword swung blindly. However, as he moved more vigorously in trying to avoid their swords, his stamina was rapidly consumed.\u2018Huff! Heuh!\u2019\u00a0His heart was beating violently as if it was about to explode.Pyo-wol suppressed the harsh breathing that was about to leak out of his mouth and looked at Jeonghwa.He didn\u2019t think that he could kill all of the Emei disciples anyway. From the beginning, his targets were only the leaders of the Emei which included Jeonghwa.His method of confusing and dispersing the Emei disciples was only his pre-work.Pyo-wol slowly moved forward.Like a cat, he completely killed the sound of his footsteps, and erased his presence.\u00a0As he thoroughly assimilated with the darkness, he carefully approached Jeonghwa.Jeonghwa\u2019s entire body was on alert, but she still failed to notice Pyo-wol\u2019s approach.Pyo-wol did not know exactly what position Jeonghwa held in the Emei sect. However, seeing that she was in charge of all the Emei warriors who came here, he soon realized that she was a very important figure.If he can kill her, the Emei sect\u2019s Guhwasata will also take a major hit.It was a pity that Guhwasata herself did not come, but he had to be satisfied with this for now.\u2018I must finish it at once.\u2019The longer the time he would take, the more disadvantageous it was for Pyo-wol.\u00a0He was taking advantage of the favorable environmental conditions to gain an upper hand, but he did not know how fast the situation would change if the warriors of the Qingcheng sect would join the fight.So before that happens, he had to quickly kill Jeonghwa.Pyo-wol concentrated his qi on the tips of his ten fingers.He could have used a weapon that had fallen on the floor, but the one he was most familiar with was his bare hands.Ciiiit!Pyo-wol unleashed his Seventy-Two Sword Wave towards Jeonghwa.He unknowingly unfolded the martial arts he was most familiar with.\u201cNo\u2014\u201dJust before Pyo-wol\u2019s attack hit her body, Jeonghwa suddenly deflected the attack with lightning speed. Her instincts as a martial artist warned her of the incoming danger.She was one of the Emei sect\u2019s great disciples. With her martial arts and senses that she had trained for decades, she sensed Pyo-wol\u2019s surprised attacks.\u00a0Chhuhaha!Her chowry1, which was injected with internal energy, was a terrifying weapon.Jeonghwa unleashed the Emei sect\u2019s arcane sword attack with vigor. Even the darkness seemed to tremble with fear due to its immense power.\u00a0But Pyo-wol was indifferent.He knew that if he chose to fight at this moment, he would inevitably get hurt.But he wasn\u2019t afraid to get hurt.In this hellish place, he was wounded hundreds of times, and he would recover again and again.No matter how many times the pain he felt was repeated, his heart became stronger than steel.He won\u2019t die.\u00a0No matter how badly injured he is, he will persevere and stand up again. So he had no fear of getting hurt.If he could kill an enemy even if he got hurt, the person who would end up having the last laugh would be Pyo-wol.Cwahak!Jeonghwa\u2019s chowry passed by and grazed his left shoulder.\u00a0His flesh was ripped off, and the muscles were torn like rags. Blood poured down like a waterfall, and a dizzying pain took over his mind, but he didn\u2019t stop attacking.Pyo-wol exploded everything he had with a single breath.\u201cARGH!\u201dJeonghwa dropped her weapon and let out a desperate scream. She covered her right eye with her hand and shuddered. Dark red blood gushed out on both of her right eye and fingers.The attack of Pyo-wol stole Jeonghwa\u2019s right eye.Pyo-wol suddenly looked at his left side.\u00a0A long sword was stuck in his side.It was the longsword of Yong Seol-ran.\u00a0At the moment when Pyo-wol attacked Jeonghwa, Yong Seol-ran unleashes the Emei sect\u2019s arcane swordsmanship, Thirteen Jade Swords [\uc625\ud5c8\uc2ed\uc0bc\uac81(\u7389\u865a\u5341\u4e09\u5251)] to save her.Pyo-wol, who was focused on attacking Jeonghwa, was unable to stop the Yong Seol-ran\u2019s attack.If only he hadn\u2019t received Yong Seol-ran\u2019s attack on his side, he would have been able to kill Jeonghwa with this single move.Yong Seol-ran grabbed a torch that had fallen nearby and blocked the way in front of Jeonghwa. Pyo-wol pulled out the sword that was stuck in his side and opened his mouth.\u201cYou managed to block my attack.\u201d\u201cI was lucky.\u201d\u201cLuck?\u201d\u201cI just attacked by instinct.\u201d\u201cYou have great instincts.\u201d\u201cI hear that often.\u201dThe tone of the two people was so casual that if people whom they didn\u2019t know saw them, they would have mistakenly thought it was a conversation between lovers.\u00a0But the reality was different.Pyo-wol needed time to stop his bleeding, and Yong Seol-ran, who had lost her weapon, needed time to regain her composure.Yong Seol-ran looked at Pyo-wol\u2019s wounds and said,\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just surrender?\u201d\u201cSurrender?\u201d\u201cWhat else can you do with a body like that? It would be better for you to surrender.\u201d\u201cIf I surrender, will you spare me?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201d\u201cSee? You\u2019re not going to spare me. If you wanted me alive in the first place, you wouldn\u2019t have done something like this, would you?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cKilling me.\u201dAt Pyo-wol\u2019s words who seemed to know everything, Yong Seol-ran was at a loss for words.\u2018Was there someone like this?\u2019It is said that dragons appear in Jianghu, but she really did not know that there would be such a person in a group of assassins.\u00a0\u201cHow much do you know?\u201d\u201cThat the Abbess of the Nine Calamities was behind all of this.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous how you\u2019re amazing. Someone like you could have become my Master\u2019s disciple.\u201d\u201cEven if I\u2019m reborn, I would refuse. I don\u2019t have the heart to join a sect like that. I\u2019d rather bite my tongue and die than to become a disciple of that devil.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like Master nor do I want this to happen either.\u201d\u201cBut you\u2019re still following her?\u201d\u201cShe saved my life. So I\u2019ve been blessed.\u201d\u201cIs that the only reason you follow her?\u201d\u201cYou killed Junior Brother Woo. Him and I were supposed to get married.\u201d\u201cSo I killed your fiance? I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cI have no regrets, because I didn\u2019t want to marry him either.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re no different from the woman named Guhwasata. Doing the same things!\u201d\u201cIf I don\u2019t, then I will not be able to survive in this tough world.\u201dTo some extent, Yong Seol-ran regained her calm expression. It was the same with Pyo-wol.\u00a0He roughly stopped the bleeding from the wound on his side. If he moved violently, his wounds would open again, but he can withstand an attack at least once.At that time, Jeonghwa said,\u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about? Come on, subdue that assassin!\u201dJeonghwa, who lost one eye to Pyo-wol, lost all of her reason.\u00a0At Jeonghwa\u2019s cry, Yong Seol-ran did her stance. A powerful energy flowed from Yong Seol-ran\u2019s whole body.Pyo-wol felt her strength through his skin.So far, he has gained the upper hand because he had used the darkness and familiar terrain as his weapon. But he wasn\u2019t sure if he would be able to defeat Yong Seol-ran if he confronted her head-on.Knowing this fact, Yong Seol-ran also intentionally released a powerful energy to press Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol quietly took a step back.Because of the momentum that was expressed, he did not find it necessary for him to face the opponent head-on.\u00a0Pyo-wol was an assassin.Assassins do not hesitate to do anything cowardly to kill their enemies.It would be foolish for him not to use the most effective means of killing the enemy.A torch can temporarily illuminate the surroundings, but it cannot dispel the darkness forever.Pyo-wol was hiding himself in the dark and was planning to take advantage of the opening. But his wish did not come true.Shuack!It was because suddenly a sharp sword flew through the darkness.\u201cKuagh!\u201dHe had no time to dodge.\u00a0Pyo-wol stopped the sword by concentrating all his energy on his weaker right arm as quickly as possible.Bang!With a deafening sound, Pyo-wol\u2019s body bounced back.Pyo-wol flew as nearly a dozen meters or so before crashing into the wall.His appearance looked truly miserable.His right arm, which had blocked the sword, was torn to the extent that his bones were exposed. He also had large wounds on his chest and right side.No matter how tenacious Pyo-wol was, it was impossible for him to move with such wounds.\u201cHeuff!\u201dPyo-wol took in a rough breath.Both of his eyes were stained red, its blood vessels bursting all over. Blood was also pouring down from his nose and mouth.The pain came over as if his whole body had been crushed by a boulder.\u00a0Pyo-wol did not scream, and waited for the\u00a0 pain to subside.Sueuk!At that moment, someone appeared from the darkness.The owner of the pair of eyes that glowed in the dark was Mu Jeong-jin.In Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s hand was the sword from which he had just thrown before. His sword was a weapon that only the elders of the Qingcheng sect could wield.The person who was most perplexed by the appearance of Mu Jeong-jin was Jeonghwa. Even while she was distracted from the pain of losing one of her eyes, Jeonghwa thought that Pyo-wol should not be left this way.\u00a0\u201cDie!\u201dShe grabbed her sword and ran towards Pyo-wol.\u00a0Her intention was to kill Pyo-wol immediately to shut his mouth. However, her attack was blocked by Mu Jeong-jin.\u201cBack off.\u201dAs Mu Jeong-jin lightly swung his hand, a powerful wind rose and pushed Jeonghwa away.Jeonghwa vomited blood and shouted.\u201cMu Jeong-jin, kill him! If you keep him alive, you don\u2019t know what kind of tricks he will use.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s something I can take care of.\u201dIn response to Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s cold reply, Jeonghwa tightly closed the rest of her eyes.Mu Jeong-jin approached Pyo-wol, who was sitting while leaning against the wall. He then knelt down on one knee.He looked into Pyo-wol\u2019s eyes and opened his mouth,\u201cSo it\u2019s you. The one who killed Woo Gunsang\u2026 Why? Why did you kill him?\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m\u2026 an assassin\u201d\u201cEven an assassin must have the ability to judge right from wrong.\u201d\u201cK\u2026Keugh! I was brought here at the age of fourteen. I was raised as an assassin before I even had the mindset to judge right from wrong.\u201d\u201cYou mean you didn\u2019t have a choice?\u201d\u201cHngg! There\u2019s no way someone who was not raised as an assassin would have something like that.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t see any room for rebirth.\u201dMu Jeong-jin was taken aback by Pyo-wol\u2019s eyes which were full of poison.He had met countless warriors and taught a lot of them martial arts, but no one had eyes as venomous as Pyo-wol.His eyes could never have been taught.\u00a0It must have been born naturally.\u00a0\u2018If I had taught him myself, he would have been a great man.\u2019He suddenly felt that it was a shame.How could someone with such a talent be raised as an assassin and soon be eliminated? But he had no desire to spare him. Pyo-wol assassinated Woo Gunsang. He also wounded and killed numerous warriors in the process of escaping from the inescapable net.\u00a0It was difficult even for Mu Jeong-jin to cover his sin.Suddenly, Mu Jeong-jin pulled out a letter from his arms.Pyo-wol recognized at a glance that the letter in his hand was a request he found at Lim Sayeol\u2019s residence.\u201cSo you found it.\u201d\u201cYou knew it right away. Then you must know who the client is.\u201d\u201cI have a guess.\u201d\u201cWho is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the same person you\u2019re suspecting.\u201dPyo-wol looked at the disciples of the Emei sect while revealing his white teeth. Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s gaze also turned to the Emei sect.\u00a0The moment she saw Pyo-wol\u2019s smile, Jeonghwa felt goosebumps all over her body.\u2018All these circumstances were induced by that demon\u2014!\u2019It was by no means a coincidence that, among the numerous sects that made up the inescapable net, only the Qingcheng and the Emei sect entered the underground cave.\u00a0That\u2019s what Pyo-wol had intended.He created division by tying the sect who requested the assassination and the sect targeted for the assassination into one place.\u201cHAHAHAHA\u2014!\u201dPyo-wol\u2019s mad laugh echoed in the dark basement.Hope you enjoyed reading!

    "Chapter 37": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 37Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cKeuk!\u201dPyo-wol stopped his laughter and vomited blood.The blood reddened his chest and stomach.\u00a0 The excruciating pain continued on, but Pyo-wol didn\u2019t care.He was in a very good mood now.It was because he threw the spark of strife between the Qingcheng and the Emei sect. It didn\u2019t matter whether the two sects would fight a blood-splattering war or suturing awkwardly.No matter what the outcome would be, it will be impossible to go back to their amiable relationship.This was his revenge for the Emei sect, who mocked his fate.He didn\u2019t feel sorry for the Qingcheng sect.\u00a0There are no innocent people among those living in Jianghu. Everyone would commit a sin in one way or another as they live by dominating over others.The Qingcheng sect also could not get out of that category.So he didn\u2019t regret it. He didn\u2019t even feel guilty.\u201cKeke!\u201dAt the sight of Pyo-wol, who was grinning even in his horribly ruined state, Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s eyebrows rose to the sky.\u2018We must immediately get rid of him.\u2019He felt afraid of Pyo-Wol.Simply speaking, assassins such as Pyo-wol did not possess any fear. More than his martial arts, Pyo-wol had a quality that stimulated people\u2019s fear.It was his first time he had ever seen a person with such features.\u00a0That was then.\u201cMaster, are you okay?\u201d\u201cSabaek!\u201dThe disciples of the Qingcheng sect, including Qing Ming, ran towards Mu Jeong-jin.They were full of wounds as they broke through the trap triggered by Pyo-wol. Anger appeared on the face of Mu Jeong-jinin as he looked at them. Because some of the disciples were not present.\u00a0\u201cWhy are there missing children?\u201d\u201cI apologize. We fell into his trap and some lost their lives.\u201dMu Jeong-jin closed his eyes tightly at Qing Ming\u2019s answer.After a while, when he opened his eyes again, pressure seemed to overflow. It felt so frightening that Jeonghwa and the rest of the Emei disciples retreated back at once.Mu Jeong-jin, who looked at Pyo-wol for a moment, grabbed his ankle. And began to drag him somewhere.\u201cA comfortable death for you is a luxury. You must suffer and die in pain worse than hell to atone for those who have been killed by you.\u201dHis cold voice pierced Pyo-wol\u2019s ears.\u2018Atonement? Are you kidding me? Then who will compensate me for the seven years that ruined my life?\u2019Pyo-wol snorted.He had his back collapsed, broken and torn on the floor. Still, the reason why he didn\u2019t feel any pain was because he had already suffered a greater wound.Mu Jeong-jin dragged Pyo-wol and headed to the residence of the instructors. To be precise, it was the abode of Lim Sayeol.\u00a0The disciples of the Qingcheng sect hurriedly followed Mu Jeong-jin.Yong Seol-ran said to Jeonghwa.\u201cAren\u2019t we supposed to follow him too?\u201d\u201cAre you crazy? Do you know what kind of anger we\u2019re going to receive if we follow them? We need to get out of here.\u201d\u201cThe situation will not be resolved if we run away like this. It might be better to be honest and ask for a conversation.\u201d\u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about? Do you know what we have done? All we can do is fight to the end. Do you have any evidence other than the letter?\u201d\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\u201cMaster will be the one to decide. Don\u2019t talk anymore. Let\u2019s go!\u201dJeonghwa led the disciples and climbed the rope.Yong Seol-ran was the last to go. She looked in the direction where Pyo-wol disappeared.\u201cHuu\u2026\u201dShe soon climbed up the rope leaving only a small sigh.Mu Jeong-jin said to Qing Ming.\u00a0\u201cYou too, take your disciples and go out.\u201d\u201cPardon? But\u2026\u201d\u201cIf those bastards cut the rope that leads to the outside, we\u2019re going to end up isolated here. So hurry up and stop that situation from happening.\u201d\u201cUnderstood!\u201dQing Ming answered with a firm expression on his face.He went straight up to the ground with some of his disciples.The place where Mu Jeong-jin took Pyo-wol was the newly discovered space beyond the collapsed wall of Lim Sayeol\u2019s residence.Sssss!As they crossed the wall, the loud hissing of the snakes resounded.\u201cHiick!\u201d\u201cEueum!\u201dThe faces of the disciples of the Qingcheng sect turned white when they saw the snake pit using their torch.The sight of countless snakes wriggling together was so terrible that it was terrifying to even dream of seeing them.Only then did the disciples of the Qingcheng sect realize why Mu Jeong-jin had brought Pyo-wol here.Mu Jeong-jin was thinking of throwing Pyo-wol into that snake pit.He was literally trying to throw him as a prey to the snakes.Mu Jeong-jin asked,\u201cYou still have no intention of atonement?\u201dPyo-wol\u2019s lips twisted and went up.\u00a0He didn\u2019t even have the energy to open his mouth anymore. But the meaning behind his smile was clear.It was a sneer.\u00a0Mu Jeong-jin shook his head.\u201cYou are an unworthy human. You do not deserve to breathe in a world like ours. Atone here and die a painful death.\u201dHuiic!Mu Jeong-jin picked up Pyo-wol\u2019s body and then threw him into the snake pit.\u00a0\u201cAmitabha!1\u201c\u201cHeuk!\u201dThe warriors of the Qingcheng sect could not be proud of their actions so they turn their headsThe figure of Pyo-wol, who fell into the snake pit, disappeared in an instant. It was because numerous snakes had already managed to wrap around him and stirred his body.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dMu Jeong-jin said to his disciples without looking back.\u201cYes!\u201dThe warriors of the Qingcheng sect hurriedly followed him. Because they didn\u2019t want to see the snakes eating a person who was still breathing.Sssssshisk!The sound of snakes enjoying its supper behind them made the situation even more blood-curdling.\u00a0Mu Jeong-jin told them,\u201cAs soon as we get out, close this terrible place. No one should be able to enter.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dMu Jeong-jin\u2019s eyes shone brilliantly at the response of the warriors.\u2018Emei sect! I will never forgive you!\u2019The only evidence he has was Pyo-wol\u2019s reply and the letter that he had in his arms, but Mu Jeong-jin did not doubt anymore the fact that the Emei sect was behind all these incidents.Pyo-wol, who had already become prey for snakes, was no longer his concern.His target was the Emei sect.\u00a0\u201cEmei sect! You will soon know that the sword of Qingcheng sect has not rusted.\u201d* * *Pyo-wol felt that his body was sinking to the abyss.\u00a0In fact, his body was slowly sinking beneath the snake pit. Snakes wrapped around him and crawled.Pyo-wol was fed up with that terrible feeling, even in the midst of being confused.The snakes had awakened from their long hibernation and were very hungry. If Pyo-wol had been smaller, he would have devoured it right away. But he was too big to swallow in one bite.When the snakes couldn\u2019t swallow Pyo-wol, some hasty bastards dug their fangs. As their poison was injected in his body, Pyo-wol felt excruciating pain.His already dying body trembled in response to the poison. There were different types of poison given the different kinds of snakes.Different types of poison mixed and reacted within Pyo-wol\u2019s body.Pyo-wol\u2019s eyes widened at the pain beyond his imagination. The pain was so excruciating that he thought that he would rather die than endure like this.If\u00a0 it were a normal person, they would have died the moment they were bitten by a snake. However, Pyo-wol was resistant to the snake\u2019s venom.\u00a0Although he felt pain, he could not die easily.Even in his horrible state, his body tried its best to resist the poison.Rather, his dying body had awakened as the poison entered the body. The poison attacked Pyo-wol\u2019s body and stimulated the natural rebirth.\u00a0\u201cKukhyuk!\u201dPyo-wol opened his mouth slightly and let out a rough breath. Then the snakes around him shook.\u00a0The other snakes put their fangs on Pyo-wol\u2019s body. Again, Pyo-wol felt indescribable pain as if his body was melting from the newly injected poison.Pyo-wol\u2019s body trembled. Regardless of his will, his body continued to react.\u00a0It was a vicious cycle. He would have snakes stuck their fangs on his body while his body would react in different ways.\u00a0Poison gradually accumulated in Pyo-wol\u2019s body as numerous poisons attacked the inside of his\u00a0 body.His spirit grew clearer as the pain felt more vivid.Pyo-wol became unable to both live or die. He just suffered from the countless snake bites.\u00a0His face and body became swollen from snake venom.\u00a0He wanted to scream as much as he could. But the moment he opened his mouth wide, the fear that a snake might crawl into his throat made his teeth clench.Pyo-wol thought desperately.\u2018If I go on like this, I will die.\u2019Even though his body was resistant to poison, he was still human.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t stand the poison being injected indiscriminately.His body had already reached its limit.If a snake bites anymore than this, it is clear that his body will be out of balance and he would end up dying.So before that happens, he had to figure out a way.At that moment, the first thing that popped into his head was the first snake that bit him in the underground room. Back then he couldn\u2019t even guess where the snake came from, but it seemed like it probably escaped from this pit.\u00a0The snake was perfectly adapted to the darkness.\u2018I have to adapt like that snake.\u2019Similarly with how the small snake adapted to the darkness in order to live, Pyo-wol had to adapt to the snake den in order survive.\u2018I have to think like a snake, breathe like a snake, and move like a snake. That\u2019s the only way to survive.\u2019Quak!Again, he felt pain in his ankle. Another snake has bitten his ankle.There was no area where his body was not full of snake-bite marks. Wherever the snake bites the area becomes undoubtedly swollen.Having a painful area was actually fine. The most unbearable part for him was the itchy area. Some poisons caused an unbearable itching layer.It would have been better if he could scratch it with his hand, but it was clear that moving his body even a little bit would irritate the snakes, so he had no choice but to grit his teeth and put up with it.Pyo-wol held his breath.Simply weakening his breathing was not enough.He had to breathe like a snake.Pyo-wol tried to feel the snake\u2019s breath with his eyes closed.It would have been normally impossible.\u00a0But now it soon became possible.\u00a0Because Pyo-wol\u2019s spirit was clearer than ever.His body, which was seriously injured and suffered from various snake venoms, was unable to move like a stone statue, so his senses were more sensitive than usual.Sreuk! Srreuk!Countless snakes wrapped around him, and a terrifying sound echoed.Some of them choked Pyo-wol\u2019s neck, while the smaller ones tried to enter the body through Pyo-wol\u2019s nostrils and ears.\u00a0Fortunately, such an incident did not happen, but for Pyo-wol, it was a horrifying xperience.\u201cSsss\u2013!\u201dA voice resembling a snake came out of Pyo-wol\u2019s mouth.As he forcibly tried to breathe like a snake, a similar sound came out.In an instant, the snakes covering Pyo-wol\u2019s body responded to his voice.\u00a0He looked like he was thinking of something.Not just one or two, but tens of thousands of snakes having its head raised up close would be terrifying.\u00a0\u00a0But Pyo-wol didn\u2019t even think of that.It was because he had his eyes closed and his whole mind was focused on breathing like a snake.In the meantime, he had his body bitten several more times.Now that his body has reached its limit, his breathing became even more ragged. Still, Pyo-wol desperately tried to imitate the snake\u2019s breath.He didn\u2019t know how much time had passed.At some point, Pyo-wol\u2019s breathing stabilized.\u00a0Ssss!The sound of a snake\u2019s breath was coming out of his mouth. It wasn\u2019t perfect, but it was able to somehow imitate a snake\u2019s breath.\u00a0Snakes breathe differently from humans.Whereas humans breathe\u00a0 by inhaling and exhaling all of the air in their lungs, snakes always leave about half of the air in the lungs.By leaving extra air in the lungs, they were able to hold their breath for much longer.Pyo-wol also found out about that fact while imitating the breath of a snake.The more he knew about the snake, the more amazing he found the creature was. There were no body parts that were useless to snakes. The reptile was specialized in survival.\u00a0He thought it was exactly the same as him.Strong patience and stamina, as well as tenacity and venom were the snake\u2019s characteristics that were similar to him.\u00a0His fear of snakes disappeared. Even as he was buried in an insurmountable number of snakes, he did not feel any discomfort.Pyo-wol soon fell asleep comfortably for the first time buried in a number of snakes.Sssssssee you in the next chapter~ sss~Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 38": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 38Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayPyo-wol opened his eyes.He was still stuck in a snake\u2019s den. His body was still swollen. This was because the snake venom that entered the body has not yet been eliminated.\u00a0His body still couldn\u2019t move, but there was one piece of good news.After imitating the breathing of a snake, he was no longer bitten by a snake. The snakes seemed to recognize Pyo-wol as one of them.\u00a0After getting used to the snake\u2019s breath to some extent, Pyo-wol began to have other ideas.\u00a0\u2018Isn\u2019t it possible to combine the snake\u2019s breath with the Thunder-Splitting technique?\u2019It was a crazy idea, but he didn\u2019t think it was impossible.\u00a0The essence of the Thunder-Splitting Cultivation technique was accelerating his speed of the thoughts. Thus, the increase in the speed of the thinking naturally increases the speed of the body\u2019s reaction.He thought that if he could combine it with the snake\u2019s breathing, he might discover a new breakthrough.Those were Pyo-wol\u2019s thoughts.In anyways, all he could do right now was think because his body was not capable of moving.\u00a0Thinking, analyzing, reasoning, and calculating were all he could do.Pyo-wol thought about how to effectively merge the snake\u2019s breathing using the Thunder-Splitting method.\u00a0He fell asleep thinking about it, and when he opened his eyes, he repeated his routine of brainstorming. And from a certain moment on, Pyo-wol began to combine the snake\u2019s breathing little by little with the Thunder-Splitting technique.\u00a0With his mind, he was using the Thunder-Splitting method, and with his body, he breathed like a snake.In the beginning, the two breathing methods started to mix little by little.\u00a0It is as if ink was dropped into a basin full of clear water.Pyo-wol did not know how dangerous his actions were now. He didn\u2019t even know that it was an attempt that went against the general principles of Martial Arts.If he had great knowledge about martial arts, he would never have attempted this.If the man who had abandoned him here could see what he was doing, he would have been immediately furious thinking that Pyo-wol was crazy.\u00a0To a great extent, what Pyo-wol was doing now completely goes against common sense.But paradoxically, he was able to try new things because he was not bound by stereotypes. Pyo-wol had no preconceived notions about martial arts.There was no stereotype that stops him from doing something because of a particular reason.\u00a0He thought freely and tried everything he could imagine.Pyo-wol forgot the passage of time and immersed himself in the breath he created.At some point, Pyo-wol\u2019s pain began to subside little by little. The poison that used to accumulate in his body was now either neutralized or melted into his blood.\u00a0The only reason why that became possible was because of his newly created cultivation method.\u00a0It was the so-called Sub-Thunder Snake Cultivation Method [\ubd84\ub8b0\uc0ac\ud63c\uc2ec\ubc95(\u5206\u96f7\u86c7\u9b42\u5fc3\u6cd5)].This new cultivation technique, created by Pyo-wol in the snake pit, was effective in controlling the poison that had penetrated into the body.The more he used the Sub-Thunder Snake Cultivation Method, the more snake venom naturally fused with his internal energy.\u00a0Now snake venom was no longer his object of fear.When the snake venom was absorbed, the swelling in Pyo-wol\u2019s body had noticeably been reduced. Finally, when all of the poison was gone, his physical body was able to move.Pyo-wol moved his finger.When the strange movement was felt, the snakes went mad.Snakes nearby immediately bit Pyo-wol with their fangs. Pyo-wol did not resist and accepted the venom of the snakes. Then, when he felt hungry, he reached out and grabbed a snake nearby.Pyo-wol caught a small snake that bit the back of his hand. He then took a bite of the snake\u2019s head with his mouth.Wagzak!The snake\u2019s head shattered in Pyo-wol\u2019s mouth.The flesh he chewed came with a fishy smell.He didn\u2019t know how long it had been since he had last tasted food. He didn\u2019t think it was disgusting. He even felt ecstatic about the flesh that he ate after such a long time.The snakes here also ate each other to survive until now. The strong have endured for a long time by eating the weak.\u00a0 It was not a sin to eat other creatures here.The same was true for Pyo-wol.\u00a0He survived by imitating snakes, so there was no reason to feel guilty about eating them.\u00a0Living with snakes, the snake\u2019s survival instinct naturally melted into Pyo-wol.As Pyo-wol lived in a snake pit, whenever he became hungry, he would eat the snakes. Although his body recovered to some extent and he was able to climb out of the snake pit on his own, Pyo-wol chose not to.\u00a0Because there was so much more to be gained here than trying to go out.An animal such as the snake made Pyo-wol experienced many things.Their bodies and developed senses, which were focused on survival, were something Pyo-wol still have to learn.So Pyo-wol continued to willingly live with snakes to observe their behavior.\u00a0As a result, he noticed that the eyesight of snakes was different from that of other animals. The vertically split eyes of the snakes could see into areas that humans and other animals could not see.One of the things Pyo-wol discovered was that snakes were excellent at detecting body temperature given their particularly sensitive senses. Rather than relying on their eyes to see the shape of the living creature, they used it to sense and distinguish a creature\u2019s body temperature.1\u00a0Pyo-wol came to know this fact while learning the Sub-Thunder Snake Cultivation method.\u00a0If he looked at an object while using the Sub-Thunder Snake Cultivation method, he could see its temperature with his eyes. At first he didn\u2019t know what the change in his perspective meant, but as time went on, he realized that it was how a snake\u2019s vision works.\u00a0Seeing the world through the eyes of a snake was different.\u00a0Pyo-wol has already adapted to the darkness to the point that it was like daytime even in places without a single light.The expansion of his field of vision also came with\u00a0 the expansion of his senses.Pyo-wol opened his senses as he assimilated with the snakes.He didn\u2019t know how much time had passed.It was almost impossible to capture the flow of time in a place where not a single point of light could enter. Because of that, Pyo-wol didn\u2019t even know how long he had been trapped in the snake pit.He could only guess that he had spent quite a long time with the snakes because his hair and beard had grown quite long.\u201cHuuu\u2013!\u201dPyo-wol slowly exhaled and moved his body. The snakes went mad. However, Pyo-wol continued to writhe around without hesitation.His physical condition was perfect.He delivered power to his arms and legs. The swelling of his body completely disappeared, and all of the wounds that were once so severe were now healed.Pyo-wol slowly moved his body. His movements were awkward at first, but later on, he naturally swam among the snakes.His movement without using his arms and legs was similar to a snake moving in the water.Although Pyo-wol was moving around, the snakes did not attack Pyo-wol. He was being mistaken for a fellow snake.After swimming for a while, Pyo-wol stuck his head out of the snake pit.\u201cHaa\u2026!\u201dPyo-wol took a moment to breathe in some fresh air.In the serpent pit he had never once been able to breathe freely. This was because the air was thin. In order to live, the use of the Sub-Thunder Snake Cultivation method must not be stopped even for a moment.Tuck!Pyo-wol got out of the snake pit using both of his arms as support. It\u2019s been a long time since he had stood with his feet on the ground, so he felt strange.He had a feeling that his legs were definitely alright, but at the same time it wasn\u2019t. But the foreign feeling quickly disappeared.Pyo-wol looked around for a moment.Lim Sayeol\u2019s residence, seen through the wall, had not changed at all from when he was thrown into a snake pit.Pyo-wol came out of the hole where the snake pit was. The underground cave, with all of the torches extinguished, was darkness itself.The underground cave was eerily quiet that he couldn\u2019t even hear insects crawling, let alone sensing a presence.\u00a0Neither the warriors of the Qingcheng sect nor the disciples of the Emei sect could be seen.Everyone had already left this place.\u201cI am alone again.\u201dPyo-wol\u2019s voice echoed in the darkness.Even though he was alone, Pyo-wol didn\u2019t feel lonely. Maybe he had already forgotten the feeling of loneliness.Pyo-wol sat on a large rock and looked at the space above him. The rope he used to come down here disappeared and was nowhere to be seen. Perhaps the warriors of those two sects took it.Even though the only exit to the outside was blocked, Pyo-wol was not disheartened.\u00a0Because he already expected that to happen.\u00a0As long as the rope was gone, it was impossible to go outside.At least with his current martial arts level.\u00a0\u201cI have to grow stronger.\u201dWhen he bumped into Mu Jeong-jin, he became certain.\u00a0How insignificant his martial arts level is.Even if he tried a sneak attack, there was nothing that could kill Mu Jeong-jin. The odds of killing him were extremely slim.He had to be stronger.That even if he cannot carry out a sneak attack, he would be able to face his opponents confidently.\u00a0He already knew how to become stronger.\u201cI have to utilize and develop everything I have.\u201dHe was now the owner of this space that was completely cut off from the outside. He didn\u2019t expect to eat delicious food, but by eating snakes, he can satisfy his hunger.That was enough.After thinking about something for a moment, Pyo-wol began to move.The place he was headed to was where he had previously attacked and fought the Emei disciples. The Emei sect was unable to retrieve the bodies of the disciples because they had to flee. So the bodies of the Emei disciples still remained in various places.He didn\u2019t know how much time had passed, but the only thing that remained from the corpses of the Emei disciples were clothes and bones.The worms ate up all the flesh.Pyo-wol searched their arms without aversion. After searching dozens of bodies, Pyo-wol was able to find a booklet.The booklet was the Pyoseol Cheonunjang [\ud45c\uc124\ucc9c\uc6b4\uc7a5(\u8133\u96ea\u7a7f\u96f2\u638c)]2.It was a copy, not an original.The Pyoseol Cheonunjang was the strong fighting method that the Emei sect was proud of.The person who carried the booklet in his arms was a martial artist named Gong-un, who lost his life to Pyo-Wol. Gong-un was a\u00a0 second generation disciple of the Emei sect, and was allowed to learn Pyoseol Cheonunjan so he carried a copy.He originally would have left the manuscript at his sect, but he had carried it with him because he left so hastily.Gong-un did not think that he would not be able to return to his sect until he died.Pyoseol Cheonunjang was one of the highest ranked martial arts that the Emei faction was proud of. It was a technique not leaked to the public.\u201cI\u2019m lucky.\u201dPyo-wol mumbled.\u00a0Although he was not formally taught, he learned the Seventy-Two Sword Wave of the Qingcheng sect. And this time, he also obtained the Emei sect\u2019s Pyoseol Cheonunjang. There is also the assassination methods he learned from the Blood Shadow Group.\u00a0So he wasn\u2019t entirely without basics.\u00a0Pyo-wol was going to see the end up here.The end of the Seventy-Two Sword Waves and the end of the Pyoseol Cheonunjang.And he will combine the essence of the two martial arts into his own method of assassination.Maybe it was impossible. That only a true master of martial arts can fuse three martial arts of completely different natures into one.But he didn\u2019t even think it would be impossible at all.He had already created a new kind of technique called the Sub-Thunder Snake method.\u00a0It was also because of luck, but it would have been impossible if it wasn\u2019t supported by Pyo-wol\u2019s talent and effort in the first place.Pyo-wol sat down and began to examine the contents of the secret technique. He forgot the passage of time as he dug deep into the martial arts.* * *Something came into the darkness.A beast with wings too large for its small body.\u00a0It was a bat hanging from the ceiling. It looked around for a moment.It was a pitch-black space with no light coming in. It can grasp a space that the human eye could never see using its other senses.The bat pricked its ears for a moment and then started flying in one direction.Neither the protruding stalactites nor the bulging roof of the pavilion could hinder the bat.The bat flew into the dark hallway, avoiding all the obstacles.Without even paying attention to the rooms on the left and right of the hallway, the bat headed towards the deepest room.Entering through the cracks in the broken door, a strange noise was heard.Susuc!Any sane person who hears the sound would not be able to help but feel frightened.\u00a0But bats were not human.\u00a0The bat knew that the sound it heard was the characteristic breathing sound of a snake moving.The bat looked down as it flew through the rectangular underground space. There was a large snake pit where the bat\u2019s gaze was directed.Numerous snakes were wriggling together.Snakes were good food for bats.In particular, small ones like snakes were a staple food for bats. Those tiny snakes were intermingled among the big ones.The bat descended into the snake pit without making a sound.It was planning to snatch just one snake.When the bat was almost approaching the snake pit.\u00a0A white hand suddenly protruded from among the snakes.\u00a0But the bat remained completely unaware of that fact.The bat\u2019s nerves were so concentrated on the snake, and most of all, the movement of the hand was so stealthy that the bat could not detect it.Bats were particularly sensitive to changes in the air.It used sound to identify the terrain, so even if there was a slight change in the air, the bat should have been able to immediately sense and avoid the hand.\u00a0But at that moment, it didn\u2019t feel any change in the environment at all.The pure white hand grabbed the bat without making a sound.It was only then that the bat realized the existence of the hand and began to rage, but to no avail.\u00a0The pure white hand held the bat tightly and did not let go.In an instant, the owner of the hand appeared through numerous snakes.The snakes swayed desperately away from the owner of the hands, as if they were confronted with a dreadful being.A man with long hair down to his waist and a beard covering his chest.He was naked, not a single thread in sight.His naked body was beautiful, as if he had no muscles at all.\u00a0 If a snake would take off all its skin and transform, a person would wonder if it would look like this.\u00a0The man with the pair of red eyes glowing in the dark was Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol muttered as he watched the bat flapping in his hand.\u201cIs the road to the outside open?\u201dOMGGG~ is Pyo-wol about to go the outside world?!?! I\u2019m so hyped!! I also can\u2019t wait to translate the next chapter and know what\u2019s going to happen next (\u0e51\u02c3\u1d17\u02c2)\ufeedPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He found it mysterious.\u00a0The bat flapped its wings, trying to get out of Pyo-wol\u2019s hand. However, no matter how much the bat shook, it could not escape Pyo-wol\u2019s hand.As if trapped in an invisible, intangible membrane, the bat floundered on Pyo-wol\u2019s palm.Pyo-wol gently reached out his other hand and caressed the bat. Then it trembled as if a bat had met its natural enemy.\u201cSsss!\u201dPyo-wol made a strange sound as he touched the bat as if it were his child. The bat was frozen like ice and couldn\u2019t move.Pyo-wol smirked lightly.His white teeth were revealed in the dark.His appearance was surprisingly friendly.He had no idea how many years he had been here.He could only guess at the fact that he had stayed there for quite some time with his long hair and shaggy beard.A normal person would have gone crazy staying in a place like this for a few days. However, Pyo-wol managed to keep his mind intact.No, maybe he became crazy, but he was just not aware of it.It didn\u2019t matter either way.All he had done in the meantime was to practice the Sub-Thunder Snake method, assimilate himself with snakes, and learn martial arts.His life, which repeated every day like a treadmill, was too monotonous for a sane person to handle.As the Sub-Thunder Snake method reached a certain level, it was now difficult to distinguish whether Pyo-wol was a snake or a human being.He breathed like a snake and looked at the world through the eyes of a snake. And from a certain moment, he reached the point of breathing through his skin like some of the snakes.This wasn\u2019t what he intended.\u00a0The changes just happened naturally, like breathing.After learning the snake\u2019s habits, he made no sound even while walking. No matter how narrow the opening, if his head was inserted in, his entire body could pass through.The function of the Sub-Thunder Snake method was not limited to that.The acceleration and expansion of thinking became possible. He can think more broadly and make decisions faster. And his body can immediately respond given those brain changes.He has had reflexes and physical abilities that transcend ordinary humans.But Pyo-wol was still not satisfied with that level.So he practiced the Seventy-Two Swords Waves while operating the Sub-Thunder Snake method.Before returning to the underground cave for the second time, his understanding of the Seventy-Two Sword Waves was only about one fourth. However, his understanding increased by breaking through the inescapable net.\u00a0The Seventy-Two Sword Wave was a skill made in the early days of the Qingcheng sect. Although it was pushed aside by the other skills created after that, it was never a martial art that can be taken lightly.Pyo-wol insistently studied the Seventy-Two Sword Wave.As he learned and endured, his understanding deepened.When the Seventy-Two Sword Wave reached a certain level, he studied how to activate it with his bare hands. He broke down the technique and tried to rebuild it again to fit his bare hands.His attempts have failed dozens of times. However, Pyo-wol did not become frustrated nor did he despair.If he failed, he just thought of going back from the beginning.\u00a0All the useless parts were cut off, leaving only the core parts. He then reassembled it to his own taste.Thanks to the Sub-Thunder Snake method, his intellectual powers increased dramatically, making Pyo-wol\u2019s plan possible.\u00a0Pyo-wol learned the Seventy-Two Sword Waves to the extreme. After mastering all of the Seventy-Two Swords, he then spent time comprehending the Emei sect\u2019s Pyoseol Cheonunjang.Although both sects were in the same province which was Sichuan, there was a big difference in the nature of the Qingcheng sect and the Emei sect\u2019s martial arts.The two sects differed from their origins.The Qingcheng sect had its origins in Taoism, while the Emei school had its origins in Buddhism. There would obviously be a stark difference from their cultivation methods to their philosophy.It was a very dangerous thing to learn two completely different martial arts simultaneously. However, Pyo-wol did not care and still studied the Pyo-seol Cheonunjang.The characteristic feature of Pyoseol Cheonunjang was that it was like snow blowing in the wind. It is a martial art who shares the same box with the shaman\u2019s myeonjang [\uba74\uc7a5(\u7dbf\u638c)].The technique was much more difficult to learn than other strong martial arts. This was because, without proper operation and power control, the person cannot exert its actual power.\u00a0For that reason, even Gong-un, who had obtained a copy of Pyoseol Cheonunjang, did not dare to learn it easily.In order to exert the full power of the Pyoseol Cheonunjang, it is necessary to have a great understanding of the philosophy of the Emei sect.\u00a0Without understanding the context and meaning behind the text, it would be near impossible to bring out its original power.\u00a0Pyo-wol, unaware of that fact, learned Pyo-seol Cheonunjang based on the Sub-Thunder Snake method.Of course, he couldn\u2019t draw out the skill\u2019s actual power.His learning speed was also slow.Still, Pyo-wol did not give up.All he had left was time.There are only a few things that could be done in a place where there was no distinction between day and night.Even if he fails, he can always try again.There was no need to worry about unsuccessful attempts.Pyo-wol\u2019s body, which has adopted the snake\u2019s habits and characteristics, was tougher and more flexible than any other martial arts masters, so he can easily handle any shock.Just as he disassembled the Seventy-Two Sword Waves, Pyo-wol broke down the Pyoseol Cheonunjang into pieces and reassembled it to suit himself.In this way, Pyoseol Cheonunjang was recreated by Pyo-wol.But Pyo-wol was still not satisfied with that level.So he attempted to\u00a0combine\u00a0the Seventy-Two Sword Waves and the essence of Pyo Seol Cheonunjang into an entirely new method.Naturally, his attempts were unsuccessful.There were times when he would struggle with qi deviation, and there were times when his heart would burst due to the regurgitation of the internal organs.\u00a0He had fallen into a moribund state and visited the threshold of death dozens of times.And each time, Pyo-wol would go back and visit the snake pit.He would regain his vitality and stamping by meditating among the snakes, and eating them.Every time he would overcome the crisis of death, he would shed his skin. With each layer of skin removed, his body grew tougher and stronger.Pyo-wol would constantly overcome death and become strong.Now the bat stopped flapping its wings. It sat quietly on Pyo-wol\u2019s palm and waited.\u00a0Pyo-wol had no intention of killing the bat.This was because bats were the evidence that a passage to the outside had been opened.This was the first time Pyo-wol had seen a bat in an underground cave. If the bat had really managed to come in from the outside, there must be a passage.\u201cGood!\u201dHe was thinking about going out now.Because he realized that further training was meaningless.Pyo-wol didn\u2019t know exactly how much time he spent.\u00a0However, he was confident that he would not be easily pushed back if faces the other martial artists of Jianghu.\u00a0\u00a0Pyo-wol took a step forward.Passing through the corridors where the instructor\u2019s live, he headed into a huge underground cave.\u00a0The buildings, which had been built in the underground cavity, could not withstand the passage of time and collapsed, leaving only ruins.Pyo-wol searched through the ruins.Moments later, a torn garment was in his hand.It was the clothes of the Emei disciples who died here. Pyo-wol had taken off the clothes of the male disciples and kept them here.It was only here in the underground that he could stay naked since he was alone. But he couldn\u2019t do that outside.Pyo-wol wore the clothes that looked most intact.It\u2019s been a while since he has worn clothes, so the feeling was unfamiliar. But he thought he\u2019d get used to it soon.Just like it has been so far.His preparation to leave was over.There was no excitement.His heart was so calm that it was strange.Maybe\u00a0 after being with the snakes for a long time, his heart had also become as cold as a snake.\u00a0Pyo-wol spread his palms wide. Still, the bat didn\u2019t even try to fly. Pyo-wol thought that the bat should be set free.\u00a0Later on, the bat flapped its wings vigorously.The bat fluttered in place for a moment, then began to soar vigorously into the air.Pyo-wol looked carefully at the direction the bat was heading.The bat soared towards the ceiling, changed direction and then headed towards a particular wall. And after a while, it disappeared.\u00a0Pyo-wol moved in the direction the bat disappeared.It was a wall that was located a dozen or so high above the ground. When he touched the wall, he felt a small crack.The space was small enough for Pyo-wol\u2019s head to fit in.\u00a0Inside the wall was a pile of broken stones. It seems that the wall has recently weakened and collapsed.Pyo-wol brought his face near the crack.\u00a0He felt a cold wind. Air is coming in from the outside.\u201cHou\u2013eup!\u201dPyo-wol inhaled the fresh air coming in from the outside, deep in his lungs.There was nothing special about the air as it entered through the underground passage, but the feeling was different.Pyo-wol\u2019s heart was beating faster than usual just because the air had flown in from the outside, and not simply from the underground cavity.This crack was another uncharted space for Pyo-Wol.Little bats were small enough to crawl in there, but no one can guarantee if there was room for a person to pass through.If one would make a mistake, they could get stuck in the middle and be unable to continue or go back. No matter how good a person\u2019s martial arts were, any normal person couldn\u2019t help but feel fear.\u00a0But Pyo-wol was different.After living in harmony with the darkness and snakes for a long time, he could no longer feel the emotion called fear.Pyo-wol shoved his head into a small crack.It was only large enough to fit a single head, but miraculously, Pyo-wol\u2019s shoulders and body glided through the cramped space.Inside the crack, it was truly a dark place.\u00a0It was so dark that he couldn\u2019t even see his hand. However, Pyo-wol did not make a fearful expression and crawled forward without hesitation.The darkness was familiar to him.Others may fear it, but to him it felt as comfortable as a mother\u2019s womb.Pyo-wol has adapted to the darkness perfectly.\u00a0A darkness of this degree was still bright like broad daylight.Pyo-wol crawled non-stop.There were sharp pieces of stone and unidentified ores protruding here and there, but none of it did any harm to Pyo-wol\u2019s body.Pyo-wol moved like a snake, gliding gently.Srreuk!Only the rustling of his clothes echoed in the darkness.Pyo-wol so crawled in the dark without rest.It was impossible to guess where the end of the crack was.Sometimes he would go down, and at other times, he would pass through a near-vertical passage. However, Pyo-wol crawled and crawled without any sign of exhaustion.He didn\u2019t know how long he crawled.\u00a0A faint light was seen in the distance.In an instant, a turbulent expression appeared on Pyo-wol\u2019s face.No matter how cold his emotions were, his emotions were bound to stir in front of the light he had not seen for such a long time.He wanted to go to the place where the light was right away, but Pyo-wol stopped moving.His eyes were perfectly adapted to the darkness. If he goes out into the bright world in this state, his eyes will not be able to bear it and he will die or become blind.His heart was in a hurry, but he had to stop and rest so his eyes had to adjust to the light.\u00a0Pyo-wol crouched down and looked at the dim light in the distance. That alone felt like having his eyeball burst in pain.Pyo-wol quickly turned his head and looked at the other side. The pain subsided a little.Pyo-wol approached the entrance little by little every day. Inching closer to the light already made him feel a burning pain in his eyes and skin.It was as if thousands of needles were stabbing his whole body. However, Pyo-wol did not give up and adapted little by little to the light.It took him ten days to fully adapt to the light.\u00a0Then Pyo-wol went out.It was the cramped space between the large rocks where Pyo-wol had squeezed out.The gap between the rocks was so narrow that no one dared to imagine that it would lead deep underground.A raccoon or a weasel crawled through the crevice of the rock.Pyo-wol did not raise his head for a moment.Although he tried as much as possible to adapt to the light in the cave entrance, facing the sun directly would bring him a different kind of pain.He felt pain and thirst as if his whole body was burning.\u00a0This was why he needed to adapt as much as he could.\u00a0Pyo-wol did not avoid the pain.Later on, he looked straight up at the blazing sun.As time passed, the pain gradually subsided.As time passed, the pain gradually subsided.His reddened skin calmed down, and his tears slowly stopped. Later on, the redness completely disappeared.\u201cPhew\u2026\u201dPyo-wol sighed and turned his head to look around.He saw an unfamiliar landscape.He previously entered a vertical opening at the top of the mountain to enter the underground cave usually.\u00a0But now, the hole he exited from lead to the bottom of the mountain. Thanks to this, he was able to avoid the trouble of coming down the mountain.Pyo-wol looked at the top of the mountain for a moment and then moved on.He had no regrets.He wanted to get out of this damn place quickly.Pyo-wol walked without looking back.The smell of the forest tickled the tip of his nose. A gentle breeze blew past his body.It was a feeling he could never feel in the underground cave where everything including time seemed to have stopped.It felt like the sensations in his body were coming back to life.It was only now that he truly felt that he was alive.After walking for a while, a fairly large stream appeared. In the water, Pyo-wol looked at his face.A strange man was staring right back at him in the water. Long hair down to his waist and a beard covering his chest.\u00a0He expected his appearance to be something like this, but seeing it with own eyes, he still felt like it was someone else\u2019s face.Pyo-wol jumped straight into the water.He swam in the water, removing all the dirt.After brushing off all the unique underground smells from his body, he pulled out a small dagger from his waist.It was the only tool he had brought from the underground cave.\u00a0Pyo-wol looked at his own face reflected in the water and roughly cut his hair and beard.\u00a0His face was revealed.He had not seen the sun for a long time so his skin had turned white. It contrasted well with his dark hair and soft red eyes.\u00a0His features resembled a person full of decadence, close to royalty. He had a strange atmosphere and a beautiful face that seemed not to be a person in this world.Pyo-wol stood blankly for a long time and stared at his reflection on the surface of the water.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Indigenous people from Kang County were the predominant, but there were also many Han Chinese.Although the city was located in a remote place, there was a lot of rice and various specialty products, so merchants did not stop visiting throughout the year. Thanks to this, entertainment facilities such as inns and brothels were well established.\u201cHo-ho! Come here.\u201d\u201cHow about having a drink here today?\u201dThe courtesans lured passersby by sticking their upper body out the window.\u201cHeheh! Good!\u201d\u201cThese guys! Wash up and wait. This old man will come running to you after today\u2019s deal is over.\u201dMerchants who were not unfamiliar with this atmosphere looked at the courtesans with a sinister smile, and young men who were unfamiliar with the situation turned their heads away and fled.\u201cHo-ho-ho!\u201dThe high courtesans burst out laughing.\u00a0As darkness descended on the street, the atmosphere became even more lively. The courtesans lit up red lanterns and seduced customers by acting coquettish. However, because it was still early, there were not many customers coming to the brothels.Red Sky Pavilion\u00a02\u00a0was one of the largest and most splendid among the inns in Batang.\u00a0There were also many high-level courtesans. The origins of the courtesans also varied. There were women who came from Kang County or Han as well as women from Yunnan or Xijiang.\u00a0For this reason, people who\u2019s visiting Batang for the first time usually find and stay in the Red Sky Pavilion and unwound.Seolhyang\u00a03\u00a0 was the most popular courtesan in the Red Sky Pavilion..Her beautiful features and her snow-white skin was what attracted the people\u2019s attention. But the most impressive thing about her the most were her eyes.Seolhyang had eyes that were commonly called as three white eyes.4The white color surrounding the three sides of her eyes gave off a strange atmosphere.Many men fell in love with Seolhyang\u2019s unique atmosphere and visited her. However, it was almost impossible to sleep with her even if she kept a customer by her side throughout the drinking party.Because Seolhyang didn\u2019t allow it.No matter how wealthy the customer was, she would not allow access to her body if she did not like it. Still, many men were willing to pay a lot of money to join her.Seolhyang looked at the street with a bored expression.Red Sky Pavilion was still quiet, just like any other tower. But after a while, all the rooms will be full of guests.\u2018This is boring.\u2019Seolhyang yawned lightly.Even for today, she adorned herself beautifully and wore colorful clothes. The ornaments made by a famous craftsman hung all over her body like a fruit.She was a flower.And it was the duty of a flower to lure in butterflies and bees.Seolhyang looked out the window, exuding her happiness to the fullest.She saw people walking down the street.Batang natives do not come here. Most of the people in the streets were foreigners. Among them, those who boasted that they made a lot of money usually come to this place.Even those who casually passed through the street could not take their eyes off of Seolhyang whenever they managed to take a glimpse of her. Seolhyang did not blush even once, despite their gazes which were full of desire.She was used to this look.Most of the men who saw Seolhyang looked at her with eyes full of desire. Seolhyang thought that men were the same because she had been treated like that since childhood.If she shows even a little bit of her smile to indicate that she\u2019s fond of something, many would be willing to give her all of their fortune. In that way, there were already more than ten people who have been financially ruined.Seolhyang thought that men who she could put on her toes were not really great. However, as always, she thoroughly concealed her inner feelings and seduced every man she saw with a bright smile.Then, a strange sight entered Seolhyang\u2019s eyes.Among the many people walking down the street, one person clearly caught her eye.Most of the people walking on this street were wearing high-quality silk or fancy clothes, but he was wearing very shabby clothes.So he stood out even more.In a sense, it was something that was not often seen here. But what stood out more than his clothing was the man\u2019s appearance.\u201cAh!\u201dThe moment she saw him, a burst of laughter came out of her mouth without realizing it.A beautiful face with whiter skin than any woman and a decadent beauty. His deep, shadowed eyes were so beautiful that anyone who would see them, exclamations of admiration would burst out from them.Seolhyang lost her mind as she looked at the man\u2019s face.She had seen a lot of men before, but this was the first time she\u2019s seen a man like this.He couldn\u2019t take my eyes off him.It was the same with other courtesans.\u201cOh!\u201d\u201cHow can a man have a face like that\u2026\u201dThe prostitutes who were sticking out their faces through the window could not take their eyes off the man\u2019s face.That man had the power to catch the people\u2019s attention.In particular, the women looked at the man with a weak pulse.The man looked around with a curious expression as if it was his first time being to a place like this.\u00a0He then met Seolhyang\u2019s eyes.For a moment, Seolhyang found herself lightheaded.The man looked at Seolhyang half-heartedly with his bright red eyes. Seolhyang could not remove her gaze.Seolhyang unknowingly told the man.\u201cCome in here.\u201dA lot of men have visited so far, but this man was the first one to make her tell them to come in first.The man did not refuse and entered the Red Sky Pavilion.\u00a0Seolhyang hurriedly went down to the first floor to meet the man. There she saw a man coming into the Red Sky Pavilion.\u201cOh\u2013!\u201dThe man she saw up close was more beautiful.As if he had never been in the sun, his pure white skin was shining under the light of red lanterns.\u201cAbove\u2026!\u201d (\u201c\uc0c1\u2026\uacf5!)Seolhyang approached the man.In an instant, Seolhyang inhaled the strong body scent from the man. A strange scent was emanating from the man.The scent that seemed to shed people made Seolhyang unable to find reason.What made her mind dizzy more than anything else were his eyes that had a subtle tinge of red. Seolhyang was mesmerized by his eyes that seemed to sucked her in the more she stares at him.The man asked Seolhyang.\u201cThis is a brothel right?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right! Above!\u201dSeolhyang shook her head and replied. Unknowingly, she was treating the man with a humble attitude.\u201cCan I stay a few days even without any money?\u201d\u201cO-Of course\u2026.\u201dHad another guest here said they have no money, she would have looked at them with contempt. But when the man in front of her said that he doesn\u2019t have any money, there was no contempt, only regret.\u201cI\u2019ll take care of you, so don\u2019t worry about anything and come inside.\u201dSeolhyang pulled the man\u2019s hand.The man entered her residence as naturally as if he had entered his own house.* * *Geum Si-yeon, the owner of Red Sky Pavilion, looked at the Chongwan with a frown.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t we making a\u00a0 profit? Haven\u2019t our sales been below average for the past few days?\u201d\u201cThat is\u2026\u201dChongwang bowed his head with a troubled look..Geum Si-yeon said as she banged the table,\u201cWhy can\u2019t you tell me? What the hell is going on in the Red Sky Pavilion?\u201d\u201cSeolhyang hasn\u2019t worked for the past few days.\u201d\u201cSeolhyang? Why?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because she fell in love with a certain guy\u2014\u201d\u201cThe girl fell for a man? Are you joking with me?\u201dGeum Si-yeon knew what Seolhyang was like better than anyone. If I spilled a man, I spilled it, and I was never a basil character to a man. She couldn\u2019t easily believe the words of Chongwan that Seolhyang was obsessed with a man and stopped accepting clients.\u00a0As Geum Si-yeon got angry, Chongwan said with an unhappy expression,\u201cIt\u2019s true. She\u2019s been stuck in her room for three days and still hasn\u2019t come out.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll check it myself. Have the other kids ready.\u201dGeum Si-yeon got up.Her eyes were full of poison.The Red Sky Pavilion was a business she worked so hard for. Seolhyang was the best courtesan of her business. It was impossible to see such a commodity fall in love with a man and cause damage to the business.Dozens of men followed Geum Si-yeon.The men were warriors dispatched by Cheongok-gwan5\u00a0in Batang.Geum Si-yeon had a close relationship with Yu Jin-san, the ruler of Cheongok-gwan. Although she was already retired from the front line, Geum Si-yeon still boasted a decent beauty and education.\u00a0Because of that, Yu Jinsan, the most powerful member of the party, fell in love with her and sent warriors to look after her.Although they cannot be compared to the Two Factions (\u4e8c\u6d3e), the Three Gates (\u4e09\u9580), the Four Fangs (\u56db\u623f), and the Five Halls (\u4e94\u9928) that make up Sichuan Province, there were no military officers who dared to compete with the Cheongok-gwan in the vicinity of Batang.\u00a0When Geum Si-yeon appeared leading the men of Cheongok-gwan, all the courtesans and workers they encountered turned their heads and avoided them.Geum Si-yeon\u2019s power was so great that no one dared to stop her.The courtesans looked at Geum Si-yeon\u2019s back with bewildered expressions.\u201cWhy is Si-yeon unnie so angry?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because of Seolhyang.\u201d\u201cWhat did Seolhyang unnie do?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s been out of business for the past few days because she fell for a certain guy. With the best courtesan in the Red Sky Pavilion not selling her services, the damage is huge.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of man is he for the sassy Seolhyang unnie to make her stop doing her business and be locked up in her room?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know! But that man\u2019s skill is no joke. I mean why were they moaning until dawn?\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dThe young-looking courtesan widened her eyes. Her eyes were full of curiosity.If it were a man, it was the courtesans who got vigor. You can moan briefly during the intercourse to please a man, but it\u2019s impossible to do it all night.Unless you have sex overnight.\u201cEggmannina! He\u2019s a great man.\u201d\u201cHo-ho! I must have orphaned a lot of snakes. Very just\u2014\u201dGeum Si-yeon\u2019s expression was distorted by the chatter of the courtesans who were unable to grasp the atmosphere.\u2018These empty-headed bitches can\u2019t even understand the atmosphere\u2014 After being lenient on them for while, everyone became\u00a0 out of tune.\u2019\u2019Geum Si-yeon thought that as soon as she solved the problem of Seolhyang, she would also talk and discipline the other prostitutes.Geum Si-yeon and the warriors finally arrived in front of Seolhyang\u2019s room.Seolhyang\u2019s door was firmly shut.When Geum Si-yeon glared at it, the soldiers immediately forced the door open.Thud!As soon as the door opened, hot air rushed out.Geum Si-yeon frowned.Because he knows well what the heat coming out of the room means.Geum Si-yeon looked around the room.Red silk gold needles were scattered all over, and Seolhyang\u2019s pure white naked body was visible. She was lying on a man\u2019s lap, breathing heavily.Just by looking at it, she could fully guess what had just happened.Geum Si-yeon burst into anger.\u201cSeolhyang! What are you doing after closing your services?!\u201d\u201cSi-yeon unnie?\u201dThen Seolhyang turned her head and looked at Geum Si-yeon. Her eyes were dreamily opened and her face was full of redness.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2013?\u201d\u201cHoo!\u201dSeolhyang raised her upper body, covering her white naked body with a silk blanket.\u00a0Geum Si-yeon\u2019s gaze turned to the man.It was because she was curious about the face of the man who captured Seolhyang under his spell.\u00a0Even though Geum Si-yeon and warriors came in with the door open, the man sat and looked out the window, not even paying the slightest bit of attention to them.Although he hasn\u2019t turned his head yet to reveal his face, she felt a strange atmosphere coming from the man.His undressed, white upper body was smooth as if he had no muscles.The appearance of the scattered candles illuminating his smooth body made him look mysterious.For a moment, Geum Siyeon felt a sense of incongruity that could not be explained in words.There was something off about him.\u00a0The man did not match the atmosphere. Still, it was strangely mixed. The man\u2019s\u00a0 appearance stimulated Geum Si-yeon\u2019s instinct.Geum Si-yeon opened her mouth carefully.\u201cI want to see the face of the unauthorized guest.\u201dThe man turned his head at her voice.\u201cAh!\u201dAs soon as she saw the man\u2019s face, Siyeon Geum let out a soft gasp without realizing it.The man\u2019s face was too beautiful to be expressed in words.She had spent nearly thirty years as a courtesan. She had already met so many men and slept with them. But no other man could match the beautiful charm of the man in front of her.Especially his pair of eyes with a soft red color seemed to tickle even Geum Si-yeon\u2019s heart.At that moment, Geum Si-yeon seemed to understand why Seolhyang had fallen for the man.With such a man, it would be difficult for any woman to get out of his grasp easily.Since Geum Si-yeon has seen through everything with her matured age, she can keep her reason against the man, but it seemed that it would be impossible for young womento get out of the charm of the man.\u00a0\u2018Where did such a person\u2014\u2019Geum Siyeon instinctively took a step back.Because she smelled a dangerous smell from the man.It was like seeing a big snake. She had goosebumps all over her body and her\u00a0 hair stood up straight.As Geum Si-yeon\u2019s face turned white, the warriors supported her and said,\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cMaybe the man used some sort of trickery?\u201dGeum Si-yeon could not easily answer the questions of the soldiers and only shook her head. But warriors thought that Geum Si-yeon had been enchanted, and looked at Pyo-wol.\u201cBring him out.\u201dThank you for reading!

Unlike the unknown man who does not have any muscle, they were proud of their lean muscular bodies.\u201cBring that bastard out!\u201d\u201cAsshole!\u201dThe warriors were angry for no reason. From the moment they laid their eyes on the unknown man, strangely, they couldn\u2019t control their anger.They thought they should drag the man out and teach him a lesson.\u201cIt would be better to just follow along.\u201dThe warriors took hold of the man\u2019s arms and exerted force. However, no matter how much strength was applied, the man did not move.\u201cHik!\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dVeins popped out of the foreheads of the warriors. They exerted enough strength to drag him out, but they still couldn\u2019t drag the man out.\u00a0Then they realized that something was wrong.\u201cHmm\u2013?\u201d\u201cWhat? You bastard!\u201dAt that moment, the man opened his mouth for the first time,\u201cLet go of my hand.\u201dThe man\u2019s voice was very soft. But it sounded strangely clear. The moment they heard his voice, the soldiers felt goosebumps rising up their spines. Their whole body stiffened, and their hair stood up.Their instinct whispered that they had to stop here. However, their pride did not allow them to retreat like this.\u201cWhat bullshit are you talking about?\u201d\u201cCome on, get up!\u201dThe warriors raised their internal energy and tried to bring down the man in front of them. But the man\u2019s body still didn\u2019t budge.\u00a0His body obviously looked slender, but it felt as if his body was made of rock. At that moment, the soldiers felt a sense of crisis and tried to take their hands off the man.That was the moment.\u201cKeuk!\u201d\u201cKurkhyuk!\u201dThe warriors who had put their hands on the man\u2019s body suddenly collapsed with a loud scream. Their eyes rolled and white foam came out of their mouth.\u00a0Seeing the scene, the rest of the warriors raised their swords and shouted.\u201cWhat did you do?!\u201d\u201cDo you want to die?!\u201dAt that moment, the man raised his body.\u00a0A red silk robe landed on Seolhyang\u2019s naked body who was not wearing a single thread.\u201cSanggong!\u201d (\uc0c1\uacf5)Seolhyang wrapped her arms around the man\u2019s body from behind. Seolhyang hugged the man from behind and did not know that he would fall. It was not normal for anyone to see.If she had proper judgment, Seolhyang should have taken the side of the warriors. However, Seolhyang was attached to the man\u2019s back pretending not to see the warriors.\u00a0The man opened his mouth for the first time.\u201cI\u2019m leaving in three days. I\u2019ll be quiet before I go, so don\u2019t bother me.\u201dIt was a voice that was low and quiet, like the whisper of a snake.The warriors and Geum Si-yeon felt as if a large snake was watching over them.Their bodies trembled, and cold sweat broke out on their palms. It was the first time in their life that they felt this way.The man who looked down on them was Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol wasn\u2019t in a good mood right now.Because his rest was interrupted.For the past three days, Pyo-wol has been coveting Seolhyang in her room.He spent seven years being raised as an assassin and another seven years in an underground cave after being attacked by Mu Jeong-jin.A total of fourteen years had been spent in an empty underground cave.It was only a short time when he saw the light\u2014 when he assassinated Woo Gunsang, and when he ran away from the inescapable net. Most of the rest of his time was spent in the dark.The average person would have gone crazy without being able to endure it for a few days. After spending such a long time in darkness, Pyo-wol was very hungry.Pyo-wol himself did not know, but from his whole body, a body odor that made women feel hot was emanating from his body.The more intense his feelings, the stronger the body odor, and the woman fell into a frenzy.It was at that moment when Seolhyang brought him into the room. He found out that he had been imprisoned in an underground cave for seven more years.He was now twenty-eight years old. But the thought that he had spent half of my life in vain in pitch black darkness intensified his emotions.Seolhyang was caught at that time.Pyo-wol has been coveting her for the past three days without thinking. It was kind of like a reward for his strong mentality.\u00a0Pyo-wol had undying energy and sexual desire.Seolhyang was completely tamed by Pyo-wol.Now, she couldn\u2019t even think of any other man other than Pyo-wol.As Pyo-wol was about to close the door, an old warrior called out.\u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about?! What have you done to my comrades? Can\u2019t you go and restore them back to their normal state?\u201d\u201cAfter a day or three, they will recover. So don\u2019t bother and step back.\u201dSeven years in the underground cavity was a time spent in exploring assassination techniques.\u00a0During that long time, Pyo-wol studied only how to kill opponents. Among them was how to kill people without leaving any traces. The technique used on the warriors who were in pain with foam coming out of their mouth was a weak application of one of the techniques.If Pyo-wol had wanted to, they would have stopped breathing without even realizing that they were dying.\u201cDo you know who you\u2019re facing?\u00a0 Do you think you\u2019ll be okay after you injure the warriors of Cheongok-gwan in the Padang?\u201d\u2018\u201cCheongok-gwan?\u201dPyo-wol tilted his head.Because it was the first time he heard the name.All of the famous sects of Sichuan Province had participated in the inescapable net aimed at him. But he had never heard the name Cheongok-gwan anywhere.If so, there is a high possibility that the Cheongok-gwan, which the warrior in front of him was proud of, is actually just a mere sect or group.\u00a0Even if they were a great place, it didn\u2019t matter.He is not what he used to be.He was not just a mere assassin, a young boy who had to run away because he lacked the strength. Even back then, he fought for his life against the Qingcheng and the Emei sect.\u00a0At Pyo-wol\u2019s attitude as if he was ignoring the name Cheongok-gwan, the old warrior cried out,\u00a0\u201cDo you dare ignore the Cheongok-gwan?! I don\u2019t know what kind of tricks you used, but it won\u2019t work for me!\u201dThe old warriorswung his sword and ran towards him.Other warriors followed.The young red light in Pyo-wol\u2019s eyes deepened.He suddenly stretched out his palms and thrust them forward.Geum Si-yeon\u2019s face was filled with suspicion. It was because she did not understand what the hell Pyo-wol was choosing to do at this dangerous moment.\u2018He\u2019s not thinking of facing the warriors of the Cheongok-gwan, does he?\u2019That was then.\u201cHeuk!\u201d\u201cKeukek!\u201dThe warriors who were running towards Pyo-wol like a lie, grabbed their chests and fell. They threw themselves on the floor, clutching their chests with painful expressions. Some have their faces already turned black.\u201cHiick!\u201dGeum Si-yeon covered her mouth with both hands at the unbelievable sight.\u2018A master!\u2019If he defeated the opponent without touching them, it was clear that he had reached a level where he could release his energy.\u00a0There were not many masters in Sichuan who reached that level.Although Geum Si-yeon didn\u2019t know anything about martial arts, she had a wealth of insight.As far as she knew, even Yu Jin-san, the head of Cheongok-gwan, had not reached that level.\u2018Is there such a master in Sichuan?\u2019Not to mention, Pyo-wol was remarkably handsome. It was hard to believe that a man who possesses such an appearance would be still unknown.Geum Si-yeon\u2019s eyes shook anxiously.Because she knows from experience that there would be constant storms brewing around a person who suddenly stands out like this.\u201cKukeuk!\u201d\u201cSa, save me!\u201dThe warriors were toppling on the floor in agony.The veins on their faces looked like it was about to burst.Geum Si-yeon quickly realized that she had to do something.\u201cSa, Sang\u2026gong! Please forgive them at this point.\u201d\u201cForgive?\u201d\u201cYes! These people were rude without knowing that a precious person had arrived. I\u2019ll take care of everything during your stay, so how about forgiving them at this point?\u201dGeum Siyeon got down on her knees and begged.\u00a0One of her greatest strengths was her keen eyes.Until she came here, she thought she needed to take care of Seolhyang and Pyowol, but as soon as she realized that Pyo-wol was not someone she could handle, she immediately changed her attitude.What he did was not something anyone could do.Pyo-wol looked at Geum Si-yeon inquiringly.At that moment, a hand as white touched Pyo-wol\u2019s chest.When he turned his head, Seolhyang was looking at him with a sultry gaze.\u201cPlease forgive Si-yeon unnie for me. Si-yeon unnie is not a bad person.\u201dEven if it wasn\u2019t because of Seolhyang\u2019s request, he had no intention of causing any more trouble.Because he still wanted to rest more.One day he will end this life, but not for the time being.Pyo-wol gently waved his hand. Then the warriors lying on the floor widened their eyes and exhaled a big breath. Because the pain suddenly disappeared.Pyo-wol looked at them and said,\u201cThree days. That\u2019s all I\u2019m asking. I hope that all of you would not dare disturb me. Tell that to your leader.\u201dThe warriors looked at Pyo-wol with terrified expressions, but did not say anything. The warriors already had a keen feeling that Pyo-Wol was a different being from them.It wasn\u2019t just his martial arts that were far stronger than them.The man in front of him was something different. Like a frog standing in front of a snake, there was something in him that stood out. Of course, the frogs were the warriors themselves.When Pyo-wol waved his hand, they ran away, leaving only Geum Si-yeon.Geum Si-yeon asked cautiously with a pale complexion,\u201cThen what should I do? If you need anything, please tell me.\u201d\u201cI told you. Don\u2019t disturb me for three days.\u201d\u201cWill that be all?\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s it.\u201d\u201cOkay. If you need more children, please let me know. There are many pretty girls besides Seolhyang in the Red Sky Pavilion.\u201d\u201cI will.\u201dPyo-wol nodded his head.It\u2019s not that he\u2019s tired of Seolhyang or that she\u2019s ugly.It was just that his desire was too strong. Even Seolhyang couldn\u2019t fully handle him. Seolhyang knew about it, so she didn\u2019t say anything.Seolhyang knew that she could not monopolize the man who covets her so tenaciously.Pyo-wol was never one to settle for one woman. To him, they were nothing more than an object to satisfy his momentary desires.Seolhyang thought it didn\u2019t matter.The man\u2019s scent emanating from Pyo-wol was too strong for her to think of complicated thoughts.Thud!Seolhyang closed the door.When Pyo-wol was nowhere to be seen, Si-yeon Geum breathed a sigh of relief.\u201cPhew!\u201dMany rumors spread in Batang over the incident.\u00a0The rumors which spread that throughout the Batang where such as that a minister1\u00a0visited and have bought all of the prostitutes, or that a powerful man came to the Red Sky Pavilion and voluntarily banned the business.\u00a0But the Red Sky Pavilion still did not open the door without saying anything.\u00a0Finally, after all three days, Seolhyang\u2019s services were opened again.Seolhyang was combing Pyowol\u2019s hair behind his back. Her eyes were filled with affectionate emotions as she used a fine comb.Seolhyang, who finally cleaned Pyo-wol\u2019s hair, carefully dressed him this time.It wasn\u2019t the shabby clothes he was wearing when he left the basement. It was a jeonui2\u00a0that Seolhyang specially ordered from a famous artisan in Batang.\u00a0Jeonui was the clothing worn by warriors during hunting or war, but the clothes Seolhyang ordered were engraved with colorful patterns and looked elegant.The cloak fit perfectly into Pyo-wol\u2019s body.Seolhyang wiped Pyo-wol\u2019s chest who was wearing the robe. There was deep affection in her hands.She asked cautiously,\u201cSangong, will I be able to see you again?\u201d\u201cIf there is a chance.\u201d\u201cI want to see you again. Please don\u2019t forget about me.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t forget you.\u201dPyo-wol\u2019s calm words brought a bright smile to Seolhyang\u2019s lips.Tears welled up in her eyes, but she was able to smile because she heard what she wanted to hear.Pyo-wol looked at her for a moment and then turned around. Waiting for him to come out were the strong-looking middle-aged warrior and the rest of his men.\u201cCan we talk for a moment?\u201dThe middle-aged warrior approached Pyo-wol.Oh myyy~ our MC\u2026 what a chad. Stealing girl\u2019s heart the moment he came out\u2013 (\u0e07 \u0e37\u25bf \u0e37)\u0e27 Don\u2019t forget to comment down below and let me know what you think of the chapter~ \u2661Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So, whenever he met people, Yu Jinsan looked into their eyes first.\u2018Eum\u2026\u2019As soon as he saw Pyo-wol\u2019s eyes, he felt his belief shake.Pyo-wol\u2019s eyes were completely unperturbed. It was not a matter of him revealing or hiding his emotions, it seemed that his emotions were deleted altogether.\u2018How can a person\u2019s eyes be like that?\u2019Even the eyes of the beast would not be like that.No, he had seen those eyes on a beast once.\u2018Damang!1\u2018The eyes of a giant snake he met in the rain forest when he went to Yunnan one day were like that. The snake was so huge, it could wrap itself around a large cow and suffocate it at once.\u00a0Yu Jin-san did not even dare to attack the beast and ran away.Pyo-wol\u2019s eyes reminded him of the damang.\u00a0Yu Jin-san felt the spine of his back get cold.He didn\u2019t know how much skill the man in front of him actually had, but it was impossible for a person with such eyes to be ordinary.Only then did he understand the words of his men who had run away with their tails between their legs.\u2014He used a bizarre magic trick! He just swung his hand and then suddenly I couldn\u2019t breathe!\u2014His eyes were really bloody! I can\u2019t explain it in words, but it was really scary. Just seeing his eyes was enough to make you give up.\u00a0If he had eyes like this, the reaction of his subordinates was only befitting.\u00a0 He, too, was unable to contain his reluctance to look at Pyo-wol.However, he was Yu Jin-san, the most powerful in the group.\u00a0He stepped forward, but when he saw his eyes, he unconsciously stepped back making his face fall on the floor. Some would call him stupid, but in Jianghu, protecting the body was the most important thing.A person whose face has fallen to the floor will be ridiculed by people, making it impossible to recover. Yu Jin-san, well aware of Jianghu\u2019s physiology, had no choice but to hesitate to step back.He said as he approached Pyo-wol,\u201cMy name is Yu Jin-san. I am the leader of Cheongok-gwan, the first military officer in Batang. What is your name?\u201d\u201cPyo-wol.\u201d\u201cPyo-wol? Where are you from?\u201d\u201cWhy do I have to tell you?\u201dAt Pyo-wol\u2019s words, Yu Jin-san\u2019s expression hardened.\u201cOur young friend here sure is short-tempered. It seems that you\u2019re not taught to be polite by your master.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! My master never taught me any of those manners.\u201dAll he learned was how to effectively kill his opponent. No one in the Blood Shadow Group had ever told him that he had to be polite when dealing with people.\u201cWhere is your master ? I\u2019ll have to meet your master and ask him.\u201d\u201cDead.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHe died a long time ago. All of them.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2013?\u201dAt Pyo-wol\u2019s short answer, Yu Jin-san felt speechless.\u201cAll the other members of my group are dead except for me, so if you have anything to say, you can go ahead and tell me.\u201dPyo-wol approached Yu Jin-san.For a moment, Yu Jin-san felt that Pyo-wol\u2019s movements were different from those of an ordinary person. It was clear that he saw him move, but there was no sound. It was as if a ghost was floating and approaching him.\u00a0It was then that Jinsan Yu realized that Pyo-wol was a greater master than he thought.\u2018This\u2013!\u2019A look of disappointment flashed across his face.\u201cThat bastard dares to tell the master\u2014\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s being so disrespectful!\u201dUnlike him, his subordinates did not understand the atmosphere and burst out in anger.The image of Pyo-wol appearing in such a disrespectful way to their leader, whom they looked up to like the sky, made them angry.\u2018You bastards! That\u2019s not it!\u2019Yu Jin-san cried out desperately in his heart.He wanted to get out of here. However, if his subordinates escalate the problem to such a greater extent, it might be impossible for them to back down.\u201cDamn it! Be polite.\u201d\u201cKneel down!\u201dBefore Yu Jin-san could dry, two men sprang out and attacked Pyo-wol. They were twins with the same body shape and the same face. In Batang, they were famous for their nickname of One Face, Two Wolves.2Two wolves with the same face were the words they were referring to.They usually thought of Yu Jin-san as the sky. When they thought that their master was being insulted by a kid they had never heard of, their anger soared to the top of their heads.\u201cOh, no\u2026!\u201dYu Jin-san tried to stop them belatedly, but their attack was already on the verge of stacking up on Pyo-wol.At that moment, Pyo-wol raised his right hand.\u201cArgh!\u201d\u201cKuk!\u201dAll of a sudden, the two brothers screamed and stopped with their attack.\u00a0 They couldn\u2019t move as if they had become stone statues. The twins were in extreme pain with all their veins bulging all over their body.The pain, like tens of thousands of ants crawling along their veins and biting them, drove them crazy.\u201cS, stop\u2026!\u201d\u201cS-Spare\u2013\u201dThe two brothers begged with foam in their mouths. However, there was no change in Pyo-wol\u2019s expression who\u2019s looking at them.He was thinking about other things.\u00a0\u2018This works well, too.\u2019The twins could not see it, but a thread of qi was flowing from Pyo-wol\u2019s finger and was connected to their body.Suhonsa.3A thread that takes the soul.Although it was only for a short time, the most impressive weapon Pyo-wol used after coming out of the underground cave was the Cheonjamsa.The uses of Cheonjamsa were endless.Depending on how it was used, it could be a great tool for killing, or it can be used to do arts that were impossible with only one\u2019s own strength.\u00a0However, Cheonjamsa was completely destroyed by the powerful blow of Mu Jeong-jin. After recovering to some extent, he wanted to use Cheonjamsa, but he couldn\u2019t find it in the underground cave.It was from then.Pyo-wol started to study Suhonsa.Its purpose was to release the qi inside the body to the outside, giving it a shape like Cheonjamsa.At first, of course, it failed.Only the masters of Jianghu can outwardly manifest their qi. However, they too, also needed a large medium like a sword or a dagger. At best, they could also use their hands as a medium.No one would have thought of making qi as thin as a thread, nor dared to even try.In order to extract the qi from the body and make it like a thread, a high degree of concentration, extremely delicate operation of the inner work, and a vast amount of internal energy were required.Pyo-wol, unaware of that fact, tried to make a thread of qi.He also suffered serious internal injuries due to reflux. But Pyo-wol did not give up.There wasn\u2019t much that could be done in the underground cavity anyway. He was engrossed in making a thread made out of qi, as if he had found a fun game.It was after seeing the movement of the snakes that he found a clue. When the snakes crawled on the floor, it was much easier to operate the qi.\u00a0It was the Sub-Thunder Snake method that helped with that.Pyo-wol\u2019s boundless imagination was supported by the essence of the Sub-Thunder Snake method. The whole process of thinking, revising, re-challenging, and supplementing were performed at a speed that ordinary people could not even imagine.A day on the eve of the month was equivalent to a few days for ordinary people.That\u2019s how Suhonsa was born.Although it had not yet taken the form of a sword or a dagger the substance certainly existed.Only Pyo-wol could feel and use it.\u00a0Pyo-wol used Suhonsa to infiltrate the blood veins of the twins. His control was still weak, so he could only use three or four. That was only the amount that could be freely used. Later on, as he gets more advanced, he will be able to use it on all of his ten fingers.\u201cSah, magic\u2013\u201dYoo Jin-san shouted in surprise.The martial arts that Pyo-Wol put so much effort into seemed like magic in his eyes. It was the same for the other warriors.Even if they knew, they could not see it, and at their level, no matter what they did, they could not understand the reality of Pyo-wol\u2019s work.\u201cKekkeuk!\u201d\u201cGarrgh!\u201dThe two brothers were on the verge of dying.Still, neither Yu Jin-san nor the other members of the Cheongok-gwan dared to attack Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol\u2019s presence was overwhelming.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t because he did any remarkable martial arts, or used overwhelming violence, he just performed a strange skill.\u00a0But they instinctively felt it.That the man in front of him was something different.The fact that there is something primal in him that makes people afraid.\u2018I\u2019ll be devoured.\u2019Yu Jin-san once again recalled the damang he had seen in Yunnan.Although he was the best warrior in Batang, he was nothing more than a regional leader on the outskirts of Sichuan. The leading sects in Sichuan did not even consider Cheongok-gwan a proper sect.He forgot his pride and knelt down.\u201cYoung Master! Please save them. I have no eyes, so I was rude to you. Please forgive me. I beg you like this!\u201dYu Jin-san used to live with pride. Saving face used to be more important than life, but not at this moment.\u00a0 He felt a deep fear that he could not even dare to attack Pyo-wol. This feeling was the first in his life.Just looking at Pyo-wol made his neck numb with a cold sweat running down his back.It doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s alone, but if he makes a mistake, the Cheongok-gwan could be annihilated.Pyo-wol looked at Yu Jin-san.\u00a0Yu Jin-san was banging his head on the floor as he begged.At that time, a middle-aged woman approached Pyo-wol.It was Geum Si-yeon, the owner of the Red Sky Pavilion. Geum Si-yeon bowed her head. Pyo-wol looked at her and she handed him something.\u201cI\u2019ve packed a few things for you to eat on the way. You\u2019ll be able to fill up your stomach when you go out.\u201dWhat she brought out was a small container with food.Pyo-wol noticed that Geum Si-yeon was quite wise.She didn\u2019t ask Pyo-wol to forgive her or just leave. She just give him the utmost care she could, and that alone greatly eased the harsh atmosphere.Her experience of working in the entertainment industry for a long time served as a buffer between Pyowol and Yu Jin-san.\u2018Amazing\u2026\u2019The act of changing the atmosphere in an instant was never easy. In particular, for a person who lacked human relationships like Pyo-wol, he could not emulate the act.\u00a0Pyo-wol smiled slightly and released the Suhonsa. Immediately after, the twins fell on the floor, breathing heavily. Their faces were full of fear.They closed their eyes, unable to even look at Pyo-wol.\u00a0Having confirmed the power of Suhonsa, there was no longer any use for them.\u00a0Pyo-wol silently accepted the package from Geum Si-yeon. It seemed that it was not just food that was packed since the weight was heavy. Still, he didn\u2019t say a word of thanks.Pyo-wol glanced at Yu Jin-san and took a step forward. Yu Jin-san was shaking and trembling but he did not dare to stop Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol passed through the crowd and exited the Red Sky Pavilion.As his appearance disappeared, the Yu Jin-san and the rest of the Cheongok-gwan breathed a sigh of relief.\u201cPhew!\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dIn that brief encounter they experienced hell.It was the first time they realized that people can be so scary.Geum Si-yeon came to Yu Jin-san\u2019s side.\u201cLord Jin-san! Are you okay?\u201d\u201cWho is that man?\u201d\u201cHe was just a random visitor.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t even know?\u201dGeum Si-yeon looked at Seolhyang at Yu Jin-san\u2019s question.Among them, Seolhyang was the person who spent the longest time with Pyo-wol. If it was her, she might know the answer to the question. However, even Seolhyang shook her head to express that she did not know.\u201cHaa\u2026 Looks like the storm has passed. What a mess.\u201dYu Jin-san shook his head. In that brief moment, his face looked much older.Geum Si-yeon understood what Yu Jin-san meant. It was because she was also nervous while Pyo-wol was staying at the Red Sky Pavilion.\u00a0Even now, both her mind and body were a mess.Fortunately, things went well.She comforted Yu Jin-san.\u201cYou did well. The quick and good judgment saved the Cheongok-gwan.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s time to retire. I saw the reaper in front of me and didn\u2019t recognize it.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right about that.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s comforting. Where do you think his next destination is?\u201d\u201cHow would I know that? But I think I know one thing.\u201d\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u201cThat a terrifying killer has appeared in Jianghu.\u201d\u201cHuuu\u2026I feel the same way. Where did such a person come from? Sooner or later, Jianghu will be turned upside down.\u201d\u201cWill you inform the great sects?\u201d\u201cWhy would I tell them?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re the the sects of Sichuan that\u2014\u201d\u201cWill they even listen to me? They\u2019ll just be ridiculing us saying it\u2019s mere nonsense from the villagers in the countryside. One humiliation is enough.\u201dYu Jin-san shook his head and looked in the direction where Pyo-wol disappeared.\u201cThey have to experience it themselves to learn a lesson.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 43": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 43Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter leaving Batang, Pyo-wol walked through the east towards Guangdong.\u00a0All the cities in Sichuan Province were connected to Chengdu. Chengdu was the center of the gathering of the inner culture of Sichuan.The destination of Pyo-wol was Chengdu.He was thinking of going to Chengdu to learn about the Qingcheng and the Emei sect.Seven years have already passed, but Pyo-wol never forgot his resentment against them even for a single moment.He could choose to live in a quiet place. After all, it has already been seven years. No one would have an issue about it since they know that Pyo-wol was already buried. Pyo-wol was already a forgotten man in the world.If he just stayed still, it\u2019s possible for him to live in peace.\u00a0But Pyo-wol couldn\u2019t do that.The world may have forgotten him, but he never forgot his past.For fourteen years, he was locked in darkness and had to live a life that was inferior to that of a human being. Such a past was not something that could be easily forgotten.Pyo-wol was well aware that if he did not shake off the past, he would not be able to take even a single step toward the future.But Pyo-wol is not the kind of person who forgets his grudges.From the moment he was kidnapped by the Blood Shadow Group and forcibly turned into an assassin, he never forgot his grievances, not even for a single day.Although the Blood Shadow Group has disappeared from the world, the Emei sect, who was the root cause, is still alive and well.Pyo-wol couldn\u2019t just leave them alone and know that they were doing well as they continued taking advantage of others.Seolhyang and the courtesans did not know much about the Emei sect. Since the area called Batang is on the outskirts of Sichuan Province, there was no proper information coming in.That was the reason Pyo-wol left Batang and headed towards Chengdu for six days.Pyo-wol was not in a hurry.He wanted to see the world he hadn\u2019t seen in a long time. So he walked slowly as much as possible, fully taking in the scenery around him.After walking for a while, he got hungry.He took a seat in a suitable place and unpacked his luggage. Then, a bowl of food made by the master of the Red Sky Pavilion appeared.The bamboo bowl contained rice and simple side dishes. But there was something that caught his eye even more than that.There was a 30-nyang silver slip and a few coins. It seemed that Geum Si-yeon was looking out for him. But Pyo-wol did not know how much thirty silver nyang were worth.Having been locked up in an underground cave for fourteen years, he had no choice but to lose his sense of the true value of money.Pyo-wol touched the slip for a while, then put it in his bosom and ate.He knew it when he was living with Seolhyang, but the Red Sky Pavilion\u2019s food was delicious. Even simple food had a deep taste.Thanks to this, Pyo-wol was able to have a pleasant meal.The thing he liked the most after going out into the world was that he could enjoy eating delicious meals to his heart\u2019s content.As he ate delicious food, Pyo-wol realized that he was also human.When he was trapped in the underground cave for the second time and lived with the snakes, he seemed to have become a snake himself.Thanks to that, he adapted and managed to survive, but he had no desire to go back to that time again.The soft taste of rice in his mouth made him realize that he was alive. Pyo-wol chewed little by little and fully savored the taste of the food.The wind blew.It was a fresh wind that could not be felt in the underground cave. Pyo-wol stopped eating and felt the wind. A lot of information was contained in a single wind.\u201cIt\u2019s going to rain soon.\u201dThe wind was full of moisture that was about to pour at any moment. Furthermore, it felt like the incoming rain would not stop anytime soon.Pyo-wol got up from his seat after roughly tidying up.As he looked around to find a place to shelter from the rain, he saw a closed tomb in his sight.It must have been abandoned a long time ago, so the tomb was half-destroyed. Still, it seemed like he could use it to escape the rain for a day or so.Shortly after Pyo-wol entered the tomb, it started to rain.Hududuk!Heavy raindrops fell nonstop on the roof.Pyo-wol sat leaning against a pillar and watched the rain fall. It had been a long time since he had seen the rain coldly pouring down like this.Pyo-wol closed his eyes and muttered.\u201cJong (\uc885\uad6c\ub098).\u201dThe best thing about being out in the world was him being able to feel the change.There was little change in the underground cave.\u00a0It was the same life, the same environment. There was no sense of the passage of time, and you could not expect that something would change.The outside world, on the other hand, was different.Every day was different. It seems like a continuation of similar days, but there was never a single day that was exactly the same.Pyo-wol suddenly thought that it would be nice to have alcohol. But alcohol was forbidden to an assassin.This was because alcohol dulls the nerves and slows the body\u2019s reactions.That was then.Tak! Tak!\u00a0The sound of footsteps was heard in Pyo-wol\u2019s ears.Someone was walking through the rain.After a while, someone appeared at the entrance to the Gwanjeon Tomb.1\u201cAh! What\u2019s this? Now, I\u2019m all wet.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I told you to hurry. You sissy. This is because you\u2019re so slow.\u201d\u201cAmitabul! Fortunately, we found the Gwanjeon tomb, so stop fighting.\u201dThe combination of people who entered the Gwanjeon tomb, who were as wet as a mouse, was very strange.A woman who appears to be in her mid-twenties, a taoist monk who appears to be in his early sixties, and even a middle-aged buddhist monk. The unique group of three people rushed to avoid the rain.As soon as they entered the tomb, the woman lifted the hem of her robe and shouted at the old taoist.\u00a0\u201cMy underwear is all wet. What am I going to do? Go Dosa!2\u00a0What am I going to do?\u201d\u201cWhy are you asking me that? Is it my fault that your clothes got wet?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the Go Dosa\u2019s fault since it\u2019s you who got lost and wandered around. So, Go Dosa must take responsibility.\u201d\u201cSick!\u201d3Go Dosa turned his head at the woman\u2019s bizarre logic.The middle-aged monk shook his head at the quarrel between the two and murmured.\u201cAmitabha Buddha! Blessed One who has prepared for great mercy, why are you giving me such an ordeal? Out of the many people, why must I be accompanied by the two of them.\u201d\u201cUh-huh? Anyone who hears you would think you\u2019re also normal. Because it\u2019s not true.\u201dThe woman\u2019s target this time was a middle-aged monk.At her attack, the monk closed his eyes tightly and gave up fighting. A satisfied smile appeared on the woman\u2019s face.\u201cHmpf.\u201dThe woman put her arms around her waist with a triumphant expression on her face. Her appearance was so bewitching. Since her clothes were wet from the rain, her clothes clung and revealed her curvaceous body.\u00a0The woman looked around the inside of the Gwanjeon Tomb.\u201cOh? Someone\u2019s here.\u201dShe belatedly discovered Pyo-wol, who was leaning on a pillar.With her words, both the taoist and buddhist monks looked at Pyo-wol.\u201cOh! Someone came before us.\u201d\u201cAmitabha!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so handsome, oraboni.4\u00a0To meet such a handsome man on a mountain like this. Such great luck has come to me.\u201d\u201cThis is all my luck since I got lost. You should thank me.\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201d\u201cAmitabha Buddha! Amitabha Buddha! When the hell is this ordeal going to end?\u201dThe three were still noisy.A woman approached Pyo-wol.\u201cHello, handsome Oraboni! It\u2019s a coincidence that we stayed in the same place like this, but we don\u2019t even know your name. I\u2019m Ran-ju, Heo Ran-ju! What about you, oraboni?\u201d\u201cPyo-wol.\u201d\u201cOh! Such a cool name.\u201dSeeing the twinkling eyes of Heo Ran-ju, Go Dosa shook his head.\u201cThat bitch, she\u2019s at it again. Why can\u2019t she just stop fawning over handsome men.\u201d\u201cEven so, he\u2019s really handsome. Even a man can fall for him.\u201d\u201cCorrupt! Isn\u2019t existence itself a nuisance? He\u2019s filthy and handsome.\u201dHis words were harsh, but even Go Dosa could not hide his admiration.The man in front of them is handsome. Really handsome.\u00a0It was a strange atmosphere.Heo Ran-ju\u2019s fuss was understandable. She was trembling with excitement as she went closer to Pyo-wol.\u201cBut where is this handsome oraboni going?\u201d\u201cChengdu.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s such a coincidence that we\u2019re going to Chengdu, too! I think we should go together. Right? You can save on expenses, you won\u2019t be bored and you can also be with me.\u201dHeo Ran-ju wrinkled her eye. Seeing her like that, Go Dosa had an expression that looked like he was going to get sick at any moment.Heo Ran-ju got angry and beckoned to him.\u201cDon\u2019t be silly there and say hi to this handsome oraboni.\u201d\u201cYou look older than him. How can he be your older brother?\u201d\u201cIf someone\u2019s handsome, they\u2019re all my older brothers. It\u2019s all the same.\u201dGo Dosa and the buddhist monk approached Pyo-wol with a look of helplessness. Then, Heo Ran-ju introduced both sides.\u201cDid you hear? This handsome oraboni is Pyo-wol, and this is the Go Dosa, Dosande Seonggo. So, Go Dosa. This one here in the middle is Hyeol Seung. He has memorized every single Buddhist sutra \u201d\u201cNice to meet you. I\u2019m called Go Dosa.\u201d\u201cAmitabul! I\u2019m Hyeol Seung.\u201dGo Dosa and the Hyeol Seung greeted Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol looked at their faces and opened his mouth.\u201cPyo-wol.\u201d\u201cWhat happened to our handsome Pyo-wol\u2019s group?\u201d\u201cNone.\u201d\u201cYou mean you have no companions?\u201d\u201cWhy? Is there a problem?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201dGo Dosa carefully looked at Pyo-wol. He had a slender body with no prominent muscles. It was unreasonable to see him as a person who had mastered martial arts.\u00a0However, Go Dosa was not deceived by such appearances.\u2018I\u2019m sure he has learned some martial arts, but I\u2019m not sure what level he is.\u2019Go Dosa had a lot of experience in Jianghu. He had fought numerous battles, and Heo Ran-ju was practically raised the same as him.\u00a0\u2018Even though that bitch has a bad temper, she\u2019s excellent in martial arts. But we can\u2019t gauge that guy\u2019s level at all.\u2019Without mastering martial arts, he would not be able to show that kind of leisure against strangers. It must mean that he believed in his own prowess for him to not shrink even when he saw strangers.The problem is that they can\u2019t measure the level of Pyo-wol.Go Dosa looked at Hyeol Seung.He was trying to communicate without words.\u00a0Hyeol Seung knew what the Go Dosa\u2019s eyes meant. He shrugged. That, too, meant that Pyo-wol\u2019s skill could not be measured.\u2018This guy! He\u2019s more fun than I thought.\u2019The Go Dosa\u2019s eyes sparkled.\u201cDid you say you were going to Chengdu? Why are you going there?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to know.\u201d\u201cUh-huh! Don\u2019t be like that, let\u2019s be friends. If we get to know each other, even a long journey won\u2019t be boring.\u201dGo Dosa sat down next to Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol looked at the Go Dosa, Heo Ran-ju, and Hyeol Seung without a change in expression.As was the case with Heo Ran-ju, Go Dosa\u2019s nudging was also above the average level. No one would dare approach Pyo-wol if he treated them so coldly, but they didn\u2019t care.There was no sign of shame, let alone an angry expression. It meant that their courage was great or strong.\u2018They\u2019re all skilled.\u2019Heo Ran-ju looked like she had no weapons. However, Pyo-wol recognized that the black object Heo Ran-ju was wearing around her waist like a stick was a whip.The shiny appearance and tight texture was telling him that the material of the whip was unusual.Go Dosa had a sword on his back, while Hyeol Seung was holding a fire pit with a ring.Since each weapon used was different, it was natural that the martial arts they learned were also different. Still, Pyo-wol thought that they had mastered doing group battle because the position they naturally occupied was the best position for a pincer attack.It was not intentionally set up that way. It has been repeated for a long time, and such position has been engraved into their body.\u2018Their center is Heo Ran-ju.\u2019The three of them seemed to be on equal footing, but as he looked closely, he could see that it is Heo Ran-ju who is taking the initiative.Go Dosa and the buddhist monk were murmuring, but they were faithfully obeying her words.They were well-disciplined. And they were thoroughly united around Heo Ran-ju. However, as he further observed Heo Ran-ju, he didn\u2019t see the inclination of her being a leader.\u00a0\u2018There is someone. There\u2019s another strong person above them. Dosa and Hyeol Seung follow that person.\u2019Pyo-wol thought it was fun.Heo Ran-ju, however, did not seem to be satisfied with the free tendencies of Dosa or Hyeol Seung. If someone can command those three people, then it is clear that their leader had great leadership or possessed a great force.\u2018Or he possesses both qualities.\u2019Their destination was also Chengdu. If so, as he travels with them to Chengdu, he will naturally know who is the one leading them.Heo Ran-ju was crumpled.\u201cWhat about you handsome oraboni? Join us. I\u2019ll be very nice to you.\u201d\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go together.\u201d\u201cUh, really?\u201dHeo Ran-ju\u2019s eyes widened at Pyo-wol\u2019s unexpected answer.Her face was filled with bewilderment.Yay new characters~Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After leaving the Gwanjeon tomb, Pyo-wol moved with the group of Go Dosa.Go Dosa was very knowledgeable about geography. He seemed to know where to go so Pyo-wol didn\u2019t have trouble in having to find the way.\u201cWhy is our handsome oraboni going to Chengdu?\u201dHeo Ran-ju walked close to Pyo-wol.With every step she took, her large chest gently brushed against Pyo-wol\u2019s elbow. Whether she knew this or not, Heo Ran-ju looked at Pyo-wol with innocent eyes.\u201cI want to meet someone I know.\u201d\u201cSomeone you know? Who?\u201d\u201cThey are a lot.\u201d\u201cWho the hell are they?\u201d\u201cDebtor.\u201d\u201cDebtor? Are you in debt?\u201d\u201cNo, they\u2019re the ones who owe me.\u201d\u201cThen are you going to get them?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThose bad bastards! Why aren\u2019t they paying off their debts to our handsome oraboni? Who are they? Just tell me. I\u2019ll take them all!\u201dHeo Ran-ju was angry as if she was the one who\u2019s the creditor. Go Dosa and Hyeol Seung2\u00a0looked at Heo Ran-ju with a pathetic expression.\u2018Hopefully, I\u2019ll untie the skirt here.\u2019\u2018There\u2019s a lot of honey dripping from her eyes.\u2019Heo Ran-ju naturally put her arms around Pyo-wol. Pyo-wol knew about it, but he didn\u2019t say anything. Then, Heo Ran-ju got closer and talked more.\u201cWe met by chance at Gwanjeon tomb, and our destination is the same. This is also a relationship. What do you think? Perhaps the heavens made us meet.\u201d\u201cWhy are you going to Chengdu?\u201d\u201cUs?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWe are going to do some business\u2026\u201d\u201cWithout any items?\u201d\u201cBecause we don\u2019t necessarily sell items that are visible. Can you guess what we\u2019re selling?\u201d\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI feel like my mouth will be stitched up when I hear the answer.\u201d\u201cHmpf!\u201dHeo Ran-ju pouted her lips at Pyo-wol\u2019s answer. Her expression was so rich that it was unbelievable that she was in her mid-twenties.If it were any other man, he would surely be mesmerized by her appearance. Women who are sensual and yet have a protective instinct are not that common.But Pyo-wol was different.No matter what kind of expression she made or what kind of talent she had, he didn\u2019t feel very impressed.If it\u2019s a woman, he had already embraced them to the point where he\u2019s tired of it in the Red Sky Pavilion. It didn\u2019t mean that his desire completely disappeared, but he wasn\u2019t stupid enough to fall for the aegyo of a woman he didn\u2019t even know about and to lose his reasoning.Instead, Heo Ran-ju clung to Pyo-wol.\u201cWhoa, Oraboni doesn\u2019t know how to push and pull. I heard my heart very much. I\u2019m gonna tremble and die.\u201d (\u201c\uc6b0\uc640! \uc624\ub77c\ubc84\ub2c8, \ubc00\uace0 \ub2f9\uae30\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc7a5\ub09c \uc544\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc544\uc8fc \ub0b4 \ub9c8\uc74c\uc744 \ub4e4\uc5c8\ub2e4 \ub1a8\ub2e4 \ud558\ub124. \uc0b4 \ub5a8\ub824 \uc8fd\uaca0\ub124.\u201d)\u201cHey! Would you just like to stay here? Just get a room then.\u201dGo Dosa said something, but Heo Ran-ju pretended not to listen. Hyeol Seung comforted Go Dosa with a soft voice.\u201cWhen has she even listened to others? Don\u2019t get too upset.\u201d\u201cUpset? Do you know how many years I have seen that bitch\u2019s bad attitude?\u201dGo Dosa also lowered his voice so that Pyo-wol could not hear him, and answered.\u201cAren\u2019t we going to be late for our appointment?\u201d\u201cIf we get on a boat, we\u2019ll be able to arrive at roughly the same time.\u201d\u201cThank god.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the one guiding you, so what are you worried about? Hyeol Seung, don\u2019t even think about anything and just follow me.\u201d\u201cIs that so? Can I leave those two like that?\u201dHyeol Seung\u2019s eyes turned to Pyo-wol and Heo Ran-ju.For a moment, Go Dosa smirked.\u201cWhy, she\u2019s actually doing well. Her aegyo towards a person is a sign she\u2019s planning something. I\u2019m scared every time that bitch does that. It\u2019s a calculated act.\u201d\u201cIs that really a calculated move?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cI seriously thought that she liked him.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Do you think the Blood Lord of the Heavens [\ud608\uc9c0\uc8fc(\u8840\u9c8d\u59b9)] will be holed up by a man one day? You should say something that makes sense.\u201d\u201cYeah, right?\u201d\u201cOf course, he\u2019s a guy with a lot of questionable aspects, and he seems pretty reticent, so she\u2019ll have to put a lot of effort into getting information.\u201dGo Dosa\u2019s eyes who was looking at Pyo-wol were cold.This was a very important time.Even the smallest variable was unacceptable. Existences that might interfere must be identified and removed in advance so that there is no repercussion.Up until now, they have lived that way and have survived because they acted that way.Go Dosa quickly changed his expression. He approached a sailor with a friendly face and asked for the ship\u2019s schedule of departure.\u00a0After chatting with the sailor for a while, he returned to the party and said,\u201cWe\u2019re lucky. It\u2019s supposed to leave after half an hour, so we can get on it right away.\u201d\u201cCan I get on that boat? It looks like they\u2019ve loaded a lot of luggage.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a rice carrier, so there\u2019s nothing we can do about it. If you want to choose another boat, you will have to wait another day. It\u2019s best to take this boat because we can\u2019t waste time.\u201d\u00a0\u201cSheesh! If it\u2019s a rice carrier, don\u2019t expect a comfortable bed. I miss having a soft bed.\u201d\u201cDamn it! You talk a lot. Hey, bitch! If you miss a soft bed like that, then why are you following me?\u201d\u201cHow can I do that? If I did, Danju1\u00a0wouldn\u2019t let it go.\u201d\u201cThen don\u2019t talk and follow me. Oops! You don\u2019t know what to do without me.\u201dWhen Heo Ran-ju backed down, Go Dosa pressed his temples with both hands as if he had a headache.\u201cAmitabul! Let\u2019s get on the boat.\u201dHyeol Seung got on the boat first with a tired expression.Pyo-wol also bought a ticket.It was his first time using money, so he was amazed. Pyo-wol had been staring at the bill exchanged for money for a long time, so Heo Ran-ju approached him and said,\u201cThat slip will be enough. Let\u2019s get on the boat.\u201dShe grabbed Pyo-wol\u2019s hand and dragged it.Pyo-wol meekly followed her.It was said to be a rice carrier, so grains were piled up like a mountain on the deck and dock of the ship.He had never seen such a large amount of grain before. As he stared blankly at the grain, the Taoist said,\u201cIsn\u2019t this a little too much? It\u2019s rice harvested last year, but they say it\u2019s going to Chengdu.\u201d\u201cTo Chengdu?\u201d\u201cAll the products of Sichuan Province gather in Chengdu. The same goes for rice. With this amount, hundreds of people can live on it for a year.\u201dAlthough the name was a rice carrier, there were quite a few passengers on the ship. Sailors also need to earn pocket money, so they accept passengers on the surplus seats.The passengers were gathering and talking.Some of them had their faces frowned as they were having a serious conversation, while others were smiling constantly. It seemed that there were as many different expressions as there were people.Pyo-wol looked at them without a word.Most of the people on the ship were ordinary people who had nothing to do with their strength.Pyo-wol thought they were lucky. Pyo-wol is the person who knows best how difficult it is to live an ordinary life in Jianghu.When Pyo-wol couldn\u2019t take his eyes off the people, Heo Ran-joo asked.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d\u201cOh, nothing much.\u201d\u201cHuh! So you also have a sentimental side.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard it.\u201d\u201cReally? You looked sentimental in my eyes.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re going to keep talking nonsense, just shut up. It hurts my ears.\u201d\u201cToo much!\u201dAt Pyo-wol\u2019s cold words, Heo Ran-ju had a wounded expression on her face. But then, as if nothing happened, she acted bashful and held on to Pyo-wol\u2019s arms.\u201cThat\u2019s more attractive. I can\u2019t stand it. Shall we go somewhere else for a moment?\u201d\u201cWhere?\u201d\u201cA place where the people\u2019s eyes cannot reach.\u201dHeo Ran-ju pressed her chest to Pyo-wol\u2019s elbow. Pyo-wol looked at Heo Ran-ju without saying anything for a moment. Then, Heo Ran-ju smiled even more bewitchingly.Heo Ran-ju was beautiful enough to make any man\u2019s heart tremble. However, Pyo-wol did not fall for her smile.She had a smile on his lips that seemed to attract people, but her eyes were as cold as ice.If it had been a man other than Pyo-wol, they would have been mesmerized by her smile. That\u2019s how good she was at deceiving her feelings. But she couldn\u2019t fool Pyo-Wol\u2019s eyes.Pyo-wol was used to understanding the psychology and emotions of others.No matter how she hid her inner self with a bright look, he was able to read the atmosphere and emotions that flowed inside of her.Heo Ran-ju was a rose with poisonous thorns.It was obvious that he would be seriously injured if he grabbed hold of her by falling for her gorgeous appearance.Pyo-wol gently shook his head.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit difficult here. I\u2019ll think about it after we get off the ship.\u201d\u201cSheesh! You look like an expensive man. Well, that\u2019s attractive too, so it doesn\u2019t matter. Ho-ho!\u201dHeo Ran-ju burst into laughter. Everyone around looked at Heo Ran-ju. She was beautiful enough to attract the attention of others. Many people were already spying on her from the moment she boarded the ship.Go Dosa said to Heo Ran-ju.\u201cStop joking, come and have a drink.\u201d\u201cWho said it was a joke?\u201d\u201cEverything you do is a joke.\u201d\u201cThis damn scoundrel\u2026\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re not drinking?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019ll drink.\u201dHeo Ran-ju sat down in front of Go Dosa while grumbling. Then, the old taoist gun opened wide. Four bottles of wine were hung inside his cannon.Go Dosa took out one of them and said to Pyo-wol.\u201cWould you like to have a drink too? Nothing\u2019s as good as having a drink on a long road trip.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cIs that so? It\u2019s weird for a young man to refuse to drink.\u201dGo Dosa didn\u2019t bother to recommend it twice. He drank, received and gave alcohol with Heo Ran-ju and Hyeol Seung.Meanwhile, the ship left the pier.Pyo-wol sat on the railing and watched the flowing scenery. The fact that he sat quietly and admired the surrounding scenery gave Pyo-wol a strange impression.On one side, Heo Ran-ju and his party were drinking and chatting.They were two people who couldn\u2019t stand each other normally. But when they drank, they laughed and talked as if they had ever done it again.Hyeol Seung was also drinking alcohol to set the mood.Heo Ran-ju, who knew Pyo-wol was looking at her, slowly turned her head to look. When their eyes met, she gave her a characteristic bewitching smile.\u201cThis year! I\u2019m messing around again.\u201dAfter hearing a word from the late master, Heo Ran-ju Heo concentrated on drinking again.Thud! Thud!At that moment, a strange noise reached Pyo-wol\u2019s ear.Pyo-wol looked in the direction the sound was coming from.Nothing could be seen yet. But since the sound is getting louder little by little, it seemed like it would appear if I waited a little longer.No one on the ship, including Heo Ran-ju and others, could hear the sound. Pyo-wol frowned and stared forward. After a while, the identity of the strange noise was revealed.A ship was approaching at a rapid pace. There were numerous oars on both sides of the ship. The sound he heard was the sound of rowing.\u201cUh, what is that?\u201d\u201cAnother ship is approaching!\u201dThe sailors who discovered the ship late, trembled. At their cry, the passengers and the captain looked at the approaching ship. The captain\u2019s face, who had been looking at the ship for a long time, was distorted.\u201cDamn it! We\u2019re outnumbered.\u201d\u201cOutnumbered?\u201d\u201cOh my God!\u201dThe passengers were agitated. The enemies were approaching, aiming for the rice loaded on the rice carrier. The closer the ship got, the clearer their identity was. All the enemies were holding weapons.\u201cIf we take the rice from that boat, we can eat to our heart\u2019s content for a while.\u201dThe eyes of the enemies were full of greed.The rice carrier ran at full speed with its sails wide open to shake off the enemies. However, it was impossible to shake off the enemies who were rowing fast.\u00a0As time passed, the gap was narrowed.In the end, the captain had to make a decision.\u201cEveryone, raise your arms. We must protect rice no matter what.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe sailors took their harpoons and swords. A look of nervousness was evident on their faces. Although they were forced to grab a weapon as a self-defense measure, they could not stop their body from trembling.Recently, a number of enemies targeting the rice carrier have been appearing frequently.The enemies didn\u2019t just steal rice, they also took people\u2019s lives. Because of that, the rice transport line has been frequently haunted for the longest time.\u201cThis was not an area where the enemies usually appear. Did they advance to this place?\u201dThe captain muttered with a puzzled expression.If it was an area where enemies often appear, they would have been well prepared. But since there have never been any enemies here, they did not hire martial artists.Someone approached the captain and talked to him.\u201cLooks like you\u2019re quite in a bit of trouble.\u201d\u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who I am. What matters is what I can do.\u201dIt was Go Dosa who waved the bottle of alcohol in front of the captain with his face red.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cHow much would you give me to protect the rice? Can you tell me?\u201dHe began to bargain with the captain.Hmm, here we go again with the new characters. Names are so difficult to translate\u2026 Anyway, don\u2019t forget to comment down below and let me know what you think of the chapter~ \u2661Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 45": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 45Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe captain looked at Go Dosa with a puzzled expression.\u201cNo, what do you mean? Your life is at stake, but you\u2019re here negotiating? Do you think they\u2019ll just take the rice?\u201d\u201cExactly. If you want to protect your rice and your life, you have to pay a certain price.\u201dGo Dosa laughed slyly.\u201cPrice? If the enemies come in and attack, you will also die, so what do you mean by price? You\u2019re really crazy.\u201d\u201cHuh! Me, crazy? Can a crazy person do this?\u201dPouck!When the Go Dosa pointed with his finger, the anchor line thicker than an adult\u2019s forearm exploded because of the intense firing.\u00a0\u201cEueum!\u201dOnly then did the captain realize that the man in front of him was a warrior who had mastered martial arts. If it was at a level enough to materialize internal energy without the help of a weapon, his level was worthy of being considered high.\u201cCan you deal with them all alone?\u201d\u201cI guess it\u2019s too much now that I\u2019m older and my bones aren\u2019t as strong as before.\u201d\u201cThen it\u2019s no use.\u201d\u201cUh-huh! Why are people so quick-tempered? When did I ever say I was alone?\u201dGo Dosa pointed to Heo Ran-ju and Hyeol Seung behind him.The captain frowned heavily. He didn\u2019t feel good about it. But he had no choice.\u201cOkay! If you keep both the rice and the people safe, I\u2019ll pay you a hundred nyang.\u201d\u201cNo. Who\u2019s going to meddle with someone\u2019s problem with just a hundred nyang?\u201d\u201cOne hundred hermits is enough money for your family to spend five years in abundance.\u201d\u201cBut compared to the price of rice on this ship, it\u2019s only a small amount.\u201d\u201cHow about two hundred nyang\u2014\u201d\u201cFive hundred nyang!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s too expensive! That\u2019s enough to buy three percent of the rice on board.\u201d\u201cHeh! It\u2019s cheaper if we can save all your life and rice at a price of only three percent.\u201d\u201cUgh! This is daylight robbery\u2014\u201dThe captain shivered. A conflicted expression was evident on his face. If acquiesce to the five hundred nyang to the Go Dosa as it is, there will be no gain for them in this voyage.But even at that moment, the enemies\u2019 ship was getting closer and closer. The distance between the two ships is now about a dozen meters.\u00a0The captain had to make a decision.\u201cO\u2013Okay, fine! If you can really defeat them, I\u2019ll give you five hundred nyang.\u201d\u201cHeh, you made a good decision.\u201dAs Go Dosa smiled and turned around, he saw Heo Ran-ju and Hyeol Seung.Heo Ran-ju asked.\u201cHow much is it?\u201d\u201cFive hundred nyang!\u201d\u201cHey! That\u2019s all you can do?\u201d\u201cFor now, let\u2019s be satisfied with this, because we can already hit two birds with one stone.\u201d\u201cTwo birds with one stone?\u201d\u201cIf we want to sell our armed forces, don\u2019t we have to promote it? It\u2019s a perfect opportunity to make a mark on the Emei and the Qingcheng sect.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see their reactions!\u201dHeo Ran-ju burst into laughter.Go Dosa smiled and said to Hyeol Seung.\u201cCome on, I\u2019ve laid out the stage, so let\u2019s run wild.\u201d\u201cWhy do you have to make me do this?\u201d\u201cYou really don\u2019t know?\u201d\u201cAmitabha!\u201d\u201cGo wild and do what you do best.\u201dGo Dosa waved his hand as if to hurry. After a moment\u2019s sigh, Hyeol Seung turned his head to look at the ship where the enemies were on.The enemies who approached the rice carrier were preparing to climb with their weapons.\u201cAmitabha Buddha! Blessed One who has prepared for greatness, please forgive this sinful disciple.\u201dPheut!Hyeol Seung spurned the deck with a fire pit and flew into the air.The body of Hyeol Seung, who had reached the highest point, turned over and crashed into the ship the enemies were on.Kwaang!With his landing, the boat with the enemies on board shook violently as if it would sink at any moment.\u201cUwa\u2013!\u201d\u201cWhat, what?\u201dThe enemies could not balance themselves and fell over. They tried to regain their balance.\u201cWhat? Is that a dangjung (monk)?\u201d\u201cCareful! He looks strong.\u201dThe enemies cautiously approached the Hyeol Seung.\u00a0\u201cHyaap!\u201dThud!At that moment, Hyeol Seung hit the bottom of the boat with a fire pit. Then the ship shook violently again, as if there had been an earthquake. However, the enemies were prepared this time, so they did not fall unnaturally.That was then.Puhwahak!The floor that had been hit by the fire burst and the water spurted out. The Buddhist monk made a hole in the bottom of the boat.\u00a0The enemies furiously rushed towards Hyeol Seung.\u00a0\u201cDie!\u201dAt that moment, Hyeol Seung spread out his palms towards the enemies who rushed at him.Poeing!\u201cKeuk!\u201d\u201cHiic!\u201dThe enemies who were hit by the strong pressure, bounced back and fell into the water. Those who fell into the water were swaying in the waves without moving as if they had lost their breath.\u201cYou crazy bastard.\u201d\u201cEveryone attack together!\u201dWhen the enemies saw their comrades dipping in the water, they became even more furious and rushed altogether. But what greeted them was the fire of Hyeol Seung.\u00a0Kwasiiik!\u201cKekkeuk!\u201d\u201cCoheuk!\u201dWith the sound of breaking bones, the two enemies that had been hit by the fire were thrown out.Hyeol Seung\u2019s hands were cruel.\u00a0Every technique he used was intense and powerful.Among the enemies, there were those who had mastered the martial arts, but none of them could stop the fire of the buddhist monk.If they block the attack with their hand, their hands will break, and if they block with a sword, both their sword and bones will be broken.It was truly a destructive force.\u00a0Heo Ran-ju leaned her upper body against the railing and watched Hyeol Seung running wild.\u201cHuh! There is no human being who speaks and acts like that.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that why his nickname is blood monk? That\u2019s what they call him because he\u2019s crazy about blood.\u201dGo Dosa smirked as he wiped the sweat from his forehead with a fan. There was no sign of anxiety anywhere on their faces. That\u2019s because they believe in Hyeung Seung.\u00a0Hyeung Seung might get caught in between the two of them everyday and gets picked on, but his skills were real.When hit by the hands of a blood monk, no doubt it would be a serious injury.The condition of the surviving enemies was miserable enough that it was better for them to lose their lives. Arms and legs were either deformed, broken, or a hollow bone piercing or portruding through the skin.\u00a0The crew and passengers on the rice carrier had their eyes closed at the terrible sight.Not long ago, they were trembling for fear of losing their lives, but now they are looking at the enemies with a sympathetic gaze.In particular, the captain looked at Go Dosa and Heo Ran-ju, who were casually chatting with each other.Heo Ran-ju, who had been chatting with the Go Dosa for a long time, clapped her hand as if she had suddenly been reminded of something.\u00a0\u201cAh! How\u2019s our handsome oraboni? You\u2019re not scared, are you? Ugh! If I knew it would end up like this, I would have told Hyeol Seung to take it easy.\u201dWhen she looked at Pyo-wol, Dosa smirked.\u201cDo you think that\u2019s a scared face?\u201dHeo Ran-ju\u2019s gaze moved along the fingers of the Go Dosa. Her gaze was soon directed towards Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol was sitting on the railing, watching the spectacle of Hyeol Seong running wildly with an indifferent expression.\u00a0It was a face that a frightened person would never be able to make.\u201cThat guy, he\u2019s not an ordinary person. You can\u2019t have eyes like that without being a guy who\u2019s been through a lot of turmoil.\u201d\u201cWhere did that oraboni come from? We already know most of the famous masters in Sichuan.\u201d\u201cNot everyone. So what did you find out?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201d\u201cWhat? You didn\u2019t find out anything while you were stuck with him together like that? It seems that everything is over now. We can\u2019t figure out the identity of that guy.\u201d\u201cI feel the same way as you, Go Dosa. He\u2019s not an ordinary person. I can\u2019t read him. I was so sure he\u2019ll give in to me, but I can\u2019t seem to dig deep inside his heart.\u201dHeo Ran-ju bit her nails.Go Dosa clicked his tongue at her, whose self-esteem had been already severely damaged.\u201cTsk! Anyway, if you don\u2019t want to create a variable, find out about him, or Danju will be disappointed.\u201d\u201cHeh! That\u2019s never going to happen. I bought mine too, so I can\u2019t stand it until I get it. Sooner or later, I will know about everything. Just wait and see see.\u201d\u201cYeah, if you say so.\u201dThat was then.Kwang!There was a huge explosion that could not be compared to anything before.\u00a0Silence came.In the ship where the enemies were boarded, only Hyeol Seung stood alone. All the enemies were submerged in the water.Among them was the head of the enemies.Although they were quite strong in martial arts, they could not be an opponent of Hyeol Seung. In just three seconds, they were bloodied and were thrown into the water. They did not come up again.\u00a0Hyeol Seung jumped off the enemies\u2019 boat and climbed onto the rice carrier.Shortly after he landed, the enemies\u2019 ships disappeared completely below the surface of the water.Passengers and sailors looked at the Hyeol Seung with fearful eyes. But Hyeol Seung was quite familiar with this kind of gaze, so he had a casual expression on his face.\u201cGood job. Hyeol Seung!\u201d\u201cAmitabha, please order Ranju instead of me next time.\u201d\u201cDoes she even follow what I tell her? It\u2019s already good if I don\u2019t get insulted or sworn at. Heh heh!\u201dGo Dosa smirked and approached the captain. The captain was surprised and stepped back.\u00a0Go Dosa reached out to the captain.\u201cOkay, now that we\u2019ve done all the work, you\u2019ll have to pay the bill.\u201d\u201cOh, here you go!\u201dThe captain handed over five hundred silver coins without saying a word.He obviously hired three people. But he couldn\u2019t dare ask why they fought alone instead of the three of them. But despite the inaction of the two, what Hyeol Seung showed was too great.Even the blood monk already had this level of indifference, so he couldn\u2019t even guess how strong the Go Dosa or Heo Ran-ju would be.\u201cThat was a good deal.\u201dGo Dosa came towards Hyeol Seung with a pouch containing the silver coins. But Heo Ran-ju was nowhere to be seen.\u201cUh, what about that bitch?\u201dHyeol Seung silently pointed to Pyo-wol.Heo Ran-ju was already close to Pyo-wol. Pyo-wol wasn\u2019t paying her any attention, but Heo Ran-joo continued to talk and smile towards him.\u00a0Go Dosa frowned.\u201cYou told her to seduce the guy, did you not?\u201dThe sight of her twisting her body and smiling at him made him feel a bit uneasy. Whether or not Heo Ran-ju knew the worries of the Go Dosa, she whispered to Pyo-wol who had his arms crossed.\u201cWhen we get to Chengdu, do you have a place to stay? If not, how about going with us?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cWhy? Is it because of Hyeol Seung? As you can see, he\u2019s usually gentle. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m more comfortable being alone.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so unusual, rejecting a beautiful woman who\u2019s usually so favored.\u201d\u201cEven if it\u2019s a flower, it\u2019s not good to have a rose with poison.\u201d\u00a0Heo Ran-ju\u2019s forehead twitched slightly at Pyo-wol\u2019s nonchalant words. But even then, she smiled brightly with an innocent expression.\u201cStill, it\u2019s pretty.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true that the apperace is pretty.\u201d\u201cWow! How could you say that to a woman? I\u2019m hurt now.\u201dHeo Ran-ju grabbed her chest and look like she was about to faint. But Pyo-wol\u2019s eyes looking at her were still cold.The brute force shown by the blood monk just before was very impressive.Although the enemy\u2019s prowess was not great, it was clear that they were still powerful even if they had no striking aspect.Although he couldn\u2019t confirm it with my own eyes, Dosa and Heo Ran-ju must be similar to Hyeol Seung in terms of their martial arts skill.\u00a0Those three people were heading to Chengdu at the same time as Pyo-wol. There were many things that were ingenious to dismiss it as a mere coincidence.\u2018The biggest problem is their objective for them to go to Chengdu\u2026\u201dPyo-wol looked at Hyeol Seung.\u00a0When the three of them were together, he was the most insignificant. However, after the incident happened, Heo Ran-ju and Go Dosa put Hyeol Seung to the front.It felt as if they deliberately placed Hyeol Seung to the frontlines, when it was something Heo Ran-ju or the Go Dosa could have handled quietly.\u00a0The reason is unknown, but it was clear that the armed demonstration they showed just now was meant to be shown to someone.\u2018Who do they want to show it to? What do they gain from this?\u2019Pyo-wol once again looked closely at Heo Ran-ju.Heo Ran-ju was wearing revealing clothes. In particular, the chest area was clearly visible. Pyo-wol looked at Heo Ran-ju\u2019s chest.\u00a0To be precise, he saw the wounds passing over her chest.The wound was so deep that an ordinary person would have stopped breathing immediately. Deep wounds were seen not only on the chest but also on the forearm. It wasn\u2019t just an injury suffered during training.\u00a0It was a testament to the battle between life and death. She probably has more wounds in the other areas covered by her clothes.No matter how tough Jianghu is, the fights were not always so fierce that martial artists suffered such deep wounds. Unless they were participating in a war, it was rare for someone to suffer so much damage.\u2018They are mercenaries selling their skills for money. They are now demonstrating their force for\u00a0 their client to see so they can be hired.\u2019The enemies that came were nothing more than pitiful sacrifices to increase their payment.\u2018Is there a conflict happening in Chengdu that there\u2019s a need for independent mercenaries?\u2019Pyo-wol thought things were going to be fun.Chengdu is the center of Sichuan.Under normal circumstances, the sects of Sichuan, such as the Emei and Qingcheng, would have not tolerated such conflict in Chengdu.But since a conflict was allowed to happen in Sichuan meant that the Emei and Qingcheng sect were not in a good position to intervene and fix it.\u00a0Maybe seven years ago, the seeds of destruction he had sown had sprouted.Pyo-wol smiled, and Heo Ran-ju looked at him.His smile was so eerily beautiful that she even felt the chills.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

From now on, they had to move by land instead of by water. There were wagons already waiting to load rice at the dock.\u201cHurry up! I have to go to Chengdu tomorrow.\u201d\u201cBe careful not to burst the sack!\u201dWorkers got on the boat and started unloading the rice.Pyo-wol and Heo Ran-ju also got off the boat.Go Dosa stretched out.\u201cI think I will be able to live again if I step on the ground.\u201d\u201cAre you saying you\u2019ve been sick for a few days? It\u2019s not like you\u2019re getting any old.\u201d\u201cWhy is this bitching starting a fight again? Are you sexually frustrated huh?\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u201cEhem, nothing.\u201dWhen Heo Ran-ju raised her eyebrows and grabbed the whip, Go Dosa took a step back. He deliberately spoke to Pyo-wol.\u201cWhat are you going to do now?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going to go straight to Chengdu.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to stay here for one day.\u201dIt was already evening time. There was no reason to rush out. Go Dosa made a disappointing expression on his face.\u201cThen we must separate here. Since we have to arrive in Chengdu by tomorrow morning.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you just go with us?\u201dHeo Ran-ju, standing next to the late taoist, had a pitiful expression on her face.\u201cI have something to prepare\u2014\u201d\u201cWhat preparations? I\u2019ll help. Let\u2019s go together.\u201d\u201cI need to do it alone.\u201d\u201cTsk!\u201dHeo Ran-joo licked her lips at Pyo-wol\u2019s resolute answer. A look of sadness was evident on her face. But that was not enough to shake Pyo-wol\u2019s heart.\u201cI\u2019ll contact you later when I go to Chengdu.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dHeo Ran-joo relaxed his expression as if she liked Pyo-wol\u2019s answer.The three of them bought horses at a nearby horse market and set off right away.Pyo-wol, who was left alone, looked for a guesthouse nearby.All cargo loaded onto the ship was unloaded from there and loaded onto carts. Since this is a place where a huge amount of cargo goes through, there were a lot of large passengers that stayed in the area.The guest house, which Pyo-wol visited, was one of those places.The inside of the guest house was already crowded with people. Most of them came from high-ranking countries. They were sitting together and eating.As Pyo-wol looked around, a waiter1\u00a0approached him.\u00a0\u201cWelcome. Meals or lodging?\u201d\u201cBoth.\u201d\u201cAh! So you\u2019re going to stay to eat and sleep.\u201d\u201cIs there a room?\u201d\u201cThere is a room left. But it\u2019s a little expensive\u2026\u201d\u201cHow much?\u201d\u201cTen coins. And the cost of food is two. As you can see, the seats are full, so even you will have to wait for a little while.\u201dPyo-wol silently took a coin from his pocket and counted it.\u201cHehe! Go up this floor and follow it all the way to the left corridor, you will find a room at the end. You can stay and sleep there.\u201d\u201cOkay. Bring me my meal first.\u201d\u201cYes, wait a minute!\u201dAfter giving a quick reply, the waiter ran to the kitchen.Pyo-wol looked at the waiter for a moment, then found an empty seat and sat down.\u201cHey, look! What kind of bastard is prettier than a girl?\u201d\u201cIs he really a man? Isn\u2019t he a girl disguised as a man?\u201dThe martial artists who were nearby looked at the Pyo-wol and gossiped.\u00a0They weren\u2019t the only ones. Most of the people nearby were staring blankly at Pyo-wol. It wsa because Pyo-wol\u2019s appearance stood out.\u00a0Pyo-wol didn\u2019t even care about the chatter of people.He knew how great his appearance was.He was handsome in the first place, but not to this extent. After spending seven years with the snakes, Pyo-wol\u2019s appearance became so beautiful for a relationship.\u00a0He didn\u2019t even know maybe it was the effect of having been with snakes for a long time.He thought it didn\u2019t matter at all.There was no need to deprecate himself just because he was seen as beautiful and not necessarily handsome. Having a beautiful appearance was also a great weapon.Coming from the underground cave to this place, Pyo-wol was aware of that fact.The women who fell for his appearance lowered their guards, and they provided a lot of information to Pyo-wol, both knowingly and unconsciously.Such information was of great help to Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol tapped the table with his finger and waited for the food to come out.Fortunately, the food came out quickly.The waiter asked while putting down the food.\u201cBy the way, would you like some alcohol? The sake brewed directly in our guesthouse is amazing.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t drink.\u201d\u201cOkay, if you change your mind, call me anytime.\u201dThe waiter nodded his head at Pyo-wol and went back to his place.Pyo-wol ate with chopsticks.At first, chopsticks felt unfamiliar. He hasn\u2019t used chopsticks in over 14 years. So he missed getting the side dishes several times. But he soon got used to using chopsticks.Pyo-wol savored the food little by little.It was just the level of food that you can taste at any other restaurant. He couldn\u2019t say it was particularly delicious. But to Pyo-wol, even such cheap food felt like heaven.This moment was the greatest luxury of his life.People here will not know how fortunate they were to pay a fair price and eat the right food.He could feel the sweetness of each grain of rice in his mouth.There was a smile on the corner of Pyo-wol\u2019s lips.That was then.\u201cHey! You\u2019re a guy, right?\u201dAn unusually large warrior approached Pyo-wol.He was wearing a sleeveless top which showed off his muscles. His forearms, exposed outside his clothes, were as thick as the torso of any woman. His face was also quite rough, and just looking at it would give anyone goosebumps.Pyo-wol looked up at the man with the chopsticks still in his hand. Then, the man revealed his yellow teeth and grinned.\u201cMy name is Jang Woo-rak. A member of the Gujin Pyoguk (Gujin Escort Company)2.\u201d\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cI made a bet with my co-workers, if you strip your clothes, they will give me a silver if you have a pepper.\u201d\u00a0Jang Woo-rak looked at Pyo-wol who was in the left corner, smirking. There, the leaders of the Gujin Pyoguk had gathered. They were looking at Pyo-wol with a look of interest.Pyo-wol asked with an indifferent expression.\u201cSo which side did you take?\u201d\u201cI bet that you\u2019re a girl disguised as a man.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. You\u2019ll lose two coins.\u201d\u201cThen you\u2019re a man?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019d better throw away those eyes. Can\u2019t you see properly?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Huh!\u201dJang Woo-rak let out a sinister laugh.\u201cHeh heh! Come on, take it off and let me check it out.\u201d\u201cIf you take it off, I will buy you alcohol.\u201dJang Woo-rak\u2019s colleagues whistled and shouted.\u00a0The other people who were in the guest house looked at the scene with interest. They knew that the members of the Gujin Pyoguk were making spiteful pranks, but they had no intention of intervening.\u00a0Because what was happening in front of them was both exciting and entertaining.They wondered.What kind of response will the man who looks like a woman show?They thought that maybe he would shed tears and squeal like a bitch.Jang Woo-rak clasped his big hand and said,\u201cCome on, let\u2019s see where the peppers are\u2014 Keuk!\u201dSuddenly, Jang Woo-rak let out a desperate scream.In the eyes of such Jang Woo-rak, thin chopsticks were stuck imperceptibly.\u00a0It was the chopsticks in Pyo-wol\u2019s hand.\u201cYou, you! You crazy bastard! My eyes\u2014\u201dJang Woo-rak looked at Pyo-wol, clutching his eyes that were stabbed with chopsticks. Blood was dripping from his left eye.Pyo-wol got up from his seat.\u201cIf you can\u2019t see what\u2019s right in front of you, it\u2019d be better for you to not have your eyes. I\u2019ll take your other eye now.\u201d\u201cWhat? N-No!\u201dJang Woo-rak hurriedly backed away. The speed at which he was approaching was much faster than the speed at which he retreated.Pyo-wol approached Jang Woo-rak without making a sound.Only then did Jang Woo-rak see Pyo-wol\u2019s eyes.His serpent\u2019s eyes, which had no emotion, were staring at him. Only then did Jang Woo-rak realize that he had mistakenly touched the wrong opponent.\u00a0A person with eyes like his couldn\u2019t be normal.Pyo-wol\u2019s face was the last scene he saw.Puk!\u201cKeugh! My eyes!\u201dWith the eerie attack, Jang Woo-rak\u2019s world turned into darkness.\u201cHey! You crazy bastard\u2014!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThe complexion of the head of the Gujin Pyoguk, who had been watching with an interesting expression so far, has changed to a greenish color.Chopsticks were stuck in Jang Woo-rak\u2019s eyes. He cannot avoid being blind by taking out the chopsticks. He never thought\u00a0 that there would be a madman who would poke his eyes out with just one remark.It was also a man who looked as beautiful as a girl.They jumped over the table and ran towards Pyo-wol. All of a sudden, they had weapons such as swords and daggers in their hands.They were planning to attack Pyo-wol and save Jang Woo-rak.Pupupuk!\u201cKaak!\u201d\u201cHiic!\u201dBut before they could even get close, they screamed and collapsed. They had chopsticks stuck to their shoulders and sides.It was thrown by Pyo-wol.\u201cUh, h-how?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t even see him throw.\u201dThe martial artists who were nearby were appalled.Although they acted rudely like a gangster, the leaders of the Gujin Pyoguk were still quite recognizable experts.Gujin Pyo-guk was a medium-sized escort company in Sichuan Province. It was entirely thanks to their strength that they were able to grow, even when they just started their company.Because of that, they were very proud of themselves, and gradually became unruly. It was for the same reason that Jang Woo-rak tried to harass Pyo-wol.He found his target, and thought of molesting and humiliating him because he looked like a girl.The only problem was that Pyo-wol turned out to be at a level they could not offend.Pyo-wol had a cold expression. Suddenly, he had chopsticks in his hand. He used Suhonsa to pick up a bunch of chopsticks.Bang!\u201cGeurgk!\u201dWith the sound of chopsticks hitting the wall, one of the members of Gujin Pyoguk screamed desperately.The chopsticks that Pyo-wol had thrown pierced his shoulder and made him stuck on the wall. The man struggled to remove the chopsticks stuck in his shoulder, but it was so deeply embedded that he couldn\u2019t pull them out by himself.\u201cYou crazy bastard! Do you know who we are?!\u201dGong Jin-hyeok , the oldest of the Gujin Pyoguk members, shouted.In an instant, four people from the Gujin Pyoguk, including Jang Woo-rak, were suppressed by Pyo-wol.\u00a0The results were too fatal just because they made fun of a person because of his appearance.The pyodus3\u00a0here were the real power of the Gujin Pyoguk. Since they were now either blind or wounded, they could not even dream of working for a while.The fate of Pyoguk, whose members could be active, was dim.\u00a0That was then.Sreuk!Suddenly, Pyo-wol appeared in front of Gong Jin-hyeok.Gong Jin-hyeok was surprised to see Pyo-Wol who ignored the distance and appeared without any sign. The moment he saw Pyo-wol\u2019s sunken eyes, he felt goosebumps all over his body.Pyo-wol was looking at him with eyes that couldn\u2019t be defined. It would have been less scary if his eyes were as cold as ice or full of life.But the perfectly still eyes that show no emotion stimulated the feeling of fear deep inside Gong Jin-hyeok\u2019s heart.\u2019\u201cKugh!\u201dGong Jin-hyeok let out a moan without knowing it.Pyo-wol pushed his face up to his nose and opened his mouth.\u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cThat, that\u2026\u201d\u201cTell me. Who are you guys?\u201d\u201cKeuk, we are the me-members of the Gu, Gujin Pyo-Pyoguk\u2013\u201d\u201cSo? What do you guys do?\u201d\u201cI\u2013\u201dGong Jin-hyeok could not speak properly.An invisible, intangible energy seemed to squeeze his heart.His face turned pale, and cold sweat was pouring down his body like rain, as if his whole body had run out of breath.\u201cDid you think you\u2019d be okay if you touch someone just because they look pretty? What, were you thinking of buying me? So you\u2019re just going to take my clothes off and check me out? Do you still want to do that?\u201d\u201cNo, no\u2014 Never.\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t lived in the world for very long, but I do know one thing. You have to take responsibility for what you do. If you touch a person, you have to pay a price. What do you think?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201dGong Jin-hyeok couldn\u2019t answer.It was because he had an intuition that his fate would change depending on his answer.It was just a prank.Pyo-wol looked like a girl, so they were interested, and as a result, obscene words that can usually be shared between men came out.They want to see if he\u2019s really a man.They said it would be fun to take off his pants and reveal his nether regions.They thought there would be no problem.It was because Pyo-wol was alone and did not appear to have mastered martial arts. If they later apologized by saying it was a joke, they thought it would end without any problems.\u2018But what is this?\u2019Jang Woo-rak, who played a prank, was now blinded and screaming, and his other colleagues were struggling like worms pierced by chopsticks.What on earth is this nightmare sight?He couldn\u2019t understand if they had done something so bad that they deserved this outcome.That was then.Bang!\u201cHey! That\u2019s enough. There\u2019s a lot of other people here, but it\u2019s the situation is like this.\u201dAnother martial artist, who was sitting on the other side of Pyo-wol, smashed the table and said. His name is Oh Won-hoo. He was a man who had been friends with Gujin Pyoguk for a long time.When Oh Won-hoo appeared, Gong Jin-hyeok had an ecstatic expression on his face.\u201cOh. Daehyup! Keukhyuk!\u201dSuddenly, Gong Jin-hyeok screamed.Chopsticks were lodged in his shoulder, and the figure of Pyo-wol disappeared.Pyo-wol was standing in front of Oh Won-hoo.\u201cWhy would I stop?\u201dDon\u2019t forget to comment down below and let me know what you think of the chapter~ \u2661Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Oh Won-hoo was a well-known master in Sichuan. But such a master could not sense the movement of Pyo-wol at all.The opponent in front of him was more stronger than he expected.Pyo-wol asked again.\u201cStop what?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that enough? They must be reflecting too.\u201d\u201cWho decides that?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWho decides that enough is enough?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is a matter between me and them, but why are you saying that it\u2019s enough? This matter can only end when I think it\u2019s good enough.\u201d\u201cWell, there is a line in everything. I just wanted you to keep that boundary.\u201d\u201cLine?\u201d\u201cThere is a line of common sense, a line of discipline, and there are lines that need to be drawn somehow.\u201d\u201cBut why didn\u2019t you keep that line?\u201dIn an instant, Oh Won-hoo\u2019s eyes turned to Gong Jin-Hyeok.He stepped up because of his personal friendship with them, but he really didn\u2019t really expect that Pyo-wol would be such a non-communicative person.He regretted going out of his own way. But now he couldn\u2019t withdraw his remarks.Because everyone in the guest house was looking at them.In Jianghu, face1\u00a0was more important than anything else.The reason that he was able to receive treatment and work until now was because he had never suffered any loss of his face.\u2018Shit!\u2019In his mind, he wanted to pull out his sword and hit Pyo-wol\u2019s neck right away. But his opponent\u2019s inaction didn\u2019t seem so accommodating.The leader of the Gujin Pyoguk was also a master with excellent martial arts skills. But those people were immediately suppressed using chopsticks thrown by their opponent, and now they were still groaning in pain.It was true that Oh Won-hoo\u2019s martial arts were superior to those of the Gujin Pyo-guk, but it was not enough to subdue all of the members in an instant.Pyo-wol asked again.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you keep the line?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201dHis fate will depend on what kind of answer he gives here.A light of conflict appeared on Oh Won-hoo\u2019s face.\u00a0An arc was drawn on Pyo-wol\u2019s lips. The moment Pyo-wol\u2019s white teeth were exposed through his red lips, Oh Won-hoo felt a threatening feeling.He had the illusion that the chopsticks in Pyo-wol\u2019s hand would pierce his head at any moment.\u201cHiic! Don\u2019t look at me like that.\u201dOh Won-hoo suddenly drew his sword and tried to swing it.Shiik!Before his sword could even be pulled out, it was already blocked by Pyo-wol.All human body parts are connected as one. While it might seem that the hands and feet are acting independently, but in reality, both can move organically if the two show cooperation.With the slight trembling around Oh Won-hoo\u2019s eyes and the spasm of his shoulder muscles, Pyo-wol was able to predict Oh Won-hoo\u2019s next action.Above all, Pyo-wol was able to roughly grasp his intentions through his opponent\u2019s eyes.Pyo-wol called this ability of his own fine sense.2During his time in the dark, his fine senses developed terribly.\u00a0His pair of eyes might be looking at the Oh Won-hoo who\u2019s right in front of him, but his other senses were still spread out enough to sense even the breath of every single person in the room.\u201cHeuk!\u201dOh Won-hoo raised his internal energy to pull out the sword.Tuk!At that moment, Pyo-wol\u2019s finger touched his elbow.\u201cKerheuck!\u201dSuddenly Oh Won-hoo let out a scream. His arms were bent to the opposite side. Pyo-wol\u2019s simple hand movements destroyed his elbow joint.People nearby widened their eyes. They could not comprehend the situation that was right before their eyes.Oh Won-hoo was a master who could protect his body with his internal strength. But he couldn\u2019t believe that his elbow had been destroyed by just a simple touch of Pyo-wol.What was happening right before his eyes was completely beyond his common sense.But it was no coincidence.It was the product of the bloody hard work of Pyo-wol.Trapped alone in the dark, Pyo-wol wondered how to effectively neutralize or destroy humans.He thought and he thought, and continued to imagine.He merged the martial arts he already knew into one, and fused the cultivation methods. He even got inspiration from the snake pit.The martial art that was born from this way was Agudo (\u7e54\u9b3c\u9053)3.It\u2019s a hungry man\u2019s martial arts.Pyo-wol did not forget the hunger he felt when he first entered the underground cave.The desperate memories of having to scrape off the moss on the wall to survive.So, he named the martial arts he created Agudo.The technique that Pyo-wol used to destroy Oh Won-hu\u2019s elbow was the human body destruction technique4, which was the basis of Aguido.Pyo-wol thought that the structure of the human body was complex yet simple.It would be infinitely complicated if you dug deep, but in simple terms, the human body was made up of axis and joints.He thought that if he destroyed the joint that connects one shaft to the other, he could easily incapacitate the opponent. From then on, Pyo-wol thought about how to effectively destroy the opponent\u2019s joints.Thus, this kind of human body destruction technique was born.It attacks and destroys parts that humans cannot train.\u00a0Oh Won-hoo\u2019s elbow was shattered. No matter how good a doctor is, his elboy cannot be completely cured.\u201cThis bastard\u2014!\u201dOh Won-hoo held out his shaky arms and unfolded his technique.It was a technique called Mayeonggak5.\u00a0However, his attack did not reach Pyo-wol. Because Pyo-wol\u2019s fist was shot like an awl and smashed his knee.Pergioc!\u201cKeuk!\u201dOh Won-hoo collapsed with a scream.However, when Oh Won-hoo collapsed at this point, the inside of the guest house became quiet.Many of the people in the guest house were warriors who had mastered martial arts. However, even with their eyes, they could not tell what method Pyo-wol had used to destroy Oh Won-hoo.An unidentified martial artist who instantly destroys a master like Oh Won-hoo and who steals his opponent\u2019s eyes just by doing a bit of dirty talk.\u00a0In their eyes, Pyo-wol no longer looked pretty.Behind that beautiful and seductive appearance, the cruel hands and killing intent made them frightened.\u2018A Killing Star has appeared.6\u2018Where the hell did this guy\u2014?\u201dThey never heard of such a man in Jianghu.At least in Sichuan.Pyo-wol grabbed Oh Won-hoo\u2019s collar and looked into his eyes.\u201cUgh!\u201dOh Won-hoo\u2019s eyes shook relentlessly in fear.His pants were getting wet.He was urinating without knowing it in extreme fear.Pyo-wol asked.\u201cYou still want to meddle?\u201d\u201cAh, ah, no\u2014\u201dOh Won-hoo shook his head violently. Because of that, he stuttered but he didn\u2019t think it was embarrassing. His mind was filled with only the thought of not wanting to see Pyo-wol\u2019s eyes again.It was then that he released the hand holding him.Talcuck!Oh Won-hoo\u2019s body collapsed.Tears flowed from his eyes. Shame and pain belatedly came rushing in like a tide.Seeing Oh Won-hoo cry, the atmosphere of the warriors was somber.They didn\u2019t say anything. But in their heart they thought they were lucky that they didn\u2019t come forward.Since he was humiliated like that, Oh Won-hoo\u2019s life as a warrior was almost over. He suffered indelible wounds not only physically but also mentally, making it impossible to recover.Pyo-wol looked inside the guest house.\u00a0The warriors eagerly turned or bowed their heads to avoid making eye contact with him.In an instant, a few people had their lives ended as martial artists, but no one wanted to meddle anymore.Seeing Oh Won-hoo was enough for them to know that meddling was futile.\u00a0Pyo-wol didn\u2019t say anything and went back to his seat. And casually ate his left over food. The figure of Pyo-wol left a strong impression on people.\u2018A crazy man has appeared.\u2019\u2018He\u2019s a person that can never be matched.\u2019\u2018The atmosphere of Chengu is so bad that even crazy people appear like this.\u2019Whether or not he knew the thoughts of such people, Pyo-wol continued to use his chopsticks.Clack! Clack!Only the sound of chopsticks hitting the bowl resounded in the silent guest house.* * *\u201cHuyuu\u2026 Why is the atmosphere here so bloody.\u201dThe old taoist looked around Chengdu and murmured.Half of those who walked down the street seemed to be armed.In general, no matter how large a city is, the proportion of martial artists is small. If there were a hundred people, there were only one or two warriors. However, the percentage in Chengdu was excessively high.It was proof that the public security was so unstable that even ordinary people carried weapons.Heo Ran-ju said with a smirk.\u201cIt\u2019s a great opportunity for us.\u201d\u201cOther people\u2019s misfortune is our chance, what kind of tragedy is this? Amitabha!\u201d\u201cHong! You shouldn\u2019t say things like that, even if you don\u2019t know other people.\u201d\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s the most money-hungry person among us?\u201d\u201cWhy are you so recklessly collecting money that you don\u2019t even give to the Buddha?\u201d\u201cAmitabha Buddha! Blessed Sakyamuni. Please forgive this evil sentient being.\u201d\u201cFuck you.\u201dHeo Ran-ju snorted, and Go Dosa said,\u201cStop the bullshit and let\u2019s go to the place where Danju is. You know that he doesn\u2019t have much patience.\u201dWhen he mentioned \u2018Danju\u2019, the expressions of Heo Ran-ju and Hyeol Seung expression became serious.\u00a0They hurriedly followed the old taoist.\u00a0The place where the Go Dosa brought them was the largest guest house in Chengdu. It was still early in the morning, but there were several customers eating breakfast in the guest house.A pleasant light flashed in Heo Ran-ju\u2019s eyes as she looked around the inside of the cup.\u201cDanju!\u201dShe approached the men who were eating. Then the men who were eating raised their heads in unison\u00a0 and looked at Heo Lan Chu.Among them, a man who appeared to be in his mid to late forties opened his mouth.\u201cBudanju! You\u2019ve arrived on time.\u201d\u201cWow! It\u2019s been a while. Danju oraboni.\u201dHeo Ran-ju hugged the man tightly.The man patted Heo Ran-ju\u2019s back. The Go Dosa and Hyeol Seung, who arrived late, greeted the man.\u201cIt seems that you have become more dedicated, Danju.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve seen you, my lord!\u201dThe man moved away from Heo Ran-ju and said,\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve finally met again after a long time.\u201d\u201cHehe! Isn\u2019t there a lot of work to do?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I get a good rest thanks to you?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s already a problem because I\u2019m too rested. I\u2019ve run out of money.\u201d\u201cSo why didn\u2019t you call us right away?\u201d\u201cAre you really going to get involved in this?\u201d\u201cDo you feel burdened? Then drop out.\u201d\u201cAh! Why are you arguing again\u2026 Someone\u2019s missing.\u201dThe old taoist shook his head and sat down quickly. Hyeol Seung and Heo Ran-ju also sat in the empty seats.There was a firm trust in the eyes of the three who looked at the man.The man\u2019s name was Zhang Mu-ryang, the leader of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group.7The Black Cloud Group was a kind of mercenary group.They sold their arms for money.Their main stage was at the disputed area of \u200b\u200bthe border.It didn\u2019t matter who the client was. They fought on their behalf by entrusting themselves to a place that gave them even a little more money.People called them a group of money-crazed killers.Rogues who only chase after money without any justice or cause.They gathered in Chengdu because Zhang Mu-ryang smelled the money.The old taoist rubbed his palms and said.\u201cIs it because of the Qingcheng and Emei sect?\u201d\u201cYou must have heard the rumors.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it true that everyone already knows that the two sects have been at odds since seven years ago?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. The atmosphere seems like there will be a big clash sooner or later.\u201dZhang Mu-ryang nodded his head.I don\u2019t know what exactly happened, but the Qingcheng sect and the Emei sect have been at odds since seven years ago.\u00a0At first, there was an atmosphere where only a few warriors collided, but it soon escalated into an all-out fight. They collided heavily, inflicted many casualties, retreated, and fought again several times.The confrontation between the two most powerful sects in Sichuan Province resulted in the division of the Sichuan powerhouses.Among the sects in Sichuan, there were no clans that did not have a connection with the two sects.\u00a0Many sects tried to stay at the middle ground in the beginning, but as the confrontation between the two sects grew longer, they were increasingly forced to choose.Eventually, the sects of Sichuan were split into two.Heo Ran-ju asked Zhang Mu-ryang,\u201cWhy the hell are they fighting? They\u2019re both prestigious sects recognized by Jianghu.\u201d\u201cBudanju! It doesn\u2019t matter why they fight. What matters is that we have a chance to make our dreams come true.\u201dZhang Mu-ryan smiled.The battle between the Qingcheng sect and Emei sect was a great disaster for all who live in Sichuan Province.\u00a0But unfortunately, it was a golden opportunity for the Black Cloud Mercenary Group and Zhang Mu-ryang.Don\u2019t forget to comment down below and let me know what you think of the chapter~ \u2661Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They immediately approached the seat where Zhang Mu-ryang was sitting.ghy\u201cDanju! What? Ranju is already here.\u201d\u201cYou bear cub! That\u2019s why I told you to hurry.\u201d\u201cShit!\u201dThe two of them quarreled and approached Zhang Mu-ryang. Both appeared to be in their early to mid thirties. One was overweight and the other had a cold appearance.Heo Ran-ju looked at the two and snorted.\u201cHong! If Danju said to assemble, of course I would immediately come.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so noisy. It seems that the old fern water has risen more.\u201dA man with a large body looked at Heo Ran-ju up and down. Heo Ran-ju flaunted her chest even more by squeezing it between her arms thus making her breasts stand out.\u201cPretty, right?\u201d\u201cWill you give me a shot?\u201d\u201cHeh! You perverted bastard. You won\u2019t eat it even if I give it to you.\u201dDespite Heo Ran-ju\u2019s insulting remarks, the large man didn\u2019t make a single distasteful expression, but rather smirked.\u201cIs that my fault? What should I do if I just don\u2019t feel the desire towards girls?\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re only coveting guys like you?\u201d\u201cHeh heh heh!\u201dHeo Ran-ju shook her head when the large man gave a sinister laugh.The name of the man with the large body was Oh Yuk-pyo. Oh Yuk-pyo was a man whose hobby was sodomy. Heo Ran-ju looked at the man who had come with Oh Yuk-pyo.The name of the man who was now sitting next to Zhang Mu-ryang was Yang Woo-jung. He was in the same position as Heo Ran-ju.If Heo Ran-ju leads the atmosphere of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group with her unique charm, Yang Woo-jung holds the discipline of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group using his sharp reasoning and relentless demeanor.Zhang Mu-ryang opened his mouth.\u201cYou worked hard to come a long way. What about the other guys?\u201d\u201cThey are all dispersed and staying in different guest houses.\u201d\u201cGood job. Listen to me from now on. This is important for the future.\u201dEveryone remained silent at Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s words. Usually, the Black Cloud Mercenary Group had a free atmosphere, but when they entered work mode, they oasted a discipline stronger than any other group.\u201cGo Dosa.\u201d\u201cTell me, Danju.\u201d\u201cFirst, gather information in Sichuan. We need to find out which sects belonged to the Emei faction and which sects followed the Qingcheng faction.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dGo Dosa nodded.Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s gaze turned to Yang Woo-jung.\u201cThe head of Yang, takes a few children to the Qingcheng sect. Poke to see if there is room for negotiation, and negotiate how much you can get.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d\u201cRanju!\u201d\u201cYep!\u201d\u201cYou go to the Emei sect. You know what to know without me saying anything, right?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cIf you can\u2019t understand the atmosphere, you can\u2019t even eat porridge or rice.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I know it well.\u201d\u201cOkay! Five pieces.\u201d\u201cYes! Captain.\u201d\u201cYou keep a good eye on Ranju. If anything happens, report it immediately.\u201d\u201cWhy do I have to be with this girl\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an order.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dOh Yuk-pyo replied with a look of not being able to do anything. Heo Ran-ju raised a brow and looked at Zhang Mu-ryang.\u201cCan\u2019t I rather move together with Hyeol Seung?\u201d\u201cHyeol Seung has to do something else. Don\u2019t complain too much, and move with Oh Yuk-pyo.\u201d\u201cShit! Okay.\u201dIt was impossible for the members of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group to disobey Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s orders.No matter how selfish she was, Heo Ran-ju could not disobey Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s public order.Zhang Mu-ryang, who gave each one a task, smiled and said,\u201cNothing happened while you\u2019re on the way here, right? Has anyone seen any unusual trends or people who could be a variable?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know about the variables, but I\u2019ve seen an unusual guy.\u201d\u201cWho is that?\u201dAt the words of Go Dosa, Zhang Mu-ryang showed curiosity.\u201cThere was a man named Pyo-wol who looked even prettier than Ranju.\u201d\u201cHo! Was there such a person?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a guy who didn\u2019t fall for the seduction of Ranju.\u201d\u201cHong! What do you mean? I was deliberately being less seductive.\u201dHeo Ran-ju intervened in the middle, but Go Dosa ignored it and continued,\u201cAnyway, he had a very striking appearance, and his martial arts look pretty strong.\u201d\u201cHave you ever seen him perform martial arts?\u201d\u201cNot really, but there was no change in his expression when he saw Hyeol Seung in action. Seeing Hyeol Seung run wild on a rural place, anyone would turn their heads away but he looked at him insensitively as if he was looking at a stone rolling on the floor. If he\u2019s not a martial artist, then he\u2019ll never have those kinds of eyes.\u201d\u201cHmm! Have you figured out his background?\u201d\u201cNo! Ranju stuck to him like glue and flirted with him, but she still couldn\u2019t figure out anything.\u201d\u201cHe seems hard to crack. Ranju\u2019s temperament might be dogshit, but with her looks alone, anyone can be tempted.\u201d\u201cHey! What do you mean by dogshit?\u201dHeo Ran-ju protested, but Zhang Mu-ryang and Go Dosa ignored her and continued their conversation.\u201cDid he also come to Chengdu\u201d\u201cHe will come in today or tomorrow.\u201d\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll see and judge him for myself later.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dGo Dosa laughed.He completely trusted Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s abilities. It was entirely the work of Zhang Mu-ryang that the Black Cloud Mercenary Group could grow and maintain their influence this much.At that time, Oh Yuk-pyo opened his mouth.\u201cIs the boy really pretty?\u201dHis eyes were already red and bloodshot. No one in their group would not know what it meant.\u00a0 Heo Ran-ju got up from her seat.\u201cYou crazy bastard! I saw him first!\u201d\u201cHehehe! Whoever gets him first.\u201d\u201cYou want to try it?\u201d\u201cWhat can\u2019t you do?\u201dOh Yuk-pyo also got up from his seat and looked at Heo Ran-ju. At the untimely confrontation between the two, Go Dosa and Hyeol Seung sighed. But they didn\u2019t look too worried.Zhang Mu-ryang asked Go Dosa.\u201cWhat did you say his name was?\u201d\u201cI told you, it\u2019s Pyo-wol.\u201d* * *By the time the sun rose, Pyo-wol came down to the first floor of the guest house. The Gujin Pyo-guk had already departed, so the inside of the guest house was empty.When Pyo-wol appeared, the owner of the guest house was extremely nervous. The uproar last night was because of Pyo-wol.The head of Gujin Pyo-guk, who lost his face, had a soulless expression.\u00a0One of their members became a blind person, while the rest of the members were also injured, both large and small, that left them unable to act out and do missions for some time.\u00a0The only reason why he didn\u2019t rush to get his revenge was because he knew how to grasp the overall situation. Even though the strongest members of the Gujin Pyo-guk united and rushed, they still ended up in that shape.\u00a0The fact that he would receive even more damage if he rushed to get revenge made him restrain himself. Furthermore, the members of the Gujin Pyo-guk were also against the idea. So even if he wanted to, he couldn\u2019t do anything.\u00a0So, he gave up on revenge and left with the rest of the members. Jang Woo-rak couldn\u2019t do anything about it, but it was best to take the rest of the members to the doctor as soon as possible to treat their wounds.Pyo-wol approached the owner of the guest house.\u201cI, I\u2013!\u201dThe owner of the guest house looked at Pyo-wol with a look of terror. The fear he felt was immense, as he had seen firsthand the cruel nature that lies behind his beautiful appearance.Pyo-wol asked the owner of the guest house.\u201cWho is the person who knows the most about the situation inside of Sichuan here?\u201d\u201cWhat kind of information?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about the situation among the sects.\u201d\u201cAh! Then, please visit workshop1\u00a0street.\u201d\u201cA workshop street?\u201d\u201cAfter leaving the guest house, go straight to the left and you will see workshop street. There is a sign board which says Fire Dragon Building2\u00a0at the innermost part of workshop\u00a0 street, so you can go there.\u201d\u201cFire Dragon Building?\u201d\u201cIt is a clan made by the craftsmen from Sichuan Province long ago. They have been doing business with sect members in Sichuan for a long time, so no one knows the inner situation better than them. If you buy a suitable weapon and ask them a question, they will answer well.\u201dPyo-wol walked to the workshop\u00a0 street as the owner of the guest house had told him.Kkangkkang!It was early in the morning, but the street was noisy with the sound of hammers coming from the workshops.It was the first time in his life that he had seen such a sight, so Pyo-wol stood in the middle of the street and listened to the sound of hammering.The sound of hammering coming from some of the workshops were dull, while in others the sound was too light. Countless noises were mixed, but Pyo-wol\u2019s sensitive hearing was able to discern all the sounds one by one.Bang! Bang!Among them, there was a place where there was a particularly clear metal sound.Pyo-wol looked around in search of the source of the sound. It didn\u2019t take long before he was able to find the place where the clear metal sound was flowing.It was the Fire Dragon Building.Pyo-wol soon entered the Fire Dragon Building.\u00a0As soon as he opened the door and walked in, he could feel the heat. The heat emanating from the furnace is filling the inside of the room.In front of the brazier, a young man in his early twenties was pounding a hot iron metal.\u00a0 He was concentrating on hammering, unaware that Pyo-wol had arrived. Pyo-wol looked at the man with his arms crossed.Kang! Kang!The man\u2019s hammering was heavy. Each time he struck the iron, it changed shape.That was then.Inside the workshop, a man with a goatee opened the door and came out. He saw a young man hammering, turned his eyes, and rushed in.\u201cHey, you bastard! What are you doing? Who told you to hold the hammer as you please?\u201dHe just kicked the young man. The young man fell to the floor without even screaming.\u201cYou bastard! I told you. Never hold a hammer in the workshop. Just go and do the errands.\u201dHe trampled the young man mercilessly. But the young man endured the violence without screaming. The young man\u2019s eyes, covering his head with both hands, were full of poison.\u201cHyuk-huh! You damn bastard! Still not saying you\u2019re in the wrong.\u201dIn the end, the man with the goatee was the first one to get exhausted. At that moment, the young man ripped off his clothes and stood up.\u201cYou are banned from entering this place for the time being. You\u2019re doing chores inside until I call you again.\u201dThe young man nodded at the man with the goatee and went inside.\u201cThat burns! What did I do to get such a bastard\u2013 Huh?\u201dThe man with the goatee, who was cursing the young man, noticed that there was another person in the workshop.\u201cHehe! I didn\u2019t even know that a customer was here, so I showed an ugly sight. What did you come here to buy?\u201d\u201cWhat did he do wrong?\u201d\u201cThat? Oh, you\u2019re talking about Sochu.\u201d\u201cSochu?\u201d\u201cYeah! His name is Tang Sochu. I heard that he was a descendant of the Tang family, but he keeps on trying to grab the hammer without permission.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t the descendants of the Tang family hold the hammer?\u201d\u201cYou seem to be new to Sichuan?\u201d\u201cIn a way.\u201d\u201cThen, that explains it. Did you know why the Tang family was destroyed? Isn\u2019t it because they were on the side of the demon sect in the old days? Because of that, they were sealed off by the first person of all time and age, and after that, the three rapidly shrunk and collapsed? The Tang family of Sichuan was a traitor who betrayed Jianghu. After that, no workshop has passed on the secret to the people associated with the Tang family. They are afraid that the same situation in the past will happen again.\u201dEven using the surname of the Tang family without any relation to the party was penalized. The existence of the Fire Dragon Building itself would be in jeopardy if they teach a person who was rumored to be a descendant of the Tang family.But it was not known whether Tang Sochu was really the descendant of the Tang family.\u00a0This was because it has already been over two hundred years since the Tang family went extinct. There was no guarantee that the bloodline of that time still remained, and even if it did, there was no way to trace and reveal his personal history.The goatee man was Buntaju5.\u00a0It was only in anger that he trampled on Tang Sochu.\u00a0He went to a gambling house last night and lost a lot of money. He released his anger on Tang Sochu. In Sichuan Province, there was still a perception that the descendants of the Tang Dynasty could still be alive.\u201cThe descendants live with the original sins of their ancestors long ago.\u201d\u201cWho told them to stand on the side of the demon sect? It\u2019s the price that the Tang family chose for themselves. Oh, but what were you interested in buying this morning?\u201d\u201cA small dagger.4\u201c\u201cHic! If it\u2019s a small dagger, it must be for throwing. Please follow me. All the weapons made in the workshop are on display inside.\u201d \u2018Buntaju was a very talkative person. He spoke non stop as he made his way to the display of weapons.\u201cMany clans from Sichuan province order weapons from our Fire Dragon Building. Among them, my work is famous for its high quality. You probably won\u2019t regret it.\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t it look like there are a lot of orders these days?\u201d\u201cHehe! The amount of orders has doubled since the Emei sect and Qingcheng sect started fighting in earnest. The atmosphere in Sichuan Province has become ferocious, but on the contrary, we are enjoying the booming business. Even now, all the craftsmen in the workshop are crazy about making weapons ordered from each door.\u201dBuntaju continued to chatter and talked about how great this place is.Pyo-wol listened attentively to his words.Buntaju was proud of his work, and his words contained enough information about the situation of Jianghu in Sichuan.Which among the sects are associated with the Emei sect, and which sects support the Qingcheng sect.All of this were the information that Pyo-wol wanted.\u201cAll kinds of throwing knives are here. Pick one.\u201dThere were different kinds of throwing knives placed on the shelves pointed to by the Buntaju. Pyo-wol looked closely at all the weapons. But there was nothing he really liked.In fact, he didn\u2019t need the weapons. Buying a throwing knife was just a ceremonial act to get information from the Fire Dragon Building.Pyo-wol bought two of the most well-made throwing knives and went out.Perhaps because of the name of the Fire Dragon Building, the throwing knife was very expensive. However, Pyo-wol, who did not know the price of weapons, paid the amount he wanted.After Pyo-wol went out, Buntaju liked that he caught a pushover.\u201cBut for a pushover, he\u2019s really handsome. I want to live with a face like that for just one day.\u201dDon\u2019t forget to comment down below and let me know what you think of the chapter~ \u2661Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 49": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 49Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter leaving the store, Pyo-wol\u2019s gaze turned to the next alley.\u201cWho told you to go use the hammer?\u201d\u201cAre you crazy? How dare you grab a hammer that we\u2019ve never held before?\u201dSome men were trampling on someone.It was the Tang Sochu who he saw in the workshop.\u00a0He was being ruthlessly beaten with his back bent like a shrimp. The people trampling on Tang Sochu were the apprentices who were learning blacksmith work in the Fire Dragon Building.Fire Dragon Building was basically a clan made by artisans. The ark is operated, but the authority of the Fire Dragon Building comes from the craftsmen.That\u2019s why it was important to be an apprentice of a particular master artisan. Buntaju was a very good craftsman in the Fire Dragon Building, and there were countless apprentices who wanted to be taught by him.However, in order to become a formal apprentice, a lot of waiting was required, and in the meantime, it was an implicit rule to have to do chores.Tang Sochu broke that rule and grabbed the hammer.In a way, it was natural for the apprentices to be angry with Tang Sochu.\u201cThis is for having such dirty blood of the Tang family.\u201d\u201cThis is for breaking the rules every now and then.\u201dThe apprentices spit out curse words and used violence. Even though Tang Sochu was beaten like that, he did not scream once. His eyes remained ull of poison, and his lips were clenched. His flesh was torn or burst and blood was flowing red, but his eyes never softened.Pyo-wol looked carefully at the face of Tang Sochu.\u00a0As time passed, the violence of the apprentices became more severe. However, Tang Sochu gritted his teeth even more and persevered.Pyo-wol liked the poisonous eyes of Tang Sochu.Because he himself survived with such an attitude.Tang Sochu\u2019s eyes turned to Pyo-wol as he felt his gaze.Their eyes met in the air.Pyo-wol\u2019s eyes, as if the flow of time had stopped, and Tang So-chu\u2019s eyes, which seemed empty but full of poison, were somehow similar.Thunk!Pyo-wol threw the throwing knife which he just bought from Buntaju, towards Tang Sochu.The throwing knife fell right in front of Tang Sochu\u2019s hand.Pyo-wol replied to Tang Sochu\u2019s eyes who had a questioning gaze, as if asking about the meaning of Pyo-wol\u2019s action.\u201cHuman beings are more ferocious than beasts. Once you look down on them, they will bite until they die. Their beating will not end if you put up with it like this. Don\u2019t endure\u00a0 it. If it becomes your habit to endure the pain and beatings, you will continue living like a wretched dog.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWhen?\u201dIt was only then that the apprentices realized that someone was standing in the alley. They had a puzzled expression.This kind of violence was usually done in secret. There was nothing good about going outside. The oldest of the apprentices said with a fierce expression.\u201cHey, customer! Don\u2019t talk nonsense and just go. This matter only concerns our Fire Dragon Building.\u201dHis voice was polite, but the meaning of his words wasn\u2019t. The very mention of the Fire Dragon Building was used to pressure Pyo-wol.In fact, the prestige of the Fire Dragon Building in Sichuan was great.Although the force itself is declining, many sects in Sichuan Province were connected with them as they are the only clan that can supply high-quality weapons in large quantities.For that reason, some problems were resolved by using the name of the Fire Dragon Building.\u00a0The apprentices were also aiming for that so they used the name Fire Dragon Building. However, Pyo-wol was neither intimidated nor scared by the name of the Fire Dragon Building.\u00a0He already experienced too much to be terrified of such a threat.Pyo-wol didn\u2019t even look at the apprentices, but only looked at Tang Sochu. Such an attitude of Pyo-wol further fueled the anger of the apprentices.\u201cGo before\u2014\u201dIt was a moment when the atmosphere of the apprentices became even more sinister.\u201cKeuk!\u201dSuddenly one of the apprentices screamed.The other apprentices flinched and quickly turned around. They saw Tang Sochu biting the shoulder of the apprentice who had been screaming.With how deeply he bit, an enormous amount of fresh blood flowed from the apprentice\u2019s shoulder, staining Sochu\u2019s face and chest red.\u201cYou crazy bastard!\u201d\u201cCome on, let go!\u201dThe apprentices were frightened and tried to get rid of Tang Sochu\u2019s head from the apprentice. However, when Tang Sochu threatened to wield a dagger, they could not approach him ahead of time.\u201cKeekkeuck!\u201dHaving his shoulder bitten, the apprentice struggled with pain.Just before he lost his breath, Tang Sochu released the shoulder tha he had bitten.\u201cYou crazy bastard\u2013\u201d\u201cAre you crazy? How can you bite a person like a beast?\u201dThe apprentices supported their bloody comrade and stared at Tang Sochu. Despite their accusations, Tang Sochu did not care.\u201cWhen did you guys treat me like a human? You treated me like an animal.\u201d\u201cDo you think you\u2019ll be safe after this?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, now I\u2019m tired of being beaten by you guys for no reason. I\u2019m going to attack any bastard who abuses me again.\u201dTang Sochu threw his dagger at the apprentices. Then the apprentice\u2019s eyes shook.There seemed to be naturalization in the eyes of Tang.Those bloody eyes made the apprentices feel weak.Even rats bite when they\u2019re cornered, and that\u2019s exactly what Tang Sochu did. The only difference is that the rat has only a small fang, but Tang Sochu has a dagger in his hand.\u00a0It is also a dagger that has been forged in a blue color.\u201cDamn! You, you! Just wait and see!\u201d\u201cCrazy bastard!\u201dThe apprentices eventually withdrew with the injured apprentice. When they all disappeared, only then did Tang Sochu spit.\u201cKaak! Heek!\u201dBlood was mixed in with his saliva. His internal organs were very badly damaged.\u201cShit!\u201dPyo-wol supported the body of Tang Sochu when he fell, and asked,\u201cHouse?\u201d\u201cNo! Take me to the dormitory inside the workshop.\u201dPyo-wol took Tang Sochu to the place he was talking about.Tang Sochu\u2019s accommodation was so poor that he could only escape the rain and wind. Even a pigsty couldn\u2019t be any worse than this. Inside the room, there was only a single, shabby lump of paper.Pyo-wol looked into the room and murmured.\u201cIt\u2019s nice.\u201d\u201cYou like this? Are you crazy?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like an avenger palace. I lived in a place infested with snakes.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to lie. Do you think I will be comforted if you say that?\u201d\u201cDo you see me as a person who can comfort others?\u201d\u201cNot really.\u201dTang Sochu said. It didn\u2019t seem like a person with emotionless eyes like Pyo-wol could comfort others by telling lies.\u2018Then is it true that he really lived in a snake pit?\u2019Tang Sochu let out a sigh of relief. It was because he instinctively felt that Pyo-wol\u2019s words were true. Pyo-wol got up from his seat.Tang Sochu asked.\u201cWhere are you leaving?\u201d\u201cI have a place to go.\u201d\u201cWhere?\u201d\u201cAre you really that interested in other people\u2019s affairs?\u201cDidn\u2019t you also meddle in the affairs of a stranger?\u201d\u201cI guess so.\u201dPyo-wol looked at Tang Sochu. A face resembling himself was staring straight at him.\u201cI\u2019ve been there before. Thoroughly exploited, abandoned and chased.\u201d\u201cSo you want to get revenge?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cYour opponent seems to be quite easy-going. Seeing that you can even try to get your revenge.\u201d\u201cNot really. They\u2019re pretty strong.\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s your opponent?\u201d\u201cThe Emei sect and Qingcheng sect, and all the other sects that follow them.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you crazy?! Are you going to declare war against the entire forces of Sichuan?\u201dTang Sochu raised his voice. It was a look of real excitement.\u00a0Pyo-wol shrugged.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s crazy. But that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m crazy.\u201d\u201cThen are you really going to try it?\u201d\u201cI have no reason to lie to you.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re really crazy.\u201d\u201cNow give me back the dagger. I bought it because I needed it.\u201d\u201cThis trash?\u201dTang Sochu looked at the dagger he was holding in his hand.\u201cThe trash is worth a coin. Heh heh! If you rush to get revenge on something like this, it\u2019ll break quickly. Just throw this garbage away.\u201dTang Sochu threw the dagger away and searched in the far corner of his room. He showed up after a while with a leather belt in his hand.\u201cTake it!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll know when you try it.\u201dPyo-wol took the leather belt and examined it. On the outside, it was just a simple belt, but looking inside, there\u2019s a bag with dozens of throwing knives stored in it.Pyo-wol took out throwing knives and examined them closely.The sharpened blade was perfect for both balance and strength. A small ring was attached to the end of the handle of the throwing knife, so that something like a string could be connected.It was such an excellent item that Pyo-wol immediately understood what Tang Sochu\u2019s words meant when he said that the dagger he bought in Bunta was garbage.\u00a0\u201cDid you make it yourself?\u201d\u201cWho else would make them? Of course, I made them all myself.\u201d\u201cIt must have been hard.\u201d\u201cHard? It was only hard because I didn\u2019t have the time to make it secretly, but the process of making it myself wasn\u2019t hard at all.\u201dThere was a sense of pride in Tang Sochu\u2019s voice.\u201cCan you give me this?\u201d\u201cYou say you\u2019re going to take revenge on the Qingcheng and Emei sect, right?\u201d\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cThe reason the Tang family collapsed was because of them, of course, it doesn\u2019t mean that the Tang family was good. In any case, it is wrong to stand on the side of the demon sect and betray Jianghu. However, I cannot forgive the fact that they pressured the Tang family in every way and caused them to fall apart.\u201dTang Sochu inherited the Tang family\u2019s spirit and resentment.\u00a0\u201cSo, you want revenge with this weapon?\u201d\u201cIf my weapons can taste their blood, then it\u2019s enough.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a difficult request, but how can you believe in me and give me such a piece of equipment? This can make me a lot of money if I sell it in the market.\u201d\u201cMoney is not important to me.\u201dHis voice was full of resentment.Just because he inherited the Tang surname, the hardships he suffered were indescribable.The Fire Dragon Building didn\u2019t fully come into his side either. It was unavoidable because of the pressures of the sects.The Fire Dragon Building was extremely afraid of the rebirth of the Tang family. So, they are trying to keep a close watch on Tang Sochu, who has inherited the Tang surname.If he was a disciple, they would have allowed him to hold a hammer, but because he was just an apprentice, they didn\u2019t pass on their skills.\u00a0Because of that, Tang Sochu learned secretly at night, and today this incident happened.\u201cEveryone told me to endure. You\u2019re the first one to tell me not to.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know your circumstances, but your eyes must have impressed me quite a bit.\u201d\u201cSometimes a dog whistle is sweeter than a cowardice.\u201d (\u201c\uc5b4\ub5a4 \ub54c\ub294 \uac1c\uc18c\ub9ac\uac00 \uac10\uc5b8\uc774\uc124\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub2ec\ucf64\ud55c \ubc95\uc774\uac70\ub4e0.\u201d)\u201cOkay, I will use this.\u201dPyo-yeo loosened the existing belt and wore the leather belt made by Tang Sochu on his waist. It was so luxurious that no one would even think that there were weapons in it.Pyo-wol moved his hand and picked up the stored throwing knife.\u00a0The weapon came out without a sound.Pyo-wol repeated the act of inserting and removing the dagger\u00a0 several times.Tang Sochu couldn\u2019t hide his surprised expression at the speed of Pyo-wol\u2019s actions. It was because his eyes could not even grasp Pyo-wol\u2019s hand movements. It was as if the weapon was moving on its own.\u2018My eyes weren\u2019t wrong. He\u2019s the owner of my weapons.\u201d\u2019He did not know Pyo-wol\u2019s name or identity. But he was convinced that he was the owner of the things he had made.\u201cOh, come to think of it, I don\u2019t even know your name.\u201d\u201cPyo-wol. That\u2019s my name.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll remember it.\u201d\u201cWhenever you hear the name, Ghost knife1, you should think of the weapons you created.\u201d\u201cGhost knife?\u201d\u201cIf such a good weapon doesn\u2019t have a name, it would be a waste.\u201d\u201cGhost knife\u2026 Good!\u201dTang Sochu smiled for the first time. It was a name that suited the object he had worked hard to create.\u201cThen take good care of yourself.\u201d\u201cMy name is Tang Sochu. If the Ghost Knife breaks down, come to me anytime. I\u2019ll fix it for you.\u201d\u201cI will.\u201dPyo-wol tucked the Ghost knife into his belt and went outside.Sochu, who was left alone, muttered as he watched Pyo-wol disappear through the door.\u201cPyo-wol! I\u2019m praying that his name will spread throughout Sichuan Province.\u201dThe more the name Pyo-wol is heard, the more likely the Emei and Qingcheng sect will decline.He did not really believe that a single person could really do anything to the two major powers of Sichuan, the Qingcheng and the Emei sect.\u00a0He\u2019s just looking forward to it.In order to relieve his resentment a little by inflicting a certain amount of damage.Don\u2019t forget to comment down below and let me know what you think of the chapter~ \u2661Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 50": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 50Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayPyo-wol really liked the ghost knife.It was nice to have the weapon completely hidden inside his belt. Furthermore, from the beginning, it seemed like that the ghost knife fits well around his hand.A small ghost knife was spinning on the palm of Pyo-wol. Just by moving the muscles in the palm of his hand, he can control the ghost knife at will.One of the most important things to the assassin was the sensation of his bare hands.Pyo-wol\u2019s hand sense was very delicate. So he was able to freely use any of his muscles as long as he set his mind on it.As time passed, he became more proficient in using the throwing knife, and by the time the sun went down, the weapon could twirl freely on Pyo-wol\u2019s hand like a living creature.As he spent time playing with the throwing knife like a toy, Pyo-wol suddenly thought of how to connect it with his Suhonsa.If it can be used by connecting Suhonsa at the end of the knife, its use will be endless.\u2018Is it possible?\u2019The biggest advantage of Pyo-wol is that he has no hesitation. If there is something that comes to mind, he could execute it immediately to satisfy his curiosity.\u00a0\u00a0For him, there were no side effects or backlash from experiencing failure.If he fails, he can try again, and he can endure the side effects.Pyo-wol has lived like that until now, so he took on another challenge again.His disposition did not change just because he went out.Pyo-wol operated Suhonsa.An invisible thread of qi came out at the tip of his index finger. Pyo-wol moved Suhonsa to grab the ring of the ghost knife.\u00a0At first, it seemed that the Suhonsa could carry the weight of the ghost knife. However, as soon as he moved it a little, Suhonsa could not bear the weight of the ghost knife and broke off.For a moment, Pyo-wol felt his inner qi flowing backwards. A recoil occurred when the Suhonsa was cut off.Pyo-wol once again controls his inner qi and tries to attach the Suhonsa to the ghost knife.\u00a0The ghost knife hanging from the Suhonsa swayed precariously.The moment Pyo-wol moved his fingers, the Suhonsa ceased again. With that reaction, Pyo-wol\u2019s complexion turned pure white.If it were an ordinary person, they would have given up at this point. This was because, if their internal qi experiences a repulsion, they may get caught in a painful backlash.\u00a0However, Pyo-wol\u2019s body was different from that of ordinary warriors.His blood veins were as flexible and tough as snakes, and they stood firm against any shock. Even if he felt the pain, he can endure the runaway of the inner qi to some extent.Pyo-wol also knew that fact, so he was able to take on the challenge despite the continued failures.While walking on the road, Pyo-wol did not stop practicing.At first, it was difficult to maintain a single angle. However, as the number of his trials increased, the length of time Pyo-wol maintained the connection with the ghost knife increased.The ghost knife connected to Suhonsa moved back and forth like a pendulum hung on a string.It\u2019s still dangerous, but the Suhonsa could now bear the weight of the ghost knife.\u00a0It was then that Pyo-wol collected the Suhonsa and ghost knife.There was a hint of fatigue on his face, but a satisfied smile appeared on his lips.Now that he has learned to some extent how to deal with the ghost knife through practice, all that remains is to get used to it through constant training.It is daunting to deal with just one ghost at the moment, but later, when his realm deepens, he will be able to handle all ten ghost knives with his ten fingers.\u00a0Pyo-wol suddenly raised his head and looked around.A large city could be seen in the distance.He came here while training using the ghost knife, and he was getting closer to Chengdu.\u00a0Chengdu was incomparable to any other city Pyo-wol had ever seen. It was enough for him to be overwhelmed by its size just by looking at it.Pyo-wol paused for a moment and looked at Chengdu.Numerous thoughts ran through his mind. However, Pyo-wol shook his head and threw away all useless thoughts.From now on, every moment matters.A single negligence could cost his life, so Pyo-wol once again strengthened his resolve.After calming down to a certain extent, Pyo-wol moved towards Chengdu. Chengdu was bigger and more splendid than it looked from the outside.The road was wide enough to allow several large carriages to pass at the same time, and the huge pavilions continued endlessly. People of all kinds were filling the streets, and they were overflowing with vitality.However, there was a sense of tension in the faces of the people passing by on the street. There were a few warriors in possession of weapons.The confrontation between the Qingcheng sect and Emei sect is also affecting Chengdu.\u00a0Pyo-wol set out to find a guest house.\u00a0As it is the largest city in Sichuan Province, there were many large guest houses in Chengdu. Among them, Pyo-wol entered the guest house which is a place that was visited by many people.\u201cHuyuu!\u201dAs soon as he entered the guest house, the people\u2019s attention was focused on him at once.\u00a0It was because Pyo-wol\u2019s appearance stood out.Pyo-wol didn\u2019t blush and simply found an empty seat. He already experienced receiving those kinds of looks and reactions countless times on the way to this place.As he sat down, a warm-looking middle-aged woman approached with a tray.\u201cHo-Hong! Welcome, guest!\u201dShe was the hostess of the guest house.\u00a0Usually, it was usually a waiter or servant who greeted the guests. However, due to Pyo-wol\u2019s outstanding appearance, the hostess ran over and beat the servant to it.\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Oh my gosh! How can a man be so handsome! I\u2019ve been running this guest house for twenty years, but this is the first time I\u2019ve seen such a handsome man.\u2019The hostess looked at Pyo-wol with a look as if possessed.\u201cHo Hong! Are you just going to eat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to stay for a few days. Is there any room?\u201d\u201cOf course. We have a very spacious and clean room. The other guests need five coins, but you only pay three coins. Ho-Hong!\u201dA blush appeared on the hostess\u2019s face. If it was a handsome man like this, it wouldn\u2019t matter if she didn\u2019t get the extra two coins.\u201cThen I\u2019m going to eat and stay.\u201d\u201cYou thought well. No matter where you go in Chengdu, there is no place that is cleaner and has better food than ours.\u201d\u201cOkay, I hope you can give me some tasty food.\u201d\u201cAiku! Look at my spirit. What kind of joke is this for a customer who has come a long way. If you wait a little bit, I\u2019ll bring you some food. Ho-hong!\u201dThe hostess went back to the kitchen, shaking her buttocks.\u00a0The guests who saw the scene spoke,\u00a0\u201cHuh! I\u2019ve been coming here for a long time, but it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen the hostess have such a bright expression on her face.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s so handsome, so damn good-looking. Even if I\u2019m a girl, I think I\u2019ll untie my skirt.\u201d\u201cIf I could live just one day with a face like that, I would have no wish.\u201dPyo-wol listened to them with one ear and let it out through the other. It was because he got used to it many times while coming here. Pyo-wol looked out the window with an indifferent expression.Red lanterns were lit up one by one on the street as the sun went down. The street dyed with fire was colorful and beautiful.At that time, the voice of the hostess of the guesthouse broke Pyo-wol\u2019s thoughts.\u201cHo-Hong! I\u2019m sorry to keep you waiting so long. I\u2019ve mastered cooking, but now the food has arrived. Enjoy your meal, and if you need anything, please call me anytime.\u201dThe hostess put down the food and smiled at Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol nodded his head without saying a word. As if regretful, the hostess looked at Pyo-wol\u2019s face once more and returned to her original position.Then Pyo-wol picked up his chopsticks and tasted the food little by little.The stir-fried pork, rice, and a few side dishes were all it took, but they were all delicious because of their good cooking skills.In fact, for Pyo-wol, everything he ate outside was delicious. No matter what kind of food he ate, it was bound to taste better than moss or snakes.Pyo-wol chewed the food tightly. Not even a single side dish was lightly chewed.That was then.\u201cIt\u2019s Seonha.\u201d\u201cQingming Room\u2019s1\u00a0Go Seong-ak is also with her.\u201d\u201cThen, is today the day of the Blue Moon meeting?2\u201cThe voices of people shouting came from outside.The murmur grew louder and louder, eventually leading to a guest house where Pyo-wol ate.When Pyo-wol raised his head with a slight frown on his forehead, three men were entering the guest house in the form of escorting one woman.All the men were young.They all looked different, but it was clear that they all had a good body and had a strong physique.Their eyes were all on the woman walking in the middle.The woman was like a gorgeous rose.She wore a beautiful dress made of heavenly silk with colorful ornaments on her neatly curled up hair. But what stood out most was her snow-white skin and beautiful features.The woman resembled a red rose.The people in the guest house lost their minds and looked at the woman.\u201cSeonha, can obviously be said to have the most beautiful appearance comparable to that of the Yong Seol-ran from the main mountain of the Emei sect.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m guessing that\u2019s why the Young Master of Qingming Room lost his mind and followed her.\u201dSeonha lowered her eyes slightly and moved forward. Because of this, an unusually white neck was exposed above the collar. It was so alluring that people couldn\u2019t take their eyes off it.After entering the guest house, all she did was just walk gently. However, with that simple act, she completely took control of the atmosphere in the guest house.Seonha lifted her head slightly and looked around the inside of the house.A soft smile appeared on her lips, confirming that everyone\u2019s attention was focused on her.She had to get everyone\u2019s attention like this before her job was released. She hasn\u2019t seen anyone other than herself getting attention.Go Seong-ak and the other two people in Qingming Room who came with her were also mentioned as nae-ro in Chengdu. They always followed and courted her.Although Seonha did not directly set up the group, her followers naturally gathered and formed a group called Blue Moon.Today was the meeting day of the Blue Moon. For the meeting, the Blue Moon borrowed the entire floor of the guest house.It cost a lot of money to rent the whole floor as it is a very well-run business, but it was no problem for Go Seong-ak and others who were blinded by Seonha.They were willing to pay a huge sum.It was to get closer to Seonha even a little more.\u2018If I can marry her, I will sell my soul.\u2019\u2018She\u2019s really beautiful. How can a human be so beautiful? Whoever gets her can be said to be the luckiest person in the world.\u201dGo Seong-ak and the others looked at Seonha, lost in their hearts. However, Seonha\u2019s eyes were focused on someone else.It was towards the beautiful man sitting by the window.Even though he was a man, he was more beautiful than a woman and had a strange atmosphere that could not be expressed in words.The moment she saw Pyo-wol, she felt a chill in her spine. She couldn\u2019t hide the bewildered expression that took precedence over the unfamiliar emotions. It was the first time she felt such an emotion in her life.However, Pyo-wol was only eating food as if he had no interest in her.Seonha was lost in the middle of her thoughts. Then Go Seong-ak asked with a worried expression.\u201cAre you okay? Do you feel anything?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. It was because I was dizzy for a while.\u201d\u201cThen shall we cancel today\u2019s meeting?\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019m fine now. Thank you, Go Song-ak! You\u2019re always taking good\u00a0 care of me.\u201d\u201cNo. I just want Seonha to always be alright.\u201d\u201cI am always grateful for the consideration of Go Song-ak.\u201dSeongha smiled at Go Seong-ak. Then, Go Seong-ak put on an ecstatic expression, and the crew members around him stared at him with jealous eyes.Those who followed Seonha gathered together and named it Blue Moon, but in reality they were nothing but competitors.If any of them wins the competition and takes priority, the Blue Moon will be disbanded on that day.Knowing that fact, she did not give her heart to anyone who took precedence, and she exquisitely walked the tightrope and burned the troubles of the crew.With a nonchalant look on her face, she took a step back. However, Go Seong-ak was already staring at the place Seongha had been looking at a while ago.Although it was momentary, he realized that Seonha was looking at Pyo-wol.A glimmer of envy flashed in his eyes.Pyo-wol didn\u2019t do anything, but just because Seon-ha gave him his gaze, he got angry from the bottom of his heart.What made him angry more than anything else was Pyo-wol\u2019s appearance. Even with their similar gender, his handsome face stimulated his inferiority complex.\u2018I\u2019ll see him later.\u2019His poisonous eyes were shot at Pyo-wol like a dagger.The first to notice this were the people near Pyo-wol.People hurriedly turned their heads to avoid Go Seong-ak\u2019s eyes.Qingming Room, where Go Seong-ak is the young master, was based on the outskirts of the city as one of the four rooms.3\u00a0For that reason, his influence in Chengdu was greater than that of the Emei and Qingcheng sects.\u00a0It was virtually impossible to stay away from the eyes of Go Seong-ak in Chengdu.When Go Seong-ak followed Seonha up to the next floor, some people looked at Pyo-wol with regretful expressions.Among them, a middle-aged man who looked a little older spoke to Pyo-wol.\u201cHey, if you don\u2019t live here, you better leave the city as soon as possible. It\u2019s all because I\u2019m worried about you, so get out of here before the night is over. That\u2019s the only way for you to live.\u201d\u201cWhy should I do that?\u201d\u201cHuh! I guess you\u2019re not really from here. Seeing that you don\u2019t know anything about the Young Master Go Seong-ak.\u201d\u201cWho is he?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s the fire lord of the Qingming Room. He\u2019s easily jealous, so he\u2019ll never allow the Seonha to stare at other men.\u201d\u201cI have no interest in her.\u201d\u201cYour interest is not very important. First of all, the fact that the Seonha has given you her attention is important. Go Seok-ah wants the Seonha to see only him. He does not let anything get in the way.\u201d\u201cThat woman is a pretty great person, right?\u201d\u201cHuh! Do you mean you don\u2019t know the Poisonous Wasp,4\u00a0Woo Seonha? She\u2019s the fire lord of the White Flower Room5\u00a0which is made up of women. The White Flower Room is no different from the Emei sect\u2019s sub-family clan. So how could she not be great?\u201d\u201cDid you just say the Emei sect?\u201d\u201cYeah! The White Flower Room is a follower of the Emei sect. Seonha is a very prized person in the Emei.\u201dA white smile appeared on Pyo-wol\u2019s lips.\u201cThat\u2019s interesting.\u201dDon\u2019t forget to comment down below and let me know what you think of the chapter~ \u2661Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 51": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 51Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMore than twenty members gathered at the meeting of the Blue Moon Association. All of them were disciples of famous sects in Sichuan Province.\u00a0Many of the men gathered in that place to admire and look at Seonha\u2019s beauty. Seonha was a flower that many bees wanted. But she didn\u2019t want to end up being just a flower.\u2018I am not a flower waiting for a bee to fly. I will become the queen bee and put them all under my control.\u2019That was how the nickname Poisonous Bee was born.Although she did not reveal her overriding ambition, the people gathering around her saw through her acts and thus gave her the name Poisonous Bee.A queen bee harboring poison.That was how the public saw her.There was only one reason why Seonha\u00a0 stayed in the Blue Moon.It was just to help the Emei sect.To be precise, it was to set a big ball for the Emei sect.\u00a0The White Flower Room is a subsidiary sect of the Emei sect. This also means that they share the same destiny with the Emei sect.\u00a0The White Flower Room was working hard to help the Emei sect. It was also because of that reason that Woo Seonha tolerated the Blue Moon party, which was made up of men who followed her around.All of the men in the Blue Moon were people who could be called the chiefs of Sichuan. Naturally, their influence was not small. So this would be a great help to Emei. Their influence in Chengdu keeps them from falling behind the Qingcheng sect.Even in the Emei sect, she was recognized for her work and was treated like a main disciple. But she never intended to be this satisfied with just this much.\u2018I will surely become the master of the Emei sect and command the entire Sichuan City.\u2019There were several barriers to overcome to do so. However, Woo Seonha was willing and ready to do anything to get over those barriers.\u00a0Seonha thoroughly concealed her feelings and looked at the members of the Blue Moon party with a smile.\u201cI sincerely thank all of you who answered the call of such a humble woman.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s Woo Seonha\u2019s call, of course, we would have come running.\u201d\u201cWhere are we?\u201d\u201cWe are ready to join the Woo Seonha at any time.\u201dAt the men\u2019s replies, Seonha\u2019s smile grew brighter. Again, the men were mesmerized by the sight. She was well aware that her appearance was very beautiful. She also knew how to use it to her advantage and attract men more easily.Sueuk!Seonha gently crossed her legs, revealing her white calves. The men were easily distracted as they tried to steal a glimpse at her exposed skin.She wanted to laugh at those men.\u00a0\u2018Heh! All men are the same. They are all snobs.\u2019However, she hid her true thoughts thoroughly and continued to speak.\u201cThe situation of the White Flower Room is not very good due to the pressure of the Qingcheng sect, but there is now room to breathe. Thank you very much.\u201d\u201cNo matter how strong the Qingcheng sect is, they can\u2019t use their power and influence in Chengdu. But even if they do, it doesn\u2019t matter. We can still protect the White Flower Room.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. So you don\u2019t have to worry, Woo Seonha.\u201dThe original owner of Chengdu was the Tang family.\u00a0When the Tang family was still standing, no one could be said to be their rival in Chengdu. There was a time that even the Emei and Qingcheng sect had to pay attention to the Tang family.But it was such a distant story that she can\u2019t even remember.Then after the fall of the Tang family, Chengdu became free for all. Several sects have entered Chengdu since its owner has disappeared, but none of them have fully ruled over Chengdu.\u00a0As a result, the small to medium sized sects remained and fought in Chengdu. Although they were not large sects, their influence was never small.Seonha was holding the leaders of such influential sects under the width of her skirt.\u201cOh! I may not be able to come to the next meeting, please understand this in advance.\u201d\u201cReally! I may not be able to go to the Rareummyeon meeting, so I hope you will do your best for this first time.\u201d\u201cWoo Seonha cannot come? Is there anything going on?\u201d\u201cSince the movement of the Qingcheng sect has become unusual, there was a summoning order from the headquarters. All of the disciples or descendants of the Emei sect must enter the main mountain.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201dThe men felt sorry for her. Then Go Seongak asked in a loud voice.\u201cWould we be able to join the Emei sect too?\u201d\u201cI know your good intentions, but you can\u2019t.\u201d\u201cIs this because of the policy of the Emei sect?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that\u2026 but I feel bad\u201d\u201cThen there will be no problem. This Go Seong-ak will climb Mount Emei1\u00a0to protect Woo Seonha.\u201d\u201cThe same goes for me! I am willing to sacrifice my life for the sake of the Seonha!\u201d\u201cI will also go and climb Mount Emei!\u201dIn an instant, the floor became noisy. Those who follow Seonha said that they were all willing to climb Mount Emei for her.Seonha quietly took a glass of wine.\u00a0A dark smile appeared on her lips which was covered with a glass of wine.* * *As the night deepened, many of the guests left, leaving only a few left in the guest house.Pyo-wol was one of the few remaining guests.\u00a0There was still some food left on the table. Since Pyo-wol ate so slowly and did not end up eating it all. Pyo-wol left the leftover food and tried to get up.A loud noise was heard from the stairs on the other floor. Seonha and the members of Blue Moon were coming down after their meeting.The atmosphere they had going on was very pleasant.\u00a0Seonha had a satisfied smile. Because the results came out in the direction she wanted.It was clear that her influence would also increase if she led the members of the Blue Moon Assembly to join the Emei sect.\u00a0As she was walking towards a rosy future, her gaze suddenly stopped at a certain man. The man that caught Seonha\u2019s attention was Pyo-wol.Their eyes met in the air.In an instant, a blush appeared on Seonha\u2019s face.\u201cAh!\u201dShe involuntarily let out a sigh. She was instantly overwhelmed by Pyo-wol\u2019s appearance and unique atmosphere.It was the first time for Woo Seonha, who had seduced countless men with her beautiful appearance and manipulated her according to her will, was so mesmerized by another man.After staring at Pyo-wol for a long time, she noticed that there was a soft red light in Pyo-wol\u2019s eyes. But she found it more mysterious than ominous.She was greedy for those eyes that looked like rubies.\u00a0Unknowingly, she turned to Pyo-wol. She opened her mouth with a bright smile.\u201cIt seems like this is the first time I\u2019ve seen you here. Since the Dead Sea is Dongdo, that\u2019s our common name. I\u2019d like to give priority to the department store. If it\u2019s not rude, I\u2019d like to know the name of this Young Master.\u201dPyo-wol looked at Seonha without saying a word for a moment.She felt my heart pounding heavily.His reaction was so unfamiliar that she was even embarrassed.Then Pyo-wol opened his mouth.\u201cPyo-wol.\u201d\u201cSince Young Master Pyo-wol is alone, are you perhaps a warrior?\u201d\u201cThink what you like.\u201d\u201cIs there something you can\u2019t say?\u201d\u201cDo you usually ask a man you\u2019ve seen for the first time like that?\u201d\u201cYes. I mean\u2013?\u201dPyo-wol\u2019s reaction was different from what she expected, so she could not hide her bewildered expression. Then, Go Seong-ak erupted in anger.\u201cAre you trying to mess with Woo Seonha?! Don\u2019t you think you should apologize?\u201dHis face was full of jealousy.Seonha had never shown such interest in himself before. She always showed a smile, but it felt like there was still an invisible line clearly drawn.\u00a0However, when Seonha saw Pyo-wol, he couldn\u2019t see the line in between them.That fact made him angry. He couldn\u2019t be angry with Seonha, so his anger naturally directed towards Pyo-wol instead.\u201cApologize?\u201d\u201cYeah! Get down on your knees and apologize politely to her right now! Otherwise, I won\u2019t let you go.\u201d\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cNo matter how blindly attracted you are towards a single girl, you have to recognize the other person before running wild.\u201d\u00a0\u201cHow dare you insult me? Unforgivable!\u201dShiak!Go Seong-ak pulled out the sword he was wearing around his waist and swung it at Pyo-wol.\u201cHck! Don\u2019t! Young Master!\u201d\u201cShit!\u201dThe men standing beside him were all shouted in surprised, because the sword of Go Seong-ak was already on the verge of reaching Pyowol\u2019s neck.Go Seong-ak\u2019s weakness was that when he got angry, he swung his sword recklessly without thinking. If a large sect such as the Qingming Room was not behind him, all the accidents he had caused would not have been resolved.The men closed their eyes tightly thinking that Go Seong-ak would cause an accident this time as well.Go Seong-ak\u2019s hands were so cruel that they could not bear looking at his unfortunate opponent. The wounds of the people that ended up suffering from his hands were so horrendous that they could not afford to open their eyes.People expected that the same result would happen this time too.\u00a0However, contrary to their thoughts, Pyo-wol\u2019s scream was not heard.When the men opened their eyes and looked up, they saw Go Seong-ak\u2019s weapon being blocked by Pyo-wol. They thought that Go Seong-ak would quickly take care of the situation, but they soon realized that he still hasn\u2019t.\u00a0As soon as Go Seong-ak swung his sword, Pyo-wol stepped back.\u00a0The distance between Pyo-wol and the sword was only about one finger.It was a situation where Pyo-wol\u2019s eyes would have been pierced if he retreated late. People thought that Pyo-wol just got lucky and avoided the sword of Go Seong-ak.\u00a0But the next moment, they realized that it wasn\u2019t like that at all.\u201cBastard!\u201dGo Seong-ak once again opened his swordsmanship.It was the Thunder Wind Sword Art,2\u00a0a sword technique of the Qingming Room.The Thunder Wind Sword Art consists of seven deadly attacks, and it was a brutal sword technique that cannot be underestimated.The fact that he carried out the Thunder Wind Sword Art was proof that Go Seong-ak\u2019s anger had gone all the way to the tip of his head.Shisk!Go Seong-ak repeatedly used the Thunder Wind Sword Art to attack, but regardless of which technique he unleashed, he couldn\u2019t touch Pyo-wol.\u00a0Go Seong-ak\u2019s sword could barely hit Pyo-wol. There was always just a finger size difference.Pyo-wol moved only by a centimeter when he attacked, and when Go Seong-ak stepped back to catch his breath, Pyo-wol moved again by only that much.\u201cAh!\u201d\u201cHow is that possible?\u201dAll the people watching were warriors who had mastered martial arts, so they know how great Pyo-wol\u2019s actions were.If he miscalculates the distance, or if the sword sticks out even a little more, Pyo-wol can easily lose his life.Constantly maintaining that centimeter gap to dodge Go Seong-ak\u2019s attack meant that Pyo-wol understood the breathing and limitations of his opponent.\u00a0However, even if he understood everything about his opponent, it was impossible to show such a movement not unless he\u2019s absolute confidence in his own martial arts.At least, none of the martial artists who were currently watching could move at a level similar to that of Pyo-wol.\u201cDie!\u201dGo Seong-ak rushed and swung his sword. Although desperate efforts were made one after another, his sword never touched Pyo-wol, as his opponent dodge a gap of about a single finger.Go Seong-ak felt like he was dealing with a ghost.\u201cA, are you using sorcery?3\u00a0I can\u2019t forgive you!\u201dHe defined the movement of Pyo-wol that he could not understand as sorcery. It was impossible for him to comprehend Pyo-wol\u2019s movement.However, the ghostly movements that Pyo-wol was showing now were not magic.It was a synchronization based on his fine senses.\u00a0It was a killing method that intuitively predicted and followed the movement of his opponent by matching his breathing and reactions with the enemy he was dealing with.Pyo-wol accurately grasped the limits of Go Seong-ak through synchrony. He quickly grasped the length of his limbs, the limits of the sword, and the distance of his stride. So Pyo-wol only moved exactly by a distance he needed to dodge the incoming attack.A single mistake can lead to his death, but Pyo-wol remained unconcerned.\u00a0\u201cHyukhyuk!\u201dA shrill breath came out of Go Seong-ak. .He looked like he had been possessed. This was because no matter how much he swung his sword, he could not reach Pyo-wol.\u00a0As he unfolded his technique with all his might without thinking, his stamina was exhausted in an instant making him out of breath.Pyo-wol looked at Go Seong-ak and muttered,\u201cThis is the limit.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2014 do you mean by limit?!\u201dGo Seong-ak became furious and ran towards Pyo-wol again. He thought that this time too, Pyo-wol would use his cowardly technique to back down.\u00a0However, Pyo-wol\u2019s movements exceeded his expectations.He saw Pyo-wol\u2019s body wriggling like a snake, and suddenly went for Go Seong-ak\u2019s chest.It was a meandering walk that reproduced the movements of snakes.\u00a0\u201cHck!\u201dThe moment Go Seong-ak opened his eyes wide in surprise, Pyo-wol\u2019s palm already hit his chin. The force that hit his chin shook his brain.Go Seong-ak\u2019s eyes suddenly lost focus.Then his consciousness was blown away.\u201cYoung Master Go!\u201d\u201cCome on and save him!\u201dSurprised by Go Seong-ak collapsing like a sand castle, the men rushed towards Pyo-wol at once. Whatever the circumstances, Go Seong-ak had to be saved from Pyo-wol\u2019s hand. Only then could the status of the Blue Moon Association be maintained.That was then.Ciiit!A dozen lines shot out from Pyo-wol\u2019s waist.Don\u2019t forget to comment down below and let me know what you think of the chapter~ \u2661Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 52": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 52Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayPuboverbuck!Continuous firing echoed inside the guest house.\u201cKeuk!\u201d\u201cHckk!\u201dAt the same time, the men\u2019s screams filled the room. The screams were from the same group of men who rushed to attack against Pyo-wol.\u00a0Small daggers were lodged in their shoulders and thighs. They tossed around on the floor, losing hold of their weapons. In an instant, about a dozen men were incapacitated by the throwing knives.\u00a0This was the moment when the Ghost Knives1\u00a0made its first appearance in the world. With just one hand movement, Pyo-wol accurately used the ten ghost knives on different opponents.It was at a level that no one other than him could do.\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cWhere did he come from?\u201dThere were ten more men still standing, but none of them dared to rush against Pyo-wol. At the appearance of such men, Seonha made a contemptuous expression without realizing it.\u2018These useless guys\u2026\u2019In comparison, the look that Seonha gave towards Pyo-wol was filled with ecstatic emotions. His face was handsome enough for her to be captivated, and he was also so strong that she had no choice but to aim for his heart.\u00a0\u2018If I can control that guy with my charm, it would benefit me much more than having a bunch of useless other guys like that.\u2019\u2019After completing her calculations in an instant, Seonha approached Pyo-wol with an alluring expression.\u201cPyo-wol!Look at the girl\u2019s face and get rid of your anger. These people aren\u2019t bad people. They just rushed wildly because they were worried about me.\u201d\u201cPeople should always be responsible for what they do.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s a natural thing to say. So, why don\u2019t I take the responsibility on their behalf instead?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re going to take responsibility?\u201d\u201cYes, I will.\u201d\u201cDo you know what that means?\u201d\u201cOf course, I know it well, but I don\u2019t think you would be making an unreasonable request. Am I wrong?\u201dSeonha\u2019s pitiful expression was enough to touch the hearts of the viewers.\u201cNo, Woo Seonha! You can\u2019t be put through such humiliation because of us.\u201d\u201cHeuk! We\u2019d rather fight for our lives!\u201dThe men who saw the exchange between the two protested. Some were so resentful that they even shed tears. They thought that Seonha would make the sacrifice for them.Pyo-wol quickly grasped such an atmosphere.\u2018This is pretty good.\u2019Her face is pretty, and she thinks quickly. She knew how to make full use of her outstanding beauty and the situation she was in.To the men of the Blue Moon Association who followed her, it would seem that she sacrificed herself on behalf of them, making them feel resentful. and to Pyo-wol, her demeanor, captivating her, was something that ordinary people could never imitate.\u201cWhat shall I do for you to forgive them? Just tell me. I will follow what you say.\u201dSeonha passed the decision to Pyo-Wol.No matter what Pyo-wol decides on, she had an expression that she would obediently follow.Pyo-wol gently waved his hand. In turn, the dozen throwing knives that were stuck in the men\u2019s bodies were immediately recovered by Pyo-wol.Seeing that, Seonha made an even more surprised expression.It was because, in her eyes, Pyo-wol seemed to have unfolded the feast of the void.The truth is, the ghost was recovered using Suhonsa, not the feast of the void, but Pyo-wol was not obligated to tell her that.The ghost knives were then hidden in Pyo-wol\u2019s belt.Seeing Pyo-wol\u2019s action made Seonha even more greedy.\u00a0\u2018I will do what I can.\u2019She made a more pitiful expression.It was a look that could make any man\u2019s heart fall. However, Pyo-wol, without a single change in expression, said,\u201cLeave.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cIf I need you, I will call you separately.\u201d\u201cBut\u2013\u201d\u201cYour face might be pretty, but you have bad hearing.\u201dAt that moment, a look of embarrassment appeared on Seonha\u2019s face. Because no one had ever lashed out at her like this. Pyo-Wol was the first person to treat her with such a cold attitude despite her beautiful appearance,\u00a0Seonha bit her lip without realizing it.\u00a0However, Pyo-wol did not care, walked passed her and approached the hostess.\u201cWhere is my room?\u201d\u201cOh! Go out the back door and it\u2019s the last room on the first floor of the annex. There are also no guests in the next room, so it should be quiet.\u201dThe hostess responded quickly.A cold sweat was running down her back.She never dreamed that a man she thought only of as being handsome could be such a skilled warrior. All the people in the guesthouse were warriors who has quite a bit of influence and power in Chengdu, but no one dared to attack Pyo-wol.They were overwhelmed by the presence of Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol went into the room the hostess had told him, without even paying attention to those who fell to the floor and groaned in pain.Seonha\u2019s eyes fluttered as she looked at Pyo-wol\u2019s back. She went out for herself and didn\u2019t even pay attention to the men who had been beaten by Pyo-wol.She gently bit his red lips.\u2018Pyo-wol!\u2019* * *Pyo-wol entered the room and lay on the bed without taking off his clothes.He had caused a big scene, but he didn\u2019t regret it. Because it wasn\u2019t done out of a momentary impulse.He was an assassin.Assassins never move without thinking. Assassins were the type of people who would only be convinced with their move once they had finished making a detailed plan, constantly improving their weaknesses and reviewing it dozens of times.\u00a0So was Pyo-wol.From the moment he heard that Seonha was connected to the Emei sect, his head started spinning at a frightening speed.A plan that would have taken an ordinary assassin over several days or weeks was laid out in an instant.\u2018Now all I have to do is wait.\u2019Pyo-wol lay on his arm pillow and stared at the ceiling.The room was silent. No one approached the room where Pyo-wol was staying given the rumors that a scary warrior was holed up in his room.\u00a0Thanks to this, Pyo-wol was able to spend some quiet time.The silence at night makes anyone think a lot.This was also the case for Pyo-wol.As he was alone in a dark room with no candles lit, countless thoughts came to his mind. And all those thoughts had a consistent flow.Sarak! Sarak!The slight noise from the outside interrupted Pyo-wol\u2019s thoughts. It was a sound so subtle that it could never be heard unless that person was on the same level as Pyo-wol.After a while, he heard the door open carefully. However, Pyo-wol did not rise and turned his head to look at the door.Sreuk!The door opened and someone entered slowly.The beautiful woman who came into Pyo-wol\u2019s room wearing a gorgeous dress was Seonha.\u00a0Seonha went out of the guest house together with the Blue Moon Association. However, after she parted ways with them, she secretly returned to the guest house.In order to somehow convince Pyo-wol, she even threw her face away.eEven though Seonha suddenly entered his room, Pyo-wol was not surprised. He already expected that she would behave like this after understanding the personality of Seonha.Seonha cautiously approached Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol raised his upper body and looked at her indifferently.Their eyes met in the dark.Pyo-wol\u2019s eyes were a brilliant red in the dark. Seonha was captivated by the eyes of Pyo-wol.\u201cPyo-wol, I have something to tell you.\u201dAt that moment, Pyo-wol stood up. Seonha\u2019s shoulders flinched. But Pyo-wol continued to approach her without hesitation. Seonha tried to hide her rapid breathing and spoke quickly.\u201cI will give you a big reward if you can help me.\u201d\u201cWhat reward?\u201d\u201cWhether it\u2019s gold, silver, or any treasure you want just tell me. I\u2019ll get it for you.\u201dAt that moment, Pyo-wol placed his hand on Seonha\u2019s shoulder. He only touched her lightly, but Seonha\u2019s breathing already became quicker, with her cheeks burning up.\u00a0Up until now, she had seduced many men, put them on the palm of her hand, and taken over their heads, but strangely, she couldn\u2019t straighten out her appeal in front of Pyo-wol.Just by being close to Pyo-wol, her whole body was trembling and she couldn\u2019t breathe properly.Pyo-wol smiled.His smile was strangely visible even in the thick darkness.Seeing Pyo-wol\u2019s smile made Seonha thunderstruck as if her heart was being pierced with an awl. Pyo-wol whispered in her ear.\u201cI only want one person.\u201d\u201cW-Who?\u201d\u201cYou.\u201dAs if an earthquake had occurred, the pupils of Seonha shook. Pyo-wol\u2019s hand caressed her neck. She could not refuse his touch.\u00a0\u201cI, I\u2026\u201dTutuk!Clothes started to fall from her body piece by piece. Not once did she rebel, she just stood there like a statue waiting. Finally, all the clothes fell off her body, revealing her pure white naked body.Pyo-wol slowly looked at her from head to toe and said,\u201cBeautiful.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dSeonha\u2019s red lips parted slightly.She has heard countless times that her beauty is in full bloom. So for her, hearing the word \u201cbeautiful\u201d was not that special.\u00a0But when Pyo-wol said it, it became a special word.\u201cI\u2019ll only give you one chance.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIf you want to leave, you\u2019re free to get out now. But if you choose stay, you won\u2019t be able to get out of my hands.\u201d\u201cI, I\u2013\u201d\u201cNo words are needed. Decide by your actions.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dThere was no answer that came out of her.\u00a0Pyo-wol hugged her smooth waist and said,\u201cI\u2019ll take that as your answer.\u201dHis lips touched Seonha\u2019s neck. Seonha trembled as if struck by lightning.\u201cHaa!\u201dA sweet breath escaped from between her slightly parted red lips. Pyo-wol soon captured her lips with his own.From then on, she could maintain a clear memory of what happened. A feeling of bliss to the extent of blowing her mind took over her whole body.Pyo-wol persistently tormented her.She had nowhere to run and hide.Seonha moaned and whimpered all night.It was late in the morning when she woke up.Seonha\u2019s naked body was held in Pyo-wol\u2019s arms. She didn\u2019t feel the cold. It felt as if the heat of last night was still in the air. It had been a hot time.For the first time in her life, she passed out several times before coming to her senses. No other man had ever satisfied her so far.Seonha was staring blankly at Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol by nature was not just good looking but he also knew how to satisfy a woman.\u00a0It was Seonha\u2019s first time meeting a man like him.\u00a0Pyo-wol opened his eyes as if he had sensed Seonha\u2019s gaze. As she looked into the eyes that had soft red light, her whole body lost its strength again.\u00a0Nonetheless, she tried to put on a casual expression. It was because she did not want to admit that she was completely bewitched by Pyo-Wol.Still, she couldn\u2019t give up her desire to dominate Pyo-wol.\u00a0Seon-ha put her white naked body on top of Pyo-wol. She pressed her soft chest against Pyo-wol\u2019s and looked down.This temptation was hard for any man to refuse.\u00a0Knowing that fact, Seonha put her body against\u00a0 Pyo-wol\u2019s and looked at him with a gentle gaze.\u201cWhat are you going to do now?\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cAre you going to pretend we don\u2019t know each other? We\u2019re the only ones here. We have a physical relationship.\u201d\u201cSo what do you want?\u201d\u201cJust do me a favor. If it\u2019s you, it won\u2019t be too difficult.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll listen to it first and decide after.\u201d\u201cI ask you to only kill one person.\u201d\u201cIs this an assassination contract?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a request rather than a contract. You can just take it as a light request between lovers.\u201dPyo-wol did not answer right away, but looked at Seon-ha half-heartedly. Seonha did not dare to look into his eyes and turned her head to avoid his gaze.\u00a0\u201cWho do you want to kill?\u201d\u201cNam Ho-san. He\u2019s the rumored master of the Thunder Gates2.\u201d\u201cThunder Gates?\u201dPyo-wol furrowed his brow slightly.The Thunder gates was one of the three gates. They were the strongest power after the Qingcheng and Emei sect. It was a powerful group that stood shoulder to shoulder with White Gates3\u00a0and Gold Gates4.When Pyo-wol seemed to be interested, Seon-ha smiled and continued to explain,The Thunder Gates is originally not a sect from Sichuan Province. It is a sect created by descendants of Soroeumsa when the Qingcheng sect and Emei sect came to visit.\u00a0The situation changed when the power in Sichuan was greatly concentrated as the Qingcheng and the Emei sect reunited.When there were no forces paying attention, the descendants of Soroeumsa came in secretly and founded the Thunder Gates. When the Qingcheng sect and Emei sect found out about it, the Thunder Gates had already firmly established its roots in Sichuan.\u201cTae Yeon-ho, the sect leader of the Thunder Gates, recently sent someone to promote So-ju and I to get married. If I refused, he threatened to ally their sect with the Qingcheng sect. Because of that, the White Flower Room and the Emei sect are now in a very difficult situation.\u201dThe reputation of the Thunder Gates in Sichuan was really bad. Among them, the reputation of Nam Ho-san, was at the lowest.Because he was warlike, many warriors in Sichuan were afraid of him.If Seonha married Nam Ho-san, the Emei sect would gain a powerful ally which is the Thunder Gates. Otherwise, their reputation could not help but fall. So Seonha couldn\u2019t just refuse the marriage proposal.\u00a0As long as the Thunder Gates attached themselves to the Qingcheng sect, the weight of the game will surely lean their way. It was a situation they couldn\u2019t help but accept or else, the Emei will remain inferior.\u201cSo you want me to kill Nam Ho-san?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou must have already calculated that if I failed this request, you can just argue that it\u2019s not related to the White Flower Room because no one was in contact with me.\u201dFor a moment, Seonha felt goosebumps rising behind her back.\u2018He\u2019s too excellent. Besides being great in martial arts, he\u2019s also perceptive and quick-witted.\u201dSeonha indeed thought that far. Whether Pyo-wol succeeded or failed, it would cause no problem in the White Flower Room and the Emei sect.\u00a0It was starting to feel more and more burdensome.It seemed like she had to offer a sweeter price to make Pyo-wol do her bidding.\u00a0\u201cIf you can kill Nam Ho-san, I\u2019ll tell my aunt from the Emei sect to repay you.\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s your aunt?\u201d\u201cJeonhwa. She\u2019s one of the great disciples of the Abbess of Nine Calamities, the sect leader of Emei.\u201dPyo-wol blinked at the unexpected answer.\u00a0But that was also for a while.\u00a0Soon white teeth appeared along the corner of his mouth.\u201cAlright.\u201dOh god. I died trying to understand and edit the end part of this chapter\u2026 Especially the explanation part about the Thunder Gates\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 53": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 53Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMount Emei could be reached by walking south of Chengdu for three days and three nights.The magnificent scenery, which has a height of more than a thousand meters, was worthy to be a part of Sichuan Province.When the people of Sichuan think of Mount Emei, five things come to mind.The first was the sea of clouds.Those who saw the sea of \u200b\u200bclouds covering the entire mountain range, leaving only the high mountain peaks, were overwhelmed by its immense majesty.The second was sunrise.Specifically the sunrise from the Chengdu Plain on the eastern side of Mount Emei. No matter how many times the people looked at the scenery, they would never get tired of the landscape which was dyed with a golden hue.\u00a0The third was the light of the Buddha.A seven-light rainbow appears from summer to early autumn near the Geumjeongbong Peak, and when this rainbow illuminates a person, a phenomenon like the halo of Buddha occurs. People accepted this as the blessing of the Buddha.The fourth was the holy lantern.In summer, tens of millions of fireflies fly all at once and shine brightly. Its appearance is so sacred that it was accepted in Buddhism as a bodhisattva illuminating the world for the sake of the world.The fifth and last was the Emei sect.Emei, located at the foot of Geumjeongbong Peak of Emei Mountain, has been called as the pride of the people of Sichuan.Although they have declined, in comparison to when they belonged to the old Daemun faction, their prestige was still great.The Emei sect was a large Buddhist temple before being a sect. For that reason, many people come to Emei to offer Buddhist offerings. But lately, people have stopped going.This is because, as the confrontation with the Qingcheng sect intensified, the Emei sect did not receive incense from the visitors.Instead, only the martial artists members of the sect related to the Emei sect visited Mount Emei.Numerous gates were installed on the mountain road leading up to Emei, and Emei warriors stood guard.In order to enter the Emei sect, a person had to go through several layers of gates.Sangyeon, a third generation disciple of Emei, looked at the men and women standing in front of her with a keen eye.A bewitching woman in revealing attire and a man with a large body were looking into her eyes with a casual expression.\u201cSo, you\u2019re saying that the Black Cloud Mercenary Group came to see the sect leader?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. We\u2019ve come to meet the sect leader of the Emei sect under the command of our Danju.\u201dThe bewitching woman who answered with a smile was Heo Ran-ju. She was accompanied by Oh Yuk-pyo.\u201cIt\u2019s not up to me to decide. I\u2019ll report it to the higher ups first, so please wait here.\u201d\u201cHo-ho! We can wait.\u201dSang-yeon looked at Heo Ran-ju with distasteful eyes, who had revealing clothes that did not match the sacred Buddhist temple.\u00a0\u2018Amitabha! He said that his nickname is hyeoljiju (\u8840 \u8718\u59b9), so he really looks like Sagal.\u2019Had she been in a situation where she could make her own decisions, she would never have accepted a woman like Heo Ran-ju into the Emei. But now, they were at war, and the Emei sect needed anything that could increase their power.She couldn\u2019t make a mistake just because of her personal feelings.Her reputation for subduing the enemies that attacked the rice carrier was passed on to the Emei sect. So Sang-yeon knew that Heo Ran-ju was a great warrior.\u00a0Sang-yeon brought out a carrier pigeon and waited for an answer.It didn\u2019t take long for a reply to come back.There was a message in the carrier pigeon that returned asking her to send them in. Sang-yeon handed a bronze plate to Heo Ran-ju and Oh Yuk-pyo and said,\u201cIf you climb the mountain road like this, you will come across a total of five gates. You can enter the main mountain by showing this bronze plate every time you pass through the gates.\u201d\u201cHo-ho! Thank you for your consideration. I\u2019ll see you when I come down.\u201d\u00a0After winking at Sang-yeon, Heo Ran-ju passed through the gate with Oh Yuk-pyo.Sang-yeon\u2019s disapproving gaze was felt on the back of her head, but she didn\u2019t care much. She wasn\u2019t even a great disciple, and her self-esteem didn\u2019t allow her to be afraid of a third-generation disciple.\u201cMount Emei is said to be the absolute best in the world. Indeed, it\u2019s truly something to be proud of.\u201dOh Yuk-pyo looked around and admired the scenery of Mount Emei.The superb view of Mount Emei was so great that it shook the hearts of Oh Yuk-pyo who was usually\u00a0 indifferent to these external sights.\u201cAnyway, it\u2019s all useless if they lose the war against the Qingcheng sect. They\u2019ll know better how miserable the words of the clan who were expelled from Mount Emeimust be.\u201d\u201cBut why are they fighting the Qingcheng sect? Were they not on good terms?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know! Seven years ago, their relationship just got worse and they started fighting.\u201d\u201cHm! We don\u2019t exactly know why they\u2019re fighting each other, but nonetheless, for us, this is a great opportunity to earn a lot of money.\u201d\u201cIt was a match promoted by Danju and there was nothing that didn\u2019t cost money. We can only believe in Danju.\u201d\u201cHoho, of course. I don\u2019t believe in anyone else except for Danju.\u201dHeo Ran-ju nodded at the words of Oh Yuk-pyo. It was the same with Heo Ran-ju. Everyone in the world was suspicious, with the exception of Danju.\u00a0As she thought of Danju, a person suddenly came to mind.\u2018Pyo-wol!\u2019She didn\u2019t know why he was coming to her mind at this moment.Maybe it was because he was so handsome. The image of Pyo-wol was still vividly etched in her mind.\u201cWhat are you thinking about? Are you thinking of that handsome guy?\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d\u201cHuh! I want to see him too.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t set your eyes on the person I picked up first. He\u2019s not someone who you could covet.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. There is no male bastard who didn\u2019t get over because these five groups made up their mind.\u201dThe laughter of Oh Yuk-pyo made Heo Ran-ju\u2019s mood even worse.Why does she have to go with a bastard like him? She really don\u2019t know what Danju is thinking.\u201cHuh! It\u2019s all because Danju-sama\u2019s eyes are high. If it\u2019s not me, who will control the four years?\u201d\u201cWho controls who? Crazy bastard!\u201dThe two turned their heads away from each other.After fighting like that, I arrived at Geumjeongbong Peak where Emei was located.\u201cHuyu!\u201dOh Yuk-pyo, who saw the Emei sect, whistled.Oh Yuk-pyo was a confident man who\u2019s not afraid of anything in the world, but now his face was full of tension.It was the same with Heo Ran-ju.They had no choice but to feel that way.Establishments which boast the sect\u2019s immense power, were spread out in front of them. If the buildings were only large, there was no reason for the two of them to be nervous.But a great momentum as enormous as the weight of the name the Emei sect was felt in the premises.Despite the fact that the Black Cloud Mercenary Group has been gaining momentum recently, it cannot be compared to the weight and presence of the Emei, who have been establishing its roots in Sichuan for hundreds of years.The aura that naturally radiated from being part of a noble family of a prestigious sect made even two people who have lived a rough life as a rogue withdrawn.A middle-aged woman approached them.The woman approaching with her back straight, had an unusual momentum.\u201cMy name is Cheol-shim. Are you two from the Black Cloud Group?\u201dShe was Cheol-shim, who was the current student of the Abbess of Nine Calamities.\u00a0Seven years made her stronger. Her martial arts also progressed by leaps and bounds, securing the position of the third person following Jeonghwa.Heo Ran-ju replied politely.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cMaster is waiting. Follow me.\u201dCheol Shim took the two of them to the Daejeon in Emei.Dozens of martial artists stood guard outside the Daejeon.They stared at Heo Ran-ju and Oh Yuk-pyo with sharp eyes as if they were about to mutilate them. It\u2019s the first time they have seen an outsider, so they were wary.\u2018They really live up to their name of being a prestigious sect. Even the soldiers standing on the border have reached such a level.\u2019Heo Ran-ju felt a cold sweat running down her back.She could tell by looking at them what the power of the soldiers was.The quantity and quality of martial arts that have been systematically passed down from a young age were not something that a rogue group such as the Black Cloud Mercenary Group could match.\u00a0The gap was so great between the two that no matter how much time passed, it could never be closed.\u2018Anyway, we just need to make money.\u2019The two groups were originally created for different purposes. So if she tries to compare the two groups, she would only feel inferior.\u00a0She\u2019d rather focus on the purpose of coming here in the first place.The door of Daejeon opened and the two went inside together with Cheol-sim.Inside Daejeon, there was a large chair, and to its left and right were the disciples of the Emei Most of the disciples were women, and had a high rank within the Emei.Among them, there were three people who stood out.The old woman sitting in the middle, the one-eyed middle-aged woman sitting next to her, and the beautiful woman in her twenties sitting opposite her.They were special in different ways.\u00a0The old woman sitting was Guhwasata, the oldest member of the Emei family.With her crow-like appearance and eyes, there was an overflowing sense of intimidation that made even Heo Ran-ju and Oh Yuk-yo swallow dry saliva.The one-eyed woman who wore an eyepatch, was the great disciple, Jeonghwa. A ferocious momentum was radiating from her that was no less than the Guhwasata.\u00a0She was staring at them with one eye, as if she was about to eat them.The woman as beautiful as the Seonha was Yong Seol-ran, the youngest disciple of the Guhwasata.Seven years of time made Yong Seol-ran even more beautiful. Even though they were both women, Heo Ran-ju fell in love with the appearance of Yong Seol-ran.\u2018This is dangerous.\u2019Heo Ran-ju, who managed to come to her senses, bit her lip.At that time, Guhwasata opened his mouth.\u201cDid the master of the Black Cloud Group send you?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cWhy did he send a messenger?\u201dThere was a hint of dissatisfaction in the voice of the Guhwasata.In ordinary times, a mercenary would not have been brought into their holy place. But now, the Emei sect was facing its worst crisis ever due to the confrontation with the Qingcheng sect.\u00a0Heo Ran-ju, who picked up her breath for a moment, said their business.\u201cDanju wishes to offer the services of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group to help the Emei sect.\u201d\u201cSo, you want to participate in the battle against the Qingcheng sect?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way a group of mercenaries would shed blood for free, so there must be a price you want.\u201d\u201cYes. We can\u2019t be on the losing side either.\u201d\u201cHow much do you want?\u201d\u201cI think 500,000 gold would be appropriate.\u201dThe moment Heo Ran-ju opened his mouth, the atmosphere in Daejeon changed.\u201cSuch crazy things!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re asking for such a huge amount?\u201d\u201cMaster! We don\u2019t have to hear any more. If we accept such a request, our sect will become the laughing stock of Jianghu.\u201dIf it was 500,000 nyang of gold, a few years would be enough to run Emei on a budget.That\u2019s why a group of mercenaries were asking for such a huge amount of money a day. It was an amount that was absolutely unacceptable for the Emei disciples.Guhwasa\u2019s eyes narrowed.To assassinate Woo Gunsang of the Qingcheng sect, the amount requested by the Blood Shadow Group was 500,000 nyang of gold. However, there was little loss in recovering the gold that was given to them while destroying the Blood Shadow Group and the riches hidden in the remarks. However, that did not mean that she could hand over such a huge amount to the Black Cloud Group.\u201cYou don\u2019t think I will accept your proposal, do you? 500,000 gold nyang is enough to call a few more mercenary groups like you.\u201d\u201cBut no other group of mercenaries will be as strong as the Black Cloud Group.\u201d\u201cWhat if I refuse?\u201d\u201cBy now, martial artists of the Black Cloud Group should have arrived at Mt. Qingcheng.\u201d\u201cAre you laying both legs across? Cheeky!\u201dTuoung!A strong wave was emitted from the Abbess of Nine Calamities.\u201cKeuk!\u201d\u201cHiic!\u201dThe complexions of Heo Ran-ju and Oh Yuk-pyo turned white. Dark red blood was running down their lips. They immediately suffered internal injuries from the aura emitted by the Abbess of Nine Calamities.\u2018Is this the prowess of the sect leader of Emei?\u2019\u2018It\u2019s scary. To have this kind of momentum from such an old woman.\u2019The two had to use their internal energy to correct their trembling state.\u00a0It was not because of nothing that Guhwasata managed to become the sect leader of Emei. It was because of her martial arts and leadership that Emei, who was inferior to the Qingcheng sect, was still able to survive.All the warriors of the Emei sect respected and followed her, even if they were ordered to kill a person from the Qingcheng sect.Even though there was blood on their lips, Heo Ran-ju and Oh Yuk-pyo tried their best to keep a calm expression.This was a fight of momentum.The moment they show weakness, they would be pushed by the momentum of the Abbess of Nine Calamities and be eaten up.The Abbess of Nine Calamities opened her mouth.\u201cTell me honestly. I know you really don\u2019t think I\u2019ll give you 500,000 gold. Just tell me how much you really want.\u201d\u201cWe are mercenaries who sell their force. We follow clients who\u2019s capable of paying more. If you give us more money, even a single chime, you will become our master.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re not going to tell me until the end? You\u2019re probably going to say the same thing to the Qingcheng sect.\u201dHeo Ran-ju didn\u2019t answer. However, the Guhwasata already accepted her answer as an established fact.\u201cYou\u2019re so bold. It makes me want to see the face of your Danju, in person.\u201d\u201cIf you ask us, it will be so.\u201d\u201cHck!\u201dGuhwasata\u2019s eyes softened a little.In her heart, she wanted to give a lesson to the master of the Black Cloud Group by cutting the two people in front of her at once.If it had been an ordinary time, rather than wartime, the Emei sect would have never negotiated with the Black Cloud Group.The problem is that the confrontation with the Qingcheng sect has reached its climax.A large-scale conflict will soon occur.It is said that in order to defeat the Qingcheng sect, even a cat\u2019s hand has to be borrowed.It will be the same for the Qingcheng sect.They were superior to the Emei sect, but there was no guarantee that they wouldn\u2019t hire the Black Cloud Group to win.\u2018Clever. Really clever.\u2019Guhwasata tapped the handle of her chair with her finger for a long time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Chengdu was the largest city in Sichuan Province, but it only took one day for the rumors to spread throughout the country.The name of the man who gave the Blue Moon Association disgrace or even the sect he came from remained unknown.Only one thing is certain.\u00a0It was that his martial arts were very strong.\u00a0And even though he was a man, it was said that he had an extremely beautiful appearance.\u00a0Bang!The thick desk made of rosewood was shattered by the punch of the Qingming Room\u2019s Ki Joo-han.\u201cSo, you\u2019re saying that you came back from being beaten and humiliated by someone whom you don\u2019t even know nor from which he\u2019s from.\u201d\u201cSo, sorry, Master!\u201dGo Seong-ak knelt in front of Ki Joo-han and trembled.Ki Joo-han looked down at Go Seong-ak with contemptuous eyes.Rumors that the successor of the Qingming Room had been defeated by an unknown young martial artist had already spread throughout Chengdu.It was extremely rare for a warrior to fight ten times and win all those fights. Such people who can do so eventually stand out, rise to the top and become a powerhouse.Go Seong-ak wasn\u2019t like that.If it\u2019s a matter of ten fights, he will win around three or four times, and if you struggle for days or days, it is a description at the level of understanding one or eight.In fact, the Qingming Room could not afford to write more than that. As such, Ki Joo-han\u2019s expectations for Go Seong-ak were not very high.He simply hoped that he would follow in his footsteps and lead the Qingming Room without problems. However, Go Seong-ak could not even act in accordance to his simple hope.\u201cTo be defeated by an unknown scoundrel and damage the reputation of the sect.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Master! But he was by no means a nameless fool.\u201d\u201cShut up! Are you calling that an excuse?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true, Master! He is by no means a simple warrior. It is clear that he approached us for some purpose.\u201d\u201cFor what purpose?\u201dAt Ki Joo-han\u2019s question, Go Seong-ak shook his head.In fact, his words were just uttered haphazardly to defend himself. There was no evidence or fact behind his words at all. However, as long as Ki Joo-han showed interest, he had to make up and say something.\u00a0\u201cThat guy must be connected with the Qingcheng sect. Since we\u2019re helping the Emei sect, it\u2019s possible that the Qingcheng sect sent him to interfere in our affairs.\u201d\u2018\u201cQingcheng sect\u2026\u201dKi Joo-han thought there was a reason.The Qingming Room has been completely neutral until now.\u00a0It was only purely because of Go Seong-ak that the Qingming Room became affiliated with the Emei sect. Because he likes Seon-ha, he has no choice but to follow them.\u2018It\u2019s dangerous if the Qingcheng sect really intervened.\u2019The reason why Qingming Room has been able to prosper so far was because they have been exquisitely riding a single tightrope while keeping an eye on both sides.Ki Joo-han felt his heart grow cold.\u201cUntil I have ascertained all the details, you should take care of yourself. Approaching the Woo Seonha is also prohibited for the time being.\u201d\u201cMaster! I\u2019m fine with everything else, but please don\u2019t forbid me from seeing Woo Seonha! She is my everything.\u201d\u201cQuiet.Are you just going to endanger the security of the sect because you\u2019re blinded by a girl?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that\u2026\u201d\u201cOkay. Be careful as I said. I\u2019ll take care of the rest. You should know that if you break my orders, I\u2019ll never forgive you.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dGo Seong-ak barely answered. The expression on his face shows that he couldn\u2019t accept the orders of his master. But he wasn\u2019t stupid enough to express any more dissatisfaction.As long as the master orders something, he has to pretend to listen. But that didn\u2019t mean the anger in his heart was gone.\u2018That bastard! I will never let you go.\u2019He vowed to take revenge on Pyo-wol who\u2019s responsible for putting him in this situation.* * *Pyo-wol came out of the guest house.Because of the rumors that a deity had appeared in Chengdu, many people came to visit.Some tried to confirm whether Pyo-wol was as handsome as rumored, while others tried to figure out if he really was capable of exhibiting strong martial arts.Pyo-wol left the guest house altogether as things became more and more troublesome.The first thing he did when he came out on the streets was to buy a long scarf. The scarf covers his neck and up to his lips, revealing only his eyes and nose.That didn\u2019t completely hide his handsome face, but at least it prevented people\u2019s attention.Pyo-wol walked through Chengdu with his face covered with a scarf.His destination was the Thunder gates.Thunder Gates was located in an area called Jintang County to the east of Chengdu. Jintang County itself was a big city that was just a short distance from the capital.Thunder gates was said to have perfect control over Jintang County.To kill the Young Master Nam Ho-san, Pyo-wol had to figure out the topography of the area first.Securing a perfect infiltration route and a safe escape route was the first step in assassination. Pyo-wol studied assassination techniques for seven years, while another seven years were spent learning the Aguido.\u00a0That didn\u2019t mean that his assassination skills have rusted.The road to Jintang County was well paved. The traffic between the two cities was so heavy that many people filled the streets.There were a lot of wagons being pulled around and many people carrying different kinds of goods.Many people in particular came from Jintang County. Since Chengdu is the larger city, the amount of goods coming in towards Jintang County is much higher.There were so many people moving along the street that no one paid any attention to Pyo-wol. Thanks to this, Pyo-wol was able to arrive in Jintang County with ease.The first thing he did after arriving at Jintang County was to directly examine the Thunder gates.The Thunder gate was huge in scale, as if boasting about its prestige.There were more than two hundred fences surrounding it on all sides, and over a dozen or so huge full-angled roofs above the high fence.The main gate was large enough to accommodate three or four wagons at once, and at the entrance, about a dozen soldiers stood guard.At a glance, it was clear that the security was tight.Pyo-wol slowly walked around the wall, as if he had come out to view the spectacle. There were a lot of people watching with him because the scenery around the Thunder Gate was rumored to be beautiful.Thanks to this, Pyo-wol was able to look around the Thunder gate without feeling out of place.\u2018The north looks the most lax, but in truth its security is the tightest. In comparison, since the west border looks perfect, there are a lot of soldiers being carefree. If I want to infiltrate, going through the west side is better.\u2019He simply didn\u2019t choose the west side just because it was easy to penetrate. It was also a good side for securing an escape route because it was directly connected to the downtown area where there were many small mansions. These buildings would make it easy for him to find a place to hide.Pyo-wol changed his clothes. It was a garment made of cheap cotton cloth, which was mainly worn by the people of the mansion. He also changed his face a bit.It is an application of the face changing art he learned from So Gyeoksan a long time ago.He didn\u2019t even touch his face much. Just a few minor tweaks to change his overall atmosphere.When Pyo-wol changed his eyes, the atmosphere was completely different from a little while ago.In his new state, Pyo-wol walked around every corner of the mansion.The alley was very dirty. Because there are so many people living together, various kinds of filth were overflowing resulting in a bad smell lingering around the area.\u00a0Still, Pyo-wol moved on without a change in his expression. To him, such a smell could not be called a stench.It took Pyo-wol almost half a day to fully understand the alley.The thing he cared about the most was the ability of staying inconspicuous. When people feel someone is an outsider, they pay them more attention. That way, these outsiders would be imprinted in people\u2019s memories.To prevent such a situation, Pyo-wol created the same atmosphere to blend in with the people living in the mansion. This was so that no one walking in the alley could feel the fact that Pyo-wol was actually not from their place.After familiarizing himself with all the alleys, Pyo-wol returned to his original form and stayed in a guest house near the Thunder gates.The front door of the Thunder gates was clearly visible from the guest house.Pyo-wol sat by the window and carefully watched the people entering the front door. As if to show its power and influence, many people visited the Thunder gates.Pyo-wol carefully examined the faces of the people coming out of the Thunder gates. He was trying to infer the mood of the people from the sect through their facial expressions.The facial expressions of those who came out of the sect were all rigid. It meant that they felt a lot of pressure while they were inside the Thunder gates.\u201cDamn! I can\u2019t trade properly! What kind of amount is that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s said that if you trade with the Thunder Gates, you will lose all of your profit.\u201dAs if to prove Pyo-wol\u2019s conjecture, the merchants who had traded with the Thunder gates entered into the guest house and complained. Even as they sat in their seats, they continued on with their conversation. Pyo-wol quietly listened to their stories.\u201cHow the heck can they squeeze so much\u2026\u201d\u201cUgh! It looks like you\u2019ve lost your soul. Did you see it too? Two large warehouses full of grain. For them to\u00a0 pile up grain like that and still try to buy grain at a low price. Did they lose against their enemies because of grains in their past life?\u201d\u201cWho isn\u2019t it? After all, there are more people.\u201dThe information coming out of the mouths of the merchants was just normal chatter. Still, Pyo-wol listened to them without missing a single word.In the guest house, where Pyo-wol was located, there were many people who traded with the Thunder gates. Probably because it was close to the sect.While Pyo-wol was learning about the Thunder gates, an unexpected person entered the audience.It was a Go Dosa who went with Heo Ran-ju.Go Dosa also found Pyo-wol and made an expression of surprise. He then came closer with a smile on his face.\u201cNow, who is this? What are you doing here? To see you here, what a great coincidence.\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\u201cHeh heh! There are many things to see in Jintang County, so I came to see it for a while.\u201dGo Dosa sat down in front of Pyo-wol as if it was natural.\u201cOh, can I sit down?\u201d\u201cAs you please.\u201d\u201cHeh heh! Thank you. It was boring to go alone, but it\u2019s nice to see a familiar face like this.\u201dGo Dosa chuckled and laughed. His face was glistening with sweat, as if he had been running out a lot. Go Dosa called a waiter and ordered food and drinks.Pyo-wol asked Go Dosa.\u201cAre you together with the rest of your party?\u201d\u201cEveryone\u2019s been separated for a while because of work. Well, don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll get back together soon. How about you, what are you here for?\u201d\u201cI have a job.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cJust something personal.\u201d\u201cIs that so? I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but I hope everything works out well for you.\u201dGo Dosa fanned his hands and secretly observed Pyo-wol\u2019s whereabouts. He was secretly collecting information about the sects in Sichuan under the orders of Zhang Muryang.He could have directly asked for information about the movement of the sects, but if he did, information that the Black Cloud Mercenary group was slowly making a move could leak out.The most important to Zhang Mu-ryang, the leader of the Black Cloud Brigade, was the control of information. They had to quickly obtain any information that could be considered as a threat, and prevent this information from leaking out.The person who did this best job was Go Dosa. For that reason, Zhang Mu-ryang entrusted Go Dosa with the task of collecting information.\u201cOh! Ran-ju really wants to see you. She has a little bit of a temper, but she\u2019s not that bad. If we see each other again later, we\u2019ll give you a treat.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever see you again.\u201d\u201cAs long as you stay in Chengdu, we will surely meet again.\u201d\u201cSo will you be staying in Chengdu for a long time?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to be months or years, but I\u2019m planning on staying here for quite some time this time.\u201d\u201cLooks like you\u2019ve caught a big bottle of water.\u201d\u201cWater? What do you mean?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Just nonsense.\u201dGo Dosa frowned and looked at Pyo-wol.\u2018Interesting, does he know something?\u2019He suddenly had his doubts. From the moment they first met, he was somehow vigilant towards Pyo-wol. Aside from his non-human-like appearance, his pessimistic aura and eyes made the viewer feel strangely wary.\u2018And we still don\u2019t know anything about his true identity and objective.\u2019After entering Chengdu, Go Dosa moved around more than anyone else.He intensively delved into the powers and trends of the sects in Sichuan Province. Because he was dealing with too many things at once, he had no choice but to neglect researching the identity of Pyo-wol.\u00a0But seeing Pyo-wol again like this, he felt that he should have known about him more than anything else.\u201cHow long do you plan to stay in the Thunder gates?\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t be long.\u201d\u201cAre you going to go back to Chengdu again?\u201d\u201cWhy are you asking so much? Do I have to tell you every move I do?\u201d\u201cWhy are you talking so harshly? I\u2019m just asking because I\u2019m curious. It\u2019s not normal to meet again like this, so can\u2019t I know that much?\u201d\u201cI disagree, you think differently.\u201d\u201cHeh heh! I\u2019m usually a bit broad. As I get older, I get more curious. I hope you understand.\u201dIf it had been anyone else, he would have been furious or embarrassed by Pyo-wol\u2019s words, but Go Dosa just smiled and replied.\u00a0Pyo-wol looked at Go Dosa with deep set eyes.\u2018It won\u2019t be easy to shake him off.\u2019Go Dosa\u2019s eyes were insistently following him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 55": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 55Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZhang Mu-ryang could not sleep.He originally just sleeps a little, but there were many cases where he couldn\u2019t sleep at all, especially when he had more important things to do.That\u2019s what happened this time.It was a gamble to ride the line between the Emei sect and Qingcheng sect, the absolute two strongholds of Sichuan. If they failed, the Black Cloud Mercenary Group could disappear without a trace in the world.Although the Black Cloud Mercenary Group was said to be a group of rogues with strong military power, they could still not survive a head-on confrontation with the Emei and Qingcheng sect.\u00a0So the tightrope was important.Neither the Qingcheng sect nor the Emei sect would have normally cared about them, but things have changed.The two sects were in sharp opposition to each other, and they were facing a head-to-head confrontation. In a situation where one sect\u2019s power was lacking, having the Black Cloud Mercenary Group join their sect could make it possible for the weight of the battlefield to lean on one side.\u00a0Knowing this, Zhang Mu-ryang boldly jumped into the conflict between the Emei sect and the Qingcheng sect.He knew his plan was going to go well, but he still couldn\u2019t help but get nervous.The lives of three hundred and fifty men of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group depended on his decision.\u201cTsk! I really should retire after this job is over.\u201dZhang Mu-ryang clicked his tongue. This was the biggest gamble in the history of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group. If they manage to succeed, they can gain a huge advantage, but if they fail, they will disappear without a trace.Zhang Mu-ryang went out to wash his face.He stayed up all night with his eyes wide open, so his eyes felt heavy. At that moment, he saw the Go Dosa come into the guest house.\u201cDanju!\u201d\u201cAre you returning now?\u201d\u201cI was originally going to come back yesterday, but then I met someone.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d\u201cI met him by chance the other day, and he accompanied me to this neighborhood. His name is Pyo-wol.\u201d\u201cIs he the guy who you said was super handsome?\u201d\u201cYes. I met him in Jintang County.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the place where the Thunder Gates is located.\u201dZhang Mu-ryang touched his chin with his hand.\u201cThat\u2019s right. I went to investigate the Thunder gates, then I stumbled upon him there.\u201d\u201cBy chance?\u201d\u201cYes. It was actually a coincidence. Why? Is it strange?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it? To see him twice in Sichuan, not anywhere else. It may be a coincidence that the two of you met, but if you look at the circumstances, it is clear that there is a certain cause and effect at work.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s what you\u2019re saying then it must be that. Do you want to monitor him?\u201dGo Dosa trusted Zhang Mu-ryang.Zhang Mu-ryang has a very good sense of intuition and sixth sense, so he never overlooks any unusual things, no matter how small.If he said it was strange, then it\u2019s strange. If he cared, then there must have been a good reason. That was the extent of Go Dosa and the Black Cloud Mercenary Group\u2019s trust in Zhang Mu-ryang.\u201cKeep an eye on his whereabouts, but make sure he never notices that we\u2019ve put a tail on him.\u201d\u201cOf course. I\u2019ll have Maun follow him.\u201dMaun was from the military and was the most nimble and quick-witted person in the Black Cloud Mercenary Group. For that reason, there was no one above him in terms of reconnaissance and surveillance.\u201cSo, what is going on inside of the Thunder Gates?\u201d\u201cSo Young Master Nam Ho-san seems to have fallen for Woo Seonha of the White Flower Room. If the marriage takes place, he will probably stand on the side of the Emei sect.\u201d\u201cAlright. Is there anything else to be concerned about?\u201d\u201cNot right now.\u201d\u201cStill, remain vigilant.\u201d\u201cWhen did you see me not being vigilant? Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cYou know that I believe in you a lot, right?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201dThe conversation between the two ended like that.There were still many things they wanted to talk about, but other people came in so their conversation was cut off.\u201cDanju oraboni!\u201dIt was Heo Ran-ju who came in greeting Zhang Mu-ryang with her characteristic lively voice. However, behind Heo Ran-ju\u2019s back, he saw not only Hyeol Seung, but also some new unfamiliar faces.Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s eyes gleamed coldly.It was because he knew that a middle-aged woman who had her one eye covered with an eye patch was Jeonghwa, the second-in-command of the Emei sect.\u00a0There was another woman with an outstanding beauty that greatly overwhelms even Heo Ranju. It was Yong Seol-ran, who was said to have a talent comparable to Woo Gunsang who was recently assassinated.Zhang Mu-ryang loosened his expression, and greeted the people following behind Heo Ran-ju.\u201cYou\u2019ve brought precious guests. Zhang Mu-ryang, the captain of the Black Cloud Mercenary Groups, greets the distinguished members of the Emei sect.\u201d\u201cJeonghwa of the Emei sect.\u201dJeonghwa answered in a cold voice. Her eyes, looking at Zhang Mu-ryang, were full of energy.It was not of her own will that Jeonghwa came here. She was only here because their sect leader, Guhwasata, understood the power of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group and hence, ordered them to recruit them if they turned out to be useful.\u00a0The woman who was beside Jeonghwa was the next person to introduce herself.\u201cMy name is Yong Seol-ran.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard the name of Yong Seol-ran a lot. You\u2019re beautiful as the rumors say.\u201d\u201cYou are too kind. Anyway, it\u2019s nice to see you.\u201dZhang Mu-ryang couldn\u2019t help but admire Yong Seol-ran\u2019s calm words.\u2018Yong Seol-ran of the Emei sect is said to be the best, but even the rumors could not even come close to describing the real thing.\u2019With her beauty, countless men would be willing to risk their lives for her.\u00a0However, for some reason, Yong Seol-ran always stayed in the Emei sect and did not go out.While Yong Seol-ran\u2019s beauty was undeniable, Zhang Mu-ryang still did not take his eyes off Jeong-hwa. Jeonghwa was radiating a blade-like momentum without hiding it.Her momentum was terrifying since she was the second in command of the Emei sect. The amount of pressure she gave off was enough to make an impression on Zhang Mu-ryang.\u2018If the pressure that comes off from a great disciple is already like this, how much force does Guhwasata or the Three Monks of White Moon1\u00a0possess?\u201dThe Three Monks of White Moon were twice as strong as those of the Guhwasata, and were hiding in Baekryeonam, which was located in a remote part of \u200b\u200bMount Emei.After the Guhwasata, the Abbess of Nine Calamities, became the sect leader, they stopped paying attention to world affairs and entered closed-door training.\u00a0Looking at Jeonghwa, Zhang Mu-ryang felt the power of a prestigious sect again.Zhang Mu-ryang carefully spoke to Jeonghwa.\u201cSince a great disciple of the Emei sect has come in person, is it okay to take this as a sign that the Emei sect\u00a0 is willing to do business with us?\u201d\u201cIt will depend on the outcome of our negotiations. If you dare deceive our sect, we will postpone the war with the Qingcheng sect and the Black Cloud Mercenary Group will pay a heavy price.\u201d\u201cOf course, we are prepared for that.\u201dA smile appeared on the corner of Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s lips.Although they were far behind the Emei sect, the power of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group could still not be taken lightly.Of the three hundred and fifty men, only fifty could be called masters, but among the remaining martial artists, as many as two hundred were from outside the country. Their power of collective warfare can rival that of the Emei and Qingcheng sect.\u00a0Jeonghwa\u2019s eyes grew colder at Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s confidence.She might have only one eye left, but the glow in her eyes grew much more intense than before. As a result, her martial arts level had risen dramatically.Zhang Mu-ryang bowed his head slightly and said,\u201cThen should we try to set the conditions now? Let\u2019s head inside.\u201dHe stayed up all night, but he didn\u2019t feel tired at all. In order to get the best results, he needed to be more alert and mindful from now on.* * *Even after Go Dosa returned, Pyo-wol remained in Jintang County while observing the Thunder gates\u00a0 and collecting information.In the meantime, Nam Ho-san, the rumored young master of the Thunder gates, has never appeared even once outside.\u00a0Information on him was severely limited. He hasn\u2019t gone outside lately, so there wasn\u2019t much to find out. Furthermore, he could not ask other people directly for information about him or the current state of affairs of the sects.Because of that, it was difficult to dig out information about him.He could have stayed like this for a few more days and continue to collect information, but it would be a waste to spend his time like that.Time was never on the side of Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol slightly changed the features of his face.\u00a0Just by touching his face little by little, his mood made a complete turn of a hundred and eighty degrees. Pyo-wol changed into a light jacket and wore the iron sword he had bought in advance on his waist.\u00a0When night came, he went through the alleyway to the west and approached the vicinity of the Thunder gates.The appearance of Pyo-wol was no different from that of other ordinary warriors. People living in residential areas didn\u2019t think it was strange to see Pyo-wol.This is because many martial artists lived in residential areas, and their atmosphere and vibe matches with Pyo-wol. They consider Pyo-wol as one of them, which is a person living in a residential area.Pyo-wol proudly crossed the residential area and arrived at the western wall of the Thunder gates. After confirming that there were no people around, Pyo-wol lightly jumped onto the fence.As he climbed over the wall, the interior of the Thunder Gates came into view.The inside of the Thunder Gates was well organized as he expected.Fortifications and gates were effectively placed to defend against external enemies. The security was also strict, with numerous torches lit everywhere and soldiers standing guard.No matter who manages the inside of the Thunder Gates, there were almost no blind spots due to the exquisite location of the martial artists.The security system was so perfect that no martial artists could even dare to try to infiltrate the Thunder Gates.\u00a0However, Pyo-wol did not believe in the word perfection.It was Pyo-wol who has a history of assassinating Woo Gunsang by breaking through the inescapable net of the Qingcheng sect.No matter how perfect a system was, in the end it was up to humans to operate it. And he knew better than anyone that human concentration never lasts.Especially at night, after standing on alert for a long time, the attention of the soldiers would easily be disturbed.In fact, Pyo-wol could see that the soldiers standing were somehow slacking off. Their faces showed a sense of conceit, since they don\u2019t think anyone would dare to infiltrate the Thunder Gates.\u201cHaa!\u201dThe man closest to the fence let out a yawn. The yawn spread to those who were standing nearby.Pyo-wol did not miss the opening and flew away. Pyo-wol, who infiltrated the interior like this, immediately found a residence of Nam Ho-san.Although this was the first time he had entered the Thunder Gates, Pyo-wol already identified the abode of Nam Ho-san.The conversations of the unsuspecting merchants who trade with the Thunder gates, gave him a clue about where Nam Ho-san was staying.\u2018It was called Geumjujeon.2\u2018The hall was made of golden pillars, hence its name of Geumjujeon. The halls weren\u2019t actually made of gold but rather, were made of similar materials that shine similarly like gold.Pyo-wol could tell the owner\u2019s tendencies and inclinations just by looking at the residence.From that point of view, Nam Ho-san, the rumored master of the Thunder gates, had a strong bravado and was sensitive to external gaze. He was a lecherous man, flirting with Woo Seonha regardless of the circumstances within his clan.It wasn\u2019t too difficult to find the Geumjujeon. Because even in the dark, the pillars were shining like gold because of the illumination of the torches.\u201dThe problem was how to approach him secretly.As it is the residence of a young master, an iron-clad security network had been established in the perimeter. Dozens of martial artists surrounded the area, guarding Nam Ho-san.Their gazes were directed in different directions.Pyo-wol analyzed the directions in which their eyes were facing one by one. And he found the only space where their gaze did not reach.Pyo-wol moved towards the space he had found.It was a very strange sight.There are obviously dozens of warriors, but none of them were aware of the existence of Pyo-wol. Pyo-wol\u2019s walking in the blind spot of human beings.While the human eye is very precise and delicate, it also contains many loopholes.The human eye is divided into the main eye and the auxiliary eye. It is common to see the field of view with the main eye and assist with the auxiliary eye. For that reason, the eye that became the auxiliary vision had no choice but to lose its thrust.It would initially seem that a person could see everything with his two eyes facing the front, but that wasn\u2019t the case at all. The part that humans looked at attentively was only a fraction of the field of vision.Pyo-wol digs into that point. There, he used his fine sense and synchronization at the same time.He used his fine senses to figure out where the other\u2019s gaze was headed, and he used synchronization to make them feel uncomfortable.For that reason, the soldiers were not aware at all even though Pyo-wol was approaching openly. If there were more people or they were scattered more chaotically, Pyo-wol would never have used this method.Because the probability of success was not so high.It was a technique worth trying only when such special circumstances and special conditions were met.When Pyo-wol reached the distance of the soldiers, he took a meandering path and passed by them.Thrack!Just like a snake flowing down a wall, Pyo-wol passed through the soldiers without leaving a trace.It made the eyes of many people useless.\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cDid something just pass?\u201dBelatedly, people felt a sense of incongruity and closed their eyes.\u00a0But by that time, Pyo-wol had already passed them and disappeared.Enjoy reading!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was clear that they did not pay attention to the inside as compared to the outside where the security was so thorough.\u00a0Pyo-wol raised his senses as he stood in the middle of the Geumjujeon.Only one breathing sound could be heard in the fairly wide front wing. The breath flowing through the darkness gave Pyo-wol the exact location.Pyo-wol moved to the place where the sound of breathing could be heard. It was the most splendid room in the Geumjujeon.Furniture that must have been made by a craftsman filled the room.And in the middle was a man sitting cross-legged.Nam Ho-san, the rumored owner of the Thunder gates, was a man with a handsome appearance and a well-rounded body. Except for the corners of his eyes which were raised nervously, there was hardly anything else to see.\u00a0He didn\u2019t even know that the assassin had been hiding, and he was just focusing on feeling his qi.With each breath, the color of his face changed. Sometimes it was red, and sometimes it was blue. Then it turned to gold again.\u00a0It was truly out of the ordinary.The cultivation techniques of the prestigious sects puts stability first. Martial arts, whose keynote changes in such an instant, are bound to be excluded from the beginning.The fact that he learned this kind of cultivation meant that the Thunder sect was an orthodox sect.Pyo-wol\u2019s eyes who was looking at Nam Ho-san did not contain any emotion.He walked a meandering path and approached Nam Ho-san. Even though Pyo-wol came close, Nam Ho-san did not notice at all and was passionate about cultivating.Sreung!Pyo-wol raised his sword loudly.At that moment, Nam Ho-san opened his eyes.The appearance of a stranger holding a sword in front of him gave a sense of urgency.The cultivation method he was practicing was Soroeumsa\u2019s Five Elements of Vajrapani.1By training and maximizing the energy of the five elements, you will be able to use the method of the Five Elements of Vajrapani.It was a technique that even a rock the size of a house could be turned into powder at once. For a long time, he was facing an important turning point, so he could not stop. If it was forcibly stopped, his internal qi would experience an imbalance which could lead to serious internal injuries.Knowing that fact, Pyo-wol was not in a hurry.He used his sword to stab Nam Ho-san\u2019s heart. In an instant, Nam Ho-san was forced to stop his cultivation and flew backwards.Puk!Blood bursted out of his mouth.This was the normal reaction when one\u2019s cultivation is forcibly stopped.Knowing that if he continues to let his cultivation be interrupted like this, he will experience qi deviation, so Nam Ho-san kept his mouth shut and tried to control his inner qi.Pyo-wol followed the retreating Nam Ho-san like a shadow.\u00a0Shishk!A wave-like sword strike swept through him one after another.\u201cKeuk!\u201dNam Ho-san opened the art of the Thunder gates with his lips closed. However, because his body was a mess, his martial arts did not show his original power.Because he forced himself to perform martial arts, his complexion turned white and the blood vessels in his eyes were all drained.He wanted to ask the intruder about his identity. However, he could not open his mouth because of the rampaging internal energy.His footwork became twisted and his movements were a mess.Cit! Ciiit!Pyo-wol left a deep gash on Nam Ho-san\u2019s body. His flesh and bones were seen all at once, and blood splashed all over the place.Nam Ho-san was drenched in his blood in an instant.\u201cYou! Bastard! Who, who are you?\u201dNam Ho-san squeezed his last energy and asked Pyo-wol.\u00a0He was genuinely curious.About his opponent\u2019s identity.The reason why he has to die.He didn\u2019t want to die without knowing why.Because that would be a dog\u2019s death.Puk!At that moment, Pyo-wol\u2019s sword pierced his neck.Nam Ho-san\u2019s eyes rolled back in extreme pain.That was the end of Nam Hosan.Even at the moment of his death, he couldn\u2019t ask Pyo-wol the reason why.\u00a0Pyo-wol quietly looked at the body of Nam Hosan, which collapsed like a sandcastle. The countless scars he left behind Nam Ho-san\u2019s body were clearly visible.It was then that Pyo-wol felt a presence outside.\u00a0The soldiers who heard the sound of Pyo-wol and Nam Ho-san fighting came running in an instant. Pyo-wol exited the room before they arrived.\u201cYoung master, are you okay?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dThe soldiers who arrived in front of the room asked about the well-being of Nam Ho-san. But no matter how much they asked, they received no answer. So the warriors opened the door and entered.\u201cYoung master!\u201d\u201cOh God! Young master has been assassinated!\u201dThe soldiers cried out.Biic! Biiic!An emergency whistle rang through the Thunder gates.\u00a0 The soldiers, who were sleeping deeply, woke up and immediately searched the area.\u00a0But they were too late. Pyo-wol had already left the Geumjujeon.Inside the Thunder gates, all of the personnel were mobilized to catch the unidentified assassin. The nearby military officials were also asked for their cooperation. Even retired martial artists in the Geumjujeon moved.\u00a0However, the assassin who killed Nam Ho-san was never found.No one saw the face of the assassin, let alone his identity.\u00a0Like a ghost, the assassin disappeared from the Geumjujeon.\u201cUgh!\u201dTae Yeon-ho, the master of the Thunder Gates, clenched his fists and looked at Nam Ho-san\u2019s dead body lying in front of him.His two eyes were bloodshot.The death of his one and only disciple made him angry.\u201cHosanna.\u201dHe approached Nam Ho-san\u2019s body.The condition of the body was dire. Countless swords were engraved on Nam Ho-san\u2019s body. Like a stigma.Tae Yeon-ho looked closely at Namho-san\u2019s wounds. The martial artists in the Thunder gates looked at Tae Yeon-ho while holding their breath.Tae Yeon-ho, who had been examining the body for a long time, muttered.\u201cQingcheng sect! How dare those guys kill my disciple?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean? Qingcheng sect?\u201d\u201cThe sword image engraved on Ho-san\u2019s body only appears when he is struck by the Seventy-Two Sword Waves, a technique of the Qingcheng sect.\u201d\u201cThat can\u2019t be!\u201d\u201cThis sword image only appears when struck by the Seventy-Two Sword Waves. It is so unique that it cannot be imitated by any other sect.\u201dTae Yeon-ho trembled in anger. His eyes were full of malice.In Sichuan, the Thunder gates could not be said to be the strongest. It was the Qingcheng and Emei sect who could be said to be the leading factions which was why he could not help but give those two sects his attention. He did so by taking note of their martial arts.\u00a0\u201cDid someone else imitate the Seventy-Two Swords?\u201d\u201cThe Seventy-Two Sword Waves is a sword technique that only verified disciples within the Qingcheng sect can learn. The probability of it leaking outside is extremely rare. Even if someone from the outside has learned it, it is absolutely impossible to learn it to this level by themselves.\u201d\u201cIs it really the Qingcheng sect?\u201d\u201cMaybe after realizing that we were trying to support the Emei sect through our marriage to the White Flower Room, the Qingcheng sect chose to make their move first.\u201dTae Yeon-ho decided that the Qingcheng was bad water, but his subordinates were rather careful.\u201cHowever, to conclude that the Qingcheng sect is bad water\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s the Qingcheng sect. They\u2019ve always thought of our sect as a thorn in their eyes. Just because we\u2019re a branch from Soreoeumsa. Of course, we are closely related to Soreoeumsa, but it\u2019s just not right for us to be treated like this.\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cGet Ho-san\u2019s body. We will climb Qingcheng Mountain right away.\u201d\u201cSect leader?\u201d\u201cI will show Hosan\u2019s body to the Qingcheng sect, and ask them. Why was your sword technique found on Hosan\u2019s body?\u201dEveryone held their breath.No one dared to stop Tae Yeon-ho, who was furious. It was because it was clear that he would go out and see blood at this time. More than anything else, they were also outraged by Nam Ho-san\u2019s death.In any case, Nam Ho-san was the young master of the Thunder gates. He was never supposed to die in such a vain way.* * *\u201cCheeky! You want me to surrender the foreign trade rights? Do you think that makes sense?\u201d\u201cIf the Emei sect becomes the loser of Sichuan, it seems that it will be possible though?\u201d\u201cIf you are a mercenary, you should be rewarded with money like a mercenary. You are too greedy.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s too much, do you?\u201dBang!In response to Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s answer, Jeonghwa slammed the table with her palm. The table, made of thick rosewood, split in two in an instant and collapsed to both sides.If her hand had hit Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s head rather than the table, his skull would have been crushed and he would have died.Of course, Zhang Mu-ryang had no intention of being taken lightly. However, if the confrontation intensified, it was a great loss not only to the Emei sect, but also to the Black Cloud Mercenary Group.He had to take a step back from this.\u201cOkay. If you say yes, we will yield the new foreign trade rights. We will also not accept the half a million yuan payment. Instead, help us settle down near the Western Highlands.\u201d\u201cIs that really what you were aiming for? Getting a place to settle down?\u201d\u201cAs you know, we are a gang of mercenaries. No sect wants us to settle nearby.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the same with our sect.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re going to settle down near the Western Highlands, which is far from the Emei sect. Can\u2019t you tolerate that much?\u201d\u201cHmm!\u201dJeonghwa crossed her arms and looked at Zhang Mu-ryang.Zhang Mu-ryang looked at her without avoiding her gaze.The right to trade with Saebae was literally the right to trade with Saebae.A large clan, like the Qingcheng sect or the Emei sect, is likely to have relationships with numerous upper classes. In the upper classes of which they have a close relationship, they secretly look behind them so that they can trade with other forces, which is called the Sae-Oe trade zone.The money earned by the merchants using the foreign trade rights was enormous. The money could never be given to someone else because it served as the source for the Qingcheng and Emei sect.Zhang Mu-ryang knew that too.From the beginning, he did not have a great desire for the foreign trade zone. Still, the reason he had to mention it was to obtain an area where the Black Cloud Mercenary Group could settle.None of Jianghu\u2019s sects want a group of mercenaries to settle near them. As such, the eyes of the Jainghu looking at the mercenaries were not pretty.Jeonghwa had to think about it for a long time.Normally, she would never have listened to Zhang Mu-ryang, but their situation right now is not good. If even one person lacked power, it would have been a great help if the power was comparable to that of the Black Cloud Mercenary Groups.\u00a0The problem was that if they accepted them, they would only be useful now. But in the future, they would be a big burden.It was clear that the Black Cloud Mercenary Group would be a similar burden, as was the case with the Thunder Gate located in Sichuan Province.\u2018If they become a problem in the future, we can solve it then. It won\u2019t be a big deal now if we give them a place to settle.\u2019Jeonghwa finished all her calculations in an instant.\u201cOkay. I will accept your offer.\u201d\u201cThen the negotiations are complete.\u201d\u201cYes. I promise you with the honor of the Emei sect.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201dA smile crept on the corner of Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s lips.Once they were able to settle in one area, earning huge sums of money would be easy. Zhang Mu-ryang had already done the preliminary work.\u00a0\u2018Good! If I had tried to sign a contract with the Qingcheng sect, I would not have been able to negotiate so easily.\u2019The Qingcheng sect was not as desperate as the Emei sect. After all, their power was superior to that of the Emei. Therefore, it would not have been easy for Zhang Mu-ryang to meet his desired conditions.In fact, there has been no contact from Yang Woo-jung, who was sent to the Qingcheng sect. This meant that negotiations were sluggish.\u2018As long as the negotiations with the Emei sect are complete, I will have to make Yang Woo-jung return.\u2019From now on, the Qingcheng sect was not the subject of negotiations. They were now an enemy that had to be defeated after joining forces with the Emei sect.Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s gaze turned to Yong Seol-ran who is beside Jeong-hwa.Yong Seol-ran didn\u2019t say a word after entering the room.As if Jeonghwa\u2019s negotiations had nothing to do with her, she had an indifferent attitude. However, Jeonghwa did not blame Yong Seol-ran at all.Even before, Yong Seol-ran was already famous for her lack of interest in worldly affairs even within the Emei sect.The only thing she was interested in was practicing martial arts. Her obsession of staying inside the training room and learning martial arts was famous even within the Emei sect.The only person who knew Yong Seol-ran\u2019s true growth was her master, Guhwasata.Zhang Mu-ryang was curious about the capabilities of Yong Seol-ran.No, he was very interested in the woman named Yong Seol-ran herself.Yong Seol-ran\u2019s beauty was so great that it moved the heart of Zhang Mu-ryang, who did not feel anything with Heo Ran-ju.Even though he was a little older, when he looked at her, he could feel her heart pounding. Yong Seol-ran didn\u2019t spare Zhang Mu-ryang a glance despite feeling his gaze.Zhang Mu-ryang asked, trying to hide his bitter heart,\u201cAre you two going to return to the Emei sect right away? If you stay for a day, we\u2019ll give you a room on our side.\u201d\u201cWe will stay in the White Flower Room.\u201d\u201cWhite Flower Room?\u201d\u201cIt is a place that is no different from the sect of the main family. The leader there is my niece.\u201d\u201cOh, I see.\u201dZhang Mu-ryang gave a sad expression.It was time for Jeonghwa to get up from her seat with a snort.\u201cDanju! It\u2019s urgent.\u201dOutside, Heo Ran-ju\u2019s hurried voice was heard.\u00a0 She ran into the room without waiting for Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s permission. Zhang Mu-ryang frowned and scolded her.\u201cDon\u2019t you know that no matter how urgent it is, you shouldn\u2019t come in like this? You f\u2013\u201d\u201cThe young master of the Thunder Gates was assassinated.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dInstead of reprimanding her, Zhang Mu-ryang stood up in surprise.It was the same with Jeonghwa and Yong Seol-ran.\u201cHow? No, was the assassin caught?\u201d\u201cNo! But I think the Thunder Gates is convinced that it is the work of the Qingcheng sect. They say that the Thunder Gate\u2019s sect leader is now headed to the Qingcheng sect with the corpse of Nam Ho-san.*In response to Heo Ran-ju\u2019s reply, Zhang Mu-ryang looked at Jeonghwa and Yong Seol-ran.The two were the most bewildered by the series of events.\u00a0Even Yong Seol-ran showed her emotions.\u201cAn assassin?\u201dA fire broke out in Jeonghwa\u2019s one and only eye.Enjoy reading!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 57": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 57Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayRumors that Nam Ho-san had been assassinated spread throughout Sichuan.\u00a0Everyone living in Chengdu knew that the Qingcheng sect did not like the Thunder Gates, but no one expected such a sudden move. Especially at a time when tensions with the Emei sect are escalating at a rapid pace.\u00a0So many people thought this incident was unexpected.For this reason, some people thought that the Qingcheng sect was not behind the incident. Instead, they considered the possibility that the Emei sect could have ordered the assasination.Whatever the truth, the assassination of the young master of the Thunder Gates stirred the entire Sichuan Province.But the person who was most bewildered by this news was the White Flower Room\u2019s Woo Seolha.\u00a0\u201cHe was really assassinated? And the mastermind is the Qingcheng sect? How could this have happened?\u201dShe was obviously the one who asked Pyo-wol to kill Nam Ho-san. As far as she knew, Pyo-wol had nothing to do with the Qingcheng sect. But how come it was said that Nam Ho-san was assassinated by someone who used the Qingcheng sect\u2019s martial arts?\u201cSo he wasn\u2019t the one who killed him?\u201dHer mind was in a complicated mess.If it is true that Pyo-wol killed Nam Ho-san, then that would mean that Pyo-wol was affiliated with the Qingcheng sect.\u00a0But would a person connected with the Qingcheng sect kill a person like Nam Ho-san knowing that it will harm his own sect?\u00a0Intuitively, it didn\u2019t make sense.\u201cWhat the hell happened\u2014\u201dSeolha shook her head. It was too much for her brain to come up with an explanation for the recent events.\u00a0Everything turned out to be good.\u00a0She doesn\u2019t know if it was Pyo-wol or someone else who killed Nam Ho-san. But nonetheless, what is important is that her troubles are gone.If the Thunder Gates caused a conflict with the Qingcheng sect, it would be good news for the Emei sect.\u201cHmn~\u201dWith her mood improving, she hummed.\u00a0That was then.\u201cSect leader! A guest has arrived from the Emei sect.\u201dA voice was heard outside.\u201cGuest?\u201d\u201cYes! You\u2019ll need to come out and see.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dSeolha went out in a hurry. Seeing the visitor\u2019s face, a wide smile immediately appeared on Seolha\u2019s face.\u201cAunt!\u201dIt was Jeonghwa who visited the White Flower Room without warning.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while. How have you been?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m alright.\u201dSeolha rested in the arms of Jeonghwa. Jeonghwa only patted Seolha on the back and smiled.It was a warm smile that she never showed to any of the Emei\u2019s disciples or outsiders. Even Yong Seol-ran, who usually accompanies her, had never seen such a soft expression from Jeonghwa.\u00a0Jeonghwa introduced Yong Seol-ran to Seonha.\u201cThis is my youngest junior sister, Yong Seol-ran. Say hello.\u201d\u201cThe White Flower Room\u2019s Seolha greets you. Sister Yong Seol-ran!\u201d\u201cLong time no see. How have you been?\u201d\u201cHo-ho! Thanks to you, I\u2019m doing very well.\u201dJeonghwa tilted her head at Seolha\u2019s laugh.\u201cDid something good happen?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just in good shape. But what is aunt doing here?\u201d\u201cI came down for work and stopped by for a while. I was originally planning to go back to the main sect right away, but I\u2019ll have to stay here for a while.\u201d\u201cIs it because of the Thunder gates as well?\u201d\u201cYes, their young master has been assassinated. While this piece of news is a good thing for us, it\u2019s suspicious that something like this happened all of a sudden.\u201dJeonghwa\u2019s one and only eye shone sharply.Just because this incident is bad for the Qingcheng sect, it doesn\u2019t automatically mean that it would be a good thing for the Emei sect.In particular, in the case of a case with a large ripple effect like this one, they had to analyze it more closely to find out the truth behind it. So, she and Yong Seol-ran planned to stay in the White Flower Room for a while to keep a close eye on the situation.\u201cDo you know anything about this case?\u201d\u201cHm? Me?\u201d\u201cSince you\u2019re in Chengdu, you must be well aware of the situation in the area, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cI wish I knew, but I don\u2019t know about this either.\u201dSeolha denied having any involvement with the incident.There was no guarantee that Pyo-wol really killed Nam Ho-san, and there was nothing good about them knowing that she had slept with him by mistake.Fortunately, Jeonghwa nodded without any doubt.\u201cTrue, what do you know? But from now on, you must use all the information networks of the White Flower Room to find out the truth. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cGreat!\u201dJeonghwa smiled softly and stroked Seolha\u2019s hair. Seolha felt a little guilty.But the feeling soon dissipated.* * *Pyo-wol returned to Chengdu.The iron sword and clothes he used to assassinate Nam Ho-san were disposed of on the way.When Pyo-wol was looking around to go a guest house, suddenly,\u00a0\u201cWait, who is that? Isn\u2019t that your handsome oraboni?\u201dSuddenly a familiar voice was heard.When Pyo-wol turned his head to look, Heo Ran-joo was approaching with quick steps. Heo Ran-joo was smiling at the fact that she met Pyo-wol by chance.\u201cGo Dosa said that he met you at Jintang County. When did you come back?\u201d\u201cJust now.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dHeo Ran-ju glanced up and down Pyo-wol with narrowed eyes.\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d\u201cWere you with another woman in Jintang County? If you did, tell me honestly. My heart is wide enough that I don\u2019t get jealous.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re just going to say nonsense, then shut up..\u201dAt Pyo-wol\u2019s cold words, Heo Ran-ju had a wounded expression on her face.\u201cHyuk! You\u2019re the first man to say this to me, my heart\u2026\u201d\u00a0Pyo-wol walked past Heo Ran-ju, who pretended to grab her chest. Then, Heo Ran-ju hurriedly followed Pyo-yol.\u201cReally! You\u2019re so rude\u2026 You\u2019re leaving just like that?\u201d\u201cThen why did you go to Jintang County? Did something happen?\u201dHeo Ran-ju was really curious.Go Dosa said he had assigned Maun as a watchdog to Pyo-wol. However, when Maun went to Jintang County, Pyo-wol had already disappeared. Because of that, Maun returned in vain without seeing Pyo-wol\u2019s back.However, while Pyo-wol was staying in Jintang County, Nam Ho-san was assassinated.To most people, it was rumored that the incident happened because of the Qingcheng sect, but Heo Ran-ju and Zhang Mu-ryang did not believe the rumors.If there was even the slightest doubt, they had to dig into it tenaciously.Heo Ran-ju did not believe that Pyo-wol was the assassin that killed Nam Ho-san, but she doubted whether he was involved in the series of events.\u201cDidn\u2019t the Go Dosa tell you? That I went there for personal reasons?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m curious what your personal business is.\u201d\u201cYou definitely lack manners because you\u2019re a mercenary. When something\u2019s personal, it means it is something that can\u2019t be told to anyone else.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dIn an instant, Heo Ran-ju\u2019s eyebrows rose to the sky.She has heard many times that she has a good personality, but this is the first time she\u2019s heard that she lacked manners in person. That\u2019s also because she picked up the word mercenary.\u00a0\u201cHa! This is pretty funny. I was nice to you because you\u2019re handsome. Do I look easy? Is that why?\u201dFrost-like momentum radiated from Heo Ran-ju\u2019s whole body.Although she usually acts coquettish and smiles, her strength is not inferior to that of Jianghu\u2019s famous masters. On the contrary, in practical terms, she was even superior.\u2018Those with handsome faces like this only have their appearance to back them up. They are easier to deal with when I break their spirits from the very beginning.\u2019Heo Ran-ju wanted to take this opportunity to correct Pyo-wol\u2019s habit. She liked Pyo-wol. Since she likes him, she wants to rip him off the way she wants.Heo Ran-ju said with both hands wide open,\u201cI\u2019ll give you three seconds, so come on. By the way, you\u2019d better do your best, because after three seconds, I won\u2019t even look at you.\u201dIt was something she could say because she was confident in her power. Her position as the\u00a0 Vice-Captain of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group was not obtained for free. It was acquired through her skill.Heo Ran-ju smiled as Pyo-wol slightly frowned.\u201cWhy are you scared?\u201dHowever, at the next moment, Heo Ran-ju\u2019s eyes shook. Pyo-wol suddenly appeared in front of her. There was a distance of three or four steps between her and Pyo-wol. However, without her realizing it, Pyo-wol was already right in front of her.Heo Ran-ju was so surprised that she couldn\u2019t even speak and her eyes widened.\u201cWh, what?\u201dShe let down her guard and tried to attack Pyo-wol. She was so surprised that she had forgotten her promise of giving him a handicapped.\u00a0Jjoeng!At that moment, Pyo-wol stabbed Heo Ran-ju\u2019s abdomen with his index finger. Heo Ran-ju felt a huge shock in her abdomen. The shock immediately spread through her whole body like a wave, and she collapsed while suppressing her screams.\u00a0When the pain reached its peak, she realized that she could not even let a scream come out.She couldn\u2019t breathe properly. Her body stiffened to the point that she couldn\u2019t even move.\u00a0Her head went blank. She couldn\u2019t even think of anything.The excruciating pain that dominated her entire body made it impossible for her to wonder how Pyo-wol shortened the distance or what technique he used to attack.Pyo-wol looked down at Heo Ran-ju, who had her entire body stiffened in pain.\u201cYou still want to give up three seconds?\u201d\u201cKeukkeuk!\u2019Heo Ran-ju vomited blood.Heo Ran-ju looked up at Pyo-wol with an expression as if saying that she was deceived. She had initially guessed that Pyo-wol had mastered martial arts, but she didn\u2019t know that he was hiding such a tremendous force.She felt like she was being deceived by Pyo-Wol.\u2018Rain, cowardly.Her face was horribly contorted.It was painful and even shameful.The last thing Pyo-wol said before turning around was,\u201cThe next time you say something like that, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201dHeo Ran-ju trembled as if she was splashed by cold water. Pyo-wol\u2019s words did not feel like a mere threat.\u2018I was wrong! Pyo-wol is stronger than I thought.\u2019Heo Ran-ju\u2019s eyes shone sharply as she looked at Pyo-wol\u2019s back as he walked away. Although she was devastated by an unexpected blow, she did not consider herself defeated.The thing she is most confident about is that her whip-wielding expedient is not like a wooden ball.Of course, that didn\u2019t mean the filthy feeling went away.\u201cIt\u2019s rotten! It hurts terribly.\u201dHeo Ran-ju stared at the back of Pyo-wol\u2019s head for a long time. Pyo-wol ignored Heo Ran-ju\u2019s gaze from behind and moved on.He initially thought about stopping Heo Ran-ju\u2019s breathing. However, he refrained from doing so because it seemed that there would be more harm than good.By killing Nam Ho-san, the clash of the Thunder Gates and Qingcheng sect was brought about, but there was no need to get people\u2019s attention by killing Heo Ran-ju.Pyo-wol found a guest house with an empty room.The place he found was Song Guest House. As the name suggests, it was a guest house run by a man having a Song surname. The size of the guest house is not very large, but since it was recently built, all facilities were clean.After getting a clean isolated room, Pyo-wol ate on the first floor.On the first floor, quite a few people were gathering and eating. All of their topics by far were about Nam Ho-san.\u201cDid the Qingcheng sect really kill Nam Ho-san?\u201d\u201cWasn\u2019t there a trace of the Qingcheng sect\u2019s martial arts on Namhosan\u2019s body?\u201d\u201cIt can be imitated, right?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean? I heard that the more difficult the technique, the more unique traces it would leave. Such traces can never be imitated.\u201d\u201cThen you mean that the Qingcheng sect is really at fault? Why would they when they\u2019re in a situation like this?\u201d\u201cWho knows?\u201d\u201cWhoo! Let\u2019s just drink.\u201dPeople raised their glasses with anxious faces. Numerous other stories have been told. Pyo-wol listened to all the stories while eating.The little information he heard like this helped him a lot.That was then.\u201cOh! Did you hear that story?\u201d\u201cWhat story?\u201d\u201cI heard that the Emei sect\u2019s Jeonghwa and the Yong Seol-ran have entered Chengdu.\u201d\u201cReally? Did those two really come to Chengdu?\u201d\u201cYeah! A lot of people have already seen them.\u201d\u201cHuh! So they even come down from their main sect. This is really unusual.\u201d\u201cRight?\u201dIn an instant, Pyo-wol\u2019s chopsticks stopped. It was because of the names Jeonghwa and Yong Seol-ran. There were several names in his life that he would never forget, two of which were Jeonghwa and Yong Seol-ran.In many ways, their names were deeply engraved in Pyo-wol\u2019s memory.Not knowing if Pyo-wol was listening, the men continued to talk.\u201cFor what purpose did they come to Chengdu?\u201d\u201cHow would I know that? I heard that they came to meet someone from the White Flower Room.\u201d\u00a0\u201cWhite Flower Room? That\u2019s right! The White Flower Room is no different from the Emei sect. Maybe it\u2019s a standpoint that came out to crack down on the sect faction.\u2019After that, there was a lot of nonsensical chatter.Pyo-wol also turned his attention away from their conversation and fell into a world of his own.\u2018Jeonghwa and Yong Seol-ran came here?\u2019Pyo-wol thought that things were going more interesting than expected.It seemed that the work he did caused a bigger issue than he initially thought.Pyo-wol\u2019s white teeth were exposed through red lips.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The people who climbed Mount Qingcheng carrying a coffin with the body were Tae Yeon-ho and the martial artists of the Thunder Gates.\u00a0The warriors of the Qingcheng sect looked displeased at the martial artists who visited without notice. It was not considered polite in Jianghu to make such a sudden visit with another sect without a message in advance.\u00a0Much less, the Qingcheng sect is a sacred sect with ties to Taoism.There was no reason to allow a group with swords to enter without permission. However, the matter was so urgent that the Qingcheng sect had no choice but to let in the martial artist of the Thunder Gates.\u00a0They are now facing each other in a big hall in front of the great Daejeon.In the middle between the Qingcheng sect and the Thunder Gates, there was an Ongwan held from the bottom of the mountain.At that time, the top leaders walked out from Daejeon. As they appeared, the warriors of the Qingcheng sect bowed their heads.In the center of the leadership was Muryeongjin, the sect leader of the Qingcheng sect.Muryeongjin looked at Tae Yeon-ho with clear eyes and said,\u201cWhat do you mean by this, sect leader Tae?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I wanted to ask, sect leader Muryeongjin.\u201d\u201cTell me what happened. Why did you bring a coffin to the sect?\u201d\u201cIn this coffin is the body of my disciple.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that sect leader Tae\u2019s disciple died, but I don\u2019t think this has anything to do with our sect.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t know?!\u201dTae Yeon-ho opened his eyes and looked at Muryeongjin. At that, the disciples of the Qingcheng sect were furious.\u201cShow some respect!\u201d\u201cHow dare you persecute the sect leader of our Qingcheng sect!\u201dThe disciples of the Qingcheng sect had the momentum to attack the martial artists of the Thunder Gates at any moment. This was the home of the Qingcheng sect, so their power and numbers were superior.If the Qingcheng sect wanted to, they were capable of subduing all of the martial artists of the Thunder gates who came up here in a hurry.Nevertheless, the reason why Muryeongjin and the rest of the disciples keep their manners is because of their roots as a Taoist.Muryeongjin raised his hand to calm down the agitated disciples. He then asked Tae Yeon-ho,\u201cI really don\u2019t have any idea what you\u2019re talking about.. Can you explain to me what happened?\u201dAs the news of Nam Ho-san\u2019s assassination had not yet been reported to the Qingcheng sect, Muryeongjin did not know why Tae Yeon-ho was making such a fuss.\u201cOkay. Then I\u2019ll show you myself.\u201dTae Yeon-ho opened the coffin lid. Then the body of Nam Ho-san, lying in a miserable state, was revealed.\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cAmitabha Buddha!\u201dThe appearance of a corpse full of terrible sword slashes was enough to shake the hearts of the Qingcheng sect warriors.\u201cThis is the body of my disciple. Do you not feel anything when you see this child?\u201d\u201cI express my deepest condolences to the disciple\u2019s misfortune. But what do we have to do with the disciple\u2019s death?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you see this child\u2019s wound? Even though it\u2019s a wound from the Seventy-Two Sword Waves!\u201d\u201cNo way.\u201dIt was then that the Muryeongjin people and the rest of the department heads took a closer look at the scars left on Nam Ho-san\u2019s body.\u201cHm!\u201d\u201cAre you saying it\u2019s really the Seventy-Two Sword Waves?\u201dThey unknowingly let out a sigh. This was because the scars left on Nam Ho-san\u2019s body were traces that appeared when the Seventy-Two Sword Waves was used.A confused expression appeared on Muryeongjin\u2019s face.\u00a0This is because the Seventy-Two Sword Wave was definitely a technique of the Qingcheng sect.Tae Yeon-ho shouted,\u201cAre you still going to deny it? My disciple was assassinated by an assassin using the Seventy-Two Sword Waves of the Qingcheng sect. This cannot happen without the Qingcheng sect killing him.\u201d\u201cSect leader Tae! Calm down first.\u201d\u201cHow can I calm down? My disciple was killed by the sword of the Qingcheng sect.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll figure this out\u2014\u201d\u201cDo not procrastinate, and give me a proper explanation. Is it because you think that if my disciple marries the Woo Seolha of the White Flower Room, we will be on the side of the Emei sect? Are you worried about the Emei sect that much? Enough to commit such a cowardly thing.\u201dAt the words of Tae Yeon-ho, Muryeongjin\u2019s eyebrows twitched.At that moment, the lion\u2019s hood exploded.\u201cGo!\u201dAfter the huge roar that resounded all over the Qingcheng sect, Tae Yeon-ho and the rest of the Thunder Gates covered their ears and stumbled.At that time, a man with a cold expression jumped out from among the department heads.\u00a0A middle-aged man reduced the space in an instant and appeared in front of Tae Yeon-ho. He was Mu Jeong-jin, the strongest warrior of the Qingcheng sect.\u201dA ferocious light flashed in Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s eyes as he looked at Tae Yeon-ho.Muryeongjin, who saw it, cried out.\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d\u201cHow dare you! I won\u2019t forgive you for barging into our sect and making a fuss!\u201dMu Jeong-jin did not care and extended his hand to Tae Yeon-ho.It was one of the\u00a0 techniques of the Qingcheng sect, Wind Thunder Palm.1\u201cNo!\u201dTae Yeon-ho quickly drew his sword and performed a defensive stance. However, it was not enough to block the sword of Mu Jeong-jin.Bang!Tae Yeon-ho\u2019s body bounced back with the explosion. The sword he was holding split due to the formidable power of the Wind Thunder Palm.\u00a0Mu Jeong-jin jumped and then followed Tae Yeon-ho.Tae Yeon-ho bit his lip at the unfamiliar flashing eyes and fierce momentum.Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s Wind Thunder Palm shook Tae Yeon-ho\u2019s internal organs, so he couldn\u2019t bring out his power.\u201cPriest! Show mercy!\u201d\u201cYou must not kill him, Senior brother!\u201dMuryeongjin and Muhwajin shouted at the same time.At that moment, Mu Jeong Jin-in\u2019s hands pounded Tae Yeon-ho\u2019s whole body.Purberbuck!\u201cGeuh!\u201dTae Yeon-ho screamed and collapsed.Luckily, Mu Jeong-jin controlled his attack, so Tae Yeon-ho did not stop breathing. But Tae yeon-ho\u2019s appearance still looked very miserable. He knelt on the floor filled with his blood.Mu Jeong-jin looked down at Tae Yeon-ho while holding his back.\u201cDo you think our sect is easy? For you to accused us of such absurd manipulation.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t lie.\u201dTae Yeon-ho answered with difficulty. Then, Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s eyes turned even colder.\u201cQuiet. If you talk nonsense again, I will kill not only you, but also everyone who climbed the mountain.\u201dTae Yeon-ho kept his mouth shut at the terrifying threat of Mu Jeong-jin. There was a gloomy expression on his face. When he experienced the formidable power of a Mu Jeong-jin first hand, he couldn\u2019t dare to respond.Clearly, it was the Qingcheng sect who did something wrong, but they were the one being persecuted here. Tears wanted to come out from his heart.Tae Yeon-ho looked at Muryeongjin.\u201cIs this how the Qingcheng sect does things? To suppress others with force so that no objection can be raised?\u201d\u201cI apologize, sect leader Tae!\u201dMuryeongjin hastily tried to make excuses. But before that, Mu Jeong-jin kicked Tae Yeon-ho in the chest.Puck!Taeyeon-ho couldn\u2019t even scream, flew away and lost consciousness.\u201cPriest! Why are you attacking him here? It will not be too late to find out the circumstances first and then act later.\u201d\u201cOnce we subdue it, it is not too late to check the situation. The more we look at the situation, the more they would look at us with ridicule. Amitabha!\u201dMu Jeong-jin replied coldly and went into Daejeon. Muryeongjin looked at his back and murmured.\u201cWhat the hell happened to the priest in the past? He wasn\u2019t that ferocious even though he was cold.\u201dAt some point, Mu Jeong-jin changed little by little. He became ferocious and vicious. And he couldn\u2019t hold back his anger.At first, he thought that Mu Jeong-jin was just going through a simma in the process of learning martial arts. When anyone learns martial arts, they tend to experience a little bit of heart demon2, and most of them escape safely.Qingcheng sect\u2019s martial arts contain the essence of Taoism, so it is especially easy to escape from heart demon. So he didn\u2019t pay much attention to it, but as time went on, the brutality of Mu Jeong-jin was increasing.The problem is that there is no way to control Mu Jeong-jin right now.The martial arts of Mu Jeong-jin could be said to be the best of the Qingcheng sect. In order to control him, it was possible only at the level of Go Yeopjin, an elder from the previous generation. However, he retired a long time ago and it has been a long time since he left the Qingcheng sect.Muryeongjin sighed softly and said to the Muhwajin.\u201cHoo\u2026 Let the priest talk to you as soon as sect leader Tae wakes up. Give them a place to live.\u201d\u201cOkay. Amitabha!\u201dAfter the Muhwajin politely stood up, he approached the members of the Thunder gates.Muhwajin was respected by many for his mild personality. He led those who were angry at Tae Yeon-ho\u2019s injury and took them to their own quarters.\u00a0 In addition, a physician was sent to Tae Yeon-ho to treat him.After the situation seemed to have calmed down to some extent, the Muryeongjin spoke to the nearby master of the Cheongsu Koreansang.\u201cCheongyeop!\u201d\u201cYes! Please give me a command, sect leader.\u201dThe name of the monk who responded politely is Cheongyeop. He was a great disciple of the Qingcheng sect famous for his nickname as the White Sword Crane.3\u201cI think you should go to Chengdu.\u201d\u201cAre you talking about me?\u201d\u201cYes. This situation is unusual. You should take some disciples and check the situation over there.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re struggling, go to Priest Woo and ask for his help. Even though you\u2019re heartbroken and let go of public affairs, I won\u2019t refuse your request.\u201d\u201cI will.\u201dCheongyeop bowed his head.Priest Woo, whom Muryeongjin spoke of, was referring to Woo Jinpyeong.After the death of his son, Woo Jin-pyeong, who made the greatest contribution to the success of the Qingcheng sect, has lost all his motivation and returned to his hometown.Muryeongjin quietly closed his eyes and muttered.\u2018How the hell did things get to this point? Oh Primordial Heaven. Please look over the Qingcheng sect.\u2019His eyes didn\u2019t open for a long time.* * *As night fell, the Song Guest House was as quiet as a dead mouse.This is because many of Song Guest House\u2019s guests just used the restaurant and returned home. There were not many guests who stayed overnight. Thanks to this, Pyo-wol was able to spend time quietly alone.There was only one small lamp illuminating his room.Pyo-wol leaned his back against the wall and looked at the oil lamp swaying. Even with the windows closed, the wind was blowing from somewhere and waving the lanterns.Pyo-wol thought that the oil lamp resembled himself a lot.He lived a precarious life where he can\u2019t even see what\u2019s going to happen. If he wanted to, he could leave Jianghu and live comfortably. With his current ability, it was enough to enjoy a life filled with glory or wealth.Still, Pyo-wol chose revenge.Without hesitating.\u00a0He was arrested at the age of 14 and lived without seeing the light properly for 14 years.He\u2019s been living like an angler in order to somehow survive in a hellish environment where his fellow captives were dying right next to me.For this reason, his emotions and way of thinking were remarkably different from those of ordinary people.Even Pyo-wol knew that fact.\u00a0And he realized one more thing.It\u2019s the fact that he will never be able to live like everyone else.Shruck!At that moment, the sound of someone pulling their skirt was heard in Pyo-wol\u2019s ear.Someone approached his room.Pyo-wol turned his head slightly and looked at the door.The sound got closer and closer and stopped right in front of his door. Then the door carefully opened and someone came in.Even though the woman who arrived was just wearing a light dress, she had a gorgeous rose-like appearance.\u00a0It was Woo Seolha.Seolha, who came in with the door open, was looking straight at him. She had a surprised expression on her face. But it was only for a short time, she soon came to Pyo-wol with a bashful smile.\u201cSo you\u2019re still awake.\u201d\u201cHow did you know I was here?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no place in Chengdu that our White Flower Room\u2019s eyes don\u2019t reach. It\u2019s not particularly hard to find a remarkably handsome man like you.\u201dSeolha naturally approached Pyo-wol as if it was her own room and sat down next to him. When Seonha sat down next to him, the fragrant body scent of Pyo-wol stimulated her.\u201cHow did you do it?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI mean, the young master of the Thunder Gates. What kind of trick did you use to make them think that Nam Ho-san was killed by the Qingcheng sect?\u201d\u201cIt looks like the Qingcheng sect killed him.\u201d\u201cSo you didn\u2019t kill him?\u201dSeolha had a confused expression on her face. It was her who asked Pyo-wol to kill Nam Ho-san, but she was not sure if Pyo-wol really killed him.\u201cBe honest with me. What happened?\u201d\u201cDoes it matter who killed him? All that matters now is that he\u2019s dead.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it, but\u2026\u201d\u201cWhoever is responsible for killing him, you\u2019ve accomplished your purpose anyway. Isn\u2019t that what you want?\u201dIn an instant, Seolha\u2019s eyes became hazy.It was because Pyo-wol had a strong body scent that made her light headed.\u201cYou\u2019re right. Nothing else matters.\u201dSeonha\u2019s breathing became ragged involuntarily.At this moment, her mind is empty, and she can\u2019t think of anything else. All she had in her mind was the thought of wanting to be embraced by Pyo-wol.And she did what she thought.\u201cHaaa\u2026\u201dSeolha hugged Pyo-wol\u2019s waist and looked up.Enjoy reading!To remind people of the names:\u00a0Terms:Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was still a lot of heat on her face. She traced Pyo-wol\u2019s chest with her white fingers.\u201cYou\u2019re like a bad guy.\u201dSeonha said while looking at Pyo-wol.Her appearance was alluring enough to make any man fall in love with her. However, Pyo-wol only looked at her without any change in expression.\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to see you for a while. I can\u2019t leave the sect because a valuable guest has come.\u201d\u201cA dear guest?\u201d\u201cI told you before. The great disciple of the Emei sect, Jeonghwa, is my aunt, and she came to the White Flower Room with her junior sister. She has a very picky personality, so I have to take care of her myself.\u201cWhat is she here for?\u201d\u201cI heard it was to hire a group of mercenaries called the Black Cloud Mercenary Group.\u201d\u201cThe Black Cloud Mercenary Group?\u201d\u201cYes. It seems that it is a place that is evaluated as having the highest level of power among the mercenary groups. They said that they had no choice but to sign a contract because the Emei sect\u2019s power is inferior to the Qingcheng sect.\u201dSeolha answered every question that Pyo-wol asked, unaware that she was already leaking confidential information. She was just talking about whatever came to her mind.Thanks to this, Pyo-wol was able to lay still and get a lot of information.\u201cWhen will Jeonghwa return to their main sect?\u201d\u201cI think she\u2019ll be staying in the White Flower Room for a while.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nice to keep seeing Auntie, but it\u2019s annoying to keep seeing that bitch.\u201d\u201cThat bitch?\u201d\u201cI mean my aunt\u2019s youngest junior disciple Yong Seol-ran.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI just hate everything about her from head to toe. She always likes to be alone with her eyes looking like she seems to know everything. Anyway, I hate her. I want her to disappear from this world.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u00a0\u201cIf I ask you later, can you get rid of that bitch? If she disappears, Auntie will take care of me more.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re a samurai in the Jeonghwa Situation, wouldn\u2019t you also become a magistrate?\u201d\u201cWho said that a bitch like that is the chief? A bitch with no such foundation?\u201dSeolha\u2019s expression turned into a ferocious one. Pyo-wol noticed that she was jealous of the Yong Seol-ran.\u2018Yong Seol-ran\u2026\u2019Pyo-wol recalled memories from seven years ago.Even though he has only seen her once, the memories of that time are so strong that he can remember everything clearly.\u00a0Yong Seol-ran, who was calm and collected, felt more threatening than Jeonghwa, who had a fiery personality.It was still the same today.He doesn\u2019t care much about Jeonghwa, but strangely, he was more concerned about Yong Seol-ran.\u00a0\u2018If we meet in person, will I know why?\u2019As long as they stay in Chengdu anyway, they will end up meeting someday.It\u2019s just a matter of timing.At that moment, Seonha whispered in Pyo-wol\u2019s ear.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that bitch. Don\u2019t even think about her. You just have to move for me.\u201dHer breathing grew hotter.* * *Seolha went back to the White Flower Room before dawn.During that time, he had two more rounds with her. Pyo-wol left the room a long time after Seolha left.The sun was already in the middle of the sky, and quite a few customers were seated in the restaurant on the first floor.Pyo-wol also ordered a light meal and sat down.\u201cWow!\u201d\u201cThat a man\u2019s face\u2026\u201dThe guests who had been eating for a long time looked at Pyo-wol, lost in their hearts. However, Pyo-wol did not even look at them and only looked outside.He was now accustomed to the people\u2019s gazes and gossip so getting their attention wasn\u2019t a big deal. Even Pyo-wol was aware.\u00a0That his appearance is vastly different from others.He had a unique decadent atmosphere that attracted people.It wasn\u2019t like this before.He was handsome, but not enough to attract people like this.It was evident that this had happened after spending seven years with numerous snakes in the snake pit.The clean skin without any blemishes resembles that of a snake, and the red-lighted eyes looked unique. At times, his appearance was burdensome, but now he has decided to accept the reality.After a while, the waiter brought food. There were only a few side dishes including rice and fruits. The waiter placed the food down on the table and glanced at Pyo-wol\u2019s face.\u2018He\u2019s really handsome. I want to live just one day with that kind of face. Then the women will all line up before him.\u2019Even in the eyes of a young waiter, he was enamored because of Pyo-wol\u2019s appearance. At that moment, Pyo-wol called for the waiter.\u201cHey.\u201d\u201cYes? Oh! I\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re so handsome\u2014\u201dThe waiter replied in amazement.He thought Pyo-wol was angry, but Pyo-wol had no intention of blaming him. The reason Pyo-wol called the waiter was for another reason.\u201cDo you know how to get to Dangata?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s a Dangata, are you talking about the old hometown of the Tang Family?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cExcuse me, but why do you want to go to Dangata?\u201dThe waiter asked why with a subtle fear in his eyes. It is also because it was taboo to mention the name of the Tang Family in Chengdu.The Tang Family once ruled over Sichuan, beyond Chengdu, but now it has been completely destroyed, leaving only a few traces of it.This is because the rest of the sects in Sichuan have completely erased the existence of the Tang Family.\u00a0\u201cSince I\u2019m here in Chengdu, I\u2019m just going to take a look.\u201d\u201cAh! It\u2019s just watching.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen I will tell you. Leave our guesthouse and go west. After walking for almost half a day, you will come to a village with three large trees standing at the entrance. If you go twenty six more miles south of that village, you\u2019ll find Dangata. But there will be nothing left there since they had already collapsed a long time ago.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cHey, customer! This is just rambling from an old man, but don\u2019t use the word Tang Family recklessly. It doesn\u2019t matter to people like us, but the warriors of Sichuan are very sensitive.\u201d\u201cWhy is that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just because they\u2019re afraid. The delusion that the Tang Family might be resurrected and rule Sichuan Province still lingers among the martial artists of Sichuan. That\u2019s why they treat those who use the Tang surname more harshly.\u201d\u2018What the waiter said was true.Now, the Qingcheng sect and the Emeis ect were fighting for supremacy, but in the past, the Tang Family was unparalleled.The Tang Family, which was synonymous with poison, fell and left almost no traces, but its name still lingered in people\u2019s minds together with a feeling of fear.\u201cAnyway, since I told you, I\u2019ll now go.\u201dThe waiter nodded at Pyo-wol and ran towards the kitchen. Pyo-wol, who was left alone, ate and went out immediately.The sun was hot.Sichuan Province, a basin topography, was famous for its hot temperatures. Thanks to that, there has been a bountiful harvest of rice for the farmers, but people suffered from one heat.People walking on the street all walked close to the wall to avoid the midday sun. However, Pyo-wol did not care and moved forward while receiving the sunlight.Even the hot heat that makes people suffer has no effect on him.Pyo-wol moved towards the direction the waiter told him.After walking for almost half a day, he came to a village with three large trees standing in the shape of a nest. After turning south from the village and walking about 20 li, he finally came to Dangata.As the waiter said, Dangata was thoroughly demolished. Only a few stones were left in the ruins of Dangata. Even the tiles and bricks were taken by the people who lived nearby.In the ruined space, only the bushes were overgrown. It was a sight that felt the passing of time. Pyo-wol looked at Dangata indifferently.\u201cUnderlying fear.\u201dThe reason Pyo-wol dared to come here was because of the Sichuan people\u2019s perception of the Tang Family.More than a hundred years have passed since their fall, but fear remains in the minds of people. It was possible because the name of Tang itself remained a source of fear.This was exactly what Pyo-wol, who was completely alone, needed.Ssssreuk!At that time, a foreign movement was felt at Pyo-wol\u2019s feet.He looked down and saw a small snake crawling at his feet. It was small in size, but seeing the triangular shape of its head, it was clear that it was a venemous snake.The viper wriggled past Pyo-wol.A normal person would have been terrified and made a fuss, but Pyo-wol did not change his expression. Pyo-wol had lived in a pit full of snakes. A snake with this kind of venom did not pose any threat to him.Pyo-wol expanded his senses.Then he felt the movement of snakes all over the bushes.He didn\u2019t know if it\u2019s because the Tang Familymainly dealt with poison, but there were a lot of poisonous snakes there.Ssss!Pyo-wol clenched his lips and made a bizarre sound, like a snake licking his tongue. Then the snakes hiding in the bush raised their heads all at once and looked at the Pyo-wol.The sight of thousands of snakes staring at Pyo-wol was terrifying to see. However, there was no trace of fear on the face of Pyo-wol, who was stared at by numerous snakes.Snakes would be feared by ordinary people, but to Pyo-wol, they were the most familiar.Ssssss!When Pyo-wol made another bizarre noise, the snakes bowed their heads and led the way.\u201cGood.\u201d* * *Cheongyeop looked at the Thunderr Gates with calm eyes.After descending from Mount Qingcheng, he immediately led his disciples to the Thunder Gates.\u00a0Since Mu Jeong-in seriously hurt Tae Yeon-ho, the master of the Thunder Gates, they had to find out the truth behind the Thunder Gates as soon as possible.As his recovery time increases, the confrontation with the Thunder Gates will intensify. It was not difficult to subdue the Thunder Gates with the current power of the Qingcheng sect.The problem was Soroeumsa, which could be said to be behind them.Tae Yeon-ho was arguing that the Thunder Gates is a completely separate school from the Soroeumsa, but there were no people in Sichuan who believed in that fact.Today, it was the prevailing opinion of Sichuan that there was the support of Soroeumsa in the background of the growth of the Thunder Gates.That is why Muryeongjin also sent his most trusted disciple, Cheongyeop, to rectify the situation. Cheongyeop, with the cooperation of the Thunder Gates\u2019 Mundo, inspected the place where Nam Ho-san died.\u201cYou mean you were attacked by an assassin here?\u201dAs if to tell the situation at the time, the situation in the room was miserable. Blood was splattered everywhere, and all the furniture were broken.Cheongsan, a great disciple who had followed Cheongyeop, stroked the sword traces left on the wall with his finger and said,\u201cThis is definitely a trace left behind by the Seventy-Two Sword Waves of our sect.\u201dSimilar to Cheongyeop, Cheongsan had a calm personality and sharp eyes. There was no doubt in his voice when the words Seventy-Two Sword Waves came out of his mouth.\u201cAmong the external disciples, who has mastered the Seventy-Two Sword Waves?\u201d\u201cAs far as I know, there\u2019s none. Even in the main sect, only a small number of students have learned the technique, so it is more impossible for an external student to learn it.\u201d\u201cYou used to have a copy leaked once, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cThe copy only contained the swordsmanship. Without the support of the cultivation method of our main sect, they cannot bring out half of its original power.\u201dCheongsan shook his head.The martial artists of a prestigious sect seem to be playing separately, but eventually, when they reach the top, they are connected as one living thing.In order to demonstrate the proper power, it is necessary to learn the related techniques and martial arts at the same time. But with only a copy, only the form and the formula exist. So a person can\u2019t ever be successful with such an incomplete book.\u201cMore than anything else, the assassin who learned martial arts using the copy was eventually killed by Senior Brother Mu Jeong.\u201d\u201cIs there any guarantee that he is the only one who has mastered the Seventy-Two Sword Wave from a copy?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure, but I think that it is impossible to learn and bring out its full power with just a copy. At least with their own strength.\u201d\u201cWhat if the proper clan intervened?\u201d\u201cThen it\u2019s a different story. Conversely, it would be possible to analyze the sword art and come up with an appropriate cultivation method. In that case, it would be better to create a new martial arts method. There\u2019s no guarantee that a right cultivation will be appropriate and above all, you never know how long it will take.\u201d\u201cSo we\u2019re back from the beginning.\u201d\u201cI think it would be faster to trace back the path of the assassin by figuring out how the assassin got here than to figure out how the assassin learned how to use the Seventy-Two Sword Waves.\u201dAt Cheongsan\u2019s words, Cheongyeop nodded.He was also aware that there was only one way to solve the situation as quickly as possible. Everything was blurry, as if obscured by fog, but there was one thing that was still clearly visible.It was the presence of an assassin.\u2018Eerie!\u2019It felt as if all the hairs on their body had stood up against the opponent who they had not yet been able to identify his face or his identity. It was the first time they felt this way since the assassination of Woo Gunsang seven years ago.\u2018Is it possible for it to be the same assassin?\u2019Cheongsan immediately denied his thoughts.Seven years ago, that assassin was already killed by Mu Jeong-jin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Just finding the assassin\u2019s infiltration route has already consumed a lot of mental energy. Finding its traces was as laborious as finding a needle on a sandy beach.Dozens of times he searched for a place where he could infiltrate, but he couldn\u2019t find any traces. In the end, they had to change direction and reason by analyzing the most efficient penetration route from the assassin\u2019s point of view rather than looking for traces.In doing so, they found the mansion to the west of Thunder Gates.Cheongyeop questioned whether the assassins had actually used the mansion where there were many people, but he had no choice but to follow Cheongsan\u2019s inference..\u201cHe\u2019s a clever guy. He purposely picked a place where people can see the most. It\u2019s the same reason that if you want to hide a tree, it\u2019s best to hide it in the forest.\u201dCheongsan seemed to have a strong sense of pride for the assassin whom he did not know. He was completely focused as he searched for the assassin\u2019s whereabouts.The disciples who had come with him, at his command, dispersed and explored the people of the mansion. Even now, the people of the mansion held their breath and watched the masters of the Qingcheng sect.They had thus become accustomed to being on the lookout for strangers other than themselves.Cheongsan was sure that if he asked them, he would find out the stranger who had visited that day.He also lived in such a place before entering the Qingcheng sect, so he knew the habits of the people well. He was confident that he would be able to find the whereabouts of the assassin before this evening.\u00a0But to his surprise, until the sun went down, he did not once meet any person from the mansion who testified that they saw a stranger that day.\u201cNo, does this make sense? That many people didn\u2019t see a stranger that day.\u201dCheongsan muttered with a puzzled expression on his face. Cheongyeop comforted him.\u201cMaybe the assassin broke in through another route, so don\u2019t be heartbroken.\u201d\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense. This is obviously the best route.\u201d\u201cHu! It\u2019s getting late today, so let\u2019s try again tomorrow.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cThink of the other disciples as well.\u201dAt that moment, Cheongsan looked at his disciples.The second and third generation disciples were looking at Cheongsan with a straight face. They were very tired from exploring Cheongsan\u2019s command all day.It was unreasonable to push them further.\u201cI apologize, everyone. Amitabha! Then we\u2019re going to rest today at a guesthouse and look for the assassin again tomorrow.\u201d\u201cYou thought well.\u201d\u201cBut, is there a guest house for this person to stay?\u201d\u201cWhy do we go to a guest house? When you go to Chengdu, there is the Golden Gates.\u201d\u201cOh!\u201dCheongsan let out a sigh.Golden Gate is a sect closely related to the Qingcheng sect. They were located north of the Chengdu, ready to provide accommodation for the Qingcheng sect a at any time.\u201cWe must hurry to enter the Golden Gate.\u201d\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe two left Jintang County with the disciples of the Qingcheng sectIn order to get to the Golden Gates, one had to pass through the downtown area of \u200b\u200bChengdu.As the dozens of disciples moved, people looked at them with curious eyes. It was because they recognized that they were the masters of the Qingcheng sect.It was not easy to see the disciples of the Qingcheng sect on the streets, no matter how strong they were. It was even rarer for such a large number of disciples to travel in a group.People looked at the disciples of the Qingcheng sect as if they were a rare spectacle.Cheongyeop was concerned about the gaze of those people, but he worked hard to pretend he was calm and moved on. But when he arrived at the center of Chengdu, his footsteps had no choice but to stop.It was because of a group of people walking from the opposite side.Unlike the disciples of the Qingcheng sect, the other group was dominated by women.Cheongyeop\u2019s expression turned cold. Because he knew the identity of the opponent.\u201cEmei sect!\u201dThey were the disciples of the Emei sect and Baekhwabang, whose main focus was on Jeonghwa. The Emei sect also recognized the disciples of the Qingcheng sect.\u201cThe disciples of the Qingcheng sect are coming down here.\u201dJeonghwa\u2019s expression, who was at the forefront, changed terribly. With a look as if she was about to devour them, she glared at the Qingcheng sect\u2019s disciples including Cheongyeop.It was the same for the disciples of the Qingcheng sect.Chaeeng!When the disciples of the Qingcheng sect unsheath their swords in unison, the martial artists of the Emei sect took out their weapons as well.A sudden tension flowed between the two forces. But they did not clash. It was because they believed that a sudden clash without any preparation would only lead to destruction.Cheongyeop raised his hand to make the disciples restrain themselves, and then stepped forward.Of course, on the side of the Emei sect, Jeonghwa came out.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Jeonghwa.\u201d\u201cHeh! What did you come down here for? To eat? If you got a nickname called White Sword Crane, you should live in the mountains like a crane.\u201d\u201cAre you not coming down because of something urgent, Jeonghwa? It would be overwhelming just to protect the main sect, but you have the time to worry about other things, no, do you not understand the situation properly?\u201d\u201cCheongyeop! Shut that mouth.\u201d\u201cHeh! The fart guy got angry. That\u2019s exactly the case. Who created this situation in the first place dares to shout it out?\u201d\u00a0Explosive momentum flowed from Jeonghwa and Cheongyeop.Although they started fighting seven years ago, the two were friends before that. It was clear that the both of them would lead the Emei sect and the Qingcheng sect, so they greeted each other right away.The situation suddenly changed after the assassination of Woo Gunsang seven years ago. When it was revealed that the person who commissioned the assassination was the Emei sect, the Qingcheng sect erupted.Due to his uncontrollable anger, Mu Jeong-jin attacked the disciples of the Emei sect who had entered the underground cave with him.\u00a0Jeonghwa was also there.Jeonghwa had to face the humiliation of escaping with only a few disciples.The Emei sect pleaded innocent, saying that it was nothing more than a delusional accusation. The public opinion of Sichuan Province was divided because the Qingcheng sect could not provide any clear evidence other than Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s words.The Qingcheng sect was greatly outraged by the Emei sect\u2019s behavior who was denying it to the end.In the end, the two sects clashed violently, inflicting numerous casualties.After that, they collided frequently, and the emotional rift deepened as time went on.Jeonghwa looked at Cheongyeop with eyes full of malice. She wanted to kill all of the Cheongyeop and Qingcheng sect disciples right away, but given the opponent\u2019s power, it would not be easy to do so.Even the martial artists of the White Flower Room joined, so the weight was still inclined towards the Qingcheng sect. The results of the last few big clashes show that the Qingcheng sect was stronger.Yong Seol-ran who was beside Jeonghwa whispered.\u201cNow is the time to step down. If we clash with them for no reason, our damage will be greater.\u201d\u201cQuiet. Are you talking about escaping in front of the Qingcheng sect? Aren\u2019t you ashamed?\u201dJeonghwa criticized Yong Seol-ran.Yong Seol-ran sighed and backed away when her words didn\u2019t reach Jeonghwa. Jeonghwa looked at Cheongyeop again and said,\u201cDid you ordered the assassination after knowing that the young master of the Thunder Gates and the sect leader of the White Flower Room were having an affair? That\u2019s amazing. Qingcheng sect! You threw all the people in the trash.\u201d\u201cWhere are you going to dig your ears? You\u2019ve invested seven years to kill the most promising member of our sect. Where did you learn such devotion? Oh! Of course, you learned from your master, the Abbess of Nine Calamities.\u201d\u201cQuiet.\u201dJeonghwa, who could not even find the main temple, was furious and looked at it. The eyes of some martial artists were so intense that anyone would tremble just by just looking at their eyes. However, Cheongyeop did not blink an eye even when he looked into her eyes.Although he was often underestimated compared to his friends because of his gentle personality, he was still a great disciple of the Qingcheng sect.His achievements were not far behind compared to Jeonghwa.Knowing that fact, Jeonghwa only taunted, but did not attack. There was an atmosphere that they were about to stab each other at any moment, but neither the Cheongyeop nor the Jeonghwa made such a move.This was Chengdu.It was the center of Sichuan Province and the place where the largest number of people lived. All the wealth of Sichuan went to this place. It was clear that if a riot were to happen here, they would lose a huge amount of money along with the people of Chengdu.If they really had to fight, they had to do it somewhere other than Chengdu. At least far from the center of Chengdu.\u2018After all, this is what it is.\u2019Yong Seol-ran, who was standing behind Jeonghwa, sighed softly. If possible, she wanted to return to Mt. Emei immediately but that was impossible. There should not have been such a collision between the Qingcheng sect and Emei sect in the first place.\u2018Where did we go wrong?\u2019The root of the problem was clear.It was the Emei sect.No matter how many words and excuses she made, that fact did not change.Yong Seol-ran did not deny that fact.She was the only one who felt regretful about what happened since she could have stopped the situation before it deteriorated out of control.\u2018Seven years ago, that assassin was the problem. He crossed the inescapable net from which everyone can\u2019t come back while killing Woo Gunsang.\u2019After that incident, all escape routes were blocked.\u00a0At the edge of a cliff with nowhere to retreat, the two sects were facing each other.\u2018If it wasn\u2019t for that, the situation wouldn\u2019t have gotten this far.\u2019The more he thought about it, the more amazing the assassin\u2019s feats became.Because of one assassin, the Qingcheng sect and the Emeis ect had to make such a life-and-death decision.Even the assassin died seven years ago.Just as San Sima Yi was being harassed by the dead Zhuge Liang, the Emei sect and Qingcheng sect were still being influenced by what the assassin did.\u00a0\u2018But in the end, we don\u2019t even know his name.\u2019Yong Seol-ran sighed and looked around.In the confrontation between the two factions, all the people nearby came out to watch.\u00a0Most of the eyes contained fear and curiosity at the same time. However, there was a pair of eyes that felt like her chest was pierced like a dagger.Yong Seol-ran looked in the direction where she felt the gaze. But she didn\u2019t see any strange eyes.\u00a0\u201cAm I mistaken?\u201d* * *\u201dGood instincts.\u201dPyo-wol, who disappeared from the crowd, softened his eyes.It was the first time he saw Yong Seol-rang in seven years. It was a face he couldn\u2019t forget, even if he tried to forget it. Because it was engraved so deeply.Yong Seol-ran and Jeonghwa.Both of them were people who had entered the underground cave after chasing Pyo-wol. Of course, the impression was bound to remain strong.He heard from Seolha that the two had entered the city, but seeing them with his own eyes like this was different.The same was true of the martial artists of the Qingcheng sect.Although Cheongyeop and Cheongsan were not the warriors who participated at the time, the reason that they were disciples of the Qingcheng sect alone was enough to attract Pyo-wol\u2019s interest.Pyo-wol left the seat quietly after imprinting the faces of the Qingcheng sect and Emei sect as they confronted each other in his mind one by one.They were fighting sharply as if they were going to fight right away, but he knew that it was only for show. To make them really fight, they needed a proper spark.\u2018Still, it\u2019s not a bad start.\u2019Both sides still have quite a few giants.All of the great disciples of the Qingcheng sect and the Emei sect were among the most prominent in Jianghu.If he can keep the fire bigger, he will be able to lure out all the humans who are still hiding in the mountains.Pyo-wol came back to the guesthouse, organizing his thoughts. However, an unexpected person was waiting for him in the guest cup.\u2018Heo Ran-ju!\u2019It was Heo Ran-ju who wore clothes that showed off her breasts and voluptuous body. However, it was not only Heo Ran-ju who was waiting for him.There was a man with a strong impression, who seemed to be in his mid to late forties, with Go Dosa.When Pyo-wol came into the guest house, Heo Ran-ju stood up and greeted him.\u201cWhere are you coming from like that? We had waited a long time.\u201dHeo Ran-ju smiled bashfully. It was a bright smile, as if she had been captivated by Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol looked at her without saying a word, then shifted his gaze to a man in his mid to late forties.He gave off a similar atmosphere with Heo Ran-ju. He felt the wildness that only those who lived roughly and freely could exude.Even the Go Dosa, who usually likes to joke around, looked like he was restraining himself by his side. That meant that a middle-aged man was superior to Go Dosa.Pyo-wol immediately recognized his identity.\u2018This is the leader of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group.\u2019When Pyo-wol\u2019s gaze reached him, a middle-aged man stood up.\u201cAs Go Dosa said, he\u2019s a good man. I\u2019m Zhang Mu-ryang, the leader of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group. It\u2019s nice to meet you!\u201d\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here to see you.\u201d\u201cI have no business with you.\u201d\u201cThey said you punched Ranju, whom I cherish like my younger sister? I think this is enough for me to visit.\u201dZhang Mu-ryang gave strength to both eyes.It was usually Zhang Mu-ryang who was casual and friendly , but when he gives strength to his eyes like this, the atmosphere changes like other people.A good person can never lead a group of mercenaries like the Black Cloud Mercenary Group. It required strong leadership and cruel hands to unite these ruthless people. Zhang Mu-ryang was a leader who possessed both qualities perfectly.Pyo-wol also recognized that fact. But he wasn\u2019t scared nor discouraged. Pyo-wol narrowed his eyes and said.\u201cSo you want to get revenge on your sister?\u201d\u201cWhat revenge? I just came here to see your face because my sister who I love was beaten.\u201dZhang Mu-ryang\u2019s face was red as he was forced to hold back his laughter. Heo Ran-ju clicked her tongue.\u201cAck! Who got hit? It\u2019s just rubbing.\u201d\u201cCheat the person you want to deceive. You had a deep internal injury, don\u2019t you remember that the doctor stayed up all night to treat you? They said four weeks of work was exhausted from cleaning out cheap passives.\u201d\u201cDamn! Do you really have to say that out loud?\u201dHeo Ran-ju protested, but Zhang Mu-ryang ignored her and looked at Pyo-wol.\u201cSo, let\u2019s say we have dinner together. Isn\u2019t that what we can do? We are not enemies of any kind\u2026\u201dHe was looking at Pyo-wol with a smile on his face. But his eyes were not smiling at all.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It is an isolated space where other people\u2019s gaze is blocked, so it is suitable for sharing confidential information.Zhang Mu-ryang ordered the most expensive food from the owner of the restaurant.Pyo-wol sat down without a word and looked at Zhang Mu-ryang.Zhang Mu-ryang looked at Pyo-wol with his body buried deep in the chair, while Go Dosa and Heo Ran-ju were smiling.The most surprising thing was Heo Ran-ju. She was looking at Pyo-wol with deep eyes, as if she had no memory of being beaten by him.\u00a0She was rather curious about Pyo-wol\u2019s reaction. Usually people get flustered when they are in this kind of situation. Most of the men she saw were like that.\u00a0She expected that this time will be the same too. However, contrary to her expectations, Pyo-wol did not have a single change in his expression.\u201cTsk! You\u2019re no fun\u201dIn the end, Heo Ran-ju pouted her lips with a sullen expression. Then Zhang Mu-ryang opened his mouth.\u201cAs you can see, I\u2019m having trouble because you\u2019re being a nuisance.\u201d\u201cWhy am I annoying?\u201d\u201cYou went outside and got yourself hit, so it\u2019s a problem. Is there anything you can do well?\u201d\u201cDamn it!\u201dHeo Ran-ju, who couldn\u2019t say anything, rubbed her lips. Although she found nothing scary in the world, Heo Ran-ju had a bit of a hard time dealing with Zhang Mu-ryang, the captain of their group.This is because Zhang Mu-ryang is not only superior in strength, but also leads the Black Cloud Mercenary Group by setting clear goals with his outstanding leadership.His strength and strong leadership united the mercenaries of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group.\u00a0Although it is said that Heo Ran-ju possessed a brilliant way of thinking, she was also a member of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group. All of her actions were carried out only within the limits of what Zhang Mu-ryang tolerated.\u201cRan-ju, from my point of view, has mastered some great martial arts so it\u2019s really amazing for you to be able to subdue her immediately. If you don\u2019t mind me asking, can you tell who your master is? He\u2019s the one who raised such a great disciple, so he must be also great.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAh! Don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m saying this because I\u2019m just genuinely curious. I also want to offer a friendly relationship.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re very reticent. Were you always that way? Or is it because you\u2019re uncomfortable at this moment?\u201d\u201cYou already know. The reason why I\u2019m like this.\u201dThis time, Zhang Mu-ryang closed his lips.\u2018He\u2019s not going to be easy to deal with.\u2019He was a martial artist who overpowered Heo Ran-ju instantly.Although she had an outgoing personality and an unruly temper, she was still strong. Otherwise, it would not have been possible for her to become the Vice Captain of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group.Although it is said that she was careless because she did not anticipate Pyo-wol\u2019s instantaneous movement, that is not an excuse.It was true that she had lost, so it was certain that Pyo-wol was that much of a threat. So, he tried to confirm Pyo-wol\u2019s capability. This is because if it was a warrior with enough skill to subdue Heo Ran-ju at once, then that would mean he would have learned martial arts from a proper master or a master with a high reputation.However, Pyo-wol was consistently silent. He had an expression of someone resolute of not telling them anything about himself.\u201cThis young friend is very suspicious.\u201d\u201cI was taught to doubt everything except for myself.\u201d\u201cIs that so? Then you learned it right.\u201dZhang Mu-ryang laughed out loud.Food came out in the midst of such meaningless conversations.As the top-class dishes from the guesthouse came out one after another, Go DOsa trembled with his chopsticks.\u201cLet\u2019s chat while eating food. When you\u2019re hungry, good words don\u2019t come out.\u201d\u201cYeah! I\u2019ve been starving all day and I\u2019m hungry.\u201dHeo Ran-ju also hurriedly picked up her chopsticks.As the two of them livened up the atmosphere, Zhang Mu-ryang also smiled and raised his chopsticks.But until the end, Pyo-wol did not raise his chopsticks.\u201cWhy? Do you think the food is poisoned?\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019m just not hungry.\u201d\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you tell me right away? If I had, I would have ordered a little less food.\u201d\u201cBut you\u2019re going to eat it all, right?\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201dZhang Mu-ryang smiled and looked at Heo Ran-ju and Go Dosa.The two were playing with their chopsticks like crazy. Where their chopsticks passed, the food disappeared. The two of them ate and ate the food as if they were obsessed with face. Thanks to this, more than half of the food has already disappeared into their stomachs.It seemed that there was no need to worry about the food having leftovers.Zhang Mu-ryang knew that it would be of no use to drag the horse beyond this. Although he hadn\u2019t said a few words to Pyo-wol, his personality was already pictured in his mind.\u2018He has a lot of doubts, and he doesn\u2019t trust people easily. He also draws a clear line and refuses to let anyone in.\u2019For such a person, it might have been more effective to bring out the main point in a straight-forward way than to speak in a roundabout manner.\u201cI\u2019ve researched your past. Nothing came out. Oh! Don\u2019t be offended. Isn\u2019t it natural that you want to know about someone you\u2019re interested in? The reason I say this is because I\u2019m interested in you.\u201d\u201cInterested?\u201d\u201cYeah! I would be lying if I said I\u2019m not interested on someone who overpowered Ranju in a short span of time. I want to recruit you into the Black Cloud Mercenary Group. From your point of view, it may just be a group of rogues, but I have a dream. My goal is to make it a proper sect. To do that, I need at least one more talented person. I won\u2019t ask you what your past is or why you came to Chengdu. I can also promise you the best treatment, so join the Black Cloud Mercenary Group.\u201dZhang Mu-ryang looked directly into Pyo-wol\u2019s eyes.Pyo-wol thought his eyes resembled those of a bear.At first glance, he looked more honest than any other animal, but in fact, it was the bear that was cunning which no other animal can rival. With the overwhelming power that came from its huge body, the cunning brain, and the brutality of eating its prey alive with its breath attached, the bear was a top-notch beast.If you are deceived by that person\u2019s nice smile, you will surely be eaten.\u201cI\u2019ll give you anything. If you want, I\u2019ll give you Ranju as well.\u201d\u201cOraboni!\u201dHeo Ran-ju shouted, but Zhang Mu-ryang did not care and continued,\u201cNo matter what her personality is, her looks make up for it. I don\u2019t know how the nights with her are like, but all the guys she\u2019s slept with seem to be satisfied.\u201d\u201cOh! Really\u2026\u201dHeo Ran-ju groaned as if angry. But Pyo-wol knew she wasn\u2019t mad.No matter how angry her expression was,\u00a0 there was something she could never hide. It was the movement of the fine muscles around the eyes. Pyo-wol was able to grasp the emotions of the other person through such fine muscle movements.Heo Ran-ju was not angry. Rather, she was expecting a positive response from Pyo-wol. Heo Ran-ju\u2019s slightly shriveled breath was telling Pyo-wol how she felt.\u2018That bitch really likes that guy.\u2019Go Dosa looked at Heo Ran-ju and smiled slightly.Heo Ran-ju was never a virtuous woman. In fact, it would be strange if a woman who had been a rogue for many years was quiet.Heo Ran-ju was not called the \u201cBlack Ranju\u201d for nothing.She was a woman who had to possess a man she liked. The red blush that appeared on her face as she looked at Pyo-wol was proof that she longed for him.\u2018Even if you look at the same guy, that guy\u2019s face is amazing. If it\u2019s Ranju\u2019s personality, I\u2019ll leave it in the room and get bitten and kicked.\u2019Zhang Mu-ryang looked at Pyo-wol with a grin.It was as if he was looking forward to Pyo-wol\u2019s decision. It was his idea that a man could not refuse a beautiful woman like Heo Ran-ju.However, Pyo-wol\u2019s reply betrayed his expectations.\u201cIt\u2019s not that compelling.\u201d\u201cWhich one do you not like? Joining the group or giving away Ranju?\u201d\u201cAll of it.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re more greedy than you look. You\u2019re still not satisfied.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not very fond of food that I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get sick of eating\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm!\u201dZhang Mu-ryang\u2019s eyes grew sharper. Heo Ran-ju\u2019s face, sitting next to him, was red with anger.\u2018How dare you reject me?\u2019I\u2019ve met many men so far, but Pyo-wol was the first to reject her. Her face was full of shameful light. Heo Ran-ju bit her lip until it bled.Tension lingered over Pyo-wol\u2019s refusal.Go Dosa wiggled his fingers and looked at Pyo-wol and Zhang Mu-ryang. If Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s command is given, he is ready to bounce at any time.That was then.\u201cPuhahaha!\u201dSuddenly, Zhang Mu-ryang burst into laughter.After a moment\u2019s hesitation, he opened his mouth.\u201cI\u2019m joking, joking! Why are you making such a serious expression like a fool? No matter how much I like to have you, do you think I\u2019ll give you Ranju? What a big person you are.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201c I just wanted to make fun of you because of your serious expression. Well, it doesn\u2019t seem to work. Heh! But I want to say something like this. If possible, I hope we don\u2019t run into each other. I love to talk, but the other guys don\u2019t. Actions take precedence over brains. These words are all for you, so I hope you will listen to them.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll say something too\u201d\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d\u201cIf one day you go down the street with your head falling off your body and you see your world ending, it\u2019s okay to think it\u2019s because of me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201dAt Pyo-wol\u2019s unexpected words, Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s expression hardened.\u201cI\u2019m joking. What makes you look so serious? Like a fool.\u201dPyo-wol smiled. But Zhang Mu-ryang couldn\u2019t laugh any more.* * *Zhang Mu-ryang and his party left the guest house.When he came out, the smile disappeared from Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s face.He looked at the guest house with a dry face. To be precise, he was looking at the private room where he and Pyo-wol had been sitting before.Pyo-wol\u2019s face could be seen through the window of the private room.Pyo-wol was also looking at him.\u2018That guy!\u2019Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s face, which had been dry, turned colder.A mercenary\u2019s life is hard.They have nowhere to go, and no one welcomes them.The only places where they are most useful are where disputes or big fights between sects take place.Most of the mercenaries only learned miscellaneous skills, let alone a proper martial art. So, the reality was that they were not treated properly.However, the Black Cloud Mercenary group led by Zhang Mu-ryang was different.There are about 50 warriors who can be called masters, about 100 who can be useful, and the remaining two hundred are horsemen.With this level of power, any clan could be annihilated overnight. Nevertheless, they wander the battlefield because no one in Jianghu welcomes them.Existing sects did not welcome the arrival of mercenary groups such as the Black Cloud Mercenary Group under a territory of their jurisdiction.There was no strong sect that would welcome the arrival of an armed group made up of wild savages. It would have been nice to be able to trample the existing sects by force and take their place, but it was not easy.Most of the existing strong sects were connected by a close relationship.In the Qingcheng sect, numerous branches, military officers, pyo-guk (security/escort company), and aristocrats were affiliated with them for over hundreds of years which have led to a sense of community.\u00a0It was the same with the Emei sect.They usually work individually, but when the group they belong to is threatened, they will unite and fight as one.The power of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group was undoubtedly great. But it was just them.Unlike the Qingcheng sect, they didn\u2019t have their own aristocrats, and there was no other sects to help. Above all, they did not have a proper system and hierarchy.\u00a0Although the hierarchy is maintained with the strong leadership of Zhang Mu-ryang and the power of the Vice Captain Heo Ran-ju and Yang Woo-jeong, they have not reached the depth and vastness of the powerful sects such as the Qingcheng sect and Emei sect.For that reason, they did not dare to rub and intervene in the area occupied by those existing clans. That was also the reason why they had no choice but to remain as a mercenary group despite possessing a powerful force.In the case of Thunder Gates, luck followed.They settled in Jintang County, where the War of Demons and Heaven took place, and at that time, the Qingcheng sect and Emei sect were living in a dark period.Thanks to that, they were able to become the owner of\u00a0 Jintang County in Sichuan without any checks. However, such luck did not follow the Black Cloud Mercenary Group.If a huge war such as the War of Demons and Heaven happened again then they could do the same but there was little chance of that happening.Therefore, he saw the current conflict in Sichuan as a golden opportunity.The exact reason why the Qingcheng sect and the Emei sect are fighting is not known, but if they can stand on the side of the Emei sect and inflict a heavy blow to the Qingcheng sect, they\u2019re sure that they\u2019ll be able to occupy a place near the Western Highlands.If they exercise their acquaintance and influence with foreign personnel who have built up this place long ago, they will soon be able to establish themselves as a prestigious sect.If only the Black Cloud Mercenary Group could settle down, there were many rogues that could be attracted. If they absorb those who wander around the world like vagrants, then they won\u2019t have to be afraid of the Emei sect either.\u00a0That was Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s grand plan.\u00a0However, a stumbling block appeared before his plan even started.It was Pyo-wol, who was just looking at him from the window.When he heard that Heo Ran-ju was the one who lost, he thought that Pyo-wol\u2019s martial arts was only great. If he was such a great master, it was worth bringing him into the Black Cloud Mercenary Group. So he came to recruit him directly.\u00a0However, the person he saw in person was not someone who would be under him.The moment he saw Pyo-wol for the first time, he felt goosebumps coming up his spine.As he led the Black Cloud Mercenary Group, he participated in numerous battles and met so many people. So Zhang Mu-ryang prided himself on having an accurate eye on judging people.\u00a0Pyo-wol was the first person to make him feel such a creepy feeling at first sight.It wasn\u2019t just because of his strong martial arts that suppressed Heo Ran-ju at once.If you simply line up the warriors who will subdue Heo Ran-ju with no feats, there will be more than enough to go around a large lake.\u00a0There were many masters in the river, and there were also many martial artists who reached a level that could not be guessed.Zhang Mu-ryang was not afraid of them. This is because even if their martial arts were strong, they could still understand their inner feelings.But Pyo-wol was different.From the moment he first saw him, he couldn\u2019t read anything. Not only his thoughts, but also the changes in his emotions, habits, and others could not be grasped.It was like facing a deep dark darkness.It was the first time in his life that he felt this way.If he had encountered it elsewhere, he would have just ignored it. No matter who the opponent is, if it has nothing to do with him, he can just ignore it.But this place was Sichuan.It was a place where the Black Cloud Mercenary Group decided to start anew.Any small variable could not be tolerated.\u201cGo Dosa!\u201d\u201cTell me, Danju!\u201d\u201cAdd Maun and a few more boys to him. We must keep a close eye on him from now on.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d\u201cAnd Ranju!\u201dHeo Ran-ju didn\u2019t answer. Her lips were torn and bleeding. It was so shocking that Pyo-wol had rejected her. There was a dark life in her eyes.\u201cI\u2019ll kill him.\u201dAt the creepy voice of Heo Ran-ju, Zhang Mu-ryang smirked.\u201cOf course you should, because he dared to reject my offer. But not now. There is no profit in dealing with him.\u201d\u201cDoes wealth matter? When my self-esteem is broken?\u201d\u201cRanju! You fool. A person needs wealth to take care of their self-esteem. When this is over, I will let you do whatever you want, so be patient. For now, we need to set up our base in Sichuan Province first.\u201d\u201cDo you promise?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dZhang Mu-ryang\u2019s smile widened.Even if it wasn\u2019t because of Heo Ran-ju, he had no intention of keeping Pyo-wol alive.This is because Pyo-wol\u2019s unique atmosphere and eyes were ingrained to his heart.\u2018Surely, he\u2019s going to cause some problems.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 62": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 62Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayGolden Gates was originally a simple sect located in the Geumcheon area.However, when Chengdu became a land without its owner because of the collapse of the Tang Family, their base was boldly moved.Together with the support of the Qingcheng sect, they were able to successfully settle in Chengdu. After that, they were called out terribly, and they became the most reliable companions of the Qingcheng sect.Yeo Sanwi, the sect leader of the Golden Gate, was a martial artist in his mid to late fifties. Even though he was walking downhill after his heyday as a warrior, his eyes were still harsh.He welcomed the masters of the Qingcheng sect who suddenly came, and willingly gave up his dormitory for them.Yeo Sanwi treated the disciples of the Qingcheng sect with the utmost respect.It is inevitable that the Golden Gates would not have grown as it is now if the Qingcheng sect did not take care of it.\u201cIf there is anything lacking, please tell me at any time. I will do everything I can.\u201d\u201cI will always be grateful for the help of sect leader Yeo. When I return to the main mountain, I will definitely tell our sect leader about this.\u201d\u201cHeh heh! There\u2019s no need for that\u2026\u201dYeo Sanwi liked Cheongyeop\u2019s words. Cheongyeop was the most likely talent for the next sect leader. If he strengthened his relationship with him, it would have been beneficial to the Golden Gates, but if not, then there was also nothing to lose.Although the Qingcheng sect and the Emei sect were fighting fiercely, Yeo Sanwi was certain that the Qingcheng sect would win. This is because the power of the Qingcheng sect was superior.After talking with Cheongyeop for half an hour, Yeo Sanwi retreated.Cheongyeop, who had finally found his freedom, sighed softly.Yeo Sanwi is all good, but talking so much was a problem. Because of that, after talking with him, it felt like all of his energy was drained.\u201cAmitabha!\u201dAt that time, Cheongsan suddenly entered his residence. Cheongyeop shook his head and calmed himself down.\u201cAre you here?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cWhat are the movements of the Emei sect?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re staying in the White Flower Room and not moving.\u201d\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\u201cYes! I have some of my disciples waiting near the White Flower Room just in case. If there is any strange movement, I will contact you right away.\u201d\u201cGood job.\u201d\u201cAs a disciple of the Qingcheng sect, of course I should do it.\u201dCheongyeop smiled at Cheongsan\u2019s answer.Although they were from the same sect, the dispositions of the great disciples were all different.If Cheongyeop was careful, his immediate disciple, Qingming, was quick tempered. While Cheongsan had a meticulous personality. Thanks to this, he was able to believe and entrust this kind of work to them,The task that Cheongyeop entrusted to Cheongsan was to monitor the movement of the Emei sect.Fortunately, the clash between the two sides just ended with provocation.If the balance of the two sides had been disrupted and a sword fighting had occurred, half of the disciples of the Qingcheng sect here would have lost their lives.Emei sect\u2019s Jeonghwa also took a step back because an unexpected fight was burdensome.\u201cHuh! I don\u2019t know how the situation got to this point.\u201d\u201cTrue\u2026.\u201dCheongyeop and Cheongsan sighed at the same time.Although the Qingcheng sect was aiming for the hegemony of Sichuan Province, the Emei sect was a burdensome existence.Their intention was to avoid head-on collisions as much as possible.However, this was the policy of the inquisitor, so there was nothing he could do about it.\u201cWe have to find out the beast that killed the young master of the Thunder Gates. Only then can we understand the truth of the situation and respond appropriately.\u201d\u201cOf course. That\u2019s why I want to contact Haomun.\u201d\u201cHaomun?\u201d\u201cYes. They probably know what\u2019s going on at the bottom the best. They must know who had access to the Thunder Gates that day.\u201d\u201cWell, their attention is indeed spread like a spider\u2019s web here in Sichuan.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a bit reluctant to use them, but there\u2019s nothing we can do about it. To save time at a time like this, we have no choice but to use them.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll leave it to you.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t let you down.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dCheongyeop nodded his head. Cheongsan was the priest he trusted the most.Qingming, the strongest force, was far from easy to deal with. If he had brought him in, he would have only been a hindrance.\u2018More sects than I thought were involved, the Golden Gate and White Gate\u2019Hell, he don\u2019t know what kind of trouble it will be if he don\u2019t catch the assassin.\u201d* * *Pyo-wol slept right where the bed faced the wall.His senses have now become more sensitive and it is possible for him to detect in advance if there are any beings hiding their presence or approaching.\u00a0However, he couldn\u2019t break the habit of sleeping with his back against the wall to protect himself for a long time.Even if his martial arts become stronger now, even if the senses become sharper, such a habit will never be erased.Pyo-wol squatted like a shrimp and slept with his back against the wall.His breathing was so quiet and long, no one would be able to notice the change as he inhaled and exhaled not until they concentrated all their nerves.While he was sleeping, Pyo-wol was instinctively practicing the Turtle Breathing Technique. After reaching the highest level of the Turtle Breathing Technique, he can naturally use it even when he sleeps.Because of that, it was almost impossible to detect Pyo-wol\u2019s presence or breathing from the outside.A puzzled expression appeared on Maun\u2019s face.It was two o\u2019clock before he was ordered to watch Pyo-wol from Go Dosa.Shortly after receiving the order, he and three of his colleagues came to the guesthouse where Pyo-wol was staying.Zhang Mu-ryang designated Pyo-wol as a first-class surveillance target.The first-class surveillance target in the Black Cloud Mercenary Group was a generic term for dangerous people among the strong masters.At least four members were attached to the first-class surveillance target and they took turns monitoring them. It was Maun who was in charge of everything.Maun was so capable that it could be said that he specialized in this kind of work.Not only is he excellent at monitoring, tracking, and hiding, but he is born with the ability to understand the opponent\u2019s trends, psychological state, and nemesis.\u00a0So whenever this kind of thing happened, Zhang Mu-ryang entrusted the task to Maun. And Maun never disappointed\u00a0 Zhang Mu-ryang.The place where Maun took place was boldly in the room right next to Pyo-wol. While the rest of his members were waiting in the guest house or on the other side of the road.They were not as good at stealth as Maun, so there was a high chance of getting caught. So intead, they were observing the movements of Pyo-wol through the window of the guest house.\u2018I\u2019ve definitely checked that he was inside\u2014\u2019\u2019Maun\u2019s eyes narrowed.He put his ear close to the wall of the guest room and tried to listen to Pyo-wol\u2019s breathing. But no matter how hard he tried to raise his hearing, I couldn\u2019t hear Pyo-wol\u2019s breathing.\u2018Does this make sense?\u2019Maun carefully opened the window and looked into the other side of the room. His eyes met with those who were watching from the other side.Maun asked if Pyo-wol had ever gone out in sign language they learned in advance. Those on the other side of the guest house replied that there was no movement.\u2018Then I\u2019m sure he\u2019s still inside.\u2019Maun sensed that he had met the most difficult enemy of a lifetime.\u201cShit!\u201dUnknowingly, he let out a sound and covered his mouth with both hands in surprise.He quickly put his ear back to the wall in the room where Pyo-wol was sleeping. But there was no sign of any sign in the room.\u2018What the hell? Is he really really inside or not?\u2019The only way left was to drill a hole in the wall and see it for himself. But that method was more likely to be caught.Eventually, Maun had to spend the night leaning his ear against the wall.It was such a boring time.There was not even a minute left before dawn.The movement of those targets on top-of-the-line monitoring were to be reported.\u2018Well, I wonder if there\u2019s anything to report\u2026\u2019Maun looked at the comrades who were watching from the other side. Then he nodded with a look that his colleagues knew.One of them sneaked out of the guest house.Jong Pyeong was the youngest among those monitoring Pyo-wol.Jongpyeong recurred as much as Maun, but he was still young and did not have much experience. For that reason, he mainly acted as a liaison between the two sides.\u2018They should go to Danju as much as possible.\u2019It was never easy to keep a top-level target under surveillance all day.The four had to take turns monitoring organically.As long as Jong Pyeong is away, the burden on the rest of the people increases. Because of that, Jong Pyeong ran through the streets of Chengdu at dawn with all his might.The inexperienced Jong Pyeong did not know. The fact that someone is secretly following him. Even if he had a lot of experience, it was impossible to notice the existence of the pursuer.It was Pyo-wol who was secretly pursuing him.The moment Jong Pyeong began to move, Pyo-wol also moved.In the room next door, Maun was watching with his nerves on his nerves, but he couldn\u2019t sense his movements. Pyo-wol escaped silently like a snake, assimilated with the darkness and followed Jong Pyeong.Jong Pyeong, unaware of this fact, eagerly ran to the guesthouse where the Black Cloud Mercenary Group were staying.The guest house was too small to accommodate the three hundred and fifty men of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group. Still, the reason why the Black Cloud Mercenary Group is renting the guesthouse\u2019s annex was that not all of the members have joined yet.Of the three hundred fifty members of the Black Cloud Corps, only about fifty had entered Chengdu. The rest of the personnel will arrive near the vicinity of Chengdu within a few days and wait.Jong Pyeong visited Yang Woo-jeong. Yang Woo-jeong was very good looking and was playing the role of Vice Captain of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group.Jong Pyeong knelt down on one knee and reported to Yang Woo-jeong.\u201cThe primary watch has been motionless all night. Soon the sun will come up, so we\u2019re going to change our method from remote surveillance to close surveillance.\u201d\u201cI see. You have it hard.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cDanju seems to be quite concerned about him. So, remain vigilant at all times and keep an eye on him.\u201d\u201cI will tell them that.\u201d\u201cGo.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dJong Pyeong bowed his head to Yang Woo-jeong and stepped back.Yang Woo-jeong looked at Jongpyeong\u2019s back and returned to his residence.A map lay on his desk.It was a map of the Qingcheng sect which Yang Woo-jeong made himself.When he went to negotiate with the Qingcheng sect, he grasped and memorized the location of the Qingcheng sect and the arrangement of the warriors. After that, as soon as he returned to the guest house, he transferred what he had remembered to the map.If negotiations with the Qingcheng sect went well, this map would have been of no use.\u00a0However, the negotiations with the Qingcheng sect broke down, and they joined hands with the Emei sect, so this map will be useful.\u201cThese three gates at the beginning of Mt. Qingcheng is a problem, and the Black Cloud Mercenary Group can\u2019t use their powers at these gates. In order to effectively use the two hundred cavalry members, we need to bring them down the mountain.\u201dHe devised a plan supposing an all-out war with the Qingcheng sect.Yang Woo-jeong, who looked at the map for a long time, frowned.He suddenly put his hand in his arms and swung it towards the ceiling.Poverbuck!Three throwing knives pierced the ceiling and hit the roof.Yang Woo-jung looked at the throwing knives to the ceiling. However, no strange traces were found anywhere.Yang Woo-jeong pulled up his internal energy and looked closely at every corner. But nothing was found.He muttered as he retrieved the weapons stuck from the roof.\u201cAm I being overly sensitive? I felt someone staring. Maybe I\u2019m mistaken because I\u2019m on edge.\u201dYang Woo-jeong went down. He then stared at the map again, and began to devise a strategy.That was then.Pyo-wol slowly appeared from a corner of the ceiling.The gaze that Yang Woo-jeong felt was not an illusion.Pyo-wol looked at the map from the same point of view right above Yang Woo-jeong\u2019s head. Yang Woo-jeong did not manage to feel Pyo-wol\u2019s gaze because the time he spent looking at the map was getting too long.Yang Woo-jeong hit the ceiling with his knives, but did not notice the presence of Pyo-wol, who was now hiding right in front of him. Even when Pyo-wol was right in front of him, Yang Woo-jeong failed to detect him.His eyes weren\u2019t wrong. It\u2019s just that Pyo-wol\u2019s stealth and assimilation skills were so good.Pyo-wol never left, and even looked directly into Yang Woo-jeong\u2019s eyes. Still, Yang Woo-jeong did not notice Pyo-wol\u2019s existence at all.Yang Woo-jeong went ahead with the plan, unaware that Pyo-wol was still watching.\u201cI did it.\u201dAfter some time had passed, Pyo-wol escaped.Pyo-wol, who decided that there was nothing more to gain from Yang Woo-jeong, immediately returned to the guest house where he was staying.In the guest house, Maun and his companions were still monitoring his room. However, they did not notice that Pyo-wol had returned from going out.Pyo-wol organized his thoughts based on the information he had gathered overnight.\u201cThe total number of men is three hundred and fifty, of which two hundred are cavalry. As cavalry, they are particularly good at fighting in an open place.\u201dThe biggest benefit he got after spying on them was finding out that the Black Cloud Mercenary Group was on the same side as the Emei sect.The fact that a prestigious sect, the Emei sect, chose to ally themselves with a group of rogues such as the Black Cloud Mercenary Group, meant that they were in a predicament.Pyo-wol thought things were going to be fun.It wasn\u2019t his direct intention, but various circumstances intertwined, creating a situation that could not be predicted even one inch ahead.Although this situation would not be desirable for sects such as the Qingcheng sect and the Emei sect, this kind of chaotic situation that could create various variables was very advantageous for the assassin Pyo-wol.The atmosphere he wanted was ripening.Now just throw the embers and they will explode on their own.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

To stay in a room with a face like that. If it were me, I would have seduced a girl who passed by and went to my bedroom. Is there a girl who won\u2019t fall over if I have a face like that?\u201dPyo-wol had a very handsome face that even a man could appreciate. No, he had an atmosphere that could not be expressed by simply calling him handsome.It\u2019s a glamorous atmosphere that seems to attract people just by looking at him.In fact, among the women who came to eat at the guest house, there were many who talked to Pyo-wol.All of them, with their faces blushing, twisted their bodies and handed a letter to Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol was good to them. He didn\u2019t say a word of dislike. He just stared at them indifferently. Nevertheless, the women liked that they received the attention of Pyo-wol.Such a scene was repeated several times, to the point that Maun had a stomach ache.Maun\u2019s face wasn\u2019t too bad either. He thought he belonged to a pretty decent category. But when he spoke to the women, they were often frightened and ran away as if he had a plague.No woman ever showed him a warm smile, or at least not sent him contemptible glances enough to make him feel good.As Maun, who had only had such an experience in comparison to Pyo-wol, he had no choice but to be dissatisfied.\u201cAnyway, women don\u2019t know real men. Men aren\u2019t just their faces.\u201dAlthough Maun grumbled, he did not take his eyes off Pyo-wol. However, the vigilance on his face had softened a lot.For the past four days, Pyo-wol has not taken any action. He didn\u2019t meet anyone else, and he didn\u2019t come into contact with any other sects.\u00a0Just in case, Maun even asked the waiter to check whether Pyo-wol was in the room several times. Maun thought that Pyo-wol\u2019s daily life would be repeated as long as there were no incidents.\u00a0Still, since Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s command was still ongoing, he continued to monitor, but his attention began to loosen little by little.It was the same for colleagues who were watching from the other side.They\u2019d rather follow Pyo-wol when he goes out, even if it\u2019s windy, but because he\u2019s still stuck in the corner of the room, they too had to stay in the corner of the room.\u201cThat man doesn\u2019t even go out, what is he doing?\u201d\u201cHow long do we have to watch?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know! If there\u2019s any movement, tell me then. I\u2019ll close my eyes for a while.\u201dIn the end, there was even a person lying on the bed and closing their eyes while watching. But no one said anything to him. Because everyone else felt the same way.Everyone slowly closed their eyes.\u00a0Maun and his other colleagues too\u2026\u00a0Then at that time, Pyo-wol began to move.Late at night, Pyo-wol quietly left the guesthouse.Four men were watching, but no one noticed Pyo-wol\u2019s movement. If it was simply sneaking out of the guest house, he could do it at any time. Because Pyowol\u2019s stealth was at a level that Maun and his companions could never notice.What Pyo-wol was aiming for was to instill in them a false preconceived notion that he would not move. So, he pretended not to know that they were using a waiter to check that he was still in the room.As such things were repeated for four days, Maun and others\u2019 alertness went down. Pyo-wol knows that human concentration does not last very long.As expected by Pyo-wol, Maun and his colleagues were focused only on the first and second days, while starting from the third day they started to loosened up. And when four days had passed, they were completely relaxed.Their concentration and tension are now completely gone.The first requirement of a good assassin is that he must be able to lower the enemy\u2019s vigilance and be patient until then. To an assassin, a moment when the enemy was relaxed was a golden opportunity to deliver a fatal blow.For Pyo-wol, now was such a moment.He moved on the roof of the pavilion at a frightening speed.The destination was the White Flower Room, a sect consisting of women in the south of the city. The location of the White Flower Room was known in advance through Woo Seolha.Thanks to this, Pyo-wol was able to arrive near the White Flower Room without getting lost in the crowded Chengdu.The size of the White Flower Room was very large.Just as Golden Gates grew up with the support of the Qingcheng sect, the White Flower Room also received support from the Emei sect.\u00a0Dozens of pavilions that soared above the high wall showed how powerful the White Flower Room was in the south of the city.The female disciples stood guard at the front door of the White Flower Room. However, their posture was very relaxed.Still, it was because of the pride that the White Flower Room is a well-known sect in Sichuan, so no one would dare to attack it. Even if someone attacked, they did not worry too much because if the emergency bell rang, the masters inside would come pouring out.Their negligence was a great opportunity for Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol hid in the White Flower Room, avoiding people\u2019s eyes at once.It was the first time he had come to the White Flower Room, but Pyo-wol was already familiar with the topography of the area, the arrangement of personnel, and the location of the military headquarters.It was thanks to Seolha.Pyo-wol remembered all the words she had said inadvertently.Pyo-wol looked at the leftmost front building. It was an empty guest hall that was opened only when important guests came to the White Flower Room. It was now being used by the disciples from the Emei sect.Pyo-wol went up to the roof of the empty audience at once. Emei\u2019s disciples were on the alert around the empty audience hall, but they did not notice the presence of the Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol jumped on one of the tiles on the roof and infiltrated into the pavilion.* * *\u00a0\u201cJunior sister should return to the main sect as soon as the sun rises.\u201d\u201cSenior sister!\u201dAt Jeonghwa\u2019s cold words, Yong Seol-ran looked at her in surprise. It was completely unexpected for her.\u201cEven if Junior sister is here anyway, there is nothing you can do. It would be better for you to go back to the main sect and stay by master\u2019s side.\u201d\u201cBut, Master ordered me to help.\u201d\u201cIf we hadn\u2019t signed a contract with the Black Cloud Mercenary Group, of course I would have received the help of Junior sister. But the contract with the Black Cloud Mercenary Group went well, and there\u2019s nothing for Junior sister to do anymore. So go back.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d\u201cJunior sister! Aret you not going to listen to my orders?\u201dJeonghwa\u2019s voice grew colder.Yong Seol-ran looked at Jeonghwa without saying a word for a moment.\u2018Haaa!\u2019Yong Seol-ran was about to let out a sigh. She\u2019s known for a long time that Jeonghwa was terrified of her.Yong Seol-ran never showed any signs of becoming the sect leader. She hadn\u2019t even thought of that. Still, Jeonghwa was wary of Yong Seol-ran as a potential competitor.No matter how much Yong Seol-ran expressed that she had no intention of being the sect leader, Jeonghwa did not believe her.In one of the eyes of Jeonghwa, the feelings of distrust and hatred toward the Yong Seol-ran were visible.Yong Seol-ran forcibly suppressed a sigh and opened her mouth.\u201cWe don\u2019t know when we will face the Qingcheng sect in Chengdu, so shouldn\u2019t I stay here?\u201d\u201cWhat are you so worried about? The White Flower Room will help us here. If that doesn\u2019t work, we can use the Black Cloud Mercenary Group as a shield. There\u2019s no need for Junior sister to be here. That\u2019s just a huge waste of human resources.\u201d\u201cSenior sister!\u201d\u201cNo matter what my junior sister says, my intentions will not change. I will send a separate letter to Master, so you can go back safely.\u201d\u201cOkay. If it\u2019s Senior sister\u2019s will then\u2014\u201dIn the end, Yong Seol-ran accepted Jeonghwa\u2019s opinion. It was because she realized that no matter how much she objected, Jeonghwa would not accept it.\u00a0If she continues to argue with Jeonghwa over this, in the end, all their conversations will come back to the beginning.\u201cGo back as soon as the sun rises tomorrow.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do that.\u201dYong Seol-ran got up and went outside.Jeonghwa looked at Yong Seol-ran\u2019s back with her remaining eye.Tak!When the door finally closed, she vomited out the words he had been wanting to say for a long time.\u201cHong! That cheeky bitch. How dare you act like that in front of me.\u201dJeonghwa hated Yong Seol-ran the most in the Emei sect. Just being in the same room with her was considered terrifying to the point of shuddering.Although she hated Yong Seol-ran from the moment she first entered, her hatred reached its peak after she lost one eye to an assassin seven years ago.Even before the loss of her eyes could go away, she was greatly scolded by her teacher, Guhwasata, the Abbess of Nine Calamities.The reason was that the relationship with the Qingcheng sect was worsened by not handling the assassin properly. As a result, she was almost exiled for two years.If the conflict with the Qingcheng sect escalated and no electric power was needed, she would have had to spend her whole life in the small hermitage of Mount Emei.It was such a dramatic comeback, but her anxiety did not go away.She couldn\u2019t sleep well because she thought that one day she might be abandoned as a hermitage again. Anxiety turned into hatred, and the hatred turned to Yong Seol-ran, who had gone into the underground cavity with her.Because she took responsibility for everything and was exiled to a small hermitage, while Yong Seol-ran was not punished at all.It was unfair for Yong Seol-ran, but her hatred was too great to change Jeonghwa\u2019s heart.That was then.\u201cAuntie! May I go inside?\u201dA familiar voice was heard outside. The frost-like energy that stood on Jeonghwa\u2019s face disappeared, and a smile took over.\u201cYes. Come in.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201dHearing the answer, Seonha entered the room. She walked lightly and came right in front of Jeonghwa.\u201cI saw Yong Seol-ran come out. Did you ask her to leave?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou did well. I was uncomfortable with her staying here too.\u201d\u201cCertainly, Junior sister has a unique atmosphere that makes others uncomfortable. I don\u2019t like her atmosphere either.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dShe smiled softly and nodded her head.\u201cBut what\u2019s going on for you to visit?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just here to talk to my aunt because I\u2019m afraid my aunt will become enemies.\u201d\u201cHow can you be so nice?\u201dJeonghwa looked at Seolha with a satisfied expression on her face. She sat close to Jeonghwa\u2019s side and showed her aegyo.\u201cAre you with a man? You seem to be more beautiful.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you meet someone. Just don\u2019t give out your heart. The men of the family are unbelievable, so if you give them all of your heart, only you will be hurt.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cHo-ho! It seems that there is a man you are dating.\u201d\u201cThere is, but he\u2019s worth using.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dJeonghwa showed curiosity. Then, Seon-ha was excited and explained.\u201cYou know that the young master of the Thunder Gates is dead, right?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that why we came out? But what\u2019s the connection?\u201d\u201cThe person who killed Nam Ho-san might be the person I met.\u201d\u201cAre you sure?\u201dThe atmosphere of Jeonghwa has changed. Because it was such a shocking story.\u201cIt\u2019s not certain.\u201d\u201cThen why are you talking like that?\u201dIn fact, she wasn\u2019t even sure that Pyo-wol killed Nam Ho-san. Because Pyo-wol didn\u2019t agree to the deed until the end. She assumed he had killed him, but there was no evidence.\u201cI\u2019ll check it out first.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re sure, I\u2019ll bring him to aunt then.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s your idea\u2026 But what\u2019s his name?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll tell you when the time comes.\u201d\u201cJeonghwa!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because I don\u2019t want to make a mistake with my aunt. I\u2019ll tell you when I\u2019m sure.\u201d\u201cOkay. I hope it\u2019s not too late.\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t take that long.\u201d\u201cThen do it.\u201d\u201cThank you, Auntie!\u201dSeolha smiled.This is because Jeonghwa, who was so harsh on the other disciples of the Emei sect, was infinitely merciful to her.All of a sudden, Pyo-wol came to mind.\u2018Did he really kill him?\u2019They have already slept together twice. Still, the fact that she couldn\u2019t fully understand his true feelings made her scared. She felt like she was haunted.Jeonghwa, who saw Seolha\u2019s hard face, made a puzzled expression.\u201cWhy was that\u2026\u201dAt that moment.\u201cKyaa-ak!\u201d\u201cCollection!\u201dSuddenly, a tearing scream was heard from outside. Jeonghwa and Seolha looked at each other in surprise. They rushed out to run to the place where the scream was heard.It was the room opposite Jeonghwa\u2019s dwelling.Several Emei sect\u2019s disciples had already gathered in front of the room. Their complexions were pale white.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cOh, Gongseon\u2019s private house\u2014!\u201dThe Emei sect\u2019s disciples were unable to speak.Jeonghwa pushed them away and entered the room.A woman was lying in the room as if asleep. She was Gongseon, a direct disciple of Jeonghwa. Gongseon was one of the two great disciples of the Emei sect, and was taught by Jeonghwa.So she called Jeonghwa Master, and Jeong-hwa also considered her to be her direct disciple.\u201cGongseon!\u201dJeonghwa hurriedly hugged Gongseon.At that moment, Gongseon\u2019s neck ripped open, and fresh blood flowed down like a waterfall and wet Jeonghwa\u2019s chest.\u201cNo! This can\u2019t be! Who the hell did this to Gongseon\u2014\u201dRed blood stood in Jeonghwa\u2019s one and only eye.\u201cQing, Qingcheng sect! They\u2019re the ones who sent an assassin to kill junior sister Gongseon!\u201d\u201cWe must take revenge now.\u201dThe Emei sect\u2019s disciples demanded revenge.Gongseon resembles Jeonghwa and has a toxic personality. So she also bought a lot of resentment from the other disciples. But that was the story while she was still alive.As long as she was a disciple belonging to the same sect, they had to take revenge no matter what her personal circumstances were.Jeonghwa muttered while holding Gongseon\u2019s body.\u201cQingcheng sect! I will never forgive you. I\u2019ll make sure to kill all of you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 64": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 64Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayGongseon\u2019s death soon became known throughout the White Flower Room.It was not an issue that they could hide. And Jeonghwa also had no intention of hiding the news. Jeonghwa was more angry than anyone at Gongseon\u2019s death.She summoned her former disciples and ordered them to prepare for war.If it were the usual, she would have informed her master, the Abbess of Nine Calamities, and asked for permission. But it was impossible for her, who is now blinded by revenge, to think logically.\u00a0The Emei sect and the White Flower Room immediately entered a wartime stance.It was Yong Seol-ran who was most perplexed by the sudden situation.Yong Seol-ran, who had been preparing to return to the Emei sect for a while, ran to Gongseon\u2019s residence. Gongseon\u2019s corpse was cleaned up, but the traces of the blood she shed remained.Yong Seol-ran looked at the bloodstains on the floor for a moment, then looked around.\u2018Where the hell did the assassin infiltrate?\u2019No matter how much she thought about it, the only place the assassin could enter was the ceiling.Yong Seol-ran flew and climbed up the girders.\u00a0If an assassin had infiltrated this place, there would certainly be traces of it. However, no matter how much Yong Seol-ran turned on the light and searched, no trace of the assassin was found.There was dust piled up on the girder.If anyone had been up here, there should have been some smashed marks of dust.But no such trace was found anywhere.\u201cThen where did he infiltrate?\u201dAfter that, she spent a long time looking for a place where the assassin might have infiltrated. However, no trace was found anywhere.\u201cHow?\u201dYong Seol-ran felt goosebumps rising up her spine. It was the first time she felt such emotions since that day, seven years ago.\u201cCould it be him? No! He\u2019s definitely dead. The Qingcheng sect\u2019s Mu Jeong-jin definitely finished him off.\u201dAgave denied her imagination.* * *Gongseon\u2019s death was also passed on to the Black Cloud Mercenary Group.Now that they are on the same ship sharing a common destiny, Zhang Mu-ryang reacted more sensitively to Gongseon\u2019s death than anyone else.\u201cA great disciple was assassinated? Adirect disciple of Jeonghwa, who is a key figure in the Emei sect, that kind of person was assassinated? Furthermore, within the confines of the White Flower Room?\u201dWhen Zhang Mu-ryang first heard the news, he thought it was absurd.The White Flower Room might be made up of women, but it was a sect that could never be looked down on. Moreover, with the full support of the Emei sect, the level of force each disciple had was beyond normal.Of course, the security of the White Flower Room was also strict.Infiltrating a place with such strict security without leaving a trace and taking a life of a disciple in public? Even Zhang Mu-ryang himself couldn\u2019t do that.\u201cIt\u2019s impossible unless you\u2019re an assassin with professional training.\u201d\u201cAs far as I know, there are no assassins who have reached that kind of level in Sichuan.\u201d\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\u201cSince the collapse of the Blood Shadow Group seven years ago, a new group of assassins has not come down in Sichuan Province.\u201dYang Woo-jeong answered in a confident tone.\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cIt may be possible for the assassins of Hundred Wraith Union, but they are not active even in the distant Sichuan Province.\u201cYeah. There\u2019s no reason for them to intervene in the Sichuan conflict.\u201dZhang Mu-ryang shook his head.Hundred Wraith Union was the number one assassin group in Jianghu. They appeared suddenly after the War of Demons and Heavens and succeeded in the quest that everyone said was impossible.\u00a0Once anyone becomes their target, no one would survive.As assassins of the Hundred Wraith Union, they said that even if their target hides in a place like Cheolongseong1, they can always find them and kill them.However, their field of activity was thoroughly fixed at the center of Jianghu. No evidence has been found that they have been active in Sichuan for at least several years.\u201cThen who is it? Did the Qingcheng sect really send an assassin?\u201d\u201cThe Qingcheng sect is a prestigious faction that everyone knows. Even though they say they are in a dispute, hiring an assassin against the Emei sect is not in line with the Qingcheng sect\u2019s philosophy. They would rather moved directly than hiring an assassin or else their reputation will fall.\u201d\u201cHm!\u201dYang Woo-jeong\u2019s words made sense, so Zhang Mu-ryang could only uttered a muffled voice. Hiring an assassin is easy, but if the truth is found out, the Qingcheng sect will be criticized by Jianghu.It was too risky for a prestigious sect, such as a Qingcheng sect, to choose.The harm was far greater than the gain.No matter how much he thought about it, it was unlikely that the Qingcheng sect would have hired an assassin.\u201cThen who? Did a third party intervene?\u201dZhang Mu-ryang felt a strong sense of crisis.One of the reasons he survived long rolls on the battlefield was the insight he gained from his many experiences. His insight, which produced the best results by instantaneously combining instinct and reason, was close to the level of prophecy.Thanks to this, he was able to detect a crisis in advance and escape from many dangers.Now his insight was warning of a crisis.At that moment, there was a figure that popped into Zhang\u2019s mind.\u201cCall Maun right now.\u201d\u201cAre you saying Maun?\u201d\u201cYeah! Right now.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dYang Woo-jeong immediately executed Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s orders.After a while, Maun, who was watching Pyo-wol from the guest house came in.\u201cDid you call for me, Captain?.\u201d\u201cWhat did he do last night?\u201d\u201cAre you referring to the first-class surveillance target?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHe not once left the guest house.\u201d\u201cHave you not missed any of his movements?\u201d\u201cFour people took turns monitoring. But none of them detected any anomalies.\u201d\u201cReally? You never took your eyes off of him?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true. In the last four days, he\u2019s never been out of the room. He only goes out of his room for dinner.\u201dAt Maun\u2019s answer, Zhang Mu-ryang frowned.\u2018Does he really have nothing to do with this incident?\u2019Then Maun said cautiously,\u00a0\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t know why I should be monitoring him. In the last four days, he hasn\u2019t been out of the guest house even once. He also never had any contact with outsiders. I don\u2019t see any reason to monitor him anymore.\u201dMaun omitted the story that he was unable to detect Pyo-wol presence while he was in the room. If he did, it would seemed like Maun was revealing his own incompetence.Without knowing that, Zhang Mu-ryang asked.\u201cIs there any chance he noticed your presence?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s almost impossible. No, it\u2019s impossible. As you know, we don\u2019t make mistakes in this kind of thing. That\u2019s why you entrusted us with this mission, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cHuuu!\u201dZhang Mu-ryang let out a sigh.\u2018Is it not really him? No! Something is still strange. For him to not go out for four days? Is that possible?\u2019Zhang Mu-ryang felt a strong sense of incongruity. However, he did not know exactly what the source of his feelings was.\u2018There\u2019s no point in monitoring him any more than this.\u2019Maun and his colleagues had already lost their motivation. If they continue to monitor Pyo-wol in their current state, they will not be able to concentrate and they will not get the results Zhang Mu-ryang wanted.Above all, now was the time to strengthen their surveillance on the Qingcheng sect.\u201cMaun!\u201d\u201cYes, Captain!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s put on hold observing the top-level monitoring targets for the time being, and focus on identifying the movements of the Qingcheng sect.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dMaun answered in a loud voice. Now he thought he had done his job properly. The last four days have been difficult for him. It was the first time he realized that monitoring can be so tedious and difficult.That was then.\u201cSir!\u201dA voice was heard from the outside.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cA messenger has come from the Emei sect.\u201d\u201cMessenger?\u201d\u201cYes! They\u2019re asking you to come into the White Flower Room right now.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dZhang Mu-ryang realized that the time has come. He got up from his seat and said to Yang Woo-jeong.\u201cBe prepared for any fight at any time.\u201d\u201cOkay, Captain! Don\u2019t worry and go.\u201d\u201cHm!\u201dZhang Wu Liang nodded and went outside. Outside, the Emei sect\u2019s messenger was waiting for him. Things were becoming more urgent than he thought.\u00a0Zhang Mu-ryang brought Yang Woo-jeong and the Go Dosa into the White Flower Room. The White Flower Room was bright as daylight because of the numerous lanterns illuminating the area.The Emei sect and all the disciples of the White Flower Room thoroughly searched the area to catch the beast that killed Gongseon.\u00a0However, no traces of the assassin were found anywhere.It is not even known how the assassin infiltrated. Because of that, the entire White Flower Room was turned upside down.Go Dosa whispered.\u201cThis looks serious. I don\u2019t know if we boarded the wrong ship or not. But we can\u2019t go back now\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s more of a good thing for us. If this happens, they\u2019ll depend on us a lot, so we\u2019ll be able to get more out of it.\u201d\u201cI guess so too. But we have to be careful.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dZhang Mu-ryang nodded and moved forward.He could feel the stinging gaze of the White Flower Room and the Emei sect\u2019s disciples.Some even looked at them with hostility.The Black Cloud Mercenary Group and the assassin had nothing to do with each other, but just because they were outsiders, they received their wrath.Zhang Mu-ryang and his party went to the audience hall under the guidance of a disciple of Emei.\u201cOthers are waiting here, please go inside alone, Captain Zhang.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dZhang Mu-ryang meekly followed the instructions of the Emei disciple. He told Yang Woo-jeong and Go Dosa to stay, and went into the empty auditorium.Another disciple of Emei was waiting for him in the empty audience. She led Zhang Mu-ryang to the largest room in the guest hall.In the room were Jeonghwa, Seonha, and a middle-aged woman who looked elegant. The middle-aged woman was Geum Ha-ryeon, the ark of the White Flower Room.In front of them lay an object covered with a white cloth. Zhang Mu-ryang recognized that it was a corpse because of the smell of blood.Jeonghwa was desperate and immediately went on to business,\u201cCaptain Zhang. A disciple of our sect was attacked by an assassin.\u201d\u201cI have heard the news.\u201d\u201cI called you to see the scars of my disciple.\u201d\u201cWhy me?\u201d\u201cAt first I thought it was just a swordsman.\u201d\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cIf you can see it for yourself, you\u2019ll see why I\u2019m doing this.\u201dJeonghwa pointed to the corpse covered in white cloth.Zhang Mu-ryang frowned and held up the white cloth. Then, Gongseon\u2019s body appeared, with her neck half split.Gongseon looked peaceful as if she died while sleeping. She had shed so much blood and had been dead for quite some time, so she was pale but she had no painful expression on her face.Zhang Mu-ryang carefully examined Gongseon\u2019s neck wound.As time passed, Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s face stiffened.\u2018What is this?\u2019It was then that he understood why Jeonghwa had said that.\u00a0The wounds of Gongseon were smooth.\u00a0\u00a0It was sharply cut as if looking at a cross section of glass. At first glance, it may seem that the wound was from the use of an ordinary sword, but he knew from experience that a sword could never inflict such a wound.\u2018What? Not a sword or a dagger. Is it some kind of gift? But no matter how sharp a gift is, it would not be able to prevent the skin from curling up.\u2019Zhang Mu-ryiang felt goosebumps rising all over his body.He spent most of his life on the battlefield. He naturally saw a lot of corpses, and confirmed that many wounds with his own eyes. But none of the wounds he saw were as smooth as the cut on Gongseon\u2019s neck.\u2018Isn\u2019t this\u2026 isn\u2019t this an art in itself? The art of death.\u2019But he didn\u2019t put his thoughts out of his mouth.It was because Jeonghwa was staring at him with scary eyes even at this moment. She asked,\u201cHave you ever seen a wound like this?\u201d\u201cHonestly\u2026 no.\u201d\u201cEven for someone as experienced as you, you\u2019ve never seen this kind of wound before?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dAt Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s answer, Jeong-hwa\u2019s impression became more venomous.\u201cDisappointing!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t say that know things when in fact I don\u2019t know\u2014\u201d\u201cDo you have any guesses?\u201dAt that moment, Zhang Mu-ryang remembered Pyo-wol.He had a strong feeling that he was somehow related to this case. However, Maun and his colleagues who were monitoring Pyo-wol said they did not see him move. In the end, there was no evidence anywhere that he was involved in this case.\u201cI\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t give you the answer you wanted.\u201d\u201cOkay. I didn\u2019t expect much from you.\u201dFor a moment, Zhang Mu-ryang felt a rush of irritation.\u2018Then why the hell did you call me?\u2019With superhuman patience, Zhang Mu-ryang suppressed the swearing that was rising through his throat. Whether or not she knew that fact, Jeonghwa continued.\u201cWhen will the rest of your troops arrive in Chengdu?\u201d\u201cWe will gather all of them within two days. But if the cavalry enters the city, the Qingcheng sect will be on alert immediately.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. We just have to trample them before they start on being on the lookout.\u201d\u201cAre you going to start an all-out war right now?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give you enough compensation.\u201d\u201cBut you have to make a plan first\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is what I, the next sect leader of the Emei sect, have decided. Are you sure you won\u2019t listen to my orders?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 I see.\u201dZhang Mu-ryang had no choice but to agree. The Black Cloud Mercenary Group had already signed a contract with the Emei sect.Before breaking the contract, they had to obey their orders. If they recklessly cancel the contract, from that moment on, no one in Jianghu will trust the Black Cloud Mercenary Group.In the end, Zhang Mu-ryang had no choice. Jeonghwa\u2019s voice resounded through his ears.\u201cI swear I will never live under the same sky as the Qingcheng sect.\u201dEveryone in the room trembled.It is said that if a woman harbors a grudge, frost can fall even in May and June.2\u00a0Even more so for Jeonghwa was considered to be the next sect leader of the Emei sect.\u00a0As long as she wills it, she can cause a snow storm even during summer.\u00a0The people shuddered.So they didn\u2019t manage to hear.Srreuk!The faint sound that was emanating from the ceiling.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Below him, Jeonghwa, Geum Ha-ryeon, and Zhang Mu-ryang were meeting to discuss countermeasures.The great masters of Sichuan had gathered in one place, but they all failed to notice that Pyo-wol was in the same space as them.In the first place, Pyo-wol never left the White Flower Room. Even when the White Flower Room and the Emei sect\u2019s martial artists searched the place, he didn\u2019t move even a single step from his spot.Some warriors even searched near where Pyo-wol was sitting. But they still did not notice the presence of Pyo-wol and just passed by.Pyo-wol watched everything from his spot.The level of response of the White Flower Room.The decisions of the Emei sect\u2019s warriors.The conversation between Jeonghwa and her disciples.And even the meeting with Zhang Mu-ryang.Pyo-wol watched it all from start to finish.Among them, Pyp-wol particularly focused on Jeonghwa. A long time has passed, but Pyo-wol still clearly remembers her. He took away one of Jeonghwa\u2019s eyes with his own hand, so it would not be strange for him to remember her.\u00a0She was the one who tenaciously pursued Pyo-wol.They betrayed and attacked the group they had asked for commission, which caused the annihilation of the Blood Shadow Group.Pyo-wol didn\u2019t have any affection for the Blood Shadow Group, but he wanted to make sure they paid the price for what they did at that time.\u00a0That\u2019s why he found it difficult to go back.He could just sneak in and kill Jeonghwa at once. But that would be too much of a comfortable death for Jeonghwa.She should never die easily.\u00a0She has to live to the end and see the results of what she has done.So Pyo-wol killed her disciple, Gongseon, instead of Jeonghwa. Some would accuse him of killing an innocent person, but Pyo-wol didn\u2019t mind the public\u2019s accusations.Jianghu was the kind of place where people die and kill all the time.The romantic Jianghu, where strangers met and shared friendships, had long since disappeared. And Pyo-wol\u2019s emotions were too dry to talk about romance and friendship.Srreuk!Pyo-wol left the room without a sound, similar to a snake. Until then, no one, both inside and outside of the room, had detected Pyo-wol\u2019s existence.The White Flower Room and the Emei sect\u2019s disciples said that they would closely guard the area, but they failed to notice Pyo-wol\u2019s escape.After leaving the White Flower Room Pyo-wol returned to his residence without a sound. He no longer felt the gaze of Maun and his colleagues. Pyo-wol noticed that their surveillance on him had stopped.Pyo-wol took a bath in a relaxed mood after a long time. He spent a relaxing time soaking in the warm water.\u00a0Then, suddenly, he looked at his hand.As he operated his qi, the Soul-Reaping Thread formed on the tip of his finger.It was Suhoonsa that took Gongseon\u2019s life.He ended Gongseon\u2019s breath by operating the Soul-Reaping Thread like a noose. Although there was only a single line of thread that could be used at will, its power was terrifying. More so than he thought.Gongseon didn\u2019t even know how she died. She just stopped breathing. That was Pyo-wol\u2019s last mercy to the Emei sect.After bathing, Pyo-wol went out and put on his clothes.After putting on the belt containing the ghost knives, he came down to the dining room on the first floor.\u201cAre you going out?\u201dAs Pyo-wol sat down, the waiter ran again.\u201cGive me a quick bite to eat.\u201d\u201cYes! Please wait a minute.\u201dThe waiter ran towards the kitchen like a squirrel.\u00a0The inside of the guest house was quiet. Most of the guests had already finished their meal and left. Thanks to this, Pyo-wol was able to enjoy a leisurely meal after a long time.The breakfast was quite delicious. Since the hostess paid his food some special attention, Pyo-wol was able to enjoy a satisfying meal. Pyo-wol drank tea and enjoyed the morning leisurely.The whole city was buzzing about what he had done, but here he was drinking tea while enjoying the sunshine and the wind.Pyo-wol who was enjoying tea with his eyes half-closed was like a painting in itself. Everyone was busy moving, but he alone seemed to have his time stopped.Pyo-wol fully enjoyed some time alone after a long time. He passed time by drinking tea, looking at the scenery outside, and watching people passing by.The peace was broken when Pyo-wol took his last sip and was about to get up.\u201cHandsome oraboni.\u201dSomeone approached, calling him.\u00a0 There was only one person who would call him that.\u2018Heo Ran-ju.\u2019When he turned my head to the direction the voice came from, he saw Heo Ran-ju approaching.\u201cCan I sit down?\u201dHeo Ran-ju sat down as she asked for permission. When Pyo-wol looked at her without saying a word, Heo Ran-ju laughed and said,\u201cYou\u2019re still handsome.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here just to see how you are. I also want to apologize.\u201d\u201cApologize?\u201d\u201cThe captain was rude that day. Were you very embarrassed?\u201d\u201cNot at all.\u201dHeo Ran-ju narrowed her eyes at Pyo-wol\u2019s answer.As she recalled the memories of that day, shame came over her again. However, she looked at Pyo-wol without showing her inner feelings.\u00a0With Heo Ran-ju in front of him, Pyo-wol did not show much emotion.\u2018Is it not him?\u2019In fact, she suspected that Pyo-wol was the one who killed Gongseon which was why she came to see him.This was a case where a second generation disciple of the Emei sect had died. Naturally, all the martial artists in Sichuan were considered suspects. Pyo-wol included.Heo Ran-ju tried to find traces of last night\u2019s murder in Pyo-wol. It was not a reasonable doubt.\u00a0Maybe it was because of her injured self-esteem. But even so, Heo Ran-ju was still obsessed with Pyo-wol.Heo Ran-ju couldn\u2019t understand her own reaction. This was the first time she had been so obsessed with a man.\u2018It\u2019s like being possessed by a ghost.\u2019A light of desire appeared in Heo Ran-ju\u2019s eyes. Heo Ran-ju, who looked at Pyo-wol for a moment, gathered up the courage and opened her mouth.\u201cHandsome oraboni. Why don\u2019t you think about it again?\u201d\u201cAbout what?\u201d\u201cOur captain\u2019s proposal.\u201d\u201cYou want me to join the Black Cloud Mercenary Group?\u201d\u201cYes! I\u2019ll take good care of you.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cUh, I can do anything!\u201d\u201cAnything?\u201d\u201cYeah, anything you can imagine.\u201dHeo Ran-ju\u2019s expression became seducing. No matter how ignorant the man was, there was no way he could not know what her expression meant. However, Heo Ran-ju could not hear Pyo-wol\u2019s answer.\u201cHuh! You left me without saying a word. So you\u2019re here!\u201dSuddenly, a loud voice was heard. The people in the guest house covered their ears, distressed at the voice that seemed to be ringing.Heo Ran-ju\u2019s eyes became cold.It was because she realized the identity of the uninvited guest who intervened at an important moment. When she turned her head, a man with a large body was standing at the entrance of the guest house.\u201cOh Yuk-pyo!\u201d\u201cHeh heh heh!\u201d\u201cDid you chase after me?\u201d\u201cChase you? I came here because the captain asked me to call you.\u201dOh Yuk-pyo, along with Heo Ran-ju, was a member of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group.He was having a conversation with Heo Ran-ju, but the gaze of Oh Yuk-pyo was fixed on Pyo-wol.In an instant, Heo Ran-ju\u2019s expression changed completely. It was because she remembered the fact that Oh Yuk-pyo enjoyed sodomy.\u201cIs that man Pyo-wol? He\u2019s as handsome as I\u2019ve heard. Really handsome. Hehe!\u201dA red aura gleamed in Oh Yuk-pyo\u2019s eyes. Heo Ran-ju knew what that meant.\u201cDon\u2019t be greedy.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean greedy?\u201d\u201cOh Yuk-pyo!\u201d\u201cWhat kind of greed do you think I\u2019m greedy for?\u201dIn spite of the loud voice of Heo Ran-ju, Oh Yuk-pyo did not seem to care. His gaze was still fixed on Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol is obviously a man, but his sultry appearance and smooth body without a single fat stimulated the lusts of Oh Yuk-pyo.\u2018Killing.\u2019He swallowed his dry saliva.\u201cIf you don\u2019t look away after three seconds, you\u2019ll never see the world with your own two eyes again.\u201dAt that time, Pyo-wol\u2019s cold voice reached the ears of Oh Yuk-pyo. However, Oh Yuk-pyo was not displeased and approached Pyo-Wol.\u201cYou\u2019re going to do what to me now, sweetie?\u201d\u201cOne.\u201d\u201cHe he!\u201d\u201cTwo.\u201d\u201cWhoa, woah! I\u2019m not a scary person.\u201d\u201cThree.\u201dCiit!At that moment, a sharp cracking sound resounded in the guest house. Pyo-wol threw the chopsticks that were placed in front of him.\u201cDamn it!\u201dOh Yuk-pyo concentrated his strength on his arms and covered his face.Pouck!The chopsticks were deep-seated on his forearm because of the strong firing. Because he used his inner qi in time, the chopsticks pierced his forearms, but if he hadn\u2019t the chopsticks would have been stuck in his eyes.\u00a0\u201cYou, you bastard!\u201dOh Yuk-pyo lowered the arm that had covered his face and looked at the table where Pyo-Wol was sitting. However, Pyo-wol was nowhere to be seen.\u201cHuh?\u201dAt that moment, Pyo-wol suddenly appeared in front of him.\u201cNo!\u201dHeo Ran-ju let out a shout\u00a0 and tried to wield the whip she was wearing on her waist. Whatever the circumstances, she couldn\u2019t just watch her colleague Oh Yuk-pyo suffer.She knew just how strong Pyo-wol was because she had fought him herself.The ruthlessness that hides behind his handsome face.However, before Heo Ran-ju could unleash her whip, the desperate screams of the Oh Yuk-pyo rang out.Pouck!Chopsticks were deeply embedded in his right eye.Oh Yuk-pyo, who lost one of his eyes in an instant, roared like a beast and struggled.Bang! Baang!The objects in the guest house were shattered by his struggle, and the guests ran out screaming.\u2018Too late.\u2019Heo Ran-ju gave a disappointed expression.Even with her eyes wide open, she couldn\u2019t see how Pyo-wol had moved from the table and appeared in front of the Oh Yuk-pyo in an instant.Space constraints seemed to be of no obstacle to him. So it felt even more terrifying.\u201cAHHH! I\u2019ll kill you, you bastard!\u201dOh Yuk-pyo was going crazy.\u00a0Everyone was afraid of him, but Pyo-wol was still looking at him with no change in his expression.The fists of Oh Yuk-pyo contained a mighty power, but if it was not right, he could not exert any power.Bueng!The fists of Oh Yuk-pyo were dodged by Pyo-wol by a short distance. Pyo-wol moved his body at a minimum to avoid Oh Yuk-pyo\u2019s fist.Heo Ran-ju felt goosebumps rising as she saw the fists of Oh Yuk-pyo being dodged by a distance of only a single sheet of paper.Pyo-wol was thoroughly fooling around with Oh Yuk-pyo.\u00a0His movements were like a snake. A large snake that slips through even the slightest gap.\u00a0It was then that Heo Ran-ju realized that it was no coincidence that she was suppressed by Pyo-Wol in an instant.\u201cShit!\u201dPyo-wol\u2019s strength was real. Behind his handsome face was an unimaginable cruelty.Heo Ran-ju was\u00a0 proud that she had gone through everything ever since she was a child, but Pyo-wol\u2019s cruelty still made her feel fear.\u00a0A dagger was suddenly in Pyo-wol\u2019s hand.It was the ghost knife.Ciit!The ghost knife pierced Oh Yuk-pyo\u2019s knees. Blood spurted from his knees, and his large body collapsed.\u201cKekkeuk!\u201dOh Yuk-pyo knelt and looked at Pyo-Wol with his remaining eye. There was fear in his eyes. He realized that the man he was trying to use as a plaything was actually the god of death.\u201cUgh! Sa, save me!\u201dOh Yuk-pyo forgot his face and begged for their life. The man he thought was a plaything was a master beyond imagination. Oh Yuk-pyo did not want to die here.\u201cP, please!\u201dHe begged with tears in his eyes. At that moment, Heo Ran-ju swung her whip and intervened between the two of them. The whip wrapped around the waist of Oh Yuk-pyo in an instant.\u201cHeup!\u201dHeo Ran-ju pulled her whip. Then, the large body of Oh Yuk-pyo flew to the other side of the wall.Heo Ran-ju jumped into the air and grabbed Oh Yuk-pyo.\u00a0\u201cYou bastard! I must have intervened at that time\u2013\u201dHeo Ran-ju looked at Oh Yuk-pyo on her side with contempt. She has now abandoned the idea of seducing Pyo-wol.It\u2019s because Oh Yuk-pyo messed up the faintly remaining possibility. Heo Ran-ju took the Oh Yuk-pyo and took refuge on a high roof out of Pyo-wol\u2019s reach.For some reason, Pyo-wol did not pursue, and just looked at her.Heo Ran-ju said to him,\u201cOraboni is really extreme. If you do whatever you want without thinking about it like this, you won\u2019t be able to get out of trouble. So, you\u2019d better be careful in the future.\u201dHeo Ran-ju thought that this incident was just a coincidence.\u00a0An unfortunate accident that happened by chance caused by the collision of Oh Yuk-pyos sodomy habit and Pyo-wol\u2019s radicality.She did not know.The fact that the assassin is never moved by things such as emotion or impulse.\u00a0When an assassin moves, it is only after a complete series of calculations.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 66": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 66Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cWhat do you mean?Zhang Mu-ryang had a distressed expression.After discussing how to use the troops in the White Flower Room, what awaited him when he returned was the news that Oh Yuk-pyo had returned with serious injuries.Zhang Mu-ryang left everything behind and headed to the residence of Oh Yuk-pyo.Oh Yuk-pyo was lying on the bed with a white cloth wrapped around his one eye and both of his knees. Heo Ran-ju was sitting next to him.\u201cHow did this happen?\u201d\u201cWe were unlucky. This bastard broke the colic.\u201dHeo Ran-ju talked about what happened with Pyo-wol. As he listened to her story, Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s expression gradually distorted.\u201cSo, you mean that it came to this point because of his sodomy?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cThis is ridiculous.\u201dZhang Mu-ryang was at a loss for words for a moment. It\u2019s so ridiculous that he could not even speak.At the time before the full-scale war against the Qingcheng sect, Oh Yuk-pyo, one of the main forces, was now lying in bed almost dead.It was a huge loss for the Black Cloud Mercenary Group, but it was more of a serious blow to Zhang Mu-ryang as an individual.Along with Yang Woo-jeong, Go Dosa, and Hyeol Seung, Oh Yuk-pyo was his subordinate who best understood his strategy.They were ready to jump into the hellfire without hesitation at Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s command. It\u2019s not easy to have a subordinate so loyal.\u201cPyo\u2026wol!\u201dZhang Mu-ryang thought of Pyo-wol as the most handsome man he knew.Seeing that he was able to subdue Heo Ran-ju at once, he knew that he was a martial artist who had reached an unusually high level, but he didn\u2019t know that he would be so great that he would turn even Oh Yuk-pyo into this state.\u201cAt a time like this\u2013\u201dZhang Mu-ryang looked at Oh Yuk-pyo lying on the bed with contemptuous eyes.What he valued the most was discipline.The reason why the Black Cloud Mercenary Group was still able to survive was because they enforced strict discipline.Especially in an important time like now, even a single person\u2019s bouncing behavior was unacceptable. This is because if they make a mistake, they may miss the line.\u201cHe\u2019s a lucky guy.\u201dZhang Mu-ryang wanted to immediately lead his entire troops and visit Pyo-wol. And he would pay a heavy price.The only problem is that the Black Cloud Mercenary Group signed a mercenary contract with the Emei sect. If they take a lot of damage while fighting Pyo-wol, they will have a big problem in fulfilling the contract. If that happens, Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s long-cherished entry into Sichuan will be far away.\u2018This wasn\u2019t part of his calculations, did he?\u2019Zhang Mu-ryang immediately denied his thoughts.Only insiders knew that the Black Cloud Mercenary Group had signed a contract with the Emei sect. Zhang Mu-ryang thought this accident was only a coincidence.But of course, that doesn\u2019t mean that they would just move on.\u201cOnce the situation is sorted out to a certain extent, I\u2019ll have to deal with him first.\u201dMost of all, it bothered him the most that this happened as soon as he stopped Maun and others from monitoring him. He knew from experience that he shouldn\u2019t let such an afflicted man be alone.Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s gaze turned to Heo Ran-ju.\u201cDid you go and look for him?\u201d\u201cMaybe.\u201d\u201cYour beauty doesn\u2019t seem to work for him either.\u201d\u201cHe must be a little eunuch. He doesn\u2019t budge even when he sees a beautiful woman like me in front of him.\u201d\u201cHave you seen his eyes? They were more indifferent than ours who had been on the battlefield for many years. Do you think a man with such eyes would show affection to others? Give up!\u201d\u201cI will. I can\u2019t hurt my self-esteem anymore.\u201d\u201cYou thought well.\u201d\u201cI will definitely pay him back for this shame.\u201dHeo Ran-ju\u2019s voice blew out a chill. It is said that if a woman has a grudge, frost will fall even in May or June. Although she had nothing to do with Pyo-wol, she thought that she had been hurt because of him.\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019ll take care of things once everything has calmed down. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cWell, then.\u201dZhang Mu-ryang got up from his seat.This was enough.It was disappointing that the Oh Yuk-pyo fell out of the battlefield, but the rest are still in good health, so it was worth trying.\u201cAs soon as the cavalry move, we will join them, so be prepared.\u201d* * *Cheongyeop looked at the man sitting on the other side of the table with a somber expression.A middle-aged doctor who had an ordinary impression that can be seen anywhere, and was dressed in shabby clothes, was Oh San-kyung, the head of the Chengdu\u2019s branch of Haomun.Oh San-kyung was a native of Chengdu, so he knew the area\u2019s internal affairs better than anyone else. Oh San-kyung opened her mouth carefully.\u201cSo, are you saying this to tell me about the assassin that killed the young master of the Thunder Gates?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cHuh! This is like finding a needle on a sandy beach.\u201d\u201cStill, I think Haomun\u2019s ability is enough to find out.\u201dAt Cheongyeop\u2019s words, Oh San-kyung\u2019s expression twisted slightly.In fact, when Nam Ho-san died, Oh San-kyung also moved his people to find out the assassin.The assassination of the young master of Thunder Gates in Chengdu was such a big event.The problem was that no traces of the assassin were found.Many disciples from Haomun also lived in the mansion near the Thunder Gates. When a stranger comes in, they observe and report them. However, there were no reports on that day.In other words, no stranger visited that day or the people who lived in the mansion did not feel a sense of alienation.Like Cheongyeop, Haomun also did not know anything.\u00a0\u201cI want you to find an assassin who uses the martial arts of the Qingcheng sect.\u201d\u201cThis is a matter of security for Sichuan. The dispute in Sichuan Province may worsen if anything goes wrong. So before that happens, you must find the assassin.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t know that, but\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll ask you bluntly. Have there been any suspicious or prominent people in Chengdu lately?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\u201cAny clue, no matter how small, is fine. That\u2019s how desperate we are.\u201dOh San-kyung was worried at Cheongyeop\u2019s words.\u201cIt is unknown whether it was related to the death of Nam Ho-san but a strange man has recently entered Chengdu.\u201cStrange?\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t seen him in person, but it was said that he\u2019s handsome enough to attract people. Women who have seen him even once seem to be possessed as if they won\u2019t be able to snap back to their senses.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s just that\u2013\u201d\u201cBut he\u2019s strong. Just before entering Chengdu, he had a conflict with the head of the Gujin Pyo-guk, and he turned all of them half-blind. One of them was even made completely blind.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u201d\u201cHis hands were said to be cruel beyond words. Sir Oh Won-ho, a well-known expert in Sichuan Province, also said that the guy broke his arm.\u201d\u2018\u201cHow come we weren\u2019t made aware of such a cruel man?\u201d\u201cBecause he had recently entered Chengdu. And\u2014\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s more?\u201d\u201cThere is a record of him fighting and subduing Heo Ran-ju, the vice captain of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group in Chengdu. I heard that she was defeated instantly.\u201d\u2018Cheongyeop\u2019s expression hardened.He knew that the Black Cloud Mercenary Group was a strong group of mercenaries. They had recently come to do business with the Qingcheng sect. Although the deal fell off, it was still a disappointing negotiation.\u00a0The power of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group could never be taken lightly.If someone was the vice captain of such a group, they would have a fairly strong martial art, but if they were suppressed immediately, it was clear that the opponent\u2019s martial arts were really great.\u201cYou mean he has something to do with the death of the young master of Thunder Gates?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s connected, but he\u2019s definitely the most notable person who has recently entered Chengdu. He\u2019s also the one who checks all the conditions Cheongyeop asked me about.\u201d\u201cWhat is his name?\u201d\u201cThey say it\u2019s a Pyo\u2026wol.\u201d\u201cPyo-wol?\u201d\u201cYes. We don\u2019t know more than that. We\u2019ll investigate further if you wish.\u201d\u201cNo. From now on, we will be the one to take care of it.\u201dCheongyeop got up from his seat. It seemed that there was no information that could be obtained from Haomun if he stayed any longer.Tak!Cheongyeop pulled out a pouch full of money from his arms and laid it down on the table.\u201cThank you, sir Cheongyeop! If you need any help, you can come to me anytime.\u201d\u201cOh! Before we leave, let me ask you one thing. Have you ever visited the Emei sect?\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t been to the Emei sect yet. Maybe in the future.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just saying this because of my old age but, it would be better for you to not to accept the Emei sect\u2019s requests for the time being. Unless you want to turn the Qingcheng sect into an enemy.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201dOh San-kyung smiled slightly and bowed her head towards Cheongyeop.As the branch manager of Haomun, these kinds of threats were not uncommon.It only bothered her that the person who threatened her was the Qingcheng sect but if it was really dangerous, she would stop activities for a while and hide in the shadows.Haomun has always lived like that, and will continue to do so.Cheongyeop looked at Oh San-kyung for a moment and then came out. Outside, Cheongsan and his disciples were waiting for him. Cheongsan approached Cheongyeop and asked,\u00a0\u201cWere there any leads?\u201d\u201cThere are people who can be considered suspicious. So I think it would be better to investigate from there.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d\u201cThere is a person named Pyo-wol. He is the most notable person who has recently entered Chengdu.\u201d\u201cPyo-wol? I see.\u201dWhen Cheongsan mentioned Pyo-wol, all of a sudden,\u201cSenior brother!\u201dSuddenly, one of the great disciples came running to them.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cThe Emei sect\u2019s movements are unusual.\u201d\u201cUnusual? What do you mean?\u201d\u201cAccording to the message of the Golden Gates, the atmosphere in the White Flower Room where the Emei sect\u2019s disciples are staying in is very intense.\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know that far, but it is said that it is unusual for the Emei sect and the White Flower Room to move around.\u201d\u201cEmei\u2026\u201dCheongyeop frowned.Golden Gate\u2019s sect leader Yeo Sanwi was a very careful person. If he sent someone to warn him like that, it meant that the atmosphere was really bad.\u201cLet\u2019s go back to the Golden Gate.\u201d\u201cThen what about the task of tracking the assassin?\u201d\u201cThis comes first. It\u2019s never too late to find the asssassin later.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dCheongsan answered with a strong voice. Cheongyeop and Cheongsan led their disciples back to Golden Gate.* * *\u201cIt\u2019s finally quiet.\u201dAs the voices of Cheongyeop and others heard from outside disappeared, Oh San-kyung muttered with a refreshing expression.Negotiating with a large clan like the Qingcheng sect made her feel exhausted. The size and influence of the Haomun is second to that of the Qingcheng sect.\u00a0However, if the area is not limited to Sichuan, the story is different.The influence and dominance of the Qingcheng and Emei sect within Sichuan fortress is not comparable to any other sect. It was the same with Haomen.Because of that, they were grievous and respectful of each other.It\u2019s about keeping a good relationship to some extent. They knew all too well that crossing the line would only hurt each other.Still, looking at it like this, she couldn\u2019t help but feel tired.\u201cBy the way, who is the real culprit? Is it really him?\u201dOh San-kyung tapped the tip of her chin with her finger. She pulled out a yellow booklet from the bookshelf. On the thick booklet was written the words \u201cChengdu Martial Artist Directory\u201d.In other words, it was a valuable booklet containing the images of the warriors who were active in Chengdu.The Haomen Chengdu branch revised the booklet every ten days.When a new warrior appears, it is recorded in a booklet every ten days. This booklet, updated every ten days, is copied and sent to the main sect once every two months.Not only the Chengdu branch, but all the branches of Haomen send information to the headquarters in this way. Thanks to this, Haomen was able to possess the largest amount of human information in the world.As she flipped through the booklet, she saw the name she wrote most recently.[Name \u2013 Pyo-wol.Identity unknown.Objective unknown.Affiliation unknown.He possesses enough skill to subdue the Black Cloud Mercenary Group\u2019s vice captain in an instant.\u00a0He had very extreme tendencies.\u00a0The place he first appeared was in Red Sky Pavillion in Batang, Western Sichuan Province.With the courtesans of Red Sky Pavillion\u2026]Inside the booklet, Pyo-wol\u2019s actions after he came into the world were written in detail. It has not been long since Pyo-wol appeared in Chengdu, but Haomun were already aware of his whereabouts.\u201cDid he really kill Nam Ho-san?\u201dOh San-kyung wrinkled the tip of her nose. Pyo-wol was also the subject of careful attention in Haomun.It was because of his unusual appearance, unclear history, and the strong force he showed in the process of subduing the leader and members of the Gujin Pyo-guk.Now, if she can send this booklet to the main office, a judgment will be made there.But one thing could be said for sure.If this booklet were to be read by the main sect, it would no longer be possible for Pyo-wol to enjoy his freedom any longer. Because Haomen will send a master to closely monitor his every move.\u201cWho told him to get caught by our sect\u2019s surveillance network? I don\u2019t know what will happen to him from now on.\u201dIt was time for her to put the booklet back on the bookshelf.\u201cHm, so there was such a thing\u2026\u201dAn emotionless voice was suddenly heard from behind her back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Therefore, if a suspicious person appeared, they were immediately reported to Oh San-kyung. This was the reason how Oh San-kyung and the Chengdu branch managed to escape from numerous threats so far.They were confident that no martial artist could escape Haomun\u2019s strict surveillance system.\u00a0But at this moment, Oh San-kyung\u2019s pride was shattered by the voice from behind her.Oh San-kyung swallowed dry saliva and carefully opened her mouth.\u201cWho\u2014 are you?\u201dShe secretly raised her qi.\u00a0At that moment, a white hand popped out from behind.The white hand held the booklet Oh San-kyung was holding.The booklet contains all the information about numerous warriors that Haomun Chengdu branch has collected so far. To Oh San-kyung, it was more important than her own life.Oh San-kyung turned around and tried to attack the owner of the voice. But strangely, her body stiffened and she couldn\u2019t move.It wasn\u2019t a blood lust nor was she forcibly suppressed. Even so, her body could not move. She was overwhelmed by the atmosphere emanating from her unknown opponent.Oh San-kyung clenched her teeth and tried to move her body, but she remained immobile. Meanwhile, the white hand completely took the booklet from Oh San-kyung\u2019s hand.Pararak!She heard the sound of a book flipping behind her back.That brief moment felt like an eternity to Oh San-kyung.She heard a voice muttering.\u201cIt\u2019s not too long since I\u2019ve entered Chengdu, yet you already did your research.\u201d\u201cI, I am the head of the Haomun Chengdu Branch. Haomen will never stand still if you harm me.\u201d\u00a0\u201cI know. That\u2019s why I came.\u201d\u201cYou came here knowing that? What the hell?\u201d\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want my information to go around without my permission.\u201d\u201cThen?\u201dOh San-kyung rolled her eyes.\u2018So you\u2019re saying that you\u2019re the person who\u2019s name is listed on the Chengdu\u2019s Directory of Martial Artist?\u2019She traced her memory to see if there was such a radical disposition in the list of martial artists. Quite a lot of people came to mind, but she couldn\u2019t easily think of the name of this secretive and creepy warrior.Oh San-kyung suddenly remembered that the person mentioned that he had just entered Chengdu. There was only one such warrior in the Chengdu Military Personnel List.\u201cOh, so you\u2019re Pyo-wolt.\u201d\u201cCorrect.\u201dThe owner of the voice was Pyo-wol. Pyo-wol revealed his identity without hiding it. At that moment, a cold sweat ran down Oh San-kyung\u2019s back.There was only one reason why the warrior, who had sneaked in secretly, was now revealing his identity.\u2018Assassination?\u2019He just has to kill the person who knows his identity so that they don\u2019t talk about it. Oh San-kyung has seen such cases countless times. But she never dreamed that she would one day be the target.\u201cCome on, let\u2019s compromise.\u201d\u201cCompromise?\u201d\u201cI will hide the identity of Mister. The name of Mister will never leak out of my mouth.\u201d\u201cBut you already talked well about me to the disciples of the Qingcheng sect.\u201d\u201cIt was a request.\u201dOh San-kyung realized that Pyo-wol had been watching from beginning to end.\u00a0It was no coincidence that Pyo-wol found the Haomun Chengdu branch.He was monitoring the movements of the Qingcheng sect.Before seeing the list of the martial artists, he must be planning to retreat quietly. However, the moment he saw the contents of the Chengdu\u2019s Directory of Martial Artist, he must have changed his mind.The first page was full of information about himself.If this information goes up to Haomen\u2019s main headquarters, his existence will be revealed to the whole world.At the moment, only an outline was written, but if Haomun made up its mind to follow the complete history of Pyo-wol, the truth about him would soon be revealed.They will know his name someday, but for now he intends to remain anonymous. At least until the end of his revenge against the Qingcheng sect and Emei sect.\u201cWho else have read this booklet?\u201d\u201cNo one but me\u2014 please, spare me.\u201d\u201cIf I let you live, you\u2019ll talk.\u201d\u201cYes. Trust me.\u201dSquirm!At that moment, Oh San-kyung\u2019s finger moved. As a result of steadily raising her internal qi over time, the stiffness of her body was gone.\u201cDie!\u201dOh San-kyung turned around like a thunderbolt and swung her arms.It was Biyeongsu1, a technique of Haomen. It was an attack that could cut down even a large tree at once. Oh San-kyung released the technique with all her might.Even if this single move didn\u2019t take the opponent\u2019s life, she had no doubts that she would at least make him back down. She planned to run out and escape the moment her opponent backed off.Suuu!Her hand cut through the space where Pyo-wol was supposed to be. But there was no sensation on the fingertips. Her hand met an empty space.Ting!At that moment, Oh San-kyung heard the sound of a string bouncing.At first, she didn\u2019t know what that meant.Jurreuk!If she didn\u2019t feel the stinging pain on her neck with something flowing out, she wouldn\u2019t have even known what happened to her.\u00a0Oh San-kyung inadvertently touched her neck with her hand. She touched a moist liquid.\u2018What\u2026 what is this?\u2019Oh San-kyung felt her strength draining out of her body.\u201cKeuk!\u201dSuddenly, a gasp rushed out of her throat. Her neck was split like the gills of a fish. Air was leaking from the cracked area. Oh San-kyung desperately tried to stop the bleeding from the open wound.Fear and doubt were present in both of her eyes.\u2018Uh, when and how?\u2019She had no idea what her opponent did. She hadn\u2019t even seen Pyo-wol yet.\u201cAh, like a demon\u2026\u201dOh San-kyung could not finish her words and collapsed. That was the end of Oh San-kyung. She didn\u2019t even realize how she died until the moment she stopped breathing.Only after Oh San-kyung completely stopped breathing did Pyo-wol appear in the dark. Pyo-wol waved his hand and retracted the Soul-Reaping Thread.Even after killing Oh San-kyung, there was no guilt on Pyo-wol\u2019s face.Pyo-wol put the list of martial artists in his bosom.He searched the residence of Oh San-kyung and confirmed that there were no objects associated with him other than the Chengdu\u2019s Directory of Martial Artist.If the Haomen Headquarters sends someone to investigate the truth, his existence will be revealed. But by then everything will all be over.\u00a0Pyo-wol quietly came out.The Haomun warriors outside had no idea what was going on inside. Pyo-wol evaded their line of sights and escaped from the Haomun Chengdu branch.After a long time after he disappeared, people\u2019s screams echoed in the Haomun Chengdu branch.\u201cBranch manager!\u201d\u201cCome on, call the physician!\u201d* * *Before a major event that would shock people, there was always something called foreshadowing. The little things that went unnoticed at the time were actually a kind of signal that happened before the big event happened.In particular, the stronger the number of incidents, the more such omens appeared.The event that showed the most foreboding within 100 years of Jianghu was the War of the Demons and Heaven.At that time, many people noticed the signs yet they ignored them. As a result, there was a major incident in which former strong martial artists were involved, and that was the War of the Demons and Heaven.Fortunately, an outstanding soldier named Lee Gwak appeared and ended the war, but the incident at that time left a big scar on the hearts of the warriors.Older warriors who remember those days no longer ignore even the smallest incident. They all fear that a small incident may turn into a great battle.There were such martial artists who had the same beliefs in Sichuan.Fosanhae, the sect leader of the Fire Dragon Room2, was such a person.Contrary to his crude appearance, he is very resourceful and has a wide view of reading the flow of events.\u00a0Thanks to this, 15 years after becoming a disciple of the previous sect leader of the Fire Dragon Room, he took over the Fire Dragon Room and established the strongest power among the four rooms.There was a deep trough in Fosanhae\u2019s forehead.\u201cThe young master of the Thunder Gates was assassinated by an assassin who was presumed to have mastered the martial arts of the Qingcheng sect, and now, the atmosphere inside the White Flower Room is bad?It was scorching news that Suha brought a while ago.\u201cI couldn\u2019t figure out what exactly happened inside the White Flower Room. However, the atmosphere inside their sect was really intense. It\u2019s clear that an unusual incident has happened.\u201d\u201cThis is the first time in seven years\u2026\u201dSeven years ago, there was a major incident that shook the entire Sichuan province.In order to subdue the assassin group called the Blood Shadow Group, all the sects in Sichuan were mobilized to unfold the inescapable net. The operation was led by the Qingcheng sect and the Emei sect, so Fosanhae also participated and led the other members of the Fire Dragon Room.It would have been impossible not to participate in the work led by the two leading sects in Sichuan Province. If they hesitated or rejected the invitation to participate with the pursuit, they could become the public enemy of all sects in Sichuan Province.At the time, he participated with a light heart.The Blood Shadow Group was a famous assassin group in Sichuan, but it was impossible for them to escape from the inescapable net in which all the sects of Sichuan participated.The warriors who participated in the inescapable net found and killed assassins as if they were hunting animals. The reason for subjugating the Blood Shadow Group didn\u2019t matter to them.It was more important to them that they could kill assassins, the evil of Jianghu, at will.In a way, it was kind of a joke.After the War of the Demons and Heaven, there was a new order in Jianghu.Existing powerful sects such as Shaolin Temple, Wudang sect, and Mount Hua were firmly established in the Yi River represented by Gwangmumun and Cheonmujang. (\uad11\ubb34\ubb38\uacfc \ucc9c\ubb34\uc7a5\uc73c\ub85c \ub300\ubcc0\ub418\ub294 \uc774\uac15(\u4e8c\u5f3a)\uc5d0 \uc18c\ub9bc\uc0ac\uc640 \ubb34\ub2f9\ud30c, \ud654\uc0b0\ud30c \uac19\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uac15\ud638 \ubb38\ud30c\uac00 \uad73\uac74\ud558\uac8c \uc790\ub9ac\ub97c \uc7a1\uc740 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4.)Unfortunately, there was no such sect in Sichuan.The most likely sects were the Qingcheng sect and Emei sect, but unfortunately, they closed their doors and went into isolation when the War of the Demons and Heaven broke out. Because of this, the newly established sects had no choice but to push them out of their position.The closed topography of Sichuan also played a part.Because Sichuan is a basin surrounded by high mountain ranges, a strong ecosystem of its own has been created. While its topography made it possible to survive without interaction with the outside, its topography also made it difficult to advance and explore the outside areas.\u00a0After the new order of Sichuan was established, there was little chance for each of them to fight. Probably because they are intertwined with each other in many ways.The assassin hunting incident that took place after a boring and peaceful time passed, drove the warriors of Sichuan into excitement. It was because they can hunt assassins without caring for others\u2019 opinions.Although Fosanhae was worried about such an atmosphere, he still participated in the inescapable net.To fall out of the board made by the Emei and Qingcheng sect was no different from saying that they would be ostracized by the martial artists of the entire Sichuan Province.The subjugation of the assassins was successful.The warriors of Sichuan Province found the assassins one by one and brutally killed them.\u00a0They were so sure of a perfect victory without any consequences.But an unexpected incident occurred.One of the assassins had successfully killed Woo Gunsang, a member of the Qingcheng sect.Sichuan was turned upside down.While majority of the assassins chose to escape, a single person defied everyone\u2019s expectations and carried out a solo assassination.The fuming Qingcheng sect sent their disciples to pursue the assassin together with the Emei sect. They chased the assassin to the end and eventually killed him.\u00a0However, he didn\u2019t know what happened, but after that, the relationship between the Emei sect and Qingcheng sect had turned for the worst.In the end, those two sects that represented Sichuan fought and treated each other as enemies. They collided several times and suffered heavy damage.In retrospect, there were a lot of foreshadowings even before the incident at that time.They just didn\u2019t realize it.And now, seven years have passed.Due to the confrontation between the two sects, the sects in Sichuan Province were divided into two sides.The Fire Dragon Room was still neutral, but they couldn\u2019t stay like this forever. Eventually, they had to choose a side. It was a concern.The young master of the Thunder Gates died, and another trouble occurred in the White Flower Room.\u00a0Maybe this is a warning.A warning that will drive the entire Sichuan Province into a sea of blood.Foshanhae stroked his beard with his hand.\u201cThis is not good. It seems that these series of events are all intertwined. Could it be that there is a mastermind that no one knows about?\u201dIt was true that the Emei sect and Qingcheng sect had been fighting for seven years, but the recent events were too sudden.Without giving them time to think, a series of incidents broke out, driving the relationship between the Emei sect and Qingcheng sect to the worst.It almost made me feel like someone was guiding them.\u201cIf there really is such a person\u2014\u201dJust thinking about it gave him goosebumps all over his body. When he was about to continue his reasoning,\u201cSect, sect leader!\u201dAn urgent voice came from outside.With an ominous feeling, Foshanhae jumped up from his seat and opened the door. Then a disciple ran in.Foshanhae asked,\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cThere was a battle between the Qingcheng and Emei sect in Chengdu!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cBecause of that, there is a riot in the center of Chengdu. You should go see it soon.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dFoshanhae grabbed his weapon.He completely forgot all the thoughts he had been thinking about a moment ago.Foshanhae took his disciples and ran to the place where the two sect were fighting.A sticky wind clung to his face as he ran.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And another disciple of the Emei sect also came out for a while.\u00a0They come across each other by chance in the downtown area.The disciple of the Qingcheng sect tried to pass by quietly. This was because it was the Qingcheng sect\u2019s order not to bump into the Emei sect.\u00a0However, the second generation disciple of the Emei sect was different. She received the same order, but her emotions were heightened by Gongseon\u2019s death.The moment she saw the third generation disciple of the Qingcheng sect, her emotions exploded.Her mind was engulfed in anger and so she attacked the third generation disciple of the Qingcheng sect. The third generation disciple did his best to defend himself.However, there was a big gap in the martial arts between a third and a second generation disciple.\u00a0Naturally, the second generation disciple, who had learned the vision of their sect for a longer period of time, was bound to be superior.In the end, the third generation disciple fled to Golden Gate, while the second generation disciple of the Emei sect pursued him to the end and inflicted serious wounds.In response, the angry disciples of the Qingcheng sect then pursued and inflicted serious wounds on the Emei sect disciple as revenge. In the end, the warriors from both sides lost their reason and collided in the middle of Chengdu.Cheongyeop tried to lead the disciples of the Qingcheng sect, but he could not completely stop the movement of those who were angry at the injuries inflicted on the third generation disciple.The bigger problem is that the Golden Gates also got involved into the fight.There was no problem with the participation of Golden Gates, but even those who were friendly with the Golden Gate and the Qingcheng sect jumped in, and the fight spread like wildfire.The Emei sect did not stand still.In the crisis of the second generation disciple, the White Flower Room and the Emei sect joined the fight. Even the Black Cloud Mercenary Group intervened.\u201cShit!\u201dZhang Mu-ryang felt like he was having a nightmare.He and the dozen Black Cloud Mercenary Group, including Yang Woo-jeong and Go Dosa stood at the center of the battlefield in the middle of Chengdu.Until just an hour before, he was working with two men in strategizing how to effectively attack the Qingcheng sect with the least amount of sacrifice.But suddenly he heard the news that the disciples of the Emei sect and Qingcheng sect had collided. And so he rushed towards them to find out the truth.\u00a0But before he could figure out the situation, the fight escalated like crazy. There\u2019s no way to intervene.\u201cKekkeuk!\u201d\u201cDamn it!\u201dStreet stalls and shops were all broken, and wounded warriors were screaming as they collapsed.Still, the fight was not over.The warriors of the Qingcheng sect and the Emei sect were frantically swinging their swords at each other as if they were sworn enemies, while the warriors of the Golden Gate and the warriors of the White Flower Room were fighting each other fiercely.\u201cLet\u2019s defeat the reckless Qingcheng sect!\u201d\u201cEnemies of the Senior Sister Gongseon!\u201d\u201cDie!\u201dThe disciples of the Emei sect attacked the disciples of the Qingcheng sect with their eyes full of malice. The courage of the Qingcheng sect warriors who responded to it was not easy.\u201cHow dare you talk?!\u201d\u201cWho do you think is responsible for all this? Didn\u2019t the Emei sect instigate an assassin to kill Senior Brother Woo?! You really are truly ruthless people!\u201d\u201cPunish the Emei sect!\u201dThe disciples of the Qingcheng sect also swung their swords relentlessly.Both sides had reasons to hate each other.Their hatred exploded like a volcano.Hatred paralyzed reason, and the paralyzed reason erupted into extreme violence.The warriors of both factions were showing how cruel martial artists can be if they are blinded by anger.\u201cKUGH!\u201d\u201cGEUH!\u201dScreams broke out incessantly, and the streets of Chengdu were stained with blood.It was the warriors of the Qingcheng sect and the Golden Gates who won the fight. The warriors of the Emei sect and the White Flower Room did their best, but they were inferior in terms of power.Zhang Mu-ryang, who understood the situation, told the members of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group, who was with him.\u201cIt can\u2019t be like this. Assemble all the Black Cloud Troops.\u201d\u201cDo you mean everyone?\u201d\u201cYes. If we don\u2019t try to overturn this fight, we won\u2019t even get a chance to win.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dAfter answering, the warriors of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group hurriedly ran to their residence.\u201cLet\u2019s go and join the war, Go Dosa! We have to push the Qingcheng sect!\u201d\u201cYes, Captain!\u201d\u201cVice Captain Yang would lead the rest of the members to the left and attack the flank of the Qingcheng sect. If they cut them off from the back, the power of the Qingcheng sect will deteriorate.\u201d\u201cBut it won\u2019t last long.\u201d\u201cWe just have to hold on until the other members come. If even a few cavalry join in, we can reverse this situation in one go.\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201dYang Woo-jeong followed Zhang Mu-ryang. Only a small portion of the horsemen that the Black Cloud Mercenary group were proud of had entered Chengdu. The rest were waiting outside Chengdu.When the mercenaries on horseback entered, it attracted a lot of people\u2019s attention. But Zhang Mu-ryang immediately regretted his actions. He had no idea that the situation would deteriorate so quickly.\u201cEveryone, stop fighting!\u201dThe sect leader of the Fire Dragons Room, Fosanhae, arrived on the battlefield late and shouted. He tried to mediate with all his might, but he couldn\u2019t convince the soldiers on both sides who had madness in their eyes.Suic!\u201cKeuk!\u201dOn the contrary, even he was wounded by a sword shot by a nearby warrior. The wound itself was light, but the soldiers under his command who saw him were the problem.\u201cHow dare you attack the sect leader!\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t forgive you!\u201dThe soldiers of the Fire Dragon Room attacked the soldiers of the White Flower Room..\u201cNo!\u201dThe Foshanhae tried to stop them but to no avail. The soldiers killed, defended, and fought back until the situation was at its worst. Numerous goods were broken, and many shops collapsed.Spectators watching the fight screamed and fled, while some even took advantage of the chaos to loot nearby shops. They didn\u2019t just steal things, they even killed the merchants who tried to stop them by setting them on fire.The fire spread to a nearby shop, and people fetched water to put out the fire. However, there was a limit to extinguishing a fire with a bucket.\u201cAigoo! What should we do?!\u201d\u201cHelp! Our store is on fire!\u201dThe shopkeepers turned to the Qingcheng sect and Emei sect for help. However, the merchants\u2019 screams could not be heard in the ears of the warriors who had been fiercely fighting for a long time.It was as if hell had opened up.The warriors became demons and ran wild, while the bystanders revealed their true and evil natures.Jjoeng!\u201cEum!\u201dZhang Mu-ryang groaned. They only collided once, but he felt quite a shock.\u00a0His opponent was Cheongsan, a disciple of the Qingcheng sect. Contrary to his gentle face, Cheongsan was a swordsman with terrifying skills.\u00a0He pressed Zhang Mu-ryang with his swift movements like a leopard. Cheongsan was so swift that Zhang Mu-ryang could not keep up with him.Because of that, he fought without taking a break. Zhang Mu-ryang clenched his teeth and looked around.Yang Woo-jeong and Go Dosa were also fighting against the members of the Qingchengs ect, but still, the Emei sect and the White Flower Room were being pushed back.\u2018Why haven\u2019t they come yet?\u2019He remembered the warriors he sent to his residence. By now, they should have brought the rest of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group that were in their residence.\u2018What the hell is going on?\u2019* * *Drip!Drops of blood wet the earth.Jo Jeoksan, a mercenary of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group, stared blankly at the blood flowing from his body.The red blood that started from his neck and ran down his shoulders and arms felt as if it belonged to someone else. But the blood that fell to the ground was definitely his.\u201cKeeuc!\u201dJo Jeoksan groaned and grabbed his neck. He felt the cold touch of metal on the tip of his finger. It didn\u2019t take long to notice that it was the dagger\u2019s handle.\u201cYou, you?\u201dJo Jeoksan looked at the owner of the dagger.A dark figure suddenly appeared on the road and suddenly attacked him as he was on his way to call his colleagues.\u00a0It was Pyo-wol. And the dagger stuck in the neck of Jo Jeoksan was the ghost knife.\u201cYou\u2019re cowardly and shameless\u2026 Khyuk!\u201dJo Jeoksan choked out blood from his mouth. His face was full of grievances. It was impossible for any physician to come and save him. Jo Jeoksan sensed his death.As a member of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group, he wandered through many battlefields. Death was always near, and he thought that one day he would die too. But he didn\u2019t know it would come so suddenly.He never dreamed that a person who he didn\u2019t even know would kill him. He was going to die without even knowing why.\u00a0\u2018I have to bring the Black Cloud Troops to Captain\u2013\u201dEven in his clouded mind, he considered it a shame that he could not carry out Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s orders. Jo Jeoksan\u2019s body shook violently and collapsed helplessly.Pyo-wol looked down at the dead Jo Jeoksan for a while and retrieved the ghost knife using the Soul-Reaping Thread. He had no personal grudge against Jo Jeoksan.\u00a0Still, the reason he secretly attacked and killed Jo Jeoksan was because when he was about to summoned the rest of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group. He couldn\u2019t allow that to happen or else the board he had worked so hard would be messed up.The Qingcheng sect and the Emei sect had to fight for as long as possible. Only then will they inflict fatal damage to each other.\u00a0If the Black Cloud Corps intervened, the situation could have ended prematurely. That\u2019s why Pyo-wol killed Jo Jeoksan whom Zhang Mu-ryang asked to ask for support.As long as Jo Jeoksan is dead, the support that Zhang Mu-ryang has so longed for will not come. Even if they come, it will be too late.Pyo-wol headed to the center of Chengdu, where the fight was taking place for quite some time.\u00a0The closer he got to the center, the more intense the scent of blood was scattered along with smoke. So many people were lying on the floor either dead or injured.It was like a scene from hell.No one would have expected that such a tragic scene would unfold in the middle of the city.Chengdu was the central city of Sichuan, and it was the place where many cultural artifacts and objects were gathered.Naturally, the security was unparalleled in comparison to other cities, and even the clans of strong families were extremely reluctant to wield their swords here.Therefore, the perception that it is the safest place in Sichuan Province was implicitly ingrained in people\u2019s minds. But at this moment, people\u2019s perceptions were shattered and broken like glass.Chengdu was not a safe place.The fierce battle between the Qingcheng sect and Emei sect clearly planted the emotion of fear in people\u2019s minds.Pyo-wol looked around for a moment, then jumped up onto a tall tree standing on one side of the road. From the top of the tree, the view of the whole area could be seen at a glance. Pyo-wol sat down on a thin branch and watched the fight unfolding below.Among them, there were some that stood out.\u201cHow dare you send an assassin to kill my disciple?! How can the Qingcheng sect claim to be a part of Jianghu?\u201dJeonghwa stared at Cheongyeop, who had a wound on his left arm, with killing intent.\u00a0She only had one eye left and yet her eyes were still full of malice.Cheongyeop raised his sword with a calm expression.\u201cIt was you who touched the Qingcheng sect first. You were the one who instigated Gunsang\u2019s assassination, and it must have been you who brought about the death of the young master of the Thunder Gates.\u201d\u201cWhat bullshit are you talking about? We never told someone to assassinate the young master of the Thunder Gates.\u201d\u201cYou said the same thing seven years ago. What was the result? It turned out to be your fault in the end.\u201dJeonghwa bit her lips. They had no excuse for requesting the Bloody Shadow Group to assassinate Woo Gunsang. But she couldn\u2019t just admit it in front of everyone.If that happens, it will be a confirmation of the immorality of the Emei sect to everyone.Jeonghwa became determined and raised her voice.\u201cDon\u2019t be silly! Why would we assassinate the young master of the Thunder Gates? I heard that the assassin used a sword technique of the Qingcheng sect, how would you explain that? You assassinated him because the Thunder Gates\u2019s young master was about to be betrothed to a member of the White Flower Room. How can the disciples of the Qingcheng sect have so little conscience?\u201dCheongyeop frowned.Because he cannot deny those words.It was true that the assassin who killed the young master of the Thunder Gates used Qingcheng sect\u2019s martial arts, so it was difficult to make excuses.Cheongyeop suddenly felt a strange feeling. It was because of the one word that kept coming up in his and Jeonghwa\u2019s conversations.\u2018Assassin.\u2019An assassin killed the young master of the Thunder Gates. And it\u2019s also an assassin who killed the disciple of Jeonghwa. What the two cases have in common is that the identity of the assassin has not been revealed.\u2018Maybe there is only one assassin.\u2019However, Cheong-yeop could not continue his thoughts. Because Jeonghwa has attacked.\u201cNo, wait!\u201d\u201cOne of us will have to be buried here today.\u201dJeonghwa attacked, wielding her chowry. She used the weapon to unleash the Emei sect swordsmanship, the Broken Jade Sword.1The Broken Jade Sword was strong enough to prevent Cheongyeop from having other thoughts.In order to face the attack, Cheongyeop also had to use the Qingcheng sect\u2019s technique.\u00a0There was no room for him to have a leisurely conversation.Tuhwahak!In front of the chowry\u2019s formidable offensive attack, Cheongyeop unfolded the Qingcheng\u2019s attack, Blue Cloud Drop Sword.2As the chowry and sword collided, the air around the area shook violently.Pyo-wol watched all the sights from the tree.All the warriors were dancing on the board he laid out.Hoped everyone enjoyed the chapter~ Don\u2019t forget to comment down below what you think of the chapter <3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 69": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 69Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201dYong Seol-ran\u2019s eyes trembled violently.An unbelievable tragedy was happening right before her eyes.The disciples of the Emei sect and the White Flower Room were lying on the floor and bleeding.\u00a0Of course, the disciples of the Qingcheng sect and Golden Gates had fallen as much as they did, but they did not enter the eyes of Yong Seol-ran.\u201cGonghwa!\u201dYong Seol-ran\u2019s eyes saw a female disciple of the same age as her. It was Gonghwa, a second generation disciple of the Emei sect.Although they did not speak much to each other, they were still of the same age, so they used to talk comfortably when they met. So their relationship was a bit special.Gonghwa was twitching and lying on her own blood. Yong Seol-ran rushed towards Gonghwa.\u201cWho did this to you?\u201d\u201cChaat!\u201dThe warriors of the Golden Gate who saw her immediately attacked her. Yong Seol-ran held Gonghwa with one hand and spread out her other palm.\u00a0Kwaaaa!In an instant, a strong pressure emanated from her hand and struck the warriors of the Golden Gate.\u201cKukhyuk!\u201d\u201cGuergh!\u201dThe warriors of Golden Gate collapsed to the floor and were unable to move. It was Pyoseol Cheonunjang, which proudly has its name on the top of the Emei sect\u2019s martial arts.Pyoseol Cheonunjang was a technique that was not usually used unless it was either urgent or a life-and-death situation, and the current situation was as such so Yong Seol-ran unleashed her technique.Its power was truly astonishing, and even within the Golden Gate, the high rank warriors became unable to resist.However, Yong Seol-ran did not even look at the opponent she had defeated and looked at Gonghwa in her arms.\u201cAre you okay, senior sister?\u201d\u201cJunio\u2026 sister?\u201d\u201cYes! It\u2019s me. Come on, get up, I\u2019ll help you.\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d\u00a0Yong Seol-ran struggled to understand what Gonghwa was trying to say. But even that slight movement disappeared after a while. She stopped breathing.\u201cNo!\u201dA look of disbelief appeared on Yong Seol-ran\u2019s face.She wanted this whole situation to be a lie.The situation itself felt unrealistic. Until yesterday, the disciples were leisurely having a meal together and talking, but now they\u2019re all falling down with their blood pouring everywhere.\u00a0Yong Seol-ran was one of the few who knew the truth about why the Emei sect and the Qingcheng sect hate each other so much.First of all, knowing that the Emei sect had made a mistake, they had no choice but to be passive in the fight against the Qingcheng sect.It was the Emei sect who requested the Blood Shadow Group for an assassination, and it was also them who betrayed the said assassin group.Knowing that the root cause of all these events was provided by the Emei sect, she was unable to go to the forefront of the war against the Qingcheng sect.\u00a0Her conscience didn\u2019t allow it.But now she realized.No matter what she felt, a war still broke out, and because of her hesitation, the Emei sect disciples were now dying.\u201cI don\u2019t know how the situation came to be, but it is unacceptable for any of the Emei sect\u2019s disciples to die in front of my eyes.\u201dYong Seol-ran flew towards the disciples of the Cheongseongpa.\u201cHa!\u201dIn her hand, a snow-covered celestial cloud was spread out.Kwaaa!The intense pressure swept the Qingcheng sect disciples like a storm.\u201cKukhyuk!\u201d\u201cKurgh!\u201dWhen Yong Seol-ran intervened, the situation escalated even more.Not only the Qingcheng sect and the Emei sect, but also the disciples of the Golden Gate, White Flower Room, and Fire Dragon Room attacked each other.Their reason flew away. Only madness remained, controlling their instincts.Whenever a warrior saw their colleagues right next to them die, they would lose their sanity and rush towards the enemy without thinking. This happened frequently and because of that, deaths and damages multiplied like a snowball in an instant.\u201cWhat? Why isn\u2019t the Black Cloud Mercenary Group coming?\u201dZhang Mu-ryang looked around the battlefield with a puzzled expression.The Black Cloud Mercenary Group should have arrived by now and participated in the battle. However, the Jo Jeoksan, who was sent to summon the Black Cloud Mercenary Group, hasn\u2019t come back.Zhang Mu-ryang felt something strange.\u201cMaybe the Qingcheng sect? No! They can\u2019t afford to be distracted.\u201dHe could tell just by looking at the facial expressions of the Qingcheng sect\u2019s disciples fighting here. They had no leeway to slack off.Zhang Mu-ryang thought that this whole situation was deliberately created.\u00a0It was as if someone was in control of the whole situation.\u201cSeol-pyo!\u201dZhang Mu-ryang called for an aide who was nearby.\u201cYes, Captain!\u201dSeol-pyo came to him, covered in blood. Some of it was his own blood but most of it was the blood of others.\u201cThe flow of the battle is strange. The cumulative total has not returned yet, and everything is arbitrary.\u201d\u201cI think so too. Things are moving too quickly.\u201d\u201cYou get out quietly and look around.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cI feel like someone is manipulating this fight in the background. Find out if there\u2019s really someone like that.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dSeol-pyo stepped back without saying a word. Because he also felt the same way as Zhang Mu-ryang.Seol-pyo quietly exited the battlefield.In the meantime, he was attacked several times, but he did not counterattack and just evaded. In return, he suffered minor injuries. But he ignored the wounds. He had received wounds like this countless times.He looked at the battlefield from the outside, there was no hell like this.\u00a0It had been a long time since he had seen a battlefield dominated by this level of madness. It was by no means easy for the elite disciples of the Emei or Qingcheng sect to be eroded by madness.\u2018It is clear that someone is controlling the situation just as the Captain suspected.\u2019Seol-pyo looked around.Suddenly, his gaze turned to the highest place in the area.It was a large tree nestled not far from the street where the fight was taking place. If someone is up there, they will be able to see the whole scene clearly.He thought that if there was someone who really instigated this situation, they must be on that tree. Securing a line of sight would be the most important thing in controlling a battlefield.Without hesitation, Seol-pyo flew towards the large tree. His body pierced the lush branches and landed lightly on a large trunk.Pit!At that moment, he felt a strong sense of danger. As he looked up, he saw a dagger falling down at the top of his head.\u201cSo you were here, you bastard!\u201dHe twisted his body to dodge the dagger and shouted.He was shouting in hopes that Zhang Mu-ryang could hear him, but unfortunately his voice did not reach Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s ears.Seol-pyo reluctantly decided to catch the mastermind himself.Seol-pyo was proud of his martial arts skill. In fact, even within the Black Cloud Mercenary Group, he was ranked among the top 30.Although he cannot be compared to old warriors with strong personalities like Go Dosa and Hyeol Seung, he was still among the strongest among the young warriors.Seol-pyo believed in his own strength.\u201cwait.\u201dHe flew in the direction the dagger was flying.The leaves and branches were so thick that the figure of the attacker was not visible. That\u2019s why he trusted his senses and threw himself away.That was then.Ciit!A dagger came flying again. Seol-pyo tried to avoid this time as well. He avoided it a while ago, so he thought it would be easy to dodge this time as well.\u201cHuh?\u201dBut he soon had a puzzled expression on his face. This was because the dagger\u2019s trajectory had changed in the air. The dagger changed direction abruptly, like a living creature, and flew towards his side.\u201cShit!\u201dKang!Seol-pyo swung his sword with all his might. Fortunately, the dagger was blocked by his sword.Seol-pyo once again kicked off a branch and tried to fly away. But at that moment, the dagger that seemed to have lost its strength and fell to the floor, once again flew again at a terrifying speed.\u201cW, What?\u201dSeol-pyo freaked out. This was something that he could not grasp with his common sense.\u2018Is that really a dagger?\u2019\u2019A flash of fear flashed across his face. If his opponent is really good enough to use swordsmanship, he cannot dare to face him.\u201cShit!\u201dTerrified, he tried to jump off the tree.Kang!But this time, his path was blocked by a dagger that flew and followed himt.Sususu!The dagger flew up and down like a living creature and attacked the Seol-pyo. Seol-pyo tried to shake off the dagger and run away, but to no avail.\u00a0He thought of his situation as a moth caught in a spider\u2019s web.Indeed he was.The dagger gradually tightened around him.He ran out of breathAn extreme fear reigned in his mind.He was already cornered like this, but the fact that he never once saw the face of his opponent made him even more afraid.Puuc!A dagger pierced his shoulder.\u00a0 Seol-pyo opened his mouth in excruciating pain. At that moment, an invisible noose was placed over his head.It was a thread made of qi. The Soul-Reaping Thread was tightened around Seol-pyo\u2019s neck.\u201cKuhk!\u201dSeol-pyo grabbed his neck and struggled. Then his body was suddenly raised on top of the tree.Pyo-wol pulled the thread made out of qi.\u00a0The thread dug into Seol-pyo\u2019s throat. From a distance, Seol-pyo could finally see the face of the man killed him.A man with a handsome face that would make a person dizzy if they would dare look at him. However, in Seol-pyo\u2019s eyes, what was reflected as the god of death.\u201cYou, you?\u201dSueuk!At that moment, the Soul-Reaping Thread pierced Seol-pyo\u2019s neck and completely stopped his breathing.Pyo-wol looked at Seol-pyo\u2019s face for a moment, and then withdrew the qi thread. Then, Seol-pyo\u2019s body fell down a tree, and crashed on a large branch.\u00a0Such a terrible thing happened on top of the big tree, but the people nearby didn\u2019t notice it at all. The large tree continued to sway carelessly in the wind as if nothing had happened.Pyo-wol recovered the dagger that had fallen to the floor by wielding the Soul-Reaping Thread. The compatibility between the ghost knife and the qi thread was absolutely perfect.In particular, it exerted its absolute power in trees or forests with such thick leaves.Right now, he can only use one qi thread and one knife, but in the future, he will be able to freely handle ten knives and ten threads.That was then.Kwang!A huge explosion suddenly erupted from the battlefield.The entire street was destroyed as if a bomb had been dropped. A wind wave like storm hit the tree where Pyo-wol was hiding.Kwarr!The beautiful tree shook precariously as if it were about to break. As a result, the body of the Seol-pyo, which had been hanging from a large branch, fell to the floor.Pyo-wol shook his head and looked at the source of the explosion.There were two people there, a man and a woman.\u00a0It was Cheongyeop and Jeonghwa.There was a huge pit in between Cheongyeop and Jeonghwa. A huge pit was created as a result of the clash of the two people\u2019s desperate efforts.\u201cKeuck!\u201d\u201cKuhruck!\u201dBoth of their conditions were not very good. Cheongyeop\u2019s complexion was pale and blood was dripping from his mouth and nose.Jeonghwa\u2019s condition was even worse. She was on one knee, vomiting blood. She had deep internal injuries.Cheongyeop overpowered Jeonghwa by a small margin. However, the condition of Cheongyeop was also not very good, so it was close to the concept of Yangpae.\u201cJeonghwa!\u201dYong Seol-ran threw away the relentless pursuit of Cheongsan and ran to Jeonghwa.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cGeurgh!\u201dJeonghwa couldn\u2019t give a proper answer for a minute, and only groaned. Her eyes lost their focus. Her consciousness was gradually slipping away.Yong Seol-ran rushed around Jeonghwa and shouted.\u201cEveryone go back to the White Flower Room!\u201dAt her command, the disciples of the Emei sect and White Flower Room picked up the wounded and the dead and retreated.\u00a0\u201cSenior Brother!\u201dCheongsan ran to Cheongyeop.Cheongyeop couldn\u2019t open his mouth. If he forces himself to open his mouth now, his internal wounds will only worsen.It seemed to him that, even at any moment, he spurred on the momentum and firmly subdued the Emei sectand loaded it. However, the damage to the Qingcheng sect and Golden Gate was so great that it was impossible to do so.Cheongsan, who understood the meaning of Cheongyeop with only his eyes, gave the order instead.\u201cWe are backing down too.\u201dThe disciples of Qingcheng sect and Golden Gates also retreated, while carrying the casualties.\u00a0Fosanhae and the rest of the Fire Dragon Room members were coincidentally on the side of the Qingcheng sect. Fosanhae could see the eyes of the Emei disciples staring at him. He wanted to make an excuse and say it was just a misunderstanding, but he knew best that it was useless.No matter what anyone says, the Fire Dragon Room is now being treated as someone on the same side of the Qingcheng sect. He now had turned a huge sect called Emei as his enemy.\u2018Oh Heavens\u2026\u2019He resented the sky for his situation.\u00a0But he didn\u2019t know.It wasn\u2019t the heavens that made him suffer like this, but rather it was because of a man.\u00a0And that man is still watching the entire situation from a tall tree.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 70": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 70Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayRumors that the Qingcheng sect and the Emei sect had clashed in Chengdu spread like wildfire throughout Sichuan Province.The fight between the two sects left a great destruction and many victims behind. So many people have died that it was actually difficult to accurately count the casualties.Among the dead were not only the martial artists from both sides, but also civilians who were unfairly involved in the fight.Because of this, many people criticized and denounced the carelessness of the Qingcheng sect and the Emei sect.\u00a0But no one from the public dared to come forward and speak their inner thoughts. Because they were afraid of retaliation from the two sects.Nevertheless, if it\u2019s just a group of two or more people, they talked about the incident of the two sects. Thus, dissatisfaction about the two sects continues to accumulate.Now, the sects of Chengdu had to make a choice.Qingcheng or Emei. One of the two sects.They can no longer stay neutral.The sects who have maintained a neutral ground for the longest time began to have deep concerns.\u00a0There was great tension in the residence of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group, who stood on the side of the Emei sect and fought against the Qingcheng sect.Bang!When Zhang Mu-ryang struck his fist, the thick table made of rosewood shattered.Two bodies were laid in front of him.It was the body of Jo Jeoksan and Seol-pyo.The place where Jo Jeoksan was discovered was in an alleyway not far from the battlefield, while the body of Seol-pyo was found under a large tree nearby.\u201cWho killed them?\u201dZhang Mu-ryang\u2019s eyes were full of deep anger.It was the same with others. Everyone was looking at the corpse with eyes mixed with anger.Go Dosa inspected the body on behalf of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group.\u201cThey\u2019ve all been killed by the same man.\u201d\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\u201cLook at the wound on Jeoksan\u2019s neck and the wound on Seol-pyo\u2019s shoulder, it\u2019s the same type of cut. Judging by the shape and size of the cut, it\u2019s highly likely to be a dagger or a knife.\u201d\u201cA dagger?\u201d\u201cAlthough there are sharper cuts on the neck, all common wounds appear to have been caused by short-bladed weapons like daggers.\u201dAt the explanation of Go Dosa, Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s expression became more and more distorted.He asked Yang Woo-jeong.\u201cWhat about Oh Yuk-pyo? Didn\u2019t you say that Oh Yuk-pyo\u2019s wounds were also caused by a dagger?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cBring Oh Yuk-pyo quickly. Let\u2019s compare their wounds.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dAfter a while, the warriors, who received the orders of Zhang Mu-ryang, came out with Oh Yuk-pyo on a stretcher.\u201cWhy did you call for me, Captain?\u201dOh Yuk-pyo who was suddenly called out did not know why he was summoned.\u201cLet me inspect your wound.\u201dZhang Mu-ryang tore off Oh Yuk-pyo\u2019s clothes and examined his wounds.\u201cHm!\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the same.\u201d\u201cSame what? What do you mean?\u201dOh Yuk-pyo raised his voice at Zhang Mu-ryang, who did not explain the reason.\u201cThe wounds you have are exactly the same as those guys.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201dOnly then did Oh Yuk-pyo realize that Jo Jeoksan and Seol-pyo had returned as corpses with their bodies chilled. He also realized that the wounds on their bodies and his own were surprisingly consistent with each other.\u201cOh, so does that mean that the guy who injured me was also the one who killed them?\u201dOh Yuk-pyo\u2019s shoulders trembled. Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s gaze turned to Heo Ran-ju.\u201cWhere is he?\u201d\u201cHe is still in the guest house\u2026 Did he really kill them?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you see the wounds? He\u2019s definitely the one who killed these two.\u201dShe had no doubts as she had also seen Pyo-wol use a dagger.\u201cBut why would he?\u201d\u201cFrom now on, we will find out why. He must have been keeping an eye on us for a long time, or maybe he approached us intentionally from the beginning.\u201dIf Pyo-wol had not killed Jo Jeoksan, the Black Cloud Mercenary Group would have helped the Emei sect and consequently overwhelmed the Qingcheng sect. But because Pyo-wol interfered, the great disciple of Emei, Jeonghwa, suffered severe injuries, while the rest of the members also suffered enormous damage.For the Black Cloud Mercenary Group, it was a sudden blow. Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s gaze turned to Heo Ran-ju.\u201cRanju!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cTake all of your subordinates and bring him here. It\u2019s okay to injure him, but bring him back with you alive. I\u2019ll interrogate him myself.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dHeo Ran-ju nodded her head.Whatever his reason was for doing such things, Pyo-wol caused a lot of damage to the Black Cloud Mercenary Group. For the sake of discipline and the future of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group they had to catch and punish Pyo-wol.No matter how free-spirited Heo Ran-ju was, and even though she sometimes argues with Zhang Mu-ryang, she took pride in being a member of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group in the depths of her heart.Heo Ran-ju\u00a0 looked at Hyeol Seung and Go Dosa.They nodded and followed Heo Ran-ju. Twenty more Black Cloud mercenaries followed behind them.* * *The White Flower Room had a gloomy atmosphere.This was because they were pushed back in the fight against the Qingcheng sect and Jeonghwa, one of the great disciples of Emei, was seriously injured.Jeonghwa suffered a deep internal injury and was unable to move.It was the first time she had suffered such a serious injury ever since she lost her eye seven years ago. It was very unfortunate that she lost her eye, but her life back then was not in danger.\u00a0But her wounds now were different. She was in such a serious condition that she could easily lose her life if her injuries worsened.For that reason, a well-known physician from Chengdu came into the White Flower Room and took care of Jeonghwa.The Emei warriors who lost their heads suddenly were in a state of confusion.Geum Ha-ryeon, the sect leader of the White Flower Room, tried to rectify the situation, but the atmosphere and morale of the disciples remained low.While Geum Ha-ryeon had the ability to lead the White Flower Room, it was a different matter for her to try and lead the Emei sect.\u201cHow should I\u2026\u201dGeum Ha-ryun lost her soul at the massive casualties that filled the White Flower Room.She had no idea how to fix this situation.It was the same with Seolha. As Jeonghwa\u2019s nephew, she was friendly with the Emei sect\u2019s disciples, but asking her to lead them was an entirely different matter.\u00a0Yong Seol-ran suddenly came out.\u201cEveryone calm down.\u201dYong Seol-ran was the one with the highest position except for Jeonghwa.\u00a0Until now, she had been reluctant to lead and stay at the frontlines because of Jeonghwa, but the sudden change of circumstances pushed her forward.Yong Seol-ran looked at Geum Ha-ryeon.\u201cCheck the defense of the White Flower Room. The Qingcheng sect might attack again.\u201d\u201cTheir side also suffered a lot of damage, so why will they do that?\u201d\u201cThey might aim for our moment of weakness. Anyway, everyone who can still stand on their own two legs should keep their guard up. We just have to hold on until the support comes from the main sect.\u201d\u201cAre you going to ask the headquarters for support?\u201d\u201cSince Senior Sister Jeonghwa has lost, we need to report it to Master and ask for support.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good if that\u2019s the case.\u201dGeum Ha-ryeon breathed a sigh of relief.Numerous disciples have already died or were injured. If support comes from Emei sect\u2019s headquarters, it will prevent more victims from appearing.Yong Seol-ran\u2019s gaze turned to one of the great disciples.\u201cGongha!\u201d\u201cYes, Junior Sister!\u201d\u201cSend a carrier pigeon to the headquarters right now. Tell them exactly what happened here and ask for their support.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dGongha answered and went out. Yong Seol-ran\u2019s gaze was then directed to Seolha.\u201cHow\u2019s your Senior Sister?\u201d\u201cNot\u2026 good.\u201dSeolha answered weakly. Her biggest supporter was Jeonghwa, not Geum Ha-ryeon, her master. Jeonghwa\u2019s serious injuries took away her confidence.Yong Seol-ran looked at Seolha for a moment, then opened her mouth.\u201cWe need to clearly understand the situation.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean? The fight with the Qingcheng sect just happened by accident.\u201d\u201cOf course, if we just looked at the results. But if you look at the process leading up to the results, there are some things that are not quite clear. Junior Sister Gongseon and the Young Master of the Thunder Gates. The death of those two happened around the same time. Because of this, the relationship between our sect and the Qingcheng sect just grew worse.\u201d\u201cDo you think the two cases are related?\u201d\u201cFor now, we have to be suspicious of everything.\u201dYong Seol-ran was adamant.After leaving Mount Emei and entering Chengdu, she had an ominous premonition but she couldn\u2019t tell why. She shrugged it off at first thinking that she was being too sensitive.\u00a0However, after being away from the Emei sect for the past few days and looking at the overall situation, she felt that the flow of events was not natural.She couldn\u2019t say anything back then because Jeonghwa was keeping her in check, but now the situation has changed. Now that Jeonghwa was unable to move, only she had the right to lead the Emei sect.\u2018We have to figure out the mastermind behind this. Someone is intentionally instigating the fight between the Emei sect and the Qingcheng sect\u2026\u201d* * *\u201cHuh! Huh!\u201dJeonghwa breathed heavily.Although she improved a lot with the help of the physician, her condition was still at risk.To defend the last desperate attack Cheongsan made, she forcefully sent her qi into overdrive which resulted in her bleeding from all points of her body and suffering from a deep internal injury.\u00a0She will need to go back to their main sect and nurture herself for at least a year before she can even begin to recover to a certain extent.\u2018Cheong\u2026san\u2026 I\u2019ll come and kill you.\u2019Even with her horrible condition, Jeonghwa was burning with anger towards the Qingcheng sect.If she could move her body even a little, she would have rushed to the Golden Gates and slaughtered all of the disciples of the Qingcheng sect.Jurreuk!Tears flowed from Jeonghwa\u2019s one and only eye. Her heart is still full of fighting spirit, her body cannot keep up.\u2018If I stay like this, I will lose my position to Seol-ran.\u2019For the first time today, she realized why she was so upset that she couldn\u2019t move her body.Then the physician who was watching her said:\u201cWe must remove the deepening. If the deepening continues, the qi and blood that we worked hard to stabilize will shake again.\u201dA bewildered expression appeared on the physician\u2019s face.Jeonghwa\u2019s pale face suddenly turned bright red. The anger in her heart made her blood boil. Jeonghwa turned her head hard and glared at the physician.\u00a0The physician flinched.Because Jeonghwa\u2019s gaze was so frightening. Her one and only eye was bloodshot, and full of malice. Even when she was beaten up, her eyes did not bend at all.She struggled to open her mouth.\u201cKkeh\u2026\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dWhen the physician couldn\u2019t hear her words, he brought his ears closer to her mouth.\u201cKeuk\u2026 Go. Before I cut your th\u2013\u201d\u201cHiik!\u201dThe physician was startled by Jeonghwa\u2019s venomous words and ran outside. He didn\u2019t go outside because of his own will, but he found the human being called Jeonghwa so scary.As the physician closed the door and left, Jeonghwa closed her eyes.She felt like she could rest comfortably now.She\u00a0 didn\u2019t want to show anyone her vulnerable appearance like this. She thought that it would be better to commit suicide than to show such a shameful appearance.That was then.Srreuk!The door opened quietly.Jeonghwa raised her one and only eye. Her eyes were full of anger.\u201cI told you that I\u2026 will definitely cut you off\u2013\u201dShe turned her head and looked at the door.\u00a0Jeonghwa\u2019s eyes trembled.Because a stranger came in, and not the physician.This was definitely the first time she saw him. But the stranger oddly didn\u2019t feel unfamiliar.His eyes had a soft red tint, and his appearance was non-human-like. But nonetheless, he had an aura that seemed to attract people.The moment she saw him, she felt the hairs all over her body stand straight.Jeonghwa\u2019s eyes widened at the creepy feeling she felt. It felt like her back was being scraped downwards by the tip of a knife.\u00a0Tak!He quietly closed the door.\u201cWho the hell\u2026 are you?\u201dJeonghwa struggled to open her mouth.The man looked at Jeonghwa without saying a word. His reddish eyes seemed to stab Jeonghwa like a dagger. Jeonghwa narrowed her eyes and continued.\u201cKuh-heuk! I asked who\u2013\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t seem to remember.\u201d\u201cDo you know me?\u201d\u201cOf course. I haven\u2019t forgotten your face for a single day nor a single moment in seven years.\u201dThe man\u2019s words were very quiet. However, the content contained within his words were ambiguous.\u201cSeven years?\u201d\u201cYes. Don\u2019t you remember? Seven years ago.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, you don\u2019t seem to recall. Do I have to blind your remaining eye for you to remember?\u201dFor a moment, Jeonghwa trembled as if she had been struck by lightning.\u201cYou\u2026! Are you that assassin?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time.\u201dThe man, Pyo-wol, laughed.The moment Jeonghwa saw his white smile in the dark, she felt a terrible pain in her eye that was covered with an eyepatch.\u00a0It was the eye that was stolen from her seven years ago.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I was so sure you were dead. Mu Jeong\u2026jin definitely threw you in the pit of snakes\u2026\u201dJeonghwa muttered unintelligibly.The situation in front of her cannot be understood with her common sense. When a person encounters a situation that transcends their common sense, it takes time for them to accept it as reality.That was how Jeonghwa felt right now. Her shaky eyes reflected her confusion.Jurreuk!As she received a big shock, her internal organs that had barely stabilized were agitated again, and blood flowed out of her mouth.Jeonghwa\u2019s complexion paled in an instant. It was not unusual for her to lose her breath quickly.At that moment, Pyo-wol reached out and grabbed her wrist and injected his qi. As Jeonghwa\u2019s internal organs and qi stabilized, the color of her face returned little by little.But Jeonghwa wasn\u2019t happy at all. Rather, she glared at Pyo-wol as if she was going to devour him.\u201cYou dirty assassin! How dare you hold my hands?\u201dShe shouted with all her might. It was so that someone from the outside could hear her voice. But despite her intentions, her voice remained soft.It was almost impossible to hear unless someone was in the room.Knowing that fact, Pyo-wol didn\u2019t care whether Jeonghwa screamed or not.\u00a0\u201cEven if you don\u2019t shout like that, I\u2019ll still kill you.\u201d\u201cWhat are you going to do with me?\u201d\u201cI told you. I\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d\u201cIf you kill me, how are you going to deal with the consequences? Do you think the Emei sect will leave you alone?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t stand still. Just like I did seven years ago.\u201dHe had already experienced how tenacious the Emei sect was seven years ago. He even reached the brink of death back then.\u00a0Maybe that is also why he didn\u2019t feel afraid at all despite Jeonghwa\u2019s threat. Back then, Pyo-wol was much weaker than he is now, and his preparations were insufficient.\u00a0But still, Pyo-wol ended up surviving.So now that he had done his preparations and he is a lot stronger, he had no reason to feel threatened by Jeonghwa.\u201cYou dirty assassin!\u201d\u201cOh, I know. Is it because of me that you\u2019re like this?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s me who killed Gongseon. I\u2019m also the one who killed the young master of the Thunder Gates.\u201d\u201cLies!\u201dJeonghwa harshly denied Pyo-wol\u2019s words. But Pyo-wol continued,\u201cIt\u2019s true, Gongseon stopped breathing as she was sleeping. Well, at least I let her die without pain. Killing the young master of the Thunder Gates wasn\u2019t difficult, too. Like what you said, I\u2019m a dirty assassin. So I enjoy hiding in the dark.\u201d\u201cAre, aren\u2019t you ashamed?\u201d\u201cI told you. I\u2019m an assassin. I was raised that way.\u201d\u201cStop your bullshit.\u201d\u201cYou and the Abbess of Nine Calamities commissioned the Blood Shadow Group to assassinate Woo Gunsang. So the Blood Shadow Group kidnapped me together with the other children and raised us as assassins. We\u2019re actually like your children. Because if it weren\u2019t for you, we would have never turned out to be assassins.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s just sophistry\u2013\u201d\u201cYou really think so? Is it sophistry?\u201dPyo-wol looked into Jeong-hwa\u2019s eyes. For a moment, Jeong-hwa trembled.It was because his red eyes, shining in the dark, seemed to eat away at her heart. Jeonghwa saw a vision as if a huge snake was hiding in the dark.The darkness seemed to stir every time the snake breathed.Pyo-wol was the giant snake.He was looking at Jeonghwa with completely still eyes. Neither malice nor fire were in his eyes.\u00a0Jeonghwa did not dare to breathe heavily. She seemed to understand why a rat in front of the snake gave up on escaping.Because that\u2019s how she feels now.Just by looking into Pyo-wol\u2019s eyes, her will to live was fizzling out.Jeonghwa shouted to shake off her fear.\u201cI, what do you want from me?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want anything. I just want to tell you.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think will happen to the Emei sect in the future?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cThe Emei sect will continue to fight the Qingcheng sect fiercely, because the\u00a0 Qingcheng sect\u2019s Cheongyeop is going to die tonight. The angry Qingcheng sect warriors will run to this place without hesitation. No matter what excuses you make, they will never listen. The death of the great disciple of such a prestigious sect would never dismiss an incident like that even with your excuses.\u201d\u201cYou, you\u2026!\u201dJeonghwa was unable to speak and trembled.Black blood continued to flow from her mouth. It was evidence that her injuries were getting worse. Jeonghwa was dying. Her emotional turmoil aggravated her internal injuries.The cause was Pyo-wol.Although Pyo-wol had not touched her, he was still greatly affecting Jeonghwa.\u201cOf course, there will be some who will question the situation, right? There are already a few who think that someone else was involved, like your Junior Sister Yong Seol-ran. She truly has some good sense.\u201dPyo-wol remembered Yong Seol-ran and smiled.\u201cBut it won\u2019t be of any use. Cheongyeop will be assassinated tonight using your Emei sect\u2019s signature technique, Pyoseol Cheonunjang.1\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThere was a copy of Pyoseol Cheonunjang in the clothes of an Emei disciple left in the underground cave after he died. So I learned it.\u201dJeonghwa opened her eyes wide and the corners of her eyes were torn. Blood from the wound ran into her eyes and mixed with tears. It looked like she was crying tears of blood.\u201cIt was just my luck that one of your junior brothers wanted to learn the Pyoseol Cheonunjang.\u201d\u201cOh, you devilish bastard! You will never be at peace when you die! You demon!\u201dAt that moment, Jeonghwa realized Pyo-wol\u2019s intentions and vomited all kinds of curses. However, Pyo-wol continued to speak without hesitation.\u201cThat is the picture I drew in my head. What do you think? It will be fun, right?\u201d\u201cS\u2026Stop it.\u201d\u201cThe disciples of both the Qingcheng sect and the Emei sect who came to Chengdu will be at war against each other. If that happens, even the monsters crouching on the mountain will no longer be able to sit. The Abbess of Nine Calamities, Mu Jeong-jin, and so on\u2013\u201d\u201cKeukek!\u201dJeonghwa had blood and foam form in her mouth.\u00a0Her anger swelled to the tip of her head, and her heart ached. Regardless, Pyo-wol continued.\u201cI\u2019m going to force them to go down the mountain. And I\u2019m going to rip them out of this world. As if they didn\u2019t exist in the first place.\u201dPyo-wol\u2019s last words were the final blow.Puck!\u201cKeuck!\u201dThe blood vessels in Jeonghwa\u2019s brain burst out of excessive anger and deepening. Her body could not withstand the excessive psychological pressure.Jeonghwa stopped breathing with the most painful expression in the world.\u00a0But Pyo-wol\u2019s words weren\u2019t over yet.\u201cTerrible, right? That there is someone like me in the world. It\u2019s terrible for me too. I\u2026\u201dPyo-wol\u2019s gaze turned to Jeonghwa.The figure of Pyo-wol was reflected on Jeonghwa\u2019s empty eyes that were weeping bloody tears.Pyo-wol asked the dead Jeonghwa.\u201cSo why did you raise someone like me?\u201d* * *Yong Seol-ran frowned.It was a habit to come out when she had a strange feeling.Although she didn\u2019t show it to anyone else, her martial arts skills had long surpassed Jeonghwa. It\u2019s just that she hasn\u2019t revealed her skills until now, for fear of getting caught up in troublesome things.As she had always done, she wanted to live quietly in the future. But the rapidly changing circumstances did not leave her alone.\u201cHuu! This is difficult.\u201dYong Seol-ran walked alone in the vicinity of the White Flower Room.Because the White Flower Room was a place that was carefully cared for, their residence was very beautiful.Around the large pond in Mount Seokga, all kinds of flowers were in bloom. The flowers that received the moonlight were showing off their beautiful appearance.\u00a0However, the eyes of Yong Seol-ran remained troubled.Even walking among the flowers did not calm her troubled mind at all. Rather, it felt like her heart was beating even more violently.It was then.\u201cSome, something\u2019s wrong! Senior Sister!\u201dAn Emei sect\u2019s second generation disciple ran to her with a shrill scream.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cJ, Jeonghwa, senior sist\u2014 has passed away.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dYong Seol-ran put on a look of disbelief.Although Jeonghwa\u2019s wounds were serious, Yong Seol-ran heard that Jeonghwa had survived the critical point. Yong Seol-ran couldn\u2019t believe that Jeonghwa\u2019s wounds had gotten worse and that she had died in that small amount of time.Yong Seol-ran hurried to the abode of Jeonghwa.In front of Jeonghwa\u2019s body, the physician and the disciples of the Emei sect had already gathered. In particular, the face of the clinician who treated Jeonghwa had turned white.It was because Jeonghwa died while he was away for a while.\u201cHow did this happen? Why is Senior Sister Jeonghwa\u2013?\u201d\u201cThat, I don\u2019t know either. I\u2019m sure her condition was stabilized\u2014\u201d\u201cWas she attacked?\u201d\u201cNo external injuries were found. From the presence of blood on the corners of the mouth, her internal wound appears to have worsened, making her vomit blood.\u201dThe physician hastily said what he knew.It was because he was afraid that he would be misunderstood that Jeonghwa was dead because of his own actions.The physician desperately argued that this had happened because Jeonghwa had expelled him from the room. His face was full of fear, fearing that the Emei sect might held him accountable.Yong Seol-ran looked at Jeonghwa\u2019s body while letting the physician\u2019s words pass through her ear. The dark red blood that soaked Jeonghwa\u2019s face and chest did not even come into her sight.\u00a0What Yong Seol-ran focused on observing was the one and only eye of Jeonghwa.Her eyes, which had lost focus, were filled with fear.\u00a0Jeonghwa was not the kind of person who would show her emotions like this simply because she was afraid of her own death. It was clear that something else caused her to be terrified.\u00a0Yong Seol-ran asked the physician.\u201cWhen was the last time you were away?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 was only half an hour ago.\u201dThe eyes of Yong Seol-ran shone.\u2018If it\u2019s half an hour, it hasn\u2019t been long yet.\u2019Yong Seol-ran hurried out of the White Flower Room.\u201cSister!\u201dBehind her, she heard the voices of the Emei disciples calling her, but Yong Seol-ran ignored them all. She came out of the residence and looked around for a moment.The street was dark, and she didn\u2019t feel a single presence.Yong Seol-ran climbed onto the tallest pavilion in the area. She released her qi and spread it throughout the area.If an ordinary warrior had spread their qi like this, they would have collapsed from exhaustion soon after. However, the internal energy of Yong Seol-ran was far deeper and vast than most people knew.Her qi spread throughout the area that seems to have no bounds. Beads of sweat formed on Yong Seol-ran\u2019s forehead.\u201cFound you.\u201dJust before her qi was exhausted, she finally sensed a foreign presence.At first, the presence was so faint that she thought it was a small animal such as a cat or a mouse moving. However, it was impossible for a cat or a mouse to move several meters at a time.\u2018North!\u2019Yong Seol-ran flew in the direction where the unknown person moved.She ran through the night sky of Chengdu like a shooting star.The further north she went, the stronger the opponent\u2019s presence was felt.\u00a0But at one point, the presence of the opponent she was chasing completely disappeared.\u201cWhat?\u201dYong Seol-ran stopped where the last presence of the opponent was sensed and looked around.\u00a0But there was no suspicious presence anywhere.\u201cWas it an illusion?\u201dYong Seol-ran immediately shook her head.Although it was only for a moment, she clearly felt the energy of an unfamiliar existence.It was neither a mouse nor a cat. It was obviously human.Yong Seol-ran narrowed her eyes and looked around. But she didn\u2019t feel anything either.She felt haunted. It was as if something invisible had made fun of her. Yong Seol-ran raised her senses once again with a confused expression. However, there were no suspicious signs anywhere.Yong Seol-ran eventually left the area helplessly.Shortly after she disappeared, someone walked out of the shade of a wall not far away.It was Pyo-wol who moved while masking his presence. Pyo-wol looked in the direction where Yong Seol-ran disappeared.\u2018She truly has good senses.\u2019Until now, no martial artist had successfully sensed his movements.Yong Seol-ran was the first person to detect his presence since he came into the world. However, once Pyo-wol made up his mind to completely hide his presence, she failed to notice him even though she was just a short distance away.If Pyo-wol was determined to hide his presence, there was no existence in the world that could find him. Just seeing Yong Seol-ran convinced Pyo-wol of his skills.Pyo-wol took another step.Now that his destination was not far away, there was no reason to carry out light footwork techniques.After a while, his destination appeared in front of him.Golden Gates.A member of the Three Gates and was the place where the disciples of the Qingcheng sect stayed.Like the White Flower Room, there was a strict security network at the Golden Gates. The faces of the warriors guarding the Golden Gate were all tired. But no one neglected their duty.\u201cWe don\u2019t know when the Emei sect will attack, so everyone, keep your guards up.\u201d\u201cThose dirty Emei sect bitches.\u201dIt was already dawn, but the warriors guarding the Golden Gate were burning with anger towards the Emei sect.Yesterday, they lost many of their colleagues to the Emei sect.\u00a0No matter how much they prevailed in the fight, the sadness of losing a comrade did not go away.Their feelings of sorrow turned into anger towards the Emei sect.Their eyes were full of fire as they stood on the lookout for the Emei sect, fearing that they would launch an attack.\u00a0But nonetheless.\u00a0No one noticed a black shadow infiltrating the Golden Gates like a snake.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was the Black Cloud Mercenary Group led by Heo Ran-ju and the Go Dosa.Go Dosa looked around the room and said.\u201cLooks like he had already left this place.\u201dThe room was empty. The blankets were neatly folded, and there was no trace of anyone lying on the bed.Hyeol Seung who looked closely inside the room said,\u201cHe didn\u2019t come here last night.\u201d\u201cDid he move out of the guest house knowing that we were going to attack him?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. It seems like he just paid for the room and didn\u2019t come in.\u201d\u201cHuu\u2026\u201dGo Dosa let out a sigh.Hyeol Seung was not only strong in martial arts, but he was also good at using his head. Because of this, Heo Ran-ju and the Go Dosa greatly trusted the judgment of Hyeol Seung.Go Dosa looked at Heo Ran-ju.\u201cWhat are we going to do? Should we just wait here for him to come back? Or do we retreat?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s no use waiting. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to come back here.\u201d\u201cWhy do you think so?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s the type of person who plans his movements so meticulously. He knows that he\u2019ll be the first one to be suspected, so why would he come back?\u201d\u201cYou got a point.\u201d\u201cI might be a crazy bitch who\u2019s obsessed with a person\u2019s looks. But I swear when we meet again, I\u2019m going to tear him apart.\u201dHeo Ran-ju looked like a poisonous snake. She thinks that she has been thoroughly abused by Pyo-wol.\u201cWe have to catch that person immediately.\u201d\u201cGo Dosa, do you think he will do more damage?\u201d\u201cDid you not see what he did? He\u2019s strong in martial arts, and he\u2019s even cruel. He is also heartless. If we let this guy run wild, the repercussions will never end.\u201dThe always smiling Go Dosa stopped smiling. It was proof that he was taking the situation seriously.The person who led the Black Cloud Mercenary Group was Zhang Mu-ryang, but the group\u2019s emotional support was Go Dosa.Go Dosa helped the Black Cloud Mercenary Group unite as one with his unique humorous atmosphere. However, Go Dosa was not just a good-natured person.He was the epitome of the common saying, a wolf in sheeps\u2019s clothing.1\u00a0He hides a knife in his laughter, making him even more terrifying.It was rare for Go Dosa to express his feelings so frankly. That was proof that he was accepting Pyo-wol as a threat.\u201cFrom the first time I saw it, I knew he was strong.\u201d\u201cDamn it! You didn\u2019t say that back then.\u201d\u201cDo I have to tell you? Anyway, be careful.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou fell in love with that bastard once.\u201d\u201cHey! When did I? I\u2019m Heo Ran-ju, the blood keeper. If I taste a guy, I will only eat them. I won\u2019t actually give them my heart.\u201d\u201cCome on! Keep that determination for a long time. If you give your heart to him for nothing, I will kill you first.\u201dFor a moment, Heo Ran-ju felt a chill in her spine.Although Go Dosa spoke with a smiling face, he was the type of man who could put his words into practice at any time.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t worry. It will never happen.\u201d\u201cHuh, of course.\u201dHe returned his characteristic smile. Still, Heo Ran-joo couldn\u2019t relax. Heo Ran-ju looked at the Hyeol Seung.\u201cWell, did you find anything?\u201d\u201cNot at all. He didn\u2019t leave a single trace.\u201d\u201cWhat the hell do you know how to do?\u201d\u201cAmitabul! Why are you singling me out? Do you think I\u2019m a punching bag or something?\u201dHyeol Seung sighed at the beatings of Heo Ran-ju. Go Dosa shook his head.\u201cHuu! These bastards can\u2019t stand still. By the way, do you have any idea where the guy went? Perhaps\u2026?\u201dAn ominous thought crept into his mind. However, Go Dosa quickly shook his head to deny his thoughts.\u201cNo! He probably won\u2019t.\u201d* * *Golden Gates has provided an annex for the recovery of Cheongyeop.It was an independent annex where he could recuperate without worrying about the outside world. As soon as Cheongyeop returned to the Golden Gate, he stayed in the annex and started meditating.He might have suppressed Jeonghwa, but in the process, he also suffered quite a few internal injuries. If not treated in a timely manner, he would have a deep internal wound that he would have to endure for the rest of his life.\u00a0But Cheongyeop wasn\u2019t worried.Fortunately, the Qingcheng sect had the Ungong Yosang1\u00a0method that can be used in such a case.Ungong Yosang, which has been developed for hundreds of years, has superior efficacy compared to other sects.Thanks to this, he was able to pass through a critical moment even though it had only been three hours since the method had been carried out.\u201cHuu!\u201dCheongyeop opened his eyes as he exhaled the breath he had trapped deep in his lungs. His eyes were clearer than before he came here.Still, he could not help but be bothered.It was because it was only a temporary measure of dealing with his internal injuries and not a proper treatment.In order to completely heal his internal injuries, he had to go back to the Qingcheng sect, take the necessary pills, and focus on practicing the Ungong Yosang for more than two or three months.\u201cBut should we be satisfied with the suppression of Jeonghwa for now?\u201dThe battle between Jeonghwa and Cheongyeop was not a simple fight.Each of them was a great disciple of their own sect and they were martial artists who are likely to be the next generation of sect leaders. Their confrontation was a confrontation between the Emei sect and Qingcheng sect, and it was a battle that could determine which sect the flow of the Sichuan would fall to in the future.Fortunately, Cheongyeop managed to overwhelm Jeonghwa.This meant that the Qingcheng sect could overwhelm the Emei sect in the next era as well. Even if the Emei sect or Jeonghwa denied the outcome, others who have watched their fight will think otherwise.It was such an important fight, so Cheong-yeop gave his all to win.\u201cHuh! I\u2019ll have to rest for a while and then get back on board.\u201dThat was then.Ssreuk!A strange voice reached Cheongyeop\u2019s ears.Someone is coming into the place where he is staying. At first, he thought it was no big deal.No matter how detached the annex was, the disciples of the Qingcheng sect are still guarding it, and some of them regularly monitor and report the condition of the Cheongyeop.It was not at all strange to sense a presence at times.However, Cheongyeop felt a strong sense of incongruity.It was because of the soft footsteps.No matter how careful the disciples of the Qingcheng sect were, they could not lighten the sound of their footsteps like this.\u2018Then is it the Golden Gate\u2019s sect leader? No! If it\u2019s him, there\u2019s no reason to hide his footsteps like this.\u2019Cheongyeop got up from his cross-legged seat.At that moment, the door quietly opened and someone came in.The moment he saw the person who came in unexpectedly, a deep frown broke out between Cheongyeop\u2019s forehead.Because the face of the uninvited guest is so handsome.The beautiful appearance that makes a woman fall in love with him the moment she sees him and his bright red eyes even in the dark alarmed Cheongyeop.Cheongyeop said while holding the sword that was standing next to him.\u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cPyo-wol.\u201dThe man, Pyo-wol, revealed his identity.Cheongyeop tilted his head. Because it was the first time he had ever heard such a name. However, Cheongyeop continued talking without panicking.\u201cOkay. Pyo-wol! Why did you hide like a stray cat at this midnight hour?\u201d\u201cThere is no one who sneaks in at night and comes with a good purpose. The same goes for me.\u201d\u201cI asked a stupid question.\u00a0 The one who comes is not good, the one who is good will not come.3\u201cCheongyeop\u2019s expression stiffened.\u201cI ask one last question. Did you possibly kill the young master of the Thunder Gates?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cSo it was you. Could I possibly know why you killed him?\u201d\u201cTo attract the attention of the Qingcheng sect.\u201dPyo-wol answered meekly. He knew the reason why Cheongyeop was talking like this was to get stall for as much time as possible.It didn\u2019t matter though.\u00a0Because Pyo-wol already suppressed all the soldiers who were already guarding the annex.Cheongyeop gave him a suspicious look.\u201cHave you ever had a Bon school and Eun Won? Why are you bringing the Qingcheng sect?\u201d\u201cI have a grudge on both the Qingcheng sect and Emei sect.\u201d\u201cEmei? If that\u2019s the case then it must be your fault that a disciple of the Emei sect died.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dPyo-wol gently nodded his head. Cheongyeop\u2019s expression darkened.He was wasting time by talking to Pyo-wol, but still, no disciple from outside came running. It meant that Pyo-wol completely took over the space.Cheongyeop said, secretly raising his internal energy.\u201cA person who has a grudge against both the Qingcheng sect and Emei sect. I don\u2019t think there was such a person. Can you tell me who you really are?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m an assassin.\u201d\u201cAssassin?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like you remember. Anyway, because of the Emei sect, I was raised as an assassin, and became the public enemy of the Qingcheng sect.\u201d\u201cAre you talking about what happened seven years ago?\u201d\u201cI guess you still remembered. It seems you\u2019re not that stupid.\u201d\u201cThen you are the assassin who killed Woo Gunsang.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dPyo-wol nodded his head. A cold smile hung on his lips.\u00a0In comparison, Cheongyeop\u2019s expression hardened even more. Because it reminded him of that day seven years ago.It was the Qingcheng sect that boasted the most thorough security\u00a0 network in Sichuan. It was seven years ago that their self-esteem was broken.It was the Cheongseong school that boasted the most thorough boundary network in Sichuan. It was seven years ago that such self-esteem was broken.One day, an assassin successfully ambushed Woo Gunsang, the rising member of the Qingcheng sect. This not only brought a huge shock to the Qingcheng sect, but also to the entire Sichuan.The elite disciples of the Qingcheng sect and the Emei sect were involved in a case of chasing the assassin who killed Woo Gunsang together with the numerous sects in Sichuan Province who helped them.Cheongyeop\u2019s trembling is not simply because Pyo-wol assassinated Woo Gunsang.Pyo-wol revealed the truth of the incident by luring the disciples of the Emei sect and the Qingcheng sect through an underground joint venture.After that day, the Emei sect and the Qingcheng sect became the irreconcilable enemies.The source of all the incidents was the assassin standing right in front of him.Pyo-wol was covering the lower crown of his face with a scarf. Cheongyeop knew what that meant.\u201cPyo-wol! I will never forget that name!\u201dCheongyeop raised his sword.Although he still hasn\u2019t fully healed from his wounds, he did not doubt that he would not be able to handle a single assassin.No matter how deeply wounded he was, he was still the one one who would become the next sect leader of the Qingcheng sect. If he couldn\u2019t even handle a single assassin, he had nothing to say if he was stripped of his position as a great disciple.\u201cPyo-wol! You made a big mistake today. You had to just hide in the dark until the end. If you did, you would have saved your insignificant life for a few more days.\u201dShuaack!Cheongyeop\u2019s sword cut through the darkness, and a fierce sword energy flew towards Pyo-wol. However, Pyo-wol shook off the sword\u2019s energy by moving to the side and then he rushed forward.He did not take out the ghost knife or the Soul-Reaping Thread4, which he has been using frequently.It was not Aguido, a German martial artist, but the Emei\u2019s technique, Pyoseol Cheonunjang that killed Cheongyeop today.Pyoseol Cheonunjang was very difficult to learn due to the philosophy of the Emei sect.Without mastering the depths of Emei, it would have been impossible to even dream of displaying its true power.However, Pyo-wol replaced Emei\u2019s deep philosophy with the Sub-Thunder Snake method.As a result, Pyoseol Cheonunjang became more shady and destructive.\u00a0It actually transcended the power of the original.Kwaang!As Pyo-wol swung his hand, fierce pressure struck Cheongyeop.Cheongyeop swung his sword to try and repel the tension.Bang!The bounced energy struck the wall of the annex and made it collapse. The wall shook precariously as if the outbuildings were about to collapse at any moment.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that the residence of the brother Cheongyeop?\u201dAt the sudden commotion, the disciples of the Qingcheng sect and the Golden Gates ran out in worry. At that moment, the two men broke through the roof of the annex and soared into the air.One was Cheongyeop, and the other was a unidentifiable man who had his face half-covered with a scarf.Cheongyeop wanted to announce Pyo-wol\u2019s true identity right now.However, when he tried to open his mouth while spreading his qi, because of his deep internal wound, his qi ended up scattering and thus flowed back.Because of that, Cheongyeop couldn\u2019t say anything and had to unleash his sword techniques with his lips closed.\u2018I just have to subdue him. It\u2019s not too late to reveal his identity after I overpower him.\u2019Shuaack!His sword pierced the darkness and shot towards Pyo-wol. However, Pyo-wol escaped the sword energy of Cheongyeop just by narrowly dodging in the air.The disciples of the Qingcheng sect tried to help Cheongyeop, but the fight between the two was so intense that they did not dare to intervene.At that moment, Pyo-wol unleashes the Pyoseol Cheonunjang.Hoo-woong!A force of immense power, incomparable to anything before, was shot towards Cheongyeop.\u201cIs that the Pyoseol Cheonunjang?\u201d\u201cThen is that person an Emei sect\u2019s warrior?\u201dSome soldiers of the Qingcheng sect recognized Pyo-wol\u2019s swordsmanship technique. This is because Pyoseol Cheonunjang was such a famous attack.\u201cSomething like this\u2026\u201dCheongyeop pulled up all of his remaining inner strength and put it in his sword. The intention was to cut through the incoming energy at once.All of his internal energy would be exhausted, but he expected that the disciples of the Qingcheng sect would come running to help him.He swung his sword with all his might.Hoo-hung!But his sword tore through the air in vain. Cheongyeop widened his eyes.Because the impossible happened.It was impossible even in a dream to miss a sword that had been trained for decades. Cheongyeop looked at his legs involuntarily. Because he felt something wrapped around his leg.\u00a0It was a thread of qi, which could not be distinguished with the naked eye.At the decisive moment, Pyo-wol used the Soul-Reaping Thread and disturbed the balance of Cheongyeop. The subtle difference made the Cheongyeop fail to deflect the incoming attack.Bang!At the chest of Cheongyeop, traces of the Pyoseol Cheonunjang could be seen.\u201cKeuk!\u201dCheongyeop let out a desperate scream and fell to the floor.\u201cSenior Brother!\u201d\u201cOh, no!\u201dThe disciples of Qingcheng sect and Golden Gates ran in haste.\u00a0But by the time they arrived, Cheongyeop had already stopped breathing and died.In the face of Cheongyeop\u2019s terrible death, the Qingcheng sect and Golden Gates warriors lost their minds.\u201cFollow him!\u201d\u201cThe Emei sect killed Senior Brother Cheongyeop!\u201d\u201cWe must take revenge!\u201dThe disciples of Qingcheng sect and Golden Gates simultaneously lost their reason.In front of them, Cheongyeop lost his life because of the Emei sect\u2019s swordsmanship technique. They thought that Emei had sent a highly skilled warrior to get revenge.The disciples ran out without anyone stopping them.Their destination was the White Flower Room where the disciples of Emei stayed.\u201cAHH!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s drive the dirty Emei disciples out of the city!\u201d\u201cWe must take revenge on behalf of Senior Brother Cheongyeop!\u201dThe night streets of Chengdu were filled with their voices.The night sky of Chengdu, which had barely calmed down, began to be dyed with blood again.Hoped everyone enjoyed the chapter~ Don\u2019t forget to comment down below what you think of the chapter <3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 73": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 73Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayPeople called that morning the Bloody River and Corpse Mountain Day.1It\u2019s a day when blood flows and forms like a river, and bodies pile up like a mountain.That morning, the Emei disciples in the White Flower Room were attacked by the Qingcheng sect and Golden Gates warriors.The warriors, who lost their reason at the death of Cheongyeop, attacked the White Flower Room. The warriors of the Emei sect who were in the White Flower Room were also in a situation where their nerves were sharply raised over Jeonghwa\u2019s death.They exploded their anger against the Qingcheng sect warriors who suddenly attacked. So they clashed once more, and inflicted great damage on each other.Yong Seol-ran somehow tried to control the Emei sect\u2019s disciples, but it was to no avail.\u00a0The Emei sect disciples thought that Jeonghwa\u2019s death was due to the Qingcheng sect, while the Qingcheng sect thought that Cheongyeop\u2019s death was caused by a highly skilled warrior hired by the Emei sect.All of these happened because of misunderstandings and schemes of Pyo-wol. But no one had figured that out.The disciples from both sects just needed something to pour out their anger. So the two forces clashed, and left the worst damage.The White Flower Room, which had become a battlefield, was mercilessly destroyed and stained with the blood of countless warriors.The fight between the two factions continued for almost half a day.\u00a0It was truly a fight to the death.It could not even be compared with the battle that had taken place the day before.They became demons and killed each other.Their fighting was so devastating that everyone who lived nearby had to abandon their houses and evacuate. Later, when they returned home, what they saw was a completely destroyed White Flower Room. The White Flower Room itself was like a huge tomb.It wasn\u2019t just the destruction of the base.Geum Ha-ryeon, the sect leader of the White Flower Room, also lost her life on that day.The Qingcheng sect and Golden Gates, who attacked first, also suffered heavy damage.In that battle, a total of about 500 soldiers from both sides were killed or injured. As the fighting between the two sides grew, the damage grew out of control since nearby affiliated sects also joined the fight to help them.\u201cNo\u2013!\u201dLooking at the White Flower Room that had collapsed overnight, Yong Seol-ran made an expression of disbelief.Her whole body was stained with blood.The only reason the Emei sect was able to endure this much was because she showed her true prowess. Her whole body was stained red with the blood of the Qingcheng sect warriors.It was like having a nightmare.Clashed with Qingcheng sect in broad daylight, with Jeonghwa dying that same night. And at dawn, they fought the Qingcheng sect again until everything was destroyed.She couldn\u2019t believe that all of this had happened in just two days.Yong Seol-ran had always thought that she could handle any adversity. She believed that she was confident in her own inaction and that he had a bold personality.But in the face of a terrible disaster that happened overnight, she could not think of anything.It felt like her mind was empty.She couldn\u2019t think of anything.She felt like her soul had gone out.\u201cYoung Miss Seol-ran!\u201dIt was someone\u2019s soft voice that brought her back to reality.When she came to her senses and looked back, she saw Zhang Mu-ryang, who was leading the Black Cloud Mercenary Group.The Black Clouds Mercenary took part in the fight at the last minute.Because they participated in the war, the war was finally able to end at this level. If the Black Clouds Mercenary hadn\u2019t participated in the war, it would have been possible that all the soldiers of the Emei sect here would have been slaughtered by the warriors of the Qingcheng sect.Yong Seol-ran took over Zhang Mu-ryang.\u201cAh! Thank you for your help, Sir Zhang. Thanks to you, many of our people have survived.\u201d\u201cI did it because of the contract anyway. Don\u2019t worry about it. I have something to tell you.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t we transfer to somewhere else where it\u2019s quiet?\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dYong Seol-ran nodded, while Zhang Mu-ryang had an unsettled expression on his face.The two went together to a deserted place. After confirming that no one was around, Zhang Mu-ryang carefully opened his mouth.\u201cDoes Young Miss Seol-ran think that today\u2019s event was a coincidence?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cI asked if you thought it was a coincidence that the Qingcheng sect\u2019s warriors attacked.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think there are coincidences in Jianghu. So tell me, why did you bring this up?\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then it makes sense. Actually, there is a person we met by chance while coming to Chengdu and accompanied him. However, the person\u2019s movements were unusual.\u201d\u201cTell me more.\u201dYong Seol-ran\u2019s eyes lit up.It was because something came to mind the moment she heard Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s words.\u201cHis name is Pyo-wol. He\u2013\u201dZhang Mu-ryang told her everything he knew about Pyo-wol. How Pyo-wol treated Heo Ran-ju and how he killed Jo Jeoksan and Seol-pyo.Yong Seol-ran didn\u2019t say a word the whole time she was listening to the story. But her eyes were full of certainty.\u2018Then it\u2019s certain. He is the one who\u2019s responsible for separating our sect and the Qingcheng sect.\u2019A person can sometimes find out the truth by just hearing a few words. It was the same case with Yong Seol-ran right now.\u00a0Yong Seol-ran was convinced that Pyo-wol was the mastermind behind the unusual flow of events.\u201cDid you say his name is Pyo-wol?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I heard.\u201d\u201cWhere is he now?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. I sent some of my members to get him, but they said they could not find him.\u201d\u201cYou must catch him. It is clear that the reason why the Qingcheng sect attacked us today is because of him as well.\u201d\u201cYou think he was the one who killed Young Master Cheongyeop.\u201d\u201cThe Qingcheng sect said that the one who killed Cheongyeop used one of our sect\u2019s martial arts. However, among the disciples of our sect who have come to Chengdu, I am the only one who can use the Pyoseol Cheonunjang. And of course, it wasn\u2019t me who killed Cheongyeop.\u201d\u201cSo you think he killed the Young Master Cheongyeop? But they said he was killed using the Emei sect\u2019s martial arts\u2013\u201d\u201cOther than that, the current situation cannot be explained.\u201d\u201cHuu!\u201dZhang Muliang let out a sigh.It was obviously the Qingcheng sect\u2019s negligence that killed the young master of the Thunder Gates. If he had also learned the Emei sect\u2019s martial arts, the problem becomes more serious.\u201cSo, he\u2019s a monster who has learned both the martial arts of the Qingcheng sect, and the Emei sect.\u201d\u201cFor now, we have no choice but to think that way.\u201d\u201cHow the hell was such a terrible being born? Judging by the conflict he instigated between the Emei sect and the Qingcheng sect, he seems to have great resentment towards the two sects. Do you have any guess on who it could be?\u201d\u201cHow could there be someone like\u2026\u201dYong Seol-ran abruptly ended her speech.Because there was someone who suddenly came to her mind.\u2018But he\u2019s dead\u2014 No! Wait, what if he was alive?\u2019In an instant, goosebumps spread all over her body. She had just made one assumption, but all the incidents started to fit together like cogs.Above all, her sixth sense was telling her that her assumption was correct.\u2018More than anything else, there is no other assassin who has a deep grudge against both the Emei sect and the Qingcheng sect.\u2019In an instant, his face came to her mind. It was a distant memory, but his face was still vivid in her mind. Her memories of him were so strong.\u201cWe don\u2019t have time to be like this right now. If we let him run like this, things will get worse and worse.\u201d\u201cBefore that, there is something I want to ask the Young Miss Seol-ran.\u201dZhang Mu-ryang\u2019s voice lowered. His eyes were shining brighter than ever.\u201cWhy is he doing this? Don\u2019t we need to know the reason to know how to deal with him?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t tell you that.\u201d\u201cYoung Miss Seol-ran!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dYong Seol-ran cut off the conversation.Seven years ago, the incident was caused by the Emei sect\u2019s sect leader. A tragedy caused by the greed of the Abbess of Nine Calamities.\u00a0So, Yong Seol-ran couldn\u2019t share the backstory with others.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I want to tell you, but I can\u2019t. It\u2019s not something I can decide on my own. Sir Zhang must be frustrated, but I hope you will be patient until our Master has come to a decision.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dZhang Mu\u2013ryang took a step back.He realized that if he pressures Yong Seol-ran for answers any more than this, he would only get her antipathy.Yong Seol-ran closed her eyes.\u2018He\u2019s back\u2026\u2019She also found out for the first time today that his name was Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol used to make fun of the Qingcheng sect and the Emei sect even when he was an assassin. He risked his own life to bring the two forces into an underground cave, eventually causing them to clash.He was already scary back then, but she was afraid to even imagine how scary he must have become now, seven years later.\u2018Pyo-wol!\u2019* * *The atmosphere of Chengdu became ferocious.The fight between the Qingcheng sect and the Emei sect had exacerbated the public sentiment.\u00a0People were terrified. The streets were completely deserted, and people hid in their homes. People instinctively knew that something bigger was going to happen.The two largest forces in Sichuan Province, the Qingcheng sect and the Emei sect, were almost completely annihilated in Chengdu.The two sects would not just stand still. They will definitely send more of their reinforcements to Chengdu. And if they do, this only proves the idea that Chengdu would be destroyed.In any case, it was hard to see who would suffer the most damage. People with no power would definitely be the first ones to die. For that reason, those who were quick-witted had to leave the city early.Some guest houses completely locked their doors and did not accept guests.Pyo-wol walked alone on a completely deserted street.He left Chengdu and headed for a shop in the Fire Dragon Room.No one paid any attention to Pyo-wol. Everyone was busy taking care of themselves. The workshop street where the shop of the Fire Dragon Room was located was quiet.Since most of the workshops were closed, there were no guests. They also recognized that the atmosphere of Chengdu was serious.Due to the nature of the workshop where weapons were made and sold, the streets of this place had no choice but to be affected by the incident in Chengdu.If you do business on a day like this for nothing, disputes among the martial artists may arise, so the workshop is taking care of it.The Fire Dragon Room\u2019s shop was also closed.Pyo-wol looked at the shop\u2019s door with a frown. Because there was a dull noise coming from inside the door.Pouck! Puck!It wasn\u2019t the sound of an iron being hit by a hammer. Rather, it was a dull sound when someone is being hit by a blunt weapon.\u00a0Pyo-wol opened the door.It was initially locked but with just a little bit of pressure from Pyo-wol, it easily opened.Inside the workshop, four men were ruthlessly beating a man. And a man with a goatee was watching the scene with his arms crossed.The men who were using violence were startled to see Pyo-wol who suddenly opened the workshop door and entered.\u201cYou are?\u201d\u201cWhat? How did you get in?\u201dThe blacksmith apprentices asked.\u00a0Tang Sochu was the target of their terrible violence. Tang Sochu was lying on the floor while wiggling his bloodied body.\u00a0A goatee-bearded man stepped forward.\u201cYou\u2019re the customer who came the other day.\u201dBuntaju was the de facto manager of Fire Dragon Room\u2019s shop. Buntaju remembered Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol looked at Tang Sochu without saying a word. Then, Buntaju\u00a0 smiled and blocked the front of Pyo-wol.\u201cThis is inside the main room. Customers are not allowed here.\u201d\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t tell you. If you want to get weapons, go to another workshop. Our workshop is closed for the time being.\u201dBuntaju gave strength to push Pyo-wol. But Pyo-wol did not budge.The face of Buntaju, which had used his strength to push Pyo-wol, turned red. He realized that Pyo-wol was a master of martial arts so he withdrew.\u201cI don\u2019t know which sect you are from, but please step back. If you meddle in the affairs of the Fire Dragon Room, you will have a bad experience.\u201dBuntaju especially emphasized the word \u201cFire Dragon Room\u201d.Once the name of the Fire Dragon Room was mentioned, people would immediately back off. However, the Fire Dragon Room did not pose a threat at all to Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol was still looking at Buntaju.Tang Sochu also raised his head with difficulty and looked at Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol said to him.\u201cDecide.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you want to leave?\u201dFor a moment, Tang Sochu\u2019s eyes trembled.Because he understood what Pyo-wol meant.Today he did nothing wrong. He didn\u2019t grab a hammer, and he didn\u2019t come near the furnace. Still, he was beaten by the apprentices. And even Buntaju encouraged the violence of the apprentices and left him alone.The only sin he has is that he was born with the Tang surname. But even then, he didn\u2019t have a choice on his last name, but people hated him and harassed him.It was now taken for granted that tormenting him was taken for granted, and the people in the workshop also used violence as a substitute for anger.As a result, his body was torn apart, and his resentment reached its peak.Tang Sochu struggled to get up.The sight of his legs trembling like aspen trees was a pity for everyone who saw it.\u201cJust stay still, kid.\u201dBouck!An apprentice slapped the back of the head of Tang Sochu. Tang Chou couldn\u2019t stand the blow and his face was planted on the floor.\u00a0His nose was broken and blood dripped from his mouth and chin. Tang Sochu tried to turn his head and looked at Pyo-Yeol.Their eyes met in the air.\u00a0Then the Tang Sochu said:\u201cCan you kill them?\u201d\u201cAll of them?\u201d\u201cAll of them!\u201d\u201cThen what can you do for me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do anything you want.\u201dTang Sochu lifted his head and looked at Pyo-wol.His eyes were as empty as Pyo-wol.His emotions were worn out by repeated violence.Pyo-wol smiled at his appearance, which bore a resemblance to himself.\u201cOkay.\u201dHoped everyone enjoyed the chapter~ Don\u2019t forget to comment down below what you think of the chapter <3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 74": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 74Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cWhat are you talking about, customer!\u201dBuntaju made an expression of absurdity.Pyo-wol was the first person who dared to make such a statement in the shop of Fire Dragon Room.A ferocious energy emanated from his whole body.Buntaju in Fire Dragon Room wasn\u2019t anything different from the other members of the sect. He was also one of the most respected masters in the Fire Dragon Room.He usually acts humble in front of the guests, but in reality, he was a tyrant in the Fire Dragon Room. However, Pyo-wol did not feel threatened.Pyo-wol said to Tang Sochu.\u201cI\u2019ll show you how I use the ghost knife you made for me.\u201dCiiit!At that moment, a ghost knife was released from his waist.\u201cGeugh!\u201dBuntaju flew backwards with a shriek. Suddenly, a dagger was buried deep in his forehead, leaving only the handle.\u201cHiiiic!\u201d\u201cBuntaju\u201dThe apprentices shouted in surprise, but the breathing of Butanju had already stopped.\u201cUgh! You madman!\u201dDang! Dang! Dang!An apprentice rang the emergency bell next to him. Then, warriors came out from inside the workshop.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dSince they were warriors guarding the workshop, they all had vicious weapons in their hands. One of the apprentices said, pointing a finger at Pyo-wol.\u201cThat crazy bastard killed Buntaju!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dIt was only then that the soldiers discovered the dagger stuck in the forehead of Buntaju.\u201cCatch him!\u201d\u201cCrazy bastard!\u201dThe warriors rushed towards Pyo-wol. At that moment, Pyo-wol flicked his hand.Cit! Ciiiit!The ghost knives were released over and over again.\u201cKeuk!\u201d\u201cGargh!\u201dOne life was taken with each dagger.\u00a0In an instant, a dozen or so warriors lost their lives.\u00a0\u201cKekkeuh!\u201dThe man who had his heart pierced by the last dagger fell to his knees. Pyo-wol recovered the dagger using Soul-Reaping Thread.\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cWhat, what?\u201dThe apprentices looked up in horror. It was a tragedy that happened in the blink of an eye. The warriors of their workshop were easily wiped out by Pyo-wol, not even giving them any time to respond.\u00a0The apprentices did not know what to do with the sight that they could not believe with their own eyes.At that moment, Pyo-wol once again wielded the Soul-Reaping Thread. Then the ghost knife with the thread attached to it drew a parabola and flew away in the air like a shooting star.Ciiit!The ghost knife ran through the apprentices\u2019 necks in an instant. The apprentices could not even scream, they just grabbed their necks and fell.In an instant, the workshop was stained with blood.With the exception of Pyo-wol and Tang Sochu, there are no longer any living person in the workshop.He killed more than ten people in an instant, but there was no guilt on Pyo-wol\u2019s face. The Fire Dragon Room participated in the quest to catch him seven years ago.Knowing that fact, Pyo-wol had no hesitation in his hands.Tang Sochu struggled to get up.Even though the hellish landscape was right before his eyes, there was no change in the expression on Tang Sochu\u2019s face. He looked at Pyo-wol without paying attention to the corpses.\u201cYou can use the ghost monument like that.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s called the Soul-Reaping Thread, I can only use one yet.\u201d\u201cIf you pull out all ten with your fingers, you might be able to use all ten ghost knives.\u201d\u201cTheoretically,Tang Sochu laughed as if he liked Pyo-wol\u2019s answer.\u201cHahaha! That\u2019s great. It\u2019s really\u2026 great.\u201dHe looked at the Soul-Reaping Thread and the Ghost Knives. His heart was pounding at the thought that the weapon he had made would show off the best power because of its harmony with the Soul-Reaping Thread.His body was beaten up black and blue, but he couldn\u2019t feel any pain.Even though all the soldiers and apprentices of the shop had died, there was no sympathy on the face of Tang Sochu.If a stranger dies, he will not look like this. To him, the people here were only objects of hatred. Their deaths did not shake Tang Sochu.Tang Sochu asked Pyo-wol.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad for their demise, but the Fire Dragon Room won\u2019t be idle.\u201d\u201cI guess you haven\u2019t heard the news yet.\u201d\u201cWhat news?\u201d\u201cThe catastrophe of the Qingcheng sect and the Emei sect.\u201d\u201cSo?\u201dTang Sochu\u2019s eyes gleamed with anticipation. Everyone in their shop was nervous about it.Pyo-wol nodded his head.\u201cI caused all of that.\u201d\u201cHa ha ha!\u201dTang Sochu burst out laughing. Because he remembered the first time he met Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol said that he would fight against the Qingcheng sect and the Emei sect. At the time, he honestly didn\u2019t believe it. Because the story was completely unrealistic. But now there was no reason not to believe it. Because the circumstantial evidence is so clear.Tang Sochu asked.\u201cYou need my help, right?\u201d\u201cA lot.\u201d\u201cWhat can I help you with?\u201dTang Sochu\u2019s face was bright with madness.* * *Bang!A large table was shattered.The Abbess of Nine Calamities, who could not hold back her anger, struck the table with her fist. Even though the fragments of the shattered table were completely scattered, the Emei\u2019s masters still did not blink an eye.It was because they were as angry as Guhwasata. There was a letter in the hands of the Guhwasata. The letter arrived this morning using a carrier pigeon.Inside the letter, Jeonghwa\u2019s death and the circumstances in Chengdu were written in detail.Jeonghwa\u2019s death made Guhwasata explode in anger.\u00a0\u201cWhat kind of child is Jeonghwa\u2026 to kill that child.\u201dJeonghwa was an Emei sect\u2019s great disciple.The death of other disciples were also heartbreaking, but the death of the great disciple, Jeong-hwa, affected her in a special way.Jeonghwa was her first disciple.There were many times she was disappointment of Jeonghwa\u2019s shortcomings, but nonetheless, she was the first disciple she accepted. So it felt even worse.Guhwasata bowed her head and took a deep breath.Her reaction might seem cold to others, but it was never easy to contain her emotions after the death of the disciple. However, as an ambitious person who challenges the hegemony of Sichuan, she eventually overcame the intense emotions within a short time.A moment later, when she raised her head again, a chill lingered in her eyes.\u201cLet\u2019s get things sorted out. The assassin who killed Woo Gunsang seven years ago survived and provoked the conflict between the Emei and the Qingcheng factions. He\u2019s also using both the martial arts of both the Qingcheng and Emei sect. The Qingcheng sect\u2019s martial arts might have been secretly passed to him by the Blood Shadow Group but how did he learn our sect\u2019s martial arts? Furthermore, it\u2019s the Pyoseol Cheonunjang?\u201dPyoseol Cheonunjang was a martial art that should never be leaked to the outside as a result of ascension. The fact that Pyo-wol had mastered such martial arts could not be understood by the Guhwasata.\u201cI\u2026\u201dAt that moment, Cheolsim carefully opened her mouth.Cheolsim was the junior sister of Jeonghwa. Since Jeonghwa died, she was the next most influential person. Guhwasata looked at Cheolsim.\u201cTell me.\u201d\u201cIs it possible that Gong-un\u2019s copy was leaked?\u201d\u201cGong-un? You mean the kid who died in the underground cave?\u201d\u201cYes. This disciple heard that he was allowed to learn Pyoseol Cheonunjang and thus had a copy.\u201d\u201cYou mean he went into the underground cave carrying a copy?\u201d\u201cIt seems to be the case.\u201d\u201cCrazy! For him to go out with a copy. Is he crazy?!\u201dBang!In an instant, Guhwasata struck the handle of the chair. Then the handle turned to powder and broke. Everyone held their breath in the anger of the Guhwasata.\u201cBut how did he learn Pyoseol Cheonunjang without the depths of our sect? Is that even possible?\u201d\u201cCommon sense is impossible, but for now, there is no other possibility that comes to mind.\u201dCheolsim shrugged her shoulders as if he had committed a crime.Guhwasata bit her lip softly.She also knew that the Cheolsim\u2019s guess was valid. However, she did not want to admit that one day an assassin stole and learned the martial arts of the prestigious Emei sect.\u00a0It was because the Emei sect\u2019s self-esteem was at stake.It took a long time for Guhwasata to accept reality. Anyway, for now, she found Cheolsim\u2019s words the most plausible.\u201cSo, it means that he has learned both the Seventy-Two Sword Waves of the Qingcheng sect and the Pyoseol Cheonunjang of our sect. Furthermore, he has a bitter grudge against us. Is that right?\u201d\u201cIt seems so.\u201d\u201cKeuk! To think the day would come where a mere assassin would dare harass our Emei sect. Does the Qingcheng faction know this?\u201d\u201cThey already firmly believe that our sect is the one responsible for killing Cheongyeop. No matter what we say, they won\u2019t believe it.\u201d\u201cYes. They won\u2019t believe us until they catch the assassin and show them the real thing.\u201dThe Qingcheng sect will not believe the words of the Emei sect. This is because of the original sin that the Emei sect had already committed seven years ago.At the center of it was the Guhwasata.Her decision led to today\u2019s tragedy. But nevertheless, she never regretted her decision. Her dream of making the Emei sect the leader of Sichuan was still in progress.At that time, the middle-aged man warrior, who had been silent until now, opened his mouth.\u201cSect leader!\u201d\u201cWhat is it, Jang Pyeong?\u201dThe middle-aged warrior was the head of Fog Valley Temple1, one of the branches of the Emei sect. He was the first disciple that was accepted after the Guhwasata opened the doors of the Emei sect to men.Until now, he had little to say because of the spirit of Jeonghwa, but in terms of his martial arts skills, he was never inferior to Jeonghwa.\u201cIf you give me permission, I\u2019ll catch the assassin.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s dangerous.\u201d\u201cIt would be dangerous if we didn\u2019t know of his existence, but knowing his existence like this, there\u2019s no danger at all if we can appropriate prepare for it. So, please let me go.\u201d\u201cNo! I will catch him myself.\u201d\u201cAre you saying that the sect leader will go down the mountain herself?\u201dJang Pyeong was startled by the remarks of the Guhwasataand stood up. It was the same with the other disciples.\u201cThis would not take long.\u201d\u201cHow can the sect leader move on her own? Furthermore for just a lowly assassin.\u201dThe disciples tried to stop Guhwasata. However, the decision of the Guhwasata was firm.\u201cAnyway, his ultimate goal is me. If I stay still, he will surely come to the main sect.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u201dGuhwasata was sure of her judgment.\u2018From the beginning, his target was me. It\u2019s clear that he was the one who caused this incident to attack me. I should have definitely eliminated him back then.\u2019She resented Mu Jeong-jin of the Qingcheng sect.If he had definitely removed Pyo-wol then\u00a0 nothing like today would have happened. When she thought that this happened because of the incompetence of Mu Jeong-jin, her anger against the Qingcheng sect rose even more.\u201cCheolsim!\u201d\u201cYes, master!\u201d\u201cYou will be in charge of the main sectfor the time being.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201d\u201cI will go and catch the assassin. I will be back soon, so hold on for a while. Jang Pyeong!\u201d\u201cYes, sect leader!\u201d\u201cYou help Cheolsim.\u201d\u201cI will.\u201d\u201cIf anything difficult happens, visit Baekwol Samseung and ask for her help.\u201dBaekwol Samseung was the best of the Emei sect\u2019s warriors.After Guhwasata took over as the sect leader, she stopped paying attention to world affairs and entered closed training. Because of Guhwasata, they could focus on training and leave the sect with a peace of mind.\u201cHow dare a lowly assassin cause such a mess. I will definitely catch him and tear him into a thousand pieces before I kill him.\u201dA vicious light flashed in Guhwasata\u2019s eyes.On that day, the Guhwasata came down Mt. Emei with two hundred elite members of the Emei sect.Hoped everyone enjoyed the chapter~ Don\u2019t forget to comment down below what you think of the chapter <3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 75": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 75Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEveryone looked at the coffin which lay in the middle.The body of Cheongyeop, a great disciple of the Qingcheng sect, was contained in the coffin. Cheongsan together with some of the disciples carried the coffin to the main sect from the bottom of the mountain. Muryeongjin looked at Cheongyeop\u2019s body in the coffin with a look of disbelief.\u201cCheongyeop!\u201dHis voice trembled.The old man had been practicing martial arts for such a long time that his heart had rarely been shaken, but now there\u2019s a throbbing pain in his chest.It felt like his heart was being torn apart.\u201cCheongyeop!\u201dMuryeongjin approached the coffin calling the name of Cheongyeop. He looked like he was about to collapse at any moment.\u201cSect leader!\u201d\u201cKheuk!\u201dThe Qingcheng sect warriors who saw the scene burst into tears.Muryeongjin approached Cheongyeop\u2019s body one step at a time with great difficulty. Cheongyeop had his eyes closed as if he was asleep. However, the scars left on his body were so disastrous that they couldn\u2019t bear to look.It was a trace of the Pyoseol Cheonunjang.Muryeongjin gently caressed Cheongyeop\u2019s body. At that moment, Cheongsan knelt down and put his head on the floor.\u201cPlease punish me for not guarding Cheongyeop well\u201d\u201cPlease punish me.\u201dThe warriors who had carried Cheongyeop\u2019s body with Cheongsan threw their heads down simultaneously. Their foreheads were bruised and blood splashed all over the place, but no one showed a dissatisfied expression.They were sinners.A felony who failed to protect a great disciple of the Qingcheng sect. They didn\u2019t even deserve to be hurt.Although they attacked the White Flower Room and caused great damage to the Emei, that did not erase their sins.Muryeongjin did not blame them. Because he knew that they did their best.\u201cSenior brother!\u201dThe Muhwajin approached the Muryeongjin. Without a word, he put his hand on the shoulder of Muryeongjin. That alone was a great comfort to the Muryeongjin.\u00a0Mu Iljin, also came to the side of Muryeongjin.Their faces were full of sorrow.No matter how deeply he studied the Tao and became detached from the material aspects of the world, he could not help but feel the pain over the deaths of his cherished disciples.That was then.Bang!Suddenly, a loud roar erupted from inside the Qingcheng sect.Muryeongjin and the others were startled and ran to the place where the explosion was heard.\u00a0It was the epicenter of the main hall where distinguished guests of the Qingcheng sect usually stayed.Mu Jeong-jin stood tall in the hall, and the men from the Thunder Gates were looking at him with a frightened expression.Unusual momentum was flowing from Mu Jeong-jin.With his force as violent as a storm, the men of Thunder Gates trembled all over like sheep meeting a lion.\u201cPriest! Why?\u201d\u201cSenior brother!\u201dMuryeongjin and Muhwajin called for Mu Jeong-jin. But Mu Jeong-jin only looked at the front without answering.Muryeongjin and Muhwajin, who followed the place where Mujeongjinin\u2019s gaze was directed, closed their eyes tightly without realizing it.\u201cOh Primordial God\u2026\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201dIn front of Mu Jeong-jin, there was a mutilated corpse.It didn\u2019t take long to find out that the body was Tae Yeon-ho, the sect leader of the Thunder Gates.\u201cWhy the hell did you do that?\u201d\u201cSenior brother! Why did you kill sect leader Tae?!\u201dThere was only one person in the Qingcheng sect who could kill Tae Yeon-ho, who is a sect leader, in a single shot.It was Mu Jeong-jin.In Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s eyes, there seemed to be a turbulent naturalization.He looked at Tae Yeon-ho\u2019s body and said,\u201cCheonyeop died because of him.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not because of sect leader Tae that Cheongyeop died.\u201d\u201cBut he was the cause.\u201d\u201cMu Jeong-jin!\u201d\u201cSenior brother. I will not let a single person involved in this matter live.\u201dCruel words came out of Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s mouth.\u00a0\u2018Huuu! The life of Mu Jeong-jin has reached its climax.\u2019After returning from the underground cave seven years ago, Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s life grew stronger and stronger. But no one knew why.He vaguely guessed that Mu Jeong-jin was suffering from a heart demon.\u00a0 The problem is that no one in the Qingcheng sect can control Mu Jeong-jin.Mu Jeong-jin was undoubtedly the most prominent member of the Qingcheng sect at this time.It would have to be at the level of Go Yeopjin, the oldest person in their sect, to be able to subdue him. However, the old man hid for a long time and did not appear.No one even knew whether he was still alive or staying on Mt. Qingcheng.\u201cCalm down, Mu Jeong-jin.\u201d\u201cCheongyeop is dead. How can I calm down?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s take a closer look at the overall situation. There must be a reason why the situation has worsened like this.\u201d\u201cCheonyeop lost his life because of the Emei sect. The scars on his body are clearly the Emei sect\u2019s Pyoseol Cheonunjang.\u201d\u201cBut\u2013\u201d\u201cSeven years ago, we lost Woo Gunsang because of them. And today, we lost Cheongyeop. The future of the Qingcheng sect has been shattered. And yet, you\u2019re asking me to endure it?\u201d\u201cJeong-jin.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t stand it. Senior brother told me to be patient, so I didn\u2019t come forward. I just watched them from the back. But what\u2019s the result?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t stop me, Senior brother! This time, I will get justice from the Emei sect. They will fear my name.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s still plenty of time. Calm down a little.\u201d\u201cNo, while we\u2019re muttering like this, those wicked Emei will prepare to strike us. We can no longer leave their provocations.\u201dSuddenly, Mu Jeong-jin kicked the ground and flew into the air. Then seven men also flew away after Mu Jeong-jin.It was the Qingcheng Seven Swords1\u00a0raised by Mu Jeong-jin himself.Mu Jeong-jin and the Qingcheng Seven Swords spread their qi and ran down the mountain without anyone stopping them.Muhwajin said with a worried expression.\u201cThis is a big deal. It would become even a bigger deal if Senior brother fetches Junior brother Woo.\u201d\u201cAre they going to meet Junior brother Woo? It\u2019s been over seven years since he lived there.\u201dJunior Brother Woo was Woo Jinpyeong, the father of Woo Gunsang.He was a genius who laid the foundation for the Qingcheng sect to leap forward, but since his son, Woo Gunsang, died, he has separated himself from the world.Mu Jeong-jin visited several times to invite him to the Qingcheng sect, but he was rejected every time. If only Woo Jinpyeong had been in the Qingcheng sect, they would have already put an end to the long war with the Emei sect.\u201cDoesn\u2019t everyone know? That if those two people really work together, there will be bloodshed in Sichuan.\u201d\u201cHuu\u2013\u201d\u201cWe must send someone to stop them. What we really want is for Emei to get down on their knees and apologize, not to destroy them.\u201d\u201cSenior brother is right. So who should we send down?\u201d\u201cI will go down the sect mountain myself.\u201d\u201cYou mean\u2026?\u201d\u201cThe causal relationship between the events is unclear. The series of events is developing too radically.\u201dMuhwajin had doubts about what was going on under the mountain. Someone had to go down the mountain to find out the truth.Muryeongjin let out a sigh.\u201cHuh! We can\u2019t help it. Take the martial artists of the Law Enforcement Hall2\u00a0down.\u201cThank you.\u201dThe Muhwajin man bowed his head deeply to Muryeongjin.The Law Enforcement Hall had the strongest force as it is the place in charge of managing the discipline of the Qingcheng sect.The head of the Law Enforcement Hall, Mu Yeongjin, was the second most advanced expert after Mujeongjin, and the warriros of the Law Enforcement Hall led by him possessed a force comparable to that of the Qingcheng Seven Swords.To have the Law Enforcement Hall join Muhwajin was like giving him all the rights.\u201cI will never let you down, Senior Brother!\u201d\u201cThe fate of the Qingcheng sect depends on you. And\u2026\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cWe also need to find out why Mu Jeong-jin is having a heart demon. If we let his heart demon grow like this, it might endanger the entire Sichuan Province.\u201d\u201cYes, Senior Brother!\u201dMuhwajin replied with a sad expression. The face of the Muryeongjin looking at him was full of concern.\u201cHow did things got to this point.\u201dHis sighs were scattered in the wind.* * *Pyo-wol returned to Chengdu.The atmosphere of Chengdu was still bloody. The streets were almost deserted, and most of the shops were closed. There were very few places that opened the door to guests.For that reason, Pyo-wol had to waste quite a bit of time trying to find an open guesthouse. However, his efforts were not in vain, since in the end, he was able to find a guest house.The owner of the guest house was desperate to make money even in such a bloody situation. The room costs twice as much as usual, and food, despite its poor quality, was sold at a higher price.Even if it was unfair, the guests had to endure the actions of the owner. This is because there are only a few guest houses where people can stay in Chengdu.The merchants who grabbed a room at a high price complained.\u201cThis is crazy! I have to pay five coins for a one-night stay in a guest house.\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t help it though. We can\u2019t stay homeless.\u201d\u201cDamn! What is going on with the Emei and Qingcheng sect? Why are we being involved?\u201d\u201cShh! Be quiet. And what if they hear you?\u201d\u201cWill the Emei and Qingcheng sect even come here?\u201d\u201cBe careful because there may be people around that related to them. Don\u2019t you know that birds hear daytime words and rats hear nighttime words?\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201dThe merchants lowered their voices, Pyo-wol could still hear them clearly.\u00a0He could not blame them, though.In a way, all of this happened because of him.If he had stayed still, there would have been no reason for the situation to have grown so much, and there would have been no reason for so many casualties.Still, he did not regret it.For him, the concept of good and evil had long since disappeared. Everything that interfered with his survival was evil, and everything that harmed him was absolute evil.Because he was forced to live in darkness for as many as fourteen years, his mentality became twisted from the very beginning.For fourteen years, his mind has been twisted and twisted. It can never be unraveled by ordinary means.Pyo-wol knew that too.That he was absolutely not normal.And he is greatly different from ordinary people.That said, he had no intention of changing himself. Because he didn\u2019t think that changing himself would change his destiny. He doesn\u2019t know where his fate will end, but he will run with all his might to the extent that he can reach it.\u00a0Even if he collapses in the middle with all his strength.\u201cHere\u2019s your meal.\u201dThe owner of the guest house served his meal. At first glance, the food looked unappealing. The owner of the guest house left the food on Pyo-wol\u2019s table and trudged into the kitchen.Pyo-wol took out a booklet from his pocket without even paying attention to the food.The characters, \u201cChengdu\u2019s Directory of Martial Artists,\u201d were clearly written on the cover.It was a booklet that was stolen by killing Oh San-kyung, the branch manager of Haomen.Pyo-wol did not have time to look through the list of martial artists of Chengdu, as he had been working between the Emei and Qingcheng sect. So this was his first time browsing Chengdu\u2019s Directory of Martial Artists.Chengdu\u2019s Directory of Martial Artists was literally a booklet in which Haomen compiled data on Chengdu\u2019s martial artists.\u00a0Haomun\u2019s intelligence network was so great that any warrior who set foot in Chengdu even once would have their identity recorded unconditionally.The name of Pyo-wol written on the first page was proof of that.Pyo-wol was not known to the public, and even though he had only been in Chengdu for a few days, he had already been identified and recorded in the booklet.Haomun\u2019s eyes and ears were proof that their influence spread throughout the city.Pyo-wol quietly handed over the Chengdu\u2019s Directory of Martial ArtistsParak! Pararak!A small smile appeared on Pyo-wol\u2019s lips as he read the booklet.The list of Chengdu\u2019s warriors was written in detail. It was not only about himself but also about the Black Cloud Mercenary Group.\u00a0[The Black Cloud Mercenary Group increases their power and forces by accepting cavalry.\u00a0They appear to be related to the foreign tribes, and they aim to establish a place within Sichuan.Captain\u00a0 Zhang Mu-ryang is quick to calculate and very ambitious.Special attention is required as it is a special skill to perform tightrope walking between both sides in a conflict zone.The place where the Black Cloud Mercenary Group entered is engulfed in conflict, to say the least. Beware of Go Dosa and Hyeol Seung.Go Dosa\u2026 ]Pyo-wol memorized the contents of Chengdu\u2019s Directory of Martial Artists in his head without missing a single word.In Jianghu, information has a precious value that cannot be exchanged for any other treasure. In particular, information obtained from groups like Haomen could not be obtained even with thousands of dollars.Although the title of the booklet was the Chengdu\u2019s Directory of Martial Artists, the contents not only covers the warriors of Chengdu but also the entire Sichuan Province.This is the end of volume 3.

    "Chapter 76": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 76Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe appearance of the gorgeous White Flower Room was nowhere to be found. This is because more than half of them were destroyed in the war with the Qingcheng sect.In this battle, Jeonghwa, the great disciple of Emei, and Geum Ha-ryun, the sect leader of the White Flower Room, lost their lives.Yong Seol-ran was the one who united both the Emei and White Flower Room\u2019s disciples who lost their focus. If she hadn\u2019t been on time, the White Flower Room would have completely collapsed in Chengdu.Yong Seol-ran commanded the disciples of the Emei sect and White Flower Room to restore the collapsed battle line and re-established the security line. Then, she sent people to clans that were friendly with the Emei sect, including the military officer, and asked for their cooperation.Thanks to her quick action, the White Flower Room was able to avoid the worst possible outcome.Zhang Mu-ryang, who was watching her, was amazed.\u201cYou\u2019re such a wonderful woman. It\u2019s strange how such a talented person has never been known.\u201d\u201cFrom what I know, they say that she is the best talent that the Emei group has had in 100 years. However, she is quiet and the great disciple Jeonghwa is keeping her in check, so she seems to have lived without revealing herself.\u201dAt the reply of Go Dosa, Zhang Mu-ryang laughed.\u201cNow that Jeonghwa is dead, she will show off her talents to her heart\u2019s content.\u201d\u201cYeah, you can see how talented she is by looking at the situation right now, can\u2019t you? She is very good at placing people in the right place and using them in the right place. If she becomes the sect leader, the Emei sect will be able to take another leap forward.\u201d\u201cHmm! Whoever possesses her might become the true master of the Emei sect.\u201d\u201cWhy are you greedy?\u201d\u201cFufu!\u201dInstead of answering, Zhang Mu-ryang gave a meaningful smile.Go Dosa also smiled.\u201cIf the captain can get her, it\u2019ll be a great loot. It\u2019ll make it easier to reach the captain\u2019s goal.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m worried. The wall around her heart seems pretty solid.\u201d\u201cThe more colorful roses, the more they hide sharp thorns, and unless you are prepared to get hurt to some extent, you can never break them.\u201d\u201cGo Dosa always tells me only good words to hear.\u201d\u201cAm I not always on your side?\u201d\u201cI hope that you will never change. And please take care of Ranju.\u201d\u201cWhy Ranju?\u201d\u201cThe circumstances are unfamiliar. Don\u2019t you know what the outcome will be if that child goes wild?\u201d\u201cAlright. I sn\u2019t handling her my specialty?\u201dZhang Mu-ryang nodded as if he liked Go Dosa\u2019s answer.That was then.Tuuung!Suddenly, an intense aura was felt outside.The complexion of the two changed.\u201cThis?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s strongl.\u201dWhoever the owner of the intense aura was made them feel the goosebumps. It was as if it\u2019s the energy benefiting of a sect leader.At that moment, the door opened and hundreds of disciples came out of the White Flower Room.At the center was an old woman reminiscent of a crow.An indescribable bizarre energy was emanating from her whole body as she stepped into the floor with her staff.The owner of the intense wave they felt was the old woman.Zhang Mu-ryang and Go Dosa quickly recognized the old woman\u2019s identity.\u201cIt seems that the Abbess of Nine Calamities came directly.\u201d\u201cHmm! The true owner of Emei is here.\u201dAs if to prove their words, the Emei and White Flower Room disciples all rushed out to meet the Guhwasata.\u201cThe disciples are here to greet the sect leader.\u201d\u201cWe sincerely welcome the visit of the sect leader.\u201dThe disciples of the two sects, regardless of who came first, knelt down on one knee to meet the Guhwasata.It was a sight to see how powerful the Abbess of Nine Calamities was.The whole White Flower Room froze at her appearance.Not only the students of the White Flower Room, but also the disciples of the Emei sect, who had already been there, could not even breathe calmly.The Abbess of Nine Calamities was not only the absolute leader of the Emei sect but also a powerful person who can cause a tremendous impact on the entire Sichuan Province.If it were just that, the disciples of the two factions would not have held their breath here.Everyone knows.How cruel the Abbess of Nine Calamities was. And what happens when someone gets in her eyes.The Abbess of Nine Calamities was not just a ruler, but a vicious leader.At least within the reach of the Emei sect, there was no one who could oppose her intentions.\u201cThe disciple sees the master.\u201d\u201cWoo Seonha of the White Flower Room warmly welcomes the visit of the sect leader.\u201dFinally, Yong Seol-ran and Woo Seonha faced the old woman. However, Guhwasata only looked at them with a cold expression.At the indifferent eyes that can\u2019t tell her thoughts, Seonha trembled.\u2018What kind of gaze\u2014\u2019She was not used to the gaze that seemed to see through her inside like this. The feeling of standing naked in front of the Abbess of Nine Calamities made her uneasy.It was a long time later that Guhwasata opened her mouth.\u201cLet\u2019s all go inside.\u201dShe entered Daejeon without hesitation as if she had come to her own house.Yong Seol-ran and Seonha followed, and those with higher ranks among the remaining disciples entered Daejeon.As Zhang Mu-ryang and Go Dosa were contemplating what to do, an unfamiliar voice reached their ears.\u2014 The two of you come inside too.It was the bellwether of Guhwasata.Zhang Mu-ryang and Go Dosa looked at each other\u2019s faces.\u201cDo you think we should go inside?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to, but we have no choice.\u201d\u201cGo inside first.\u201d\u201cOnly in times like this would you put this Go Dosa the lead.\u201d\u201cWhoops! I have to live a long, even a little bit more\u201d\u201cI want you to live long enough to lead the Black Clouds Mercenary Group well.\u201dThe two went into Daejeon exchanging meaningless jokes.The Abbess of Nine Calamities was sitting in the most splendid Taesa Temple in Daejeon. To the left and right of her were the disciples of the Emei and White Flower Room.There were a lot of people in the big Daejeon, but not a single one of them could even breathe loudly so they could only watch Guhwasata.Zhang Mu-ryang and Go Dosa looked at them moderately, and snuggled into the back seat.This is because when the atmosphere is not good, they did not want to come to the front and received the anger of Guhwasata. Guhwasata looked at Yong Seol-ran with her legs crossed.\u201cTell me, what happened\u2013\u201dShe already knew the full story of the incident from the letter Yong Seol-ran sent, but Guhwasata again demanded an explanation in front of everyone.Knowing how tenacious the master\u2019s temper is, Yong Seolr-an told everything she knew from start to finish.Guhwasata closed her eyes and listened to Yong Seol-ran\u2019s voice. At Yong Seol-ran\u2019s attitude, as if she would not miss a single word, the Emei sect\u2019s disciples once again put on a tense expression on their faces.However, Yong Seol-ran\u2019s expression did not change even once as she reported directly.They don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because Yong Seol-ran has a bold personality from the beginning, or because she\u2019s not afraid of her master, but Zhang Mu-ryang once again admired the way she spoke calmly without being nervous.He already had a desire to have Yong Seol-ran, but seeing her like this made him even more greedy.\u201c\u2026that\u2019s how it happened.\u201dAfter a long time, the words of Yong Seol-ran have finally come to an end.Up to that time, Guhwasata did not open her closed eyes.Yong Seol-ran looked at her master like that quietly. Now all she has to do is finish. It was the judgment of the rest of tGuhwasata and the decision that followed.It was only after a while that Guhwasata opened her mouth.\u201cSo, it all started when Nam Ho-san, the young master of the Thunder Gates, was killed by an assassin. Did that assassin master the Qingcheng sect\u2019s Seventy-Two Sword Waves?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cAnd are you sure that assassin is the assassin who caused theincident 7 years ago?\u201d\u201cAs far as I know so far, yes.\u201d\u201cWe were thoroughly played by one assassin. Did you say his name is Pyo-wol?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cPyo-wol, Pyo\u2026wol!\u201dGuhwasata recalled Pyo-wol\u2019s name. Her mouth was dry as if she was chewing a grain of sand.At that moment, Guhwasata\u2019s eyes shone sharply.Immediately after hearing the name Pyo-wol, she noticed the change in the expression on Seolha\u2019s face. She tried hard to keep a calm expression, but her emotions already caught the eye of Guhwasata.\u201cSeolha!\u201d\u201cYe, yes!\u201dIn response to the sudden call from Guhwasata, Seonha quickly answered.Guhwasata looked straight at Seolha\u201cDo you have anything to say?\u201d\u201cYes? What?\u201dShe showed a perplexed expression but the eyes of Guhwasata which stared at her seemed to see through her. Guhwasata did not miss the reaction of Seolha\u201cPyo-wol.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s your relationship with him?\u201d\u201cThat, what do you mean? Me, I\u2019m related to Pyo-wol?\u201d\u201cSeolha.\u201dGuhwasata called Seolha\u2019s name and stood up. She approached Seolha.Thud! Thud!The sound of her footsteps together with her staff hitting the floor was particularly loud. Seolha\u2019s heart was also pounding heavily.Finally, Guhwasata reached the front of Seolha, spoke.\u201cLook straight into my eyes.\u201d\u201cCome on, sect leader! I, I-\u201dSeolha was visibly embarrassed. With her appearance, others also thought that she was trying to hide something.Seolha couldn\u2019t look straight into the eyes of Guhwasata. It was because her eyes were scary and there were things that bothered her.Kwaaac!At that moment, Guhwasata reached out and grabbed Seolha\u2019s chin. She forced Seolha to meet her eyes.\u201cHeuk!\u201dUnable to overcome the pressure, Seolha let out a rough breath. Guhwasata looked at Seolha and continued.\u201cI don\u2019t like people close to me lying. What\u2019s your relationship with Pyo-wol? Why are you so agitated when his name comes up?\u201d\u201cThat, that\u2026\u201dSeolha couldn\u2019t stand the pressure any longer.She possessed an outstanding beauty that stole the hearts of many drunken men, but her heart was not strong enough to withstand the pressure of the Guhwasata.In the end, she burst into tears and opened her mouth.\u201cActually\u2014\u201dShe confided everything that happened with Pyo-wol.The first meeting with Pyo-wol, her relationship with him, and even asking for the assassination of Nam Ho-san, the young master of the Thunder Gates.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I really didn\u2019t know it was going to get this far.\u201dSeolha\u2019s face was all stained with tears.One of the most beautiful women in Chengdu was crying, but no one came forward to comfort her. It was clear that if someone went out to protect Seolha, they would completely receive the anger of Guhwasata.Seolha was trembling.She really didn\u2019t know that the man she was trying to take advantage of would be capable of causing all this mess.Because of him, one of the Emei sect\u2019s great disciples, her aunt Jeonghwa, and even Geum Ha-ryun, her master, lost their lives. Although she was not directly responsible for their deaths, she could not escape the accusations that they would throw at her because of her relationship with Pyo-wol.Seolha got down on her knees and said.\u201cI\u2019ll take care of all of this. Just give me a few people and I\u2019ll catch him. He trusts me, so he\u2019ll just fall into my trap.\u201d\u201cWeren\u2019t you listening? Do you think he\u2019ll fall into your trap? He\u2019s a snake.\u201dGuhwasata clicked her tongue.If he had been captured by Seonha, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to get away with making fun of the Emei and the Qingcheng sect 7 years ago.Because of that one person, the Emei and the Qingcheng became rivals, and they have been fighting each other ever since.There was no way that a man like Pyo-wol would ever be caught in the trap made by Seolha. His relationship with her was nothing more than a tool for him to go ahead with his plans. That assassin is not capable of giving a woman any feelings.Guhwasata reached out and stroked Seolha\u2019s head.\u201cSeolha. You ugly thing.\u201d\u201cSect\u2026 leader!\u201d\u201cWho told you to kill the young master of the Thunder gates?\u201d\u201cBut he threatened me. If I don\u2019t marry him, I\u2019ll be on the side of the Qingcheng sect, so I couldn\u2019t do it\u2014 Anyway, what I did was purely for the Emei sect and White Flower Room\u201d\u201cYou should have done what you normally do, to dazzle the men. That was your role.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that hard. You just needed to do it as you usually do.\u201d\u201cOh, please forgive me.\u201dSeolha felt an unusual atmosphere and knelt down. However, Guhwasata\u2019s eyes who was looking at her were unbearably cold.Yong Seol-ran, who was next to them, also sensed the unusual atmosphere and tried to move forward.\u201cMaster! She is\u2014\u201dPouck!At that moment, a fountain of blood spurted from the top of Seolha\u2019s head.Guhwasata struck Seolha with the palm of her hand. Seolha\u2019s skull was smashed and her brain was crushed like tofu.Seolha looked at the situation with a look of disbelief.\u201cI\u2014\u201dShe couldn\u2019t finish her words and collapsed.It was the vain death of Seolha, who was called the most beautiful woman in the city.Guhwasata muttered as she wiped the blood from her palms.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have even thought about it.\u201dThe atmosphere in the hall froze in an instant.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Yong Seol-ran\u2019s clothes were puffed up, and her dark hair rose towards the sky like seaweed.Kwarr!The area trembled as if it was about to collapse. Yong Seol-ran stared at the situation with anger-filled eyes.At the sight of Yong Seol-ran getting angry for the first time, the disciples of the Emei sect were astonished. The strong pressure coming from Yong Seol-ran was not far behind in power with the Abbess of Nine Calamities.\u2018Oh my God!\u2019\u2018Seol-ran already has reached this level?\u2019The Emei sect\u2019s great disciples could not help but be astonished. It was known early on that Yong Seol-ran had great talent. However, they didn\u2019t expect her to have reached this level because she was usually quiet and didn\u2019t show her prowess.A smile crept on the corner of Guhwasata\u2019s lips.\u201cSeol-ran!\u201d\u201cThere was no need to do that. She didn\u2019t do it on purpose\u2014\u201dYong Seol-ran\u2019s rage exploded.Seolha\u2019s death made her reveal her growth she had been working so hard to hide. Yong Seol-ran could not tolerate the behavior of Guhwasata, who only thought of people as tools.Even when Guhwasata saw Yong Seol-ran opposing herself, Guhwasata didn\u2019t stop smiling. Because it was the look she had always wanted for Yong Seol-ran to have.Yong Seol-ran has always concealed itself. One reason was because of the influence of Jeonghwa, who always kept her in check.\u00a0But above all, she did not want to be taken advantage of by Guhwasata.If she thoroughly humbled herself and stayed hidden, Guhwasata could not make use of her. However this time, since she could not hold back her anger and showed off her skills, this gives Guhwasata enough reason to make sure of her.Yong Seol-ran knew that too. But this time, she couldn\u2019t stand it.\u201cNo matter how wrong she is, you can\u2019t kill her like this.\u201d\u201cIf you have committed a mortal sin, you must die.\u201d\u201cMaster!\u201d\u201cSeol-ran, you should also know that once you start making exceptions once or twice, there won\u2019t be an end to it. You won\u2019t understand what I\u2019m saying now. But someday, when you rise to the top, you\u2019ll understand why I did what I did today. So stop rebelling and go back to your seat.\u201d\u201cMaster!\u201d\u201cCome on!\u201dYong Seol-ran bit her lip at the voice of Guhwasata, which sounded like a crow howling.Now she definitely understood. No matter what she said, the old woman in front of her would never listen.\u00a0Each person is different, but her master had a particularly harsh standard of looking at people. There was no mercy for those who did not meet the standards of the Abbess of Nine Calamities.The same was the case with Seolha, the young mistress of the White Flower Room.Guhwasata used this situation to intimidate the disciples of the Emei sect and the White Flower Room. Knowing that there are many people who have been used and abandoned like Seolha, Yong Seol-ran drew the line between her and Guhwasata.If Woo Gunsang had not been killed by Pyo-wol seven years ago, she too would have been reduced to a mere tool to be used. Yong Seol-ran clenched her teeth and returned to her seat.Guhwasata smiled with satisfaction. But that was only for a moment before she looked at the disciples with cold eyes and said,\u201cFirst, get rid of this bitch\u2019s body.\u201dWhere she pointed, Seolha\u2019s body was spread out.\u201cHeuc!\u201d\u201cYoung mistress!\u201dThe disciples in the White Flower Room moved the body of Seolha, swallowing their tears. A bewildered expression appeared on the faces of the disciples of the White Flower Room, who suddenly lost their sect leader and young mistress.Guhwasata told them.\u201cAnyway, the White Flower Room is a branch from the same root as the Emei sect. I\u2019ll lead you guys back.\u201dNo one dared to defy the orders of Guhwasata. They were afraid that they would end up in the same situation.\u00a0Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s eyes deepened.\u2018There is no other fox with nine tails.\u2019Guhwasata took over the atmosphere of the hall in an instant. Even if it had not been revealed that Seolha had done anything wrong, Guhwasata would have killed her by coming up with any excuse. It is only then that the White Flower Room can be completely subjugated.It might have looked like she had accidentally killed Seolha in an emotional outburst, but there was a meticulous calculation behind it.\u2018This is going to be harder than I thought.\u2019The outstanding appearance of Guhwasata made it more difficult.\u00a0 Guhwasata was in no way weak. Along with the Qingcheng sect\u2019s Mu Jeong-jin, Guhwasata could be said to be the strongest in Sichuan. Guhwasata was the most difficult opponent that Zhang Mu-ryang had ever met.At that time, Guhwasata spoke to Zhang Mu-ryang.\u201cCaptain Zhang.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cYou have to move.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI hope for the Black Cloud Mercenary Group to hunt Pyo-wol.\u201d\u201cAre you saying we\u2019re the only ones who\u2019re going to catch the\u00a0 assassin?\u201d\u201cJust because of that one assassin, the White Flower Room and the main sect suffered a lot of damage. In addition, the relationship between the Qingcheng sect was irreparably damaged.\u201dGuhwasata\u2019s eyes were shining eerily. Her words continued.\u201cIf we let him go wild like this, he\u2019ll cause a lot of damage before we even fight against the Qingcheng sect, so we have to get rid of him before that. In a way, dealing and catching him was more urgent than the Qingcheng sect.\u201d\u201cHmm! Three hundred and fifty men of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group are moving to catch one assassin? It seems like a business that doesn\u2019t fit the bill?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll make sure the Black Cloud Mercenary Group is located near Chengdu, not outside of Sichuan.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll also stop any sect in Sichuan from daring to bet on other things. And I\u2019ll also give you a new foreign trade right. How is it? Wouldn\u2019t this be appropriate enough?\u201cHaha! There\u2019s really no reason to refuse this. Could you write it down, please?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll write it.\u201dGuhwasata happily answered.\u00a0There was a deep trough in Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s forehead. He found it strange that Guhwasata easily agreed to the terms and conditions.Zhang Mu-ryang looked at Go Dosa. Go Dosa nodded. His gesture meant that they should accept the offer.\u2014This is a golden opportunity to lay our foundation in Sichuan. If we miss it, an opportunity like this will never come again.It was an urgent time so Go Dosa sent him a message.Zhang Mu-ryang made his decision.\u201cOkay. Pyo-wol. We\u2019ll definitely capture him. So you\u2019ll have to keep your promise.\u201d\u201cI promise under the honor of the sect leader of the Emei sect. Bring me the head of Pyo-wol.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dWhen Zhang Mu-ryang answered, Guhwasata immediately wrote down the promise in writing. Guhwasata wrote without hesitation.Zhang Mu-ryang cherished the documents written by Guhwasata in his arms.With this document alone, it was possible for them to take root in Sichuan. Once they took root, they had the confidence to raise the Black Cloud Mercenary Group no less than any other clan in Sichuan Province.Moreover, they even obtained a new foreign trade zone. It was like digging a gold bars in the open air.At that time, Guhwasata poured cold water.\u201cI don\u2019t think you should like it too much. If you don\u2019t manage to bring Pyo-wol\u2019s head to me, that whole document will be invalid.\u201d\u201cThat will never happen.\u201d\u201cYou look confident.\u201d\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be able to imagine. What kind of work we\u2019ve been doing. What other things we can do.\u201d\u201cCan words do anything? I don\u2019t believe in talkative humans.\u201d\u201cFufu! I\u2019ll show you the results.\u201dZhang Mu-ryang got up. There was no reason to be here after receiving the reward documents.Zhang Mu-ryang went out with Go Dosa. As the two disappeared, a disciple carefully said to Guhwasata.\u201cCan we trust them?\u201d\u201cHow can I bear to trust a mercenary in one day? Trust is not important. His ambition is what matters.\u201d\u201cAmbition?\u201d\u201cYes. He needs a justification to settle in the Sichuan Province. Once settled, it\u2019s his ambition to attract more mercenaries and build a sect that no one can beat.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it more dangerous then? If we bring such a dangerous person into Sichuan, we will be in trouble forever.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, isn\u2019t it? If the Black Cloud Mercenary Group can really put their beaks down on Sichuan.\u201dGuhwasata gave a meaningful smile.* * *Seolha\u2019s body was piled up and dumped on the outskirts of the city.Yasan was a place where unrelated people among the people of Chengdu were thrown away.At least if the White Flower Room was still alive.The White Flower Room completely belonged to the Emei sect, and the Guhwasata treated Seolha as a criminal who sold the Emei sect Under such circumstances, it was impossible for the disciples of the White Flower Room to build her a grave with an altar.\u201cHik!\u201dThey returned to Chengdu in tears.Krrr!A herd of wild dogs was the first to smell the corpse and approached. The wild dogs drooled with their noses stuck. It was when the head wild dog opened its mouth and was about to pluck Seolha\u2019s body.Pouck!A stone flew from somewhere and smashed the head of the wild dog. The startled wild dogs looked in the direction the stone was flying and became cautious.Then a man appeared from the darkness.The man in the splendid robe was Pyo-wol.When Pyo-wol appeared, the wild dogs were confused and ran away. This is because they instinctively felt that Pyo-Wol was a different being from them.Pyo-wol moved towards the bulwark where Seolha\u2019s body was contained.When he lifted up the coffin, he saw the dead body of Seolha, with her head broken and in a miserable state.Pyo-wol hugged Seolha\u2019s body.He didn\u2019t feel sorry for her since they were in a situation where they had used each other. Still, he thought that the body should be buried in the right place.Pyo-wol moved Seola\u2019s body to a sunny place. He dug the ground himself and buried her body nicely. They couldn\u2019t even make a burial mound for fear of the tomb being found by the Emei sect.Pyo-wol sat by the tomb and looked at Chengdu.Chengdu was like a blast bomb on the verge of an explosion.The battle between the Emei sect and the Qingcheng sect made it so. However, it was Pyo-wol that induced and created such a situation.As Pyo-wol promotes a crisis between the two factions, all the other factions in Chengdu and Sichuan are split into two sides and are about to face an extreme confrontation.Many people have died so far, but more people will die in the future. Still, Pyo-wol did not regret his actions.He couldn\u2019t even imagine turning back now.Whatever the outcome, he had to go to the end.Even if the end is his own death.Pyo-wol lay on the side of the grave and looked up at the sky.The blue sky caught his eye. It was a landscape he could not even imagine when he was in the underground cave.Pyo-wol murmured with the sky right in front of his eyes.\u201cI won\u2019t say I\u2019m sorry, we\u2019ve been using each other anyway. But I\u2019ll make sure you get revenge. She\u2019s going to suffer more than you did.\u201dPyo-wol lay still for a long time and did not move.It was after the sun had set over Seosan Mountain that he got up. He came down the hill through the darkness where he could not see an inch ahead.Pyo-wol took a step towards Chengdu. The road to Chengdu was quiet. Thanks to this, he was able to be free from public gaze, but Pyo-wol half-covered his face with a scarf.In a sense, he was now a celebrity.His handsome face attracted people\u2019s attention. He could move freely when his identity back then was not known, but now he can\u2019t.The Qingcheng sect may not know him, but the Emei sect will now know for sure who he is.The death of Seolha proved that fact.To some extent, that was also the intention of Pyo-wol. He could have done his assassinaion without revealing his identity, but in that case, the fear felt by the opponent would be halved.That was the reason Pyo-wol deliberately leaked his identity.If it weren\u2019t for that reason, it would have taken them much longer to figure out the identity of Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol quietly entered Chengdu.There was a guest house booked in advance on the outskirts of Chengdu. He went inside the guest house, but no one paid any attention to him. Even though his face was half-covered with a scarf.Most people were indifferent to the affairs of others. It was the same for those in the guest house. People were busy chatting and talking about what happened in Chengdu today.\u201cThe Abbess of Nine Calamities has entered Chengdu?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m telling you! As soon as she entered the White Flower Room, she killed Young Miss Seolha in a single shot.\u201d\u201cNo, why Young Miss Seolha?\u201d\u201cWho knows? You too, be careful. If you get on the Emei sect\u2019s nerves by mistake, you might end up like that.\u201d\u201cHik! They\u2019re scary.\u201dThe man trembled as if he was terrified just by imagining it.Pyo-wol sat down and listened to their stories.Even the smallest details could be important information to him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Bang!Early in the morning there was a hand knocking on the tightly closed door. The owner of the hand was an old swordsman with a thick beard. Dozens of young warriors also stood behind the old swordsman\u2019s back.The door did not open even after they knocked for a while, and the warriors were tired of waiting. However, the old swordsman kept knocking on the door without making a single distasteful expression.Eventually, the door opened, probably tired of the old swordsman\u2019s persistence.It was an old man as old as the old swordsman who opened the door and poked his head out.The old man was dazzled.\u201cHey! I heard you knocked on the door like that in the morning, and Muhwajin came.\u201d\u201cHow are you, Go Chongwan? You look a lot older.\u201d\u201cHow can you stop the passing of time? But did you come here for business?\u201dAn old man called Go Chongwan asked cautiously.It was not common for Muhwajin to come down from Mt. Qingcheng. The fact that he came down the mountain to visit this place also meant that something great had happened.\u201cSenior Brother Woo. Is he inside?\u201d\u201cHe may be there, but\u2026\u201d\u201cGo and tell him that I\u2019m here. I know it\u2019s heartbreaking, but now the Qingcheng sect is in crisis, and we need the help of the Senior Brother Woo.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cJust tell him that.\u201d\u201cOkay. Wait a minute.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting for you.\u201dAt Muhwajin\u2019s words, Go Chongwan closed the door and ran to Daecheong.Muhwajin, who was left outside the door, looked at the signboard above the front door with a bitter expression.The four letters on the signboard were dimly visible. It looked like it was not taken care of at all. Not only the signboard, but also the crumbling wall and the lush branches protruding from it showed how neglected this place was.Not only the signboard, but also the crumbling wall windows and the protruding branches from above showed how neglected this place was.An old man of a similar age approached Muhwajin.He was one of the junior brothers of Muhwajin and the head of the Law Enforcement Hall, Mu Young.Mu Young opened his mouth with a sad expression.\u201cIt must have been very heartbreaking for Senior Brother Woo.\u201d\u201cHow could it not be? We were disciples, but to him he was his only one flesh and blood. How can our sorrow compare to him?\u201d\u201cThe death of Woo Gunsang was a shock to everyone. Who would have known that an assassin would break into our sect and assassinate our best talent?\u201d\u201cHuu! Because of that, our sects wings were broken.\u201dMuhwajin took a deep breath.After the assassination of Woo Gunsang, the best talent of the Qingcheng faction, seven years ago, Woo Jinpyeong, who was heartbroken, left everything and went down to his hometown to live.He was not involved in the affairs of his family, let alone the Qingcheng sect.They tried to persuade him to return to the Qingcheng sect several times, but to no avail. Woo Jinpyeong stayed with his ears closed and his eyes closed.Now, seven years have passed, and most of the family members have left, leaving only a few servants, including Go Chongwan, to protect him.The momentum of the Qingcheng sect, which was as high as the sky before Woo Jinpyeong left the house, was also weakened.It was widely believed that if Woo Jinpyeong had maintained his position, the conflict with the Emei sect would have ended sooner. But such a great talent had been living in the sorrow of losing his child for seven years.\u00a0So today, Muhwajin had to convince him to come back into the world.He might be unwilling, but someone has to do it.Muhwajin and Mu Young stood and waited for a long time. However, Go Chongwan did not appear.At this point, some people might complain, but no one showed a distasteful expression. This is because he deeply understands Woo Jinpyeong\u2019s plight.Kkiiic!After a while, the door opened and an old man with long hair appeared. The moment they saw him, tears welled up in their eyes.\u201cSenior brother!\u201d\u201cCome here, brother!\u201d\u201cHow have you been? Senior brother! I\u2019m so sorry for not seeing you often.\u201d\u201cAs you can see, I\u2019m living a good life. So brother Mu Young also came.\u201dWoo Jinpyeong also greeted Mu Young.\u201cSenior brother!\u201dMu Young hugged Woo Jinpyeong and could not speak for a while. It was because Woo Jinpyeong\u2019s slanted appearance broke his heart.At that time, the people of the Law Enforcement Hall all took the initiative and greeted Woo Jinpyeong simultaneously.\u201cThe disciples see Saba Woo.\u201d\u201cYeah! You guys are here too. Let\u2019s all go inside.\u201dWoo Jinpyeong brought all the people into his house.The condition inside of the house was much more serious than it looked from the outside.Most of the pavilions were half-collapsed and overgrown with weeds. Only the pavilion where Woo Jinpyeong and Go Chongwan lived were in good shape.The warriors of the Qingcheng sect were at a loss for words at the disastrous appearance of the house.\u00a0Muhwajin sighed and said,\u201cHuu! I\u2019m sorry. Please feel free to curse this insensitive brother who has never come to visit. I really didn\u2019t expect that my Senior Brother was going to leave everything like this.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have any children to pass on, so what am I going to do with this extra wealth? It\u2019s all useless. I\u2019m happy enough as it is.\u201d\u201cSenior brother!\u201d\u201cBut what\u2019s going on here?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t Senior Brother Mu Jeong-jin also come here?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t even see the face of Senior Brother Mu Jeong-jin. What do you mean by the crisis the Qingcheng sect is facing?\u201d\u201cUm! Actually\u2026\u201dMuhwajin told Woo Jinpyeong what had happened in the past. Woo Jinpyeong closed his eyes and listened to Muhwajin. Finally, when the Muhwajin had finished speaking, Woo Jinpyeong opened his eyes and said,\u201cIt must have been a third party intervention.\u201d\u201cWhy do you think so?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because the timing is all convoluted. The young master of the Thunder Gates was assassinated by the Seventy-Two Sword Waves\u2026\u201dWoo Jinpyeong suddenly trembled as if he had been struck by lightning.\u201cWhat is it, Senior Brother?\u201d\u201cMy God! The Seventy-Two Sword Waves!\u201dWoo Jinpyeong closed his eyes.The sword technique which killed his son, Woo Gunsang, was the Seventy-Two Waves. He didn\u2019t know it at the time when Gunsang died, but after looking closely, he found out that it was a wound caused by the Seventy-Two Swords Waves.\u201cDidn\u2019t the assassin who killed Gunsang in the past learned the Seventy-Two Swords Waves?\u201d\u201cBut wasn\u2019t he killed by Senior Brother Mu Jeong-jin?\u201d\u201cThe assassin was just thrown into a snake pit, but Senior Brother didn\u2019t kill him himself.\u201d\u201cDoes Senior Brother think that that assassin has come back to life?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t there a possibility?\u201dWoo Jinpyeong\u2019s eyes shone eerily.At Woo Jinpyeong\u2019s eyes, which they had never seen before, Muhwajin and Mu Young felt the chills.\u00a0Muhwajin asked cautiously.\u201cWhat if he was really the assassin of that time?\u201d\u201cOf course, we have to take revenge for our children, isn\u2019t it the responsibility of the rest of us to relieve the pain of the children who went before their parents?\u201dFor the first time, Woo Jinpyeong\u2019s face began to glow.* * *Seuk! Seuk!Pyo-wol honed the ghost knife on the whetstone.The blade was damaged in several places over time because he had been using it harshly. It was best to leave it to Tang Sochu for a proper repair, but as a temporary measure, he was doing it himself.Every time Pyo-wol moved his hand, the ghost knife regained its original sharpness. It was sharp enough to cut the skin with just a slight touch of his hand.Pyo-wol placed all the ten ghost knives on his belt.After squatting for a long time, his back and legs were numb. Pyo-wol patted his waist and legs with his fist and looked around. There was no one around the well where he was grinding the whetstone.Pyo-wol pulled out the Soul-Reaping Thread on his hand. The thread made of invisible qi was stretched long.Now, pulling out and maintaining a single thread was not very difficult. That\u2019s because he already got the knack of it.\u201cThen maybe two?\u201dPyo-wol pulled out an extra stalk of Soul-Reaping Thread. It was not difficult to pull out one more stem as his skill increased, but it was not easy to maintain it because of the enormous energy consumption.Beads of sweat ran down Pyo-wol\u2019s forehead. Drops of sweat ran into his eyes making him felt a sting, but Pyo-wol did not lose his concentration.Pyo-wol did everything in his power to maintain the two lines of the Soul-Reaping Thread. After much concentration, the two\u00a0 Soul-Reaping Threads found stability. But Pyo-wol was not satisfied with this level.Now, he had to freely use the two lines of Soul-Reaping Threads.Suiic!Pyo-wol wielded the Soul-Reaping Threads and swung it towards a vacant lot near the well.The Soul-Reaping Threads pierced the air sharply and showed off its tremendous power. But Pyo-wol never intended to be this satisfied.While the Soul-Reaping Threads was extended out of his hand, he digs into his waist, and pulled out the ghost knives. Two ghost knives were hung on each Soul-Reaping Thread.Ciiit!As the ghost rain was attached, the power of the Soul-Reaping Thread was maximized. Pyo-wol treated the two ghost knives like his limbs.\u00a0After a long time, Pyo-wol collected the ghost knives. As the ghost knives hid behind his belt, the Soul-Reaping Thread disappeared naturally.Pyo-wol\u2019s whole body was drenched with sweat. Still, Pyo-wol looked dissatisfied. Because he thought his growth was too slow. His goal was to use the ten ghosts at will by using the Soul-Reaping Thread. Two isn\u2019t enough.Pyo-wol shook his head and returned to the well.He drew water from the well and put it on his head. A cold stream of water wet his clothes and his body. Pyo-wol ran the well several times to wash away his sweat.Pyo-wol put down the headboard and operated his internal energy.Chiiiic!Instantly, the water that was soaking his body and clothes turned into steam and flew away. Pyo-wol, who was in a comfortable state in an instant, left the well.As he left the well, Pyo-wol covered the lower part of his face with a scarf. That didn\u2019t completely hide his handsome looks, but he was able to block people\u2019s eyes to some extent.The atmosphere inside Chengdu was horrendous.This is because not only the disciples of the Qingcheng sect and the Emei sect, but also many of the clans representing Sichuan Province dispatched their troops.Not only the clans based in Chengdu, such as Golden Gate or Qing Ming Room, but also numerous warriors from the outside are roaming the Chengdu. Some of them were warriros directly related to the Qingcheng and Emei sects, and some were not.There was a light of tension and excitement visible on their faces.The full-scale war between the Emei sect\u00a0 and Qingcheng sect was the first major event since the incident seven years ago, when former warriors of Sichuan came together to subdue assassins by spreading their inescapable net.Whoever wins, the power structure within Sichuan will change drastically.Of course, the warriors connected to the Qingcheng sect will fight for the victory of the Qingcheng sect. They will cry, and so will those who are connected with the Emei sect. But not everyone was like that.There were also those who wanted to stay in the middle, or to show off their prestige in this opportunity.With such a crowd, Chengdu became the center of the storm.Because the atmosphere was so ferocious as the martial artists, ordinary people just stopped going out of their houses.Pyo-wol headed to the guest house right in front of the White Flower Room.\u201cWelcome.\u201dWhen Pyo-wol came in, a waiter ran to meet him. He has been staying here for several days already, so the waiter knows him.\u201cGuide me to a seat facing the window.\u201d\u201cFollow me.\u201dThe waiter gladly guided Pyo-wol to the best seat. It was still early, so the guest house was empty.After ordering a simple meal, Pyo-wol sat down at the seat with the best view of the White Flower Room.Unfamiliar people stood guard at the front door of the White Flower Room. Pyo-wol found out that they were the main disciples of the Emei sect.He spent several days here, observing the White Flower Room. Thanks to this, he was able to remember most of the faces of the new Emei sect disciples. Everything from their body shapes, faces, voices, and even the hierarchical relationship between them.Tak!The food was placed on the table where he was sitting. But it wasn\u2019t the waiter who laid down his ordered food.\u201cHello there, handsome oraboni.\u201dIt was Heo Ran-ju who put the food down instead of the waiter. Heo Ran-ju, who put down his food, sat down across from Pyo-wol and said,\u201cThe food here looks delicious. Come on, eat it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAh! Maybe you think I poisoned the food? I don\u2019t do such obscene things, so eat with confidence.\u201dHeo Ran-ju clasped her chin on her arms and smiled softly. Without taking a bite of the food,Pyo-wol asked Heo Ran-ju,\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean? I\u2019m here to see handsome oraboni.\u201d\u201cFor what reason?\u201d\u201cBecause I want to see you.\u201dHeo Ran-ju smiled more deeply and stretched out her white fingers. Her fingers touched the scarf that covered Pyo-wol\u2019s face. Heo Ran-ju slowly lowered Pyo-wol\u2019s scarf. Then Pyo-wol\u2019s face was completely revealed.\u201cYou\u2019re handsome. So why are you covering your face like this?\u201d\u201cAre you here to see my face?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s one reason, and there are other reasons\u2026 But it\u2019s nice to see your face like this. It\u2019s always nice to see a handsome man.\u201dHeo Ran-ju smiled as if she was in a really good mood. However, Pyo-wol was not naive enough to be deceived by her appearance.Heo Ran-ju pressed her face close to Pyo-wol\u2019s. And she continued,\u201cDo you know how hard it was to find you? Who would have expected you to watch the White Flower Room under our nose like this? Clever, really clever.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re looking for me?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cOur captain has received a commission.\u201d\u201cIf I ask you what it is, will you answer my question?\u201d\u201cOf course. You have to know how things work.\u201d\u201cTell me. What kind of request is it?\u201d\u201cA request to kill you.\u201dHeo Ran-ju answered with a bright expression on her face. Pyo-wol did not change his expression at all even after hearing her words. Then, Heo Ran-ju tilted her head.\u201cAren\u2019t you surprised?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m surprised enough.\u201d\u201cYeah? I thought you weren\u2019t surprised, so I was almost disappointed.\u201dHeo Ran-ju rolled her big eyes. It looked like she was showing affection to her lover, but Heo Ran-ju\u2019s eyes were not smiling at all.Heo Ran-ju was staring at Pyo-wol with cold eyes.\u201cPyo-wol.\u201d\u201cSay it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll tell you one last time. Join the Black Cloud Mercenary Group. Then I\u2019ll cancel this request.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This is the only way.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019d better think well, handsome oraboni. If you decline our offer again this time, you won\u2019t get an opportunity like this again. I sincerely hope that oraboni will accept our offer, and I will get to look at that handsome face for the rest of my life. It\u2019s a waste to see such a handsome face go.\u201dThud!Then, with a dull sound, a large monk appeared behind Pyo-wol. He was Hyeol Seung who always stuck with Heo Ran-ju.Hyeol Seung joined them and said,\u201cAmitabha Buddha! I hope that you will accept Ranju\u2019s proposal.\u201dThe words were polite, but the energy or content contained within them was absolutely not. A strong force was oozing out from the whole body of the Hyeol Seung.Then another voice was heard.\u201cDamn it! Stop with your momentum. Are we here to kill? Why are you staring at him so ferociously?\u201dIt was Go Dosa who appeared with a tap on the shoulder of Hyeol Seung. Go Dosa approached Pyo-wol with a peculiar gait.\u201cLong time no see. You seem to have gotten even more handsome. Damn it! What an enviable life. How does it feel to live in the world with that kind of face?\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see your face because you\u2019ve been working so diligently. Anyway, it\u2019s amazing. You\u2019re deepening the rift between the Emei sect and Qingcheng sect. Thanks to that, we\u2019re the only ones playing.\u201dGo Dosa slumped down on the seat next to Heo Ran-ju. Heo Ran-ju\u2019s eyebrows twitched as if she didn\u2019t like it, but she didn\u2019t say anything.Go Dosa looked at Pyo-wol with a smirk on his face.\u201cRanju is also desperately looking for you, so why not just join hands with us?\u201cYou said you received a request from the Emei sect? Can you withdraw it so easily?\u201d\u201cWhat else can we not do? We can lie to them saying that we killed you properly and then fix it later. By the time the Emei sect finds out about it, we will already have a firm place in Sichuan Province.\u201d\u201cIs it okay to betray a client like that? If you\u2019re a mercenary, isn\u2019t trust the most important thing?\u201d\u201cHeh heh! Who in today\u2019s world would keep such a banal thing? As you know, the most important thing in the world is money. Only the value of money will not change.\u201dGo Dosa pretended to touch the money with his finger. It was quite a snobbish figure, but he had great talent for him to not look hateful.\u201cIf you come in, I can become a vice-captain in no time. We need someone like you.\u201d\u201cI still refuse your offer.\u201d\u201cSo quickly? Why?\u201d\u201cMoney is the most important thing for a mercenary, but trust is the most important thing for assassins.\u201d\u201cTrust? That\u2019s old-fashioned. To turn down our offer for just that reason. I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll ever understand. The only thing I want is that you don\u2019t interfere with my request.\u201d\u201cA request? What kind of request? Do you mean you\u2019re commissioned by someone else to do this?\u201dGo Dosas voice rose to a high level. If Pyo-wol really did this at someone\u2019s request, it meant that that person had quite a background.Heo Ran-ju asked.\u201cWho is the client?\u201dPyo-wol didn\u2019t answer.At this moment, it was as if he could hear the voice of Lee Min as she was dying.-I want them to feel the same way I do. This miserable feeling of being trampled by an irresistible force.Although Lee Min was just saying her last words before her death, Pyo-wol recognized her words as a request. Even though he didn\u2019t get a single penny in return.It had already been seven years.It was the only thing he remembered.Even if he quit now, there was no one to say anything to.Even so, Pyo-wol had no intention of not fulfilling Lee Min\u2019s request.He was an assassin.He might have been born as an ordinary person, but was raised as an assassin.It was impossible to change the perception already deeply embedded in the crest. It was because it\u2019s already related to the identity of Pyo-wol.Go Dosa\u2019s voice broke Pyo-wol\u2019s thoughts.\u201cLast question. Who is the client?\u201dPerhaps it was because he thought it was important, so he asked the question in a ferocious manner, not like his usual carefree personality.Then, Ranju Heo intervened.\u201cIt\u2019s a girl.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cThere is only one case where a guy risks his life to do the impossible. It is when a girl is involved.\u201dHeo Ran-ju deduced with astonishing precision that a woman was involved using her woman\u2019s intuition. Even if the exact reason hasn\u2019t been revealed yet.Go Dosa smirked.\u201cA woman\u2019s request? You\u2019re more emotional than you look. It\u2019s stupid.\u201dIt was incomprehensible by the standards of Go Dosa to risk his life just because of a woman\u2019s request. It was also against his values.Heo Ran-ju stared at Pyo-wol with fierce eyes.\u201cWhat year?\u201dThe emotion in her voice was obviously jealousy.Normally, Go Dosa would have made fun of Heo Ran-ju, but he wasn\u2019t like that now. From experience, he knows that it is better not to get on Heo Ran-ju\u2019s nerves at this moment.Heo Ran-joo lashed out again.\u201cTell me! What kind of bitch are you?\u201dBang!Heo Ran-ju couldn\u2019t wait for a minute and hit the table with her fist. The table shattered and the food placed on the top was scattered everywhere.But that wasn\u2019t enough, Heo Ran-ju even threw her hand towards Pyo-wol\u2019s cheek. Jealousy flew away. At that moment, Pyo-wol kicked the broken table.Bang!\u201cKeuk!\u201dThe table collided with Heo Ran-ju\u2019s body and was completely smashed.\u201cRanju!\u201d\u201cAmitabha!\u201dHeo Ran-ju stumbled, and Go Dosa and Hyeol Seung moved at the same time. They would normally fight each other, but they still loved each other terribly.Pyo-wol was the one who they had to remove anyway. It was commissioned by the Emei sect, and there were already Black Cloud warriors all over the area.\u201cHaap!\u201dHyeol Seung stretched out his hands. Then, a mighty energy was poured out towards Pyo-wol. But instead of hitting head-on, Pyo-wol flew into the air.Bang!Pyo-wol\u2019s body soared into the air as he smashed the roof of the guest house. Pyo-wol, who suddenly floated up to about a dozen meters on the roof, looked around.\u201cIt\u2019s him!\u201d\u201cPyo-wol has popped out!\u201dPyo-wol saw the warriors\u00a0 shouting and pointing at him.They were the mercenaries of the Black Cloud Group. On every street, he could see the Black Cloud warriors all over the place.The Black Cloud Group was already building an entrapment around the guest house, where Pyo-wol was staying.Zhang Mu-ryang looked at Pyo-wol and grinned.\u201cYou\u2019re finally out of your fox den.\u201dFinding Pyo-wol was as difficult as finding the fox hiding in the burrow. Pyo-wol desperately walked around Chengdu with his face covered, and never left a trace of himself.Thanks to this, the Black Clouds Group had to go through a lot of trouble to find Pyo-wol.Zhang Mu-ryang released his entire army and searched the city, as if his nose was sweeping the bottom of the creek with a net. After three days of hard work, they found Pyo-wol.They didn\u2019t know that Pyo-wol was staying in a guest house near the White Flower Room where the Emei\u2019s troops were staying.Pyo-wol landed on the roof of the guest house.Afterwards, Heo Ran-ju, Hyeol Seung, and Go Dosa rushed out and surrounded him back and forth. However, Pyo-wol looked at Zhang Mu-ryang without paying attention to them.\u201cIt seems that you have been ordered by the Abbess of Nine Calamities.\u201d\u201cFufu! They made an offer that I couldn\u2019t refuse.\u201d\u201cSo, did you mobilize all your troops just to catch me?\u201d\u201cI understand. You\u2019re so unpredictable, so you\u2019re doing your best here, too. You can think of it as an honor. This is the first time that the entire Black Cloud Corps has been mobilized to catch just one person.\u201d\u201cYou will regret that decision.\u201d\u201cRegret? You\u2019ll be the one to regret it.\u201d\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have meddled in my war.\u201dPyo-wol\u2019s calm voice sounded strangely eerie. For a moment, Zhang Mu-ryang felt a chill in his spine. His eyes trembled as he felt his nerves stand on their feet as if they were screaming, and his head was shriveled all over.\u2018What?\u2019An unfamiliar feeling for the first time in his life made him shudder. Zhang Mu-ryang cried out unconsciously.\u201cCatch him!\u201dAs soon as his order was given, Heo Ran-ju, Go Dosa, and Hyeol Seung attacked Pyo-wol.\u201cHaaap!\u201d\u201cChaat!\u201d\u201cAmitabha!\u201dHeo Ran-ju swung her whip and aimed it at Pyo-wol\u2019s waist, while Go Dosa stretched out his qi to prevent Pyo-wol from avoiding the attack.The most powerful attack belonged to Hyeol Seung. As he swung his fist, a powerful force was released in front of Pyo-wol.Kwanzaa!When the three masters worked together, a powerful battle raged like a storm.In the middle of it was Pyo-wol. The hem of his clothes fluttered like crazy. But Pyo-wol himself didn\u2019t move at all.The Black Cloud Mercenary Group were moving in unison as if they were a single creature. They were moving and aiming only for Pyo-wol.\u201cWhere are you looking?\u201d\u201cAre you making fun of us?\u201dHeo Ran-ju and Go Dosa were furious at Pyo-wol\u2019s motionless appearance.The whip of Heo Ran-ju, the tension of Go Dosa, and the vigor of Hyeol Seung were about to hit Pyo-wol\u2019s body.Everyone thought it was too late for Pyo-wol to avoid.It was the same with Zhang Mu-ryang, who looked up from below.At that moment, the unbelievable happened.The figure of Pyo-wol had vanished from their sight. Thanks to that, the three men\u2019s attacks were in vain and cut through the air.\u201cWhat?\u201dAt the incredible sight, the three of them burst into consternation almost simultaneously. They were all masters who were considered to be the best in Jianghu. They could not believe that there was a new magic that could fool the attention of such masters and disappear.Ciit!The place where Pyo-wol reappeared was on the roof of another guest house, a dozen or so steps away from the guest house with three mercenaries.\u201cAre you using magic?\u201d\u201cChaat!\u201d\u201cEveryone, be careful. His technique is unusual.\u201dThey flew away towards the guest house in which Pyo-wol appeared. However, when they landed on the house, it was after Pyo-wol had moved onto another nearby full-angled roof.\u201cWhat?\u201dGo Dosa\u2019s eyes shook.\u00a0He had faced countless warriors before, but this was the first time he faced such an opponent as Pyo-wol. It felt like I was dealing with a ghost, not a human. The movement of Pyo-wol was beyond imagination.Black Lightning.1Pyo-wol gave the name of Black Lightning to his new skill, which he learned in the underground cave. Pyo-wol realized the concept of lightning through the Thunder-Splitting Method.The Black Lightning was one of the branches that grew out of the heart.The human body\u2019s response is driven by electrical signals, that is, brain power. Black Lightning adjusts the brain power to increase the body\u2019s reaction speed to the limit.By accelerating thinking through the speed of the lightning and increasing the reaction speed of the body to the limit through the black lightning, it embodies the same movement as the legendary technique, Immovable Spirit Method.2Bang!The three people\u2019s joint effort shattered the roof of the hall. However, it was after Pyo-wol had already left the roof of the hall and moved to another place.\u201cCrazy!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cPush harder!\u201dThe three men frantically attacked Pyo-Yeol. However, their attack was in vain and they only destroyed the pitiful pavilion roof.\u201cBastard!\u201dZhang Mu-ryang clenched his teeth at Pyo-wol\u2019s actions, which was better than expected. He gestured and gave orders to his subordinates.\u201cThis is a battlefield that is advantageous to him. Push him to the open ground. His \u2018magic\u2019 will be useless there.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dFifty masters waiting below took part in the battle.Kwakang!Their participation in the war made the warriors of Chengdu, who were otherwise sensitive, jump out.\u201cWhat? Who else are they?\u201d\u201cWhy are they collaborating against one guy?\u201dThe other warriors approached the street that recently became the battlefield to find out the full story of the incident.Zhang Mu-ryang gave the order to Yang Woo-jeong, the vice captain.\u201cStop the others from approaching.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dZhang Mu-ryang did not want this anomaly to grow and attract the attention of the other warriors. What he wanted was a quick end to their current situation.But what Pyo-wol wanted was the opposite.Pyo-wol, who had deflected the three men\u2019s attack with a black lightning bolt, attacked one of the warriors approaching the battlefield.\u201cWhat, what? Keuk!\u201dIt was already after Pyo-wol blew a blow in the warrior\u2019s chest when herealized what happened. After receiving a fatal blow, the warrior flew away and crashed into the wall. But he never complained of pain.\u00a0Because he was already dead.Although he killed one warrior in an instant, Pyo-wol had no intention of stopping. He moved in search of his next offering.\u201cHiiick!\u201d\u201cKekkeuk!\u201dHe killed two more warriors at once. Then, realizing Pyo-wol\u2019s intentions, Zhang Mu-ryang shouted.\u201cNo! Stop him!\u201dThe warriors of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group moved to prevent Pyo-wol from taking other people\u2019s lives. But before they could catch up, Pyo-wol already killed several more passerby warriors.\u201cWhat? These bastards!\u201d\u201cShit!\u201dThe image of Pyo-wol moving with the Black Cloud Mercenary Group on its tail seemed to lead the other warriors to attack them.\u201cStop those black-clad guys.\u201d\u201cDamn it!\u201dThe city became chaotic in an instant.The warriors misunderstood the Black Cloud Troops as Pyo-wol\u2019s companions and attacked them, and the Black Cloud Troops cut down the cumbersome warriors to capture Pyo-wol.\u201cWe have to stop it! He\u2019s trying to keep us into trouble with the others.\u201dZhang Mu-ryang belatedly realized Pyo-wol\u2019s intentions and tried to stop him, but the atmosphere was already going according to Pyo-wol\u2019s intentions.\u201cWaaa!\u201d\u201cThe warriors who came out on the street without knowing anything jumped into the fight.The streets were stained with blood.At the center was Pyo-wol.\u201cI\u2019ll bring out all the people who are hiding.\u201dA huge flame of madness that would burn the whole city of Chengdu was emanating from him.Hoped everyone enjoyed the chapter~ Don\u2019t forget to comment down below what you think of the chapter <3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 80": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 80Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFor the past three days, Pyo-wol has been observing the warriors entering Chengdu.As a result, he found out that they were divided into three categories.The first category is the Qingcheng sect and Golden Gates. Together with the other sects that follow them.The Fire Dragon Room is a prime example.Due to the previous battle, the Fire Dragon Room was completely on the side of the Qingcheng sect. In addition, many military officers and warriors followed the Qingcheng sect.The second group were those who supported the Emei sect.Quite a few factions, including the White Flower Room and Qing Ming Room, supported the Emei sect. However, their power did not reach that of those following the Qingcheng sect.The third were the warriors who neither belonged to the two factions.There were those who came in groups, and there were those who came individually. They were sneaking around the battlefield like wild dogs, looking for a chance to make a name for themselves.The third group was not controlled by anyone. And they are the most numerous.In a way, they were similar to the Black Cloud Mercenary Group. The only difference is that while the Black Cloud Mercenary Group are rogues wandering the battlefield aimlessly, they all have a residence in Sichuan.It was the third group that Pyo-wol attacked. By attacking them, the warriors were drawn into the battlefield.The third class of warriors, unlike the Qingcheng and the Emei sect,\u00a0 did not know what was going on in Chengdu.They just knew the atmosphere was serious.In such a situation, when they were suddenly attacked by Pyo-wol, they had the illusion that unidentified enemies were attacking them.\u201cBastards!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s kill all those in black-clad guys.\u201dThe warriors attacked the\u00a0 Black Cloud Mercenary Group without hesitation.\u201cDamn! These crazy bastards!\u201dYang Woo-jeong, the vice captain of the\u00a0 Black Cloud Mercenary Group, put on a puzzled expression.If there are one or two warriors, it won\u2019t be a problem, but if the number exceeds hundreds, the story is different.The problem is that even at this moment, the number of warriors joining the fight is growing exponentially. After hearing the news of the fight, the warriors of Chengdu came to them, and they were swept away by the battle between the Black Cloud Troops and the soldiers.Among them, there were many warriors belonging to sects that either supported the Emei and the Qingcheng sect. As they entered the war, the madness of the battlefield grew even more intense.The flames of madness started by Pyo-wol engulfed the entire city.\u201cDamn! How long are you going to cowardly run away?\u201dHyeol Seung burst out in anger and threw his fists at Pyo-wol.Gwaang!The roof of the front building where Pyo-wol was standing exploded like a blast bomb.\u201cKeuk!\u201d\u201cThat guy\u2026\u201dNearby warriors covered in shards attacked Hyeol Seung. Because of that, the Hyeol Seung\u2019s ankle was caught.\u201cShit!\u201dGo Dosa\u2019s face contorted.It was absurd.The Black Cloud Troops were thoroughly being dragged around by a single assassin. The movement of the Black Cloud Troops, which was supposed to move organically, was disrupted by Pyo-wol\u2019s attracting the nearby warriors.The most powerful time of the Black Cloud Troops was when they were united as one and unfolded their techniques. However, it was impossible to dream of an organic movement by getting tangled up with another uninvolved party.Moreover, the two hundred horse cavalry, which was the core, was not even used. They were still waiting on the outskirts of the city, waiting for their colleagues to drive Pyo-wol towards them.\u201cBastard!\u201dGo Dosa pushed his energy at the tip of his hand, and drove it toward Pyo-wol. It was the esoteric technique of Go Dosa called the Spirit Fire Dance.1\u00a0Go Dosa predicted that Pyo-wol would be able to avoid his attack this time as well.After being played around by Pyo-wol for quite a long time now, he was now able to predict Pyo-wol\u2019s movements in advance. It was just that his speed is not something they can catch up to.\u00a0Heo Ran-ju moved in advance to the point where Pyo-wol was expected to move.Ciit!Suddenly, something cut through the air and appeared in front of Go Dosa.\u201cHyuk!\u201dGo Dosa was startled and leaned back. He didn\u2019t even think of blocking it. It was an attack beyond his expectations. As a result, his internal energy was suddenly released.As his internal energy that should have been completely discharged backflowed, it caused damage to his internal organs.It was a single dagger that attacked Go Dosa. The dagger followed Go Dosa in a long trajectory like a living creature.\u201cAww!\u201dGo Dosa\u2019s scream rang out. His left arm fell to the ground and flapped. A dagger cut off the shoulder of Go Dosa.\u201cGo Dosa!\u201dHeo Ran-ju screamed loudly and ran towards Go Dosa. At that moment, another dagger appeared in front of her. The dagger moved dazzlingly and attacked Heo Ran-ju.\u00a0It was the ghost dagger.Pyo-wol controlled two ghost daggers with the Soul-Reaping Thread. The whip of Heo Ran-ju and the Soul-Reaping Thread were soon entangled.Surgerch!At that moment, Heo Ran-ju\u2019s whip was cut off.\u201cNo!\u201dHeo Ran-ju\u2019s eyes widened at the unbelievable sight.Ciiiit!At that moment, the ghost dagger cut through her side. Her clothes and flesh were split, and blood was pouring out.\u201cKheup!\u201dHeo Ran-ju swallowed a scream and hurriedly backed away. Still, she made sure her eyes still followed the movement of Pyo-wol.However, in the middle of doing so, Pyo-wol disappeared.He once again used the Black Lightning to move.However, the place where Pyo-wol appeared again was in front of Go Dosa. Go Dosa had lost one arm and was staggering, so he could not detect Pyo-wol\u2019s movement.\u201cNo!\u201dHeo Ran-joo hurriedly shouted.Go Dosa raised his head and looked at the front.Suddenly, Pyo-wol appeared in front of him. He held the ghost dagger in his own hands and took Go Dosa\u2019s life.\u201cStop!\u201dZhang Mu-ryang\u2019s cry echoed across the battlefield.After slashing over countless warriors blocking the way, he arrived next to Pyo-wol. He reached out to save Go Dosa.\u00a0A black spear was held in Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s hand.The Destruction of the Black Dragon,2\u00a0the secret art of the extended house,3\u00a0was unfolded.Kwaa!The black spear flew towards Pyo-wol, tearing apart the air. However, Pyo-wol did not care and stabbed Go Dosa in between the ribs with a ghost dagger.\u201cHeukp!\u201dGo Dosa\u2019s complexion changed.Because the ghost dagger had penetrated deep into his lungs.Go Dosa opened his mouth at the extreme pain he had experienced for the first time in his life. Go Dosa was trying to say something. However, Pyo-wol closed his mouth with his hand and switched positions with Go Dosa.Go Dosa, who was stabbed in the lungs, lost all his strength and could not resist.In an instant, Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s attack exploded where he was.Kwang!\u201cKeuk!\u201dThere was a roar and the scream of Go Dosa at the same time.Instead of Pyo-wol, Go Dosa was struck with the spear of Zhang Mu-ryang. Go Dosa\u2019s back became like a mop, revealing his white bones. He was fatally wounded by his colleague Zhang Mu-ryang.\u201cNo\u2026!\u201d\u201cGo Dosa!\u201dZhang Mu-ryang and Heo Ran-ju ran at the same time.At that moment, Pyo-wol turned his head and glanced at them. Cold eyes that did not contain a single emotion pierced their hearts like a dagger.\u201cGo Dosa!\u201dHeo Ran-ju\u2019s eyes were red and bloodshot, as if they were about to shed blood at any moment. Although they quarrel and fight every day, Heo Ran-ju liked Go Dosa more than anyone else.This is because the one who understood her best among the three hundred and fifty members of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group was Go Dosa.The sight of Go Dosa falling down was enough to make her eyes roll.She tried to attack, burning a grudge against Pyo-wol. But by that time, Pyo-wol had already flown away and disappeared.\u201cAre you okay, Dosa?\u201dHeo Ran-ju hurriedly hugged Go Dosa. However, Go Dosa was already in a state of severe paralysis.\u201cHuff! Huff!\u201dThe old master didn\u2019t even have the energy to answer, so he took a deep breath.\u201cDamn it!\u201dZhang Mu-ryang clenched his teeth.Because it was as if he had killed Go Dosa. Heo Ran-ju shouted at Zhang Mu\u2013ryang.\u201cCome on, chase him! Be sure to tear him apart and kill him!\u201dAt her cry, Zhang Mu-ryang flew in the direction where Pyo-wol disappeared. Heo Ran-ju was crying with Go Dosa in his arms.\u201cGo Dosa! P, please don\u2019t die. Hik! You can\u2019t die.\u201dGo Dosa reached out and took Heo Ran-ju\u2019s hand.\u201cBitch! Who\u2019s going to die- yea- that\u2019s a bad thing\u2026 you say? I\u2019m not going to die\u2026 uh.\u201dGo Dosa forced a laugh.* * *Bang!An Emei\u2019s disciple kicked off the door and ran into the abode of the Guhwasata.\u201cThis is a big deal, sect leader!\u201d\u201cWhy are you making a fuss?\u201dGuhwasata looked at the disciple with ferocious eyes.The disciple, who would normally have been withdrawn, continued talking without hesitation. That\u2019s because the matter was urgent.\u201cThe whole city is currently in a frenzy.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cTh, there\u2019s been a riot.\u201d\u201cRiot?\u201dUnknowingly, the Guhwasata jumped out of the chair. That\u2019s because the meaning of the word \u2018riot\u2019 was serious.\u201cTell me more.\u201d\u201cThe Black Cloud Mercenary Group moved to capture the assassin, but their movements provoked the warriors who flocked to Chengdu. So the assassin clashed with the Black Cloud Mercenary Group and the nearby warriors.\u201d\u201cHa!\u201dHearing the disciple\u2019s words, Guhwasata sighed involuntarily.It is unbelievable that a single assassin caused a clash between the Black Cloud Group and the nearby warriors.The disciple\u2019s words continued.\u201cThe fight grew bigger and bigger, and now even the sects supporting our main sect are being swept away.\u201d\u201cDoes that mean that Qing Ming Room and other military officers also got involved in the fight?\u201d\u201cYes! Not only that, but the clans who came to support the Qingcheng sect also jumped into the fight, and the whole city was engulfed in blood.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201dShe put on an expression that she found the whole situation as absurd.It is unbelievable that this kind of situation happened just because of one assassin. At that time, Yong Seol-ran, who was sitting on the opposite side of Guhwasata, opened her mouth.\u201cMaster, you have to believe.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cSeven years ago, he overturned everyone\u2019s expectations and killed Woo Gunsang of the Qingcheng sect alone. Because of that, the relationship between the Qingcheng sect and our sect deteriorated.\u201d\u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d\u201cWhat I mean is that all of this is just part of the big picture he painted.\u201d\u201cThe big picture? Are you saying that an assassin can read and preside over a large situation?\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s actually happening.\u201d\u201cStop talking and sit down.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not nonsense. What\u2019s going on right now shows how scary he is. He\u2019s not just an assassin. He just happen to learn assassination skills.\u201d\u201cSeol-ran!\u201dGuhwasata frowned and motioned for her to stop, but Yong Seol-ran did not stop talking.\u201cThis would not have happened if we hadn\u2019t commissioned the assassination of Woo Gunsang in the first place. It is the responsibility of our sect that such a terrible being was born.\u201d\u201cSo what do you want to say? Are you asking me to kneel in front of him and apologize?\u201d\u201cNo! Master would never do something like that. I mean just be careful. He won\u2019t stop until he kills Master.\u201d\u201cHeh! Even if ten assassins come all at once, they won\u2019t be able to touch a single hair of mine.\u201dGuhwasata snorted.She did not heed Yong Seol-ran\u2019s advice. It was because she possessed powerful martial arts and was the leader of the elite faction known as the Emei sect.If the Emei sect\u2019s leader hides because she is afraid of an assassin, all of her fellow sect leaders in Jianghu will laugh at her.Yong Seol-ran heaved a sigh.She already thought that Guhwasata would never listen to her, but she didn\u2019t really know that she would be this stubborn.Yong Seol-ran looked at the situation with gloomy eyes.Even when Guhwasata accepted her as a disciple, she was still intimidating. But she wasn\u2019t as scary as she used to be.Maybe it was because she had already developed a tolerance or because she had grown that much, she didn\u2019t know. However, Yong Seol-ran didn\u2019t want to challenge her Master any further.\u201cHuuu!\u201dIt was time for her to sigh again.Suddenly the door swung open and another disciple entered the room.Guhwasata asked,\u00a0\u201cWhat else is going on?\u201d\u201cThe Qing Ming Room asked for help. They bumped into the Fire Dragon Room, and they\u2019re being pushed back because their power is inferior.\u201d\u201cQing Ming Room?\u201dGuhwasa\u2019s face contorted.If it was the Qing Ming Room, they were still a friendly sect to the Emei sect. If the crisis of Qing Ming Room is overlooked, other sects will never follow the Emei sect.\u201cWe\u2019re being dragged to the assassin\u2019s plans.\u201dGuhwasata gritted her teeth.There was no reason not to get involved in the fight now.There was nowhere to escape.She grabbed her staff and said,\u201cBefore the disciples of the Qingcheng sect jump into the fight, the situation must be calmed down. All my disciples, take up your arms and follow me.\u201dGuhwasata and the rest of the Emei sect are now also being swept away to the bloodstream.Hoped everyone enjoyed the chapter~ Don\u2019t forget to comment down below what you think of the chapter <3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Several clans based near Chengdu tried to calm the unrest, but to no avail.The madness spread not only among the warriors, but also among the common people.Taking advantage of the extreme chaos, some people started looting shops and wealthy houses. It was a small number at first, but the number of predators quickly grew exponentially.Store owners who could not afford to hire martial artists as workers fought the mobs with their own sticks. It was no different for the rich families.They would normally have paid money and easily hired soldiers, but at present, there were no warriors who would be willing to be stationed in Chengdu.The fierce battle between those who wanted to steal and those who wanted to protect drove the chaotic saints into even greater chaos.No one could have imagined that the security of Chengdu would be so easily destroyed.The entire system of the Chengdu, which had been strong for hundreds of years, was collapsing like a flowing sand castle.The madness of the warriors engulfed the entire city.While Pyo-wol, who was the starting point of all these events, is at present not in Chengdu. He escaped the city taking advantage of the chaos and confusion.But there was one man who pursued Pyo-wol.It was Zhang Mu-ryang, the leader of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group. He followed Pyo-wol with a face reminiscent of a monster.\u2018He must be killed.\u2019He always had a relaxed smile, but his reason was blown away in front of the injury of the Go Dosa.Go Dosa was not just a subordinate.He was like a teacher who guided him from an early age. Because he looked after him, he was able to become the leader of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group. That is why he was always respectful to Go Dosa.Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s anger pierced the sky because Go Dosa was seriously wounded by his own attack.His anger was directed at Pyo-wol. Pyo-wol was supposed to be killed anyway, but Zhang Mu-ryan vowed to kill him even more horribly.He doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s a coincidence or luck, but the direction Pyo-wol was running to, was where the cavalry of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group were waiting.Due to the nature of the cavalry, whose power is maximized on horseback, it was difficult to enter the city of Chengdu, so they were waiting outside.Huiic!Zhang Mu-ryang blew a long whistle. Then, in the distance, out of the darkness, a torch appeared and drew a large circle.It was a signal from the Black Cloud Troops who were on standby. Zhang Mu-ryang whistled once again.Dududu!Then, the sound of hoofs shaking the earth reverberated in the night sky. Two hundred horses were moving in unison.\u201cBastard! There is no more place for you to escape. Give up!\u201dZhang Mu-ryang shouted loudly and swung his spear. Then the fierce spear arose and shot at Pyo-wol.In an instant, Pyo-wol\u2019s body moved.He dodged the long-range attack without looking back as if he had an eye on the back of his head. But his crisis was not over.His eyes, which pierced through the darkness, saw the horsemen galloping with terrifying momentum. Two hundred horsemen made up of warriors. They were the true strength of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group.Their martial arts may lag a little behind the other members, but their true power is revealed when they gallop on horseback.When two hundred or so horses raced as if they were one body, any master from Jianghu had no choice but to shiver.\u201cHaat!\u201d\u201cThere!\u201dThe horsemen all pulled out their spears and aimed at the front. A long spear was the weapon suited the horsemen the most. It was the same reason that Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s weapon was also a spear.Dududu!It wasn\u2019t as visible because it was night, but a cloud of dust rose up from behind the two hundred people.They only have one goal.Two hundred horses started running to kill Pyo-wol. No matter how great he was, a person would\u00a0 be helpless in front of two hundred horsemen.Zhang Mu-ryang naturally thought that Pyo-wol would choose to run away. However, as if to ridicule his prediction, Pyo-wol instead rushed towards the horsemen.\u201cYou said that you can\u2019t die. Trample him and kill him!\u201dZhang Mu-ryang\u2019s voice resounded in the night sky. As if in response to his words, the horsemen accelerated further.Cwaeeck!The spears were pointed at the front. Then the cavalrymen threw their spears at Pyo-wol using their internal energy. Even in the dark, their spears flew straight towards Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol flew towards the flying spear. It looked like he was about to commit suicide.\u201cMadman!\u201dAlthough Zhang Mu-ryang cursed, he did not let down his guard. This is because Pyo-wol has always far exceeded expectations.It was the same this time too.Just before being hit by dozens of spears, Pyo-wol disappeared from their sight. The place where Pyo-wol reappeared was above the head of the leading cavalryman. He quickly shortened the space and moved using Black Lightning.Ciiit!The ghost daggers were released.\u201cNo\u2026!\u201d\u201cHaap!\u201dThe horsemen, who were considered as elite, instinctively sensed a crisis and swung their spears to protect their entire body.But they didn\u2019t know.The fact that the ghost dagger which Pyo-wol threw was not just a dagger.The ghost dagger, combined with Soul-Reaping Thread, was able to freely change the trajectory according to Pyo-wol\u2019s finger movements.The ghost daggers dug in between the gap of the spears. And took two lives.\u201cGah!\u201d\u201cKerhyuk!\u201dIt was just the beginning.Pyo-wol moved using the Black Lightning. The place where he appeared again was a horse that had lost its owner. Standing on the back of his horse, he threw a ghost dagger.Ciiit!A terrifying pounding sound echoed through the night sky.\u201cKeuk!\u201d\u201cGuergh!\u201dA scream rang out again.\u201cCatch him!\u201d\u201cDamn it!\u201dConfusion arose among the horsemen. Many enemies have been trampled on and been pierced through by their spears. No one so far dared to jump among the galloping horsemen. Because it\u2019s suicidal.But here comes a person doing such a crazy thing.Pyo-wol stepped on a horse that was galloping at crazy speed and moved. And he killed the horsemen with his ghost dagger.The moment the horsemen attacked with their spears, Pyo-wol had already disappeared.Darkness was Pyo-wol\u2019s greatest weapon.Pyo-wol used the Black Lightning to move through the darkness and used the ghost daggers to assassinate the cavalrymen.Pyo-wol was thoroughly breaking the prejudice that assassins only attack while in hiding.\u201cStop! You crazy bastard!\u201dZhang Mu-ryang belatedly joined the horsemen. He got on the lost horse and rushed towards Pyo-wol.Huuung!He threw up his spear. As he twisted his wrist, the spear rotated and rushed towards the Pyo-wol. However, his spear did not meet Pyo-wol, and in vain it ripped through the air.It was because Pyo-wol already flew in the other direction. Pyo-wol moved from one horse to another and played around with the horsemen.Ciiit!Two Soul-Reaping Threads were attached to two ghost daggers. They split the darkness vertically and horizontally. And each time, a horseman would die.The death dance performed by the assassin Pyo-wol was ruthlessly ravaging the horsemen. In the midst of it, Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s cry echoed hollowly.\u201cStop! Stop it! You bastard!\u201d* * *\u201cWhat? This crazy landscape\u2026\u201dGuhwasata looked forward with a blank expression for a moment.The city was on fire.It was not said metaphorically, since there were really big fires all over Chengdu. The looters not only stole things, but also set the establishments on fire.As a result, Chengdu was heading towards greater chaos.Inside, the warriors were fighting fiercely to kill each other. Numerous warriors had already died, and many more were groaning with wounds.The blood they shed was soaking the floor.It was as if hell had unfolded.All of this happened in just a few hours.No one expected that Chengdu, the center of Sichuan Province, would turn into hell in an instant.Yong Seol-ran said to Guhwasata.\u201cMaster, we need to get to the Qing Ming Room and calm the situation as soon as possible. If we miss the right timing, we will be unable to rectify the situation.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dThis time, the Guhwasata also agreed with Agave. The situation was more serious than she expected.In the worst case, Chengdu, the center of Sichuan Province, would find it impossible to recover and thus become a wasteland. In that case, even if they won the war with the Qingcheng sect, there was little to be gained.The worst case had to be prevented.Guhwasata shouted.\u201cEveryone! Attack the Fire Dragon Room!\u201d\u201cWaaa!\u201dAt her command, the disciples of the Emei sect and White Flower Room broke into the battlefield where the Qing Ming Room and Fire Dragon Room were fighting.Fo Sanhae, the sect leader of the Fire Dragon Room, was greatly flustered by the Emei sect\u2019s intervention.\u201cEveryone, beware! The Emei sect is here.\u201dOn the other hand, Ki Joo-han, the sect leader of the Qing Ming Room, shouted with a hundredfold of courage.\u201cThe Emei sect is here to help. Everyone, be strong!\u201d\u201cWaaa!\u201dThe shouts of Qing Ming Room resounded throughout the city. The morale of the Qing Ming Room increased, and Fire Dragon Room, on the other hand, was greatly weakened by the intervention of the Emei warriors.\u201cGet out of the way!\u201dKwawawang!Guhwasata struck the Fire Dragon Room\u2019s warriors who were blocking her way with her staff and headed towards the Fire Dragon Rooms\u2019s sect leader Fo Sanhae.\u201cKeuk!\u201d\u201cHyeok!\u201dThe warriors of the Fire Dragon Room, who had been beaten by her staff, screamed and flew in all directions. The sight of them rolling on the floor was terrifying.Broken limbs and depressed breastbones were the norm. No matter how they hang on for their lives, they have to endure living with a disability for the rest of their lives.It\u2019s an outcome worse than dying.Guhwasata executed the Golden Light Sword method, a new technique of the Emei school. Its power deserved to be called the Emperor of Destruction.No one dared to withstand her blow.In an instant, a dozen or so Fire Dragon Room warriors rolled on the floor, lying on their blood. Seeing the situation, the Fo Sanhae ran to stop Guhwasata.\u201cYou witch! Can\u2019t you stop right now?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve gone overboard. Sect leader Fo. How dare you call me that.\u201dGuhwasata stared at Fo Sanhae with ferocious eyes.The spirit of Fo Sanhae was broken by her strong momentum. But he could not back down or show his weakness. Although he was far inferior to the Emei sect, he was also the master of a clan.If he shows weakness, the morale of the Fire Dragon Room disciples will drop. So he had no choice but to go all out.\u201cShut up and retreat your troops. This is a matter between the Fire Dragon Room and the Qing Ming Room. It is not for the Emei sect to intervene.\u201d\u201cHong! You have to say something that makes sense. Everyone knows that the Qing Ming Room is affiliated with the Emei sect, and yet you\u2019re still talking nonsense like that? Sect leader Fo is stupider than you look.\u201d\u201cWho said that? I just\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201dGuhwasata interrupted Fo Sanhae and attacked.Gwaang!\u201cKeuk!\u201dThe Fo Sanhae swung his sword and barely prevented the attack of Guhwasata. However, the attack of the Guhwasata was only the beginning.Hong-heung!The Golden Light Sword method was performed. The power of the Golden Light Sword method, one of the Emei sect\u2019s best attacks, was truly terrifying.The Fo Sanhae, the sect leader of the Fire Dragon Room, stumbled without being able to withstand more than ten seconds of the attack. Fo Sanhae\u2019s complexion was pale, and blood was dripping from his lips. He suffered deep internal injuries during the dozen clashes.\u2018That witch\u2019s martial arts are really scary.\u2019Fo Sanhae felt himself approaching death.He knew there was a gap between Fire Dragon Room and the Emei sect, but he didn\u2019t really know that there would be such a huge difference.He wasn\u2019t their opponent at all.It was then that Fo Sanhae realized why so many sects in Jianghu were afraid of prestigious sects such as the Emei.Bang!Every time he collided with the staff, he felt a shock as if he was being hit directly with an iron rod.\u201cKekkeuk!\u201dIn the end, Fo Sanhae could not withstand the shock and vomited blood.Hoo-heung!The staff of the Guhwasata fell on the head of Fo Sanhae, who had lost his strength and knelt down. It was clear that Foshanhae\u2019s head would be shattered if he was hit directly by the staff.There\u2019s a dark expression on Fo Sanhae\u2019s face.\u201cStop!\u201dWith an angry voice, someone rushed forward. Using his sword, he stopped the staff from striking Fo Sanhae.Jjooeng!With the intense strike, Guhwasata was thrown backwards.A strong sense of vigilance flashed in the eyes of Guhwasata, who took a dozen steps back to regain her balance. The attack was loaded with incredible strength.It was so strong that even a rock the size of a house could be pounded into powder. The man who suddenly intervened and received Guhwasata\u2019s attack without much shock.Guhwasata has no choice but to back off.Having that kind of force was rare in Sichuan.\u201cMu\u2026 Jeong-jin.\u201dOne of the few people who possessed that kind of force was Mu Jeong-jin, who is currently blocking the front of the Fo Sanhae.Hoped everyone enjoyed the chapter~ Don\u2019t forget to comment down below what you think of the chapter <3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 82": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 82Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe eyes of the ferocious Guhwasata changed even more terribly.After Go Yeopjin, the former elder, the strongest master produced by the Qingcheng sect was Mu Jeong-jin.No matter how much Guhwasata was said to be the sect leader of the Emei sect, she could not dare to downplay the prowess of Mu Jeong-jin.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Mu Jeong-jin!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s so nice to see you like this, Guhwasata.\u201d\u201cIs that right? I\u2019m not happy at all.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting to see you for seven years. So how can I not be happy?\u201dThere was a chill in the voice of Mu Jeong-jin, who responded coldly.His eyes were full of hostility as he looked at the situation.Woo Gunsang, the future of the Qingcheng sect was killed by an assassin who was ordered by Guhwasata.Mu Jeong-jin, who loved Woo Gunsang more than anyone else, suffered from a profound sense of loss. The sense of loss turned to anger, and anger turned to the Guhwasata, the culprit of all these situations.However, no matter how great the martial arts he possessed, he could not deal with the entirety of the Emei sect.Mu Jeong-jin proposed to Muryeongjin, their sect leader, to lead all his disciples and attack the Emei sect. However, Muryeongjin rejected his offer at once.No matter how bad the Emei were, they felt burdened by the fact that both of them were the same prestigious sects.Mu Jeong-jin was disappointed with the indecisive Muryeongjin.So he just waited and practiced martial arts. All of this was to take revenge on the Guhwasata. However, Guhwasata was like an old fox, and never left her abode in Mount Emei.Although this should have been enough for him to be disappointed and give up, Mu Jeong-jin did not despair and waited patiently.He waited for seven years.Finally, Mu Jeong-jin encountered the being he had longed to meet.Guhwasata felt exactly the same.Guhwasata frowned at the momentum that Mu Jeong-jin radiated without filtration. For some reason, she felt that the spirit of Mu Jeong-jin was unusual.She couldn\u2019t believe that a dark and insidious momentum was radiating from those who had mastered the martial arts of the Qingcheng, which is a sect based on the teachings of Taoism.Guhwasata opened her mouth.\u201cYou seemed to have gained enlightenment recently. I can feel a mysterious energy that I have never seen in you before.\u201d\u201cEnlightenment? I just learned a new method.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t even imagine how much the martial arts of the Qingcheng sect were dead. I can\u2019t even imagine this story. Still, I was confident that I knew the martial arts of the Qingcheng sect well, but I never dreamed that you would be hiding martial arts that radiated such murky energy.\u201dGuhwasata sarcastically said that he learned martial arts that did not match the Qingcheng sect, but Mu Jeong-jin, responded with an expression that it was not a big deal.\u201cDon\u2019t judge the Qingcheng sect by your standards. The sky of Qingcheng is wider and wider than that of the Emei sect\u2019s.\u201d\u201cHeh! I don\u2019t know if your sect is really so great.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll find out soon enough. How great and how frightening our sect that you have touched.\u201d\u201cAha! Is it so great that you\u2019re being played around by a mere assassin?\u201d\u201cAssassin?\u201dMu Jeong-jin\u2019s eyebrows twitched at the unexpected words of Guhwasata. The displeasure given by the word assassin stimulated the minds of Mu Jeong-jin.\u201cWhat do you mean? What assassin?\u201d\u201cThe assassin you killed in the underground cave is still alive.\u201d\u201cDo not lie. He already died.\u201d\u201cHave you checked his body?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cLook at that. You didn\u2019t check, did you? Look at what happened now.\u201dGuhwasata criticized Mu Jeong-jin.However, Mu Jeong-jin did not mind the criticism of the Guhwasata.\u201cSo you mean he\u2019s still alive?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! He\u2019s the same guy who killed the young master of the Thunder Gates, and it\u2019s also him who incited the clash with the Qingcheng sect to lead my disciple Jeonghwa to her death.\u201d\u2018\u201cIf what you\u2019re saying is true, we\u2019re being thoroughly teased by an assassin.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! So, let\u2019s solve our fight after we catch him.\u201d\u201cI refuse.\u201dMu Jeong-jin rejected the proposal of the Guhwasata.Guhwasata rolled her eyes and asked,\u201cYou mean you won\u2019t catch the assassin who killed your disciple?\u201d\u201cIf he\u2019s really alive, he\u2019ll surely die by my hand.\u201d\u201cBut why?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t the real enemy in front of me who instigated him? How could I miss this golden opportunity after waiting for seven years?\u201d\u201cHong! Like a master of the Qingcheng sect, the front and back are completely blocked. To neglect the real enemy for just one small silver won.\u201d\u201cShut up, Guhwasata! Don\u2019t try to make fun of me with that silver tongue.\u201dThe momentum of Mu Jeong-jin rose like a storm and swept the area.\u201cHeop!\u201dFo Sanhae, who was behind Mu Jeong-jin, landed on his buttocks and fell to the floor. He looked at Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s back with fearful eyes.\u2018It was not a lie to say Mu Jeong-jin is the best warrior in Qingcheng sect.\u2019Fo Sanhae was also a sect leader of a clan. But even he felt fearful and withered by the momentum radiating from Mu Jeong-jin.The momentum fired by Mu Jeong-jin was formidable. Mu Jeong-jin shouted as he walked towards the Guhwasata.\u201cThe Qingcheng Seven Swords will help the Fire Dragon Room to defeat the Emei sect.\u201d\u201cBy your order!\u201dWith a strong answer, the seven swordsmen appeared out of nowhere. All of them who were exuding a sharp force were the Qingcheng Seven Swords taught by Mu Jeong-jin himself.The seven swords representing the Qingcheng sect attacked the disciples of Emei as they were tasked.Chuang!The sound of weapons clashing echoed everywhere.There were only seven people, but their strength made the war situation tilted back to their favor.\u201cThe Qingcheng sect is here to help us. Stay strong, everyone!\u201d\u201cHaap!\u201dThe disciples of the White Flower Room rushed in with a hundredfold of courage, while the warriors of the Emei sect were greatly flustered.The fight between the warriors was bound to depend on their momentum. The momentum changes depending on who is stronger. The momentum of the Qingcheng Seven Sword was enough to change the flow.Guhwasata, who looked around, changed her expression to look like a monster. If not, the impression that resembled a crow has changed to a more ferocious one.\u201cGuryeo, who refuses to give permission and chooses punishment. Mu Jeong-jin.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll say it. Old crow of Mount Emei.\u201d\u201cHow dare you talk like that. I can\u2019t forgive you.\u201dA very angry Guhwasata rushed towards Mu Jeong-jin.Hoo-heung!Her staff cut through the air, creating dozens of illusions. It was the beginning of the Golden Light Sword method.Before the staff could reach him, a terrifying pressure swept down on Mu Jeong-jin.This, too, was the function of the Golden Light Sword method.Schiak!However, with just one swing of his sword, Mu Jeong-jin cut off all the formidable energy that had weighed him down.\u201cPay for your sins with death.\u201dMu Jeong-jin faced the Guhwasata head-on.Jjooeng!As they fought, a strong wave of qi swept through the area like a storm. The qi also reached Yong Seol-ran, who was fighting one of the Seven Swords.The hem of Yong Seol-ran was swept away by the strong wind.\u2018Not good!\u2019The situation was changing so rapidly that it was impossible to foresee even an inch ahead. The whole city was engulfed in blood. She couldn\u2019t even imagine where the blood flow would end.\u2018Pyo-wol!\u2019She scans the battlefield in search of the man who started it all. However, the figure of Pyo-wol was nowhere to be seen.\u2018What else are you planning on doing?\u2019Just imagining it gave her goosebumps.* * *\u201cHeueu!\u201d\u201cKeuk!\u201dRough breathing echoed through the battlefield.It was the breath of the horsemen of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group. The condition of the horsemen was dire. Of the two hundred horsemen, a third were either dead or seriously wounded, and the rest of the warriors also had minor wounds and were breathing heavily.\u201cI can\u2019t do this\u2026 to an assassin one day\u2026\u201dZhang Mu-ryang looked around in disbelief. Although they had fought many wars, this is the first time that they suffered such great damage.\u00a0The horsemen were difficult to raise and more difficult to maintain. The horsemen had to learn strong discipline and military force at the same time. They didn\u2019t get along with the freedom-loving men of Jianghu. For that reason, Zhang Mu-ryang also recruited warriors from outside the city instead of the martial artists of Jianghu to maintain the horsemen.The tragic fall of the horsemen maintained by pouring huge sums of money each year to just one person was a great blow to Zhang Mu-ryang.Pyo-wol was the natural enemy of the horsemen.He never met the horsemen head-on. Cowardly dodging, creating chaos, and broke through the chaos. The combination of Black Lightning and the darkness while using the Soul-Reaping Thread made it so easy to miss its trajectory even when looking at it with their eyes open.\u00a0Hunting the horsemen who had stopped charging made it even easier. The ghost dagger and the Soul-Reaping thread taking the lives of horsemen was like the scythes of peasants during harvest season.Zhang Mu-ryang struggled to prevent such a situation, but could not catch up with Pyo-wol in the end.\u00a0His movements were like a snake. Even with the slightest gap, the snake slid out and ravaged the horsemen. Pyo-wol\u2019s actions, which were like that, gradually destroyed the core that Zhang Mu-ryang built as strong as an iron wall.\u00a0Whenever a horseman gets done in, a part of Zhang Mu-ryang also collapses.Pyo-wol paused for a moment and picked up the rough contraption. But from his appearance, they couldn\u2019t tell at all that he was using his qi.A white face and red eyes that stand out especially in the dark. His red lips with the slightly raised corners of his mouth and the strange atmosphere mixed with darkness combined made Pyo-wol look non-human.\u201cAre you\u2026 the grim reaper?\u201dZhang Mu-ryang muttered without knowing it.It was Zhang Mu-ryang, who overcame numerous crises so far and lived without knowing fear. But at this moment, he was genuinely afraid.He really didn\u2019t know that he would feel such an unfamiliar feeling for a single assassin. He twisted his spear in fear, and his palms were wet with sweat.Zhang Mu-ryang exploded his qi to dispel the fear that was engulfing his heart.\u201cYour opponent is me. Don\u2019t be a coward and run away, Pyo-wol!\u201dPyo-wol\u2019s gaze turned to him as if Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s shout had worked. Now Pyo-wol\u2019s eyes were completely red. Those eyes were like snakes aiming for prey.Although he killed many people, there was no tribulation in Pyo-wol\u2019s heart.It was the Black Cloud Mercenary Group who targeted himself first. He and the Black Clouds Mercenary Group were essentially no different. In the sense that they move to kill others for a price.\u2018No, is it different? Because I haven\u2019t received anything in return yet.\u2019It didn\u2019t matter anyway. The price of this battle will surely be paid in some way.It wasn\u2019t a fight he started.It wasn\u2019t like he wanted to start.But the end of this war will come to an end.Suddenly, Pyo-wol\u2019s gaze turned towards Chengdu. There were fires all over the place. It was proof that the chaos had reached its peak.That was human nature.Most people live by strict rules, but some people think of rules as shackles and feel frustrated.What Pyo-wol did was just set the mood for some people to let their true natures come out to their heart\u2019s content. At first, they are just a few deviants but their actions are highly contagious and attract those around them.People united in a group forgot their fears and flew by paralyzing their reason with madness.The result was the great chaos of Chengdu.Warriors who were indistinguishable from ordinary people, were all going crazy for their own benefit.Zhang Mu-ryang shouted.\u201cAre you feeling relieved now? You crazy bastard! I\u2019ve heard a lot of people say they\u2019re crazy too, but compared to you, they\u2019re just a child. You\u2019re throwing the whole city into chaos.\u201dHe was genuinely angry with Pyo-wol.\u00a0Pyo-wol was a great evil.An absolute evil that must be defeated.Zhang Mu-ryang defined Pyo-wol as such.\u201cI will surely kill you with my own hands, Pyo-wol! No matter what!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about?\u201d\u201cDid I do something so bad that you called me that?.\u201d\u201cLook at what you did. The whole city is stained with blood because of you.\u201d\u201cEveryone lives like that.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t Jianghu the kind of place where you, the Qingcheng sect, and Emei sect all live like that? So why am I called the crazy one?\u201dPyo-wol was genuinely curious.How many people must have been sacrificed by the Qingcheng and the Emei sect to gain the scale and fame they have today?Over hundreds of years, countless people have died and become manure for their growth.It was the same with the Black Cloud Mercenary group.A group of three hundred and fifty people would have had to kill at least ten times more people to maintain their current form and prowess.All he did was throw a small spark at them.\u00a0It was their greed and desire that fueled the fire.If they had come here for a really pure purpose, a catastrophe like today would not have happened.It was a reproduction of the inescapable net seven years ago.The only thing that has changed since then is that the Pyo-wol is no longer an easy prey. Those who dare to harm him, Pyo-wol will follow them to the end of hell and bite their necks.That was the way Pyo-wol fought.It didn\u2019t matter if Zhang Mu-ryang didn\u2019t understand.He has lived that way in the past, and he will continue to live that way in the future.\u201cYou\u2019re really crazy.\u201dZhang Mu-ryang trembled and attacked Pyo-wol.His instincts were whispering.If he doesn\u2019t get rid of Pyo-wol now, a bigger disaster will come.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In other words, it also meant that the power of Janggachang without riding a horse would be halved.It was not just a matter of Zhang Mu-ryang.It was a weakness that all horsemen had.While dealing with the horsemen of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group, Pyo-wol recognized their weaknesses. Therefore, without giving them a distance, he penetrated between the horsemen and went for a melee fight.It was a method that a normal assassin would have never done..Most assassins don\u2019t fight dog fights by inducing melee battles like this. It wasn\u2019t because they weren\u2019t capable of doing it but because it was a fight that was far from the essence of an assassin.It was a method that only Pyo-wol in Jianghu could do.Zhang Mu-ryang was also a seasoned warrior with a lot of experience, but his reason was shaken when he was swept away by the board Pyo-wol had made.Kwang!Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s spear made a change in the air and fired a sharp lance. But, like a snake, Pyo-wol slowly escaped from his attack.The snake step2, which was made to mimic the movement of a snake, made it possible to escape as long as there was a gap as small as the eye of a needle.Zhang Mu-ryang\u2019s attack was powerful, but crude. Most of the martial arts that were honed on the battlefield were like that.It was powerful, but it lacked sophistication.That was also the difference between the martial arts of an elite sect and the martial arts of a mercenary. Unlike the famous martial arts of great sects that have been making up for their weaknesses for a long time, there were bound to be many loopholes here and there with the martial arts of mercenaries.Such flaws were clearly visible in Pyo-wol\u2019s eyes.It was also thanks to the rapid rise of Pyo-wol\u2019s martial arts. The years he spent with the snakes greatly opened up most of Pyo-wol\u2019s possibilities.Pyo-wol did not miss the movement of the horsemen while facing Zhang Mu-ryang. The horsemen tried to help Zhang Mu-ryang, but Pyo-wol gave them no chance.Ciiit!Two ghost daggers moved vertically and horizontally. One of the daggers attacked the horsemen, while the other attacked Zhang Mu-ryang.Pyo-wol performed a stunt that could only be performed after mastering the martial arts, such as the Wudang\u2019s Yangui Simgong,3\u00a0without difficulty.\u201cDamn! Are you just going to continue dodging?\u201dZhang Mu-ryang mocked Pyo-wol, who evaded without colliding him head-on.It was intended to arouse Pyo-wol\u2019s anger and make him attack head-on. But he did not know Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol was a person who could run away with his tail between his legs at any time for survival. It was impossible for Pyo-wol to lose his reason just because of this level of provocation.It didn\u2019t matter if he was mocked.It was okay to be ridiculed all day long. None of that mattered. What really matters is being patient to achieve his desired result.Pyo-wol focused more of his energy on the ghost dagger.Then, the intangible Soul-Reaping Thread lit up and appeared.\u00a0The Soul-Reaping Thread, which revealed the form, was beautiful. The\u00a0 Soul-Reaping Thread with strong light was clear enough to be seen from afar.It was more like an art to see the two threads moving vertically and horizontally.Ciiit!\u201cKeuk!\u201d\u201cGargh!\u201dAs the name suggests,\u00a0 the Soul-Reaping Thread harvested the souls of the horsemen and left a deep dent on the spear of Zhang Mu-ryang.Nevertheless, Zhang Mu-ryang felt that Pyo-wol was not doing his best. To him, Pyo-wol looked like he was conserving power as if to stall for time.If he was really going to face the cavalry with all his might, there was no reason for Pyo-wol to reveal the Soul-Reaping Thread. Its power might become stronger, but as a consequence, the form and shape is revealed, making the opponents capable of defending from its attack.The problem was that Pyo-wol would know that too.There was no way he could infuse energy into the Soul-Reaping Thread for no reason, revealing his weapon to the public.\u201cWhat are you up to?\u201dPyo-wol didn\u2019t answer.Instead, more energy was injected into the Soul-Reaping Thread to make it shine brighter.That was then.\u00a0A group of people ran out of Chengdu.\u201cDo you think you will be able to escape in front of me? Guhwasata!\u201d\u201cHeh! Who\u2019s escaping? Arrogant fool!\u201dThose who exchanged venomous remarks and fought fiercely with each other were Mu Jeong-jin and Guhwasata. While the disciples of the Qingcheng and the Emei sect were following behind them, still engaged in battle.The battle between Mu Jeong-jin and the Guhwasata left the street in ruins.The fight between the two different masters was enough to temporarily silence the confusion of Chengdu.Both of them excelled in martial arts, as they were representatives of Sichuan Province.Mu Jeong-jin is a great swordsman as he was a representative of the Qingcheng sect, and unlike the eccentric nature of the Guhwasata, he was also well versed and familiar with the martial arts of the Emei sect.Because of that, they couldn\u2019t win against each other immediately, and the fight became longer. So the damage caused in Chengdu was greater.This had to be a burden for both of them.In order to dominate Sichuan, the hegemony of Chengdu had to be obtained, but if the streets of Chengdu were destroyed in this way, the people\u2019s hearts had no choice but to turn their backs against them.The two tacitly agreed to move the battlefield.So they left Chengdu.The disciples of the Qingcheng and Emei sect naturally followed, while the rest of the nearby warriors moved to the battlefield as if possessed by something.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIs that\u2026?\u201dThe first thing that came into their eyes was the thread of qi that flashed in the dark.It was the Soul-Reaping Thread.The figure of the Soul-Reaping Thread moving vertically and horizontally was like the lamp of a lighthouse that guides ships in the dark sea. The faster it moved, the more bizarre the echoes that spread through the darkness.Hoo-woong! Hong!The bizarre sound of the Soul-Reaping Threads slicing the air attracted people\u2019s attention. Maybe the Soul-Reaping Thread contained magic that sucks people in.\u201cWho is that?\u201dYong Seol-ran was the first person to recognize Pyo-wol, who was wielding the Soul-Reaping Thread.A great disciple who was by her side asked,\u201cDo you know him?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s him. Pyo-wol!\u201d\u201cThat assassin?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe great disciple shouted loudly at Yong Seol-ran\u2019s answer.\u201cIt\u2019s Pyo-wol. That assassin is over there!\u201dHer cry reached not only the disciples of the Emei sect, but also the ears of Mu Jeong-jin.\u2018Assassin?\u2019Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s eyes involuntarily turned to Pyo-wol.In an instant, an intense glare emanated from his eyes. He recognized Pyo-wol\u2019s face buried in the darkness. The moment he looked at Pyo-Wol\u2019s face, the anger he had buried deep in his heart soared.\u201cYou bastard!\u201dIt was a face that he had never forgotten for the past seven years.The assassin that Mu Jeong-jin had put himself into the snake pit was dealing with the horsemen of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group with a sullen look.The moment he saw Pyo-wol, Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s reason flew away.\u201cYou\u2019re really alive!\u201dHe roared as his aura resounded through the night sky.\u201cKheuk! Gua\u2014\u201d\u201cHckkk!\u201dThe warriors with weak internal energy staggered as they covered their ears with both of their hands. After Mu Jeong-jin roared and raised his qi, their eardrums burst.That\u2019s how much internal energy Mu Jeong-jin possessed.\u00a0The culprit behind all these incidents was the Guhwasata, but it was Pyo-wol who directly killed Woo Gunsang.The anger towards the Guhwasata was then transferred to Pyo-wol.Chua-aang!Mu Jeong-jin swung his sword with all his might against Guhwasata.\u201cKeuck!\u201dThe intense shock that resonated throughout her body made Guhwasata step back. There were deep dents on her staff. If she had made a mistake, her weapon would have been cut into pieces.The lesions on her staff were the same as creating a scar on the pride of the Guhwasata. Guhwasata\u2019s eyes became more vicious.Mu Jeong-jin left the Guhwasata and flew towards Pyo-wol. It was only then that the Guhwasata discovered Pyo-wol, the culprit of all these incidents.\u201cCatch him!\u201dAt her command, an Emei sect\u2019s disciple rushed towards Pyo-wol.In an instant, Pyo-wol\u2019s lips rose in an arc.In front of him were Zhang Mu-ryang and the Black Cloud Troops while at his back were the leaders of the Qingcheng and Emei sect with their disciples.It was a dire situation.Still, Pyo-wol smiled.\u201cNow, everyone is gathered.\u201dThe main characters of the incident seven years ago have been reunited.For this moment, Pyo-wol did not leave the vicinity of Chengdu, but continued a bitter battle with the Black Cloud Mercenary Group.It was then that Zhang Mu-ryang realized that all of the events so far were what Pyo-wol intended.\u201cYou deliberately brought all of them together? You crazy bastard!\u201dHe became afraid of Pyo-wol.The decisiveness to do what everyone thought was crazy was scary. And Pyo-wol was a kind of human. He had never met someone like him before.Zhang Mu-ryang couldn\u2019t even imagine the extent of Pyo-wol\u2019s deviousness and cruelty that was hiding in his little head.Pyo-wol fled without looking back when the Mu Jeong-jin and Guhwasata rushed in.\u00a0Zhang Mu-ryang and the horsemen of the Black Cloud Mercenary Group tried to stop him, but they could not stop Pyo-wol from escaping when he used the Black Lightning.In the end, Zhang Mu-ryang and the horsemen failed to capture Pyo-wol like a dog chasing a chicken.\u201cDamn it! Chase him!\u201dZhang Mu-ryang urged the horsemen.He had to catch or remove Pyo-wol before their client, the Emei sect, does. Even though he knew that chasing Pyo-wol like this would be dangerous, he had no choice but to order the horsemen to pursue him.A chase followed Pyo-wol in an instant.The Black Cloud Mercenary Group, the Qingcheng sect, and the Emei sect ran at the forefront, followed by numerous warriors who had no knowledge of the true reason behind the fight or chase.In the middle of the night, a chase was taking place.\u00a0It was a reenactment of the inescapable net that caused an uproar in the entire Sichuan Province seven years ago.In the past, they used to spread a web-like entrapment from all sides to tighten the siege, but now it is different in that they were simply following one-sidedly.Pyo-wol was just running with them on his tail.A few quick-witted people noticed that Pyo-wol had done all this on purpose, but they were already caught up in the crowd\u2019s madness and couldn\u2019t do anything about it.\u201cBastard! How far are you planning to run?\u201dMu Jeong-jin\u2019s roar resounded in the night sky.He fired a formidable sword energy at Pyo-wol, but Pyo-wol dodged all his attacks by a few second intervals, as if he had eyes on the back of his head.Because of this, Mu Jeong-jin became even more angry as he pursued Pyo-wol.Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s eyes were already red and bloodshot, and he was radiating a creepy aura. Even Guhwasata who immediately followed behind him found him terrifying.\u00a0But Mu Jeong-jin himself wasn\u2019t aware of that at all.His eyes were just glued at the back of Pyo-wol.Like a pack of wolves chasing their prey, Mu Jeong-jin and the rest of the warriors tracked and chased after Pyo-wol. If they just stretched out their hands, it would seem that they can catch Pyo-wol at any moment, but they never caught him.Because of that, their sprint lasted almost half an hour.\u2018Are you luring us on purpose?\u2019Yong Seol-ran was the first to notice that something was wrong.\u201cWa, wait! We have to stop. If we continue following him, we will be doing what Pyo-wol intended.\u201d\u201cNoisy. You should stay quiet.\u201dYong Seol-ran\u2019s voice was buried in the whispers of the Guhwasata.\u00a0It was a stalemate situation where her self-esteem was hurt by being pushed by Mu Jeong-jin. She wanted to kill Pyo-wol as soon as possible and have a real match against Mu Jeong-jin.It had been a long time since the Guhwasata became so angry.\u201cHuuu\u2026\u201dYong Seol-ran let out a sigh at the sight of such a state of affairs. She already guessed that it was too late to stop Guhwasata.\u2018Pyo-wol.\u2019Yong Seol-ranlooked at the back of Pyo-wol, who was running in the lead.The look of his back running into the darkness felt particularly ominous. And her anxious forebodings became a reality.\u201cKerhyuk!\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dSuddenly, screams began to erupt from among the warriors.Yong Seol-ran looked up in surprise and saw that some of the warriors who were running blindly suddenly collapsed while screaming.\u201cHi, hidden weapons?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s hidden traps!\u201dThe warriors who were next to the fallen shouted urgently.At that moment, the warriors who had been chasing Pyo-wol frantically stopped in surprise.Mu Jeong-jin and Guhwasata, who were chasing Pyo-wol at the forefront, also felt that the situation was taking an unusual turn and stopped.They looked around, forgetting that they had fought fiercely until half an hour ago.Although it was a dark night, they could see the collapsed walls and the scattered pillars of light.Only then did they realize that this place was the ruins of a certain clan.\u201cTangjiatuo\u2026?\u201d\u201cDid he lure us to the ruins of the Tang Family?\u201dThe faces of the people who followed Pyo-wol, as well as Mu Jeong-jin and the Guhwasata, turned pale.Although it has already been destroyed and only ruins remain, the name of the Tang Family has a deep resonance that makes people\u2019s hearts uneasy.\u00a0Before the Qingcheng and the Emei sects, they ruled Sichuan with fear. They disappeared as remnants of history, but the remnants of fear they left behind still frightened people.Mu Jeong-jin exploded his internal energy.\u201cDamn! How dare you lure us to such an unlucky place! Why don\u2019t you show yourself?!\u201dAt that moment, Pyo-wol appeared in the middle of the Tangjiatuo.As if he had been there from the beginning, without sound or sign.Even in the dark, a particularly pure white face and red-tinged eyes stood out.This was the first time for most of the warriors to see the Pyo-wol.The moment they saw Pyo-wol, they felt a terrible chill.Pyo-wol looked at the soldiers and opened his mouth.\u201cThis is my inescapable net.\u201dHoped everyone enjoyed the chapter~ Don\u2019t forget to comment down below what you think of the chapter <3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 84": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 84Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe security network that covers both heaven and earth and is difficult to escape no matter how hard you struggle, is called the inescapable net.1Seven years ago, Pyo-wol and the other assassins of the Blood Shadow Group were trapped and hunted mercilessly by the warriors of Sichuan Province.They ran and ran to escape from the encirclement of the warriors, but in the end they died horribly.At that time, the warriors who participated in the inescapable net killed the children with the feeling that they were enjoying a light game. The children who had struggled to survive in the dark for seven years like that, died without seeing the light of the world.Many of the warriors who came to the Tang Family in pursuit of Pyo-wol had also participated in the inescapable net at that time.It was absolutely no coincidence.People\u2019s inclinations do not change easily, so those who participated in the inescapable net came to Chengdu to enjoy similar pleasures.It had already been seven years, but Pyo-wol remembered all the faces of the people he had met and passed by.Among the people who came to the Tang Family, the faces of those who participated in the inescapable net at the time were visible.He remembered them clearly, but on the contrary, they did not recognize him at all.Pyo-wol thought it didn\u2019t matter anyway.Because from now on, he would make sure they would never forget it.He will bring back memories of seven years ago.\u201cWhat bullshit are you talking about?\u201dA man with a quick temper rushed forward with great momentum.A man named Oh Joo-kyung was a well known warrior in the Xichang region, which is in the southern part of Sichuan Province.\u00a0However, his fame was limited to the Xichang area, and when viewed as a whole of Sichuan Province, he was nothing more than a disgraceful existence at the bottom of the pyramid.\u00a0So he always had a desire to make his fame spread all over Sichuan.Oh Joo-kyung thought this was a good opportunity. So, when others are hesitating because of their reluctant minds, he came forward with great momentum.A lot of people\u2019s eyes were focused on him.Oh Joo-kyung exclaimed in a loud voice.\u201cThis Oh Joo-kyung is going to cut your head off!\u201dHe took out his beloved sword and ran towards Pyo-wol.It was only a matter of time before he would spread his fame throughout Sichuan by taking Pyo-wol\u2019s life. So before the other warriors could take Pyo-wol\u2019s life, he had to make his move first.Oh Joo-kyung practiced his martial art with all his might.\u00a0But he had to stop before he could take ten steps.Cweaeac!Because there was a terrifying pounding sound.\u201cHidden weapons?\u201d2Oh Joo-kyung hurriedly swung his sword and blocked the front.Taang!Along with the chit sound, the hidden weapon was blocked and fell to the floor. Oh Joo-kyung, who felt cheated, shouted at Pyo-wol.\u201cHow\u2026\u201dBut his words ended there.It is because three hidden weapons fly towards him again.He barely managed to stop the first one, but the second one went through his shoulder, and the third one went deep into his stomach.\u201cKheuk!\u201dIn the end, Oh Joo-kyung collapsed without even going near Pyo-wol. He fell to the floor and was unable to move again.A fearful expression flashed on the faces of the warriors who saw it.It was not simply because Oh Joo-kyung lost his life because of the hidden weapons.Because the place where he died was the Tangjiatuo.In Sichuan, Tangjiatuo has a special meaning.Tangjiatuo was the site of the Tang Family, where their poison and hidden weapons were feared by the entire Jianghu.They had an underlying fear that some weapon and extreme poison might be hidden in the Tiangjiatuo was at the back of their minds. For this reason, people did not seek Tiangjiatuo, if possible, even after the death of the Tang Family.In such a situation, the fear of the warriors grew even more when Oh Joo-kyung died because of a hidden weapon.It was because they thought that Pyo-wol might have revived the Tang Family that had been sleeping in the Tangjiatuo.Their guess was half right and half wrong.There were no machinery or weapons in the Tangjiatuo. This is because when the Tang Family collapsed, all their facilities and visions were ruined.Instead, Pyo-wol had a Tang member.A man who inherited the vision of the Tang Family.When Pyo-wol was active in Chengdu, Tang Sochu mobilized all of his knowledge he had about the Tangjiatuo and set up all the hidden weapons and other machinery.Compared to the heyday of the Tang Family, it had less than one tenth of its power, but for Pyo-wol, that was enough.The power of machinery and hidden weapons, in the darkness where it made it difficult to see, was beyond imagination.Pupupuk!A sharp shattering sound ripped through the darkness and echoed.\u201cKkeuk!\u201d\u201cEveryone watch out!\u201dThe warriors were scattered all over.There was no unity or coherent system in their actions. This is because they were all warriors of different clans.As the chaos reached its peak, the damage was even greater.Only the disciples of the Qingcheng and Emei sect responded effectively, while the rest of the warriors moved recklessly to avoid the onslaught of hidden weapons.\u00a0As a result, the damage was even greater.\u201cYou devil!\u201dAt the unexpected situation, Guhwasata trembled all over.Screams echoed from all directions, and thousands of people died.\u00a0All of this happened because of one person.Many people ran to catch Pyo-wol, but before they could do so, they were attacked by hidden weapons and fell down.As time passed, the damage grew exponentially.They never expected to experience such a thing in the Tangjiatuo.\u201cHeuk! Save me!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to be here anymore!\u201dThere were a lot of people screaming and running away.Their fear reached the climax, in addition to their fear of the name of the Tang Family, they were also attacked by their signature hidden weapons.Pyo-wol did not dare to pursue the fleeing one. Because he had no room for them, and they were not his real goal.In the end, his goal was Guhwasata.\u201cI will tear your jaws apart and kill you.\u201dGuhwasata led the Emei disciples to attack Pyo-wol. At that moment, Pyo-wol blew a long whistle.Ciiii!A whistling sound, like the sound of a snake\u2019s breath, spread far and wide. Immediately after that, the Emei sect\u2019s disciples burst out in screams.\u201cAaack!\u201d\u201cWhat is this?\u201dDisciples suddenly fell one after another.\u201cIt\u2019s a snake! The bushes are full of snakes!\u201d\u201cEveryone, watch out!\u201dIt was only after a dozen or so of her disciples fell down in an instant, that they found out that it was a snake.It wasn\u2019t just the Emei disciples.Many warriors still remaining in Tangjiatuo were bitten by the snakes and fell.\u201cWatch out everyone! He uses his magic to control snakes!\u201dGuhwasata swung her staff and slashed the approaching snake and shouted.Fear appeared on the faces of the Emei warriors. They couldn\u2019t even guess how many snakes were hiding in Tangjiatuo. They didn\u2019t even know what Pyo-wol was using to control those snakes.It was true that Pyo-wol spread the inescapable net.After the fall of the Tang family, Tangjiatuo became a habitat for snakes. The snakes living there were the last feature of Pyo-wol\u2019s inescapable net.Guhwasata wanted to attack Pyo-wol, but saving her disciples was her priority.Pyo-wol looked at the situation and smiled lightly.\u201cI will finally get to kill you.\u201dHis gaze turned to the swordsman who was approaching him.Mu Jeong-jin was walking through the bushes.The snake\u2019s attack didn\u2019t work for Mu Jeong-jin. It was because the snakes were reluctant to approach the momentum emanating from his body.Mu Jeong-jin did not give a single glance even when a Qingcheng disciple was attacked by a snake.He only aimed to kill Pyo-wol.Even in the dark, Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s eyes shone eerily. It was as if fire was burning in both eyes. Pyo-wol narrowed his eyes and looked at Mu Jeong-jin.Just as Mu Jeong-jin remembers him, Pyo-wol remembers Mu Jeong-jin clearly.The man who threw himself into a snake pit.This gave him the ability to act like a snake, but the pain Pyo-wol suffered at that time was not something that humans could dare to bear. Pyo-wol still remembered the pain of that time clearly.Shreung!Mu Jeong-jin approached Pyo-wol and drew his sword.Like a swordsman representing Sichuan, a formidable energy emanated from Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s whole body.Puppupuck!The head of the snakes nearby exploded at the energy he radiated.Mu Jeong-jin said while pointing his sword at the table.\u201cBecause of you, the wings of the Qingcheng sect were broken. You will have to pay the price with your life.\u201d\u201cWhat price? There\u2019s nothing in this world that I\u2019ll pay any more.\u201dHe was imprisoned in darkness for a whopping seven more years in return for killing Woo Gunsang. When he was dumped into a pit full of snakes, Pyo-wol was dead.There was nothing more to pay.There is only debt to be paid.Sreung!As Pyo-wol stretched out his arms, the ghost dagger that was hung at the end of the Soul-Reaping Thread shook.He had no intention of wasting any more time.While the others lost all their nerves to hidden weapons and snakes, he had to deal with Mu Jeong-jin.Suiit!Pyo-wol disappeared into the darkness.It was as if his existence had been erased from the world.\u00a0He used Black Lightning that played around with the warriors of the Black Cloud Corps. They had lost a number of troops because they couldn\u2019t catch the movement of Pyo-wol even with their eyes wide open.However, Mu Jeong-jin was on a different level from the warriors from the Black Cloud Corps.\u201cYou\u2019re playing such a trick. Heh!\u201dHe was dressed coolly and drew his sword in the right direction. A strong sword blazed from his sword and crossed the space.Kaang!In an instant, Pyo-wol appeared.Surprisingly, it was the first time the Black Lightning was blocked.Pyo-wol\u2019s waist would have been cut in half if it had not been for the ghost dagger that blocked the sword of Mu Jeong-jin.However, even though the Black Lightning was blocked, Pyo-wol\u2019s expression did not change at all.No one could read what he was thinking just by looking at his face. It was the same with Mu Jeong-jin\u00a0 who attacked.Mu Jeong-jin shouted as he executed the Qingcheng\u2019s Sect Red Cloud Sword3\u00a0towards Pyo-wol.\u201cIt\u2019s no use pretending to be calm. No matter what you do, you won\u2019t be able to deceive me!\u201dSususuc!His sword caused a change in the air.It looked like it was going to rip the surface of Pyo-wol at any moment as it slashed through the black darkness with intense black energy.\u00a0However, his black streak was deflected by Pyo-wol.The Black Lightning might have been blocked, but Pyo-wol still had the Snake Steps.Like a wiggling snake, Pyo-wol evaded all attacks from Mu Jeong-jin. At the same time, he wielded the Soul-Reaping Thread.Ciiit!At the end of the Soul-Reaping Thread, two ghost daggers hung and attacked Mu Jeong-jin.\u201cHeh! That\u2019s pretty good.\u201dMu Jeong-jin snorted and unleashed the Qingcheng swordsmanship.Tadadadang!The sound of heavy weapons hitting an iron plate broke out countless times between the two.It was the sound of the ghost dagger and the swords of Mu Jeong-jin.The ghost dagger was wriggling like a living serpent, aiming for Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s life. It also served as a shield to block all of the attacks of Mu Jeong-jin.For the first time, a light of admiration appeared on Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s face.He had ignored and treated him as a lowly assassin before, but Pyo-wol\u2019s technique was sharper and more terrifying than the martial arts of any prestigious sects.If he showed even a small gap, the ghost dagger seemed to dig in.Mu Jeong-jin felt an extreme sense of crisis.This was the first time he had felt such a strong sense of crisis, having reigned invincible in Sichuan for decades.He felt a shiver all over his body.The strong sense of crisis awakened his desire to win.Chaat!Mu Jeong-jin performed the Qingcheng Sect\u2019s Thirteen Swords,4\u00a0the secret swordsmanship of the Qingcheng sect.Of course, it did not contain the swordsmanship that could be unleashed by a master at their peak. Even so, people felt a chilling chill the moment Mu Jeong-jin unfolded the \u2018Thirteen Swords\u2019.It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the power of the sword is maximized when the energy is exposed outwardly like a sword energy. The Thirteenth Swords of the Qingcheng sect exerts its maximum power by placing a formidable energy inside the sword.It looks plain on the outside, but inside, it contains a formidable force.Cwaaac!Like a meteor that cuts through the night sky, the sword of Mu Jeong-jin slid towards Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol felt goosebumps rising all over his body.It was because he could feel how intense the power was contained in Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s blow. But he didn\u2019t feel afraid.Pyo-wol flew towards Mu Jeong-jin.His figure was engulfed in darkness.Again, the Black Lightning was unleashed.\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you it\u2019s useless?\u201dMu Jeong-jin swung his sword towards the place where the flow of qi was violently fluctuating.Sugagak!Mu Jeong-jin had no doubts that he could kill Pyo-wol with this one blow. He could already imagine Pyo-wol splitting in two with his sword.That was then.Tuck!There was a sound different from what Mu Jeong-jin had expected.His sword was blocked by something.Surprisingly, it was Pyo-wol\u2019s finger that blocked his sword.He had stopped the formidable qi contained in the sword of Mu Jeong-jin, who said that there was nothing that his sword could not cut.An incredulous look could be seen in his eyes.\u201cYou, you?\u201dBlood stains appeared on the corner of Pyo-wol\u2019s mouth.He suffered quite a few internal injuries from the impact of the Qingcheng Sect\u2019s Thirteen Swords. Even so, his complexion did not change.One candle is enough to illuminate the deep darkness.\u00a0[\uc870\uc591\ud751\uc554(\u7167\u4eae\u9ed2\u6697) \uc77c\ucd09\ud654(\u4e00\u8680\u706b).]It is enough for a firm mind to go through the darkness before me.\u00a0[\uc544\uc804\ud751\uc554(\u6211\u524d\u9ed1\u6697) \uc871\ub2e8\uc2ec(\u8db3\u4e39\u5fc3).]One candle is enough to light the deep darkness,\u00a0One hard heart is enough to get through the darkness in front of him.No matter how great the sword was with its formidable energy, there is nothing that cannot be destroyed by gathering the Black Lightning at one point.Mysterious Ghost Break.5Jjooeng!Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s sword, which collided with Pyo-wol\u2019s finger, cracked like a spider\u2019s web and exploded.\u2026istg translating techniques is the most difficult part.

    "Chapter 85": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 85Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe fragments of the broken sword flew in all directions.\u00a0\u201cKeuk!\u201dMu Jeong-jin let out an embarrassed groan.Several broken shards were lodged in his forearm. No physical wounds could cause him any pain.What made him sick is that his beloved sword was smashed by a single finger of Pyo-wol.It was a sword he inherited from his master.It was a sword he was supposed to pass down to his next disciple.It was a famous sword that boasted a level of perfection that hardly needed to be repaired even if it was passed down from generation to generation.The fact that such a famous sword was completely destroyed by Pyo-wol\u2019s one finger gave him a great psychological blow. And Pyo-wol did not miss the gap.As Mu Jeong-jin was staggering, Pyo-wol took advantage of the moment and threw a ghost dagger.Two ghost daggers flew in different trajectories.With the ghost dagger that digs into loopholes like a viper, Mu Jeong-jin forgot about his face and spread his qi. Just like a lazy donkey that rolls on the floor, Mu Jeong-jin rolled on the floor and hurriedly escaped from the barrage of attacks of the ghost daggers.The face of Mu Jeong-jin, who raised his body, was filled with a disappointing light.He hurriedly raised his qi and tried to prepare for Pyo-wol\u2019s attack.Puuc!At that moment, he felt a burning pain in his back.Mu Jeong-jin looked back with his mouth wide open with the unexpected pain. Then he saw the face of an old woman with deep wrinkles.\u201cGuhwa\u2026sata?\u201dIt was the Emei sect\u2019s Guhwasata that took advantage of the chaos and attacked Mu Jeong-jin.She had stabbed a dagger in the back of Mu Jeong-jin.While dealing with the snakes and hidden weapons, the Guhwasata took the opportunity to intervene in the fight between Pyo-wol and Mu Jeong-jin. Then, when Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s attention was taken away and his weaknesses were revealed, she boldly attacked them.She smiled as she looked at Mu Jeong-jin who was astonished by the situation.\u201cGood job, Mu Jeong-jin! From now on, I will take over that assassin.\u201d\u201cThis cowardly\u2013\u201d\u201cHeh! So what if I did a sneak attack, or a surprise attack? Jianghu only remembers the victors.\u201dMu Jeong-jin\u2019s face was distorted even more horribly at the remarks of the Guhwasata.\u201cHow could a sect leader of the Emei sect think like that\u2026Emei\u2019s honor will fall to the ground because of you.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care about my honor right now. In the end, Emei\u00a0 will be the final winner and will rule Sichuan. In that case, who would dare to curse in front of me? In the end, history only honors and remembers the victors..\u201dGuhwasata calmly answered.From the time she planned to assassinate Woo Gunsang seven years ago, Guhwasata had already thrown her honor on the floor.What she really wanted was the revival of the Emei faction, and for this to happen, she had to destroy the Qingcheng sect.Mu Jeong-jin was the largest pillar supporting the Qingcheng sect. The golden opportunity to break down such a pillar came, and there was no reason for her to hesitate.\u00a0Even if she were to be insulted by the former warriors of Sichuan for this reason and that the honor of the Emei sect was lowered to the ground.\u201cYou devil! Because of you, the Emei sect will decline.\u201d\u201cBefore that, worry about the Qingcheng sect.\u201dBang!Guhwasata struck Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s chest with her staff. Mu Jeong-jin flew about a dozen or more and tossed on the floor with a hole on his chest.\u201cMaster!\u201d\u201cDamn it!\u201dThe Qingcheng Seven Swords tried to run towards the Mu Jeong-jin, but the warriors of the Emei sect clinged to them.\u201cHeh! That\u2019s great.\u201dGuhwasata came to Pyo-wol with a snort.\u201cI have a little bit of gratitude for you. Thanks to you, I was able to get this opportunity.\u201dThe existence of Pyo-wol was both bad and good news for the Guhwasata.A war broke out with the Qingcheng sect because he assassinated Woo Gunsang, but she was able to solidify the position of the Emei sect. She was able to get rid of Mu Jeong-jin today because he was distracted.Mu Jeong-jin is a tycoon that accounts for more than half of the Qingcheng sect\u2019s power. Having removed such a giant, the Emei could take the lead in the future war against the Qingcheng sect.\u201cIn return, I will kill you painlessly.\u201dHoo-hung!The staff in the hands of Guhwasa burst out. It was a phenomenon that occurred while she injected all of her internal energy.Pyo-wol looked at the situation with his eyes narrowed.Had it not been for his ambition, he would have just wandered the world and lived as nothing.An ordinary life.Or he may have passed away miserably somewhere.Because Jianghu is terribly cold-hearted to a bastard who has nothing.The ambitions of the Guhwasata have made him who he is today.Pyo-wol, the assassin.A monster that does not blink an eye even though he is surrounded by countless warriors.Now it was his turn to show how ferocious and terrifying the monster she had created.Pyo-wol spread his Black Lightning and rushed towards the Guhwasata.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dGuhwasata carefully observed Pyo-wol as he was busy fighting Mu Jeong-jin. So she was able to prepare for the Black Lightning.Hoo-woong!In the case of the Guhwasata, her Golden Light Sword method was pointed toward the place where qi had fluctuated.The Golden Light Sword method was a technique that hits the opponent a dozen times in one breath by covering her staff with qi.\u00a0Since it was not a direct hit to her staff, there was no fear of her weapon being destroyed by Pyo-wol\u2019s bizarre technique.Ciit!At that moment, a sharp cracking sound resounded in the darkness, and a weapon came out.It was the ghost dagger.\u201cHuh!\u201dGuhwasata was startled by the sudden appearance of a dagger and bowed her head. She thought she had already escaped Pyo-wol\u2019s attack, but there wasn\u2019t just one dagger.Cisit!One after another, a sharp piercing sound echoed in the darkness, and ghost daggers were continuously emitted.In the end, the Guhwasata had no choice but to slash the dagger by wielding her staff that was intended to spread the Golden Light Sword method.Jjalgrung!The dagger that threatened her life was thrown out in all directions.\u201cDo you think this is enough?\u201dGuhwasata laughed at Pyo-yol.\u00a0But she didn\u2019t know.In the midst of the ghost daggers being deflected, the Soul-Reaping Thread was making its way around her ankles like a snake.The ghost daggers that were released earlier were nothing more than a bait to divert the focus and attention of the Guhwasata.\u00a0He created a lasso with the Soul-Reaping Thread, and released the ghost daggers to lure her towards it.Bang!When Pyo-wol pulled Soul-Reaping Thread, Guhwasata shook greatly.\u201cHuh!\u201dWith the unexpected situation, Guhwasang was terrified and tried to regain her balance quickly. It was only for a very short period of time that she showed her weakness.But for Pyo-wol, that was enough.Pyo-wol once again executed the Black Lightning and advanced.When theBlack Lightning was added to the heart, his speed doubled.Pyo-wol clenched his fists and shortened the gap between the two of them, with a speed close to the speed of sound that the human eye could never detect.The weight of Pyo-wol was added to the tremendous speed. Pyo-wol himself has become a weapon with tremendous destructive power.Guhwasata widened her eyes.Instinctively, she sensed the leap. But before she could even react, Pyo-wol slammed his fist into her stomach.Poeng!\u201cKkeuk!\u201dGuhwasata bounced back with the sound of a blast bomb exploding.Guhwasata\u2019s face was covered in blood as she rolled on the floor.A look of astonishment flashed across her face.It was because both her insides and heart vein were shaken by that one attack of Pyo-wol.On her hands was a broken staff.Just before Pyo-wol\u2019s attack exploded, the Guhwasata blocked the front with her superhuman reflexes and staff. However, he was not able to completely defend against the attack of Pyo-wol.One of the toughest weapons in the world, her staff broke in the middle, and she herself suffered massive internal injuries. The pain as if her whole body was dismantled overtook her.For the first time, a light of fear appeared on Guhwasata\u2019s face.\u201cSeol-ran, Captain of the Black Cloud Corps! Get him!\u201dShe ordered her disciple and Jang Muryang to work together. It was a cowardly act, but there was no time to scrutinize this or that. The most important thing at this moment was preserving her own life.Even if her honor fell to the floor, it could be restored as long as she is still alive.She tried to save her own life, even at the cost of Yong Seol-ran and Jang Muryang.\u00a0But Pyo-wol had no intention of letting her go.It was a relief that Guhwasata managed to be lured away from Mt. Emei. If he missed her like this, he didn\u2019t know when an opportunity like this would come again.Pyo-wol rushed towards the Guhwasata.\u201cBastard!\u201dJang Muryang, who was nearby, came out. Jang Muryang attacked Pyo-wol by using the Jangga Chang method.At that moment, Pyo-wol swung his ghost dagger with the Soul-Reaping Thread. The Soul-Reaping Thread wrapped around his spear like a viper and climbed up.\u201cHuh!\u201dJang Muryang was astonished.He had to throw away the spear to get rid of the Soul-Reaping Thread. However, his pride did not allow him to discard the spear.While he was hesitating, the ghost dagger that was hanging from the Soul-Reaping Thread was shot at an invisible speed.Puk!The ghost dagger was impaled on Jang Muryang\u2019s right chest. Jang Muryang collapsed, bleeding from his chest, but Pyo-wol didn\u2019t pay him any attention and ran towards the Guhwasata instead.\u201cStop!\u201dYong Seol-ran swung her sword to stop Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol did not dodge, but raised his arm and was hit by Yong Seol-ran\u2019s sword. Yong Seol-ran\u2019s sword penetrated almost half of his forearm.Flesh cracked and blood splattered, but Pyo-wol\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change.Yong Seol-ranflinched for a moment because she didn\u2019t expect that Pyo-wol would receive the attack with his bare body. Pyo-wol did not miss the gap and passed by her using the Snake Steps.Pyo-wol, who passed the two of them in an instant, reached the front of the Guhwasata.\u201cNo\u2026!\u201dGuhwasang shouted until her throat was about to burst, but her body remained stiff like a frog in front of a snake. The moment she saw Pyo-wol\u2019s red eyes, Guhwasata felt extremely afraid.Guhwasata had a vision of a huge snake of great size swallowing herself with its mouth wide open.Surgerc!At that moment, a sharp cutting sound resounded from Guhwasata\u2019s neck.A ghost dagger passed through her neck.\u201cKekkeuk!\u201dFrom the mouth of Guhwasata, a sound as if the air was being blown out. She touched her neck with her hand. Her palms were wet.Red blood trickled down between her fingers.\u201cI, I can\u2019t die. My supremacy over Sichuan is not far away\u2026\u201dGuhwasata trembled.She was the only woman who devoted herself to see the revival of the Emei sect. Now that her goal is not far away, she could not accept the fact that she would be losing her life to a mere assassin.\u201cYou evil bastard! If it weren\u2019t for you\u2026\u201dGuhwasata reached out and tried to catch Pyo-wol.\u00a0But her hand did not reach Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol stared at Guhwasata\u2019s eyes and said,\u201cNow you\u2019re out of my life.\u201d\u201cKerhyuk!\u201dGuhwasa collapsed, with blood falling down her mouth.\u201cMaster!\u201d\u201cSect leader!\u201dThe Emei\u2019s disciples came running, crying out after seeing the situation. They were all scared and confused.\u00a0The death of Guhwasata, whom they highly regarded like the heavens, was hardly realistic.\u201cThat crazy bastard!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not human!\u201dThe warriors who saw the collapse of Guhwasata were terrified.Pyo-wol, standing tall, covered in the blood of the Guhwasata, did not look like a human at all.All of a sudden, the machineries stopped, and the hidden weapons were no longer fired. Still, the warriors did not dare to attack Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol, covered in blood with his glowing red eyes, had a very overwhelming presence.\u201cWhere did such a star of death\u2013\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s the grim reaper. He harvests soul\u2026\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201dThose who were weak in spirit felt extreme fear just by looking at Pyo-wol. Some of them even unknowingly peed.\u2018This is bad! Everyone is being overwhelmed by him.\u2019Yong Seol-ran\u2019s eyes shook.Hundreds or thousands of martial artists were overwhelmed by the presence of just one man.They were overpowered by that very same assassin they had so despised.It was too unrealistic to be immobilized by a single assassin.If all these people rush in at once, there\u2019s a chance they will survive. But no one came forward.Yong Seol-ran had a gut feeling that a new ruler had been established in Sichuan.A reaper who rules with blood and fear.Then something happened that no one expected.Someone stood up behind Yong Seol-ran where no one was paying attention.\u00a0It was a warrior staring at Pyo-wol with his eyes eaten by madness.\u201cHeh heh heh!\u201dA roar echoed in the battlefield.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 86": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 86Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cKeuk!\u201d\u201cHyuk!\u201dAfter the roar of Mu Jeong-jin, many warriors stumbled and had their eardrums ruptured. There were more than thousands of warriors who had blood flowing out of their ears.If it were the normal Mu Jeong-jin, he wouldn\u2019t have exploded his qi so ruthlessly. No matter how arrogant he is and how he tends to look at everything around him as trivial, he was still an elder of the prestigious Qingcheng sect.But now, at a glance, it could be seen that Mu Jeong-jin was not in his normal state.Madness was overflowing in his eyes, and an unusual momentum was radiating off of him. He had a unique appearance that made anyone feel goosebumps just looking at him.Even the Qingcheng Seven Swords made a surprised expression at the unusual appearance of Mu Jeong-jin.Pyo-wol looked at Mu Jeong-jin with his eyes narrowed.Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s chest that had been beaten earlier by Guhwasata was still dented. No matter how Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s martial arts reached a high level, he should not be able to move with his state.Everyone thought that was common sense.\u00a0But Mu Jeong-jin was going beyond everyone\u2019s common sense.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cMu Jeong-jin\u2019s aura is so ominous\u2026\u201dThey felt a turbid and ominous energy, that it was hard to believe that it was radiating from one of the elders of the prestigious Qingcheng sect.At some point, Mu Jeong-jin thought that his personality was changing.He used to be cold-hearted and more rational than anyone else but he ended up turning into a hot-tempered person. Back then, even if there was something he didn\u2019t like, he could still control his anger.But a change occurred after reading a booklet he accidentally found in an underground cave seven years ago.The Nine-Demon Style.One of the thirteen tribes of the demon sect that made Jianghu tremble in fear in the old days. The booklet he obtained contained the spirit of the Nine-Demon Style.The booklet he read out of curiosity left a seed of heart demon in him.As time passed, the seeds of the heart demon bloomed, and it was already too late by the time Mu Jeong-jinn noticed it.In order to escape the curse of the Nine-Demon Style, he had no choice but to let go of his previous martial arts. However, it was not easy to abandon the martial arts that he had been struggling to hone for decades.Moreover, Mu Jeong-jin had the title of being the best warrior of the Qingcheng sect. He did not have the confidence to abandon his reputation by shutting down his own martial arts.He slowly fell deeply into the Nine-Demon Style.For him, who has only learned the martial arts of the Qingcheng sect all his life, the martial arts of the Nine-Demon Style opened up a new world.Rather, he felt cleaner, so he didn\u2019t know if he was contaminated by sorcery.The attack of the Guhwasata left Mu Jeong-jin in a moribund state. As his control was lost, the inner work of the Nine-Demon Style, which had been suppressed so far, began to work.The inner work of the Nine-Demon Style was different from the general martial art of the regular orthodox sects.The reason why Mu Jeong-jin was still able to move despite having a depression on his chest was thanks to the strength of the Nine-Demon Style.A black ominous energy was flowing around Mu Jeong-jin.\u201cIs it possible that Mu Jeong-jin learned sorcery?\u201d\u201cHow can an elder of the Qingcheng do sorcery?\u201dThe warriors murmured with astonishment.Even though they said they were inferior to Mu Jeong-jin, they were also strong people who went through different kinds of things from birth. They had a keen eye enough to recognize sorcery.When the situation became like this, the group that was most perplexed was the Qingcheng Seven Swords.\u201cMaster\u2026\u201d\u201cStop it, Master!\u201dThey asked Mu Jeong-jin to stop acting. However, Mu Jeong Jin-in did not turn his head even once and just went straight to Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol thought that the momentum radiating from Mu Jeong-jin somehow resembled him. He thought that there might be a connection because of the snakes.This is because Pyo-wol fell into the snake pit and naturally accepted the snake\u2019s habits, and the Nine-Demon School collected snakes and studied sorcery.The Nine-Demon Style invaded the brain of Mu Jeong-jin and took away his sanity. Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s eyes could only see Pyo-wol.He picked up a sword that was rolling on the floor.\u201cK\u2026ill.\u201dPhat!Mu Jeong-jin smashed the ground.\u00a0Ciiit!The sword of Mu Jeong-jin has slashed Pyo-wol with a force like a storm. Pyo-wol stepped back using Snake Step. But Mu Jeong-jin continued pursuing Pyo-wol.As Pyo-wol stepped back, Mu Jeong-jin would rush forward.The difference in speed between the two was obvious.Mu Jeong-jin might be an experienced fighter. But he still couldn\u2019t catch up.It was because of Pyo-wol\u2019s Snake Steps.\u00a0Ciat!Pyo-wol spread his hands wide. Then, a ghost dagger hanging from the Soul-Reaping Thread was shot aiming at Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s neck.\u00a0But Mu Jeong-jin was never an easy opponent. He struck the ghost dagger simply by swinging his sword lightly.Although Mu Jeong-jin was eroded by madness, his movements were much faster than normal and he had no openings. It was probably because he had already experienced first-hand the prowess of the ghost dagger and Soul-Reaping Thread.Mu Jeong-jin attacked Pyo-wol with the sword attack of the Qingcheng sect. In response, Pyo-wol wielded the ghost dagger.Giiing!The ghost dagger hanging from the Soul-Reaping Thread attacked Mu jeong-jin like two dragons swimming in the sky.Kakakang!Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s sword and Pyo-wol\u2019s ghost dagger collided countless times.People couldn\u2019t take their eyes off of their battle.\u201cIs that really the movements of a single assassin?\u201d\u201cThe assassin is as strong as the best swordsman of the Qingcheng sect.\u201dThe warriors were at a loss for words due to Pyo-wol\u2019s formidable strength.Pyo-wol thought that this was a turning moment.\u00a0It was only a few years ago that he established Aguido. He created Aguido by mixing the realizations he had gained while living with snakes and various miscellaneous martial arts, but he did not know what its true limit was.Aguido is not yet a complete martial art.He was just at the starting line.He had to know the limits of how far he could play against the best warrior of the Qingcheng sect with such a martial art. That was the reason why Pyo-wol confronted Mu Jeong-jin head-on.It was to challenge his limits.A battle to gauge the limits of his existence and to move forward beyond the barriers that stand in his way.The fight against Mu Jeong-jin had such a deep meaning to Pyo-wol.He has already clashed head-to-head with Mu Jeong-jin dozens of times.It was then that Pyo-wol was convinced.\u2018My fourteen years were not in vain.\u2019He has spent half of his life in deep darkness. By investing those long years, Pyo-wol was reborn. He will never go back to those miserable days again.The red eyes of Pyo-wol deepened even more.Mu Jeong-jin, who was influenced by the Nine-Demon Style, became stronger and more difficult to deal with.\u00a0So the way Pyo-wol needed to react had to change as well. The speed at which Pyo-wol thinks has increased.He entered the world of thunder. In that state, the Black Lightning was unleashed.Mu Jeong-jin looked for the area where qi would fluctuate.\u00a0\u201cHmpf.\u201dMu Jeong-jin swung his sword toward the left.If it\u2019s black lightning, he has already seen it. So, even in the state of him losing reason, it was possible to roughly infer the direction from the change of the qi.Cwahahak!The formidable energy of the Nine-Demon School was put on the sword. A black and cloudy energy was emitted.\u201cS, sword energy?\u201d\u201cOh God!\u201dThe warriors were astonished.Although it was turbid, what Mu Jeong-jin unfolded was clearly sword energy. Among the warriors of Sichuan, Mu Jeong-jin was the first to show his sword energy in front of warriors.People were shocked and thrilled.They had no doubts that Mu Jeong-jin would cut down Pyo-wol at once. Because the power of such sword energy was absolute.The problem was after that.No one other than Pyo-wol would dare go against Mu Jeong-jinIt was self-evident that the damage would increase like a snowball if Mu Jeong-jin, who is currently spreading his sword energy, ran wild.Still, the people did not intend to escape.They knew that their life could be in danger if they stayed. But, they were more curious about how the fight between Pyo-wol and Mu Jeong-jin would end.Warriors tended to be reckless, enough for them to risk their lives to satisfy even their slightest curiosity. But this time it went too far.Hoo-woong!Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s sword cut the space where Pyo-wol is expected to appear. Everything ended up being cut by the power of Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s sword.But Pyo-wol was nowhere to be found.When a light of suspicion appeared on Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s face, Pyo-wol suddenly popped out of nowhere.\u00a0Pyo-wol changed his trajectory using Black Lightning.\u00a0While the unimaginable speed makes a lot of things possible, it puts a huge stress on his body. For that reason, Pyo-wol had no choice but to initially use and maneuver the Black Lightning only through a straight line.\u00a0However, linear movements can be quickly read by masters of a high level such as Mu Jeong-jin or Guhwasata.So, Pyo-wol decided to add a curve to his movement.He had modified his technique to make it completely unpredictable by the other party. As a consequence, a greater burden was placed on his body.\u00a0However, Pyo-wol believed in his own capacity to endure such a burden.The price of the experiment he took was sweet.Puk!A ghost dagger was deeply embedded in Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s side.Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s face was contorted with pain.Even though he was ruled by madness, he could still feel the pain.\u201cAHH!\u201dMu Jeong-jin screamed and swung his sword towards Pyo-wol.\u00a0But Pyo-wol was already gone.He had again used Black Lightning to move to another place.\u00a0Every time he moves, a remnant of his figure remains, as if he did not move in the first place. In an instant, it was as if Pyo-wol had multiplied.Pupupuk!A sharp firing sound rang out. And after a while, the movement of the Pyo-wol stopped.He was staring at Mu Jeong-jin from a distance.\u201cAh!\u201d\u201cH, how?\u201dA sigh mixed with despair erupted from the mouths of the people who saw Mu Jeong-jin. In Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s bloodied body, there were about a dozen ghost daggers embedded making him look like a hedgehog.Grreuk!A rough sound came out of Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s mouth.Even for Mu Jeong-jin who had gained explosive power through the Nine-Demon Style,\u00a0 he could not survive being stabbed with a dozen or so daggers on his body.Pyo-wol\u2019s dagger was blocking the source of the Nine-Demon Style\u2019s magical energy from revitalizing Mu Jeong-jin.Vitality quickly disappeared from Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s face. As his vitality faded, so was the madness that had dominated him. Mu Jeong-jin looked at Pyo-wol with an expression of disbelief.\u201cI, to this assassin one day\u2026\u201dThat was then.\u201cSenior Brother Mu Jeong-jin!\u201dWith an angry voice, someone flew towards Mu Jeong-jin.It was a warrior who wore clothes similar to those of Mu Jeong-jin. He was a Muhwajin, a fellow brother of Mu Jeong-jin.Muhwajin embraced Mu Jeong-jin who collapsed. Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s breathing was on the verge of stopping. Muhwajin could only look at Mu Jeong-jin in his arms with sad eyes.\u201cWhy did you learn such sorcery?\u201dAll their questions were answered. How come Mu Jeong-jin became so violent?Mu Jeong-jin held Muhwajinin\u2019s hand with difficulty and said,\u201cEverything was for the sake of the Qingcheng sect.\u201dThose were the last words left by Mu Jeong-jin.\u201cFoolish\u2026\u201dMuhwajin was unable to continue his words.Mu Jeong-jin did not regret his decision until his death. However, his foolish decision put the Qingcheng sect in great trouble.\u00a0The gazes of the warriors looking at the disciples of the Qingcheng sect were unusual. They all watched as Mu Jeong-jin fell into madness. It was now impossible to shut their mouths.As a result, the reputation of the Qingcheng sect fell to the ground.It was the same with the Emei sect.Guhwasata attacked Mu Jeong-jin in front of everyone.\u00a0To think the sect leader of such a prestigious sect such as Emei would do something so cowardly that even other warriors would not do. It was an act that they could not make excuses for.\u00a0Guhwasata thought she could become the winner in that way, but in the end, she even lost her life to Pyo-wol.It was now the responsibility of the Emei warriors to take charge. But the Emei warriors could only stare at the Pyo-wol. No one was able to move.Pyo-wol was a highly skilled warrior.He was a ridiculous monster that devoured two of the best members of the Emei and Qingcheng sect alone. If it were just those two, the disciples of the Emei and Qingcheng sects would have clenched their teeth and attacked.But Pyo-wol killed not only the Guhwasata and Mu Jeong-jin, but also numerous other warriors.\u00a0In the process, Pyo-wol\u2019s mysterious martial arts brought great fear to the warriors.Pyo-wol was not just a poor prey caught in a net. Rather, it was the warriors who were caught in his inescapable net.The warriors looked at Pyo-wol without daring to take a deep breath.Pyo-wol had a strong presence that dominated the atmosphere of the battlefield.At least, that was how he was reflected in the eyes of the warriors.Muhwajin sighed softly.Because he didn\u2019t even know how to deal with the situation. There were still the disciples from the Qingcheng sect\u2019s Seven Swords and the Law Enforcement Hall.He wasn\u2019t sure if they could kill Pyo-wol even if he mobilized all of them, but it was clear that there would be a huge price to pay.As Muhwajin was busy debating over whether to take their revenge or not, Yong Seol-ran came forward.Yong Seol-ran said to Pyo-wol.\u201cPyo\u2026 If the great warrior permits it, the Emei sect would like to take the remains of our sect leader back to Mount Emei.\u201dFor a moment, the disciples of the Emei sect protested.\u201cHow could you ask permission from the person who killed our sect leader?\u201d\u201cWe must take revenge!\u201dBut the eyes of Yong Seol-ran looking at them were cold.\u201cHow? What are you going to do against the man who our sect leader and Mu Jeong-jin cannot do anything against?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201d\u201cNow is not the time to think about revenge, but the time to worry about our own survival.\u201dYong Seol-ran\u2019s voice snapped back the Emei disciples to the reality of their situation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 87": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 87Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayNo one from the Emei sect could dispute Yong Seol-ran\u2019s words.Her words reminded the Emei disciples of the reality of their situation.The sect leader of Emei cowardly attacked a warrior of the Qingcheng sect and was killed. At that moment, the Emei sect\u2019s reputation had fallen to the ground.\u00a0Everyone had lost their respect for the Emei sect. That includes the sects who have previously cooperated with them.The Emei sect had lost their justification to get their revenge against Pyo-wol.The warriors of Jianghu are obsessed with having a just cause.There are cases where a warrior, who had lost everything, would get up again with the help of those around him because the warrior had a good reason. There were also other cases however, where a warrior would lose everything while pursuing his work with unreasonable ambition without a\u00a0 justifiable cause.In the case of the Emei sect, they were the latter.They now have a crush on the Qingcheng sect, and have even lost the trust of the Sichuan warriors. No matter how great their force was,\u00a0 they could not survive if they turned all of the Sichuan warriors into their enemies.It was the same with the Qingcheng sect.When it was revealed that Mu Jeong-jin had mastered sorcery, the Qingcheng sect lost its justification for revenge.This is also the reason why even if Muhwajin wanted to immediately order the Qingcheng sect\u2019s Seven Swords and Law Enforcement disciples to attack Pyo-wol, he didn\u2019t. Because there was a high probability that he would lose the respect of the other warriors if he did.Both the cause and the initiative were completely lost to Pyo-wol.He even controlled and immobilized the warriors with fear. It was the first time in the history of Sichuan that such a man appeared. Even in the heyday of the Tang Family, they could not dominate the warriors with this level of fear.\u201cHu\u2026!\u201dMuhwajin let out a sigh.Just as Yong Seol-ran said, it was time for them to step back. He handed Mu Jeong-jin\u2019s body to Mu Young and approached Pyo-wol.\u201cWe would also like to retrieve the body of Mu Jeong-jin and leave. Will you allow us?\u201dEveryone\u2019s eyes were focused on Pyo-wol\u2019s face. The situation would depend on how he would respond. Pyo-wol looked at Muhwajin and Yong Seol-ran without saying a word.His expressionless eyes pierced their hearts like a dagger. It was not long after that Pyo-wol opened his mouth.\u201cIf I let you go, you\u2019ll dream of revenge. Just like I did\u2026\u201d\u201cI promise in my name. The Emei sect will never take revenge on Daehyup Pyo.\u201d\u201cHow can I believe that?\u201d\u201cYou have to believe it. I\u2019ll make it happen.\u201dYong Seol-ran\u2019s words contained a strange echo. Pyo-wol looked at Yong Seol-ran\u2019s face half-heartedly.Even when they met in the underground cave seven years ago, Yong Seol-ran was somehow different from the other Emei disciples. Even now, although she sounded polite, she did not show any humility.\u201cIf Daehyup Pyo does not accept my proposal, we have no choice but to prevent such a worst-case scenario.\u201d\u201cYou can leave.\u201dPyo-wol nodded his head.As long as the Guhwasata, the cause of all these incidents, was killed, he found no more reason to pay any more attention to the Emei sect.Yong Seol-ran bowed her head slightly towards Pyo-wol and stepped back.\u201cEveryone, stop crying. We are sinners who don\u2019t deserve to cry.\u201dShe urged the crying Emei disciples to retrieve the bodies of the dead. The warriors of Emei, who recovered the bodies of their colleagues including the Guhwasata, left the battlefield helplessly.In the meantimes, Muhwajin was troubled. With this incident, their sect had lost against a single person making their reputation fall to the ground. His heart was heavy as he seemed to see the bleak future of the Qingcheng sect.\u2018I should have stopped Senior Brother right away.\u2019No matter how much he regretted it now, it was of no use.\u00a0For now, it was important to retreat while preserving the power of the Qingcheng sect.\u00a0Muhwajin said,\u201cSince we both have our own faults, I won\u2019t ask you any more than this. With this, we will forget all resentment towards each other.\u201dThey were friendly enough to forget each other\u2019s grudges, and in fact, it was nothing more than a declaration of surrender by the Qingcheng sect.There was a humiliated expression on the faces of all the disciples of the Qingcheng sect, including Muhwajin. But no one dared to flinch. It is because they know that the momentum was on Pyo-wol\u2019s side.Pyo-wol nodded his head.Muhwajin took the signal of Pyo-wol and then left after collecting the dead bodies of the Qingcheng sect warriors.Now, only the Black Cloud Corps and the soldiers were left in the area.Jang Muryang made an absurd expression on his face.\u2018Is this how it ends? For one man\u2026\u2019All the work he had done in Sichuan was in vain. The Emei sect, who had been their strong backer, became a remnant and returned to Mount Emei, leaving them behind.The Black Cloud Corps also lost quite a bit of their troops to Pyo-wol. However, in the current atmosphere, their revenge could not be carried out.This is because Jang Muryang himself was seriously injured by Pyo-wol.If the dagger stuck in his right chest had been pushed an inch more to the side, he would have already stopped breathing. Just being alive right now was a miracle.\u2018To make all these boards by yourself and succeed. A true grim reaper has appeared in Jianghu.\u2019Jang Muryang bit his lip.Like the Emei and Qingcheng sect, Jang Muryang felt that they had lost. As long as the atmosphere and initiative were completely transferred to Pyo-wol, no matter how much he and the Black Cloud Corps struggled, they would only be humiliated.\u2018Shit! I will make sure you will pay for this.\u2019Jang Muryang turned back with an angry face. The Black Cloud Corps followed.When the Black Cloud Corps left the battlefield, there was nothing the other warriors could do. They looked at Pyo-wol with fearful eyes.Now they also realized that the leadership of Sichuan had passed on to Pyo-wol.To think a single assassin could produce such unbelievable results.Pyo-wol stepped forward.There were many warriors, but no one stopped Pyo-wol. Rather, they reluctantly stepped back and opened the way.Pyo-wol walked an open path made by the warriors. The warriors had an intuition that a new legend had been born in Sichuan Province.The legendary assassin\u2026The soldiers looked at him with awe-inspiring eyes. But not everyone was like that.On the contrary, there were men who burned with a sense of revenge.\u2018Pyo\u2026wol!\u2019Among the warriors, there was a middle-aged man staring at Pyo-wol.\u00a0It was Woo Jinpyeong.He was a man who lost his child, Woo Gunsang, to Pyo-wol and was the second-in-command of the Qingcheng sect.\u00a0He wanted the Qingcheng sect to take revenge, but the Qingcheng sect betrayed his expectations. Since the Qingcheng sect have already said that they will be retreating and forgoing their resentment, they cannot take his revenge on Pyo-wol.\u2018Good! I will take revenge for my child with my own strength.\u2019On that day, Woo Jinpyeong sold all his property and left Sichuan.* * *The power dynamics in Sichuan had a great change.The Emei and Qingcheng sect, who had been fighting for supremacy so far, stopped their activities almost at the same time, while the other sects locked their doors and focused on recovering the damage.Naturally, the Sichuan entered a period of stagnation.The warriors of Sichuan kept their mouths shut about that particular day\u2019s events as if they had made a promise.It was a day of filth that will never be erased for them.They did not have the courage to dare to bring back the shameful memories of being overwhelmed by a single assassin.Many people died, and many clans suffered great damage, but no one dared to dream of revenge against Pyo-wol.It was because of the fea that Pyo-wol might come silently for them if they closed their eyes at night.Time passed with the silence of the people.The streets of Chengdu, which had been destroyed by the clash of the martial artists, also found some stability, and people returned to their daily lives.Everyone went back to their respective places as if nothing had happened, but the memories of that day were deeply engraved in the people\u2019s minds. There was one kind of people who was not that much affected.It was the merchants. They regained their vitality the fastest.Merchants quickly rebuilt the destroyed stores and resumed business. As merchants began to bring in and sell goods from outside, people returned to Chengdu.In that way, Chengdu was revived, and people from outside Sichuan began to come again.The Cheonhak Sangdan was one of those who entered Chengdu.As soon as the Cheonhak Sangdan entered Chengdum, they loaded about 20 carts full of good quality silk and precious ornaments. The high-quality silk and splendid ornaments they brought were not easily available, so the merchants of Chengdu were in an uproar.For this single run, the Cheonhak Sangdan mobilized as many as a hundred people, including merchants, warrior escorts and laborers to do their chores.Cheonhak Sangdan borrowed the entire large guest house of Chengdu and stayed there.The head of the Cheonhak Sangdan, Geum Chusan, is a middle-aged man in his late forties. He had a majestic body and bulging eyes. He is tenacious and calculative as he tries to gain the maximum benefit from any run.Because of that, the Cheonhak Sangdan quickly became a top merchant group, and the people at the top admired Geum Chusan.At least among the members of Cheonhak Sangdan, Geum Chusan was like an absolute person.But that same Geum Chusan was kneeling at this very moment.It was such an unusual appearance that the people of Cheonhak Sangdan would never have believed it, not unless they witnessed this spectacle themselves.However, there was no light of humiliation on the face of Geum Chusan, who was kneeling. He was naturally bowing his head towards the young man sitting opposite of him.Unlike Geum Chusan, who wore colorful silk clothes, the young man\u2019s attire was very modest.His soft facial lines and curved eyes like half moons were impressive. His smile on his face made the people watching him feel pleasant.But Geum Chusan, who was kneeling in front of him, was very nervous. He was one of the few who knew that the man in front of him was different from what he looked like.He carefully reported to the young man.\u201cAll the profits from the trip were over 300 gold coins. I think I\u2019ll be able to get a little more profit if I go back to buying grain in Chengdu.\u201d\u201cAs expected of our captain. It\u2019s amazing that you can make a profit on any trip.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s too much, Lord Hong!\u201d\u201cPlease refrain from using that name. Just call me Young Master Hong here.\u201d\u201cYes, Young Master Hong!\u201d\u201cWhile I have come this far, I have been very indebted to the Lord Geum. I hope that you will return safely.\u201d\u201cWeren\u2019t we going back together?\u201dGeum Chusan looked at the young man in surprise.\u201cBranch manager Oh is dead.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cWhen I found out that the report was delayed, he was confirmed dead when a riot broke out in Chengdu.\u201d\u201cH, how?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what we must find out from now on.\u201dThe young man stretched out and said. Geum Chusan looked at him with fearful eyes. The young man\u2019s name was Hong Yushin.Hong Yushin was the head inspector of the Hao clan.It was his job to monitor the overall movements of the Hao clan, to make sure there are no abnormalities, and to solve any problems that arise.That\u2019s how powerful his authority was.The Cheonhak Sangdan was one of the camouflage units operated by the Hao clan. It was their job to collect the necessary information while traveling around the world under the pretext of being a merchant.Hong Yushin said,\u201cIf you stay here for a long time, people will become suspicious. Buy things in moderation and leave.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do that. But don\u2019t you need our help?\u201d\u201cBranch manager Oh is dead, but the branch itself is intact. We have to use them.\u201d\u201cOkay. Since I know that I will now take my leave.\u201dGeum Chusan bowed his head deeply.Hong Yushin smiled and got up from his seat.\u201cThen I\u2019ll go out too. I participated in the uprising as a jabbu, because people would think it strange if I was alone with Sang Sang-ju for too long.\u201d\u201cPlease take care of yourself. Young Master Hong!\u201d\u201cThank you. Then, I wish you the best of luck next time.\u201dHong Yushin went ahead of Geum Chusan and came out of the room. He walked through the streets of Chengdu without looking back.It was late at night, but there were still many people on the street.In the red light district, many lanterns were hung so the streets were brightly lit.\u201cThere, young man over there. Come in.\u201d\u201cHo Ho!\u201dCourtesans with their torsos protruding through the open windows seduced men walking down the street with their playful gestures and voices.The smell of the courtesans\u2019s stakes was carried by the wind and reached Hong Yushin\u2019s nose.\u201cGood, good.\u201dHong Yushin nodded his head with a satisfied smile.He was also a man.He was also a man of the age when he would be in full swing.The smell of the pretty courtesan\u2019s stake was enough to lift his mood. However, there was not a single flutter in his eyes as he looked at the prostitute.His face was obviously excited, but his eyes were as cold as ice. However, Hong Yushins\u2019s eyes were very small and curved in the shape of a half moon, so people could not see his pupils.Hong Yushin wandered around the red light district for a while, then entered the biggest brothel. The brothel named the Water Lily Pavilion,1\u00a0was famous for having the most prostitutes in Chengdu.For that reason, except for special occasions, it was always crowded with customers.He entered the Water Lily Pavilion, but no one paid attention to Hong Yushin. This is because the courtesans were greeting the other guests, and the workers were busy with their own work.Hong Yushin had a confident aura that made the others feel intimidated. So, he caught the attention of the general secretary.The general secretary approached Hong Yushin with hurried steps.\u201cWelcome, dear guest! Is there any courtesan\u00a0 you are looking for in particular?\u201d\u201cI want to meet the brothel keeper.\u201d\u201cIt would be difficult for you to meet brothel keeper if you have no prior appointment.\u201dAt that moment, Hong Yushin took out a small copper plate from his pocket and showed it to him. For a moment, the secretary\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cYour subordinate is seeing the head inspector.\u201d\u201cShh! Be quiet.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t make a fuss, and call for the brothel keeper. Bring also all the materials that recorded the recent events in Chengdu.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dA cold sweat ran down the back of the general secretary.\u00a0\u2018I can\u2019t believe the head inspector is coming from the main headquarters.\u2019The White Lily Pavilion was one of the brothels operated by the Hao clan. However, this was the first time the inspector had personally visited. So he couldn\u2019t help but be more nervous.\u2018What is going on in Chengdu?\u2019\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 88": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 88Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHong Yushin sat in the room given to him by the general secretary and read the report written by Bunta.In the meantime, the general secretary and the brothel keeper frequently went in and out of the room where Hong Yushin was.After reading all the books, Hong Yushin muttered.\u201cEverything else is here except for the Chengdu\u2019s Directory of Martial Artist which is missing.\u201dThe Chengdu\u2019s Directory of Martial Artist was a precious booklet containing the personalities and trends of the active warriors working in Chengdu and Sichuan.The Chengdu branch updated the booklet every ten days to include new information, and sent a copy to the main headquarters every two months.Through the information obtained, Haomun Headquarters was able to grasp the trends of Sichuan Province and Chengdu as if it were in the palm of their hand.However, for the past two months, no information from Sichuan has come to the headquarters.It was later found out that the branch manager, Oh Sang-kyung, who was supposed to report, had been killed.Oh Sang-kyung was the only link between the branch and the main headquarters.All information from the branch is transmitted to the headquarters through him. Since such an important person had died, it was only natural that information from Sichuan would not arrive to the main office.For that reason, for the past two months, they have not been able to get any information about what happened in both Sichuan and Chengdu.\u201cAnd this happened, right?\u201dHe looked at the booklet placed on top.The booklet described a series of recent events in Chengdu.\u201cA single assassin has devastated the entire Sichuan? Do you want me to believe this?\u201dThe booklet contained unbelievable content.It is said that the sect leader of the Emei faction, the loser of Sichuan, was killed, and Mu Jeong-jin, the strongest warrior of the Qingcheng sect was killed by one assassin, and many other sects suffered great damage.The reason why it is hard to believe what is written in the booklet is because the exact process was not described, and only the end results were written.If the branch manager, Oh Sang-kyung, was alive, he would have commanded his subordinates to systematically collect and organize the information. However, the core of the story was missing because there was no central person in charge and only what Haomun witnessed.Even the assassin\u2019s name and appearance were not properly recorded.If Oh San-kyung were still alive, he would probably have pursued the assassin to the end and uncovered everything.Name, age, place of birth, clan affiliation, and even the place of residence.However, after Oh San-kyung\u2019s death, the branch system was changed, so various types of information were mixed up.\u201cIn the end, I have to move.\u201dHong Yushin sighed.He immediately called the brothel keeper.The Water Lily Pavilion\u2019s brothel keeper was a beautiful woman in her mid-thirties.Wearing a splendid silk robe, she showed off her splendor with a lot of ornaments on her hair that was neatly turned up.\u201cDid you call for me?\u201d\u201cHow many Haomun people are there in Chengdu now?\u201d\u201cThere are two courtesans, about four hundred people who are engaged in errands and about one hundred people who have joined as workers of each clan.\u201d\u201cOkay! From now on, I\u2019m going to tell all the Haomun people to follow this assassin\u2019s whereabouts. Anything is fine. If it\u2019s related to him, ask them to collect even the smallest details.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d\u201cAnd bring me all the information.\u201dHong Yushin, who gave the order, got up from his seat.The brothel keeper looked at Hong Yushin in surprise.\u201cAre you going to move on your own? Let\u2019s get over your fatigue. I\u2019ve got the prettiest one on standby.\u201d\u201cIf the opponent really has this ability, the headquarters should manage the information directly.\u201d\u201cWell!\u201d\u201cSet aside all other information and prioritize collecting information about the assassin first. Please be careful not to miss even a single word from the guests, especially to high-class prostitutes. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cYes! I will.\u201dThe brothel keeper quickly lowered her head.Hong Yushin was the chief inspector from the main headquarters.She wanted to stay out of his sight and go back to receiving other guests.\u00a0Hong Yushin left the brothel keeper behind and left the Water Lily Pavilion. It had been a long time since he had personally moved and collected information.But he was confident.To become the head inspector of the Haomun, it is a must to have the ability to collect information. In fact, Hong Yushin showed outstanding ability on the front line.The first place he went to was Tangjiatuo.The report stated that a great fight had taken place in Tangjiatuo. So it got interesting.\u00a0Tangjiatuo was the home of the Tang Family. Although it is now extinct and only the ruins remain, the name alone has a special meaning.\u201cDid he lure and subdue the Qingcheng and the Emei faction to such a place?\u201dIt was not easy to believe. But it was written that way in the report, so he had to check it with his own eyes. In what way the assassin had overwhelmed many soldiers.A long time has passed and there were no traces of that time. Still, Hong Yushin persisted in searching for Tangjiatuo.As a result, it was possible to find the remains of various hidden weapons and machinery in Tangjiatuo.Hong Yushin looked at the fine silver needle in his hand. The silver needles are so thin that they cannot be distinguished with the naked eye.\u201cIs there a blacksmith with this level of metallurgy? With this level of metallurgy, you can only see it in the Tang Family in its heyday. Don\u2019t tell me the Tang Family has come back?\u201dHong Yushin\u2019s eyes narrowed.\u201cMaybe there are still some who have inherited the metallurgy of the Tang Family in their heyday. If that\u2019s the case, then that assassin might have asked the Tang Family\u2019s craftsmen for help.\u201dFortunately, the silver acupuncture was not poisoned. If there are any remaining successors to the Tang Family\u2019s dictatorship, the situation would become more serious.The dictatorship of the Tang Family was truly terrifying, and many warriors were still afraid of them. It was because of their dictatorship that many people were reluctant to mention their name even though it had been a long time since the Tang Family was wiped out.Hong Yushin got up.\u201cFirst, we need to find the craftsman who made this silver needle. He must know the whereabouts of the assassin.\u201dHong Yushin hastily returned to the Water Lily Pavilion.He thought it was an old artisan who made hidden weapons and machinery. It is because the skill of a craftsman increases as much as the years he had lived and as much as the time he had spent hammering an iron.Hong Yushin was confident that he would be able to find the old artisan in no time.* * *A few months ago, the bloodbath brought about many changes in Chengdu.One of them is that many houses and shops have changed owners. Some people had sold their houses because they could not handle the shock of turning into a mob and looting while the others left the city in despair over their collapsed businesses.in despair over the collapsed shops.Their reasons were diverse.As such, many stores have welcomed new owners. An example would be a store on the street south of Chengdu. To be precise, it was a workshop, not a store.The old craftsman, who was the original owner of the workshop, was so shocked by the bloodshed happening in front of his eyes that he ended up selling his workshop. He wanted to live in peace for the rest of his life.The new owner that took over his workshop was a young craftsman.\u00a0The young craftsman melted into the place where the old craftsman\u2019s hands had been stained. As if this place had belonged to him from the beginning.The young craftsman was immersed in his final work.Kangkang!The red-hot iron was changing shape every time he struck the hammer.The iron that has been beaten for a long time was then placed in water to cool it, then put it back in the brazier to heat it up, and then beat it again\u2026The young craftsman repeated such tedious work countless times.A small dagger was made that way.The young craftsman, who had been appreciating his work for a while, began to carefully sharpen his blade.Seukseuk!Each time the dagger passed over the whetstone, the blade was sharpened.The young craftsman put a lot of effort into setting up the blade of the sword.\u201cHu\u2026!\u201dAfter setting the blade until he was satisfied, the young craftsman got up. After squatting for a long time, his whole body was stiff and aching. Still, the young craftsman did show a tired or painful expression.It was his first time having a space of his own.No matter how hard the work was, it did not feel difficult at all here.The young craftsman placed the newly made dagger on the workbench. On the workbench were piled up daggers that had already been made.Including the new ones, there were ten in all.He put all the daggers in his leather pocket and left the workshop.He locked the door of the workshop and looked at the entrance for a long time.It had a shabby exterior without even a signboard, but to him, it looked more beautiful than any splendid engraving.The young craftsman checked the lock once more and moved on.He left Chengdu and walked for a long time.The place we arrived at was the Min River, the lifeline of Sichuan Province. The Min River was a huge river that passed through the basins of the fertile Sichuan province.The fertile land was maintained as sediment from the upstream was supplied to the basin along the Min River.Thanks to this, farmers always have a bountiful harvest, and the people of Sichuan were able to maintain a prosperous life.Dozens of ships floated leisurely on the vast Min River.They were all fishing boats.Fishermen were wrestling with nets on their large and small fishing boats.The young craftsman narrowed his eyes and looked at the ships. A smile appeared on the lips of the young craftsman who had been looking at the ships for a long time.A particularly small boat came into his sight.It was a small boat that could only fit one or two people. But there was no one on the boat.It was as if the boat was floating on its own.The young craftsman shouted at the ship.\u201cI\u2019m here!\u201dThe voice of the young craftsman was quickly buried because it was so far away and the sound of the river flowing overlapped.When the young artisan was about to shout once more, someone\u2019s upper body appeared on the ship. It looked like he was lying on his back and got up.He immediately began to row at the young craftsman.It took a long time for the boat to reach the water due to the long distance. Still, the young craftsman waited patiently without being annoyed.Thud!When the boat finally reached the shore and the man on board appeared, the young craftsman unwittingly began to swear.\u201cDamn!\u201dUnder the hot sun, a white glowing skin, a beautiful face that made it hard to distinguish whether they\u2019re a man or a woman, and a dark atmosphere.\u00a0The man had an appearance that was not of this world.He had seen this face a few times already, but he still has never gotten used to it. The man was Pyo-wol. And the young craftsman was Tang Sochu.When Tang Sochu was staring blankly at him, Pow-wol spoke first.\u201cWhy are you standing like that?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just jealous.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI wonder what it would be like to live with that face.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t come here to say something useless, did you?\u201d\u201cAh! It\u2019s finished\u2013\u201dHe handed the leather bag he was holding to Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol took out a dagger from the leather pocket and examined it. The blue-forged dagger was the ghost dagger.In the fight against the Guhwasata and Mu Jeong-jin, the ghost daggers were greatly damaged. Some were even broken beyond repair.For that reason, Pyo-wol asked Tang Sochu to fix the ghost daggers.Tang Sochu chose to build a new one rather than fix it. Because there was a limit to simply repairing it.In order to make it stronger, it was necessary to obtain high-quality iron. Because of that, it took a long time to make the ghost dagger again.The ghost monument was one of the reasons Pyo-wol stayed here.A small smile appeared on the corner of Pyo-wol\u2019s lips.Because he really liked the newly created ghost daggers.\u00a0The balance is more perfect than before, and the sharpness is doubled. The combination of the Soul-Reaping Thread and ghost dagger can increase the power of his assassination skills.Pyo-wol stored the ghost daggers on his leather belt.Tang Sochu asked Pyo-wol, who had a satisfied expression on his face.\u201cBut why do you float a boat when you\u2019re not going to catch any fish?\u201dThere were no nets or fishing rods in the boat Pyo-wol was on.Pyo-wol replied calmly.\u201cI wanted to do it.\u201d\u201cWhat did you want to do?\u201d\u201cLying on a boat doing nothing and looking at the sky.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201dAt Pyo-wol\u2019s calm reply, Tang Sochu was at a loss for words. He knew that Pyo-wol had lived without sunlight for fourteen years. He wondered if he would have been able to keep his sanity if he had been imprisoned for such a long time like Pyo-wol.The conclusion was that he was not sure.Although he prided himself on being quite tenacious, he couldn\u2019t dare compare himself to Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol, who endured all these years and eventually completed his revenge, was the kind that he dared not imitate.And the wish of such a strong man was to just do nothing and look at the sky.Somehow he could understand him, but it made him feel sad.Pyo-wol then said,\u201cEat before you go.\u201d\u201cNever mind. You can\u2019t catch a fish. What\u2013\u201d\u201cI can just grab one.\u201dIn response to the Tang Sochu\u2019s refusal, Pyo-wol reached out to the river.At Pyo-wol\u2019s reckless behavior, Tang Sochu looked at him, wondering what kind of goblin he was playing. Pyo-wol closed his eyes for a moment and concentrated.After a while, he opened his eyes and pretended to be pulling something. Then a large fish jumped out of the water as if caught on a fishing line.Pyo-wol was fishing with the Soul-Reaping Thread.Tang Sochu shook his head at the sight that was hard to believe even though he had seen it with his own eyes.\u201cCrazy!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 89": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 89Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayPyo-wol\u2019s residence was a small house on a hill near Min River.The house, which was previously owned by a fisherman\u2019s family, has been abandoned for a long time and its structure was barely maintained.Pyo-wol simply repaired the abandoned house and used it as a residence.After Tang Sochu returned, Pyo-wol lay on the floor alone and looked up at the night sky.It was the darkness he was tired of seeing even in the underground cave. But there was a difference.A sea of \u200b\u200bstars flowing through the night sky.It was the Milky Way.Pyo-wol stared blankly at the Milky Way without doing anything else.He thought all my emotions were worn out, but when he saw the sea of \u200b\u200bbrilliantly shining stars, he felt something strange.That was then.Crash!He could hear the rustling and breaking of leaves.Pyo-wol raised his upper body and looked in the direction where the sound came from.It was not the sound of an animal moving. Pyo-wol senses become particularly sensitive in the dark. He immediately recognized that the owner of the footsteps was a master of martial arts.After waiting for a while, the owner of the footsteps appeared in the darkness.There was a gleam in Pyo-wol\u2019s eyes.Because he recognized the identity of the uninvited guest.\u2018Yong Seol-ran!\u2019Yong Seol-ran was the woman who exuded splendid beauty despite wearing modest and light clothing. She walked straight towards Pyo-wol.The appearance of Yong Seol-ran approaching with her eyes slightly lowered was like a picture in itself.Sarak! Sarak!Yong Seol-ran, who had passed through the grass, stopped in front of Pyo-wol.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cWhen you have a guest, don\u2019t you even tell them to sit down?\u201d\u201cSit yourself.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dYong Seol-ran smiled slightly and sat down in front of Pyo-wol. She looked around and said.\u201cYou\u2019re staying in a nice place. It took me a long time to find it. I thought you were out of Sichuan.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a place I want to stay for a long time.\u201d\u201cI agree. If I could, I would also want to live in a place like this. Having no worries or troubles\u2026\u201dThe darkness hid everything in the world, but with the level of Yong Seol-ran, she could still distinguish the scenery to some extent with her excellent eyesight.Behind the house, there is a small hill that blocks the wind. While in the front, the view is wide open so the huge Min River and the plain can be seen at a glance.Anyone who comes to a place like this will surely want to stay for a long time.Suddenly, Yong Seol-rans gaze turned to the sky.A sea of \u200b\u200bstars came into her eyes.Although it is a landscape that can be seen every day at Mt. Emei, it seemed even more splendid today.\u00a0The stars could be reflected on Yong Seol-ran\u2019s eyes.She stared at the sky for so long.After some time had passed, Yong Seol-ran looked at Pyo-wol. Even then, Pyo-wol was looking at her without saying a word.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I came here all of a sudden, and you were paying attention to the wrong place. Actually, a lot of things happened today. So I was a little confused.\u201d\u201cI was excommunicated today. To be exact, I was the one who asked to be excommunicated, and my senior sister, Cheolsim, who became a new sect leader gave me permission.\u201dEven though Pyo-wol did not ask why, Yong Seol-ran continued to speak.\u201cI am now a person who has nothing to do with the Emei sect. Aren\u2019t you curious why I made this choice?\u201d\u201cNot really.\u201d\u201cI thought so. Please listen anyway. Because it\u2019s related to you. Now, our sect, no, the Emei sect, can\u2019t hold their heads up high in Jianghu anymore. The cowardice that the master had done was revealed, and her face and reputation fell to the floor. Now, even affiliated sects have turned their backs on us. Regardless of public sentiment, no one believes in the Emei sect anymore. I know, this is all self-inflicted. All of the Emei school disciples know that fact. But the human heart is not always rational. \u201c\u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cThe Emei sect wants to get revenge on you. Even though it\u2019s their fault, they still want to save their face at the least. But they can\u2019t do that because I was there looking out for them. Also, I know that if they get beaten by you again the next time, they\u2019ll never be able to recover.\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s why you set yourself up for excommunication.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019re sharp as expected.\u201dYong Seol-ran shook her head.She looked at Pyo-Wol with an expression of genuine admiration. Pyo-wol accurately and quickly grasped the core of the words she was talking about.Yong Seol-ran was raised by Guhwasata.Guhwasata, who recognized her qualities, raised her with great sincerity. She generously passed on the vision of the Emei sect and gave her various elixirs.As a result, Yong Seol-ran was able to become one of the leading disciples in the Emei sect.If it were just that, Yong Seol-ran would have been loyal to the Emei sect.However, Guhwasata hoped to get results beyond what she had invested in, and she saw Yong Seol-ran as a tool to maximize her profits.She ignored all of Yong Seol-ran\u2019s will and pushed for an arranged marriage with Woo Gunsang. There were many other instances where Guhwasata arbitrarily pushed and forced her to do other things.And each time, Yong Seol-ran was left disappointed. So inn the end, she started to hate Guhwasata.Even her senior sisters, who were supposed to support Yong Seol-ran, were jealous of her and often ignored her.Because of that, Yong-Seolran wandered alone.Although she belonged to the Emei faction, she was completely pushed out of the center of power and human relations. She was alienated. Still, Yong Seol-ran did not leave the Emei sect.No, she couldn\u2019t leave.\u00a0She thought\u00a0 she had to at least repay the kindness she had received from her master. It\u2019s been like that for over a decade. And not so long ago, that happened.Guhwasata died and the Emei sect collapsed.The Emei sect mused over their grudge against Pyo-wol. All the incidents might have happened because of them, but they still blamed it all on Pyo-wol.However, they couldn\u2019t move recklessly.If they fail again the next time, they could be really incapable of recovering.\u201cSo I asked for an excommunication. To fight you regardless of the Emei sect.\u201dHer reason was for her master\u2019s revenge. Even if she lost, it could be dismissed as an individual challenge that had nothing to do with the Emei faction.There was nothing to lose for the Emei sect.As an added bonus, they had the advantage of being able to kick out Yong Seol-ran out of the Emei sect, who was like a thorn in their eye.There was no reason not to accept Yong Seol-ran\u2019s request for excommunication as Cheolsim had to consolidate her power as she became the new sect leader.Pyo-wol asked,\u201cWhat do you gain by doing that?\u201d\u201cFreedom!\u201dYong Seol-ran replied with that single word. And her answer pierced Pyo-wol\u2019s heart.If she had come to him for a non-sincere reason, he wouldn\u2019t have dealt with her, but if it was a fight for freedom, he had to accept it.It is because he himself has been fighting for freedom.Pyo-wol got up from his seat.\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to waste more time.\u201d\u201cThank you for accepting my rude request.\u201dYong Seol-ran also got up. All of a sudden, a force like frost was radiating from her whole body.Yong Seol-ran released everything she had held back tightly. A storm-like energy swirled around her in a radius of about ten meters.Pyo-wol felt that the momentum of Yong Seol-ran was as good as the Guhwasata. On the contrary, she seemed to outperform the Guhwasata in the quantity of her internal force.Yong Seol-ran had been hiding her strength until now. Just like Pyo-wol did.Pyo-wol quietly raised his inner strength.Ciiit!It was Yong Seol-ran who moved first.Her sword split the darkness.For a moment, Pyo-wol saw the illusion of lotus petals flying in front of him. Whenever Yong Seol-ran wields her sword, a lotus-shaped energy rises and attacks.Supreme Lotus Sword.1It was a long lost technique of the Emei sect.It was difficult to learn, and it took a long time to master it, so it became a dead martial art. Yong Seol-ran accidentally stumbled upon it.\u00a0She couldn\u2019t ask anyone for help because it wasn\u2019t something formally taught. So she had to endure and learn by herself.With her hard work, she learned more than seven strokes of the Supreme Lotus Sword.Its power was beyond imagination.She had mastered only up to the seventh stroke, but it has the power that easily surpasses the other signature techniques of the Emei sect.The Supreme Lotus Sword went well with the Extreme Yin2\u00a0of Yong Seol-ran. In addition to that, the Nine Shadow Steps3\u00a0was added.Sarak! Sarak!The figure of Yong Seol-ran has been split into nine. This was brought about by the effect of the Nine Shadow Steps.Yong Seol-ran did everything in her power to release everything she had learned. All of her abilities and skills which were kept secret even in front of her master and the senior sisters, were now laid bare.Her sword was wrought with thread.Yong Seol-ran was like a priestess.Each of her movements was graceful and beautiful. But the result was not pretty.Purberberbuck!There was a hole in everything that her sword hit directly. Numerous holes were made in both the beautiful tree and the large rock.Pyo-wol moved sharply away from her sword. However, it was not easy to shake off Yong Seol-ran.Yong Seol-ran\u2019s Nine Shadow Steps contained the essence of the Emeis ect\u2019s martial arts. It made Pyo-wol curious why Guhwasata didn\u2019t learn that kind of footwork.In order to carry out the Nine Shadow Steps, a natural talent and excellent sense were required. Yong Seol-ran was the only one who met all of those conditions.Against Yong Seol-ran , Pyo-wol took out his ghost daggers.Ciiiit!A terrifying pounding sound echoed through the night sky.Two ghost daggers ripped the darkness to shreds, aiming for Yong Seol-ran\u2019s breath.Kkagagaggang!The sword of Yong Seol-ran and the ghost dagger of Pyo-wol collided dozens of times.Fireworks bloomed and fell, and the torn blades of grass flew in the air like rain. Yong Seol-ran generously released everything it had.Her internal energy was about to deplete, and her muscles complained of pain. Still, she never stopped attacking.Her motivation was revenge on behalf of her Master and Emei, but at this moment, there was no such trivial reason in her mind.There was an absolutely strong warrior in front of her.Only the thought of defeating him filled her mind.Phat!In an instant, Pyo-wol\u2019s figure disappeared from view.He unfolded the Black Lightning.As it was in the state of moving at lightning speed, the movements of Pyo-wol became several times faster.Everything around him slowed down.It was as if he had entered another world by himself.Of course, the pressure and burden on his body increased several times. However, Pyo-wol\u2019s body, which had been trained to the limit, endured such pain as if it\u2019s nothing and appeared in front of Yong Seol-ran.Yong Seol-ran tried to defend by spreading the Supreme Lotus Sword. But Pyo-wol\u2019s movements were more pronounced than hers.Bang!Yong Seol-ran flew backwards with an explosion.The pagoda has burst.Yong Seol-ran could not even scream at the intense pain that seemed to dismantle her whole body and fell to the floor.She tried to grab the sword even when her whole body was wrecked.At that moment, Pyo-wol gently stepped on her sword.Yong Seol-ran gave it her all, but the sword did not move as if caught in a huge rock.Kkuuc!Yong Seol-ran grabbed Pyo-wol\u2019s trousers and forced herself to stand up.\u201cHuff\u2026huff!\u201dBreathing heavily, she hit Pyo-wol with her fist.Puck! Puck!Her internal energy was exhausted, and her fists had no strength at all. Rather, every time she she punched, she felt a pain as if her muscles were being cut. Still, Yong Seol-ran did not stop punching Pyo-wol.Kwac!At one point, Pyo-wol grabbed her wrist.Yong Seol-ran struggled to fight, but she couldn\u2019t shake Pyo-wol\u2019s hand.Pyo-wol looked at Yong Seol-ran\u00a0 while suppressing both of her hands.\u201cHuff\u2026 Huff\u2026!\u201dYong Seol-ran forced herself to breathe and looked at Pyo-wol.Their eyes met in the air.At that moment, there was an exchange of intense emotions between the two of them.Pyo-wol released Yong Seol-ran\u2019s arm and pulled her. One of his arms went around her thin waist.\u00a0Yong Seol-ran wrapped both of her arms around Pyo-wol\u2019s neck.\u00a0He hit his mouth against her.Their lips met, and their tongue intertwined.They covetted each other\u2019s lips violently, as if they were sucking each other\u2019s souls.They couldn\u2019t think of anything.They only longed for each other.The two of them fell to the floor, without saying anything.\u00a0Clothes were torn off one by one, and their white naked bodies shone under the stars.They desired each other without shyness.They made love by pushing their bodies against each other while breathing roughly on the nape of each other\u2019s neck.Yong Seol-ran wrapped around Pyo-wol\u2019s body like a snake, and Pyo-wol pushed himself inside Yong Seol-ran as if he\u2019s going to destroy her.Until the sea of \u200b\u200bstars that covered the sky disappeared, they did not stop longing for each other.* * *When Pyo-wol opened his eyes, Yong Seol-ran was nowhere to be seen.She disappeared without leaving a note or saying goodbye.Not me being sad because they didn\u2019t end up together T-T she didn\u2019t even say goodbye\u2026 F </3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Because he was wasting time needlessly. However, Pyo-wol, the party involved, did not think so.He was having the most fulfilling time of his life.He was satisfied enough just to lie down on the boat and watch the clouds drift by.But every beginning had an end.One day, Pyo-wol suddenly thought that he had to leave this place.There was no reason to hesitate, no reason to stay.Pyo-wol left Min River as soon as he made up his mind.He was empty-handed when he came and he was empty-handed when he left.Pyo-wol left the Min River and returned to Chengdu.He did not return to Chengdu for any special purpose. He just moved as quickly as he could, so he naturally entered Chengdu.Pyo-wol found a guest house.Just a few months ago, a major incident that shook Chengdu and Sichuan took place, but it seemed that people had already forgotten the incident.In a peaceful atmosphere, people were hanging out and sharing drinks.Pyo-wol also took a seat and sat down.\u201cHck!\u201dIn an instant, the complexion of some people changed completely. They recognized Pyo-wol.They were all warriors who were Pyo-wol\u2019s enemies in Chengdu.To others it may be nothing but memories of days gone by, but to those who saw Pyo-wol in person, fear was stamped into their minds.For those who experienced the brutality and formidable mind hidden behind that inhuman appearance, Pyo-wol was truly a being of fear.They slowly got up from their seats, went outside, while looking at Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol knew that too. But he didn\u2019t really care about them.Pyo-wol looked out the window after ordering food from the waiter.The street, which was destroyed a few months ago, is now fully restored. It was impossible to tell that such a thing had happened just by looking at the appearance.The events of that day caused a great change in the power dynamics of Chengdu.An example was the collapse of the Golden Gate and White Flower Room, which actively cooperated with the Qingcheng sect and the Emei sect.They suffered a major blow from Pyo-wol\u2019s inescapable net, and most of all, they lost the strong background of the Qingcheng and Emei sect. As a result, their position was noticeably reduced.The Fire Dragon Room, which represented the interests of artisans, suffered great damage and completely stopped their external activities.People were talking about a period of recession and stagnation in Sichuan. This was inevitable because all the clan representatives of Sichuan Province suffered great damage and refrained from doing outside activities.\u00a0However, most people were living peaceful lives regardless of the situation in Jianghu.Such conflicting atmospheres coexisted in Chengdu.It was the same with the atmosphere inside the guest house.All the martial artists belonging to the military went out, but most of the guests were laughing and chatting without knowing the identity of Pyo-wol.After a while, a waiter served the food.It was the best food Pyo-wol had in a long time. He chewed tightly and savored the food. It took him a long time to eat because he ate so slowly.It was when Pyo-wol had almost finished eating.\u201cYoung Master Pyo-wol! Is that right?\u201dSomeone approached the table where Pyo-wol was sitting.He was an impressive man with soft eyes that curved like a half moon. He was Hong Yushin, the chief inspector of the Hao clan.Pyo-wol raised his head and looked up at Hong Yushin.\u201cWho is it?\u201d\u201cI think I asked first.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s even worse to see it in real life. What\u2019s with your face\u2014\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re here to talk about such useless things.\u201d\u201cAh! I\u2019m sorry. I spent so much energy and time trying to find Young Master Pyo-wol that I forgot to say hello. My name is Hong Yushin.\u201d\u201cHong Yushin?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the first time you will hear of it, because it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve revealed my real name to someone who is not a member of the Hao clan.\u201dHong Yushin grinned. His already half-moon eyes even drew a sharper curve.Pyo-wol asked,\u201cHow is the Hao clan\u2019s business anything to do with me?\u201d\u201cAre you really asking because you don\u2019t know?\u201dHong Yushin asked as if he was stunned.For the past ten days, he has had to struggle to find Pyo-wol.At first, he already wasted his time looking for the old artisan. When he obtained more information, he came to the conclusion the one he was looking for was most likely a young craftsman.Among the young craftsmen, he found a craftsman with excellent skills, and as a result, he was able to find a craftsman named Tang Sochu.Finding Tang Sochu did not solve the problem. He was very reticent, and had no intention of selling Pyo-wol\u2019s information to Hao clan.There was a way to force him to open his mouth, but that was not Hong Yushin\u2019s method.On that day, Hong Yushin searched for small and medium-sized warriors who were trapped in the inescapable net of that day, and found out the existence of Pyo-wol through their mouths.He found out Pyo-wol\u2019s name and appearance, but locating him was another matter.He mobilized all the Hao clan members to search around Chengdu, but no traces of Pyo-wol were found anywhere.As he was about to give up and leave Chengdu, information came that Pyo-wol had appeared in Chengdu again. Hong Yushin rushed to check Pyo-wol himself.\u201cIt\u2019s amazing.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t change the subject and tell me if you have any business with me.\u201d\u201cYou really don\u2019t know how scary the world is. If you think that everyone is afraid of you just because you gained a reputation in Sichuan, you are mistaken.\u201d\u201cYour tongue is long.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t say much then. Oh San-kyung. Did you kill him?\u201d\u201cOh San-kyung?\u201d\u201cThe manager of the Hao clan\u2019s Chengdu branch.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou bastard!\u201dHong Yushin jumped up. It was because he didn\u2019t expect that Pyo-wol would admit it so easily. He glared at him with terrifying eyes. But he couldn\u2019t shake Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol looked at Hong Yushin without changing his expression.The smile on Hong Yushin\u2019s face disappeared. The eyes hidden in the half-moon-shaped eyes shone sharply.\u201cDid you really killed him?\u201d\u201cYes. I killed him.\u201d\u201cWhy did you kill him?\u201d\u201cBecause he collected and sold my information.\u201d\u201cOnly for that reason\u2013 Don\u2019t you know that it is the Hao clan\u2019s job is to collect information?\u201d\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cAre you saying I have to stand by even if my information is collected and sold just because it\u2019s your main business?\u201dPyo-wol\u2019s voice became faint.For a moment, Hong Yushin felt goosebumps all over his body. But he tried to stay calm.\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to know how vast the Hao clan is. Do you think you can live comfortably outside the Hao clan\u2019s eyes?\u201d\u201cI never thought about it.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI never thought about living comfortably.\u201d\u201cHuh! You\u2019re a crazy person without a doubt. I told you you don\u2019t know how scary the world is. As long as I give an order, all the members of Hao clan in Chengdu will attack you. Are you okay with that?\u201d\u201cBefore that, your neck will fall. Then it\u2019s will be their turn.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t think that\u2019s really possible, do you?\u201d\u201cIt is possible.\u201dPyo-wol said without blinking an eye.For a moment, Hong Yushin felt a chill in his spine.It was because he instinctively knew that Pyo-wol\u2019s words were sincere.\u2018This punk!\u2019Before coming here, he researched Pyo-wol\u2019s whereabouts. And he found out how big of an event he caused.Because of this person, the Qingcheng and Emei sect lost an elder and sect leader, respectively. They also went into isolation after countless people were killed or injured.The spirit of the Sichuan Murim was greatly reduced.It was unbelievable what a single person had done.He couldn\u2019t even imagine how strong his martial arts were and how deep his mind had to be for this to happen. So Hong Yushin was still in a state of disbelief.Hong Yushin\u2019s threats did not work for Pyo-wol.He had no clue how much damage it would take to kill Pyo-wol. If he attacked Pyo-wol and missed it, the repercussions would be endless.\u2018The problem is that he\u2019s an assassin.\u2019According to what he has learned so far, Pyo-wol did not hesitate to escape even though he possessed a powerful martial art. If he felt he was at a disadvantage, he fled and hid for a chance.Pyo-wol had a completely different thinking system from the other warriors who reigned at the top of the Jianghu. In the climate of the current Jianghu who shames cowardice and worships face-to-face confrontation, Pyo-wol was clearly a foreign entity.So it felt more awkward.This is because the traditional response method does not work.\u2018It might be better to get rid of him now.\u2019It was when Hong Yushin was about to decide what he\u2019s going to do.Pipipit!Something white came out of Pyo-wol\u2019s waist.It was a ghost dagger.\u201cKeuk!\u201d\u201cGeugh!\u201dScreams were heard from outside.The ghost dagger pierced through the ceiling of the guest house, and the Hao clan\u2019s warriors who were hiding on the roof were devastated.Kukukung!Like hail, the warriors of the Hao clan fell to the floor where Pyo-wol and Hong Yushin were sitting.\u201cBastard!\u201dHong Yushin was surprised and tried to attack Pyo-wol.Suddenly, Hong Yushin\u2019s neck was tightened.Bang!Hong Yushin couldn\u2019t even scream and his face was thrown against the table.\u201cKekkuek!\u201dHong Yushin\u2019s face turned red.Something invisible squeezed his neck so he couldn\u2019t breathe. Hong Yushin pulled up the inner qi and tried to cut off the object that tightened around his neck. But the object squeezing his neck did not move.It was the thread of death, the Soul-Reaping Thread.Pyo-wol opened his mouth by squeezing Hong Yushin\u2019s neck.\u201cIt\u2019s better not to be seen living in front of me. I\u2019m a little sensitive.\u201d\u201cShut up! Oh, yes\u2013\u201dFor a moment, the Soul-Reaping Thread that had been squeezing his neck loosened a little. Hong Yushin was able to breathe freely. However, Pyo-wol did not completely release the Soul-Reaping Thread.Pyo-wol continued to speak while maintaining his Soul-Reaping Thread.\u201cIt\u2019s none of my business how the Hao clan is maintained or how it survives. I don\u2019t care, I really don\u2019t. But if you keep circling around and bothering me like this, I swear I\u2019ll cut off your sect leader\u2019s head. Do you think you can stop me? Even if you hire hundreds and thousands of escorts, it\u2019s no use. I\u2019ll hide for a year or a decade, waiting for the right opportunity. And when everyone\u2019s off guard, I\u2019ll slit your throat. If you don\u2019t believe what I\u2019m saying, you can try it.\u201dA cold sweat ran down Hong Yushin\u2019s cheek, who was still lying on the table. Instinctively, he knew that Pyo-wol\u2019s words were true.All of the people he hid on the roof of the guest house were experts from the inspection team. Each one of them was a master that could not be ignored. Such people did not react very much and were groaning because of his dagger.An unbelievable thing happened.It was then that Hong Yushin realized that Pyo-wol was much stronger and more radical than he had thought. He didn\u2019t realize that the information which he initially thought as unreliable turned out to be real.\u2018He ended up like this just because of his desire to live.\u2019Hong Yushin will not even realize how he will die.What kind of environment did Pyo-wol survive in? For him to be particularly sensitive.\u00a0Hong Yushin\u2019s eyes trembled. His face was still lying on the table.It was a humiliating position. But he couldn\u2019t even feel the humiliation. Because he was busy doing intense calculations in his head.It\u2019s up to him to come up with a way so that the Hao clan won\u2019t be harmed and get out of their situation safely.\u2018It\u2019s better for us to step back.\u2019The opponent\u2019s momentum is too fierce. It was like seeing an untamed wild wolf, or a ferocious bear.\u201cKeuk!\u201dAt that moment, the Soul-Reaping Thread clenched around his neck once more.\u201cYou\u2019re thinking of something else.\u201d\u201cUgh! That, that\u2019s not it!\u201d\u201cThen answer me right away.\u201d\u201cAh, yes. Well, I will.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t pay me any attention no matter what I do or how I\u2019m doing. If I caught you gathering my information again, then it won\u2019t end with just this.\u201dSreuk!Pyo-wol took the Soul-Reaping Thread.It was only then that Hong Yushin was able to get out of his humiliating posture. His face was red and hot, and there was a clear line around his neck.\u00a0Hong Yushin stroked the line left on his neck with his hand.Had it dug a little deeper, his head would have been separated from the body. Still, the chill in the back did not subside easily.Hong Yushin looked at Pyo-wol with red bloodshot eyes.His handsome face now looked like a demon.Hong Yushin has never seen anyone more radical and cruel than Pyo-wol. Hong Yushin clenched his fists in humiliation.That day, Hong Yushin sent a letter to the main headquarters.[ Target: Pyo-wol.Martial arts: Top quality.Risk: Unpredictable.Disposition: Excessive tendencies, CruelComprehensive Judgment: Requires distant monitoring of his daily life rather than close monitoring.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 91": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 91Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Western Highlands of Sichuan Province was like a giant folding screen, blocking the Central Plains1\u00a0and Saibei.2It was almost impossible for an ordinary person to cross the Western Highlands and go out. Of course, it is possible for those with exceptional courage or superior physical strength, but they also had to risk their lives to cross the highlands.Of course, there were roads leading to Saibei, but the borders were so tight that anyone without permission could not pass.When you pass through the gate of Saibei, the area facing Sichuan is called Xizang.The hidden area of \u200b\u200bthe west, hence the name Xizang.3Xizang has been an object of respect for people since ancient times.Occasionally, the masters of Xizang moved to Jianghu and caused great incidents, but all of them were in vain and instilled great fear in the people. So people thought that there were a lot of scary masters in Xizang.What people think is half right and half wrong.Not all of the martial artists in Xizang were that strong and fearful. However, some sects had a potential that was no less than that of Jianghu\u2019s Daemun faction.4One of them was Xiaoleiyin Temple.5After entering Xizang and walking west for a month, an area called Namling Forest was found. As the name suggests, it is a place with a huge forest, and people are reluctant to approach it even in broad daylight.There was an old temple in Namling Forest,6\u00a0which was Xiaoleiyin.Xiaoleiyin Temple did not allow the public to enter. In addition, there was a thick cloud cover all year round. So ordinary people could not even get close, let alone get in.It was this morning that the peace of Xiaoleiyin Temple, which had only been quiet, was broken. Suddenly a visitor came.They crossed Xizang with two coffins on their backs and arrived at the Xiaoleiyin Temple. At their visit, the thick cloud that surrounded Xiaoleiyin Temple disappeared and the road was opened.The visitors climbed the stairs one by one with their coffins on their backs and finally arrived at the Xiaoleiyin Temple.They lowered the coffin they were carrying, then clapped their necks and shouted.\u201cHyeolbul7, the lawful servant who is in charge of life and death in the world. Your disciples suffered tragic events due to our lack of power. Please relieve us of this injustice.\u201dThey repeated the same words over and over in unison. Tears were flowing from their eyes as they bowed their heads.After a while, someone appeared with a knock on the wooden table.They were monks who wore clothes red as blood.At the center of the monks who radiated extraordinary energy, there was an old monk with a particularly majestic aura.An ominous red atmosphere was flowing around the old monk. With a rosary the size of a walnut in his hand, the old monk bowed his head.He looked at the visitors.\u201cAren\u2019t you the disciples who were sent out to Sichuan?\u201d\u201cYes. We are the disciples who went out to the fortress under the command of the dignified former Beopjong.8\u201c\u201cThen, did you guys come back to being fishermen? I\u2019m sure that the former Beopjong must have ordered you to establish a base in Sichuan.\u201d\u201cKill me, my disciples have lost our sect leader and young master and we were chased out like a dog. Please release this injustice. Huhuhu!\u201dThe visitors sobbed and wept.They were the survivors of the Thunder Gates.After losing Mu Jeong-jin, the Qingcheng sect released the disciples of the Thunder Gates. However, the disciples who lost both their sect leader and young master had no place to relieve their injustice.\u00a0So, while carrying the coffins with the bodies of the two men on their backs, they walked a long way to find Xiaoleiyin Temple, which can be said to be their origin.\u201cWhat happened? I\u2019ve heard that you have successfully settled down in Sichuan.\u201d\u201cHuhu! That\u2019s\u2014\u201dThe disciples of Thunder Gates began to recount what had happened in Chengdu at length.The young master, Nam Ho-san, was killed by an assassin ordered by the Qingcheng sect, and Tae Yeon-ho, who went to hold the Qingcheng sect accountable, was killed by Mu Jeong-jin.\u201cHmm!\u201dHearing all the stories of the mourning Thunder Gates disciples, an intense gaze was emitted from the eyes of Hyeolbul.It was his master, Jeondae Beopchong, who took advantage of the seclusion period between the Qingcheng and Emei sect and sent some of his disciples back to infiltrate Sichuan.After establishing a bridgehead, his plan was to see an opportunity in the future and enter Sichuan.With the support of the Xiaoleiyin Temple and the plan of Jeondae Beopjong, the Thunder gates has steadily built its foundation.Although the plan to enter Chengdu was delayed because of the Qingcheng and Emei sect, Hyul Bul was satisfied by the fact that they had laid a solid foundation.If they continue to wait, there will definitely be a gap someday, and then entering the midfield was not a dream.Only if the Thunder Gates is alive and well.But both the sect leader and the young master of the Thunder Gates, who had been raised so painstakingly, were killed. Their foundation in Sichuan has been completely blown away.The monks who were escorting Hyeolbul asked themselves.\u201cHow dare the Qingcheng sect destroy one of our bases. This cannot be overlooked. What do you guys think?\u201d\u201cIt must not be overlooked. The Qingcheng sect must have known that the Thunder gates is a school related to the Xiaoleiyin Temple. Still, killing the head master and young master of the Thunder Gates is clearly an act of contempt for the Xiaoleiyin Temple. If we leave them as it is, many will ridicule our main sect.\u201d\u201cYes. If we ignore it, it is clear that many people will look down on Xiaoleiyin Temple in the future.\u201dThe monks who stood guard for Hyeolbul were the top monks of the Xiaoleiyin Temple. They all insisted on taking revenge on behalf of the Thunder Gates.Hyeolbul was having similar thoughts. Whatever the reason, they cannot condone this incident.\u201cSend Heukam9\u00a0to take care of this.\u201d\u201cWe take your orders.\u201dHeukam bowed deeply with his hands joined together.\u00a0No one raised any objection.The existence of the Heukam was special in the Xiaoleiyin Temple.Hyeolbul murmured.\u201cI\u2019ll make you regret touching the Xiaoleiyin Temple.\u201d* * *Pyo-wol left the guest house.After the meeting that day, Hong Yushin did not appear again. But Pyo-wol knew.The fact that Hong Yushin has not yet left Chengdu. Still, it didn\u2019t bother him too much because he didn\u2019t appear in front of him.The destination of Pyo-wol was the workshop of Tang Sochu.As soon as he arrived at the workshop, a powerful hammer sound was heard. It was the sound of Tang Sochu working.Pyo-wol opened the door of the workshop and went inside.The scorching heat in the workshop made it difficult to breathe. Tang Sochu was working in a harsh environment that an ordinary person would not be able to endure for even a moment.Tang Sochu had his shirt off as he was hammering. Countless beads of sweat were forming on his body.Tang Sochu did not even realize that Pyo-wol had arrived, as he concentrated on his work. Pyo-wol watched him work without disturbing him.It was almost an hour or so after his work was finished.\u201cWhoo!\u201dTang Sochu sighed and looked at the result in his hand.It was a single sword that he labored for a day or so. There were no sword energy, it was only a sword, but there was an unusual sense of anticipation.A satisfied smile appeared on the corner of his lips.The result was satisfactory for the amount of time he put in. Now, if the sword has a scabbard, it will be as good as any other famous sword.After appreciating the sword for a long time, only then Tang Sochu realized later that there was someone else in the workshop.\u201cUh?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s some cool stuff.\u201dPyo-wol got up from his seat.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you had arrived?\u201d\u201cYou were completely immersed in your work that I didn\u2019t dare interrupt.\u201d\u201cThank you! Thanks to you, I was able to complete this guy without interruption.\u201d\u201cIt looks like you got an order.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! There\u2019s been a rumor in Chengdu lately that my skills are good. So orders have increased a lot.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a relief.\u201d\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for you, brother, this wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201dAs he called Pyo-wol his older brother, Tang Sochu had an embarrassed expression. Because the title was still awkward.It was thanks to Pyo-wol\u2019s support that he was able to establish a workshop here. Most of the gold coins that Pyo-wol had were given to him. So he was able to take over the workshop and hold out until an order came in.For Tang Sochu, Pyo-wol was his real benefactor.He took revenge on the Qingcheng and Emei sect, and helped him lead a stable life by setting up a workshop. For Tang Sochu, it was a debt that he would not be able to repay even for the rest of his life.It was a Tang Sochu who was trampled on by many people just because he was using the surname of the Tang clan. Only one person did him a favor. So he felt even more grateful.\u201cBut what\u2019s going on? Has the ghost dagger been ruined again?\u201d\u201cNo. I have something I want to order separately.\u201d\u201cWhat do you want me to make?\u201d\u201cI need wrist armor.\u201d\u201cGauntlet?\u201dIn the fight against the Guhwasata and Mu Jeong-jin, Pyo-wol felt the need to protect his arms.As an assassin, Pyo-wol mainly engaged in close combat.He used the ghost dagger as his main weapon, but he had to be prepared for a close fight.It was a good idea to use a weapon other than the ghost dagger. So after much deliberation, Pyo-wol came to the conclusion that he should wear a gauntlet to protect his arms.If he can block the opponent\u2019s attack even just once using the armor, he will be able to create an opportunity for a counterattack.After hearing Pyo-wol\u2019s explanation, Tang Sochu nodded his head.\u201cThen I\u2019ll have to make it so that the fingers can move freely from the back of the hand to the forearm.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cIt would be better if the material is leather on top of the metal. That way it won\u2019t attract attention.\u201dIt seems that Tang Sochu has already figured out how to make the wrist armor.\u201cHow long will it take to complete?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 I think it\u2019ll take at least five days. I think I\u2019ll have to put several light iron plates on it, but I think it\u2019s going to take a lot of effort to secure the proper strength. Please hold out your arm for a while.\u201dWhen Pyo-wol reached out his arm, Tang Sochu carefully checked the arm\u2019s circumference, length, and shape.\u201cOkay now. Come back in five days. I\u2019ll make it by then.\u201d\u201cPlease do.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, and go ahead. I have to work now.\u201dTang Sochu left Pyo-wol behind and hurriedly started his work.Pyo-wol came out and walked towards the street where the stalls were crowded. Many people were coming and going on the street, and merchants were soliciting with their voices high.Pyo-wol walked down the street with his face half-covered with a scarf. Because too many people knew his face.Fortunately, most of the merchants and people looking to buy things were too busy bargaining, so they didn\u2019t pay attention to Pyo-wol.That was then.\u201cHow dare you try to sell me something like this!\u201dAlong with the roar, a crashing sound was heard.When Pyo-wol turned his head and looked up, he saw a person with a short stature and a curved back causing a disturbance.He was so angry that he overturned the stall as he looked at the owner. His eyes were so ferocious that the owner of the stall couldn\u2019t say anything and just trembled.\u201cHuh! I guess I looked funny because of my hunched back?\u201d\u201cOh, no\u2026!\u201d\u201cAnd you\u2019re asking for three pieces of coins for this sort of thing?\u201dThe hunchback shook the ornament in his hand.It was something the store owner brought to sell. It was inlaid with jade and pearls, giving it a sense of elegance.The owner said with a sad expression.\u201cThe cost was high, and the cost was calculated by adding up the craftsman\u2019s labor cost. Three silver pieces is already low\u201d\u201cQuiet. I want this for one silver.\u201d\u201cThen I am at a loss.\u201d\u201cSo you mean you can\u2019t give me a discount?\u201d\u201cPlease understand my situation.\u201dThe owner fell down and begged. But the hunchback\u2019s eyes who was looking at the owner were cold. A chain was hung from the hunchback\u2019s waist, and a large iron ball was attached to the end.If the owner was hit with a metal ball, the owner\u2019s head would explode like a rotten pumpkin at once.Knowing this, the owner fell to his knees and begged the hunchback for mercy. But the hunchback\u2019s eyes looking at the owner did not seem to know how to calm down.On the contrary, it felt like he was going to hit the owner with an iron ball at any moment.Then, loud laughter echoed through the street.\u201cHaha! How can the Iron Dwarf of Gongxian10\u00a0be so angry. The atmosphere is so gloomy, please stop tormenting the poor store owner. If you\u2019re short on money, I\u2019ll give it to you.\u201d\u201cWho are you?\u201dThe hunchback called Iron Dwarf quickly turned his head to the place where the sound was heard.Where his gaze was directed, there was a middle-aged man with a nice beard. He was smiling as he walked.Checking his face, the face of the Iron Dwarf was distorted.\u201cShadowless Monk Yu Shinfeng?11\u00a0Why are you here?\u201d\u201cHaha! I came all the way here because I was wandering with my niece.\u201dAs a middle-aged man called Yu Shinfeng took a step back, a mysterious woman standing behind appeared.She was a woman with a cute impression like a curious puppy.\u201cSo-ha! Say your greetings. That\u2019s the Iron Dwarf, Oh Kyung-wol Daehyeop of the Seven Stars, who has a great reputation in the southern part of Jianghu, including Hunan Province.\u201cThis girl Lee So-ha greets Oh Daehyeop.\u201dLee So-ha smiled and said hello to the Iron Dwarf.When it was revealed that he was a member of the Seven Stars, the Iron Dwarf could no longer act against the stall owner.Although the distance is too far and little is known about them in Sichuan, the Seven Stars was quite famous in the vicinity of Hunan.The Seven Stars was a sect founded by seven warriors who had sibling brothers.Although there are only seven members, each individual has a great skill and is united by a strong bond, so no one dared look down on them.Among them, the Iron Dwarf is famous for being dirty. Since he was born, he had a hunchback, so he was filled with a sense of inferiority. But even Iron Dwarf could not dare ignore the mature man in front of him.Shadowless Monk Yu Shinfeng.Although he did not belong to a particular clan, he was a man who was praised by many for his strong martial arts and great sense of chivalry.He maintained close acquaintances with many warriors who opposed his spirit.No matter how stubborn he was, he could not quarrel with such a man. It was clear that the repercussions would never end if they come up with a pretense.Yu Shinfeng said,\u201cHaha! If you really want that ornament, I\u2019ll buy it for you.\u201d\u201cNevermind! Who would want it?\u201dOh Kyung-wol, whose self-esteem was hurt, threw the jewelry he was holding at the stall owner. He looked at the people around him and said,\u201cWhat are you looking at, you bastards! Are you going to keep watching?\u201dThen he ran through the people and disappeared.Yu Shinfeng looked in the direction he disappeared and muttered,\u201cIf the Iron Dwarf came here, it\u2019s only a matter of time before the other soldiers from the Seven Stars arrive.\u201dIt was common in Jianghu that there was a storm wherever the Seven Stars was located.This took me forever to research because there\u2019s a lot of new characters and places. Ngl, I was staring at the whole map of China for so long, trying to make sense of the locations.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 92": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 92Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayYu Shinfeng\u2019s nickname was the Shadowless Monk.1Yesterday, he would appear in the east, and today he would be in the west, which is a thousand li away. He was given the nickname because it was so rare to see him appear.Yu Shinfeng wandered in Jianghu aimlessly and practiced medicine.He couldn\u2019t stand seeing injustice, so whenever he encountered such a situation, he would try to help the weak in any way. As a result, many people respected him and wanted to befriend him.Yu Shinfeng never rejected anyone who approached him.He had a good personality. Anyone he drank alcohol with even once considered him a true friend. Some people refer to Yu Shinfeng as the person who had the most friends in the world.Yu Shinfeng had one maternal niece, and she is currently traveling with him.Lee So-ha\u2019s nickname was Swallow Fairy.2\u00a0The fact that Lee So-ha, who was still young, was given a nickname meant that she boasts outstanding achievements.In fact, even at a young age, Lee So-ha was one of the most recognizable members of Jianghu.By belonging to the Golden Heavenly Hall3, a group with only a few members, it was clear how great she was.The Golden Heavenly Hall was a private group established a generation ago and was initially started for the exchange of some members. However, as time went on, it gradually expanded in size, and now all of the members of Jianghu\u2019s inner circle have grown to the point of wanting to be included in the Golden Heavenly Hall.Lee So-ha looked around the streets of Chengdu with curious eyes.She had traveled around Jianghu quite a bit since childhood, but this was the first time she had entered Sichuan Province. So everything felt unfamiliar to her.\u201cHey!\u201dYu Shinfeng looked at his niece and smiled.\u2018I get her reactions. Because Sichuan is a very closed and distant place, it is difficult to come here once in a lifetime.\u2019It had been a long time since he had come to Sichuan.There is no reason for him to come here unless there is something special. Even back then, when the Tang Family was still in existence, many people were reluctant to approach this area.Lee So-ha asked Yu Shinfeng,\u201cUncle! Where are you going? We\u2019re not going to stay in a guest house again, are we?\u201d\u201cHow could we? I have an acquaintance in Chengdu, so we can stay there.\u201d\u201cYou have an acquaintance in Chengdu, too?\u201dLee So-ha widened her eyes.Because the figure of Lee So-ha was so cute, Yu Shinfeng answered with a tearful voice,\u201cHaha! If we go straight to the end of this street, we will find Mister Gu Gayang5, who is the mayor of the city. He is close with this uncle. If he knows I\u2019m here, I\u2019m sure he won\u2019t kick us out.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201dLee So-ha took the lead as if she knew the place well. Yu Shinfeng looked at Lee So-ha\u2019s back with delight.\u2018I did a good job of bringing her back here.\u2019Yu Shinfeng, who usually chose to travel alone, had to bring Lee So-ha with him to give her the experience of being in Sichuan. Lee So-ha had already experienced many things while coming here, and those experiences will help her to develop in the future.\u201cHuh?\u201dA unique look appeared in Yu Shinfeng\u2019s eyes, who had been involuntarily looking around.It was because a man\u2019s face stood out among the multitude of people.Like a person who had never seen sunlight in his life, he was an impressive man with white skin and black eyes. Since the stranger had the lower half of his face covered with a scarf, Yu Shinfeng could not see his whole face, but by looking at the exposed part, he could guess that he was very handsome.What impressed him the most were his eyes.Even Yu Shinfeng, who had an easy time reading people\u2019s minds, was completely blocked from emotions to the point that he couldn\u2019t even see through him.As Yu Shinfeng frowned and tried to take a closer look again, the stranger\u2019s figure disappeared from the crowd.\u2018Who is that?\u2019At that time, Lee So-ha, who was ahead, grabbed his hand and pulled him away.\u201cUncle, what are you doing? As if you\u2019re soul had gone out\u2014\u201d\u201cHuh? Nothing. Let\u2019s go.\u201dHe shook his head and started walking again.It didn\u2019t take long for them to arrive at the old town hall.Yu Shinfeng, who was standing in front of the front door, frowned. For some reason, the atmosphere of the old town hall did not feel like what it used to be.\u2018What happened?\u2019Yu Shinfeng knocked on the front door of the old town hall. Then, after a while, someone came out. The man, who appeared to be in his mid-forties, carefully raised his head and looked at Yu Shinfeng and Lee So-ha.\u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cIs this the residence of the district\u2019s mayor?\u201d\u201cYes, so?\u201dThe face of the man who answered was full of vigilance. Thinking that something was strange, Yu Shinfeng asked again,\u201cI\u2019m Yu Shinfeng. I am a long time acquaintance of Mister Gayang. If he is inside, can you tell him that I\u2019m here?\u201d\u201cOkay. Please wait a moment.\u201dThud!The man closed the door and disappeared.Lee So-ha asked Yu Shinfeng.\u201cAre you really acquainted with Mister Gu? Why is their reaction so lukewarm?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure. It wasn\u2019t such a gloomy place before.\u201dYu Shinfeng scratched his head.The Gu Gayang he knew was a warm and affectionate person more than anyone else. Like Yu Shinfeng, he also likes to meet and befriend people, so Gu Gayang was always surrounded by a crowd.He could not have imagined that the atmosphere of the old town hall would be so dark.After a while, the door opened again and a skinny middle-aged man came out.Yu Shinfeng was surprised to see the middle-aged man.\u201cNo, Mister Gu! Is it really Mister Gu?\u201d\u201cWelcome. Sir Yushin! It seems like we haven\u2019t seen each other for nearly a decade!\u201d\u201cHow did this happen? How did you lose so much weight?\u201d\u201cA lot has happened in the past few months. Why don\u2019t we go inside?\u201d\u201cOkay let\u2019s do that. By the way, this is my niece Lee So-ha.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you, Young Miss.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you, Mister Gu! I\u2019ve heard a lot about you from Uncle.\u201dLee So-ha greeted him politely. Gu Gayang smiled contentedly at her.Gu Gayang lead the two of them into his house.The inside of the old manor, which was usually crowded with many people, was not just quiet, but it even looked rather bleak. There were traces of broken pieces all over the building.Yu Shinfeng couldn\u2019t stand his curiosity any longer and asked,\u201cWhat the hell happened here, Mister Gu!\u201d\u201cActually, a few months ago, Chengdu was turned upside down.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cA certain man turned the whole Chengdu upside down. Because of him, both the Emei and Qingcheng sects were severely damage. Many clan and military officers also went and closed their doors.\u201d\u201cSuch a thing happened?\u201d\u201cEveryone was quiet about it, so the story probably didn\u2019t spread outside of Sichuan. Even if someone knew, there would be very few.\u201d\u201cTell me more in detail. What happened.\u201d\u201cAt that time\u2026\u201d.Gu Gayang recalled what had happened that day.The day when the Qingcheng and Emei sects clashed because of one warrior, involving countless affiliated sects and sweeping the entire city into chaos.Even ordinary people were swept away by the madness. They became rioters and plundered.\u00a0The mayor also became a target for the mob. The mob destroyed the main gate of the old town hall and they looted anything they could find. Among the mobs, there were many people who had been close friends with Gu Gayang.The memory of that day made Gu Gayang lose the will to live.Fortunately, thanks to the wealth he kept in a warehouse that only he could open, he managed to maintain some of his wealth, but as a result, Gu Gayang lost his trust on other people.Hearing all the stories, Yu Shinfeng burst out with a sigh.\u201cHoo! To think something like that would happen\u2026 I came to Mister Gu\u2019s house without knowing. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cNo. Even if I don\u2019t believe in others, I believe in Sir Yushin. Rather, you don\u2019t know how reassuring it is to meet someone you can trust like this.\u201d\u201cThank you for saying that.\u201d\u201cBut what\u2019s going on here, Sir Yushin? Are you here because of that day\u2019s incident?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know about the incident not until I heard it from Mister Gu today, so there\u2019s no way I came here because of that. The reason I came to Chengdu is because of another matter.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cMy niece decided to meet someone here, so I came here as her escort and guide.\u201d\u201cCan I know who your niece is going to meet?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t tell you yet. But he\u2019ll be in Chengdu sooner or later, so you\u2019ll find out naturally.\u201d\u201cHeh heh! I\u2019m really curious as to who Sir Yushin is going to meet.\u201dGu Gayang burst into laughter.* * * \u00a0Pyo-wol returned to the guest house.\u201cHow have you been?\u201dThe owner of the guest house immediately recognized Pyo-wol and greeted him.As the only long-term guest at the guest house, and knowing to some extent Pyo-wol\u2019s whereabouts and capabilities, his attitude towards him was unparalleled.Even if the warriors know that Pyo-wol is a terrifying creature, most of them don\u2019t even know his face. However, there were exceptions, and one of them was the owner of the guest house.He was at the scene where the incident happened that day. That\u2019s why he remembered Pyo-wol\u2019s face clearly.When Pyo-wol first came to the inn as a guest, he was so surprised that he didn\u2019t know what to do. He stayed up all night worrying that he might be ripped off to shreds by him. However after being with Pyo-wol for quite some time, he concluded that Pyo-wol was not such a dangerous person.He wasn\u2019t particularly picky, and he didn\u2019t make unreasonable demands.From his outward appearance, no one would guess that he\u2019s capable of doing such a horrible thing. But the owner of the guest house still did not let down his guard.Pyo-wol doesn\u2019t seem like the type of person who will cause problems in the first place, but the off-chance he gets angry, the owner doesn\u2019t have the confidence to handle him.For that reason, the owner of the guest house treated Pyo-wol with utmost respect.Fearing that he might make a mistake, the waiter refused to even come close, so the owner was the one who served Pyo-wol directly.\u201cWould you like to have a meal again today?\u201d\u201cHm.\u201d\u201cSome good fish came in, so how about boiled fish for dinner?\u201d\u201cAlright. Bring it.\u201d\u201cYes! Wait a minute.\u201dThe guest house owner spoke politely and went to the kitchen.Pyo-wol sat in the window seat and looked at the street. This was his favorite spot in the guest house these days. Pyo-wol thought as he looked at the people passing by on the street.\u2018What should I do next?\u2019He did not remain in Chengdu for a particular purpose. He had no intention of staying here. He was just staying here because he hasn\u2019t decided on what he should do next.\u00a0It was easier back then when he had his goal of revenge.Because he didn\u2019t have to think about anything else.But as soon as he took revenge, his goal naturally disappeared.He has been thinking about it since he was in Min River.What he should do next.How he should live.But nothing came to mind.When he was learning martial arts, he didn\u2019t even think of anything else as if his head had been broken. It was as if his mind was empty. Everything felt empty.That was the reason why Pyo-wol was still in Chengdu.But he couldn\u2019t stay here forever.He considered going outside the already familiar Sichuan Province and starting anew.Pyo-wol calmly organized his thoughts and waited for the food to come out.It was then that a loud voice was heard.\u201cOwner! Come on out!\u201dA dwarf hunchback came into the cabin, loudly looking for the owner.Jjalgrung!The chain wrapped around his waist collided with the iron ball, and a clear sound of iron resounded. The owner, who was in the kitchen, came out running scared.\u201cUh, welcome. I\u2019m the owner of the guest house.\u201d\u201cGive me seven good rooms.\u201d\u201cTh, there aren\u2019t that many rooms right now.\u201d\u201cWhat? There aren\u2019t that many guests so how come there\u2019s no room left?\u201d\u201cThere are some people who reserved a room and only come in at night.\u201d\u201cOkay! I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, so either kick out other guests or give them money to get a room.\u201d\u201cOh! No, dont! If you do that, my business will be ruined. If you go over there, a large guest house will appear, so go there. It\u2019s twice as big as us, so there\u2019ll be plenty of room left.\u201d\u201cWhat? Are you telling me to leave? Do you want to die?\u201dAs the hunchback flared his eyes, he gave off a ferocious force.The face of the owner who received his momentum turned white.The hunchback who threatened the owner was the Iron Dwarf.It was impossible for a mere owner of a guest house to bear the momentum of Iron Dwarf who is one of the top masters in Jianghu.The owner of the inn groaned as if he was running out of breath. The Iron Dwarf looked at the face of the owner of the guest house and grinned.The guests murmured while watching the Iron Dwarf.\u00a0Then, the Iron Dwarf yelled.\u201cWhat are you talking about, you bastards! Those who don\u2019t even have the guts are always the one talking behind each other\u2019s backs. So what if you\u2019re tall?! You fucking bastards!\u201dHe spit out swear words without hesitation.The Iron Dwarf had always lived his life the way he wanted to.Being a hunchback from birth, he always suffered from a sense of inferiority.After learning martial arts, he used his sense of inferiority as a driving force to achieve what he is today. But that doesn\u2019t mean that his feeling of inferiority has completely disappeared.His sense of inferiority had always provoked him like a thorn in his chest, and it made him more ferocious.No one could stand his fierce gaze. He felt pleasure in seeing the people in the place where his eyes could reach, turning their heads or bowing.But only one person looked at him without averting his gaze.The moment he saw a man with snow-white skin and a more beautiful appearance than a woman, his anger exploded.\u201cWhat are you looking at? Why aren\u2019t you looking down? Who is that bastard that doesn\u2019t even look like a man?\u201dHope you enjoy the chapter~Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 93": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 93Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAt that moment, the owner of the guest house closed his eyes tightly.\u00a0No one here had seen Pyo-wol longer than him. So he knew better than anyone how scary he could be. It was clear in his eyes what was going to happen now. And his prediction became a reality.Ciiit!A terrifying pounding sound echoed through the guest house.\u201cHuh!\u201dThe Iron Dwarf jerked his head back in surprise at the sudden sound. Suddenly, something sharp ripped through his arm. If he had been a little late to dodge, his forehead would have been pierced.\u201cWhat?\u201dThe Iron Dwarf stared at the man he had cursed a while ago.Ciit!At that moment, another sharp piercing sound came from the back of his head. The Iron Dwarf who thought he had avoided danger was shocked and he hurriedly fell flat on the floor.\u201cKeuk!\u201dSomething passed through his back.Fortunately for him, he avoided it in time so only his clothes and skin were torn, but if he had reacted a little late, his spine would have been severed.\u201cYou!\u201dThe Iron Dwarf hurriedly got up and looked at the man who was more beautiful than the woman.\u00a0There was a small dagger in his hands.The Iron Dwarf instinctively realized that the dagger in the man\u2019s hand was the weapon that wounded his body.The Iron Dwarf released the chain on his waist. The iron ball hanging from the end of the chain rattled.\u201cCrazy bastard! Attacking me all of the sudden? Who are you!?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s something that a person who cursed first should say.\u201dThe man who was sitting in his seat, Pyo-wol, stood up and said.Suddenly, a faint red light appeared in his eyes. Pyo-wol was the type of person who didn\u2019t start a fight, but would not hesitate to fight back if needed.Pyo-wol knew how unrealistic his appearance was. So he knew that many people would look at him with unkind eyes. In particular, the less confident they were in their appearance, the more they were to show off and attack.He wondered what would happen if such people were alone.Huuung!The Iron Dwarf swung his the chain in circles and said,\u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d\u201cYour sense of inferiority is talking too much. It seems that there\u2019s a problem with your mind, rather than your body.\u201d\u201cThis bastard\u2013!\u201dThe Iron Dwarf\u2019s anger exploded.He swung the chain back and forth.Pobobok!The iron ball attached at the end of the chain flew towards Pyo-wol, destroying the objects in the guest house in the process.\u201cOh, my!\u201dThe owner of the guest house closed his eyes tightly and fell to the floor. It was because he couldn\u2019t bear to watch his inn break down any more.\u00a0But he didn\u2019t hear the sound he had imagined.Chwareureuk!It was because Pyo-wol\u2019s hand was holding the chain.\u201cHuh!\u201dWhen the chain failed to show any power and was caught in Pyo-wol\u2019s hand, the Iron Dwarf was freaked out.At that moment, Pyo-wol pulled the iron ball sharply. Then, the Iron Dwarf who was attached to the chain bounced out of the window.Then, Pyo-wol flew away.\u201cYou son of a\u2026!\u201dThe Iron Dwarf who had been thrown on the floor jumped up.\u00a0His anger has reached its climax. The Iron Dwarf injected his internal qi and swung the chain.Kwakwakwa!The iron ball flew toward Pyo-wol with a tremendous momentum that could not be compared with before.The Heaven\u2019s Iron Ball.1It was the name of the martial artist he had learned.Heaven\u2019s Iron Ball was literally the ultimate martial art of crushing even the sky with an iron ball. The iron ball loaded with inner strength had the power to turn even a rock the size of a house into powder at once.\u201cGo to hell!\u201dThe Iron Dwarf angrily roared.That was then.Pyo-wol\u2019s body seemed to float in the air like a kite filled with the wind, and then he jumped on the iron ball that flew at frightening speed.\u201cHck!\u201dHe was so surprised that he felt like his heart was about to drop. Until now, he had crushed and killed many enemies with his steel ball, but this has never happened before.Tata that!Pyo-wol kicked the iron ball and sprinted up the chain. In a brief moment when he could barely take a breath, Pyo-wol reached the front of the Iron Dwarf.The eyes of Pyo-wol and Iron Dwarf met mid-air.In an instant, the Iron Dwarf\u2019s face turned white.It was because the moment he looked at Pyo-wol\u2019s eyes, which had no emotion, he felt a pain as if he was poked in the eyes with an awl.Puk!At that moment, the dagger Pyo-wol was holding was deeply embedded into the shoulder of the Iron Dwarf.\u201cKeueuk!\u201dThe Iron Dwarf tried to pull out the dagger in a hurry. But before he could, Pyo-wol waved his hand, then the body of the Iron Dwarf flew through the air.He threw the Iron Dwarf using the Soul-Reaping Thread.\u00a0Pyo-wol once again waved his hand toward the dagger floating in the air.Pipipit!The ghost knives were released one after the other.\u201cShit!\u201dThe Iron Dwarf hurriedly tried to protect his whole body by desperately releasing his technique, the Heaven\u2019s Iron Ball.\u00a0\u00a0However, it was impossible in the first place to perfectly unfold a technique at a high level while in the air where there was no place for their foot to step on.Eventually, a gap was revealed, and a ghost knife was stuck like a viper.Pobobok!\u201cKeuok!\u201dThe Iron Dwarf screamed as he fell.Pyo-wol was about to throw another ghost dagger to finish off when,\u201cPut that dagger in your hand.\u201d\u201cStop!\u201d\u201cIron Dwarf!\u201dDifferent voices rang out, and six people immediately surrounded the Iron Dwarf.One person held the falling Iron Dwarf, while the other five each wielded their own weapons and struck down the ghost dagger.The oldest among them looked at the appearance of the Iron Dwarf. He got angry and said,\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened between the two of you, but you, young man, your hands are too much.\u201dAn elderly person with impressive eyes and eyebrows raised to the sky was Sa Hyo-kyung, the leader of the Seven Stars. His martial arts was so strong that he was nicknamed the Storm Fire Dragon.2Those who appeared with Sa Hyo-kyung were the rest of the members of the Seven Stars.Jeong Sanwi, the Poison-Bellied Sword.3Jae Woong-pyeong, the Reckless Shadow.4Yo Sulyeong, the Bloody Witch.5Gam Ilhae, the Bamboo Leaf Swordsman.6Cho Samcheok, the Mad Blood-Spraying Swordsman.7Each and every one of them are masters considered at the top of Jianghu. All of them were currently glaring at Pyo-wol while protecting the Iron Dwarf.Pyo-wol flicked his hand. Immediately, all the ghost daggers that were either stuck in Iron Dwarf\u2019s body or were lying on the floor were recovered.Sa Hyo-kyung was quite surprised. They didn\u2019t see Pyo-wol holding anything.\u00a0Then his expression darkened.While he might not know the identity of the opponent, he knew that he was a master who could not be ignored. Above all, the opponent instantly neutralized and subdued his junior brother, Iron Dwarf.A person with that level of prowess should not be looked down upon.\u201cReveal your identity, why did you attack my junior brother? Attacking my junior brother is an attack on the entire Seven Stars. I will never forgive you unless you have a good reason.\u201dSa Hyo-kyung\u2019s voice echoed through the streets.People on the street buzzed in surprise.They weren\u2019t familiar with the name of the Seven Stars, but Sa Hyo-kyung\u2019s spirit was so fierce that they thought they came from a great sect.In fact, the Seven Stars had a great reputation in the vicinity of Hunan. All of the seven martial artists were so great that there were some sects who gave way just by hearing the name of the Seven Stars.Sa Hyo-kyung did not think it would have such an effect in Sichuan, which is far from Hunan. However, he expected the opponent to feel some pressure.However, the effect he expected did not appear.\u201cSo you\u2019re with the hunchback, right?\u201dThe bright red light in Pyo-wol\u2019s eyes grew deeper.Sa Hyo-kyung realized that his actions only had the opposite effect.Many of Jianghu\u2019s warriors showed respect for the name of the Seven Stars, but it didn\u2019t work at all for this beautiful man in front of him. Either he willingly ignores the Seven Stars itself, or he has never even heard of the name of the Seven Stars.Sa Hyo-kyung thought it would be the latter.If the opponent had only stayed in Sichuan for a long time, it was understandable that he did not know the name of the Seven Stars.At that time, a woman in her early to mid thirties who was examining the appearance of the Iron Dwarf came forward to Sa Hyo-kyung.\u201cStop it, oraboni.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by stop?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you realize? That Iron Dwarf was the first one to cause a riot and this mess happened. He must have acted arbitrarily again and brought that man\u2019s anger.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201dSa Hyo-kyung stuttered.He, too, thought that the Iron Dwarf would have been the first to pick a fight. But even so, when the Iron Dwarf was hit like that, they could not just act like nothing had happened.The woman glared at Sa Hyo-kyung.If another woman had acted like that, Sa Hyo-kyung would never have let it go. He was a very authoritative person. Neither men nor women would ever be allowed to challenge his authority.However, the story is different if the opponent is Yo Sulyeong, the Bloody Witch.She was the fifth member and the only woman of the Seven Stars. Not only Sa Hyo-kyung, but all the men in Seven Stars loved her.The reason why the Iron Dwarf tried to buy accessories at the market and made a fuss to get a room at the guest house was all to show off in front of Yo Sulyeong.The Iron Dwarf was highly devoted to Yo Sulyeong, but Yo Sulyeong didn\u2019t like his behavior.\u00a0No, it would be more appropriate to say that she actually hated it.She didn\u2019t like the fact that the Iron Dwarf was showing his love towards her. She was tired of feeling his eyes on her skin.She hated it all the more because he caused an incident like this.\u00a0Although she was given the eerie nickname of the Bloody Witch, Yo Sulyeong was actually a recognizable beauty.What made her bewitching face even more accentuated was her curvaceous body. The appearance of her wearing a tight-fitting outfit to reveal her body was enough to attract men on the street.Yo Sulyeong looked at Pyo-wol with her eyes slightly raised.For a moment, her eyes fluttered.\u2018What kind of man\u2026\u2019Pyo-wol\u2019s beautiful appearance shook her heart.Comparing the warriors of the Seven Stars to Pyo-wol, they all loook like a dried up octopus.Yo Sulyeong said with a bewitching smile,\u201cI\u2019m sorry for the trouble caused by the Iron Dwarf. I apologize on his behalf. I\u2019m Yo Sulyeong of the Seven Stars. Everyone calls me the Bloody Witch. Oh, don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m not called that way because I\u2019m a bad person. What is the name of this Young Sir?\u201d\u201cPyo-wol.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a cool name, as much as your appearance. Anyway, since our Iron Dwarf was the one at fault, we apologize. We\u2019d also like to step back for today. Of course, we will compensate for all the damage he caused. This is a pretty good offer for you too, isn\u2019t it?\u201dYu Sulyeong\u2019s words were polite and persuasive.Pyo-wol nodded his head without saying a word.If he decides to fight, he can fight as much as he wants, but in that case, the town of Chengdu, which has barely regained stability, will be destroyed again.No matter how much Pyo-wol doesn\u2019t care about other people, he didn\u2019t want to repeat that situation twice.Pyo-wol went back into the guest house.\u00a0Then Sa Hyo-kyung asked Yo Seol-young.\u201cWhat do you think? Are you also fascinated by that pretty guy\u2019s face?\u201d\u201cHo-ho! Why? Can\u2019t I do that?\u201d\u201cKkeeeung!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Oraboni! It\u2019s not like that. There\u2019s just something that bothers me.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Chengdu\u2019s atmosphere.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s strangely stagnant. There are sects in Chengdu, and it\u2019s a place where the influence of the Emei and Qingcheng sect is strong, but I don\u2019t feel that kind of atmosphere.\u201d\u201cCome to think of it\u2026\u201dSa Hyo-kyung agreed with Yo Sulyeong.While the Seven Stars is famous in the vicinity of Hunan, in Sichuan they have no choice but to be careful. This is because they are far from their territory, and powerful sects such as the Qingcheng and Emei sect are in charge.\u00a0Because of that, when they entered the city, they were very nervous and wary.However, the atmosphere inside Chengdu was completely different from what they had imagined.The warriors and disciples of the Qingcheng and Emei sect were nowhere to be found, and the members of the other sects could hardly be found.It is as if the number of warriors in Chengdu have thinned out.\u00a0Yo Sulyeong looked around the streets of Chengdu with cool eyes and said,\u201cSomething must have definitely happened here. We can\u2019t rush into a conflict until we know the truth.\u201dHope you enjoy the chapter~Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 94": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 94Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cThe Shadowless Monk Yu Shinfeng, his niece, and the Seven Stars entered the city?\u201d\u201cYes! It was confirmed that they all came in last night.\u201dHong Yushin, the chief inspector of Hao Clan, became serious as he listened to the report.\u201cDid you find out why they came to Chengdu?\u201d\u201cSorry, I haven\u2019t been able to check it out due to lack of time. But I have identified an unusual trend.\u201d\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u201cAs soon as the Seven Stars entered Chengdu,they had a clash with a particular man.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 Pyo-wol.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dHong Yushin expressed curiosity.Recently, the Hao Clan\u2019s biggest interest has been Pyo-wol. Although they had no direct contact with him for fear of conflict, his whereabouts were constantly being investigated.After making direct contact with Pyo-wol, Hong Yushin was shocked. It was not simply because Pyo-wol\u2019s martial arts were strong or intimidating.It was because someone like Pyo-wol appeared so suddenly as if he had fallen from the sky.No matter how powerful he is, it was close to impossible for a person with skill and competence like a Pyo-wol to pop out without any background.Jianghu\u2019s martial arts have developed over the past several hundred years. For that reason, no matter how excellent and talented the person, it was impossible to sincerely learn martial arts without the proper guidance of a teacher.In fact, the warriors who stood out in the current Jianghu, without exception, have a strong sect as their background. So it was no wonder they were strong.\u00a0But Pyo-wol was different.His school or sect of origin were unclear. Still, the martial arts he practiced were terribly strong. It was something that Hong Yushin could not understand with his common sense.So Hong Yushin did not leave the city, and remained in charge of Pyo-wol\u2019s background investigation. In addition, it was necessary to reinforce the organization of the Chengdu branch, which was a mess\u00a0 due to the vacancy of the former branch manager.There are many things to do here and there, but this time, the Shadowless Monk, her niece, and even the Seven Stars entered Chengdu.Moreover, the Seven Stars even collided with Pyo-wol.\u201cThe result?\u201d\u201cIt is said that Oh Kyung-wol, the Iron Dwarf, was greatly humiliated.\u201d\u201cI knew it, it\u2019s not that he was weak. That person was just terribly strong.\u201dHong Yushin laughed.The fact that he was not alone was so refreshing.\u00a0The Hao clan had strict control over information about Pyo-wol.Since it is impossible to shut everyone\u2019s mouth, information about him will gradually become known to the world, but outside of Sichuan, Pyo-wol was close to obscurity. That\u2019s why this incident happened.After a while, he asked his subordinate,\u201cBut why did the Seven Stars come to Chengdu? It\u2019s a completely different area from their usual activities. I know that they don\u2019t have a connection here.\u201d\u201cWe haven\u2019t figured out why yet.\u201d\u201cFind out as much as you can.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dThe subordinate left after answering.Hong Yushin, who was left alone, murmured.\u201cThe winds and waves are constant in Sichuan.\u201dHe didn\u2019t feel good about it.The damp air just before the torrential rain seemed to cover his body. Whenever he felt like this, something bad would happen.* * *Tang Sochu got up early in the morning and put firewood in the furnace.Whether the craftsman was working or taking a break, the fire had to be maintained at all times. When the fire of the brazier goes out, it means that the life of the workshop will end soon.Tang Sochu stared blankly at the flames of the brazier burning again.Having his own studio like this and having an environment where he can work to his heart\u2019s content sometimes felt like a dream.Something unimaginable just a few months ago has happened.\u201cHoo!\u201dAfter staring at the flames for a long time, Tang Sochu sighed and got up from his seat.Tang Sochu headed to the front of the workbench.Pieces of thin wrought iron plates were scattered on the workbench.\u00a0These are the things that Tang Sochu has put a lot of effort into over the past few days. Although it is said to be soft iron, it has excellent strength because it was a blend of several other metals.In order to complete the wrist armor that Pyo-wol ordered, he first made a skeleton or a frame of the soft iron plate.The soft iron plate had to move smoothly enough not to interfere with the movement of the hand, but it also had to have strong durability to protect the arm from the sharpness of a blade.None of the workshops in Chengdu had the skills to make such a wrought iron plate, and no craftsman was so skillful.In the end, Tang Sochu had to do it all by himself from start to finish.Fortunately, his efforts of the past few days were not wasted, and he managed to create a soft iron plate which he liked. Now, all that remains is to connect each wrought iron plate and add leather on top.Tang Sochu moved to the back of the workshop.There was an old, shabby warehouse at the back of the workshop. The old craftsman who was the previous owner stored various iron ingots and materials in that warehouse which was attached to the workshop.The old craftsman handed over the ingredients from the warehouse to Tang Sochu at once. Most of the materials in the warehouse were cheap iron ingots, but if he searched really well, he would occasionally find useful items.Tang Sochu opened the warehouse door, hoping that it would be the same again this time.Squeak!The rusty hinges squeaked, revealing the scenery inside the warehouse.The inside of the warehouse was so dark that even in broad daylight, it was only possible to distinguish the shape by lighting a lamp.Tang Sochu leaned on a lamp and searched the warehouse.After searching for a while, he finally found what he was looking for.\u201cOkay! There\u2019s still some useful stuff left.\u201dWhat he held in his hand was thick leather. The area of the leather was still quite large perhaps because it was not yet cut. If it was this size, it seemed that there would be a large amount left even after making the wristbands.Tang Sochu tried to come out again with only two pieces of leather.\u201cHm?\u201dBut a strange movement was caught in his eyes.Something moved deep inside the warehouse. He could have easily mistaken the shadow as the shaking movement of the lantern, but Tang Sochu had a gut feeling that wasn\u2019t the case.Even though he didn\u2019t learn martial arts, he was still a man who inherited the blood of the Tang Family. His eyesight and physical strength were far superior to that of an ordinary person.\u00a0Without fear, he walked to the spot where he detected the strange movement.\u201cWho are you?\u201dHe lit the corner of the warehouse with a lamp. Then he saw someone crouching in the corner of the warehouse.He was a boy who looked only about six years old. He looked just like a kitten, curled up. His face was covered in ashes and dust from how much he had suffered, and his bare body was revealed through his torn clothes.Tang Sochu frowned.\u201cWho are you? How did you get in here?\u201dDespite the question from Tang Sochu, the boy kept his mouth firmly shut and shrank even further. At the sight of an intruder with a lot of blades, Tang Sochu had a dumbfounded expression on his face.\u201cDamn! What?\u201dHe wanted to forcefully pull him out, but seeing him so vigilant, it didn\u2019t seem like he was going to be pulled out easily. But he couldn\u2019t leave him alone like this.It would not be strange if the skinny and dry thing passed out at any moment.Tang Sochu looked at the boy for a moment, then sighed and went out of the warehouse.After a while, he returned and had a tray of food in his hand.\u201cI\u2019m leaving this here, so eat it.\u201dAfter putting the tray in front of the boy, he went outside.Now it was the boy\u2019s choice whether to eat it or not.Tang Sochu shifted his attention away from the boy and returned to the workshop. He then immersed himself in the work of cutting the leather.Fortunately, the leather found in the warehouse was well tanned, so no special care is required.Tang Sochu treated the leather with a generous amount of special chemicals. The chemical made with the Tang Family\u2019s recipe will make the leather soft and tough.It took quite a while for the chemical to be completely absorbed into the leather.Tang Sochu decided to make and use a silver thread to connect the wrought iron plates, leaving the leather alone. The work of making silver thread was rather more difficult than the work of making wrought iron plates. For that reason, special patience and special craftsmanship were required.Once the iron ingot was melted, a thick wire was created. The wire was heated again, twisted like a pretzel, and elongated.A special treatment was applied to the surface by repeating such an operation several times.\u201cHuuu!\u201dTang Sochu wiped the sweat from his forehead and looked at the result.A thin yet long wire was completed. However, it was far from reaching Tang Sochu\u2019s goal.Tang Sochu intended to make the wire at least three times thinner. He was going to leave it like this for a day to make it hard, while the rest of the work would be done tomorrow.That was then.He had the feeling that someone was watching him secretly.When he turned around just in case, he saw someone running behind him from the back of the workshop.It was the boy hiding in the warehouse.Tang Chou did not dare to follow the boy.He himself had a hard time with people\u2019s persistent gaze, so he knew that not paying attention in this case would help.The next day, Tang Sochu returned to work after bringing food to the warehouse where the boy was hiding.While he was busy working, he felt a warm gaze.A boy hiding in the warehouse is secretly watching him.Tang Sochu continued the work without paying any attention to the boy.The tedious work of twisting the wire dozens of times like a pretzel and heating it up again continued throughout the day.\u201cHoo\u2026!\u201dFinally, as the sun went down, athread of his desired strength and thickness was created. A thread with a thickness of only three or four hairs was rolled up and placed on the workbench.It is thin enough to be indistinguishable with the naked eye, but has excellent strength and elasticity.It was a piece that could not break easily.Tang Sochu smiled with satisfaction.Tang Sochu, who had been appreciating his work for a moment, looked back. The boy who was spying on him previously was nowhere to be seen.Tang Sochu headed to the warehouse.All the food given in the morning was empty. After collecting the bowls, Tang Sochu went into a small room next to the workshop.After a simple dinner, he fell asleep.A rattling sound was heard outside. It looked like someone was rummaging through the kitchen.Tang Sochu smiled and fell asleep.When he woke up in the morning, Tang Sochucould not hide his absurd expression.It was because the boy who had been hiding in the warehouse right next to him was sleeping curled up. He was a boy who looked much younger than he thought.His hands and feet were swollen and his clothes were all torn, proving that the boy was in bad shape.Luckily, he had eaten food for the past two days, so he gained some weight on his skinny skin.\u00a0Even so he barely managed to escape the crisis of starvation.Tang Sochu looked at the boy for a moment and then came out.After making a simple breakfast, he put leftovers in the boy\u2019s sleeping room.Now he had to finish the clasps.He sat on the workbench and connected the wrought iron plates one by one with the thread. It was a job that required finesse.After tedious work without blinking an eye, he finally connected all the wrought iron plates. The work was done by overlaying the leather on the completed frame.After nearly half a day of work, he finally got a pair of wrist armor.On the surface, it was just an ordinary tossie with a layer of leather. He thought he was being too modest, but then he shook his head.Because he knows that what Pyo-wol really cares about is practicality.Tang Sochu wrapped the finished wrist armor with cloth and headed out.Before leaving the door, he said to the person inside of the house.\u201cI\u2019ll be out for a while, so if you\u2019re hungry, go search the kitchen and eat.\u201dOf course, there was no answer.It wasn\u2019t something he was expecting to hear anyway, so he closed the door and headed to the guest house where Pyo-wol was staying.During the making of the wrist armors, he never came out, so much that the sun dazzled his eyes. It\u2019s been a while since he has been outside, but the streets of Chengdu haven\u2019t changed at all.On the contrary, it seemed that there were more people visiting than before.Tang Sochu looked at the people with curiosity.Then he heard the voices of people passing by.\u201cYou still haven\u2019t found him?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure he entered Chengdu but I can\u2019t find his whereabouts after that.\u201d\u201cHeh! That\u2019s quite annoying.\u201d\u201cSo, how about submitting a request to the Hao clan? They would be able to find him easily.\u201d\u201cDid you forget the terms the client gave us? They told us to do the job secretly. I can\u2019t trust the Hao clan guys because they\u2019re so sly.\u201d\u2018\u201cHmm!\u201dThose who were talking were a bewitching woman with raised eyebrows and a warrior with a sword like a bamboo around his waist.They continued to talk without being aware that Tang Sochu was nearby. Tang Sochu paid them no attention.This is because he knows well that useless curiosity in Jianghu could only hastened his demise.He walked diligently and arrived at the guest house where Pyo-wol was staying.\u201cBrother!\u201dPyo-wol was sitting in the window seat on the first floor of the guest house.Pyo-wol, who was drinking tea alone, looked at him.Tang Sochu sat down across from him and put down the wrist armor wrapped in cloth.\u201cI finished it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 95": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 95Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen the cloth was unwrapped, a pair of wrist armors appeared.The form was simple, but he could tell that it was high-quality work.Pyo-wol wore his wrist armor without saying a word. The cold touch of metal was not felt because of the leather.Pyo-wol moved his arms back and forth while wearing the armor. There was no sense of alienation or suffocation. It felt light and comfortable to move in as if he was wearing silk clothes.Tang Sochu explained,\u201cThere will be no inconvenience in moving with the wrist armor, and if you use your internal energy, you will be able to easily block any number of weapons.\u201d\u201cWell made. This is really nice.\u201d\u201cOf course. I put a lot of effort into making it.\u201dWhen Pyo-wol seemed satisfied, Tang Sochu smiled lightly.The happiest moment for the artisan was when the client was satisfied. More so if the client could draw more than ten percent of the use of the work he had made. If it was Pyo-wol, he would surely be able to properly use his work he put so much effort into.Tang Sochu was satisfied with that.\u201cWhat more do you need?\u201d\u201cNothing for now.\u201d\u201cTake this.\u201dTang Sochu pulled out a thread from his arms and handed it to Pyo-wol.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the leftovers from making the wrist armor. It\u2019s very elastic and strong, so it\u2019ll definitely be useful.\u201dPyo-wol received the thread.Wielding the Soul-Reaping Thread did not require any special thread. However, if he has such a piece of equipment, there will surely come a day when it will come in handy.Pyo-wol confirmed the strength and elasticity of the thread. As Tang Sochu said, it seemed like the thread could be used at any time. Pyo-wol said as he put thread in his bosom,\u201cGood! I\u2019ll use it well.\u201d\u201cOkay then. I\u2019ll go ahead now.\u201d\u201cAre you leaving already?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s an uninvited guest at home. I\u2019ll go and check what\u2019s going on.\u201d\u201cUninvited customer?\u201d\u201cSomething like that. I\u2019ll go now.\u201dTang Sochu smiled slightly at Pyo-wol and left the guest house. Pyo-wol looked at the back of Tang Sochu as he left the door without a word.That was then.\u201cDo you know him well?\u201dThe strong body odor along with the unfamiliar voice stimulated Pyo-wol\u2019s senses. Pyo-wol turned around and saw a woman with a slender body and a sensual appearance who was looking and smiling at him.It was Yo Sulyeong, a member of the Seven Stars. With the Iron Dwarf right beside her.The Iron Dwarf was glaring at Pyo-wol with fierce eyes. However, perhaps because of the previous day\u2019s humiliation, he could not easily provoke Pyo-wol and he had to forcibly suppress his anger.Yo Sulyeong left behind the Iron Dwarf and sat across from Pyo-wol. Then, she placed her chin on her palm and looked at Pyo-wol with a deep expression.The moment she expressed her interest in Pyo-wol, the Iron Dwarf became furious.\u201cSister! Why are you talking to someone like him?!\u201d\u201cShut up, dwarf! Why does it matter who I talk to?\u201d\u201cHa, but\u2013\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, so be quiet.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dThe Iron Dwarf could only reply helplessly to Yo Sulyeong Yo\u2019s harsh words.\u00a0To some extent, the appearance of the Iron Dwarf looked pitiful. Anyone could see that he had a crush on Yo Sulyeong. On the other hand, Yo Sulyeong was completely set in ignoring him, saying that she had no interest in the Iron Dwarf.As the Iron Dwarf was quiet, Yo Sulyeong gave Pyo-wol a gentle gaze again.\u201cI\u2019m sorry for making so much noise\u2013\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cOh! You have a quick temper. Are you going to be so blunt even if a beautiful woman like me is talking to you?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re going to keep saying such useless things, go away.\u201d\u201cYou have a very rough personality. I\u2019ll forgive you because you\u2019re handsome though.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cWe recently found out that you\u2019re an amazing person. I apologize on behalf of this dwarf who did not recognize such a great master.\u201dYo Sulyeong revealed her white teeth and smiled lightly.It has already been several days since the Seven Stars entered the city. That was enough time for them to know about the identity of Pyo-wol.Outside of Sichuan, Pyo-wol was close to unknown, but within the city, he was a celebrity. It\u2019s just that the warriors are reluctant to mention his name because of their fear.However, the pointed awl would always come out of the pocket, and with a little care, it was not difficult to hear rumors about Pyo-wol.\u201cYou really don\u2019t believe in such false rumors, do you?\u201dAlthough the Iron Dwarf considered the rumors to be false, Sa Hyo-kyung, the leader of the Seven Stars, thought that the rumors were true to some extent.It was because he could see the visible fear on the faces of the warriors he was talking to.Sa Hyo-kyung urged his sister and brothers to be extra careful when dealing with Pyo-wol.The reason why the Seven Stars secretly entered Chengdu was to fulfill someone\u2019s request, not to cause a conflict.It was unexpected for the Emei sect and Qingcheng sect to lock their doors and stop their external activities, but on the other hand, it was also an opportunity for them.Because if those two great sects were active, it would have been impossible for them to act so freely within Chengdu.Yo Sulyeong looked at Pyo-wol with curious eyes.She wasn\u2019t still fully convinced by the rumors, but even if she only half-believed it, it was clear that Pyo-wol was a great warrior.The Iron Dwarf who was standing right next to her might have a hunchback figure, but he was still a great warrior. And for Pyo-wol to easily subdue such a warrior proves that the rumors about him were true to some extent.Yo Sulyeong leaned closer to Pyo-wol.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that dwarf. He\u2019s no good at all.\u201d\u201cIs he different from you?\u201d\u201cHo-ho! Are you kidding me? I would be sad if you treated me the same as that dwarf.\u201dYo Sulyeong broke into laughter.With every move she makes, her big breasts would sway greatly, making the Iron Dwarf beside her look at her with ecstasy. Just by looking at the Iron Dwarf, a person could tell how much he longed for Yo Sulyeong.\u00a0But Yo Sulyeong didn\u2019t think and care about him as much as he did.\u00a0\u201cIf you want, I\u2019ll let you experience how helpful I can be. How about it?\u201d\u2018\u201cThat\u2019s interesting.\u201d\u201cHo-ho! You have an eye for people, too.\u201dYo Sulyeong\u2019s smile deepened, while the Iron Dwarf had a miserable expression.\u2018That bastard dares to\u2014\u2019The Iron Dwarf\u2019s eyes were full of anger as he stared at Pyo-wol.If he could kill a person with just his eyes, he would have already killed Pyo-wol dozens of times. However, Pyo-wol did not care about his gaze and asked Yo Sulyeong.\u201cWhy did you come to Chengdu?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m looking for someone.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d\u201cHo-ho! Do you want to hear the secret of our group? I\u2019ll tell you when you join the Seven Stars.\u201d\u201cNo thanks.\u201d\u201cWhy? Don\u2019t you like me?\u201d\u201cI like you, but I think I\u2019ll be beaten to death by the Iron Dwarf if I get close to you.\u201dPyo-wol pointed the tip of his chin at the Iron Dwarf Then Yo Sulyeong burst into laughter.\u201cHo-ho! Are you afraid of that dwarf? You\u2019re good at making funny jokes.\u201d\u201cYou can think of it as a joke, but don\u2019t bother me anymore.\u201d\u201cWhy? Am I annoying?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dYo Sulyeong froze as she didn\u2019t expect Pyo-wol\u2019s words.It was the first time she had been treated like this. All the men tried to look good to her in some way, but there was not a single one who ignored her like this.Pyo-wol got up from his seat and said,\u201cI don\u2019t know why you came to Chengdu, but stay quiet. Don\u2019t let me get involved in troublesome things for nothing.\u201d\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t like it?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll find out then. How the Qingcheng and Emei sect ended in that state.\u201dAt Pyo-wol\u2019s words, Yo Sulyeong closed her lips firmly.Her face was full of humiliation.\u201cHow dare you talk like that to Yo Sulyeong!\u201dThe Iron Dwarf was furious and tried to attack Pyo-wol. But Yo Sulyeong raised her hand and stopped him.\u201cDon\u2019t get too excited, you idiot!\u201d\u201cSister!\u201d\u201cIf you keep getting involved in my business like this, I won\u2019t go with you.\u201d\u201cI\u2026O, Okay.\u201dThe Iron Dwarf answered weakly.Yo Sulyeong looked at Pyo-wol while smiling as if she didn\u2019t feel humiliated.\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll keep your words in mind. But just know this one thing. This little guy is by no means easy-going. The day will surely come when you will kneel at my feet and crave for my affection.\u201d\u201cWhen you\u2019re done talking, go ahead. I want some quiet.\u201d\u201cSee you next time.\u201dYo Sulyeong got up from her seat with a bewitching smile.When she left, the hall became quiet.Pyo-wol, who was left alone, murmured.\u201cDid she come here to test me?\u201dYo Sulyeong acted as if she had been hurt by Pyo-wol, but Pyo-wol managed to see through her facade. Yo Sulyeong was blocking Pyo-wol\u2019s intervention by showing that she had a crush on Pyo-wol.Because no man will interfere with the work of a woman who has a crush on him. Moreover, it goes without saying if the woman was as beautiful as Yo Sulyeong.In short, it means that everything Yo Sulyeong showed was thoroughly calculated.\u201cShe\u2019s planning something.\u201dThere was a slight crease in the middle of Pyo-wol\u2019s forehead.He wanted to avoid getting involved in useless things as much as possible. So, in matters not related to him, he took the attitude of a bystander thoroughly. But this time, he had a feeling that wasn\u2019t going to happen.Pyo-wol knew that his intuition was very good.In particular, the more it was related to him, the more his premonition was right. Pyo-wol thought that he should find out more about the Seven Stars.Although he knew well about the warriors of Sichuan through the Chengdu\u2019s Directory of Martial Artist, he knew nothing about the warriors from the outside.Pyo-wol got up from his seat.He came out of the guest house and walked towards the street where the lanterns were dyed red.\u201cHo-ho! Come here, three of you. I\u2019ll take good care of you.\u201d\u201cCome this way. I\u2019ll send you to paradise.\u201dIt was the red light district where the laughter of prostitutes did not stop.The red light district was full of men.Still, those who had better pockets went into the brothel exhilaratingly, while those who were timid had to bargain with the receptionist in front of the brothel.The red light district heated up the desires of men and the seduction of prostitutes. However, as soon as Pyo-wol appeared on the street, the heated air quickly cooled.\u201cWhat? That guy\u2026\u201d\u201cAh! Oh my\u2026\u201dThe prostitutes who propped their upper body out of the window, looked at Pyo-wol\u2019s inhuman appearance, deeply mesmerized.\u201cWhat? Where are you looking? These bitches\u2026\u201d\u201cFuck! That\u2019s dirty\u2014\u201dThe men who suddenly lost the attention of the prostitutes to Pyo-wol burst out in anger. However, they could not do anything against Pyo-wol.They knew it too.How deadly that beautiful man was.In Chengdu, the existence of Pyo-wol was associated with fear itself.Pyo-wol entered Water Lily Pavilion1, the largest brothel in the red light district.When Pyo-wol came in, the entire Water Lily Pavilion was in an uproar.\u00a0Most of the courtesans were fighting to enter Pyo-wol\u2019s room, while the general secretary was sweating profusely.Others were sweating in a different way.It was the Water Lily Pavilion\u2019s Luju.\u00a0\u2018Why did he come here? He probably didn\u2019t come here knowing that this is the Hao clan\u2019s base, right?\u2019There were only a few who knew that the Water Lily Pavilion was one of the Hao-clan\u2019s bases.In particular, only a few people in Chengdu knew about it. For the safety of prostitutes, the only one who knew the truth about base made sure to keep quiet about it.Luju thought Pyo-wol\u2019s appearance was just a coincidence and called a courtesan named Cho Hyang.Cho Hyang was the most popular prostitute in the Water Lily Pavilion these days. Not only is she beautiful in appearance, she is also full of aegyo, and if she had a drink at least once, hundreds of men would fall for her.She was also proficient in the Four Arts2\u00a0and was worthy of being called the best courtesan in the Water Lily Pavilion.Cho Hyang bowed her head towards Luju.\u201cYou called for me, Luju?\u201d\u201cDid you hear that a man named Pyo-wol has arrived?\u201d\u201cBecause of him, the whole Water Lily Pavilion was buzzing. Everyone is busy talking about him.\u201d\u201cYou should take care of the man.\u201d\u201cMe? But I have a reservation for another guest tonight.\u201d\u201cHand over that reservation to another child. You should focus on Pyo-wol. Find out at least one more thing about him, anything about his purpose, future course of action, inner intentions or others. That\u2019s what you have to do today.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dIt was then that Cho Hyang realized the seriousness of the situation and nodded.\u201cI believe in you, Cho Hyang!\u201d\u201cJust leave it to me. I\u2019ll bring out all his secrets hidden with my underwear.\u201d\u201cYes. I only trust you.\u201d\u201cDo not worry.\u201dCho Hyang made a confident expression.No one has ever stayed in the right with her.Everyone struggled to get into her skirt, and involuntarily revealed all their secrets.\u201cThat man is mine now.\u201dHope you enjoy the chapter~Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When?\u201d\u201cHalf an hour ago.\u201d\u201cBut why are you reporting this to me now?\u201d\u201cI ran as fast as I could, my Lord!\u201dThe general secretary of Water Lily Pavilion explained, sweating profusely.\u201cDid you find out why he came to the Water Lily Pavilion?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure about that. But Cho Hyang, the best courtesan in the Water Lily Pavilion, was put in, so we\u2019ll be able to find out soon.\u201d\u201cIs the child named Cho Hyang reliable?\u201d\u201cShe is the best courtesan in the Water Lily Pavilion. She is naturally coquettish and has received special training from the headquarters, so she is reliable.\u201d\u201cHm!\u201dHong Yushin frowned and let out a sigh.Cho Hyang was not only outstanding in beauty, but also excellent in martial arts, so she was a talented person that the Hao clan respected.\u00a0Since such a talented person was put in, it was enough to trust and wait. However, Hong Yushin was unable to endure it and got up from his seat.\u201cI will go myself.\u201d\u201cHuh? What?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to go directly to the Water Lily Pavilion and observe the situation.\u201dThere were times in his life when he had a strange feeling of anxiety. It was like that now. Hong Yushin was enveloped in a strangely uneasy feeling.He immediately left his residence and headed for the Water Lily Pavilion.\u201cYou\u2019re here?\u201dThe brothel keeper was the first to greet him.\u201cWhat about him?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s in the Plum Room now.\u201d\u201cA girl named Cho Hyang is dealing with him?\u201d\u201cYes. They\u2019ve been drinking a lot, so I\u2019m sure they\u2019re going to get drunk soon. Then, when Cho Hyang uses the Art of Seduction, he\u2019ll tell her everything he knows.\u201dThe Art of Seduction is a technique passed down to the Hao clan, and it coincides with unmarried wine. If there is something else, it is that it attracts opponents by maximizing the beauty and coquettishness of the user.Cho Hyang was particularly good at the art of seduction. After listening to the explanation, Yushin Hong nodded.\u201cOkay! I\u2019ll be waiting here, so if there\u2019s anything wrong, report it right away.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dThe brothel keeper bowed her head deeply and backed away.Hong Yushin, who was left alone, tapped the table with his finger.\u201cWhy did he come here? Did he really come here by accident, not knowing that this place is the Hao clan base?\u201dA confused expression appeared on Hong Yushin\u2019s face.He waited for the brothel keeper to return with good news. However, even after waiting for one hour and two more hours, the brothel keeper did not return.Eventually, he stayed up all night and greeted the morning. The brothel keeper went to his room with a blank expression on her face.\u201cWhat about him?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cHow did it go?\u201d\u201cThe incense didn\u2019t come out.\u201d\u201cDid you get hurt?\u201d\u201cNo. That\u2019s not it.\u201dThe brothel keeper\u2019s face flushed. Her face was full of embarrassment.This is because Cho Hyang and her partner did not stop their overnight activities in the Plum Room.When she sent her to seduce the man, she fell for him instead and struggled with pleasure all night long.When she asked Cho Hyang, who had been exhausted, if she had found out anything, she just shook her head helplessly.And she just repeated these words.\u201cHe\u2019s not human. Humans\u2026\u201dCho Hyang went back to her residence and fell asleep. She was exhausted because she had been tormented greatly by Pyo-wol.He was exhausted from how much he had been tormented by Pyo-wol.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dThe brothel keeper bowed her head.Hong Yushin suddenly stood up.\u201cI\u2019ll go to him. Guide me!\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cIt seems that he has come to visit me. Please guide me to his room.\u201d\u201cOh, I see.\u201dThe brothel keeper hurriedly guided Hong Yushin.Inside the Plum Room where Pyo-wol was staying, the laughter of courtesans could be heard. Other courtesans were put in instead of Cho Hyang.Hong Yushin opened the door without notice. Then, the situation inside the room was revealed.Pyo-wol was sitting at an angle with his shirt off, and to his left and right, half-naked courtesans were holding his hands.Even though Hong Yushin suddenly came in, there was not a single change in Pyo-wol\u2019s expression. Hong Yushin confirmed that his guess was correct.\u201cYou must have come to see me, right?\u201d\u201cHave a seat.\u201d\u201cHow did you know this place?\u201d\u201cYour body shares the same smell of the courtesans here.\u201d\u201cWere you a dog in a previous life? How is that possible?\u201d\u201cI just can.\u201d\u201cHuh! What an amazing person.\u201dHong Yushin shook his head and sat down in front of Pyo-wol.He nodded to the courtesans. Then the courtesans got up and went out. The faces of the prostitutes were full of regret. In that short time, they were already mesmerized by Pyo-wol.\u201cThat face is a scam, a fraud! If you wear a skirt, anyone will be enchanted. Damn it! Don\u2019t you want to come to the Hao clan? I\u2019ll give you the best treatment.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense and just sit down.\u201d\u201cYes! Yes! But didn\u2019t you threaten to kill me if I approached you? I don\u2019t know if I can sit down.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t sit down, I\u2019ll kill you right away.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll sit down. I\u2019m already sitting down. Damn it!\u201dHong Yushin frowned.It was the first time he\u2019d met someone who made him speechless. He didn\u2019t know it would be so difficult to regain the lost initiative. Hong Yushin muttered as he looked at the messy appearance of Pyo-wol.\u201cLooks like you had a very hot night.\u201d\u201cThey just grabbed me and wouldn\u2019t let go.\u201d\u201cIt seems like I need to re-educate them. I told them to seduce a man, not to stop you from leaving.\u201d\u201cYou take care of that.\u201dPyo-wol\u2019s voice lowered.At the same time, Hong Yushin\u2019s expression hardened like a stone. This is because he felt that from now on, Pyo-wol would come to the main point.\u00a0\u201cTell me about the Seven Stars.\u201d\u201cWhy are you asking about them?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to know.\u201d\u201cThen I can\u2019t tell you.\u201d\u201cLooks like someone wants to die.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s no use taking my head off. Even if I look out of shape. Although the Hao clan looks out of shape, it\u2019s not a place you can just use at your own discretion.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s no use killing me. Even if you kill all the prostitutes here, you won\u2019t get what you want.\u201d\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s make a deal.\u201d\u201cDeal?\u201d\u201cYes! Giving and receiving what each other needs. Shouldn\u2019t there be that much flexibility?\u201d\u201cOkay. Tell me what you want.\u201dWhen Pyo-wol agreed immediately, Hong Yushin felt embarrassed.\u201cHuh? What are you up to? Why are you suddenly being so nice?\u201d\u201cYou said you wanted to make a deal.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, but\u2013\u201dHong Yu-shin blurted out the end of his speech.In an instant, Pyo-wol\u2019s voice lowered.\u201cYou only get one chance, you better think carefully before you speak.\u201d\u00a0\u201cOkay. What is your purpose?\u201d\u201cPurpose?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m asking about your ultimate purpose.\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI never lived with a grand purpose in mind in the first place.\u201d\u201cStill, with your level of achievement and capability, haven\u2019t you dream of becoming a reigning powerhouse?\u201d\u201cI learned martial arts in order to survive. I\u2019ve lived like a savage for revenge, but now that I\u2019m finished with my revenge, nothing remains in my heart. It can be said that all the remaining ones were burned down.\u201dHong Yushin looked intently at Pyo-wol\u2019s face.\u201cYou\u2026 really mean it.\u201d\u201cBecause I have no reason to lie.\u201d\u201cDo you have any other goals?\u201d\u201cNone.\u201d\u201cDo you have any intention of wanting to become the leader of Sichuan?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s annoying!\u201d\u201cHa! This is too much for me.\u201d\u201cI was telling the truth.\u201d\u201cHuu\u2026\u201dHong Yushin sighed once more.He looked disappointed, but he was relieved inside. Because he knew all too well what would happen if someone like Pyo-wol had great ambitions.The more he learned about what Pyo-wol did in Chengdu, the more fearful Hong Yushin felt.From the meticulous planning and preparation, to the determination to actually proceed with his plans, and the powerful martial arts that support him.The more he got to know Pyo-wol, the more similar he was to a disaster.It was by no means a coincidence or luck that the Emei and Qingcheng sect suffered great damage and went into isolation at the same time.\u00a0The existence of Pyo-wolf made it possible to do ridiculous things.So he was afraid. It is because they know how much chaos will occur if such a being has great ambition and plans to become a strong powerhouse. That is why he was not able to leave Chengdu and was keeping a close eye on Pyo-wol.Hong Yushin asked.\u201cWhat do you want to know about the Seven Stars?\u201d\u201cThe purpose for which they came here.\u201d\u201cIf I ask you why you are curious, would you answer me?\u201d\u201cI think their purpose has something to do with me.\u201d\u201cIs that a hunch?\u201d\u201cMy intuition is the reason I have survived until now. My hunch is pretty accurate.\u201d\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s take a look. We were also wondering why they came to Chengdu when they have no connection here whatsoever.\u201dHong Yushin shook his head.He was well aware of how accurate the senses and intuition of martial artist was.Warriors who have reached a high level are able to draw conclusions that cannot be guessed with their excellent insight. This is because they are able to grasp the surrounding environment, atmosphere, and people\u2019s psychology and behavior.People don\u2019t know exactly why and how the warriors came to that conclusion, but most of the conclusions the warriors gave unconsciously were horrifyingly correct.Hong Yushin thought that Pyo-wol was also like that.Pyo-wol might now know exactly why he thinks the Seven Stars\u00a0 would be related to him, but it was clear that he already felt some causal connection with him anyway.\u201cBy the way, isn\u2019t it time for you to return it?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cChengdu\u2019s Directory of Martial Artist. If we can\u2019t retrieve it, we\u2019re going to get in trouble too.\u201dAs soon as Hong Yushin finished speaking, Pyo-wol pulled out a yellow booklet from his bosom and threw it on the table.It was the Chengdu\u2019s Directory of Martial Artist Hong Yushin had been looking for.All the contents in it were kept in Pyo-wol\u2019s head, so he can return it without any regrets.Hong Yushin put the booklet into his arms and said,\u201cIs this enough to say that our relationship has progressed quite a bit?\u201d\u201cYou could say that you escaped from the worst.\u201d\u201cNot bad.\u201dHong Yushin smiled softly.Considering that his first meeting with Pyo-wol was the worst, such progress could be considered a miracle.Hong Yushin got up from his seat and said,\u201cThen go have fun. Oh, you know that the services of the Water Lily Pavilion is quite expensive, right? As long as you pay the bills well, there will be no problem.\u201d\u201cI heard I don\u2019t have to.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about the money, just stay as long as you can.\u201d\u201cWho are you talking about?\u201d\u201cAll the women who came into my room. They begged me to stay because they\u2019ll pay for it at their own expense.\u201d\u201cBastard!\u201dHong Yushin spit out abusive language without knowing it, and then smiled awkwardly.\u201cAh! I didn\u2019t say that to you. It was just\u2014 I just suddenly feel like the world was unfair. Someone else would normally squeeze out all their courage to talk to a woman. But to think it\u2019s too easy for some people\u2026\u201dHong Yushin\u2019s eyes were moist.Pyo-wol looked at Hong Yushin indifferently.Looking at Pyo-wol\u2019s face, Hong Yushin clearly felt how absurd the world was once again.If he was a woman, he felt like he would also have no choice but to untie his skirt the moment he sees his face.\u2018His thing have to be small, they have to be small. If there really is karma in this world, the heavens should balance it out at least that much.\u2019However, his expectations were terribly shattered by the voices of prostitutes from outside.\u201cCho Hyang unnie says it\u2019s amazing.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHis\u2026\u201dHong Yushin closed his eyes tightly.\u2018This bastard\u2026!\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 97": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 97Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cI think I\u2019ve been tricked.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dAt Hong Yushin\u2019s self-talk, the brothel keeper looked at him with a puzzled expression.The chief inspector of the Hao clan was indeed a terrifying position. He had a strong authority to inspect and punish the members of the Hao clan.It was not a place that could be climbed simply by having strong martial arts.Only those who had an excellent brain and broad insight to search for the truth could become the chief inspector. This was because the person who handled the most extensive and deep information in Jianghu was the chief inspector of the Hao Clan.\u00a0So it was natural to find it hard to believe that Hong Yushin had been tricked by someone.A dark shadow fell on Hong Yushin\u2019s eyes.He remembered the moment when he first met Pyo-wol. At that time, none of his negotiations worked for Pyo-wol. The moment he revealed who he was, Pyo-wol reacted immediately.His bloody force, resolute hands, and even a creepy eyes that seemed to penetrate the soul.Hong Yushin was overwhelmed by Pyo-wol\u2019s presence and could not resist. Moreover, Pyo-wol even threatened to kill everyone if the Hao clan approached him.So Hong Yushin was extremely wary, defining Pyo-wol as someone who he could never communicate with.Hong Yushin\u2019s assessment of Pyo-wol reached its peak when Pyo-wol entered the Water Lily Pavilion. But the unexpected visit of Pyo-wol completely destroyed his prior assessment of him.In particular, he became very excited when Pyo-wol obediently accepted the deal he had proposed. It was as if Pyo-wol\u2019s resilient nature that was never going to collapse was an illusion given how it had been torn down. So, he quickly accepted Pyo-wol\u2019s proposal.Until then, he hadn\u2019t thought of it as strange. In any case, he was satisfied with just opening the door to a conversation with a partner who seemed incapable of negotiating.However, as his excitement subsided, he realized that he had not gained anything as a result.\u2018Deal? He\u2019s the only one who benefited from the information he received from me. He actually hasn\u2019t given me anything. He only reassured me by saying he had no ambition, but he might have kept his true feelings hidden. All of this was a picture he drew.\u2019It was scary, no, terrifying.Maybe Pyo-wol had been painting this scenario from the moment he first saw him. In that brief encounter, he might have known who he was and found a way to use him.\u2018As a bonus, he gets to take the courtesans of the Water Lily Pavilion.\u2019It was said that courtesans lined up to enter the Plum Room where Pyo-wol is still staying. Pyo-wol obtained information from Hong Yushin without paying a penny, and was spending a wonderful time at the Water Lily Pavilion.It was like being ripped off all the way to the bottom.\u2018He\u2019s not just a clever fox. A bear with strength and intelligence. But has there ever been such a handsome bear? So is he not a bear? What? This stream of consciousness\u2013\u2019Hong Yushin shook his head to shake off his useless thoughts.Beside him, the brothel keeper was looking at him with a puzzled expression. In her eyes, Hong Yushin looked like a madman talking to himself.Hong Yushin opened his mouth.\u201cTell the members of the Hao clan in Chengdu to monitor the progress of the Seven Stars.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dThe brothel keeper bowed her head deeply and replied.Hong Yushin\u2019s eyes deepened even more.\u2018Seven Stars. Loaches of Jianghu.\u2019* * *All seven warriors of the Seven Stars have gathered in one place.They rented the entire VIP room on the second floor of a particular guest room. All kinds of food were piled up like a mountain on the table where they sat in a circle.The seven warriors of the Seven Stars ate the food laid out on the table without speaking.In particular, the fourth member, Jae Woong-pyeong and the youngest, Cho Samcheok, ate the food at a frightening speed.\u00a0In an instant, the large chicken leg was left with only its bones, and food debris piled up around them.Even Yo Sulyeong, a woman, ate more than most men.So they removed all the food on the table.Sa Hyo-kyung said while sucking the grease off his fingers through her mouth,\u201cNow, time is running out. We must find him.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve confirmed that he has entered Chengdu. It seems that he is scared and is hiding somewhere, but it will be easy to find him in a week.\u201dThe person who answered was Jeong Sanwi, the second member of the Seven Stars. The nickname of the Jeong Sanwi was the Poison-Bellied Sword.He boasted of an insidious mind and excellent intelligence, like his nickname which means that he had a sword hidden in his stomach.Sa Hyo-kyung\u2019s gaze turned to Yo Sulyeong.\u201cWhat about him?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s quiet.\u201d\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\u201cYes. I went with the dwarf and tested him out, but he didn\u2019t seem interested in what we do.\u201d\u201cKeep an eye on his movements. I don\u2019t think the rumors about him are false.\u201dGam Ilhae was astonished at Sa Hyo-kyung\u2019s words.\u201cThen you mean the rumors are true? The fact that the Qingcheng and Emei sect suffered a lot of damage because of him.\u201d\u201cI cross-checked the information with the warriors of the White Flower Room and Golden Gates, so I\u2019m sure!\u201d\u201cHmm!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to believe. I was like that too but the rumors are all true. I don\u2019t know how such a being was born, but there is a monster that denies common sense in Chengdu.\u201d\u201cSo what should we do? Are you just going to avoid him like this? No matter how strong he is, if we all gather our strength, we will be able to handle him easily.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of efficiency. If we can solve a problem without provoking him, there\u2019s no reason to clash.\u201d\u201cOkay. If that\u2019s how it is\u2026\u201dGam Ilhae agreed.Sa Hyo-kyung\u2019s gaze turned to Yo Sulyeong.\u201cMake sure you keep a tight hold on him so he won\u2019t get involved in our matters.\u201d\u201cHo-ho! In that case, leave it to me.\u201dWhen Yo Sulyeong gave a bewitching smile, the Iron Dwarf became restless.\u201cOh, it\u2019s not even necessary for you to go as far as\u2026\u201d\u201cDistinguish between public and private. Didn\u2019t you almost crash with him again the other day?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, leader!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a quest from a sect in the east, not anywhere else. If we successfully complete this quest, we\u2019ll be able to step forward as a group in the region beyond Hunan.\u201dSa Hyo-kyung\u2019s eyes were full of ambition.The Seven Stars was not as powerful as its reputation.Because it was made up of only seven people.Although the individual\u2019s forces are strong, they were only active in Hunan because they are not supported by any financial or military power.But if they successfully complete this commission, the client will fill in the missing part.\u201cSo, we have to catch him and go back. If that\u2019s not possible, we have to kill him and completely destroy the evidence. Keep in mind what I\u2019m saying! This is a great opportunity, but if it goes wrong, it\u2019s a shortcut to our total destruction.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dThe six brothers answered in unison.Only then did Sa Hyo-kyung smile with satisfaction.He trusted his brothers.Although they were born on different dates, they trusted and depended on each other enough to swear to die on the same day.\u2018No one will be able to stop us.\u2019Since the six brothers and one sister were united, they were not afraid of anything.* * *Pyo-wol used the Plum Room as if it were his own room.Even though he was locked in the room, no one said anything.In the meantime, Cho Hyang, the top courtesan of the Water Lily Pavilion, lived in a Plum Room and took care of Pyo-wol.Many courtesans tried to aim for Pyo-wol, but most of them were blocked by Cho Hyang, so they could not achieve their goals.Pyo-wol was reading a book, while leaning against a soft blanket. Cho Hyang was sitting modestly beside him.When Pyo-wol opened his mouth slightly, Cho Hyang hurriedly put a piece of fruit she had cut in front of him.\u201cHow does it taste?\u201d\u201cGood.\u201d\u201cI specifically asked the merchant to bring it in this morning. It\u2019s fresh and tastes good.\u201dCho Hyang acted coquettishly and rubbed her chest against Pyo-wol\u2019s forearm. Anyone could see how hard she had fallen for Pyo-wol.In fact, Cho Hyang was deeply in love with Pyo-wol.It felt like her soul was satisfied just by looking at him.She was mesmerized by his beautiful appearance and skin that rivals a woman, and deep red eyes that seemed to see through everything.The brothel keeper and the chief inspector\u2019s warnings were no longer in her mind. All she had in her mind was Pyo-wol.How can I make this guy look and embrace me?That\u2019s all she had been thinking about all day.If Pyo-wol showed her even a small smile, she was even willing to sell her soul. But Pyo-wol remained indifferent, never showing a smile.Of course, it was okay.It was both okay and scary at the same time.After entering the Plum Room, Pyo-wol did nothing after grabbing a book.It started when he accidentally found a music sheet that was stuck in a corner of the Plum Room.\u00a0The courtesans had to be good at the Four Arts1\u00a0so they always lived with related and relevant books nearby. The music sheet that Pyo-wol was reading was one of those books. The melody often played by the prostitutes was written on the sheet music.Pyo-wol fell in love with the score as if it was fate.He was deeply engrossed with the book, as if he was desperately trying to fill the gap in his knowledge.Pyo-wol was an angler.He was hungry for everything he had never done before.He greedily sought out knowledge and female bodies.The morals and views of the world had no effect on him.What he needed was to satisfy his immediate hunger.Tak!Finally, Pyo-wol closed the booklet.Finished reading.A faint anticipation appeared on Cho Hyang\u2019s face. Since Pyo-wol had finished reading all the books, it was now her turn.But her wish did not come true.Pit!With a gentle sound, Cho Hyang\u2019s eyes suddenly lost focus.Pyo-wol frowned and carefully embraced and laid the soft female body of Cho Hyang, which had fallen to the side.At that moment, an old Taoist appeared in the room. He was an old Taoist with a bright red face and a bright smile like a child.The old Taoist looked around the room with a curious expression.\u201cIt\u2019s a room with the right flavor. How can you live in a place like this all day?\u201cIt would be better than living in the mountains with nothing but grass.\u201d\u201cFuhaha! That\u2019s true for you, but for some, life which is like a paradise will look infinitely boring. By the way, do you know who I am?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cBut how come you\u2019re so calm?\u201d\u201cIf I felt a little bit of hostility, I would have definitely reacted first.\u201d\u201cYou are such a crazy child. It is understandable to some extent why Mu Jeong-jin failed.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re from the Qingcheng sect too.\u201d\u201cNodo is said to be a dead leaf. It is not a private residence for Mujeong.\u201d (\u201c\ub178\ub3c4\ub294 \uace0\uc5fd\uc774\ub77c\uace0 \ud55c\ub2e4. \ubb34\uc815\uc5d0\uac90 \uc0ac\uc219\uc774 \ub418\uc9c0.\u201d)\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019re here to take revenge, what is your purpose?\u201dPyo-wol asked indifferently without a single expression of surprise. Go Yeopjin couldn\u2019t help but admire the attitude of Pyo-wol.Go Yeopjin was a master of the Qingcheng sect with the highest position.\u00a0To the outsiders, Mu Jeong-jin was regarded as the best swordsman in the Qingcheng sect, but in reality, it was actually Go Yeopjin who held the title as\u00a0 the best swordsman in the Qingcheng sect.\u00a0It\u2019s just that he hid a long time ago and is not well known.Although his name is not widely known, people often freeze when standing in front of him just because he is the longest-running member of the Qingcheng sect.Go Yeopjin was the spiritual or emotional pillar of the Qingcheng sect.Even with such an existence in front of him, Pyo-wol did not waver at all.\u201cBecause of you, the Qingcheng sect has been ruined. Do you know that?\u201d\u201cShould I?\u201dPyo-wol questioned back.At that moment, Go Yeopjin was speechless. No one had ever spoken to him like this before, and no one had ever responded properly. It was such an unfamiliar experience that it felt rather fresh.\u201cStill, they became a mess because of you, shouldn\u2019t you be aware of it?\u201d\u201cHow is that my fault?\u201d\u201cAre you going to deny what you have done?\u201d\u201cNo. I have no intention of denying what I did. However, it was self-inflicted that the Qingcheng sect was humiliated and had a bad atmosphere. It\u2019s not my fault that Mu Jeong-jin learned magic.\u201d\u201cHuu\u2026!\u201dGo Yeopjin let out a sigh.A sad expression was revealed on his face. If Mu Jeong-jin had been defeated in a fair fight with Pyo-wol, the sect would have enough justification to try and challenge him again. Even if the world scolded them for being cowardly, they were confident enough to handle it.\u00a0The problem is that it has been revealed that Mu Jeong-jin has learned magic.In addition, the elder of the Qingcheng sect, a prestigious sect in Jianghu, mastered magic and ran wild. Of course, the reputation of the Qingcheng sect would plummet, and even the smallest justification to punish Pyo-wol was lost.Rather than seeking revenge, he came to a point where he had to worry about the survival of the Qingcheng sect.It was all because of Pyo-wol.In a way, the Qingcheng sect was the victim.Through the execution of the Emei sect\u2019s assassination contract, they lost Woo Gunsang who would lead Qingcheng sect, and suffered a fatal blow to their prestige.\u201cVirtue is lost due to the lust for honor2, and knowledge is beyond contention.3\u201cIt was said that virtue is swept away by lust for honor, and wisdom is created by fighting.The virtues of the Qingcheng sect were swept away by the desire of Mu Jeong-jin, and Pyo-wol has gained wisdom as he fights over and over again.Even before coming here, Go Yeopjin thought that Pyo-wol was simply a natural fighter. But the moment he saw Pyo-wol\u2019s eyes, he changed his mind.Pyo-wol was not simply a warrior with strong martial arts.His eyes were so deep that he couldn\u2019t understand what was inside.It may have been that way from the beginning, but as he continued to fight, it was clear that he had acquired a stronger intellect than any other.Go Yeopjin sighed softly.\u201cHuu! My original intention is actually to kill you and restore the honor of the Qingcheng sect.\u201dHope you enjoy the chapter~Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 98": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 98Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Qingcheng sect was in a dilemma.They were afraid of Jianghu\u2019s criticism if they were to seek revenge, and they were also afraid of Jianghu\u2019s ridicule if they left Pyo-wol alone.It was difficult for them to send a large force because they had already suffered so much damage. Plus, there is no guarantee that they would be able to deal with Pyo-wol.As shown in previous fights, Pyo-wol did not consider it a shame to run away.Pyo-wol\u2019s fighting style, in which he would run away when the situation was unfavorable to him, and reversed the unfavorable war situation through sneak attack, was the opposite of that of the Qingcheng sect.Due to this situation, it was impossible to even dream of moving in with the warriors of the Qingcheng sect. In the end, Go Yeopjin came forward.Until he came here, Go Yeopjin only thought of Pyo-wol as an unforgivable man. So he tried to cut him off in one go.However, Pyo-wol, whom he finally saw in person, was not such an easy opponent. While he had a strange atmosphere around him, he could not be regarded as simply evil.The aura coming from Pyo-Wol was somewhat sneaky and sharp. However, it wasn\u2019t evil.He neither has reason to fight, nor desire to fight.It was the first time something like this had happened, Go Yeopjin was a bit bewildered.\u201cDon\u2019t listen with your ears, but listen with your heart.\u201d1It has been an old saying in the Taoist that when you hear, you should not listen with your ears, but listen with your heart.Go Yeopjin blamed himself for moving only after hearing the complaints of the Qingcheng warriors. He should have looked at the situation with his heart and with a broader mindset.In the end, all of this happened because the Qingcheng sect did not maintain the purity of the Dao.Because he didn\u2019t listen with his heart, but with his ears, he heard nonsense that was not the truth.\u201cHoo! I\u2019m embarrassed. I showed my ugly side.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cThe reason why the Qingcheng sect became like this is also the will of Heaven, so please forgive me for trying to blame you. But I\u2019m also a human being, so I can\u2019t help but feel resentment against you. But just give me this one thing. Please refrain from killing for no reason in the future. Then the Qingcheng sect won\u2019t stand in your way.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t make such a promise.\u201d\u201cThe Qingcheng sect and I have conceded this much, and yet you\u2019re saying you can\u2019t make such a promise?\u201d\u201cThere is a reason for a person to kill another person, but I have seen many people who kill people without any reason at all. The place where I have lived in Jianghu, is not a place like the Qingcheng sect, nor is it the kind of place where people are broad-minded enough to forgive and forget. Sometimes you\u2019ll have to kill people for no reason. That\u2019s the kind of place I lived in. So if you can\u2019t understand me, you can go ahead and try to kill me.\u201d\u201cHoo\u2026!\u201dAt Pyo-wol\u2019s resolute words, Go Yeopjin gently closed his eyes.Thousands of thoughts flooded in like a tidal wave in an instant.Would it be better to stand down like this?Would it be better to deal with Pyo-wol right now, no matter what sacrifices it takes?Numerous other thoughts filled his head.\u2018Why did the heavens send such a person down here?\u2019He suddenly had a thought.\u00a0Go Yeopjin looked at Pyo-wol with his eyes closed. He tried to see Pyo-wol with his heart, and not with his eyes. Then I felt something strong.As hard as rock, as dark as pitch black, and as strong as a thunderbolt.Three energies that did not seem to go together at all were combined to form a figure called Pyo-wol.Go Yeopjin thought that what he was seeing was the essence of Pyo-wol.No wickedness was seen anywhere in Pyo-wol\u2019s nature.He knew all too well that dark does not equate to evil, and that light is not always so righteous.\u2018Just as there is no useless thing, there must have been a place where he is needed, so the sky must have sent him. Okay. Let\u2019s just stop here.\u2019Go Yeopjin opened his eyes.For a moment, his eyes deepened.\u201cThis old man was very nosy. I apologize!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dI just want to tell you one thing. Heaven has the attribute to maintain balance. It\u2019s the same in Sichuan. However, since the two major factions of Sichuan Province, the Qingcheng and Emei sect, stopped their activities at the same time, others will try to take their place. If those who seek justice take their place, peace will be maintained. But if those who seek injustice take their place, a great disaster will occur not only in Sichuan but also in the whole world. If you have any sense of compassion, please prevent such a situation from happening.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt your good time. If we meet again, see you then.\u201dThe old man got up from his seat.He disappeared as suddenly as he appeared.Pyo-wol looked at the spot where the old man had disappeared.\u201cEuhmm!\u201dIt was then that Cho Hyang regained consciousness. Cho Hyang, who had been looking around for a moment, muttered blankly.\u201cOh my! How did this happen? This is a big deal. To think I dozed off during the day.\u201dShe thought it was because she had just fallen asleep, but never imagined that someone else had visited. Pyo-wol reached out and wrapped his hand around Cho Hyang\u2019s waist.\u201cAh!\u201dWhen Pyo-wol touched her, Cho Hyang let out a moan without knowing it. Her body was now perfectly tamed by Pyo-wol. Pyo-wol placed his lips to the white nape of Cho Hyang and thought.\u2018I don\u2019t have anything such as a compassionate heart.\u2019Cho Hyang\u2019s body trembled at his deep breath.* * *\u201cHu\u2026!\u201dTang Sochu sighed and wiped the sweat from his forehead with his sleeve. His whole body was soaked with sweat from the long work.Since he was working near a furnace that always spews out intense flames, there was never a moment when he was not sweating. At first, it was hard to breathe because of the heat, but now he\u2019s pretty used to it.Even though his whole body is drenched with sweat, the fact that he can do what he loves to his heart\u2019s content made him forget even the fatigue.Tang Sochu suddenly looked back. Then he saw a boy squatting in the corner of the studio and looking at him.It was the boy who suddenly came to visit him a few days ago.There was still a distance between the two. Still, it was a lot closer than the first time.The boy\u2019s condition improved unlike in the beginning. His bones are still visible through his skin, but now his weight has increased to some extent.It was thanks to Tang Sochu who gave him food.They haven\u2019t talked to each other yet, but the distance didn\u2019t feel as far away as it used to be.Tang Sochu said to the boy.\u201cLet\u2019s go get dinner. Since I bought chicken, we\u2019ll be able to eat dinner until we have a full stomach.\u201dTang Sochu made a big decision and bought chicken. Although the meat was tough, it would still be enough for two people. The boy reacted for the first time to the word.\u201cChicken?\u201d\u201cYeah, chicken! Do you know how to eat?\u201dThe boy nodded.Tang Sochu headed to the kitchen. In the kitchen, there was already prepared chicken. Tang Sochu skillfully dismantled the chicken and began to cook it.It\u2019s been a long time since he started living alone, so he was able to cook just about anything skillfully.The sweet smell of fire permeated the kitchen. The chicken stir-fry dish was completed in no time. It was full of spices and very spicy.Tang Sochu served fried chicken and rice together.\u201cLet\u2019s eat!\u201dAt the words of Tang Sochu, the boy approached and sat down as if possessed by something.After sniffing for a moment, the boy began to eat in haste. Tang Sochu looked at the boy and then began to play with his chopsticks.The boy ate the food made by Tang Sochu as if he was possessed.In an instant, the bowl was bottomed out.A smile appeared on the corner of Tang Sochu\u2019s lips. Although he didn\u2019t eat much because of the boy, he was still quite satisfied.The strange cohabitation with a boy whose name he did not know has been going on for several days already. During that time, Tang Sochu did not ask about the boy\u2019s personal history, nor did the boy talk about himself.\u201cWow!\u201dSuddenly the boy recalled and vomitted everything he had ever eaten. The chicken, which had been so deliciously eaten, had turned thick and wet the floor.\u201cAre you okay?\u201dTang Sochu\u00a0 patted the boy on the back and asked. The boy wiped his lips with his sleeve and shook his head. The boy\u2019s complexion was very pale.\u201cAre you sick? Do you want to go to the doctor?\u201dThe boy shook his head without saying a word. Tang Sochu looked at the boy with a worried expression.What a weird kid.One day, he suddenly appeared and sat down in his studio. Judging from the way he was, it was clear that he was being chased by someone. After sneaking into the workshop, the boy never went out. It\u2019s like being afraid of someone.\u201cHu\u2026! I don\u2019t know if it was a good thing to bring you inside.\u201dTang Sochu let out a sigh.The reason he didn\u2019t expel the boy was because his past was projected in the boy. He wasn\u2019t chased like a boy, but he lived his life under the scrutiny of other people. For that reason, he had to live with the vision of the Tang Family, while hiding his achievements and skills.If he had not met Pyo-wol, his life would still be difficult. Perhaps he would live being pursued by those who coveted the vision or philosophy of his family.Therefore, the boy who suddenly hid in his workshop one day did not feel like a stranger.Tang Sochu said as he cleared the traces the boy had laid on the floor.\u201cAre you still hungry? Do you want make me to make something else?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d\u201cReally? But you threw up.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay!\u201dThe boy shook his head.Tang Sochu made a puzzled expression.The first day he came here, the boy was horribly thin. He was skin and bones to the point that he could not be considered alive.So he paid special attention to the food the boy ate.Given the special attention Tang Sochu paid, the boy ate food and recovered his stamina steadily. However, from a certain moment on, he seemed to be refusing food little by little.It wasn\u2019t that the boy didn\u2019t eat it on purpose, it was as if his body wasn\u2019t accepting it as it is now.He had been waiting for a boy to open up on his own. But he couldn\u2019t wait any longer. It was time to talk to him and discuss where he was going.Tang Sochu asked cautiously.\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cNam\u2026 Shin\u2026 Woo.\u201dThe boy said his name after trying to remember for a long time.\u201cNam Shin-woo? That\u2019s a good name. Where are you from?\u201d\u201cHe\u2026 fei.\u201d\u201cIf you are from Hefei, isn\u2019t that in Anhui Province? How did you get here from there? The distance must be over a thousand li.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201dNam Shin-woo shook his head.\u201cAre you being chased by anyone? Where did you escape from?\u201d\u201cPeople in black clothes.\u201d\u201cHuh? People wearing black clothes? Tell me more.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201dNam Shin-woo shook his head once more. He frowned a lot trying to remember, but his head was hazy as if there was fog.\u201cUgh!\u201dNam Shin-woo let out a groan as if he was suffering. It was unusual to see him have his eyes closed and his body shaking like a person with epilepsy.\u201cIt\u2019s okay! You don\u2019t have to force yourself to remember.\u201dTang Sochu hastily hugged the boy and calmed him down.\u2018Cold.\u2019The boy\u2019s body temperature was so low that it felt as if he was holding an ice cube in his arms.The little boy regained some stability as he hugged him. However, the body temperature did not return to its original state easily.\u201cWait a minute. I\u2019ll bring you a blanket.\u201dTang Sochu got up after rubbing the boy\u2019s shoulder.When he was about to walk towards the chair where he had put the blanket on.Bang!Suddenly, the ceiling of the workshop was smashed and someone broke in.\u201cFound you.\u201dThe man who broke in showed his yellow teeth and grinned.\u201cWho are you?\u201dTang Sochu shouted in surprise, but the man ignored him.\u201cI didn\u2019t know that you were hiding here. I spent so much time looking in the wrong place.\u201dThe man who grumbled and revealed his life was Cho Samcheok, the youngest member of the Seven Stars.Cho Samcheok approached Nam Shin-woo in one stride.\u201cStop!\u201dTang Sochu tried to stop Cho Samcheok in a hurry.\u201cAnnoying\u2026\u201dCho Samcheok swung his thick arms towards Tang Sochu as if chasing away flies.Puck!Tang Sochu couldn\u2019t even scream. He just flew and fell down.Seeing this, Nam Shin-woo\u2019s eyes lit up with anger.\u201cAHHHH!\u201dNam Shin-woo screamed and ran towards Cho Samcheok.\u201cWhat?\u201dCho Samcheok unconsciously swung his sword towards Nam Shin-woo, who was rushing like a wild beast.Sugioc!His way precisely cut through Nam Shin-woo\u2019s chest.The feeling of the sword cutting through the muscles and bones came vividly to his hand.Nam Shin-woo\u2019s chest was split long, revealing his bare flesh and empty breastbone, and blood was pouring out of the wound like a waterfall.It was a fatal wound that could not be saved even if a physician came.\u201cAh! I told you to be capture him alive\u2014\u201dCho Samcheok scratched his head.The request they received was to unconditionally bring back the target. However, since he inadvertently killed the target, they would not have been paid.\u201cWell, if we bring back the corpse, we will still get half the price.\u201dCho Samcheok wrinkled his nose and walked towards Nam Shin-woo\u2019s body.Then the unbelievable happened.\u201cHwuck!\u201dNam Shin-woo, who he thought was dead, woke up with a bizarre breathing sound.\u201cWhat?\u201dHope you enjoy the chapter~Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 99": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reaper of the Drifting MoonCH 99Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayNam Shin-woo\u2019s condition was bizarre.The blood that had been pouring from the deep wounds in his chest had stopped, and his eyes had lost its focus. The way he stood up limply seemed unusual for some reason.\u201cWhat? You bastard! How are you alive?\u201dCho Samcheok\u2019s eyebrows rose toward the sky.No matter how good a person was in martial arts, it was normal for them to stop moving at this level of serious injury. However, even though Nam Shin-woo was limping, he was still moving on his own two feet.\u201cThis bastard! I don\u2019t know what happened, but doesn\u2019t this mean you\u2019re still alive?\u201dA beam of light poured out of Cho Samcheok\u2019s eyes.He thought it was better this way.Their target might be in a bizarre state, but if he\u2019s already alive like this, they\u2019ll definitely get a fair price.\u00a0For the past few days, the Seven Stars has scoured the city to find Nam Shin-woo. Cho Samcheok was the first to find the clue on his whereabouts. If only Nam Shin-woo was caught, it was clear that he would be greatly recognized for his work at the Seven Stars.\u201cHeh heh!\u201dCho Samcheok approached Nam Shin-woo with a laugh.Nam Shin-woo was still limping.He thought his target wouldn\u2019t be too difficult to catch.\u201cCome here!\u201dCho Samcheok grabbed Nam Shin-woo\u2019s hair with his large hand.\u00a0Cho Samcheok was too strong for Nam Shin-woo, who was still young and fragile. Knowing that fact, Cho Samcheok was able to grab Nam Shin-woo\u2019s hair and drag him away.Puck!At that moment, Nam Shin-woo delivered an unexpected blow. His fist slammed into Cho Samcheok\u2019s side.\u201cKeuk!\u201dCho Samcheok\u2019s eyes widened at the intense pain penetrating his lungs.As far as he knows, Nam Shin-woo didn\u2019t learn anything about martial arts. But he just received a powerful shock.Cho Samcheok clenched his teeth and kicked Nam Shin-woo. Nam Shin-woo bounced away like a ball.\u201cWhat is this? You punk!\u201dCho Samcheok smirked and approached Nam Shin-woo.At that moment, Nam Shin-woo got up again. Now his eyes were completely out of focus. But what was even more surprising was the wound in his chest.The chest that had been cut long by Cho Samcheok had already been noticeably healed.It was a sight that would never have happened to a normal person. It was impossible for even a person who had mastered magic to heal a wound like that at once.It was only then that Cho Samcheok realized that the request the Seven Stars received was unusual.\u201cSo this is why they paid such a high price for the commission.\u201dCho Samcheok slightly frowned.He was concerned about Nam Shin-woo\u2019s bizarre appearance and resilience, but he wasn\u2019t particularly scared.Cho Samcheok was a master of traditional martial arts.\u00a0The Mad Sword1\u00a0he learned had the power to crush any expert into beef jerky. There was no reason for him to fear beings who had mastered bizarre magic.\u201cIf you continue to rebel, I willcut off all your limbs. It\u2019ll be interesting to see if you can still survive it. Heh heh!\u201dA great deal of aura was raised.Sensing the murder intent, Nam Shin-woo slowly took a step back. Even when he lost his reason, he recognized the strength of his opponent.At that moment, someone hugged Cho Samcheok from behind.It was Tang Sochu.\u201cRun away!\u201dTang Sochu shouted loudly while hugging Cho Samcheok.Even though he lost his sense of reason, Nam Shin-woo responded to Tang Sochu\u2019s voice. He seemed to falter for a moment, before turning around and running out of the workshop.\u201cWhat? You bastard!\u201dCho Samcheok aggressively shook his body to shake off Tang Sochu that held on to him tightly. But Tang Sochu persisted.\u201cLet go, bastard!\u201dIn the end, Cho Samcheok angrily raised his energy and dropped Tang Sochu. However, Nam Shin-woo disappeared and was nowhere to be seen.\u201cYou son of a\u2026\u201dCho Samcheok, whose anger raised to the point of his head, kicked Tang Sochu with all his might.Boom!With the sound of a drum hitting, Tang Sochu was smashed against the wall of the workshop.Tang Sochu drooped without even moving. However, Cho Samcheok flew in the direction where Nam Shin-woo disappeared without looking at him.Even after Nam Shin-woo and Cho Sam-cheok disappeared, Tang Sochu did not move for a long time.It had been almost half an hour before he moved.\u201cKerhyuk!\u201dTang Sochu let out a rough breath and raised his upper body.He was at the brink of death but he miraculously survived. Because of that, his head was blank and he couldn\u2019t remember what had happened.It was a long time later when his memory returned.\u201cShin\u2026woo?\u201dHe looked around, but Nam Shin-woo and Cho Samcheok were nowhere to be seen.\u201cKeuk!\u201dTang Sochu stood up.He felt an excruciating pain all over his body, as if he had been beaten with a large hammer. For that reason, even a simple movement as he raised his body made him feel tremendous pain.Tang Sochu, who barely got up, looked around the studio.The workshop filled with his lifelong wishes was horribly broken. It wasn\u2019t a problem that the workshop was broken. Since he can still fix it.The problem was Nam Shin-woo.He was a strange child.He doesn\u2019t know why Cho Samcheok is chasing the child, but it was clear that the child would not be in good shape if he had been captured like this.However, he couldn\u2019t help himself. Even if he clenched his teeth to endure it, he will get the same thing. He luckily survived this time, but the next time he gets hit, he is sure he will die.After thinking\u00a0 for a moment, Tang Sochu walked away.* * * patreon.com/soundlesswind21 * * *\u201cTry wearing this.\u201dCho Hyang shyly held out his clothing. What she handed over was a red long cloth made of the finest silk. The red cloth, which fit perfectly on Pyo-wol\u2019s body, was nothing more than a work of art in itself.Pyo-wol stroking the long sleeves and said,\u201cIt feels good.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad. The best craftsmen in Chengdu put great effort into making this finest silk. It suits you well.\u201dCho Hyang smiled broadly.It cost her lot of money to order the red clothing, but it was worth the money as it made Pyo-wol\u2019s appearance stand out even more.\u201cWear it well.\u201dCho Hyang hugged Pyowol\u2019s waist and said,\u201cEvery time you wear this dress, please think of me.\u201d\u201cI will.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dTears welled up in the corners of her eyes.The past few days with Pyo-wol were the happiest moments of her life. After becoming a prostitute, she had never been so sincere to anyone. In a way, Pyo-wol was like her first love.But she knew.That she can\u2019t stay like this with him forever.Happy dreams don\u2019t last forever.It was now time for her to wake up.So, she prepared the red clothing with all her heart. Hoping that Pyo-wol will remember her forever.Pyo-wol wiped away her tears. She bashfully laughed.\u201cAs expected, you\u2019re too cool.\u201dAt that moment, Hong Yushin\u2019s voice was heard outside.\u201cCan I come in? It\u2019s urgent.\u201d\u201cGo ahead.\u201dAs soon as Pyo-wol answered, Hong Yushin opened the door and entered. Hong Yu-shin glanced at Cho Hyang.\u201cYou, go out.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dCho Hyang bowed her head and went out.Pyo-wol looked at Hong Yu-shin.\u201cYou seem to have found something?\u201d\u201cThe Seven Stars is currently looking for a child.\u201d\u201cChild?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re now going around asking questions, searching for a sixteen-year-old boy. Since they deliberately asked people other than the Hao clan, it became difficult for us to find out.\u201d\u201cChild?\u201d\u201cYes! He asked a skinny kid who\u2019s around sixteen years old.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cWe haven\u2019t figured it out yet.\u201dHong Yushin avoided Pyo-wol\u2019s gaze.Since they only obtained this much information even after mobilizing all Hao clan members, he was ashamed to see Pyo-wol.Pyo-wol did not blame Hong Yushin.It was Hong Yushin, who only believed in his own intuition and moved the Hao clan members. Even if he couldn\u2019t thank him, he didn\u2019t blame him either.\u201cLet go of me!\u201dThey suddenly heard a loud noise outside.Hong Yushin frowned and said,\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cRight now, a man named Tang Sochu is trying to force himself to enter the Plum Room.\u201d\u201cTang Sochu?\u201dAt that moment, Pyo-wol opened the door and went outside.\u201cBrother!\u201dSurrounded by the guards of the Water Lily Pavilion, Tang Sochu knelt at the sight of Pyo-wol. Pyo-wol hurriedly approached him. The warriors who surrounded Tang Sochu retreated at a distance.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cHelp me.\u201dTang Sochu grabbed the hem of Pyo-wol\u2019s clothing and made eye contact. Pyo-wol nodded his head after looking at Tang Sochu\u2019s red and bloodshot eyes.\u201cSay it.\u201d\u201cWill you help me?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s something I can do.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a kid who ran away from my workshop.\u201dTang Sochu briefly explained his experience with Nam Shin-woo.\u201cSo, you mean that a large warrior with a sword broke down your workshop and tried to kidnap a child you were protecting?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201dPyo-wol\u2019s gaze turned to Hong Yushin.\u201cIt seems that it\u2019s the youngest of the Seven Stars, Cho Samcheok or the Mad Blood-Spraying Swordsman. The appearance and characteristics he told me are consistent with him.\u201d\u201cCho Samcheok?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve probably seen him yourself. He uses a sword as big as his own size as a weapon. He has a fire-like personality, but he has a surprisingly cold side. Even after getting caught by him, he survived, so luck was on your younger brother.\u201dThe reason Tang Sochu survived was because his body was naturally trained while handling iron. If any other person had been hit by Cho Samcheok like that, they would have already died.Tang Sochu knelt down on one knee.It was because his remaining stamina was exhausted. His mind went numb. But Tang Sochu struggled to regain his composure and said,\u201cThere\u2019s something strange. The child, obviously, was cut deep in his chest by the sword of Cho Samcheok. I thought he was dead because he was so severely injured that his bones were exposed, but he floundered and came back to life. It was a strange sight. It\u2019s really\u2026\u201dTang Sochu\u2019s voice gradually dwindled.He soon lost consciousness.Pyo-wol carefully hugged Tang Sochu and laid him down. Fortunately, he only fainted, and it seemed that his life was not in danger.Hong Yushin mumbled as he gave the order.\u201cHe was wounded enough to expose the bones of his chest, but he was said to have survived? Maybe it was related to the Ghost King?\u201d2\u201cGhost King?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know about the Ghost King?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dPyo-wol answered honestly.Hong Yushin frowned for a moment, but soon explained about the Ghost King.\u201cA few decades ago, a mysterious monster appeared. He immediately caught the attention of people as soon as he appeared in Jianghu. Do you know why?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because no matter how badly injured he was, he did not die. He did not shrink\u00a0 even when he was staying in a place where no ordinary person could ever live. No expert could kill him.\u201dNo matter what serious injuries he suffered, the Ghost King did not die. Given a little time, he would recover back to normal.The Ghost King was held as the most incomprehensible being in Jianghu.Nothing was known about him.Where he came from.How he got his ability.The true history of his situation.What his intentions were.None of those were clear.At some point, such rumors began to circulate in Jianghu. Those who find out the secret of the Ghost King will enjoy eternal life. Thousands of warriors set out to capture the Ghost King. But no one got what they wanted.The king was strong.He was strong enough to be horrifying.He possessed such a powerful force that the top-ranked martial artists could not do anything about him. In fact, there was a middle-class clan who went out to catch him and they were annihilated without leaving a single trace.Since then, the Ghost King has become a legend.There were still many people who wanted him, but no one dared to touch him.The demon king was like a divine dragon in a cloud.There are only rumors that he wanders around in Jianghu, but there are only a handful of people who have met him in person.The Ghost King was also the subject of attention in the Hao clan. However, because he was so elusive, they were not able to even grasp his whereabouts.After hearing all the stories, Pyo-wol muttered,\u201cSo, it means that a person with the same constitution as that Ghost King has appeared.\u201dIt was understandable that the Seven Stars was chasing the boy.It was clear that the one who secured the boy would be one step closer to the secret of the Ghost King.In that case, immortality would no longer be just a dream.Hope you enjoy the chapter~Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After all, he dreamed of living once, the pinnacle of Jianghu.However, contrary to his ambition, reality was harsh.In Jianghu, the Two Factions, Three Clans, Three Packs, and Three Villages were firmly established, and the Three Saints were walking around.There was no place for the Seven Stars to intervene.Although they managed to establish themselves in Hunan and gain fame, the limitations of the Seven Stars were clear.Each member of the Seven Stars was clearly a master, but they did not reach the level where they could command Jianghu.Although Sa Hyo-kyung possessed the force that overwhelms the other six, he was not unique enough like the Three Saints.He did not possess great leadership, nor did he have strong financial power.Due to such limitations, the Seven Stars, despite its fame, was unable to rally enough forces. So they had no choice but to become a small elite group.Sa Hyo-kyung was always dissatisfied with that. But since reality was cruel, he had no choice but to wait patiently for an opportunity.\u00a0And a great opportunity came.If they can catch Nam Shin-woo and take him to their client, they can receive enormous financial benefits through tangible and intangible support.It was the opportunity that Sa Hyo-kyung had longed for. So they had to catch Nam Shin-woo.\u201cDrive him to the slums in the north. If you miss him this time, everyone will die at my hands.\u201dSa Hyo-kyung opened his eyes as he gave orders to his younger brothers.\u201cHe\u2019s already hurt. He won\u2019t be able to go far.\u201dAs Cho Samcheok spoke in high spirits, Sa Hyo-kyung\u2019s face was wrinkled like a piece of paper.\u201cYou mean you still missed him while he was hurt?\u201d\u201cWho knew that blacksmith could bite so hard? Hmp!\u201d\u201cBlacksmith?\u201d\u201cYeah! That little bastard was hiding in a workshop.\u201d\u201cReally? Why is the little guy hiding in a studio?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a coincidence, right? We don\u2019t have to worry how he got there.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure you finished it well so that there won\u2019t be a problem, right?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. There will be no problem.\u201dAlthough Cho Samcheok\u2019s answer was unreliable, Sa Hyo-kyung didn\u2019t care anymore.Now was the time to focus on catching Nam Shin-woo.Even though he was seriously injured, Nam Shin-Woo was avoiding the chase of the Seven Stars like a mouse.\u2018Tsk! Had I been able to get help from the Hao clan, I would have caught him right away.\u2019Sa Hyo-kyung clicked his tongue.If it had been in Hunan, the courtyard of the Seven Stars, he would have done the work without paying attention to this or that. There, he had the confidence to solve any kind of problem.\u00a0But this place was Sichuan.They had no connection here, so even if there was a problem, there was no one who could help them fix it.Sichuan has been recognized as a place with the highest vigilance against outsiders. In fact, there was no room for outsiders to enter because it had its own system.Because of that, the Seven Stars felt a huge burden as they continued to stay here for a long time.\u2018I have to catch the target and get out of here, I don\u2019t know what kind of dung fly will come and sniff us if we stay here too long.\u2019However, as expected, Nam Shin-woo was not easily caught.Nam Shin-woo avoided the pursuit of the Seven Stars with his almost beast-like instinct. The Seven Stars was having a hard time because he exhibited a sense of almost foreknowledge and exquisitely used the maze-like structure of the slums.Yo Sulyeong brushed her messy hair up and muttered,\u201cOh, I\u2019m so annoyed! What is this? I\u2019m out of shape\u2026\u201dHer clothes were stained here and there in pursuit of Nam Shin-woo, and there were beads of sweat on her forehead. What bothered her the most was the stench peculiar to the slum.Yo Sulyeong\u2019s eyes were filled with killing intent.\u201cYou rat! Don\u2019t you dare get caught. Because this sister won\u2019t let you go.\u201dShe raised her internal energy and expanded her senses.Her current location was in a slum on the outskirts of Chengdu. Due to the unique ant cave-like structure of the slum, it was difficult to detect Nam Shin-woo in a normal way.It was also impossible to ask for cooperation from those living in the slums.\u201cIt\u2019s because people who live in poverty have a strong sense of vigilance.\u201dYo Sulyeong\u2019s spirit became stronger.But when her senses were spread out, too many movements were caught, making it only as a hindrance.\u201cAh! So annoying!\u201dIt was when Yo Sulyeong started to walk while grumbling.Suddenly, several men stood in front of her.They had dirty faces and horrible smells because they haven\u2019t washed their clothes for several days. They were the men living in the slums.\u201cHehehe!\u201d\u201cWhat brings such a pretty lady to such a shabby place?\u201cWhy? Are you doing this to comfort the poor?\u201dThe men\u2019s eyes looking at Yo Sulyeong were full of desire. Yo Sulyeong knew very well what those eyes meant.\u201cMy little girl is like this, so everything like star dust is twisted. Since this older sister is now Barb, it would be better to turn it off.\u201d (\u201c\ub0b4 \uaf2c\ub77c\uc9c0\uac00 \uc774\ub7ec\ub2c8 \ubcc4 \ubc84\ub7ec\uc9c0 \uac19\uc740 \uac83\ub4e4\uc774 \ub2e4 \uaf2c\uc774\ub124. \uc774 \ub204\ub098\uac00\uc9c0\uae08\uc740 \ubc14\ube0c\ub2c8\uae4c \uc369 \uaebc\uc9c0\ub294 \uac8c \uc88b\uc744 \uac70\uc57c.\u201d)\u201cAww! I\u2019m so scared.\u201d\u201cIs it okay to say something like that with such a pretty face? These elders should teach you a lesson.\u201dThe men in the slums talked without knowing the subject. Their eyes were obsessively scanning the voluptuous body of Yo Sulyeong.It was almost impossible to see a woman with the same beauty as Yo Sulyeong in a slum. This is because some people do not even dare approach the slums at all.If it had been somewhere other than the slums, the men would not have even been able to even approach Yo Sulyeong.\u00a0But this was a slum.Even if a woman goes missing, no one would know.Although Yo Sulyeong\u2019s arrogant attitude bothered them, the men who were already blinded by desire did not have time to think deeply about this or that.They\u2019re already at their lowest point of their life anyway, so there\u2019s nothing for them to be afraid of.\u201cHehehe!\u201d\u201cPretty Miss. Please do us a favor.\u201d\u201cYou look very soft. If you swallow it in one go, it won\u2019t smell fishy.\u201dThe men approached Yo Sulyeong while talking dirty.\u00a0Yo Sulyeong made a surprised expression. She really didn\u2019t know that she would be treated like this in this distant location such as Sichuan.Her face flushed red. Her appearance made men\u2019s bodies even hotter.\u201cHeh heh! It\u2019s already getting hot.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m already hard.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s burn it up even more.\u201dThe men\u2019s words ignited.\u201cLet\u2019s burn it up? Alright! I\u2019ll burn everyone.\u201dA beam of light exploded from Yo Sulyeong\u2019s eyes.For a moment, the men flinched.It was then that they realized that Yo Sulyeong was no ordinary person. There was no way that an ordinary woman would enter the slum alone without fear.\u00a0But they realize it too late.Cwaeeac!When Yo Sulyeong swung her hand, a red airsteam rose and attacked the men. The red airstream turned into flames when it touched the men\u2019s bodies.Whack!\u201cKerhyuk!\u201d\u201cSa, save me!\u201dThe men rolled around on the floor frantically trying to extinguish the fire. However, the fire on their bodies was not natural, but the fire of hell created by Yo Sulyeong.Once attached to the body, it will never stop burning until everything is all burnt.Without knowing this, the men rolled around to put out the fire. The nearby houses were also soon set on fire. The wooden house quickly burned, and the flames quickly spread throughout the slum.\u201cHo-ho!\u201dSeeing the scene, Yo Sulyeong burst out in giggles.The scene in front of her was the reason she was given the terrible nickname of Bloody Witch. The witch who loved and controlled blood and fire was Yo Sulyeong.The flames she created spread, burning the entire slum.\u201cYou rat! If you don\u2019t want to burn to death, you\u2019d also better jump out of the way. Hohoho!\u201dYo Sulyeong looked at the fast-spreading fire and smiled eerily.\u201cFire!\u201d\u201cArgh! H, help me!\u201d\u201cOh no, my house is on fire\u2026!\u201dThe poor were stunned by the flames that quickly engulfed the streets.The fire was so strong and it spread so quickly that it was impossible to put it out. There were a few buckets of water but even if they poured them on the fire, it wouldn\u2019t be extinguished.The wrath caused by the desires of some men was immense. They had already vanished into ashes, but the devastation they brought engulfed the entire slum.\u201cOh my god!\u201d\u201cHow am I going to live now?\u201dSeeing the house engulfed in fire, the poor despaired. Women and children sat down on the street, weeping, and the men watched the flames in disbelief.\u201cHo-ho-ho! Come out already, kid!\u201dYo Sulyeong thought that Nam Shin-woo would come out soon. However, Nam Shin-woo was nowhere to be seen.\u201cWhat? Are you out of this place already? I don\u2019t think so.\u201dYo Sulyeong\u00a0 looked at the slum engulfed in flames with a frown on her forehead. Thousands of people were out on the street, but she couldn\u2019t even see a child similar to Nam Shin-woo.\u201cShit! Is he not here?\u201dYo Sulyeong turned around and pursed her lips.She was so calm that many would find it hard to believe that she was the person responsible for the current disaster in the slums.\u201cSister Yo!\u201dAt that time, a warrior with a sword around his waist came running calling for Yo Sulyeong.The man whose face resembles a wolf with his protruding face and nose was Jae Woong-pyeong, the fourth member of Seven Stars.\u201cFourth brother!\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m looking for that bastard.\u201d\u201cThat bastard has already left Chengdu.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe youngest is already chasing after him, so we need to join them soon.\u201d\u201cOh my! Have I just been fooling around?\u201dYo Sulyeong made an absurd expression on her face.Jae Woong-pyeong clicked his tongue when he Yo Sulyeong like that.\u201cTsk tsk! How can you make a mistake like that all the time? That\u2019s a talent, a talent I say.\u201d\u201cHo ho ho!\u201dJae Woong-pyeong frowned as he looked around the slums engulfed in flames.\u201cThen why did you set Chengdu on fire? What will you do if the sect members of Chengdu come running at this rate?\u201d\u201cHo-ho! They won\u2019t come. Because of him, they\u2019re withering away and refraining from doing any outside activities.\u201d\u201cHim?\u201d\u201cPyo-wol. Everyone would shake whenever his name was mentioned, as if they would be severely punished. This is why their reaction to the fire will also be late because everyone is busy saving themselves. So by the time they arrive, we will already be gone. Ho ho ho!\u201d\u201cHuu! Do you really believe that? The rumors must have been an exaggeration. Because of one person, all the warriors of Chengdu are wary?\u00a0 I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d\u201cThen what if you run into him?\u201d\u201cAt that time, I will cut off his head with this bloody sword. He will not even respond and will sacrifice his life for me.\u201dJae Woong-pyeong said while tapping the weapon hung around his waist.\u00a0At his arrogant words, Yo Sulyeong wrinkled the tip of her nose slightly. Although his arrogance was annoying, Jae Woong-pyeong really deserved to act like so.In terms of the destructive power of one\u2019s martial arts, Jae Woong-pyeong was among the top three in the Seven Stars.His only flaw was that he would often suffer a lot of damage due to his hasty judgments caused by his madness and irrationality. But other than that he is a pretty reliable teammate.\u201cI\u2019ll look forward to you cutting off his neck.\u201d\u201cI promise. I\u2019ll bring it to you first once I cut his throat.\u201d\u201cHo ho ho!\u201dYo Sulyeong broke into laughter.Her figure, which was dyed red because of the full-fledged fire, looked even more bewitching. A voluptuous chest, a slender waist that looked like it could only be a handful, and slim legs were enough to shake Jae Woong-pyeong\u2019s heart.Jae Woong-pyeong looked at Yo Sulyeong\u2019s whole body with eyes full of desire.Yo Sulyeong knew his gaze.Not only Jae Woong-pyeong, but all the other members of the Seven Stars looked at her with lustful eyes. Unlike a normal woman who would have found such gazes terrifying, Yo Sulyeong rather enjoyed the attention.\u201cGo!\u201dYo Sulyeong said as she passed by Jae Woong-pyeong.Her voluptuous hips swayed bewitchingly below her slender waist. At the same time, Jae Woong-pyeong\u2019s eyes fluttered left and right.Yu Sulyeong raised the corners of her lips more enchantingly at Jae Woong-pyeong\u2019s gaze behind her back.One step, two steps, she walked lightly like a butterfly.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dThen Yo Sulyeong frowned.Something was strange.By now, Jae Woong-pyeong would have rushed to her side and stuck next to her. But she didn\u2019t feel any of his movement.\u201cWhat are you doing? Why aren\u2019t you coming?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhy are you being late for? If you don\u2019t come, I\u2019ll leave you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dStill, there was no answer.Yo Sulyeong looked back nervously.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Until when are\u2026\u201dYo Sulyeong opened her eyes wide and could not speak.Under a large burning tree, Jae Woong-pyeong\u2019s figure was floating in the air and swaying from side to side. His large opened eyes were red and bloodshot, and his tongue which was protruding from his lips had turned blue.\u201cW, what?\u201dGoosebumps ran up along Yo Sulyeong\u2019s spine.A thin thread that was difficult to distinguish with the naked eye was digging into Jae Woong-pyeong\u2019s neck.\u201cFourth brother!\u201dYo Sulyeong\u2019s desperate voice echoed in the slum that was engulfed in fire.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
