The instincts of an excellent assassin told him to leave the place this moment itself.The first thought that came to his mind after waking-up was that this was a dangerous place \u2013 life and death were a hair\u2019s breadth away in a place like this.He began to rise with the support of his arm. Suddenly, he realized that his arm was too weak to support his body\u2019s weight. Bang! He fell back.He seemed to be extremely shocked. A million thoughts started to race through his mind. Where was he? What was going on? How did he end-up being here?He realized that he lay next to a soft bed. He observed his surroundings, and found that he was in a magnificently decorated room. However, the room was empty except for a set of square tables and a bed. The bed that he lay next-to was so huge that it could easily accommodate seven to eight people.[What happened? How did I get here? Wasn\u2019t I supposed to be in the middle of an intense gunfight? Or is this a part of my afterlife?] A surge of thoughts filled Jun Xie\u2019s mind as he tried to recall the last memories of his past life.*** ***Jun Xie was a killer by profession; he was an outstanding gold-ranking assassin. He had made his debut five years ago. He could penetrate into any place. He was an ace killer with a hundred per-cent success rate. None of his predecessors had been able to accomplish such a feat.He was ranked number one in the ranking list of assassins. Jun Xie or the \u2018Evil Monarch\u2019 had also risen to the first spot of the underworld\u2019s top-ranked experts. Therefore, it was natural that the bounty offered for his head was the highest. In fact, the bounty offered for his head had been the highest for the last three years.However, no one was willing to go near him since he was the top-ranked assassin; let alone killing him.Many first-rate assassins had daringly accepted the job of putting the \u2018Evil Monarch\u2019 to sleep in the past; they had obviously hoped to get the huge bounty. But, the only reward that they received was death. The \u2018Evil Monarch\u2019 couldn\u2019t be touched; let alone be hurt or assassinated.A wealthy person from Country \u2018Y\u2019 had once offered an exorbitant reward of $100 Million for the head of the \u2018Evil Monarch\u2019. Two assassins had accepted the job. They were as infamous as the \u2018Evil Monarch\u2019, and were among the top-ranked assassins. They were found dead three days later.No one had dared to take-up the job since then; even though the reward was increased several times.It was a suicide mission. And, the money was of no good use for a dead person. So, the name \u2018Evil Monarch\u2019 had become a taboo in the underworld\u2019s bounty list.The name \u2018Evil Monarch\u2019 had become a symbol of fear for the people of underworld in every country. Many people knew about his existence, but no one knew how he looked.Jun Xie\u2019s character was true to his name. If one word had to be used to describe him\u2026 it was \u2018Evil\u2019; if two words were used, it was \u2018Bloody Evil\u2019; and if three words\u2026 it was \u2018God-damned Evil\u2019.Jun Xie had no friends; he always worked alone. He was extremely fussy while accepting his missions; not only towards his clients\u2026 but also towards his targets.He would never kill a harmless person such as a defenseless beggar; no matter how much money was paid as the reward. However, he would voluntarily step-up to assassinate a harmful person. After that, he would go on to find the concerned person\u2019s enemies, and request them for his remuneration. And, no one could say \u2018no\u2019 to him. These hapless people had no history of hiring him. In fact, some of them had never even heard of him.It was said that he had intended to kill a human trafficker once. But, he had been unable to find anyone to make the payment for the task. So, he had requested a little girl who was abducted by the human trafficker for a dime as his payment. A dime! He had a principle \u2013 he never did business without any rewards. And, there could be no exceptions to this rule.Even his master and division members \u2013 who understood him well \u2013 were often left speechless owing to his character and way of conduct.Another story was that\u2026 he had once removed toilet papers from the toilet\u2026 just before his master went to use it. So, his master had asked his aide to bring a toilet paper when he realized that it was missing. The then young Jun Xie had managed to extort $500 thousand as labor fees from his own master. He had called all of his division\u2019s sisters to the toilet\u2019s entrance. He had even invited several beauties to join-in. So, the master had to ultimately give in.Jun Xie believed that his biggest weakness was that he was an extremely loving person. This statement often made people puke since his identity had been established as that of a top-ranked assassin.However, his claim wasn\u2019t completely baseless.He detested the poor being oppressed by the rich in his home country; especially the officials using their powers against the common people. Besides, he detested seeing his own people getting oppressed in foreign countries. This \u2018patriotic\u2019 behavior of his had stirred quite a number of frightful disasters.However, the clients still craved for his services since he had exceptional skills in fist-fighting and sword-fighting. Moreover, he possessed superior marksmanship, eyesight, and immeasurable martial arts prowess. All this had contributed to his hundred per-cent success rate. His achievements were truly unprecedented.He was the only person amongst the peak-level assassins who had an unblemished record. He was indeed the ultimate assassin in the realm of assassins.Jun Xie had another weakness \u2013 he was a typical hot-headed youth.His last mission had been another \u2018volunteer\u2019 job. He had heard that the secret organization of Country \u2018M\u2019 had quietly unearthed an invaluable treasure from the Kunlun Mountains of Country \u2018Z\u2019. Then, they had smuggled this treasure to their own country before Country Z came to know about it. Being a hot- headed youth\u2026 Jun Xie had exploded into a fury.How could a national treasure be allowed to fall into the hands of foreign country in these peaceful times?Jun Xie had singlehandedly managed to massacre his way towards the treasure by employing sneak tricks, traps, and excellent combat skills. He had proudly faced nearly one-hundred secret service agents of Country M. He had killed seventy secret agents before laying his hands on the treasure. The courage of the secret service agents had been shattered to pieces by then. Jun Xie was even confident that he could waltz out of the area without incurring any harm.But then, something unexpected had happened.A supernatural incident had occurred as soon as he had touched a palm-sized heretical-looking pagoda in the treasure \u2013 his entire body had become paralyzed. He couldn\u2019t even blink; let alone move his body. He hadn\u2019t noticed the blood that had gushed out from one of his wounds into the small, delicate, and exquisite pagoda.Jun Xie\u2019s last memory comprised of looking at about fifty \u2018mini grenades\u2019 flying towards him and around twenty firearms shooting towards him. He couldn\u2019t do anything about it even though he was capable of wiping out all his enemies in one fell swoop with his strength and skills.This feeling was truly infuriating.[I had never imagined that I would fall today\u2026 in such an absurd manner. But, I\u2019ve lived a good life. I\u2019ve killed at least a thousand corrupt officials, local tyrants, and bullies. My life was worth something. I have no regrets.][Others would smile as they enter the Heavens\u2026 I smile as I enter the depths of Hell.][I\u2019ve killed countless people. But, they were scum; they deserved it. It was fair. So, why should I be fearful? I don\u2019t care even if this act drags me down to Hell.][Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Exterminate the dirty scum! End the life of every criminal! I don\u2019t care even if the world condemns me as a murderer.][Is there anyone else in this world who has lived as I did? What a delightfully unrestrained life I\u2019ve lived.]Jun Xie let out a loud laughter as these thoughts crossed his mind, \u201cHahahaha\u2026\u201d*** ***\u201cYoung Master, you\u2026 are you all right?\u201d a timid voice was heard from beside him. The voice sounded as if someone was about to cry. Then, a cold hand was placed on his forehead.[Young Master? This isn\u2019t a dream\u2026 This isn\u2019t hell either!] Jun Xie woke-up, and opened his eyes. Suddenly, he was hit by a wave of unfamiliar memories. He felt as if he was struck by lightning.Was he inside someone else\u2019s body? Had he already been reincarnated? But, how could he remember his past life so clearly? [Can it be that I didn\u2019t drink Old Lady Meng\u2019s soup (1)\u2026 or did I end-up in someone else\u2019s body?][Did I move to some other body\u2026 or is this a rebirth?]Jun Xie lay motionless, and continue to stare coldly. However, he couldn\u2019t understand what had happened.Suddenly, he laughed out loud, \u201cSon of a bi*ch! Good deeds do fetch a good reward. I had never hoped for such a good thing to happen to me; I had never expected to survive like this. It seems that my great deeds in the past life had accumulated immeasurable amounts of merits. Wahahahaha\u2026\u201dThe ten-year-old girl beside him had been stroking her hand over his forehead. She trembled in fear as she heard him shout. She then ran to hide in a corner. She stared at the \u2018Young Master\u2019 with confusion and fear in her eyes. Her face was pale; like a frightened quail.Jun Xie let out another scream; but it was a wretched one. It sounded like a girl\u2019s scream. [Can it be that a \u2018part\u2019 of me is gone? Nooooo!] Jun Xie hurriedly grabbed his crotch even though there was a little girl in front of him.He heaved a sigh of relief as he realized that no part of him was missing. [The Heaven didn\u2019t mistreat me. I can still have children.][That really scared me. I thought that I\u2019ve moved into a girl\u2019s body.] Jun Xie wiped away the cold sweat.Then, he began to inspect his new body.Stagnant Meridians, atrophied muscles, joint stiffness\u2026.[What kind of a person is this? The body is too fragile. It\u2019s such a crappy one!]Jun Xie secretly whispered, [Doesn\u2019t matter! I would only take three to seven years to be back at the top as long as the meridians haven\u2019t been destroyed\u2026]Suddenly, Jun Xie realized something \u2013 he was in a completely different world!The place didn\u2019t seem like the Earth he was familiar with. He seemed to be alone in this world. He neither knew nor understood the rules and regulations of this new world.This feeling made even a cold-blooded assassin like Jun Xie feel frustration.He observed his clothes and the furniture. He realized that they were completely different from his times\u2019. The joy of being alive began to subside as this realization dawned upon him. Instead, he started to feel confused.[It seems that I\u2019ve indeed been granted a second chance.]Jun Xie should\u2019ve been happy with this prospect. However, he was filled with a feeling of extreme loss and pain. He had never felt like this before. His nose started to turn sour, his eyes started to turn watery, and his heart became suffocated. His mouth started to become self-deprecating as he began to cry for the first time.[It\u2019s not easy to give-up on my homeland and planet. I believed in my last moments\u2026 that I could let it go. But now, I\u2019ve realized that I can\u2019t let go; I really can\u2019t!][I thought that I didn\u2019t care for anything in this world. But now\u2026 I know that I care about a lot of things. In fact, I can\u2019t even count them.][Moreover, I don\u2019t belong to this foreign land. I can\u2019t have a sense of belonging to this place.][My soul will always be an outsider\u2026]Jun Xie inclined his head to one side. A tear escaped his eye once he was sure that no one could see him.This was the first tear of a man from two worlds.Never belittle a man who cries; everyone has to endure sadness at some point in one\u2019s life.*** ***Jun Xie stared into the bronze mirror, and saw a young and childish-looking face. His face was slim with thin lips, and long eyebrows slanting upwards towards his temples. A set of fine eyes added a sharp feeling to his face. He laughed and mumbled, \u201cThe kid\u2019s got some good looks. He\u2019s rather handsome. But, he looks like a \u2018flower\u2019 boy\u2026 and his voice sounds like a sissy\u2019s.\u201dHis new body was drastically different from his last body. He recalled that his previous body was full of killing vigor. His looks hadn\u2019t been of the popular type back then. His eyes had been a bit small and thin, and his nose had been a point lower. Overall, he had average looks. But still, he had looked like a standard male. He had always looked down upon flower-boys even though he knew that there were some real men amongst them. He had never thought that he would end-up transmigrating into a flower boy\u2019s body; and that too a handsome one\u2019s!Jun Xie noticed that there was a tattoo of a pagoda on his left wrist. He stroked it, and asked in a gentle tone, \u201cAre you the one who brought me over, mate?\u201d There was a trace of pride on his face, [I managed to complete the mission. I kept this item safe\u2026 and I didn\u2019t allow it to fall into the hands of those foreigners\u2026 even though I transmigrated.]The pagoda-shaped pattern was none other than the exquisite pagoda that Jun Xie had traded his life for! He was sure that it was the same pagoda even though it had transformed into a small tattoo on his hand. He couldn\u2019t explain how he knew this. But, his heart told him that it was so. It was a real and mysterious feeling.The familiar pagoda pattern brought him a sense of comfort even though he was in a foreign land. However, he was still in a state of confusion as to what had exactly happened. He couldn\u2019t ascertain what kind of a feeling it was. But, he tried to remain calm and collected. His face didn\u2019t show any tension that went through his mind. This was one of the skills he had acquired as an ace assassin.He was still in a quiet and indifferent mood.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe was still stroking the small pagoda pattern on his hand. Suddenly, the pattern started to emit a burst of foggy yellow light. Then, it disappeared. Jun Xie started to feel lightheaded, and sensed as if something had entered his mind.\u201cStrange!\u201d Jun Xie shook his head. He was amazed. The pagoda had initially appeared as a small palm-sized tower. Then, it had transformed into a tattoo on his hand. And after that, it had disappeared. Could it be that it was actually a legendary treasure?Suddenly, a voice resounded, \u201cYoung Master, the Old Master is asking for you.\u201d Jun Xie was about to investigate what he had felt earlier in his mind when his chain of thoughts was broken by a voice.\u201cFor me? Why?\u201d Jun Xie raised his eyebrows and asked. [What qualifications does this old geezer have to command me to go meet him? Does he think that I\u2019m his grandson or something?] However, he swallowed these words since he realized that the old master may be his grandfather\u2026 or at least his present body\u2019s grandfather.The little girl looked at him with a terrified expression on her face, \u201cI don\u2019t know why he\u2019s calling you.\u201d The young girl lowered her head, and blinked in panic. One of her legs was positioned before the other. Her body was slightly tilted. She seemed ready to run away from the room.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Novel_Saga\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Novel_SagaThe sixteen-years-old Jun Mo Xie was the only descendant in the younger generation of the Jun Family of the Tian Xiang Kingdom. He was an idle and indolent person. He was a useless freeloader, a scum of society, and a super-level debauchee. He was a typical parasitic worm who had no value or reason to be kept alive.These features described the new identity that Jun Xie had taken-up after he had transmigrated into a new body.[I\u2019m Jun Xie. I was often referred to as the \u2018Evil Monarch\u2019\u2026 while you were given the name Jun Mo Xie; aren\u2019t you ashamed? No wonder your body was taken over by me. There\u2019s no injustice in this.]Jun Xie let out a deep sigh as he recalled the memories of Young Master Jun and his actions in the past. He would\u2019ve \u2018voluntarily\u2019 killed such a person in his past life if he had come across any. He could\u2019ve transmigrated into any body. So, why did it had to be this scum? Jun Xie recalled a phrase from Buddha\u2019s teachings. This phrase talked about the laws of cause and effect \u2013\u2018If a person kills too many pigs\u2026 then that person shall be reincarnated as a pig in his next life\u2019. It seemed that these words were indeed true. Jun Xie thought about all the scums that he had killed \u2014 it indeed made-up for a considerable sum.This debauchee\u2019s father was Jun Wu Hui. He was a great general, but he had fell in a battle ten years ago. His mother had passed away in depression soon after that. He had two brothers \u2013 Jun Mo You and Jun Mo Chou; they had met a heroic end in a war three years ago. His grandfather \u2013 Jun Zhan Tian \u2014 was still alive. He was a highly decorated Grand Duke, and an extremely powerful military figure of the Kingdom.He also had an uncle \u2013 Jun Wu Yi. He had become paralyzed from waist-down owing to his injuries incurred in a war ten years ago.Jun Mo Xie belonged to a great Family which was once filled with exceptional heroes. However, it was now in a sorry state. The final successor of the Family \u2013 Jun Mo Xie \u2014 had ended-up losing his body to Jun Xie. Thankfully, Jun Xie had managed to maintain his identity as a member of the Jun family. So, Jun Xie\u2019s child would become a successor of the Jun family\u2019s bloodline. It seemed to be Heaven\u2019s grace towards the Jun family.[Since this is Heaven\u2019s will\u2026 I\u2019ll consider that we\u2019re both of the \u2018Jun\u2019 descent\u2026 and face the situation for you.] Jun Xie grinned and shrugged,\u00a0[To be honest\u2026 I don\u2019t want to. To have this kind of a crappy body and shitty reputation\u2026 I can only imagine the level of suffering I\u2019ll have to face because of your body.]The original Jun Mo Xie\u2019s lingering spirit shouted with anger, \u201cYou cheap bastard! Do you think I want all this?!\u201dJun Xie opened the door, and stepped out in the sunlight. He sighed as he faced the brilliant rays of the sun, [I\u2019m not the same anymore, but at least the Sun is. Jun Mo Xie isn\u2019t Jun Xie!][But, my heart remains that of a \u2018Jun\u2019\u2026 It doesn\u2019t matter if I\u2019m in another world.]\u201cYoung Master\u2026\u201d the two maids who stood before the door bowed and greeted him.Jun Xie nodded to them. Then, he started to observe his surroundings. He shook his head as he saw four maids engaged in something nearby.Jun Xie knew that the young masters would be waited upon by attractive young beauties. However, he was surrounded by aunties. The eleven year old girl \u2013 a Lolita \u2014 was the only exception to this case. Jun Xie remembered that these maids had been arranged by his grandfather. And, these maids had one thing in common \u2013 they were excessively healthy and robust. Their muscular legs could even put a tree to shame.\u201cWhat are they doing?\u201d Jun Xie raised his head and pointed his chin towards several maids in the distance.An older maid lowered her head and replied, \u201cThey\u2019re helping the Young Master feed the birds and dogs\u2026 as well as those fighting beasts.\u201d\u201cOh!\u201d Jun Xie strolled over to the area. [This is an exotic sight to behold!] Seven to eight cages were placed above the jardini\u00e8res in an orderly manner. Each of these cages contained different colored birds which hopped around in a lively manner. A few large dogs lay on the ground with their tongues jutting out. The sound of crickets could be heard from several bamboos at a distance. It seemed from their sound that they were some rare breed with high-grade fighting skills.In addition, there was a cage containing two colorful hissing snakes. The original Young Master seemed to have a diverse range of hobbies.Jun Xie frowned in disgust, and ordered, \u201cFind someone to sell-off all these\u2026 as soon as possible. Throw away the ones which can\u2019t be sold\u2026 or just kill them for their meat. This is a human residential area\u2026 not a zoo. Placing them here would make people sick.\u201dThe eyes of all the maids \u2013 including the Lolita \u2013 bulged out in surprise, \u201cWhat?\u201d They raised their heads, and stared at their Young Master. They thought, [Has the Young Master gone mad? These are your precious treasures\u2026 that were brought at an incredibly exorbitant price. You want to sell it off today. You would probably buy it back tomorrow!]\u201cBut, don\u2019t sell off the snakes. I shall use them for soup when I return,\u201d Jun Xie ordered, and walked ahead without looking back.Everyone was left speechless.He continued to walk through a garden, several pavilions, and a drill field. He then went around a very big pond, and walked for another few minutes through a road amidst two rows of trees to reach the Old Master\u2019s residence. He discovered that his residence was located on the south, while Grandpa Jun\u2019s residence was located on the north. The distance between the two residences would measure around three kilometers.The present size of his familial clan seemed to be quite big. This should be the capital of the Kingdom if the memory of his present body had served him correct. There were only a handful of families who had a residence with an area of several tens of square meters in the capital; excluding the Imperial Palace.Grandpa Jun was seated behind his desk. His hair was shiny black even though he was well over sixty. He could be easily mistaken for someone in his forties. His majestic countenance was filled with helplessness as he watched his grandson lazily enter the room in a feeble manner. He almost lost his temper.Jun Zhan Tian was born poor. He had fought throughout the world, and had become a general in his youth. His name brought terror to the military forces of every kingdom. He possessed superior military tactics, and was endowed with a profound steadiness in character. He could maintain a calm exterior regardless of being joyous or furious. He was one of the few people in the Tian Xiang Kingdom who had the cultivation level of Sky Xuan Rank.He had proved his capabilities by rising from poverty to become a general in his youth. How many people could replicate this feat? How long did it take to become a general? He had managed to achieve this in his youth.Jun Zhan Tian had fought his way up from a lowly pauper to become a highly decorated Grand Duke. It took him forty years to achieve this feat. It\u2019s said that the flow of time creates heroes. But, the number of such heroes were \u2018far and few in between\u2019 based on the history of the continent. However, he felt helpless as he gazed at his grandson \u2013 his one and only successor; his development had been nothing short of a let-down.Grandpa Jun couldn\u2019t figure out how his family\u2019s lineage could give birth to this worthless scum. This person knew neither \u2018literary\u2019 nor \u2018martial\u2019 arts. He would grow giddy as soon as he picked-up a book, and would disappear faster than a magic rabbit as soon as he heard the word \u2018practice\u2019. The grandsons from other families were perfect. They had made a name for themselves at a young age. Their cultivation of Xuan Qi was on the right track since they were at the fifth level or above. However, his grandson\u2019s cultivation of Xuan Qi was at a miserable third level. Moreover, he had forced five teachers to quit.He was a disappointing figure. In addition, he had taught himself to eat, drink, gamble, and visit prostitutes. Jun Mo Xie had become a well-known genius in these fields. Grandpa Jun was a hero of his time. Yet, he had ended-up with a grandson like Jun Mo Xie.Grandpa Jun sighed weakly as he recalled his other two grandchildren\u2026 if only they were still alive. Then, would he have pampered this one-and-only surviving bloodline until this point? He let out a self-deprecating laugh.He hadn\u2019t cried when his son Wu Hui had died in the battle. Instead, he had boasted that his son was a brave hero. He had again held back his tears when his two grandchildren Mo You and Mo Chou too had died in the battlefield; as they were valiant heroes. He had cried for the first time when Wu Yi was crippled for life. However, he still had hope. He still had a grandson who could continue the Jun family\u2019s bloodline. Unfortunately, the grandson had turned out to be a worthless bastard \u2014 a smear on the wall that couldn\u2019t be developed in any manner.[What can I do about it?] he thought.Jun Zhan Tian hid his emotions, and asked the Young Master in a dismissive manner, \u201cI heard that you fell off the bed last night\u2026 and fainted? Is that true?!\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Jun Xie raised his head. His heart was partially doubtful, but he had finally started to understand the situation. He could answer any question through the memories left in his mind; except for this one. In fact, this question had been constantly lingering in his mind. He hadn\u2019t found anything out of the ordinary with this body since the time he had woken-up. So, how did he ended-up being transmigrated into this body? Now, he could vaguely guess\u2026 this bastard had fallen off his bed in his sleep, and had ended-up being killed by the fall!This person was truly a champion among debauchees; he was worth idolizing. To think that one could die from falling off the bed\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAn expert such as this one must be treated with respect! And, Jun Xie\u2019s heart was filled with sincere admiration for the unparalleled genius whose body he had acquired!Grandpa Jun started at him, and pounded at the table, \u201cWhat huh\u2026 huh?\u201d He couldn\u2019t help but shout as he saw Jun Xie\u2019s slothful figure, \u201cYou worthless thing! You don\u2019t even realize that someone was trying to assassinate you. If it wasn\u2019t for the protection I arranged for you\u2026 you would\u2019ve been having an audience with the King of Hell at this moment! Look at you\u2026 can\u2019t you tell me anything at all?\u201dIt seemed that this kid was assassinated. Jun Xie secretly curled his mouth, [Your so-called protection was only so-so. Your beloved grandson has already left this world while being under your \u2018protection\u2019.]Grandpa Jun was surprised to see his reaction. His idiot of a Grandson had a cowardly nature. So, how could he remain so quiet? He would\u2019ve made a huge fuss in the past upon hearing news about someone trying to assassinate him. But now, he just stood there looking slightly pale. Moreover, he seemed unbothered, and his body seemed to emanate a faint aura of coldness.Grandpa Jun couldn\u2019t believe that a chilling aura was being emanated out of his disappointing grandson\u2019s body, [Am I seeing things now?]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You\u2019ll move back here tomorrow.\u201d He felt an aching pain as he stared at Jun Xie. Jun Mo Xie was his grandson regardless of the fact that he was a debauched wretch, and a disappointing figure. Moreover, he was the last successor of the Jun family.The current state of foreign affairs was stable and peaceful in the kingdom. However, several princes had grown of age. This had led to an inevitable internal strife. Jun Zhan Tian was akin to a towering tree since he was the top military powerhouse. So, everyone wished to include him in their network of allies. The attempt to assassinate his grandson \u2013 the last heir to the Jun family \u2013 was possibly one of their strategies to stir an internal disaster. Jun Zhan Tian feared more attempts could be made on Jun Mo Xie\u2019s life if he didn\u2019t move back with him.Jun Xie flatly declined, \u201cI\u2019m very comfortable there. So, there\u2019s no need for me to move.\u201d [Are you joking? This is a rare chance to experience the techniques of this world\u2019s fellow assassins. This will all go away from me if I move here\u2026] Jun Xie\u2019s heart palpitated with excitement as he heard Grandpa Jun discuss the matter.Assassinations. A subject that seemed far away\u2026 but was still the most intimate part of his memories!\u201cYou\u2026 wretch!\u201d Grandpa Jun\u2019s anger erupted. He raised his hand to slap Jun Xie, but stopped. His face revealed a complicated look as he said, \u201cYou\u2026 just go then\u2026\u201d[Wasn\u2019t it the first time that he refused me? How did he dare to refuse me? It was a complete and utter rejection.]Jun Xie bent his body ceremoniously, and took Grandpa Jun\u2019s leave. He then turned around to walk away.\u201cOh\u2026 one more thing. You aren\u2019t allowed to pester Princess Ling Meng from today onwards. There shall be no negotiations regarding this matter. Period!\u201d Grandpa Jun spoke-up with an air of dejection and coldness.*** ***The Jun family seemingly possessed the strength to grasp even the Heavens\u2026 as though they were the only sovereigns in the Kingdom. However, the Jun family suffered from a fatal flaw \u2013 lack of a capable successor. The only living heir to the family \u2013 Jun Mo Xie \u2013 was a young debauchee. Jun Zhan Tian \u2013 a man seemingly in his forties\u2026 with a mind and body resistant towards the ravages of time \u2013 knew that the Jun family would likely to be erased from the world if he didn\u2019t do anything about the matter. This was the most inevitable outcome when Jun Mo Xie\u2019s activities were kept in view.Jun Zhan Tian had once tried to take the matter into his own hands. He had hardened himself to shamelessly ask the Emperor for His Majesty\u2019s most beloved daughter \u2013 Princess Ling Meng\u2019s hand in marriage for Jun Mo Xie. Jun Mo Xie would have a safe harbor to rely on if he was to succeed; even after Jun Zhan Tian\u2019s death. In fact, he would have an identity of royalty as the husband of the Princess. So, the Jun bloodline would be preserved\u2026 unless Jun Mo Xie made any outrageous mess.Prince Consort \u2013 the position seemed grand and magnificent. However, it was the most embarrassing of all the government positions in reality. The biggest fear for any powerful minister was to receive an Imperial order bestowing their son with a marriage with the Princess. Who would want to bring a daughter-in-law the elders of their family would have to bow to? Moreover, there were rules that needed to be observed. A Prince Consort was prohibited from taking any concubines. The family would never see good days if the Princess happened to possess a perverse personality or a heart filled with jealousy. However, this seemed to be the best insurance plan for a debauchee like Jun Mo Xie. In this way, the Jun family would at least be kept alive over the generations.Therefore, Jun Zhan Tian had willingly proposed the idea of the marriage of his grandson Jun Mo Xie with Princess Ling Meng without any feeling of agitation or intimidation.Grandpa Jun was like an elder brother to the Emperor. His Majesty had understood the intention behind his old comrade\u2019s proposal. He was moved by Jun Zhan Tian\u2019s predicament. In fact, he had even considered the matter carefully for a long time. But, he had finally refused the offer owing to Jun Mo Xie\u2019s history, and everything that he had done. And, more specifically\u2026 due to Princess Ling Meng\u2019s refusal!\u201cIt\u2019s not that your younger brother isn\u2019t willing to help you, Brother Jun. But, I\u2019m a father. How can I marry my most beloved daughter \u2013 Ling Meng to a\u2026 Ah!\u201d His Majesty had lowered his head out of respect. This had caused Jun Zhan Tian to lose his breath.[A father\u2026? Consideration for your daughter\u2026? Wouldn\u2019t you have been filled with joy if I had brought this proposal to you a decade back\u2026 when the Jun family was in its most prosperous period?] Grandpa Jun\u2019s heart was filled with resentment.*** ***Jun Xie stood at the doorway. He replied lightly, \u201cOh, I understand\u201d. There was neither shock nor joy in his voice; his tone was like a bowl of plain water. Then, he walked out.Jun Mo Xie had started to consider himself as the Prince Consort of Princess Ling Meng ever since he had learnt about Grandpa Jun\u2019s proposal. In fact, he had even started to stalk the Princess; he had vexed her to no end. Grandpa Jun was surprised to see that Jun Mo Xie had taken the news of rejection with indifference. He had expected Jun Mo Xie to become angry or hysterical. He wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if Jun Mo Xie had gone cursing out into the streets. However, Jun Mo Xie\u2019s indifferent attitude had left him in shock.\u201cHas the fall from the bed changed his character?\u201d Grandpa Jun stroked his beard as he stared at the departing figure of his grandson.Jun Zhan Tian clapped his hands and ordered, \u201cArrange a few more experts to guard the Young Master at night. I don\u2019t want any more mishaps. Kill any suspicious person on the spot.\u201d [Don\u2019t even think about trying this a second time. You think that you can just waltz in here\u2026 and take the life of Jun Zhan Tian\u2019s grandson?] Grandpa Jun\u2019s eyes flashed with coldness.Grandpa Jun seemed to have given these orders to thin air within the empty room. But then\u2026 the voice of a man resounded from somewhere, \u201cUnderstood!\u201dJun Xie walked out into the sunlight, and started to advance towards his courtyard. The warm rays of sun shone on his face. He met several servants along the way. They bowed to him in fear and trepidation. However, Jun Xie didn\u2019t notice any of them since he was lost in his thoughts.Nobody knew the thoughts that were echoing within Jun Xie\u2019s mind.[What\u2019s an assassin?

He murmured, \u201cThe current me is nothing more than a worthless freeloading\u2026 second generation figurehead waiting for death\u2019s call.\u201d\u201cWrong!

He was seated on a wheelchair with a thick layer of satin over his legs. He was staring at Jun Xie with his bright eyes. His eyebrows were like swords; they slanted upwards towards his temple. His body vibrated a natural aura of coldness and killing intent. A faint glint of contempt flashed deep within his falcon-like eyes; it was obvious even though it wasn\u2019t much.He would\u2019ve been a handsome man with the qualities of a prosperous persona\u2026 if not for his disabled legs. He looked like an outstanding, fearless, and steel-bodied hero. It could be easily judged with the residual aura of the might that was evident within his eyebrows\u2026 that he was once a highly decisive and powerful army general \u2013 who commanded tens of thousands in a bloody war.\u201cThird Uncle?\u201d Jun Xie stopped walking as he saw Jun Wu Yi \u2014 the man who was seated on the wheelchair. Jun Xie recalled from Jun Mo Xie\u2019s memories that this Third Uncle had now become incapable of doing anything; except for remaining seated on his wheelchair. This was another messed-up freeloader waiting for his time to end. But, Jun Xie sensed a very familiar aura emitting out of this Third Uncle; it sent a chill down his spine.A killing intent!An intent so thick that it stirred even Jun Xie\u2019s heart.One must\u2019ve been baptized within the fires of a hundred battles in order to possess such a distinctive fighting spirit; one must be an iron-willed war veteran who had fought his way out through mountains of corpses and a sea of blood. This aura was akin to a peerless blade\u2019s ray of sharpness\u2026 that couldn\u2019t be buried even after it was broken\u2026 a coercive brilliance that could shine throughout the skies.However, that peerless blade had now been wrapped in its sheath.Jun Xie had met \u2013 at the most \u2013 two or three individuals of such high class in his entire life. And, each one of them had held a monumental position within the military. Jun Xie held such iron-blooded and valiant generals in high regards. Grandpa Jun was also such an individual. However, he was an aged veteran whose cultivation had allowed him to restrain his aura. So, he could keep it hidden at all times. Therefore, Jun Xie had failed to detect it even though his meeting with Grandpa Jun had lasted for a few minutes.However, Jun Wu Yi hadn\u2019t yet achieved a state where he could successfully restrain his aura. His entire being was no different from a peerless sword. An awe-inspiring sword Qi could be felt leaking out of the blade even though it was kept under the sheath. Obviously, one needed to possess Jun Xie\u2019s level of awareness to detect it. Ordinary men like Jun Mo Xie would never realize this\u2026 even if they were beaten to death.This peerless sword could emit howls of the dragon in the midst of the night\u2026 even if it was cast aside and was left to hang on the wall. The howl signified a thirst for blood; a thirst that had been engraved into its bones.\u201cYou rarely call me Third Uncle,\u201d Jun Wu Yi raised his head. His dark eyes glanced at his nephew in a cynical manner as he asked, \u201cMo Xie, it seems that you\u2019re interested in becoming a second generation ancestor\u2026\u201d Jun Wu Yi wondered what was wrong with him \u2013 why did he feel like talking to a smear on the wall that couldn\u2019t be developed.Jun Xie looked at Jun Wu Yi\u2019s disabled waist and legs for a long time. Suddenly, he laughed, \u201cYou must be joking, Third Uncle. You\u2019re the genuine second generation figurehead. I\u2019m\u2026 at best\u2026 the third generation. A peaceful and happy life of a third generation is more than enough for me.\u201d[Eh? Why is this kid speaking to me in such a tone today? His words still have thorns\u2026 but they lack the arrogance and bossiness of the past.]A sharp radiance flashed within Jun Wu Yi\u2019s eyes; it was akin to a brilliant ray of lightning piercing through the darkness of the night sky. He shook his head as he laughed, \u201cDo you even know the difference between a second generation ancestor and a third generation ancestor?\u201d\u201cOh? Aren\u2019t they the same worthless freeloaders waiting for the death\u2019s call? Is there really any difference?\u201d Jun Xie raised his eyebrows and said. He couldn\u2019t help but feel saddened by looking at a respectable iron-blooded man like Jun Wu Yi \u2013 whose glare could scare even the lightning and thunder \u2013 fall into such a sorry state.A trace of bitterness and unwillingness glimmered in Jun Wu Yi\u2019s eyes, and dissipated. He raised his head, and placed his hands on his lap. He then said, \u201cNo Difference? The two of them are worlds apart! The second generation ancestors are the fathers who laid the foundation with their blood\u2026 so that their sons can sit back and enjoy the fruits of their labor. The sons won\u2019t face any difficulty in their lives. They\u2019ll not die as long as they are born with a mouth capable of eating. They can even enjoy a life of luxuries. But, that is not the case with the third generation ancestors.\u201dHe looked at Jun Xie in the eye and laughed. Then, he continued, \u201cThe so-called third generation ancestors are those who become the successors of the third generation. They are not necessarily the ones born into the third generation. That is to say\u2026 your grandfather laid the foundations\u2026 but the line was severed in the middle during your father\u2019s era. That led our family towards the third generation. You and I would\u2019ve been the second generation ancestors if your father were still alive; me from your grandfather\u2019s generation\u2026 and you from your father\u2019s. That would\u2019ve been the only difference.\u201cEven if you have the determination to become a third generation ancestor\u2026 you\u2019ll not be able to hold that position for a long time. There are no \u2018trees\u2019 for you to seek protection from; except your grandfather. But, he has grown old. So, your life as the third generation ancestor is likely to be very tough; it\u2019s impossible for those lacking in ability and determination. So, I\u2019m comparatively luckier than you since I\u2019m the second generation ancestor.\u201dJun Wu Yi had spoken these words to counter Jun Xie\u2019s phrase \u2013\u201duseless freeloader waiting for death\u2019s call.\u201d However, a feeling of sadness surged through his heart as he continued to speak. [Is this truly the end for the great Jun family?] A family which had once risen to prominence had now fallen to such a degree! Both of his brothers were martyrs of the war, while he had been paralyzed. He had placed his hopes on his two nephews. But, they too had died in a battle; their bodies had been lost. The only successor of the Jun family\u2019s bloodline was the idiotic waste Jun Mo Xie.Suddenly, Jun Wu Yi found himself losing interest. In fact, he didn\u2019t even have the strength to say anything further.Jun Xie remained silent for a moment. Then, he let out a laugh, \u201cActually, I too can be a second generation ancestor.\u201d How could Jun Xie not understand Jun Wu Yi\u2019s words? He had only wanted Jun Wu Yi to say these words.\u201cOh?\u201d Jun Wu Yi asked in a lazy manner.\u201cIf Third Uncle can become a \u2018tree\u2019\u2026 and create a comfortable spot for me\u2026 then would I not be able to become a second generation ancestor?\u201d Jun Xie asked with a smile.There was a trace of fury in Jun Wu Yi\u2019s eyes. He asked in a low voice, \u201cMo Xie, are you taunting your uncle?\u201dJun Xie stared at him. He then asked, \u201cIs there any sense of awareness in your legs?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d Jun Wu Yi turned his head to the other side. He was becoming more and more annoyed with his nephew. Jun Mo Xie knew that he didn\u2019t like hearing about his disability\u2026 and yet that brat continued to bring it up. He was at least indirect about it in the past. But, he was talking about it on in his face at this moment. They were better off without a descendant who didn\u2019t even show respect towards his elders.\u201cWas your waist ever broken before?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d Jun Wu Yi\u2019s temper erupted, \u201cDarned brat! Would I be still living if my back was broken?\u201d\u201cThis means that only your meridians are damaged? Were you dealt with an underhanded move?\u201d Jun Xie\u2019s eyes lit-up. It seemed that someone had either severed his meridians, or had eroded it with the help of some insidious poison which had caused them to shrink and wither. If that was the case \u2014 then there was still hope as long as there was no deficiency in his blood or Qi. Then, there was an opportunity for recovery if Jun Xie\u2019s knowledge of medicines served him properly. After all, this man was his blood relative. Moreover, he was an iron-blooded man who had impressed Jun Xie with his towering fighting spirit.Jun Xie looked at him and asked, \u201cI heard that you were hurt on the battlefield. But, it would be easier for someone to kill you rather than do this to you. Why would they do that? Whoever did this to you wanted you to suffer a life worse than death.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euJun Xie\u2019s words stabbed Jun Wu Yi at the sore spot in his heart. He clenched his teeth. The veins on his forehead convulsed a few times. He couldn\u2019t control himself, and started to take deep breaths. \u201cWhat does this have to do with you?\u201dJun Xie smiled as he realized that he had guessed correctly. He moved to the front, and held on to the wheelchair. He then asked, \u201cThird Uncle, do you want to take revenge?\u201d\u201cLook at me! How can I even talk about revenge?\u201d Jun Wu Yi\u2019s face was flushed red. Extreme hatred flashed in his eyes as his face fluctuated. He let out a sigh after a long time and said, \u201cThe current me is nothing more than a basket case.\u201dJun Xie smiled, \u201cWhat if I had the ability to make you stand up again, Third Uncle?\u201dThis sentence felt like a thunderous explosion to Jun Wu Yi\u2019s ears.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, his words felt like thunderclaps resounding through the skies to Jun Wu Yi\u2019s ears.Jun Wu Yi\u2019s eyes were wide open. A layer of brilliant yellow glow emitted out of his body; so much so that no one could dare to look at him. He grabbed Jun Xie\u2019s arm with an unusual strength, and asked in an eager manner, \u201cMo Xie, are you saying that you have the means to cure me?\u201dJun Wu Yi hadn\u2019t stopped practicing his Xuan Qi cultivation while he had recuperated. The layer of yellow light emitting out of his body symbolized the strength of an Earth Xuan ranked expert. Jun Wu Yi\u2019s achievements were quite rare in correspondence to his age; even though he was only at the early stages.One could rarely find an Earth Xuan ranked expert in the Tian Xiang Kingdom. Jun Wu Yi had climbed to the Earth Xuan rank in only thirty years; this feat was similar to that of a sky-shaking genius. His strength would\u2019ve entered a higher stage if the meridians of his lower body weren\u2019t severely defective.Cracking sounds issued out of Jun Xie\u2019s arm due to Jun Wu Yi\u2019s powerful grip. However, his face didn\u2019t show even the slightest trace of pain. He remained calm and indifferent. He smiled and replied, \u201cI can\u2019t guarantee it\u2026 but I can try.\u201dSuddenly, Jun Wu Yi became aware of his surroundings, and retracted his arm. A trace of doubt crept up in his mind as he looked at his own hands. He turned towards Jun Xie and asked, \u201cWeren\u2019t you in pain? Why aren\u2019t you crying?\u201d\u201cIt did pain. But, would the pain stop if I cried? If so\u2026 then I would\u2019ve definitely cried out loud. But\u2026 unfortunately\u2026 it isn\u2019t so,\u201d Jun Xie replied.Jun Wu Yi was startled to see the indifferent look on Jun Xie\u2019s face. Suddenly, he laughed out loudly and said, \u201cHaha! Now you have at least managed to convince me that you can cure me.\u201d[This nephew of mine seems different from before], Jun Wu Yi thought.\u201cFor now\u2026 your body needs to be massaged thrice a day \u2013 in the morning, afternoon, and evening. If possible\u2026 get servants with a background in martial arts to massage along your meridians. Moreover, you must soak your body in hot water every night\u2026 for an hour. No breaks are allowed in this routine. We can start your treatment when the preparations on my side are done. Is that alright?\u201d Jun Xie smiled.Jun Wu Yi controlled his emotions and said, \u201cVery well, Mo Xie! Third Uncle is willing to trust you this time.\u201d His hands slowly balled-up into a fist as he said, \u201cI\u2019ll accept it\u2026 even if it fails.\u201d However, he didn\u2019t say something else that he felt, [I\u2019ll accept it\u2026 even if you\u2019re just messing around with me.]A strand of hope is better than none at all.However, Jun Xie sensed something wasn\u2019t right. \u201cThird Uncle would surely have consulted many doctors during these years of being restricted to the wheelchair.\u201d Jun Xie checked Jun Wu Yi\u2019s body again, and realized that he wasn\u2019t in a positive state. The meridians at his waist had been completely blocked-off. Moreover, a heretical drug was slowly eroding his meridians. In fact, his muscles would\u2019ve started to suffer from atrophy if it not for the high level of care and maintenance. That would\u2019ve made him a cripple in the true sense, and would\u2019ve left no scope for recovery. How could the high level doctors not detect that?\u201cThe well-known doctors from all over the kingdom have been invited to cure me. But, none of them have been successful. I was attacked with an insidious skill, and it sealed off my meridians. Moreover, I was inflicted with a highly peculiar and toxic poison which left me with a life worse than death. We didn\u2019t find any drugs that could fight off against this poison,\u201d Jun Wu Yi replied with a face full of hate. \u201cFather had tried to break the insidious seal on my meridians several times. But, it hasn\u2019t yielded any results. It seems that the only possible way to force out the poison is to utilize an extremely powerful Xuan Qi.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case\u2026 then why\u2026\u201d Jun Xie asked, but stopped midway.\u201cI was attacked by Sky Xuan ranked experts. We would need the help of a Spirit Xuan ranked expert in order to unlock their seal and force out the poison. But, Spirit Xuan experts are near mythical existences\u2026 who would only meet with the heads of organizations\u2026 and not the tails. Moreover, a Spirit Xuan expert would lose half of his strength to cure me\u2026 due to severe exposure to the poison\u2026 with no chance of ever recovering.\u201dJun Wu Yi smiled bitterly and said, \u201cWhich Spirit Xuan ranked expert would make such a big sacrifice for me? Mo Xie, achieving such high level of cultivation is as hard as ascending to the Heavens. Who in his right mind will throw away half of his life\u2019s worth of cultivation for my sake?\u201d\u201cWhat a fate! This person has thrown you into a state where you know the way to treat yourself\u2026 and yet that method is unattainable\u2026\u201d Jun Xie shook his head. \u201cIt seems that this guy\u2019s hatred for you is beyond ordinary. He has used such a sinister method to torment you. His intention must\u2019ve been to neither leave a path of life for you\u2026 nor the will to die.\u201d Jun Xie paused. Then, he asked unexpectedly, \u201cWere these people our family\u2019s blood enemies?\u201d\u201cMo Xie, you\u2026. where did you find a way to treat me?\u201d Jun Wu Yi\u2019s eyes flickered with pain as he heard Jun Xie\u2019s question. But, he didn\u2019t answer him. Instead, he looked at Jun Xie with an evaluating expression. \u201cYou seem to be an entirely different person today.\u201d\u201cThird Uncle, your ailment has always been in my mind\u2026 day and night,\u201d Jun Xie broke out into a sweat. \u201cI found this method by accident. It seems promising. So, I thought that I should try it out. We are related by blood, Third Uncle. It\u2019s natural that I wish for you to get better. But, it\u2019s also for my sake. I wish to be protected\u2026 and live a stable life as a second generation ancestor. That\u2019s the kind of person I am. It can\u2019t be helped\u2026 hahaha!\u201d\u201cYou stinking brat!\u201d Jun Wu Yi scoffed. But then, he resumed his solemn expression and said, \u201cMo Xie, your Third Uncle accepts this act of kindness from you\u2026 regardless of whether you succeed or fail,\u201d his voice rang out loud and clear.\u201cThird Uncle, wait for the day when you can offer me shelter. Then, I\u2019ll become a second generation ancestor\u2026 hahaha!\u201d Jun Xie checked his state again before he made his mind up. He thought that he could use a three pronged treatment to cure Jun Wu Yi by increasing his own internal energy and with his knowledge of acupuncture and medicinal drugs.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euJun Xie had asked Jun Wu Yi to undergo the massages only to buy time. At present, he didn\u2019t have the slightest bit of internal energy. However, the acupuncture treatment required a huge amount of energy in order to work.Jun Wu Yi\u2019s eyes lit-up as he heard Jun Xie\u2019s confident words. He smiled and spoke, \u201cMo Xie, your level of Xuan Qi cultivation is only at the Third Level. It isn\u2019t stronger than an average commoner. But, you still withstood my powerful grip without even batting an eyelid. You won\u2019t be an ordinary second generation ancestor\u2026 with such a character and endurance.\u201dJun Wu Yi hadn\u2019t gripped Jun Xie\u2019s arm with his full strength. But, how can an ordinary laymen endure the grasp of an Earth Xuan ranked expert? Even a Gold Xuan ranked expert would\u2019ve wrinkled his eyebrows in reaction. However, Jun Mo Xie had the negligible cultivation of a Third level Xuan Qi. And yet, he had been able to endure it. Moreover, he hadn\u2019t even utilized his own Xuan Qi to resist.Jun Wu Yi knew the level of pain that Jun Xie must\u2019ve had to endure. Moreover, the pain was inflicted on him when he was the least prepared. But still, he hadn\u2019t even flinched. This level of mind\u2026[What a pity\u2026] Jun Wu Yi sighed as he looked at Jun Xie. [\u2026 What a pity that Jun Mo Xie\u2019s age is too advanced.

He then said, \u201cIt\u2019s extremely important for you to select people who are trustworthy; especially the ones who\u2019ll be responsible for your massages. This entire matter should remain confidential\u2026 Otherwise, both of us will lose face in case the treatment fails.\u201dThe Third Uncle laughed and replied, \u201cNo one should be informed even if we\u2019re successful. I\u2019m not an idiot! Your only fear is that this matter will invite trouble for us, right? You and I should be the perfect hidden cards for our Jun family\u2026 once I\u2019m cured. How can I not know about something like this? You little devil\u2026 you even tried to use your Third Uncle\u2019s reputation as an excuse.\u201dJun Wu Yi let out a laugh, and pinched his face. Suddenly, it crossed his mind that this brat was once his treasured nephew. However, the two of them hadn\u2019t been this close in a long time.\u00a0But perhaps, it was only because of this reason that he had such a strange feeling when he saw him again.Could it be that Jun Mo Xie had portrayed the image of a debauchee all these years in order to hide a different face underneath? Jun Wu Yi was overwhelmed with anticipation as he looked at Jun Xie\u2026 who had turned around to walk away.Jun Wu Yi seemed to be more curious to know if his nephew genuinely had a hidden face; in fact, he desired to know this even more than his own chances of getting cured.\u201cThird Uncle, you\u2019ve reached the Earth Xuan rank, right?\u201d Jun Xie laughed and asked.\u201cYou peeping tom!\u201d Jun Wu Yi chuckled; he felt an incomparable sense of cheerfulness. He continued, \u201cI\u2019ve achieved it just this year\u2026 but it isn\u2019t stabilized yet.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re being modest.\u201d Jun Xie curled his lips, \u201cWhat\u2019s above the Earth Xuan rank?\u201dJun Wu Yi was startled. He explained, \u201cXuan Qi cultivation begins with the nine levels. After these levels comes the Silver, Gold and Jade levels. Above them comes the Earth Xuan, Sky Xuan and the Spirit Xuan.\u201cThe released Xuan Qi is noticeable in the first three levels. The colors are light-red, pink-red and thick-red. The color for the next three stages \u2013 fourth to sixth \u2013 is purple. The color from the seventh to ninth stages is black. Mo Xie, you must be extremely careful about these signs when you go outside. One careless in interpretation can result in a disaster.\u201d\u201cI understand, Third Uncle,\u201d Jun Xie smiled and replied with an indifferent face.Jun Wu Yi continued to speak in a passionate manner, \u201cThe Silver level is the beginning\u2026 the Golden level is growth\u2026 and the Jade level signifies a budding process. But, the ninth level and below are insignificant. Earth Xuan splits everything, the Sky Xuan leaves only the air in its midst, and the Spirit Xuan becomes formless; it can only be compared to the Nine Heavens\u2026 an entity that transforms into a soaring dragon.\u201cThese are the recitals for the Xuan Qi stages. One is considered to be a beginner only when he has reached the Silver Xuan. As for you\u2026\u201d Jun Wu Yi looked at Jun Xie with a gentle look in his eyes, \u201cYou\u2019ve your own path to tread. Being a man doesn\u2019t necessarily mean killing with one\u2019s own hands.\u201dJun Xie replied with a smile, \u201cI understand, Third Uncle. I\u2019m not someone who kills people all the time.\u201d He added in his mind, [I\u2019m not someone who kills people without any reward. But, there\u2019s an exception to this condition \u2013 Don\u2019t mess with me!]Jun Xie didn\u2019t have any interest in Xuan Qi. So, he didn\u2019t put any effort to understand it. He started to walk with a slow pace after Jun Wu Yi had left for his room. He then changed his route, and started to walk towards the library.Jun Xie had to visit the library as the previous Third Young Master Jun had too little information in his brain. His head was devoid of any useful information; except for the information related to sensual pleasures, gambling, eating, and drinking. He was a sticky blob of worthless mud. So, it was impossible for Jun Xie to derive any useful information from his memories. Therefore, he needed some time to reorganize his memories. He needed to at least tidy it up in order to understand the state of the Jun family. After all, the Third Young Master Jun\u2019s brain had no useful information in this regard either.Jun Xie spent his entire day in the library; he didn\u2019t go out even once.An old man bowed before Jun Zhan Tian in his study to report Jun Xie\u2019s whereabouts, \u201cSenior Master, the Young Master had a long chat with the Third Master after he left your place. The Third Master seemed quite happy after he talked with the Young Master. In fact, he has never looked so happy in the recent years.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Jun Zhan Tian had always maintained a calm demeanor. However, his calmness was shattered as he heard these words; he looked stunned. Jun Wu Yi and Jun Mo Xie had always been as incompatible as fire and water; so much so that they ridiculed each other every single time they met. Their eyes would become sore as soon as they saw each other. [How on Heaven\u2019s earth could these two strike a peaceful conversation? In fact, they had a good chat!] What was most surprising was that Jun Wu Yi had ended up becoming happy from that conversation. It wouldn\u2019t have been far-fetched to consider this occurrence as an abnormal incident.Jun Zhan Tian sipped his tea, and asked in a casual tone, \u201cWhat were they talking about?\u201d\u201cThe Third Master has cultivated himself to a great place in the recent years\u2026 even though he\u2019s disabled. He\u2019s now at the early Earth Xuan stage. So, I didn\u2019t dare to go too close to him\u2026 I couldn\u2019t overhear their conversation. I was only able to see the Third Master and Young Master chatting happily\u2026 and agreeing with each other,\u201d the old man answered respectfully.\u201cAgreeing with each other?\u201d Jun Zhan Tian stroked his beard, \u201cHow is that possible? It was fortunate enough that none of them died after being in each other\u2019s company for so long. And, you say that they had been agreeing with each other?\u201d\u201cThis is absolutely true! Moreover, the Young Master headed straight to the library building after he met with the Third Master. In fact, he\u2019s still in the library. I think it\u2019s of minimal importance since there aren\u2019t many external factors or influences in the library. But, the matter of the Young Master having a conversation with the Third Master is too surprising. So, I decided to report it to you, Senior Master.\u201d\u201cYou did the right thing. But wait, did you say that this kid went into the\u2026 library building?!\u201d Jun Zhan Tian\u2019s beard trembled. His eyes widened in shock, \u201cAre you sure that the little bastard Jun Mo Xie went into the library building\u2026 instead of the Ten Thousand Flowers Pavilion, the Wafting Fragrance Pavilion, and other such places?\u201dThe old man nodded, \u201cThere\u2019s no mistake, Senior Master. It was certainly the library building.\u201dJun Zhan Tian jumped-up from his seat, and started to pace back-and-forth in the room. His usual calm face revealed a deep frown. He tugged at his beard and asked, \u201cOld Pang, do you have any idea what this bastard plans to do inside the library building?\u201d Suddenly, he stopped walking. \u201cHe won\u2019t set it on fire\u2026 would he?\u201dOld Pang restrained his desire to laugh and replied, \u201cThe Young Master was reading books inside the library. He was very quiet. I felt that he won\u2019t be leaving from there anytime soon. So, I came here to report the matter to you.\u201d\u201cReading books?!\u201d Grandpa Jun cried out in surprise, and tugged out a strand of his beard. He then curled his lips and asked, \u201cIs he genuinely reading the books?\u201d\u201cHe is, Senior Master.\u201dJun Zhan Tian thought for a while. He then waved his hand and said, \u201cIt\u2019s good to read; let him read. But, bring the books that he\u2019s going through to me once he has left the library. I\u2019m curious to know what he\u2019s planning. Is that possible that he\u2019s looking for erotic paintings? Well\u2026 it\u2019s alright in that case\u2026 he\u2019s coming of age now. It\u2019s no big deal. I still remember\u2026hehe.. Old pang, don\u2019t allow anyone to bother that kid.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cUnderstood, Senior Master.\u201dJun Zhan Tian continued to pace around the room for some time. Then, he looked at the sky to calm himself down. He thought, [If he isn\u2019t looking for erotic paintings\u2026 is it possible that this kid has finally woken-up\u2026 and has decided to change himself into a better person?] He shook his head and sighed, [This old man needs to go\u2026 and burn some incense sticks and pray to the spirits of the ancestors if that\u2019s the case\u2026]The butler \u2013 Old Pang \u2014 rushed to the library in the night in order to fetch the books read by Jun Xie.\u00a0He found a few dozen books bundled over each other.Jun Zhan Tian laid down those book on the table; he was frowning.\u201cXuan Xuan Continent\u2019s Current Situation, Continental Travelogue, Continental Mountains\u2019 Records, Person of the Year List, Records of Strange Flowers and Exotic Grasses, Continental Wars Discussion, Xuan Xuan Art of War\u2026\u201d Grandpa Jun spent the entire night in looking over the books read by his grandson. His expressions continued to change in confusion, surprise, and happiness. He sighed, puffed, shook his head, and nodded. It seemed that he had used-up half of his entire life\u2019s facial expressions in a single night\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He would wake-up in the morning, and would head straight to the library. Then, he would stay there the entire day. There were no exceptions to this routine. Grandpa Jun would go through the books read by him on a regular basis. Grandpa Jun\u2019s expressions would change from disappointment to shock, and then to pleasure\u2026 It seemed that Grandpa Jun had yet to exhaust the entire range of his facial expressions.The servants of the Jun family assumed that their Young Master had picked-up another peculiar hobby. He would remain in the library building throughout the day, and would walk out and sit in the courtyard during the night. Moreover, the spot that he had chosen to sit was the darkest corner of the courtyard; it was far away from the reach of light.The servants didn\u2019t seemed to be concerned about his new hobby. After all, it was better than his past \u2018hobbies\u2019.Jun Xie was seated under a flower tree at the moment. He was enjoying the dark aura of the night. It was so dark that one couldn\u2019t spot one\u2019s own hand. However, Jun Xie was feeling safe and secure. The darkness of the night was naturally the safest place for someone who used to be a master of assassins and an invincible personality. The night had always been Jun Xie\u2019s best and most reliable partner.Jun Xie felt as if he was in a dream as he gazed at the stars. He had read several books containing information on this world in the past few days. So, the situation in the continent had become more or less clear to him. However, he became more and more confused as he continued to read.Jun Xie would\u2019ve assumed that he had landed himself in an ancient Kingdom if it wasn\u2019t for the black and white letters in the books. The people, the accents, the culture, and the clothing seemed similar to that of the Tang and Song dynasties. In fact, they were too similar.Jun Xie sunk his head between his knees, and held the back of his head with both hands. He groaned as he thought, [Why? Why is this not the ancient era of my country? I would be in such an advantageous position then. The resources that I have concerning those eras would have been really useful. I could\u2019ve taken advantage of my foreknowledge\u2026 even if I don\u2019t wish to change history. It could\u2019ve put those divine prophets to shame\u2026 and coast my way through history while avoiding any misfortune.][Xuan Xuan Continent, where in the damned hell is this place? Gold Xuan, Silver Xuan, Earth Xuan, Sky Xuan\u2026 Xuan Qi\u2026 Xuan your granddaddy!!! Why is it not internal martial arts?]The only things that had remained familiar was the sun, moon, and the pleasant night. And, only these things felt familiar to Jun Xie.Jun Xie\u2019s face looked like a cold stone; his cheeks throbbed with pain as he restrained himself from cursing out at the Heavens.He started to feel a violent headache as he struggled through the surge of extreme emotions. He couldn\u2019t retain a calm face even with his extraordinary endurance; his face grimaced in pain. The headache soon turned into dizziness.He felt as if the world around him was rotating at an unbelievable speed. The night sky seemed to his eyes like an insane show of madness. The whole world seemed unreal to him; like an illusory existence.Jun Xie panted and bit his lip in pain; the blood flowed down his lips. He glared ahead as he went through the pain without letting out a single sound.[I was alone when I came into this world. So, I\u2019ll bear this pain alone. I can only depend on myself in this strange world\u2026 and no one else. I\u2019ll never depend on anyone else.][Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! I\u2019ll use my killing skills\u2026 and will forge a path of blood\u2026 will wipe-out the skies\u2026 and will obliterate the lands\u2026 Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!]Jun Xie felt hazy. Suddenly, something appeared in his realm of consciousness. It seemed to be a spark of distant light. However, it seemed to be moving closer to him. It started to become clearer, brighter, and bigger as it got closer. It finally transformed into a luminescent rainbow-colored pagoda. It seemed extremely brilliant, and kept on rotating within his consciousness. A vivid form of sagely radiance was being emitted out with each of its rotation.Jun Xie continued to stare ahead with bloody eyes even though his limbs were paralyzed, his body numb, and his consciousness slowly dying. He continued to glare at the unusual realm without batting an eye.A gust of a wind blew past him after an undetermined period of time. Jun Xie started to feel cold.[The early autumn night is still chilly.] Jun Xie realized something as this thought crossed his mind, [I can feel the cold. This means that my senses are working again. But, was I not already\u2026] He got up and realized that he was covered in cold sweat. His clothes were drenched in his sweat to the point of being uncomfortable.Jun Xie felt as if he was a new-born in this world.Jun Xie had woken-up inside Jun Mo Xie\u2019s body. He had tried to support his body by migrating his mind and soul into it. However, Jun Xie had remained Jun Xie. But now, he felt that he had fused into Jun Mo Xie\u2019s body by going through that pain. Now, Jun Xie had become Jun Mo Xie \u2013 the true master of this body.Jun Xie disregarded the messy state of his body, and sat down cross-legged. He then closed his eyes. He pushed his spiritual awareness into his consciousness as he tried to understand something. Jun Xie knew that the extreme pain that he had felt earlier was due to the presence of a small pagoda within his body. However, he realized that the pagoda did something else too. Otherwise, would why he feel so much pain through the simple process of the fusion of soul and flesh? Jun Xie was certain that something else had also happened. He realized that he could only rely on the small pagoda. Also, he would never feel satisfied until he understood what exactly had happened.Jun Xie felt that he could clearly \u2018see\u2019 the pagoda in his consciousness. It was glowing with brilliance of seven colors, and was rotating atop his consciousness. Jun Xie could clearly see that each of its rotation was in sync with his body\u2019s Qi and blood flow. It was being synchronized repeatedly in an endless cycle.[What\u2019s happening here?] Jun Xie looked at the pagoda in surprise. He had always been a strong disbeliever. Yet, he felt confused as he realized that the pagoda\u2019s capabilities had surpassed the boundaries of common sense.[I wonder if I can get closer and take a better look.] Jun Xie was still thinking when the small pagoda started to grow bigger in size. Suddenly, the door of the lowest level of the pagoda opened, and a thick white mist emerged out of it. Jun Xie\u2019s awareness started to fuse with that white mist. The mist was so thick that it almost looked solid. Jun Xie took a deep breath. He felt as if a sense of calm had taken over him. He felt an utter sense of comfort. Even his soul rose to a level where it wanted to sing happily\u2026He observed his surroundings, and was surprised to realize that he had arrived right in front of the pagoda. He saw two words inscribed above his head in an ancient language \u2013 Hongjun Pagoda.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe entered the room. He saw it was empty; except for the white mist that floated around him. Suddenly, the thick mist moved, and gathered together to form two rows of words \u2013 Nine Layered Exquisite Pagoda \u2013 First Eternal Art.The mist then rolled and formed a hazy-looking formula in Jun Xie\u2019s awareness. Jun Xie was startled. But then, the characters, symbols, and drawings moved and formed a revolving spiral. Jun Xie felt a vast amount of information entering into his awareness. It felt as if a huge train had entered into a small hut. However, the train continued to rush without causing any damage to the hut.Suddenly, Jun Xie started to feel dizzy. He felt as if his head was going to explode. Then, he fell to the ground.He opened his eyes, and realized that he lay on the same cold spot as before. However, he realized that the cultivation formula still existed in his consciousness. He could also see the diagrams that represented the pathways throughout the human body. The accompanying forms and actions were also present.Jun Xie clenched his fists. His eyes shone brightly as he mumbled aloud, \u201cThe Art of Unlocking Heaven\u2019s Fortune!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Moreover, such an encounter was something that was extremely difficult to come across. The \u2018Art of Unlocking Heaven\u2019s Fortune\u2019 had turned out to be extremely mysterious. Jun Xie was certain that it was far superior to any other art. Moreover, he was sure that the Nine Layered Exquisite Pagoda was an incomparable treasure.Jun Xie was ignorant. However, he had heard of the mythical legend of the Great God Hongjun. This Great God is the Master of the Three Great Sage Gods \u2013 Taishang Dao Jun or the Honoured Lord of the Dao and its Virtue, Yuanshi Tianzun or the Honoured Lord of the Origin, and Tongtian Jiaozhu or the Grandmaster of Heaven. These people were great individuals, and didn\u2019t have any equal under the Heavens. The abilities of the pagoda were undeniable since it was named after the Great God Hongjun.Jun Xie had an overwhelming desire to practice the Art of Unlocking Heaven\u2019s Fortune. However, he controlled his urge. He calmed down, and started to inspect his body. He couldn\u2019t help but be surprised.The surface of his skin was covered by a thick layer of a muddy liquid. It was black and greenish in colour. An unbelievably foul stench was emitting out of it.Suddenly, a name with a legendary origin appeared within his consciousness, [Pulp Rending Meridian Cleanser? Can it be that the entireties of my body\u2019s impurities have been ejected after I went through that extreme pain?] Jun Xie was ecstatic. In fact, he wouldn\u2019t have minded another round of such pain if it could have such a miraculous effect.Jun Xie wouldn\u2019t be concerned with any amount of pain as long as it had a positive effect on his physical strength. It wasn\u2019t a big deal for him to deal with any amount of pain for the benefit of his bodily strength. Any amount of pain was worth-it in that case; no matter how unbearable it was.Jun Xie stood up in an excited manner. He ignored the stench emitting out of his body, and started to run towards a pond in his residence. Then, he jumped into the pond without any hesitation.Suddenly, several voices were heard, \u201cWho\u2019s it?\u201dHe snorted and replied, \u201cMe! The Young Master is taking a bath. No one is allowed to disturb me.\u201d\u201cAh, it\u2019s the Young Master.\u201d No more sounds were heard after that.*** ***Grandpa Jun wrinkled his eyebrows in his study, \u201cWhat was that?\u201dButler Pang rushed out to check. He returned after a short while, and bowed, \u201cIt\u2019s the Young Master. I\u2019ve heard that he jumped into the Setting Moon pond to take a bath.\u201d\u201cA bath in the Setting Moon pond at this hour of the night\u2026?\u201d Grandpa Jun became angry. His nose became twisted, and his breath became short. He shouted in a rough tone, \u201cThis damned creature!\u201d He then went to sleep.He had been expecting his grandson to turn into a new and better person since the last few days. But, his hopes had been crushed. Now, there was only a feeling of extreme discomfort in his heart.The greater the hopes are\u2026 the greater is the disappointment when the hopes shatter. Grandpa Jun wanted to drag Jun Mo Xie inside, and beat his bottom with a stick until it \u2018blossomed\u2019 like a peachy flower. This ungrateful person would then realize why the flowers were so \u2018red\u2019.Jun Xie\u2019s body floated quietly on the surface of the water. He used his hands and feet to stabilize his body from time to time; this prevented him from sinking in the water. He felt a feeling of comfort washing over his body.Jun Xie had finally got rid of that black-greenish layer from his body; he felt as if he had just stepped out of a sewer. He felt refreshed. However, there was one problem. His physical strength was nowhere close to his past life\u2019s even though his soul had fused with this body. However, the state of his physique, muscles, and bones had improved to a shocking level after the washing-away of so many impurities from his body. His mouth curled into a smile as this thought crossed his mind.The house guards saw their Young Master floating on the water surface from afar; he was neither moving nor sinking. Their eyes were wide open in shock. What kind of divine art was the Young Master practicing? After all, it was impossible for anyone to float on the water\u2019s surface like that. One would need at least a minimum of Jade level Xuan Qi to do that even if one was to utilize his Xuan Qi.Jun Xie finally came out of the pond.\u00a0He felt refreshed, but that feeling was soon overshadowed by a sense of exhaustion. It was a big feat that he hadn\u2019t fainted in the light of the fact that he had just gone through the painful process of Pulp Rending Meridian Cleanser since the original Young Master Jun hadn\u2019t taken good care of his body.He managed to reach his room owing to his strong will. He then changed into a set of white robes. After that, the young Lolita brought in a bowl of bird\u2019s nest soup with a playful smile on her face.One\u2019s priority is always strength; no matter the kind of a world one is in. People can survive without having any influence, but they must never be short of personal strength. Jun Xie had never been so wishful of increasing his strength; not even in his past life.Jun Xie had come into this world alone. So, the only thing that could bring him some peace of mind was strength; a strength so powerful that he could hold the life and death of multitudes of people in his hands.Jun Xie was confident that he was the master of the mysterious pagoda. It was going to be his trump card in this new world. He believed that the secrets present in the mysterious pagoda weren\u2019t limited to the Art of Unlocking Heaven\u2019s Fortune. He was certain that there were other secrets inside it. He would surely know about them in the time to come.His inner conviction was also strengthened since the Art of Unlocking Heaven\u2019s Fortune was proclaimed as the \u2018First Eternal Art\u2019. This meant that it wasn\u2019t an average technique.Jun Xie recalled the practice methods of the first stage of the Art of Unlocking Heaven\u2019s Fortune \u2013 the Great Overflowing Illumination. He then sat down cross-legged on the ground. After that, he entered a peaceful state with his \u2018mind and body as one\u2019, and started to practice the first stage.\u201cIllumination is spread when the divine light is set into movement. Tread upon the Spring of Immortals to Transcend the Nine Heavens. The heart becomes a mountain of treasure when the world is within grasp. A soul that undergoes nine divine refinements may never fall to Hell!\u201dSurprisingly, Jun Xie felt nothing even after he began to practice the method; he couldn\u2019t even feel the slightest bit of Qi. However, he didn\u2019t feel discouraged. He continued to monitor his body to prevent it from relaxing, and started to practice once again.However, there was no reaction even after he had practised the methods to regulate his body over two-hundred times. His meridians had remained inactive from beginning to end. Moreover, his legs had gone numb due to sitting in a cross-legged position for such a long time. It seemed that the capabilities of this body were yet to be developed even though it had gone through the cleaning process. He had even started to feel dizzy; he felt that he could faint anytime.He took another deep breath and cleared his mind. He thought, [I don\u2019t believe that I can\u2019t succeed in forcing out the Qi. I\u2019m a master when it comes to being evil. Who can be more evil than I \u2013 the Evil Monarch? This senior will certainly succeed].Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu[This senior will never fall before other evils. The other evils must fall before me. I\u2019m the Evil Monarch. I\u2019m the Supreme Leader of all evils.]He entered into the state of meditation once again. His muscles started to feel strained and stiff after a while. His body refused to obey him. He regulated his body as per the instructions of the Art of Unlocking Heaven\u2019s fortune more than three-hundred times. But, he felt nothing.Jun Xie closed his eyes in an attempt to suppress his exhaustion. He continued to repeat one thing in his mind, [One more time\u2026 one more time\u2026 one more time\u2026 more\u2026 more\u2026]Jun Xie finally felt a change taking place in the Niwan Palace(1) within his mind after an indefinite period of time. He then felt a little change in his meridians along with a flush of heat. But, it felt very weak and insignificant; one couldn\u2019t feel it unless one monitored every part of the body in a constant manner. The flow of the Qi was thin to the point of being almost non-existent. But, its presence was truly abnormal. It was something rather peculiar. The one to practice internal arts can manage to practice to the point of feeling the flow of Qi. But, it shouldn\u2019t have condensed to become a solid existence that flows within one\u2019s body. However, Jun Xie had lost himself in his practice to the point of absurdity. So, he couldn\u2019t realize it.A seven-hued ray of light rose from the base of a miniature pagoda inside Jun Xie\u2019s consciousness as soon as the flow of Qi appeared. Then, the pagoda started to rotate in the air slowly. A huge amount of white mist was emitted out with each of its rotations. Countless white threads \u2013 invisible to the naked eye \u2013 were formed by the mist around Jun Xie\u2019s body as the white mist slowly floated around. The threads then started to penetrate Jun Xie\u2019s skin \u2013 all the way down to his meridians\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He continued to regulate his body, and practiced; he seemed to be unaware of what had happened.The Art of Unlocking Heaven\u2019s Fortune was very mysterious. It had been the most superior skill since time immemorial. The path of cultivation had always been an act of defying Heaven; if one existed\u2026 It was an art which put a person\u2019s disposition to the test. It was extremely difficult to practice the \u2018beginner\u2019 part of this art to its extreme. One must come across a huge opportunity in addition to possessing perseverance and a strong will power.However, one\u2019s chances of succeeding in practicing the art were extremely low even if one was to come across an opportunity to practice it. A practitioner with a weak heart would give up if he didn\u2019t get any result after practicing the art for hundred times. An ordinary person couldn\u2019t withstand this kind of dullness. A person with a weak spirit couldn\u2019t have endured it. Jun Xie was one of the rare people \u2013 even from a cultivator\u2019s standpoint \u2013 who could repeat this routine for over a thousand times.Even a person with strong perseverance could suffer from the \u2018Devil\u2019s Bite\u2019 or a \u2018Backlash\u2019 if his spiritual awareness wasn\u2019t strong enough.However, Jun Xie possessed the necessary characteristics required to practice this art. He had always been an unyielding man. He would never change his mind once he had set his eyes on a goal. He was a man with strong perseverance if one considered in a positive context. But, even a brain-dead zombie would never turn back unless he hit a wall. However, Jun Xie was one step ahead! He was the king of zombies; he\u2019d keep hitting the wall until it gave way, and would then continue to advance forward without even looking back. The ideal scenario of finding a person appropriate to practice this art was similar to finding a tortoise which had gone out and bumped into a turtle. And as everyone knows\u2026 tortoise and turtle belong to the same family.Jun Xie had the right personality and mind-set to practice this art. Moreover, he was extremely lucky. Coming across the Hongjun Pagoda had turned out to be a blessing for him. He wouldn\u2019t have started to tread on this path if he hadn\u2019t been lucky enough to come across the pagoda.In addition, Jun Xie\u2019s spiritual awareness couldn\u2019t have been weakened since his soul had transmigrated into Jun Mo Xie\u2019s body. Jun Mo Xie\u2019s physical condition had been restored with the help of the Hongjun Pagoda. Moreover, his spiritual awareness had become stronger. These factors had added-up, and had helped Jun Xie to break through the difficult first stage of the art within a single night.This act was unprecedented; it couldn\u2019t be repeated again.The Niwan Palace inside Jun Xie\u2019s mind began to throb. It eventually began to follow a regular pattern. Jun Xie\u2019s fair skin started to become red as it continued to become hotter.It was already the break of the dawn; the sky had started to become clearer. Jun Xie felt that the Qi within his body \u2013 similar to a thread of silk \u2013 was becoming livelier, and was linking together to form a row.Jun Xie felt a brilliant light coming to life in front of him as all the threads finished joining together. The light was filled with colorful speckles. Jun Xie felt as if the flowers of the entire world had bloomed before his eyes. The afterglow of the seven colors revolved around him. Suddenly, thunderous roars and lightning burst forth from his head.However, Jun Xie\u2019s eyes were closed. All this was occurring within his sense of awareness. This was the first hurdle of the art \u2013 Calm Heart.Jun Xie could clearly \u2018see\u2019 the entire atmosphere. However, he remembered that he had closed his eyes since he had started to practice the art. So, he shouldn\u2019t have been able to see this imagery\u2026 but he was able to. This meant that this was nothing more than an illusion.Jun Xie decided to ignore it as this thought crossed his mind. He continued to practice with an indifferent expression on his face.\u2018Boom!\u2019 there was an explosion in Jun Xie\u2019s consciousness \u2013 like a bomb. Suddenly, his body started to convulse. It seemed as if his body had lost something which had once been a part of it. He spat a mouthful of blood as his soul swayed. He then fainted.His blood had fell on the white sheets on the bed. But, it looked like a black solid substance \u2013 like charcoal. It didn\u2019t flow down the bed. Instead, it remained as it was.Jun Xie fell to the ground. However, his body twitched in a continuous manner. Then, a dark liquid started to exude out of the pores of his skin. It drenched his light-colored robe, and changed its color to black.This was the real effect of the Pulp Rending Meridian Cleanser.His body had previously discharged the impurities of the skin and muscles along with that layer of filth. Now, it was discharging the impurities from his skeleton and inner organs. He had already spat out the impurities of the five organs in the form of blood. They were the most difficult part of the human body to cleanse.According to those who cultivate the Way of the Dao \u2014 Jun Xie was going through the \u2018shedding\u2019 process. This meant that he was now free from the bondages of worldly possessions and desires. He had now entered the path of cultivation.The process of \u2018shedding\u2019 was usually preceded by a long and painful experience. Some people spent months, years, and sometimes decades to reach this stage. Some people spent their entire lives, and still couldn\u2019t succeed. However, Jun Xie had been successful in a night\u2019s time. This was similar to a miracle. None of the ascetics would\u2019ve believed this news if it were to spread around.This hadn\u2019t happened because of Jun Xie\u2019s physical form or spiritual power. The white mist was the reason behind this phenomena. The white mist was the purest form of spiritual Qi between the heaven and the earth. However, Jun Xie hadn\u2019t yet realized this fact.Jun Xie had been a martial arts expert in his past life. But, he had never come across this realm of cultivation. He considered the \u2018so-called\u2019 cultivations \u2013 practiced to achieve immortality \u2013 as senseless. Moreover, he would consider it as a stroke of luck even if he was to realize what had happened to his body.Jun Xie woke-up to find himself inside a huge barrel filled with warm water. He realized that a pair of small and soft hands was scrubbing his body.He saw the young maid Ke\u2019er \u2014 the Lolita \u2014 in front of him. Her forehead was covered in sweat; her face had become red from the heat. She was holding a small towel in her hands. She panted as she cleaned his body with it. Her lips were pursed-up tightly. She looked embarrassed; so much so that she seemed to be on the verge of crying. She was constantly looking upwards unless she needed to scrub a different area of his body. Then, she would again continue to look upwards.[The shy expression on this girl\u2019s face looks too cute.] Suddenly, Jun Xie realized that he was stark naked. He coughed twice in embarrassment, and said, \u201cI\u2019ll do it myself.\u201d Then, he reached out for the towel in Ke\u2019er\u2019s hands.She yelped, and ran while still clutching the towel in her hands. There was a trace of panic in her eyes. She trembled as she spoke, \u201cYoung\u2026 young\u2026 young\u2026 Master\u2026 you\u2026 you\u2019re awake?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe sighed helplessly and replied, \u201cWouldn\u2019t you be talking to a ghost if I weren\u2019t awake?\u201d\u201cGhost?! AHH!\u201d she let out another scream. Jun Xie could see the little hair on her face standing up. Her face turned white; as if she had actually seen a ghost. Jun Xie sighed, \u201cStop screaming! Even if there was a ghost\u2026 it wouldn\u2019t have been scarier than you. Your performance is worthy of a big applause.\u201d\u2018Bang!\u2019 Suddenly, the door of his room was burst open. Then, a stalwart figure walked in. \u201cMo Xie, are you awake? What happened?\u201d It was Grandpa Jun. He was accompanied by several bodyguards.Grandpa Jun seemed to be extremely angry. He had just finished lecturing the thirty-six bodyguards assigned to protect his grandson. Yesterday\u2019s incident could be considered as an unfortunate accident. But, how could one guess that it would happen again?\u00a0Grandpa\u2019s Jun temper was almost on the verge of an explosion.\u00a0[What? Does my Jun family look easy pickings to you? Do you think that we can be bullied in this manner? It seems that this Senior will have to display some of his might. How are we going to spend the rest of our days if everyone decides to target my grandson\u2026?]It seemed that Grandpa Jun had assumed that his grandson had fainted due to an attempt on his life!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, he had somehow guessed that the two incidents were related to each other. He had been extremely angry to hear that Jun Mo Xie had jumped into the Setting Moon pond. He had woken-up startled\u2026 with his heart filled with fear. Then, he had received the news that there had been a problem with his grandson. This had ignited his anger further.\u201cI\u2019m alright\u2026 All\u2019s good. I\u2019m fine.\u201d Jun Xie grabbed a towel to hide his crotch in embarrassment. He stood naked in front of several elderly men\u2026 his body had been left vulnerable to everyone\u2019s eyes. Jun Xie was a thick-skinned person with a calm mind. However, he couldn\u2019t accept this.\u201cWhat are you trying to cover-up? Do you need to be so ashamed to show that \u2018thing\u2019 to your grandfather? I still remember the time when you were a baby. I would often carry you in one hand\u2026 while my other hand played around with that thing.\u201d Jun Zhan Tian\u2019s words nearly caused Jun Xie to choke to death.The bodyguards at the back relaxed. But, their faces turned red as they showed restraint. All of them started to breath heavily. Many of them stole glances at the area covered by the Young Master. Some of them winked and signalled each other; as if they were comparing something\u2026\u201cWho was it?\u201d Jun Zhan Tian\u2019s face fell; it looked as cold as ice. It seemed as if his killing intention had been unleashed.\u201cHuh?\u201d Jun Xie was confused. However, he quickly understood what Grandpa Jun meant. He lowered his head in shame and replied, \u201cI fell before I could see anything.\u201d\u201cYou waste of a boy!\u201d Grandpa Jun swore in a voice filled with disappointment. He looked at him once more to ensure that he was fine. After that, he no longer seemed to be in a mood to look at his naked body. His grandson didn\u2019t look like a person from a military family with his small physique. Even a young lady\u2019s skin couldn\u2019t be fairer than his.\u00a0[Humph! This is truly\u2026] Grandpa Jun nodded reluctantly, \u201cYou take rest then.\u201d Then, he turned around and departed with the bodyguards. Jun Xie finally heaved a sigh of relief. He put away the towel as he broke out in a cold sweat.The next day, the Old Duke flew into a temper inside the Golden Imperial Hall. He unleashed a barrage of curses at several lords, ministers, and imperial relatives. He didn\u2019t even spare the Chief Chancellor. He seemed to be exceptionally agitated. He warned that every family would lose one of its members if another attempt was made on his only grandson\u2019s life.Jun Zhan Tian had been silent since the past few years. Therefore, his sudden eruption rendered the entire royal court \u2013 including both the civil and military factions \u2013 into silence. So, the Emperor had to comfort him in person.However, there were a few insensitive people present in the court. The Eldest Prince\u2019s old supporter \u2013 the Royal Doctor Song Shi Yi \u2013 was a newly promoted noble. He had climbed to this position with the help of the Eldest Prince. However, he didn\u2019t know much about this Old Duke. He contradicted Jun Zhan Tian with an expectation to be supported by the Elder Prince in order to get the Emperor\u2019s support. But, he was bashed by Jun Zhan Tian, and ended-up losing two of his teeth. He was left to look like a pig as a result.The Eldest Prince came forward to persuade Jun Zhan Tian. But, he went rolling on the floor after he received a kick from Jun Zhan Tian on his stomach. After that, no one even dared to move. This prompted the Emperor to come forward and pacify the Old Duke. He reassured him that he would personally guarantee Third Young Master Jun\u2019s safety. Finally, Jun Zhan Tian decided to leave with an indignant face. However, he stared furiously at all the supporters of the Prince before he left; the legs of the supporters had turned as unsteady as noodles\u2026The Old Duke had held back his anger for almost ten years. So, every official of the Golden Imperial Hall was terrified out of their wits when Jun Zhan Tian had thrown a fit. He had even dared to strike the Prince. What else would he not do?The Emperor looked at the departing figure of Jun Zhan Tian. He was the only one who could let out a deep sigh. Jun Zhan Tian had displayed an imposing might and prestige in the court. However, the Emperor was also aware that the Old Duke was disappointed with his only grandson. He remembered the time when Jun Zhan Tian had come to him with a proposal of Jun Mo Xie\u2019s marriage with Princess Ling Meng. That was probably the last attempt on Jun Zhan Tian\u2019s part to preserve his bloodline.However, His Majesty had rejected the proposal.Jun Zhan Tian would never throw such a fit in the Golden Imperial Hall as long as Jun Mo Xie was alive. He had lost his temper owing to the fact that he couldn\u2019t see a future for the Jun family. The Jun family had countless enemies \u2013 both inside and outside. So, the Old Duke knew that his grandson won\u2019t be spared after he died\u2026Therefore, the Old Duke had felt no reservations before he had lost his temper,\u00a0[I\u2019ll finish whoever tries to hurt my Jun family or my grandson. My family has already been forced to such a degree. What else is there to fear?]The Jun family was once the awe-inspiring Saint Patron of the Tian Xiang Kingdom. Could they decline into oblivion like this? The Emperor let out a sigh as a feeling of regret tugged at his heart. Perhaps back then\u2026The military officials were frightened after they witnessed the Old Duke\u2019s might. A few people had made plans against him in the past. They obviously dropped their plans as soon as they saw the Old Duke\u2019s temper. Even the Eldest Prince didn\u2019t hold anything against Jun Zhan Tian even though he had been hit by him. Instead, he blamed his old supporter for whatever had happened. Was he blind to not notice the anger and madness of the Old Duke?However, there were many people who had grievances in their hearts.\u00a0[You old thing, do you think that you\u2019ll continue to live forever? The Jun family will become extinct the day you die!]However, they could only think along these lines. No one in the Tian Xing Kingdom had the courage to confront the Old Duke.Only\u2026The Royal Preceptor Chief Chancellor Li Shang had been silent throughout the proceedings.\u00a0He smiled and raised his eyebrows after Jun Zhan Tian had left. The Old Duke seemed to be quite protective of his useless grandson. So, was Jun Mo Xie Jun Zhan Tian\u2019s weakness? It was easy to determine this kind of a weakness. A person couldn\u2019t be feared if his weakness was revealed\u2026 even if he was immensely strong.The Palace Army Captain \u2013 Meng Ru Fei \u2014 stood in a corner beside Preceptor Li. He looked at him with a smile on his face.Jun Family House\u2026 Jun Xie\u2019s Room\u2026The doors were closed. Little Ke\u2019s face was red with embarrassment. She seemed keen to escape.\u201cAre you scared of me?\u201d Jun Xie cleaned his naked body. This made no difference to him since the girl had already seen him naked. Why would he care if the little girl did again?\u201cScared\u2026\u201d Little Ke nodded her head. But then, she thought something and quickly said, \u201cNo\u2026 no\u2026 not\u2026 scared.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euJun Xie laughed and got out of the bathtub; he was still naked. Little Ke covered her eyes and screamed.Jun Xie quickly put on his clothes. He then spoke with a smile, \u201cYou can open your eyes now\u2026 it\u2019s alright.\u201dLittle Ke secretly peeked from a crack between her fingers. She felt calm when she saw that Jun Xie was now clothed. She then put her hands down. Her face was still a little red; she looked truly lovely.Jun Xie saw her cute face. He couldn\u2019t help and reached out to gently pat her head. Little Ke was surprised. She raised her head and saw that Jun Xie\u2019s eyes were filled with warmth. He seemed to be like a big brother looking at his little sister. She started to feel serene; she was no longer fearful. She thought, [Right now\u2026 the Young Master looks pleasing to the eye.]Suddenly, she was startled, [How can I even think that? He\u2019s still the indecent, defiled, and abhorrent baddie! I\u2019ll not allow him to defile my innocence. I\u2019ll give my life if he uses force.] Her face became alert, and she took a step backwards.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He knew the world and its innumerable hardships. Therefore, he easily understood the thoughts of the little girl who stood in front of him. He moaned as he pondered over the disappointing state of the first owner of this body; he was so useless that even his young servant was scared of him. He sighed and said, \u201cYour work here is done\u2026 You can go now.\u201dLittle Ke bowed to him and left the room. She thought, [You\u2019ll not be able to harm me as long as I stay away from you. Moreover, you\u2019ll not be able to catch me with your weak body.]Jun Xie went to the window and took a deep breath. He then willed his Qi in order to check the current state of his body.Jun Xie had observed a change in himself from the moment he had woken up. However, he hadn\u2019t had the time to make a thorough analysis of the situation. So, he was surprised to notice the changes in himself. He noticed that he could see at a much farther distance than before. In fact, he could even see what was happening at a distance of thirty feet. He could even count the number of the legs of the tiny insect crawling on the floor. The entire world had transformed in front of his eyes. He saw the trees and grass as lush green and full of vitality.Jun Xie didn\u2019t feel a sting in his eyes as he raised his head to look at the sun for a prolonged period of time. The sun felt to him like a ball of warmth; nothing more.Jun Xie noticed that there was also an improvement in his hearing abilities. Now, he could hear even the faintest sounds made by the bugs rushing about in the grass and the earthworms wriggling on the ground. He had truly started to see the beauty of the world. The world had become alluring to him all of a sudden.Jun Xie had only had such a feeling in his past life when his cultivation in internal arts had broken through into the pre-celestial stage. Still, it hadn\u2019t enveloped his entire body. Jun Xie was a transcendent born from Heaven and earth. He felt elated, [Can it be possible that I\u2019ve attained the pre-celestial stage with only a night\u2019s practice? Isn\u2019t it too fast?] However, he was disappointed to see the flow of Qi within his body.The flow of Qi within his body had become lucid. However, it was still weak. Such a Qi could only be used to cut vegetables; it certainly couldn\u2019t be used in real fights. His Qi wouldn\u2019t have been so weak if he had stepped into the pre-celestial stage.How could his body perform at such \u2018high-specs\u2019 if he hadn\u2019t stepped into the pre-celestial stage\u2026? Jun Xie guessed that it could\u2019ve happened owing to the Art of Unlocking Heaven\u2019s Fortune. His spirits were lifted as this thought crossed his mind.Jun Xie felt stunned as he rolled-up his sleeves. Could his body be considered as that of a man\u2019s? He had delicate snow-white arms with a tinge of pink. His arms could put a woman to shame. His heart fell apart as he saw himself in the bronze mirror. His facial features looked the same. However, his face had become tenderer than before. Jun Xie loathed these kind of faces. It was the face of a flowery boy. It belonged to a flowery boy with a milky-white skin and frail-looking body.Jun Xie felt as if he had seen a ghost. He laughed and muttered, [When I came into this world\u2026 my situation was similar to a person who had seen a ghost. I\u2019ll not be surprised if something even stranger happens\u2026]He had a session of the Pulp Rending Meridian Cleanser the previous night. In fact, he might even have opened a slight gap in the \u2018doors\u2019 of the Art of Unlocking Heaven\u2019s Fortune. Then, how could his body be so feeble?Jun Xie re-examined his body with these factors in mind. He was surprised to notice that his muscles and flesh had reorganized to become denser and tougher; even though his exterior looked frail. Even the structure of his body in his past life looked less powerful than its present state. The quality of his body \u2013 including the skeleton frames and meridians \u2013 had reached an extremely high stage. His present body could be described as blessed; it seemed to be the best body to practice martial arts.No one could guess that the owner of this seemingly frail body could be an ace assassin. So, it was a natural camouflage for Jun Xie.Jun Xie started to feel even more passionate towards his training as these thoughts crossed his mind. He felt a desire to regain his original strength as fast as possible.Something unthinkable happened in the Jun residence during the next month \u2013 the well-known debauchee Jun Mo Xie stayed inside his home for a month. He didn\u2019t go out for his hooligan pursuits, or to visit the Flowery Night Lodge, or for cockfighting and hound-racing; not even for arson and murder. Instead, he spent his time in his room, or the library! What was most surprising was that he didn\u2019t even try to take liberty with the maids.In fact, he had become polite towards the servants.Everyone in the Jun household found these occurrences strange. They felt as if the Sun had risen from the west or north or south. It seemed obvious that the Sun hadn\u2019t risen from the east in the light of their current circumstances.[Gracious Dear Heavens above! Gracious Great Earth! You\u2019ve at last opened your eyes to favor us\u2026 The Third Young Master is finally showing signs towards becoming a better person.]Even Grandpa Jun was relieved to see this. He felt that Jun Mo Xie was finally making efforts in the direction of the betterment of his personality.Jun Xie was finally successful in reaching the first stage of the Art of Unlocking Heaven\u2019s Fortune. He had also managed to stabilize his cultivation up to an extent. Moreover, he had gathered decent knowledge about the Xuan Xuan Continent. His knowledge about the continent wasn\u2019t at par with any historian, but he could be considered a scholar if his knowledge was to be compared with that of the original Jun Mo Xie\u2019s. In fact, Jun Xie and the original Jun Mo Xie were as different as Heaven and earth.However, Jun Xie wasn\u2019t satisfied about the seven-colored nine-layered pagoda within his consciousness. He was still at its first layer even after a month of hard work. He had been putting himself to test in order to breach its second layer. But, he always ended-up suffering a great deal of pain whenever he tried to test the progress within himself. The pain he felt was equivalent to getting stuck by ten million long needles.This caused an even stronger urge within Jun Xie to reach the second layer. The first layer had provided him with the incredible Art of Unlocking Heaven\u2019s Fortune. So, he was sure that the second and the third layer had better offerings in store. However, the access was still denied to him.Jun Xie wasn\u2019t sure what he could do to make the situation better.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe kept on trying, but to no avail. Even a person of Jun Xie\u2019s perseverance finally decided to give-up. He had seemingly made peace with the fact that he couldn\u2019t reach the second layer by ordinary means. He believed that an appropriate opportunity would itself arise for him to walk into the second layer; like it had been in the case of the first stage. It would be futile for him to continue trying until a suitable opportunity arrived. So, he decided to continue practicing the art. After all, the number of attempts didn\u2019t make any difference.Meanwhile, Jun Xie\u2019s knowledge regarding the Xuan Qi passed on by the Jun family had increased incredibly. He realized that his present Xuan Qi and internal strength was almost similar to that in his past life. It could be said that these two Qi Art existed between the two different classifications. However, a qualitative change occurred and triggered a transformation in the color of Qi whenever a Xuan Qi practitioner made a breakthrough. This reminded Jun Xie of the Five Poisons Art that he had encountered in his past life. But, Xuan Qi didn\u2019t contain any poison.Jun Xie practiced the Art of Unlocking Heaven\u2019s Fortune. So, he looked down upon the so-called Xuan Qi. But, he had decided to train in Xuan Qi in order to deceive the public. He managed to reach the fourth level of Xuan Qi, and decided to stop there.Xuan Qi ranged from first to ninth levels in Xuan Xuan Continent. It was followed by Silver Xuan, Gold Xuan, Jade Xuan, Earth Xuan, Sky Xuan and Spirit Xuan. The first to third levels were marked by the colors light-red, pink-red and thick-red. The fourth to the sixth levels were marked by the colors light-purple, stable-purple and thick-purple. The seventh to the ninth levels were marked by colors purple-black, grey-black and dark-black. The Silver level was marked by the color silver, and the Gold by the golden color. The Jade level was marked by the green color, and the Earth rank by yellow color. The Sky rank was marked by blue color. However, the Spirit Xuan rank was colorless.It was extremely difficult to advance through each of the stages of Xuan Qi as one had to go through a great deal of pain. It was quite similar to that of internal strength practice of scouring the marrow.\u00a0Jun Xie could only emit a light purple color of the Fourth level Xuan Qi in his present state. It was a meager outcome when the status of his advancement was kept in view.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Little Ke feared him less these days \u2013 due to his changed behavior in the past few days. She was still fearful of going too close to him. However, she didn\u2019t abhor him much; especially his story-telling. The girl would carry an incense pot in Jun Xie\u2019s room at the same hour every day, and would listen to his stories attentively. She would blink her eyes as she sat in front of Jun Xie. She followed the characters and emotions of each of the stories. She cheered, laughed, and cried with the characters. And, she felt excited when a handsome prince arrived in the story.Jun Xie once told her the unfortunate story of the little mermaid. The little girl was so moved that she burst into tears. In fact, she cried for an entire day. Jun Xie swore to himself that he would never tell tragic stories to women again.Those tears\u2026 could drown a person to death!One day, Jun Xie was narrating the story of the monkey Sun being captured in the Eight Diagrams Furnace to Little Ke. Little Ke held an incense pot in her hands, and stood in front of him. She kept on blinking her eyes while she listened to the story. Suddenly, a bodyguard rushed inside and said, \u201cYoung Master, Young Master Tang has arrived.\u201d\u201cYoung Master Tang?\u201d Jun Xie raised his head in confusion. He then searched for the memories related to this person in his head. He then said, \u201cSend him in.\u201dA meatball started to roll towards him from the courtyard. It shouted as it continued to roll, \u201cThird Young Master, Brother Mo Xie, please save me! I\u2019m stuck with a horrible problem\u2026\u201dJun Xie was astounded to see a meatball talk. He eventually understood that it was a man as it came near him.This person didn\u2019t seem to have a neck; at least Jun Xie couldn\u2019t see one. He had wide shoulders, short and thick arms and thighs, and a round head. The layers of fat in his body moved up and down in the air as he ran; they looked like the raging waves of the Yangtze River. He could be described as an opposite of a bamboo stalk. He didn\u2019t look like a human from any angle.He walked in from the door of the courtyard. He kept on wiping his sweat; even though he had only walked a few steps. He seemed extremely tired. This person was the Young Master of the Tang family. His name was Tang Yuan. The status of this Tang family was at par with the Jun family.Jun Xie thought, [He does look like him\u2026 but he looks bigger than before.]\u201cUh\u2026 Young Master Tang\u2026 What\u2019s wrong with you? Why are you screaming for me to save you? Who provoked you this time?\u201d Jun Xie held back his laughter as he looked at Jun Mo Xie\u2019s best friend.Young Master Tang looked angry, \u201cBloody grannies! Who else but those slops from the Li and Meng families\u2026?!\u201d He tried to open his eyes in between the thick flesh of his face, and succeeded in opening two narrow slits. He continued, \u201cBrother, I was in the Thousand Gold Hall from the past ten days. I\u2019ve lost hundred-and-fifty-thousand silver liangs! Third Young Master, please help me! Otherwise, my old man will beat me to death\u2026\u201dJun Xie was stunned, \u201cHundred-and-fifty-thousand silver liangs! How could you lose you so much money? In fact, from where did you get so much money?\u201dTang Yuan heaved a deep sigh, \u201cI was winning at first. I had won around fifty-thousand\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy did you continue to play if they weren\u2019t letting you win after that? What were you playing to lose so much money for? You\u2019ve got some guts\u2026\u201d Jun Xie stared at him and asked.Tang Yuan didn\u2019t dare to counter Jun Xie\u2019s point. Instead, he grumbled, \u201cDidn\u2019t you lose hundred-thousand liangs last month? I\u2019ve only lost a little higher amount than yours\u2026 and you\u2019re\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy are you telling me all these things? Can\u2019t your Tang family afford to pay hundred-and-fifty-thousand liangs for you? Why did you come here yelling?\u201d Jun Xie realized that these kind of people couldn\u2019t be judged on the basis of common sense. These people were the typical spend-thrift Young Masters.\u201cWould your own father kill you for an amount of hundred-and-fifty-thousand silver liangs? It\u2019s not that you haven\u2019t lost such an amount of money before\u2026\u201d\u201cAfter I lost all my money\u2026 I told them that I\u2019ll go home to get some more. Then, Li Bo started to provoke me. He said that everyone was tired\u2026 and that they would go away if I didn\u2019t stay there. I became angry\u2026 and\u2026\u201d Tang Yuan looked at Jun Xie with a face filled with regret.Suddenly, Jun Xie started to feel apprehensive, \u201cAnd\u2026 what?\u201d\u201cOne can lose his people\u2026 but not his face. I pawned my precious jade and sword for three-hundred-thousand silver liangs in an impulsive fit. I thought that I would win all my money back. But, I didn\u2019t expect\u2026 didn\u2019t expect\u2026 that I would lose it all,\u201d Tang Yuan said in a hesitant manner.\u201cYou said that one can lose his people\u2026 but not face. I remember that your father spent a huge amount of money to buy the famed Snow Buster Sword for you. That divine weapon can cut iron like mud. That jade was made-up of Warm Jade. Your father had paid one-million liangs to buy those assets for you. And yet\u2026 you pawned them for only a three-hundred-thousand liangs? No one can make this kind of a loss in a bargain sale\u2026\u201dJun Xie was speechless. [This man is a complete rake!]\u201cI too have rules\u2026 you know\u2026 but, my mind had become numb. I can\u2019t even explain the state of my mind back then,\u201d Tang Yuan grumbled.\u201cYou still have the pledge note\u2026 even if you\u2019ve lost your possessions. So, you can redeem your assets later on. I know that your father loves you a lot. He\u2026 at the most\u2026 will rebuke you. He won\u2019t kill you over this. Moreover, your family has a lot of money. Is this such a serious problem\u2026?\u201d Jun Xie grunted twice.\u201cNonsense! These two items are treasures. How can I not wish to win them back?\u201d Tang Yuan replied in an indignant manner. \u201cBut, you\u2019re well aware of my Grandpa\u2019s rules. You saw it yourself\u2026 what I had to endure the last time. One layer of my skin had been torn-off because of his beating!\u201d\u201cAnd yet\u2026 you continued to gamble. What did you pawn this time? I know that you possess a lot of precious assets. But, you don\u2019t have anything else that was worth a million liangs\u2026\u201d Jun Xie was an experienced man when it came to the psychology related to gambling. He knew that this fat friend of Jun Mo Xie wouldn\u2019t have been this anxious if he hadn\u2019t gambled away something he couldn\u2019t recover.\u201cYes\u2026 Actually\u2026 I didn\u2019t have anything valuable on me. So, I pawned my wife\u2026\u201d Tang Yuan\u2019s face looked full of regret and a desire to end his life. \u201cI\u2019m not even married to her yet.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Little Ke gasped and widened her eyes in shock. She stared at Tang Yuan with disgust in her eyes. She thought in her heart, [It was difficult enough for the Young Master to become a better human being\u2026 and now this friend of his has arrived.]\u201cWhat? You pawned your wife? You pulled your wife into this mess?\u201d Jun Xie nearly tumbled-off his chair. He felt that he would faint. This was too shocking! It was unthinkable!Tang Yuan\u2019s fianc\u00e9e was the daughter of Sun Cheng He \u2013 the Vice-Minister of the Ministry of Justice. A beauty from a prestigious family had been dragged into the Thousand Gold Hall. This news would attract an unsurmountable amount of ridicule and laughter if it was to spread.[The son of the Minister of State Revenue went gambling\u2026 and lost the daughter of the Vice-Minister of Justice in a bet.] Grandpa Tang would pump-out all the fat and oil from this fatty\u2019s body and use it as a fuel for the Sky Lantern if he came to know of this.\u201cI\u2026 I didn\u2019t drag her there\u2026 \u201d Tang Yuan was on the verge of crying, \u201c\u2026 but I signed a promissory note\u2026 pawning her for a million liangs\u2026 It was written in black and white. I signed it.\u201d\u201cPig\u2026 you pig!\u201d She was the daughter of the Vice-Minister of justice\u2026 and Tang Yuan was the son of the Minister of State Revenue. This incident had the capacity to affect the future and reputation of the two prestigious families. And yet, he had pawned his to-be-wife for a mere one-million liangs. \u201cYou signed it as well! What happened to the one-million liangs?\u201d\u201cI lost them too\u2026\u201d Tang Yuan fell to ground, and started to bawl and wail. This caused the ground to tremble a little. \u201cThey said that they don\u2019t need the money or my fianc\u00e9e. But, they will make the promissory note public if I don\u2019t give them around a million-and-five-hundred-thousand liangs within three hours.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cOh My God!\u201d Jun Xie was speechless. \u201cHow did it become one million-and- five-hundred-thousand liangs? Wasn\u2019t it supposed to be only a million liangs?\u201cThe extra money is the price for granting me three hours to get the money. Please save me, Third Young Master. I\u2019ve nowhere else to go.\u201d\u201cHow can I save you? What made you think that I\u2019ve such an amount of money?\u201d Jun Xie said. [Are you serious? I can happily kill a person like you\u2026 and you\u2019re expecting me to help a gambler like yourself? That\u2019s another matter that I don\u2019t have this much money with me. But, even if I had this sum of money\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t have lent it to you.]\u201cI don\u2019t need money from you\u2026\u201d Tang Yun\u2019s spirits were lifted. He blinked his small eyes and said, \u201cYou haven\u2019t visited the Thousand Gold Hall in the recent times. So, Li Feng and Meng Hai Zhou have put forward a condition that they\u2019ll return the promissory note to me if I can bring you to gamble a few rounds with them.\u201d\u201cDo I have such a high level of prestige?\u201d Jun Xie shook his head as he thought about the wasteful ways of the original owner of this body. His fame in the gambling halls had transcended all notions of popularity!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Jun Xie felt as if his arm had been wrapped in a layer of oil. \u201cThey promised that they\u2019ll hand over the promissory note to me as soon as the Third Young Master enters the Thousand Gold Hall. They\u2019ll not pursue this matter any further.\u201d\u201cOh! Did they say that?\u201d Jun Xie frowned. His eyes flickered as he gave it a thought. Something felt wrong about the whole situation. This discussion was supposed to be about Tang Yuan losing his wife in a bet. How did he end-up becoming a part of it? Some kind of a foul game seemed to be involved in the situation. Was he the target of a conspiracy?Jun Xie was sure that it was a set-up.The original Jun Mo Xie was an idiot. His temper would\u2019ve blown on hearing about how his brother was bullied. He would\u2019ve been excited on hearing about how his opponents were giving him such an importance. His presumptuous nature would\u2019ve led him straight into the trap set-up by his enemies.If a trap had truly been laid\u2026 then the enemies had full knowledge of Jun Mo Xie\u2019s character.But, why would someone lay such a detailed trap for a useless person like Jun Mo Xie? This conspiracy was probably meant for Grandpa Jun. It was possible that there was another mastermind behind these people. After all, ordinary people like them wouldn\u2019t dare to provoke Grandpa Jun.Jun Xie looked at Tang Yuan as he tried to figure out his role in the conspiracy. [Is he a friend or an enemy?] He noticed Tang Yuan\u2019s fearful expressions. [This fatty is an absolute patsy if he isn\u2019t pretending. And, he\u2019s a great actor if he\u2019s pretending to be afraid. In fact, in that case\u2026 he\u2019s truly an extremely dangerous person\u2026 whose real face is hidden behind a mask of fear.]Jun Xie started to wonder if he should or shouldn\u2019t go to the Thousand Gold Hall.However, he reached a decision within a few seconds. He decided that he wouldn\u2019t miss out on such an exciting event. Why would he fear about losing with his gambling skills? Moreover, he wouldn\u2019t find out the identity of his enemies if he didn\u2019t go. Jun Xie didn\u2019t believe in letting his enemies plot behind his back. He believed in revealing their identities and killing them.Jun Xie smiled as he secretly circulated the divine Art of Unlocking Heaven\u2019s Fortune. [I\u2019ll not lose even if they\u2019re great gamblers. It\u2019s too easy for me to cheat with this kind of an internal energy at my disposal.]Jun Xie seemed to have made-up his mind. He turned around and asked Little Ke, \u201cHow many silver bills do we have?\u201dLittle Ke felt both joyous and shameful as she heard the word \u2018we\u2019 in Jun Xie\u2019s question. Her heart was filled with sweet emotions. She blushed and replied, \u201cIf we subtract the money which the Old Master deducted last time\u2026 the silver box holds a hundred-and-twenty-thousand liang silver bills, thirty-thousand liang gold bills, three-hundred liang gold leafs, one-hundred ingots white silver, fragment silver\u2026\u201d\u201cEnough\u2026 that\u2019s enough\u2026 I\u2019ll not be using so much money\u2026\u201d Jun Xie stopped Little Ke as she continued to report Jun Mo Xie\u2019s wealth in detail. She would\u2019ve even stated the number of copper coins in Jun Mo Xie\u2019s possession if she hadn\u2019t been stopped.\u201cGet fifty-thousand silver liang bills\u2026 and arrange a dozen pieces of fragment silver,\u201d Jun Xie said.Tang Yuan jumped-up. He cried, \u201cThis amount is very less. It won\u2019t be enough. Brother, Third Young Master, this amount won\u2019t cover even a fraction of my debt. Are you trying to send me to my death? I\u2019m begging you\u2026\u201d\u201cBrother Tang, didn\u2019t you say that the promissory note will be returned to you as soon as I enter the Thousand Gold Hall? I\u2019m going there to gamble\u2026 not to give them money. Why do you want me to take so much money with me? Wouldn\u2019t it become taxing for me? Don\u2019t you have faith in my unmatched gambling skills?\u201d Jun Xie replied.\u201cYour unmatched gambling skills\u2026?!\u201d Tang Yuan\u2019s foolish eyes became round in surprise. This wasn\u2019t an ordinary feat for him. His mouth twitched. He would\u2019ve burst out laughing if his mind wasn\u2019t filled with dread and fear. He mumbled to himself, [I never happened to see you winning with your unmatched gambling skills. You\u2019re skills are certainly unmatched\u2026 but they\u2019re probably your losing skills.][It doesn\u2019t matter. Everything will be fine as long as you come with me. I won\u2019t be fearful of anything\u2026 as long as I get the promissory note. Son of a bit*h! How could I lose my mind as far as pawning my own wife? This is really a strange matter. In fact, it\u2019s wise to take less money. At least\u2026 the losses will be limited in that case.]Jun Xie kept the bills in his clothes. He then commanded to prepare a couple of horses. Tang Yuan had become extremely impatient and frightened. He rotated his small eyes as he rolled all the way to the door. \u201cThird Young Master, please hurry up. Everything will be over if we bump into your grandpa. You\u2019ve no idea how much pressure I\u2019ve to go through\u2026 whenever I come to visit you\u2026\u201d Tang Yuan sighed.Jun Xie laughed as he mounted his horse, \u201cBut today\u2026 you don\u2019t seem to be scared.\u201dTang Yuan\u2019s horse neighed and trembled as he mounted it. Its hooves were almost bent to the ground. It could only stand-up after it had put-in a lot of effort. The horse seemed to be wondering, [I\u2019ve carried a large number of people in the past. I\u2019ve ran while carrying generals along with their armors. But, why can\u2019t I carry this person? I can lose my front hoof with a slight miscalculation.]Jun Xie couldn\u2019t help but laugh out loud. He then started to ride his horse. Eight bodyguards with sturdy physiques followed him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euTang Yuan\u2019s horse also started to move with great difficulty. It neighed loudly as it caught-up with Jun Xie.They finally arrived at the Easterly Wind Street; it was the most extravagant street in the entire Tian Xiang city. The street was filled with people, and was bustling with activities. Tang Yuan took the lead without any consideration of the state of his horse. He kept on looking back with a worried expression on his face. He seemed concerned since Jun Xie was moving a bit too slow.A restaurant named Thousand Miles Fragrance Restaurant was located on the north after crossing the Easterly Wind Street. It belonged to the Li family. There was a huge unused courtyard behind the restaurant. This was the place which was known as the Thousand Gold Hall. This was the place where the Young Masters of noble families spent huge amounts of money. There was no limit on betting in this place. One could bet whatever one wanted.Jun Xie was about to enter the place when a few people appeared from the side of the road. They seemed to be following a young woman. The woman shouted as she advanced forward, \u201cStop following me! You\u2019re irritating me to death.\u201d One of the fellows was trying to persuade her while following her. Eight bodyguards were closely following behind them. The woman seemed to belong to a wealthy family.Jun Xie looked at the young woman. She seemed to be pouting. However, she was good-looking. Suddenly, the angry woman\u2019s eyes fell on Jun Xie as he was in the midst of staring her. She shouted, \u201cYou lecher! What are you looking at?\u201d The young woman had decided to take out her anger on the notorious playboy Jun Mo Xie.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was startled. He had also been wandering around the main street in his past life when he had seen \u2018her\u2019. She was so beautiful that he had to turn around to take a second glance at her. That young woman had also been angry. She had also shouted at him, \u201cWhat are you staring at? You rascal, haven\u2019t you seen a beautiful woman before?\u201d Who knew that they would become acquaintances in the future? Jun Xie was an ace assassin. Therefore, he always made sure to avoid as many troubles as possible. Now, both of them had been separated by two worlds. Jun Xie started to feel melancholic as this thought crossed his mind.Jun Xie felt warm in his heart since this young woman had reminded him of his past life. He said, \u201cYou look familiar. Have we met before?\u201dThe young woman clenched her teeth in frustration. She glared at Jun Xie and said, \u201cYou useless person! I know who you are. Third Younger Master, what new tricks do you have up your sleeve? Are you playing the game of the first encounter?\u201d[Eh\u2026 So, I do know her.] Jun Xie started to search for memories related to this woman in his mind. He then laughed and spoke in an embarrassed tone, \u201cMiss Dugu, it\u2019s our fate that we know each other.\u201d[This is fate? What kind of a madness is this?]Miss Dugu was dumbfounded. She stared at Jun Xie with dismayed eyes. One of her female bodyguards couldn\u2019t control her laughter, and burst out laughing. In the meantime, Tang Yuan had returned to locate Jun Xie after having noticed his absence behind him. He too had heard Jun Xie\u2019s words. He couldn\u2019t help but admire him. Third Master Jun was truly a professional when it came to courting women. Moreover, his guts were worthy of being praised. Not many people could dare to speak in such a manner in front of the most irrational woman of the Tian Xiang kingdom.Dugu Xiao Yi stared at Jun Xie with fierce eyes. She then said, \u201cHave you forgotten the last beating that you received from me? As you can see\u2026 I\u2019m already not in a fine mood today. I can help you in getting rid of your bones\u2026 if you want.\u201dJun Xie was startled. He finally recalled that this woman \u2013 Dugu Xiao Yi was the biggest terror in Jun Mo Xie\u2019s life. He had been beaten-up by this woman in the past because of some action of his\u2019. The beating had been so severe that it had taken him nearly a fortnight to get off his bed.\u201cMiss Dugu, I hope you\u2019re doing fine. Aaahhhh\u2026 I wanted to say that this Little Brother has some important matter to take care of. So, I\u2019ll take my leave. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d Jun Xie tried to leave the place as soon as possible. The young lady seemed as if she was about to pounce on him and give him a good beating. According to Jun Xie\u2019s memories, the young woman had great fighting abilities even though she was extremely young. She could easily defeat not one\u2026 but several Jun Mo Xies with her skills. Jun Xie wasn\u2019t scared of her. But, it was important for him to conceal his true strength at this point of time. Moreover, he believed in playing safe. [Errr\u2026. Good guys don\u2019t beat-up women.]\u201cStop!\u201d Dugu Xiao Yi held her head high, and looked at Jun Xie in an arrogant manner. \u201cWhere are you going? Are you planning any mischief? You\u2019ve bumped into me. So, you can forget about your mischievous plans. Come here\u2026 Let me vent out my anger on you. Then, I\u2019ll let you go.\u201dTang Yuan was perspiring like a pig. He stomped his feet and thought, [Third Young Master, people change their paths rather than coming face-to-face with this woman. Why did you have to provoke her? It\u2019s true that she\u2019s beautiful. But, she\u2019s isn\u2019t as important as your life.]An idea crossed Jun Xie\u2019s mind as he looked at the arrogant face of the woman standing in front of him. He whispered in a secretive tone, \u201cMiss Dugu, it\u2019s inappropriate for girls to visit the place that we\u2019re going to\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat? Are you going to a brothel?\u201d Dugu Xiao Yi had spoken these words without any hesitation. She was clearly an extremely bold woman.She let out a cold sigh as she stared at the two men with contempt in her eyes, \u201cYou filthy people!\u201dJun Xie pretended as if he was shocked. His face looked as if he had been wronged. He said, \u201cWho said that we\u2019re going to a brothel? Not everyone\u2019s like you.\u201d He continued, \u201cWe\u2019re going to the Thousand Gold Hall\u2026 to gamble. Eh?\u201d Suddenly, he realized that he had spoken too much. So, he quickly shut his mouth.\u201cGoing to Thousand Gold Hall for gambling?\u201d Dugu Xiao Yi lost her temper as she heard the first part of Jun Xie\u2019s reply. However, her eyes lit-up as she heard the latter part. She squinted her eyes and smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve never been there\u2026 Will you take me with you?\u201d She had spoken these words in a dominating voice; which hadn\u2019t left any room for a refusal from Jun Xie\u2019s side. The way that woman had jumped from one thought to the other was really admirable.\u201cMiss\u2026\u201d One of Dugu Xiao Yi\u2019s female bodyguards tugged at her sleeve in an attempt to discourage her. She couldn\u2019t be blamed for trying to stop Miss Dugu from visiting a place where two of the most notorious men of the Tian Xiang city were headed. She was the most prized person of her family. How could she hang out with two hooligans like them?However, Dugu Xiao Yi didn\u2019t seem to care about anything. She said in an excited manner, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. These two brothers of mine never get tired of talking about the Thousand Gold Hall. So, there should be something special about that place. Why shouldn\u2019t I go and check it out myself?\u201d She then grabbed Jun Xie\u2019s ear and said, \u201cTake me there\u2026 I\u2019ll let you go then.\u201dJun Xie let her hold his ear even though he could\u2019ve easily avoided her. He pretended that he was going through a lot of pain as she kept on holding his ear while moving forward.Jun Xie\u2019s bodyguards looked at each other and smiled bitterly. Then, they started to follow them. Dugu Xiao Yi\u2019s bodyguards also followed them as they didn\u2019t seem to have any other choice. All the sixteen bodyguards had been stuck in the same situation. No one among them was in a position to do anything but restrain themselves. Jun Xie\u2019s bodyguards were blaming the Dugu family, and vice versa.Tang Yuan sighed. He thought, [How did we manage to cross our paths with a tigress? If she sees the promissory note\u2026] he shivered, [\u2026 then she\u2019ll spread this news in the entire city within a span of few hours. All the important people in the kingdom will come to know about it within two days. Then, I\u2019ll be left with no other choice\u2026 but to end my life on my own.]Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThey finally arrived at the Thousand Mile Fragrance Restaurant. They crossed the outer courtyard, and then entered the huge courtyard at the back of the restaurant. Tang Yuan quickly rushed inside and shouted, \u201cThird Young Master Jun is here. Give it to me quickly\u2026 Give it to me\u2026\u201dSix youngsters appeared at the doorway; all of them were laughing. They were about to say something when they noticed Dugu Xiao Yi approach them while holding Jun Mo Xie\u2019s ear. Their expressions changed, and their faces became as pale as the earth.Only two families were neutral regarding the princes\u2019 fight over the throne. One was the Jun family, and the other was the Dugu family. Both these families held an important position in the court and military circles.Dugu Xiao Yi was the only daughter of the Dugu family. She had seven brothers. She had been greatly pampered as she was the only daughter of the family. So, she had become spoilt and conceited. However, she was extremely skilled. Her level of cultivation in Xuan Qi had reached a superior level even though she was very young. Moreover, she was blessed with a great sense of justice. She was famous throughout Tian Xiang city, and was known as the \u2018Nemesis of Debauchees\u2019. All the Young Masters present in the Thousand Gold Hall had had a bitter experience with her in the past.It was believed that her grandfather \u2013 Dugu Zongheng \u2014 was an efficient Xuan Qi expert who had reached the Sky Xuan rank. He was the only person in the entire kingdom who had the capabilities to challenge Jun Zhan Tian of the Jun family. He was also a Grand Duke. Dugu Xiao Yi\u2019s father \u2013 Dugu Wudi and three uncles were great generals in the kingdom. Moreover, her seven brothers were serving in the military. Therefore, the might of the Dugu family was only slightly behind the present Jun family\u2019s.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In fact, he had become overprotective of his daughter. Therefore, he had been labelled as the \u2018tough meat\u2019 of the kingdom. He would mobilize his entire army if anyone so much as bullied his daughter.In fact, that \u2018tough meat\u2019 mobilized his entire army at the slightest cue. Who would dare to provoke such a person? Dugu Xiao Yi had beaten-up Jun Mo Xie even though he was under the protection of Jun Zhan Tian. This didn\u2019t mean that Grandpa Jun couldn\u2019t oppose Great General Dugu Wudi. However, he knew that Grandfather Dugu would interfere in case he mobilized his own army. After all, Great General Dugu Wudi had inherited his overprotective nature from his own father. Therefore, Jun Xie feared Dugu Xiao Yi the most\u2026 second only to Grandpa Jun. In fact, he sometimes feared Dugu Xiao Yi even more than Grandpa Jun. After all, his Grandpa would never hurt him physically. He \u2013 at the most \u2013 would preach him boring lessons. Dugu Xiao Yi \u2013 on the other hand \u2013 had no such reservations. Jun Mo Xie was always at the risk of getting thrashed by her \u2013 sometimes for no reason at all.Even a person of Jun Mo Xie\u2019s background couldn\u2019t dare to provoke Dugu Xiao Yi. So, the other people obviously didn\u2019t stand any chance in front of her.But now, the precious princess of the Dugu family had walked in the Thousand Gold Hall by herself.Jun Xie tilted his head to one side, and pointed his finger at Dugu Xiao Yi\u2019s hand tugging at his ear. He said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t help it. Look at me. Can I do anything about this? All of you can go ahead if you have any brilliant ideas. But, please\u2026 keep me out of it.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you people? Are you not going to welcome me? Do you think that I haven\u2019t got any money to gamble?\u201d Dugu Xiao Yi started at them. She then pulled out her purse, and shook it. She raised her eyebrows and said, \u201cI\u2019ve lots of money.\u201dThat entire group of the debauchees was so scared that they were on the verge of soiling their pants. [You do have a lot of money. But, who has the guts to win your money? Anyone who wins against you will be \u2018visited\u2019 by your grandfather and his army in order to re-collect your debts. And\u2026 that\u2019s the \u2018best\u2019 thing that can happen to that person. But, what about the bad scenarios\u2026? What if your grandfather is in a bad mood? What if he decides to visit this place? Then\u2026 we\u2019re as good as dead.]A fiery light flashed in Tang Yuan\u2019s eyes. He didn\u2019t seem to care about the condition of the rest of the people. He said, \u201cLet\u2019s not worry about irrelevant things. I\u2019ve kept my promise of bringing Third Young Master Jun to this place\u2026 and he\u2019s not going to run away now. So, please return my item to me. You people gave your word to me. A man who can\u2019t keep his promise can\u2019t be considered as a real man. Only a man of word has the right to stand between the Heaven and Earth.\u201dEven someone as calm as Jun Xie felt like puking after he heard Tang Yuan\u2019s words. [Are you saying that you\u2019re a real man? Please don\u2019t degrade the worth of real men.]Only one person among the six young men had been able to maintain his calm. He was Li Feng \u2013 the grandson of the Grand Preceptor Li Shang. His two brothers \u2013 Li Zhen and Li Lin \u2013 also stood behind him. Meng Haizou \u2013 a slim-looking young man with a thin moustache and deep eyes \u2013 stood further behind them. He was the eldest son of the Minister of Personnel \u2013 Meng Jianghu. He was known to be a person of great talent. Two more members of the Meng family stood behind him. They were Meng Liang and Meng Fei.Li Feng smiled and said, \u201cMiss Dugu is personally visiting this place. How can I not welcome her?\u201d He then turned around and issued an order, \u201cServe Miss Dugu in the best possible way. I\u2019ll peel-off your skin if you displease her in any manner.\u201d Then, he looked at Meng Haizou and blinked, \u201cThird Young Master Jun is here. So, let\u2019s conclude our joke. Look at Young Master Tang\u2026 Look how anxious he is. He\u2019s sweating from head-to-toe. Only a man of word has the right to stand between Heaven and Earth. How can we not keep our word? Give him that item.\u201dMeng Haizou nodded and looked at Tang Yuan. \u201cYoung Master Tang, I\u2019m ready to give you the item. But, I can\u2019t compromise on the one-million-and-five-hundred-thousand silver liang.\u201d Tang Yuan nodded. He had gone there to collect the promissory note. He had been so occupied with its thought that he hadn\u2019t given a thought to the one-and-a-half-million silver liang\u2026 even though it was a huge amount of money.Jun Xie sneered in his heart. It was evident that Tang Yuan was extremely scared. However, Li Feng and Meng Haizou weren\u2019t as fearless as they seemed. They wouldn\u2019t have dared to publish the contents of the promissory note even if Tang Yuan hadn\u2019t brought Jun Mo Xie to the Thousand Gold Hall. They knew that making the note public would\u2019ve invited the wrath of both the Tang and Sun families. They would\u2019ve ended-up becoming the blood enemies of both these families. It would\u2019ve been a complete disaster. Therefore, this matter wasn\u2019t as serious as it seemed. The only objective behind creating this scene was to get access to Jun Mo Xie.However, these serious repercussions would cease to exist as soon as the promissory note landed in Tang Yuan\u2019s hands. Then, they would start spreading rumours about the note in order to strike at the Tang family. Jun Xie could clearly foresee the entire situation.\u201cWhat kind of an item can make Young Master Tang so uptight? Let me see it with my own eyes. This is going to be an eye-opening experience for me.\u201d Dugu Xiao Yi seemed extremely curious about the whole matter. She stretched-out her small hand as she saw Tang Yuan\u2019s relieved expression after he had received the note.Tang Yuan\u2019s face became pale. He shoved the piece of paper in his mouth. He chewed it a couple of times and swallowed it. He then smacked his lips with an innocent expression on his face. He had done this with a lightning speed. His fat neck had been stretched out like a giraffe\u2019s as he had swallowed the paper.\u201cBloody\u2026 Fatty\u2026 how dare you mess with me? You certainly have some guts\u2026\u201d Dugu Xiao Yi rushed towards Tang Yuan in an angry manner. She grabbed his collar and lifted-up his two-hundred-and-fifty kilograms of body in the air. She then shouted, \u201cSpit it out!\u201dJun Xie and the other youths\u2019 eyebrows twitched as they saw this scene with slanted eyes. Their lips became blue and crooked, and their faces turned white.\u201cMiss Dugu, it\u2019s nothing\u2026 really. It all started from Third Young Master Jun. We were missing him a lot ever since he had been grounded by his grandfather. We wrote \u2018coming or not\u2019 on a piece of paper. We had a bet that I\u2019ll have to eat the paper if Third Young Master Jun didn\u2019t come\u2026 and Young Master Tang was supposed to eat the paper if he came. That\u2019s the only matter. Master Tang is a real man\u2026 a man true to his word\u2026 hahaha\u2026\u201d Meng Haizou laughed as he explained. He had made up a story on the spot; he truly had some talent. This matter would\u2019ve blown out of proportion if Tang Yuan had been made to spit out the paper\u2026 and if it had fallen into the hands of Dugu Xiao Yi.Jun Xie raised an eyebrow. He looked at Meng Haizou and thought, [This man came up with such a believable excuse in such a short period of time. Moreover, he spoke with a straight face and a steady heart. He\u2019s an exceptional talent. He has guts, rational thinking, and the ability to act on his thoughts.] Jun Xie \u2013 for a short moment \u2013 had wanted Tang Yuan to spit out the paper. He wanted to see this entire matter turning into a huge storm. But, Tang Yuan was Jun Mo Xie\u2019s best friend\u2026 even though he was a useless person. Moreover, Jun Xie was confident that he could easily win among this group of debauchees. So, he had finally given up on the idea. [But\u2026 But, I wanted to\u2026 I really wanted to\u2026 sigh!]Dugu Xiao Yi looked at the youngsters with a sceptical look in her eyes as all of them started to nod like \u2018chickens pecking on rice\u2019. \u201cThat\u2019s true. That\u2019s what had happened,\u201d everyone said in unison. She then released Tang Yuan.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euTang Yuan\u2019s face had become purple as he had been suspended in the air by his neck. He issued a series of retching sounds as Dugu Xiao Yi loosened her grip on his collar. He had refrained himself from breathing since he was fearful that he might end-up coughing out the paper.\u201cDear guests, please come inside,\u201d Li Feng \u2013 the owner of the place said.Jun Xie smiled and marched inside the place with an arrogant and domineering look on his face. He sat down on a chair and propped-up his legs on the table. He looked like a typical rogue with a degenerated attitude.Dugu Xiao Yi frowned. She felt like kicking Jun Mo Xie.\u201cHaven\u2019t you guys been missing me? I was also missing you\u2026 your money. So\u2026 how do you want to play?\u201d Jun Xie gave a wicked smile and said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You\u2019re just like your grandfather\u2026 just the way he was in his heroic days.\u201d His tone was dripping with sarcasm. However, the original Jun Mo Xie wouldn\u2019t have been able to understand it.Meng Haizou looked at Tang Yuan and said, \u201cWe were playing a game of dice with Young Master Tang. But, he wasn\u2019t able to continue the game. How about resuming the game of dice? Is the Third Young Master Jun game for it?\u201d Tang Yuan\u2019s face became red as he heard these words. However, he didn\u2019t say anything.\u201cA game of dice?\u201d Jun Xie exclaimed, \u201cWhy would I fear a game of dice?\u201d He thought, [They\u2019re trying to provoke me again. The original Jun Mo Xie would\u2019ve easily fallen for something like this if he had heard these words!]\u201cI\u2019m up for it\u2026\u201d Dugu Xiao Yi spoke-up in an excited tone. A confused expression appeared on Meng Haizou\u2019s face as he heard her voice.\u201cHurry up! Serve tea to the guests,\u201d Li Feng ordered hurriedly.Several cups of tea immediately arrived, and were placed in front of the guests. Tang Yuan gulped down the contents of his cup in one go. He then wiped his mouth and said, \u201cThird Young Master Jun, your brother is counting on you. You must help me in venting out my anger.\u201dJun Xie laughed in an overwhelming manner, and reached for his cup of tea. Meanwhile, he looked at the faces present at the table.He became suspicious as he noticed the delighted faces of Li Feng and Meng Haizou. He brought the cup of tea close to his nose. He then sniffed it, and slammed it on the table. \u201cIs this the quality of tea that you serve to your customers? It\u2019s very disappointing.\u201dA sniff of the tea was enough for Jun Xie to detect the presence of a drug in it. The aroma of the tea was similar to that of opium. A person\u2019s state of mind would be hugely affected once they had consumed this drug. However, they drug may not have an adverse effect on one\u2019s body. Jun Xie noticed that the color of Meng Haizou\u2019s robe was extremely bright, and it was embroidered in a disorderly fashion. Moreover, a strange smell was emanating out of it. Jun Xie understood that Meng Haizou\u2019s clothing \u2014 coupled with his scent and the drug \u2014 could lead a person to lose his or her mind.There seemed to be a problem with Meng Haizou\u2019s clothing and the tea. They all seemed to be connected. It was clear that there was an extremely skilled pharmacist behind these men.Jun Xie now understood the reason behind Tang Yuan\u2019s extreme steps. He understood why Tang Yuan had pawned his wife.Jun Xie looked at Dugu Xiao Yi\u2019s tea cup and realized that it hadn\u2019t been contaminated with drugs. Jun Xie understood that Li Feng and Meng Haizou didn\u2019t wish to provoke the Dugu family.\u201cWhat are you waiting for? Hurry up! Bring another cup of tea for the Third Young Master Jun,\u201d Li Feng shouted as he saw Jun Xie discard his cup of tea.\u201cDon\u2019t bother! I\u2019m here to gamble\u2026 not to drink tea. I don\u2019t need to come here to enjoy a cup of tea. So, there\u2019s no need to replace it.\u201d Jun Xie then raised his head and gulped down the entire cup in one go.\u201cNow\u2026 hurry up\u2026 and start playing. I\u2019m getting impatient.\u201dLi Feng and Meng Haizou\u2019s faces brightened-up. \u201cAs you say, Third Young Master Jun.\u201d Then, they ordered a servant to lead their way. They soon entered into a vast empty hall. The only furniture inside that huge hall was a stone table and a dozen of chairs. Jun Xie and the others hadn\u2019t come across a single person on their way to this hall. It seemed that Li Feng had cancelled the entirety of his business activities in order to deal with Jun Mo Xie.Jun Xie had sneezed on his way to this place, and had sprayed all his saliva on Tang Yuan\u2019s clothes. Tang Yuan had shouted, and quickly wiped the saliva from his clothes.Then, Jun Xie had rubbed his nose and had spat out some more saliva with a \u2018pei\u2019 sound. \u201cIt\u2019s strange. Why am I feeling so dizzy? I\u2019m also feeling like sneezing a lot.\u201d Li Feng and Meng Haizou looked at each other and smiled. [The medicine has started to show its effects\u2026 hahahaha\u2026]*** ***The Grand Preceptor\u2019s residence\u2026.The Grand Preceptor Li Shang was leaning on a couch; his eyes were half closed. He was listening to a melodious song of a singer from behind the curtain. He smiled and asked, \u201cWhy did you leave this job in the hands of such incapable wastrels? We\u2019ll miss out on a grand opportunity in case they make any mistake. That useless fellow \u2013 Jun Mo Xie is good for nothing. But, we can\u2019t afford to provoke his grandfather \u2013 Jun Zhan Tian. It\u2019ll become a problem for us if he finds out about it.\u201dHe was speaking in a soft tone. However, his words were dripping with admonition. He seemed to be assured and confident about the person sitting in front of him.A white-robed handsome young man sat before him. He had a tall stature with red lips, white teeth and delicate features. He sat still like a mountain; without any hurried movements. His whole persona was exuding a noble elegance. He smiled as he heard the question, and replied, \u201cThis grandchild feels a lot of admiration for grandfather. You\u2019re always very careful about every little detail. But, Jun Mo Xie is just a debauchee. We would be giving him too much importance if we send capable people to deal with him. We\u2019re very well aware of his character. So, it doesn\u2019t matter if we fail now. We\u2019ll get more opportunities in the future. We don\u2019t need to give it much thought. Moreover, it\u2019ll look unusual for capable people to acquaint themselves with a useless person like Jun Mo Xie. This would expose our plan\u2026 and we would end-up losing this opportunity.\u201cIt\u2019s true that Jun Mo Xie is a debauchee. But, he holds himself in very high esteem. Our plan would\u2019ve backfired if we had sent capable people \u2013 with numerous resources at their disposal \u2013 to deal with him.\u201dHis words revealed a trace of irony. He raised his eyebrows and said, \u201cLi Feng and Li Zhen are useless fellows. But, their standard is similar to Jun Mo Xie\u2019s. The phrase \u2013 everyone has their own advantages \u2013 proves to be true in this situation. It\u2019s only wise to use debauchees in order to deal with a debauchee; that too a useless debauchee like Jun Mo Xie. We may even get a pleasant surprise with the two of them dealing with him. Even a stupid person like Jun Mo Xie wouldn\u2019t have fallen for our plan if we had sent our core members to deal with him. Besides this\u2026 hahaha\u2026\u201dHe laughed. He didn\u2019t need to say anything else. It was clear what he meant, [No one uses meat in order to slaughter a chicken\u2026]An expert should only be expected to deal with an expert; a good blade should be used for something which is worthy of it. An expert would feel insulted if he was sent to deal with a useless and defenseless person.If a performer was to sing \u2018White Snow in Early Spring\u2019 in front of a butcher, then not only the performer would feel perplexed\u2026 even the butcher would start feeling drowsy.Li Shang looked at his eldest grandson \u2013 Li You Ran with admiration. \u201cWell said\u2026\u201d He seemed satisfied with his explanation. Li You Ran was the best prospect in the young generation in Li family. He was perfect in terms of gestures, speech, expressions, and leadership-style. Moreover, he was extremely resourceful. He was also a genius in the Xuan Qi cultivation, and had reached the Gold level at the young age of twenty-five. His speed of cultivation was the highest in the Tian Xiang kingdom.However, his most valuable asset was his calm and steady mind. He was neither cocky nor hot-headed. He believed in maintaining an extremely low-key style. Moreover, he was great at devising ingenious strategies. He was capable of devising strategies that enabled him to win a deal while sitting at a distance of thousands of kilometers; even though he was very young. Even Li Shang wouldn\u2019t have been able to match his abilities at his age. Li Shang was extremely proud of his eldest grandson. He knew that it was important for Li You Ran to take the lead in the family in order to make the Li family soar to newer heights.Li You Ran never underestimated anyone. This was probably the best trait of his personality. He analyzed each and every aspect of a plan while implementing it. He analyzed every single aspect of a person while dealing with him or her. He always maintained an indifferent attitude; even while dealing with a person like Jun Mo Xie. He never \u2013 at any point of time \u2013 showed even a little ridicule while discussing about him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSuch a person was born to be a leader; irrespective of where he was placed.\u201cThis strategy sounds good. But, we shouldn\u2019t take any chances. We should remove the possibility of any \u2018what if\u2019 that may arise. It\u2019ll be the best situation\u2026 if we succeed in our first attempt.\u201d Both of them believed that Jun Mo Xie couldn\u2019t escape their trap. After all, it was Li You Ran\u2019s brilliant plan which had gone through Tang Yuan. In fact, they\u2019d know that something wasn\u2019t right if Jun Mo Xie somehow escaped this trap. But, they would enter the second phase of their planning if Jun Mo Xie fell for that plan. After that, Jun Mo Xie would never be able to escape. Jun Zhan Tian may have refused to serve them at this moment. But, he\u2019d certainly break down because of his useless grandson. And, their purpose would be served in that case since Jun Zhan Tian wouldn\u2019t pose any threat to them.\u201cWhat if?!\u201d Li You Ran frowned as he reconsidered every little detail of his plan. He shook his head and said, \u201cI don\u2019t think there are any other possibilities. Don\u2019t forget that I\u2019ve included Meng Haizou in my plan. I know that he isn\u2019t a big talent\u2026 but he\u2019s enough to deal with someone like Jun Mo Xie. Jun Mo Xie can\u2019t escape my trap this time.\u201d\u201cWhat will happen if he manages to escape your trap?\u201d Li Shang asked in a joking tone.\u201cWhat if he manages to escape?\u201d Li You Ran seemed lost in thoughts. He then started to laugh. After that, he looked at the door and said, \u201cIf he manages to escape\u2026 then he\u2019s not Jun Mo Xie.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He had carefully studied Jun Mo Xie\u2019s character while formulating his strategy, and hadn\u2019t left any loophole in his planning. So, his plan was a guaranteed success. However, Jun Mo Xie was no longer the target of his plan; it was Jun Xie. Therefore, an unexpected error had appeared in You Ran\u2019s planning.Could You Ran\u2019s plan still proceed as he had expected?*** ***The Thousand Gold Hall\u2026Everyone was seated. Li Feng asked, \u201cShall we start the bet with Third Young Master Jun\u2019s usual amount \u2013 one-thousand liang? Or should we increase it?\u201d\u201cStart with one-thousand liang?\u201d Dugu Xiao Yi was shocked. Her face had turned red. \u201cYou guys are going to start betting with such a big amount?\u201d Dugu Xiao Yi was only carrying an amount of one-hundred liang in her purse. She hadn\u2019t expected the bet to start from one-thousand liang. After all, she was the only daughter of the Dugu family. So, all her needs and necessities were taken care of by her servants. All she ever bought for herself was some silver and gold jewellery; that too occasionally. Therefore, she didn\u2019t have any idea about the money needed to bet in the Thousand Gold Hall.A thousand liang wasn\u2019t an extraordinary amount. However, a thousand silver liang weighed around dozens of kilograms. No one could wander about carrying such a huge weight in one\u2019s pockets. Therefore, everyone used bills.\u201cA thousand liangs? No\u2026 no\u2026 it would take too long. I don\u2019t have so much time to waste. Let\u2019s start the bet with ten-thousand liang with no upper limit. I\u2019ve plenty of money. This small amount of money isn\u2019t worth it,\u201d Jun Xie laughed and said.Tang Yuan was shocked. \u201cThird Young Master, one-thousand liang isn\u2019t an ordinary amount of money.\u201d Tang Yuan knew that Jun Mo Xie was only carrying fifty-thousand liang with him. This money would soon vanish if he started the bet with ten-thousand liang. However, he soon realized that it was better to be done with it as soon as possible. After all, he had already lost a huge amount of money a while back. Moreover, he had already recovered the promissory note. So, he didn\u2019t want to push Jun Mo Xie to a dangerous spot. He thought that it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal to lose fifty-thousand liang. So, he decided not to interfere in this matter.\u201cThe Third Young Master is a very forthright person. The game of dice is my favourite. One has to rely on one\u2019s luck in order to win this game. Moreover, both the sides can clearly see the result of the roll. So, it\u2019s fair and reasonable,\u201d Meng Haizou laughed and said.\u201cStop this nonsense now\u2026 Tell me, what are the rules of the game? The higher value wins or the smaller? Or are we guessing the values?\u201d Jun Xie asked in an impatient manner. His eyes seemed slightly red. It seemed as if the drug had started to show its effect.It seemed that the time was about to come.Meng Haizou noticed Jun Xie\u2019s eyes. He then said, \u201cWe can bet either on higher or on smaller scores. What do you think?\u201dJun Xie nodded, \u201cCall!\u201dThe first step for the people participating in the game of dice was that they would take out the required number of silver bills. Then, they would roll the dice. The person with the highest dice roll would become the banker. The number of dice to be used in the game varied according to the number of people participating in the game. Seven dice were used if seven people were participating in the game. Similarly, six dice were used if six people were participating. Finally, the winner became the banker in the last round.Only Jun Xie, Meng Haizou, Li Feng and Li Zhen were playing the game of dice now. Tang Yuan had already lost a lot of money, and Dugu Xiao Yi wasn\u2019t carrying enough money. Even the Emperor couldn\u2019t play without money; then how could she? She sat on the side and watched them play. Her face was flushed red with shame.Suddenly, a bright idea crossed Jun Xie\u2019s mind. He decided to take advantage of a powerful backer like Dugu Xiao Yi. He said, \u201cMiss Dugu is a woman. So, she can\u2019t join us in the game. Why don\u2019t Miss Dugu play across the board?\u201dDugu Xiao Yi\u2019s eyes lit-up with excitement. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cPlaying across the board means making an outside bet. So, one can make a bet without participating in the game. For example, you can bet five silver liang on me. Both of us will lose our money if I lose the game. But, if I win the game\u2026 then your returns and interest amount will add up to ten liang,\u201d Jun Xie explained.\u201cThat\u2019s alright.\u201d Dugu Xiao Yi\u2019s spirits seemed to have lifted. She said, \u201cSo, I\u2019ll bet five liang on you in the first round.\u201dJun Xie laughed. \u201cA beauty like you is betting on me. My luck won\u2019t betray me now.\u201dLi Feng sneered in his heart as he saw this, [Laugh as much as you want. But, be ready to cry soon.]Everyone \u2013 except Jun Xie \u2013 had thrown their dice. Meng Haizou was currently leading the score. One of his dice showed six, and the others showed five. The total score had become 16 as a result. This score was quite high. The only way to beat him was to get at least seventeen points.Li Feng looked exulted. It would be extremely easy to control Jun Mo Xie as long as Meng Haizou remained the banker. They wanted Jun Mo Xie to keep losing until he lost even his clothes. Their plan would start working as soon as he became mad owing to his loss.Jun Xie smiled as he held the three dice in his hand. However, he was cursing in his heart. He knew that the dice had also been tempered along with his tea. They seemed to be filled with something else \u2013 other than lead \u2013 as their balance felt wrong to him.The dice weren\u2019t weighing to one side. This meant that the dice weren\u2019t filled with lead. Jun Xie understood that the dice were filled with mercury as they were uniform in weight. Only the person familiar with these kind of dice could roll out his desired score. An average person couldn\u2019t do anything about it even if he knew that he had been cheated. However, Jun Xie\u2026Jun Xie exhaled a long breath. He then twisted his wrist and tossed the dice into the dice cup. The dice collided with the cup with a loud sound. Simultaneously, Jun Xie placed his right hand on the table and issued a thin strand of Qi \u2013 as thin as a needle \u2013 towards the dice cup.Everyone\u2019s eyes were widened in shock as they saw the dice rolling in the cup.The dice kept on rolling for a short while before coming to a stop.\u201cHow\u2019s it possible?\u201d Li Zhen cried out. He looked depressed.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euMeng Haizou and his group let out a sigh. However, Tang Yuan was cheering, laughing and dancing.The three dice rolled by Jun Xie displayed the scores of six, five, and another six. His score was one point higher than Meng Haizou\u2019s.Meng Haizou and his group looked at Jun Xie in shock, [This bastard must\u2019ve stepped on some lucky dog-poop today.]Jun Xie cried out in excitement, \u201cMiss Dugu\u2019s luck is working! Your presence has led to my fortune. There\u2019ll be a bloodbath today.\u201d He then picked-up the dice cup and shook it. \u201cPut down your bet\u2026 put down your bet\u2026 do it quickly.\u201d He looked extremely impatient.Jun Xie then slammed the cup on the table. His right hand was still placed on the table. There was a strained look on his face. However, his internal energy had already reached the cup.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was extremely proficient in listening to the dice\u2019s movements; especially if he had prepared the dice himself. Everyone at the table \u2013 except Tang Yuan and Dugu Xiao Yi \u2013 were desperate to see Jun Mo Xie lose right down to his last piece of clothing.Meng Haizou pondered for a while with closed eyes. He then opened his eyes and said in a confident manner, \u201cHigh!\u201d Then, he placed fifty-thousand worth of silver bills on the big section. Li Feng and the rest of the group followed his lead. Their faces showed traces of excitement and curiosity about what was going to happen.Tang Yuan was shocked. He knew that Jun Mo Xie was only carrying an amount of fifty-thousand liang with him. He wouldn\u2019t be able to pay the money back to everyone in case he lost this round.The dice turned over in the cup as Jun Xie\u2019s internal energy moved. Jun Xie then shouted, \u201cAll the bets have been decided now. So, I\u2019m opening the cup.\u201d He then opened the dice cup. One of the dice had scored two and two dice had scored one each. It was a total score of four \u2013 a low score.Meng Haizou\u2019s face became pale. How was it possible? He had clearly heard at least one of the dice scoring six. There were ninety percent chances of the total score being on the higher side. However, not a single dice had scored a six. He began to ponder if he had miscalculated and heard the score of a one for a six.Jun Xie collected everyone\u2019s bills without any hesitation, and put them on his side of the table. He then gave Dugu Xiao Yi ten silver liang out of them. After that, he gave her an additional amount of a thousand liang and said, \u201cMiss Dugu, congratulations! Thanks a lot for your good fortune. Please accept this one-thousand liang as a bonus.\u201dDugu Xiao Yi received the silver bills with a joyful expression on her face. She had narrowed her eyes into thin lines. She then patted Jun Xie\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cWell done, Little Jun. I\u2019ll bet on you again in the next round. I\u2019ll place a bet for one-thousand liang.\u201d Dugu Xiao Yi seemed to have forgotten in her excitement that she highly detested Jun Mo Xie and that he was a debauchee.Li Feng faked a smiled and said, \u201cThird Young Master\u2019s luck is on a high today. He has started the game so successfully.\u201d He then secretly looked at Meng Haizou with a questioning look in his eyes. Meng Haizou\u2019s face looked pale. He shook his head as an indication of his cluelessness regarding the whole matter.Jun Mo Xie had consumed the drugs. Moreover, the dice they were using were the ones Meng Haizou was most familiar with. Could it all just be a coincidence? Was it possible that he had made a mistake? After all, he hadn\u2019t still reached at a very high level of the skill of listening to the dice. However, he had still lost only one game. He would get more opportunities. He could try and win the next games. He had plenty of time and money.However, it was Jun Xie who won the next games. He continued to win until he had earned around three-million liang. Dugu Xiao Yi had also won around twenty-thousand silver bills. The faces of the Meng and Li groups had lost their color.\u201cYou\u2026 you\u2026 you\u2026 you\u2019re cheating! You cheater!\u201d Li Zhen jumped. His face had turned red. He had been betting with the biggest amount of money. His seven-hundred-thousand worth of silver bills had been reduced to a few liang. He pointed his finger at Jun Xie and spoke in an angry manner.Even Meng Haizou had become doubtful. How could he make a wrong guess repeatedly? He noticed that Jun Mo Xie still look dazed from his eyes. Then, how could he keep on winning? Had the God of Wealth decided to bless him all of a sudden? It would\u2019ve been a coincidence if it had happened a couple of times. However, the same thing happening over and over again couldn\u2019t be a coincidence.\u201cYou can leave in case you don\u2019t have more money. Don\u2019t play if you don\u2019t want to lose anymore.\u201d Jun Xie said without even looking at him. \u201cOne must identify the stolen goods if one wants to catch a thief. Similarly, one must identify one\u2019s cheating if one wants to point a finger at someone. So, did you see me cheating? Miss Dugu, you\u2019re a high-ranked expert. Did you see me doing anything wrong?\u201dLi Zhen looked at Jun Xie as if he would kill him. However, he felt fearful since Dugu Xiao Yi had been involved in the matter. Moreover, he knew that he was wrong.Dugu Xiao Yi didn\u2019t have the slightest clue about the rules of the game. Moreover, she wasn\u2019t as high-ranked as Jun Xie had claimed her to be. However, she had won twenty-thousand liang after betting in favor of Jun Mo Xie. So, she was ecstatic. She replied, \u201cYou guys are a bunch of losers. You couldn\u2019t stop laughing when you were winning. You even forced someone to get someone\u2019s help. And now\u2026 since you\u2019re losing\u2026 you\u2019re accusing people of cheating on you. You people from Li family have some guts to do something like this. I\u2019ve been sitting beside Little Jun all this time. All he had done is roll the dice. What else could he do? How could he cheat?\u201d\u201cWho\u2026 forced whom to ask for help?\u201d Li Zhen asked.Dugu Xiao Yi pointed her finger at Tang Yuan and said, \u201cHim. He went to get Jun Mo Xie to this place. It would be really strange if he hadn\u2019t been called for help. Moreover, Tang Yuan is only looking at you guys\u2026 and isn\u2019t playing himself even though he\u2019s a great gambler. This means that he has lost everything he had to you guys. He wouldn\u2019t have just sat here if he had money to play with you. Do you guys think that this woman is a fool?\u201dEveryone was surprised. No one had guessed that such an impulsive young woman could have such an astute mind.*** ***The Grand Preceptor\u2019s Residence\u2026\u201cJun Mo Xie has entered the Thousand Gold Hall. But, he\u2019s been accompanied by Miss Dugu Xiao Yi of the Dugu family,\u201d a bodyguard entered the room and reported.\u201cDugu Xiao Yi? Why would she go to the Thousand Gold Hall?\u201d Li You Ran frowned.\u201cJun Mo Xie hadn\u2019t taken her with him on purpose. They had actually met on the road. In fact, Jun Mo Xie had been thrashed by her. Then, she had forced him to take her to the Thousand Gold Hall.\u201d It seemed that the bodyguard had been watching them all this while from the shadows.\u201cIt\u2019s alright that he didn\u2019t take her with him on purpose. But, this has presented an unplanned situation in front of us. Jun Mo Xie\u2026 this bastard is very lucky.\u201d Li You Ran then smiled and said, \u201cWell, you should immediately inform Li Feng, Li Zhen and Meng Haizou to abandon today\u2019s plans. Tell them to leave the game\u2026 even if they have to lose some money. Tell them to fix another meeting with Jun Mo Xie. Now, go fast.\u201d\u201cSure\u2026\u201d the bodyguard replied and left the room.\u201cThat was a quick decision; that too a brilliant one.\u201d Li Shang laughed. \u201cIf Jun Mo Xie had fallen into our trap in front of Dugu Xiao Yi\u2026 then she would\u2019ve definitely spread the news after returning to her family. Then, those oldies would\u2019ve been able to see through our planning. It isn\u2019t wise to beat the grass before attacking a snake. It\u2019s sensible to give up the plan for now. It\u2019s also a great idea to let Jun Mo Xie win some money. This will boost-up his confidence\u2026 and he\u2019ll agree for another game sometime later.\u201dLi You Ran smiled. Suddenly, a thought crossed his mind. Could it be that Jun Mo Xie had brought Dugu Xiao Yi with him on purpose? He felt like laughing out loud. How could a dimwit like Jun Mo Xie think like that?It seemed that the bastard was indeed lucky.However, Li You Ran didn\u2019t know that it was already too late.Their problem couldn\u2019t be solved by losing a little amount of money.*** ***The Thousand Gold Hall\u2026The gambling rules were changed thrice owing to various objections. Jun Xie kept on buzzing arrogantly; so much so that smoke seemed to be rising out of the heads of the Li and Meng brothers. However, he still continued to win. The Li and Meng brothers had lost all their money by this time.The winners \u2013 Jun Xie and Dugu Xiao Yi \u2013 were busy in dividing the money among themselves. The others started at them with jealousy as they saw the piles of money lying in front of them. They felt as if they won\u2019t be able to control their anger as they saw Jun Xie counting the money out loud.[That\u2019s our money!]Dugu Xiao Yi grabbed a handful of bills when Jun Xie wasn\u2019t looking. Then, she stuffed them into her bosom with a lightning speed. The value of those bills would be at least one-hundred-thousand liang. She then said, \u201cJun Mo Xie, you won because of my presence. So, you wouldn\u2019t mind if I take some more of those bills. Would you?\u201d[You\u2019ve already stuffed those bills in your bosom. I\u2019ll be declared a perverted person if I try to take those.] He touched his nose and said, \u201cOf course\u2026 I don\u2019t mind. Why would I mind? I\u2019ve only won because of Miss Dugu\u2019s presence. It\u2019s fine if you take some more.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euDugu Xiao Yi\u2019s eyes lit-up. She smiled and said, \u201cIn that case\u2026 shall I take some more?\u201dJun Xie was shocked. He titled his head and said, \u201cMiss Dugu, you\u2019ve already received your winning amount. You\u2019ve also taken my bonus. A human shouldn\u2019t be so shameless.\u201d\u201cHehe\u2026 I\u2019m just teasing you. It\u2019s only a little amount of money. Look at your miserable face!\u201d Dugu Xiao Yi shouted in a pleasant manner. She realized that her decision to come and explore this place was a good one. She got to witness such an addictive game of dice. Moreover, she made a huge profit of two-hundred-thousand liang. She felt elated.[A little amount of money? She thinks that one-hundred-thousand liang is a little amount of money?] Tang Yuan looked-on helplessly. He too wanted to grab some money. But, he didn\u2019t have the guts to do that. He started to feel depressed as Jun Xie didn\u2019t even bother to look at him. [Well\u2026 I\u2019m a man. I can\u2019t follow a woman and grab some money for myself. Humph! Why am I not a woman?]Jun Xie felt smothered in his heart as he noticed Tang Yuan\u2019s expressions. [You\u2019re a two-hundred-and-fifty kilograms of a fatty. How dare you stare at me in this manner? It seems as if a bitter gourd has been placed on top of the head of a pig. I was thinking of giving you some money. But, after seeing this expression on your face\u2026 forget about it!]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If not\u2026 then I must go home and take some rest. I\u2019ve won such a less amount of money even after investing so much of my time. It has been such a disappointment. What do you think, Miss Dugu?\u201d Jun Xie knew that he had spoiled a part of the enemies\u2019 plan.\u201cYou can\u2019t leave,\u201d Li Zhen said in an anxious manner. Everyone\u2019s minds \u2013 including Meng Haizou\u2019s \u2013 had been frozen; so much so that they couldn\u2019t even estimate the extent of their losses.All of them had a better understanding of gambling than Jun Mo Xie. Moreover, they had all teamed-up in order to corner him. They were sure that Jun Mo Xie had consumed the drugs. In addition, they had tampered with the dice. Meng Haizou\u2019s clothes had also been sprayed with a unique perfume to disturb Jun Mo Xie\u2019s drugged mind. Yet, they had lost to Jun Mo Xie.How could something like that be explained?Was Jun Mo Xie really so lucky? But, he had scored only a few points higher than theirs in each of his game. This couldn\u2019t have been a coincidence. However, they couldn\u2019t explain how he had been cheating. Jun Mo Xie had consumed the drugs, and had turned his gambling skills into a complete mess to cheat. They felt as if they had seen a ghost.Their well-thought plan involving Tang Yuan had gone smoothly at first. However, they hadn\u2019t been able to proceed to the next step of their plan after their main target Jun Mo Xie had arrived. They had lost everything they had instead. How could they even think about going forward with their plan?A trace of fear crawled into their eyes as they realized that they had failed to accomplish the assigned task.They feared the gentle look on Li You Ran\u2019s face more than the laugh of a demon since Li You Ran could issue an order to execute someone\u2026 or several people with the same \u2018gentle\u2019 expression on his face.He was more dangerous than a demon!\u201cI want to continue the game. I still have a few assets left with me,\u201d Meng Haizou spoke as he took off the accompaniment jade from his waist and threw it on the table.\u201cHahaha\u2026 do you guys think that I\u2019m interested in damaged property? You want to continue the game with such a useless item? I would rather go home and take some rest,\u201d Jun Xie smiled and replied. He then shook his head and turned around to leave.\u201cWait!\u201d Meng Haizou shouted. He then looked at Li Zhen and the others and said, \u201cShow me everything you have.\u201dLi Zhen and the rest of people were aware of the consequences of the failure of their scheme. So, they hurriedly took off all the valuable possessions like precious stones, pearls, and other ornaments from their bodies.\u201cThis is Tang Yuan\u2019s personal sword and accompaniment jade. I wish to place a bet with these two. Their combined price is one-and-a-half-million liang. But, I\u2019ll put its value only as one-million liang.\u201d Meng Haizou looked at Jun Xie and said, \u201cJun Mo Xie, I think you would like to win it back for your friend. Don\u2019t you?\u201dDugu Xiao Yi started blankly for a moment. She knew the origins of Tang Yuan\u2019s sword and accompaniment jade. She understood that this was no more just a game. However, she wasn\u2019t scared. She didn\u2019t try to escape from the situation either. This situation was far too interesting.Jun Xie looked at Tang Yuan and said, \u201cI\u2019m not Tang Yuan. His possessions have nothing to do with me. They\u2019ll become my possessions if I win this game. Then, I can do anything I want with them. I may throw them in the garbage\u2026 or I may give them to someone else. It has nothing to do with Tang Yuan. Why would I win them back for him? You people surely are a creative \u2018lot\u2019. Tang Yuan pawned these items for money. That\u2019s none of my business. It won\u2019t be my business\u2026 if he brings money to redeem these items later on.\u201dJun Xie looked at the sword and the jade as he spoke. [These items aren\u2019t ordinary from any standard.]Jun Xie then smiled in an unpleasant manner and said, \u201cYoung Master Meng, what do you think? What I\u2019m saying is right or not?\u201dEveryone was shocked to hear Jun Xie\u2019s words. Tang Yuan\u2019s face had revealed an excited expression after he had heard Meng Haizou\u2019s words. However, his face soon became pale.Meng Haizou\u2019s expressions changed. He had clearly understood the meaning behind Jun Xie\u2019s words. He seemed confused. He wasn\u2019t sure if he should still proceed with the game. What if they lose the sword and the jade to Jun Mo Xie? What will they do if Tang Yuan comes to them with the money to redeem his assets later on?No one could deny the truth behind Jun Xie\u2019s words. However, there were a few rules to the game. One\u2019s assets could only be sold if one failed to redeem them until a certain period of time. So, it would be unjust to sell Tang Yuan\u2019s possession at present.Tang Yuan had suffered a huge loss at the hands of the Li and Meng brothers. So, he wouldn\u2019t lose the opportunity to create a catastrophe if they failed to return his assets in exchange for money. Moreover, his own shortcomings would provide him with an opportunity to create a catastrophe.Suddenly, a thought crossed Meng Haizou\u2019s mind, [I\u2019m already stuck in a problem. I should first think of getting out of it. I can think of the future later on. Moreover, I\u2019m unlikely to lose the bet this time.]\u201cWe can deal with Tang Yuan on our own. Third Young Master Jun shouldn\u2019t worry about that. Moreover, there\u2019s no guarantee that Third Young Master Jun will win all these items.\u201d Then, Meng Haizou put a jade, a pearl, and a sword on the table. He bit his lip and said, \u201cThird Young Master Jun, this ruyi jade was given to me by His Majesty \u2013 the Emperor. This is my uncle\u2019s most precious sword. And, this glowing pearl was given to Li Feng by the Grand Preceptor Li. These are extremely precious objects. Their combined cost would be in the range of millions of liang. So, the money in Third Young Master\u2019s possession isn\u2019t enough to bet against these items. But, if Third Young Master is willing to play\u2026 then I can allow him to play with something else.\u201d\u201cWhat will you suggest me to play with? Will you ask me to gamble with my body? Or do you want to marry-off your still unmarried little sister to me? But, wait\u2026 I\u2019ve never heard of this little sister of yours,\u201d Jun Xie picked his ear and replied.Dugu Xiao Yi burst out laughing as she heard these words. However, she controlled herself, and resumed her normal expressions. She then kicked Jun Xie from under the table. Jun Xie bit his lip and smiled.Meng Haizou was so angry that he felt like vomiting blood. However, he controlled himself and said, \u201cSo\u2026 Third Young Master Jun likes to joke. But, this bet is quite simple. These precious items will go in the possession of Third Young Master Jun if I lose. But, if I win\u2026 then Third Young Master will have to help me with something. Is that fine?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAre you serious? How can I accept such a condition?\u201d Jun Xie thought, [They\u2019re slowly coming to the point. It must\u2019ve been very hard for them to hold-up until this moment.] He then laughed and said, \u201cAm I supposed to commit suicide if you guys ask me to die? If you ask me to give all the possessions of Jun family to you guys\u2026 then am I supposed to do that? This condition is really\u2026 tsk\u2026 tsk\u2026 Do you think that I\u2019m a fool?\u201d\u201cI assure you that such a thing won\u2019t happen. This bet doesn\u2019t involve any money. Moreover, Third Young Master Jun won\u2019t be harmed in any manner. I\u2019ll only ask you for something that you can easily manage to do. But, we can forget that something like this ever happened if you still think that this bet is impossible\u2026\u201d Meng Haizou felt like punching and kicking Jun Mo Xie.\u201cWell\u2026 in that case\u2026 why not?\u201d Jun Xie nodded. \u201cHow will we bet?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll play a game of dice.\u201d Meng Haizou had a curious expression on his face. He then said, \u201cThis bet is going to be between you and me. There\u2019ll be no banker. Whoever scores the highest will win. Do you accept, Third Young Master?\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026 why would I be afraid of playing with a loser like you; that too a game of dice. Do you think that you can beat me? That\u2019s funny!\u201d Jun Xie\u2019s face revealed an expression as if he was about to soar to the sky. In fact, he would\u2019ve soared to the sky if he hadn\u2019t been kicked below his belt a moment ago.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They knew that Meng Haizou was quite accomplished in the game of dice. He had never lost before this occasion. Moreover, he had prepared the dice himself. It would be highly shocking if Meng Hoizou still didn\u2019t win. Everyone was aware of Jun Mo Xie\u2019s low skills in gambling. However, they were still clueless about how he had won the previous games. But, this game was between Meng Haizou and Jun Mo Xie. Therefore, it was almost impossible for Jun Mo Xie to win.\u201cWho\u2019ll roll first?\u201d Jun Xie\u2019s legs shook as he asked. His leg was still paining from Dugu Xiao Yi\u2019s kick.\u201cI\u2019ll go first.\u201d Meng Haizou grabbed the dice and held them in his hand. He then weighed them as he tried to calm his mind. He closed his eyes, and tried to suppress the rapid flow of blood in his nerves. He then murmured something; he seemed to be begging to someone. He had to win this round. This roll of dice contained the total worth of almost everyone present on the table. So, he knew that he couldn\u2019t afford to lose this game.Jun Xie sighed and gently tapped the table. He then whispered to Dugu Xiao Yi, \u201cDo you feel that he\u2019s trying to summon the spirits of his ancestors to help him in the game? I feel very spooky. Something isn\u2019t right.\u201d Suddenly, he pulled-up his sleeves and shouted, \u201cSee\u2026 I\u2019ve got goose bumps.\u201dDugu Xiao Yi was trying to maintain a straight face since she knew that this game was more than a gamble. However, she burst out laughing as she heard Jun Xie\u2019s words. She couldn\u2019t believe that this wastrel was such an amusing person.Li Feng and his group stared at Jun Xie with anger in their eyes. They understood that he was trying to break the thread of Meng Haizou\u2019s concentration. However, Jun Xie and Tang Yuan didn\u2019t feel anxious. Instead, they stared back at them.Meng Haizou let out a roar after a while. He then lifted his palms in the air, and revolved them. Suddenly, the three dice rolled down on the table and started to spin.\u201cThree sixes\u2026\u201d Li Feng and the other people in his group roared as they looked at the spinning dice. The atmosphere of the Thousand Gold Hall had become extremely fierce. It seemed as if they were in a casino surrounded by hundreds of people.Two dice stopped spinning one-by-one. Both of them had rolled a score of six each.Li Feng and his group burst out into an applause. It seemed as if they had already decided the winner even though the third dice was still spinning. Their eyes lit-up as they shouted, \u201cSix\u2026 six\u2026 six\u2026\u201d Jun Xie would certainly lose if the third dice too rolled a score of six. He could only be saved if he too rolled three sixes in that case. Otherwise, he would lose.But, could three sixes be rolled out so easily? Everyone looked at Jun Xie with an elated look on their faces.The last die finally started to slow down. Its spinning pattern indicated that this too would be a six.Meng Haizou heaved a sigh of relief. This score had surpassed his expectations. Even scoring two sixes was considered to be a great feat in normal times. However, three sixes had assured his success.But then, the third die started to roll towards the other two dice. It continued to spin between the two dice, and then knocked over the die to its left. Then, it started to spin towards the die on its right. It bumped into it and caused it to roll over. After that, it stopped spinning.Suddenly, the room became dead silent.Li Feng, Li Zhen and Meng Haizou couldn\u2019t help but stare in amazement. Their expressions became pale, and their eyes became red. Li Feng and Meng Fei curled-up their lips. It seemed that they would start crying any moment.The three dice now showed the scores of a one, a two and a three. This result would be known as the Common Loss if Meng Haizou was the banker. This also meant that Meng Haizou would lose irrespective of Jun Mo Xie\u2019s score.[It\u2019s over.] Meng Haizou lost his consciousness. The rest of the people stood motionless with a dull expression on their faces. They seemed to be on the verge of crying out loud.\u201cWahahaha\u2026\u201d Tang Yuan jumped-up high in the air. It was impossible to believe that a person like him could achieve such a feat. He grabbed Jun Xie\u2019s shoulders and shouted, \u201cThird Young Master, your luck is on a high today. The God of Wealth has finally arrived\u2026 wahahahaha\u2026\u201d\u201cThe God of Wealth has arrived? No\u2026 the God of Gambling has arrived. It\u2019s my turn to roll the dice.\u201d Jun Xie then faked an expression of fear on his face and said, \u201cYou really scared me with your preparations earlier. I hadn\u2019t expected that you\u2019ll roll over such a high score. I truly admire you.\u201d He laughed and continued, \u201cThis play allows one to roll over any score one wants. It\u2019s unbelievable how one can accomplish anything with one\u2019s heart\u2019s desire. An average person can never achieve this level of competency in this game. You\u2026 you\u2026 you\u2019re really the God of Gamblers.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s your turn? No\u2026 Third Young Master. You don\u2019t need to roll the dice. You\u2019ve already won as per the rules of Common Loss. He has scored a one, a two and a three.\u201d Tang Yuan jumped again several times before he finally came to a stop.\u201cIt\u2019s nonsense! You haven\u2019t won yet. There\u2019s no difference between a banker and a player in this game. What if you also score a one, a two and a three?\u201d Li Feng shouted. He was trembling; his eyes had turned red.\u201cDo you really think that such a scenario is possible?\u201d Tang Yuan sneered. [He\u2019s mad to ask this kind of a question. How could I lose to such a person?]\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Jun Xie laughed and said. \u201cLet me show you my unmatched gambling skills. But before that\u2026 someone wake-up Young Master Meng. I don\u2019t want him to claim that he didn\u2019t see the result with his own eyes. After all, one has to see it to believe it.\u201d[Damn it! How come this idiot is acting so smart today?] Li Feng and the other people in his group looked at each other. The last trick up their sleeve had also failed.Dugu Xiao Yi joined them and said, \u201cIs he still not awake? Don\u2019t worry! A few kicks of mine will wake him up.\u201dMeng Haizou lay awake on the floor. However, he was pretending to be unconscious. He had been planning to deny seeing anything. He was waiting for Jun Mo Xie to throw the dice. Everything would\u2019ve been taken care of once the dice were collected. Meng Haizou would\u2019ve claimed that he didn\u2019t see the result even if everyone confirmed Jun Mo Xie\u2019s win. Then, both of them would have to roll the dice once again, and he would\u2019ve got another chance.Meng Haizou had even planned what he would say, [You\u2019re betting with me\u2026 and not them. So, I\u2019ve to see the result and confirm it. I can\u2019t believe what you\u2019re saying is true\u2026 as I haven\u2019t seen the result with my own eyes.]He couldn\u2019t believe that Jun Mo Xie had seen through his plan. Moreover, he couldn\u2019t afford to bear Dugu Xiao Yi\u2019s kicks.Suddenly, Tang Yuan kicked Meng Haizou before he had the chance to get-up on his own. \u201cStop pretending now. Get up!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euTang Yuan had summed-up all his sufferings and complaints in this one kick. The impact of the kick made Meng Haizou cry out, \u201cOuch!\u201d He got up to see the smiling faces of Jun Mo Xie, Tang Yuan, and Dugu Xiao Yi.Meng Haizou stood-up with a look of resentment in his eyes. He would\u2019ve forcefully imprisoned Jun Mo Xie if Dugu Xiao Yi hadn\u2019t been there.Suddenly, a man entered the room. \u201cSir Meng\u2026 Sir Li\u2026\u201d He stopped in his tracks. He was the same bodyguard who had been sent by Li You Ran. He noticed the expressions on Li Feng\u2019s and the others\u2019 faces. He understood that the situation had been reversed. How could one have estimated that the situation would change in this manner?\u201cNow observe,\u201d Jun Xie spoke as he grabbed the dice. He then looked at Meng Haizou with an expression of pride on his face. The faces of Meng Haizou and his companions looked pale. They clenched their teeth tightly; so much so that a gritting sound could be heard.\u201cI\u2019m rich!\u201d Jun Xie shouted as he left the Thousand Gold Hall. A bodyguard followed him with a huge package. No one had noticed that one of the tea cups had gone missing with Jun Mo Xie\u2019s exit from the Thousand Gold Hall.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Earlier, she had been satisfied that she had won a decent amount of two-hundred-thousand liang. However, Jun Mo Xie had then won innumerable precious treasures in the last round. A few of those treasures were so precious that their value couldn\u2019t be determined in the market.This created a feeling of discomfort and conflict in her heart. [How did this wastrel end-up winning so much money? And I\u2026 who have always been a dutiful daughter\u2026 have earned so less.]Dugu Xiao Yi looked around, [Is it possible to obtain a few items from Jun Mo Xie\u2019s treasure? But, it isn\u2019t decent to ask him directly. Darn! Jun Mo Xie, why don\u2019t you offer a few items to me yourself?]Tang Yuan smiled from ear-to-ear; he looked like the Buddha. He walked-up to the front as fast as a tiger and said, \u201cThird Young Master, I\u2019m very impressed with your style. Hahaha\u2026 I felt so happy to see those bastards lose everything\u2026 ummm\u2026 Brother, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s the right time for you to give the sword and accompaniment jade to me?\u201d\u201cTo give them to you?!\u201d Jun Xie stopped dead in his tracks. He asked in a surprised manner, \u201cWhat are you saying? Why would I give them to you?\u201d[Why?] Tang Yuan was shocked. \u201cIs it possible that you don\u2019t intend to give them to me?\u201d\u201cGive them to you?\u201d Jun Xie looked even more surprised. \u201cI don\u2019t think that I\u2019m duty-bound to give anything to you. I don\u2019t understand what you are talking about.\u201d\u201cI\u2026I\u2026I\u2026\u201d Tang Yuan was truly in a pathetic condition. He understood that Jun Mo Xie considered these items as his own since he had won them in a bet. How could he ask him to part with such precious treasure? However, he was worried about what would happen if his father was to ask him about his possessions. He could still take care of the money problem. But, the biggest problem he was facing at present was that his assets were now in Jun Mo Xie\u2019s possessions, and he had no way to get them back.Tang Yuan finally accepted this reality. He had understood that Jun Mo Xie\u2019s win had nothing to do with solving his problems. He shuddered as he thought of his father\u2019s face.\u201cI can\u2019t just give them to you. I never do anything without getting something in return\u2026 never\u2026\u201dJun Xie shook his head and replied. He then looked at Tang Yuan\u2019s depressed face and added, \u201cBut, I can sell them to you. I can also get some benefit from this matter in that case. What do you think?\u201d Jun Xie held out a finger as he said.\u201cHahahaha\u2026 you\u2019re my genuine brother\u2026\u201d Tang Yuan became extremely excited. He jumped at Jun Xie and hugged him tightly. He didn\u2019t even consider what benefits he was going to give out in this matter.Tang Yuan didn\u2019t even consider that a person like Jun Mo Xie won\u2019t be able to bear the weight of his body. Both of them fell to the ground, with Jun Xie getting squashed below Tang Yuan\u2019s body. Only the fat slabs of Tang Yuan\u2019s heavy body could be seen. Not even a single corner of Jun Xie\u2019s clothing could be seen beneath him.Dugu Xiao Yi burst out laughing as she saw this, [These two morons are so funny\u2026]Everyone rushed towards them, and pulled-up Tang Yuan\u2019s fat body. Jun Xie looked as if he had been choked to death. His entire body had been surrounded by multiple layers of fat; so much so that not even the air could reach him. He looked despondent. [I could never think that a mountain of a man would fall down on me today. I\u2019ve just been to hell.]\u201cYou fatty, you\u2019ve made me very angry now. You\u2019ll now have to pay more. I\u2019ll not sell the sword and the accompaniment jade for less than one-million silver liang. But, this price is just for today. Tomorrow\u2026 you\u2019ll have to pay one-and-a-half-million liang.\u201d Jun Xie said as he straightened his body. He felt like puking since his nose had been filled with the smell of fat.\u201cWhat?!\u201d Tang Yuan screamed.The group came to a halt as they arrived at a crossroad.There were Jun and Tang residences to the east, and the Dugu family residence to the west.Suddenly, Dugu Xiao Yi felt a mysterious feeling rising in her heart as she realized that it was time to separate. She looked at Jun Xie and saw his crooked smile. [This bastard Jun Mo Xie is an infamous debauchee. I\u2019ve always repelled him, and have beaten him up on a few occasions. But, he seems to be a very interesting person today.]She shouted out, \u201cJun Mo Xie, will you be coming to my grandfather\u2019s birthday celebration?\u201dJun Xie seemed shocked, \u201cI\u2019ll come if my family members don\u2019t have any problem with it.\u201dDugu Xiao Yi bit her lip and asked, \u201cWhat if your family members don\u2019t want you to come?\u201d\u201cThen, I\u2019ll not go.\u201d Jun Xie was confused. [Why would I go if my family members forbid me? So that I can get a bashing\u2026?]\u201cBastard!\u201d Dugu Xiao Yi cursed in an angry manner as she heard his reply. She then rushed towards him and started to kick him. \u201cDon\u2019t dare to make this mistake. Otherwise, I\u2019ll thrash you every single time I see you.\u201dJun Xie realized that he was stuck in a big problem. The ace assassin of the world had to undergo this torture by a little girl. [When will this body transform enough to meet my expectations\u2026?] He covered his face with both his hands and shouted, \u201cI\u2019ll come\u2026 I\u2019ll come\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s like a good boy. At least you\u2019re smart. Take out some time to prepare a good present for my grandfather. The worth of the present mustn\u2019t be less than what you\u2019ve won today.\u201d She moved her vision from him\u2026 and to the huge package that was being carried by the bodyguard. She then turned away while rubbing her wrist. After that, she held her hands behind her back, lifted her chin, and walked down the road like a proud deer.It was evident that Dugu Xiao Yi wanted the treasures won by Jun Xie. But, her attitude towards Jun Mo Xie had changed. However, she still considered him to be a debauchee.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euJun Xie looked at the departing figure of Dugu Xiao Yi. He then turned towards Tang Yuan and said with a smile, \u201cYoung Master Tang is very talented\u2026 hehehe\u2026 You even lost your fianc\u00e9e in the bet. I can\u2019t help but admire you.\u201dTang Yuan became furious; his face turned red.Jun Xie\u2019s body turned cold as he saw Tang Yuan\u2019s reaction. \u201cTang Yuan, it\u2019s not a joke. You almost got me killed this time. Do you even understand how strange today\u2019s incidents were?\u201d\u201cWhat?! I almost got you killed?\u201d Tang Yuan was shocked. He could never imagine that he would hear such words from Jun Mo Xie\u2019s mouth.\u201cDo you really think that you lost everything because of your bad luck? Are you really that stupid? You lost all your money, your sword, and your accompaniment jade. You even pawned off your fianc\u00e9e. Just think about it. Are you really that kind of an idiot? How could you not think about the consequences of this entire matter? You knew that your actions could put the reputations of two respected families in jeopardy\u2026! How could you not even consider that? Don\u2019t you think that something isn\u2019t right?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His vision pierced Tang Yuan\u2019s heart as he asked, \u201cDo you really think that you would have the guts to do something as crazy as this?\u201dTang Yuan had been crying. Suddenly, a calm expression flashed across his face. He wasn\u2019t a dimwit. In fact, he was rather shrewd. He calmed his mind down, and started to recall the happenings of the day. The more he analysed the events\u2026 the surer he became that something had been suspicious about the whole matter. He eventually realized that he couldn\u2019t have done something like that even in his dreams \u2013 that is\u2026 if he had been in his senses.However, he had done that. But, how and why?[Am I such a despicable person? I accept that I\u2019m not the most exceptional and well-behaved person\u2026 but I know where to draw the line. I wouldn\u2019t have done something like that if I had been in my senses\u2026 even if I was challenged by death itself. Today, I not only did something like that once\u2026 but repeatedly. Each of my action was more shameful and disgusting than the previous one. I would rather die than do something that disgraces and disrespects my entire family. These actions can send me to an abyss with no hope of a return.][Then, why did I do those things?]Tang Yang seemed extremely confused.\u201cWas Meng Haizou wearing the same clothes when you entered the Thousand Gold Hall earlier?\u201d Jin Xie asked with hard eyes and an evil smile on his face.\u201cYes. But, what does his clothes have to do with this matter? Was something wrong with them?\u201d Tang Yuan was still confused.\u201cDid you smell a perfume from his clothes? It was quite unique\u2026 wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Jun Xie continued with his questioning.\u201cYes\u2026 it was a different kind of a smell,\u201d Tang Yuan replied in a perplexed tone.\u201cDid they serve you a cup of tea before you started with the game\u2026 as they did with me?\u201d Jun Xie asked further.\u201cYes\u2026 But, what about it?\u201d Tang Yuan asked.\u201cWhat about it? Humph! Humph! Nothing much\u2026 It was just the beginning of your eternal damnation,\u201d Jun Xie sneered and said.Suddenly, Tang Yuan jumped-up. He seemed shocked. It turned out that he wasn\u2019t as much of a fool. \u201cYou mean\u2026 that\u2026 there was something wrong with the tea?\u201d\u201cSomething wrong with the tea\u2026?\u201d Jun Xie sneered. \u201cThere was something wrong with everything\u2026 his clothes\u2026 his perfume\u2026 the tea\u2026 everything. Why would anyone serve tea to a gang of gamblers before the start of a game? What kind of a norm can that be? You idiot! How could you not notice such an obvious thing?\u201d\u201cYou also drank the tea\u2026 didn\u2019t you? But, you look fine\u2026\u201d Tang Yuan became even more confused.\u201cDo you remember that I sneezed on your clothes after I drank the tea\u2026 when your clothes had become wet?\u201d Jun Xie said with a smile.\u201cYes\u2026 I remember,\u201d Tang Yuan recalled the incident and answered.\u201cPeople discharge sputum when they sneeze\u2026 But, I made your clothes wet. Didn\u2019t you find anything unusual about it?\u201d Jun Xie tilted his head to one side and asked.Suddenly, a realization dawned on Tang Yuan, \u201cOh\u2026 so that what\u2019s had happened? But, how do you know so much about this matter?\u201d[How do I know so much? That\u2019s a difficult question. How do I tell him that I\u2019m so familiar with these kinds of drugs that I can tell them with a sniff? In fact, even the pores of my body could detect the presence of these drugs in my past life.]Jun Xie rubbed his nose. He thought that the only way to get out of this situation was to give a bad name to himself, \u201cI know because I\u2019ve played the same tricks myself. Do you understand now?\u201d\u201cThis was expected from Third Young Master Jun\u2026 It\u2019s indeed quite a smooth trick. You\u2019re truly a great expert, Third Young Master,\u201d Tang Yuan spoke with admiration.Jun Xie was on the verge of bursting out with laughter. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s true that you\u2019ve taken care of the promissory note. But, these guys will do everything in their power to spread this news. How are you going to deal with this problem?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right! What should I do?\u201d Tang Yuan became anxious as he heard Jun Xie\u2019s words.\u201cYou should go back home\u2026 and tell everything that happened to your grandfather\u2026 Everything\u2026 without concealing or exaggerating any detail. Let your grandfather decide the further course of action. Let him not hear about this matter from anyone else other than you. Otherwise, you\u2019re finished,\u201d Jun Xie laughed secretly as he said.He continued, \u201cI don\u2019t think that your grandfather will blame you\u2026 since you had been set-up by those guys. We both know that your grandfather is much more capable of dealing with these kinds of matters than you are. I guess that you must be extremely angry over those guys. Am I right? Let me tell you something. Leave your sword and accompaniment jade with me for now. Then, take one-million liang worth of silver bills to those guys in order to redeem your assets. Naturally, they won\u2019t be able to return those items to you. Then\u2026 do you understand?\u201d Jun Xie said in a sinister tone. It seemed as if a devil was tempting an innocent layman to commit a crime.Tang Yuan slapped his thigh and said, \u201cYou\u2019re right! This is the only way to get an upper-hand over those guys. But, they can easily redeem those items from you in exchange for money\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re truly an idiot! They had used the sword and the accompaniment jade as a wager against my promise\u2026 not money. So, why would I give these items to them in exchange for money? Have you still not understood anything?\u201d Jun Xie laughed and said.\u201cOh\u2026 right!\u201d Tang Yuan exclaimed.Jun Xie then took out a teacup from his bosom with a smile on his face. There were still a few drops of tea at the bottom of the cup.\u201cThey served the drugged tea in this cup. I picked it up earlier. See\u2026 there are still a few drops of tea left in it.\u201d Jun Xie smiled.\u201cHahahaha\u2026 you\u2019re truly a professional, Third Young Master.\u201d Tang Yuan carefully took the cup from Jun Xie. He then started to roll away like a wild horse runs after its rear has been sliced open. \u201cSo\u2026 you\u2019re plotting against me? Now, I\u2019ll plot against you\u2026\u201dJun Xie smiled as he saw the receding figure of Tang Yuan. Both Tang Yuan\u2019s and his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s families were quite influential. So, the Li and Meng families certainly had busy days ahead of them. And, Jun Xie had already reserved a chair for himself in order to watch the upcoming \u2018show\u2019.However, the outcome of the incident in the Thousand Gold Hall would\u2019ve been something else if not for the sudden emergence of Dugu Xiao Yi and the change in the personality of Jun Mo Xie. Jun Xie wasn\u2019t scared of Meng Haizou or Li Feng. However, he would\u2019ve invited the attention of countless enemies if he had exposed his real strength in front of them. Then, Jun Xie wouldn\u2019t have been in an advantageous position.Jun Mo Xie\u2019s enemies were backed by many influential families in the city even though they were first-rate debauchees. Otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t have dared to drug people with strong backgrounds like Jun Mo Xie and Tang Yuan. Would they have dared to act in this manner of they didn\u2019t have a powerful backing?Definitely no! It was simply impossible.Jun Mo Xie was himself an infamous debauchee. However, he had the powerful backing of Jun Zhan Tian. It was true that Grandpa Jun was the only significant person in the Jun family. But, a weak camel is still better than a horse. Nearly one-third of the military generals were under the command of Jun Zhan Tian. And, these generals would support Jun Mo Xie as long as Grandpa Jun was alive. Their bodies had been engraved with the \u2018Jun\u2019 mark; whether they liked it or not.A monstrous storm would be created in the royal court if something was to happen to the Jun family. These people too would fall in case the Jun family fell. They would be suppressed by the other factions to the limit of being unable to fight back. However, these people could stand strong as long as the Jun family existed. So, these people would always come together to fight their enemies; whether they were domestic or foreign.Therefore, it was extremely important that nothing untoward happened to the Jun family; and, especially to Jun Mo Xie. All these people looked down upon him. However, they wouldn\u2019t hesitate to do anything in order to protect him from any danger.This was also true for the Tang family. The Tang family wasn\u2019t as powerful as the Jun family. However, they were one of the most powerful people in the city. So, the combined force of the Jun and Tang families could compel even a mighty family like the Dugu family to take a step backwards.This didn\u2019t mean that the might of the Jun family was any less than the Dugu family. In fact, the Dugu family didn\u2019t dare to raise their heads in front of the Jun family when the Jun family was at its peak for a period of seven years. However, the situation had changed now. The Jun family had lost its mighty members \u2013 except for Jun Zhan Tian \u2013 one after the other, while the Dugu family had continued to churn out new talents. Therefore, they had eventually taken over the Jun family.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euTherefore, the Dugu family was the most influential family now; at least in the eyes of the outsiders.Nonetheless, the Jun family couldn\u2019t lose all its might as long as Jun Zhan Tian was alive. In fact, even the Imperial powers couldn\u2019t dare to take a step against the Jun family.However, the Li and Meng families had come together to plot against Jun Mo Xie and Tang Yuan. This was highly unusual.It seemed that something wasn\u2019t right.The people who had been at the forefront of this plot had been the infamous debauchees of the city. So, no one would\u2019ve taken it seriously even if this matter had been exposed in front of the people. People \u2013 at the most \u2013 would\u2019ve had a good laugh at it. However, what would\u2019ve happened if their plot had been successful?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It wouldn\u2019t have made a great difference to the Tang family as they had other successors besides Tang Yuan. However, Jun Mo Xie was the sole successor of the Jun family.Meng Haizou had put those treasures as wager against Jun Mo Xie\u2019s promise to fulfil his request. No one knew how the matter would\u2019ve ended if Meng Haizou had won; even though it was only a \u2018request\u2019. Moreover, the request had been made to a debauchee like Jun Mo Xie who didn\u2019t know how to judge the severity of a situation. In fact, Jun Mo Xie wouldn\u2019t have been aware that he had caused a disaster. He wouldn\u2019t even be concerned about the whole matter since he would\u2019ve counted upon his grandfather to take care of the situation.However, what would\u2019ve happened if Grandpa Jun\u2019s authority had fallen into the hands of other people? Then, it wouldn\u2019t have made any difference even if Grandpa Jun was willing to severe his relationship with his grandson. What would the generals under him choose? It would\u2019ve been a disaster if even a few of them were to hesitate.Suddenly, Jun Xie started to feel a need to increase his resources and capabilities. He had the fine experiences and knowledge from his past life. However, the incident in the Thousand Gold Hall was an indication that he needed to brush up his skills even further.The first thing that he needed to work on was political awareness since he had greatly lacked this skill in his previous life. In fact, the knowledge about this topic wouldn\u2019t have held much importance to him if he was still a solitary assassin. But now, he needed this knowledge in order to protect the people he cared for from any kind of danger. The stability of this great family couldn\u2019t be maintained without the detailed knowledge of politics.This didn\u2019t mean that he was required to become an official and needed to participate in the political struggles in the royal court. However, he needed to have a detailed knowledge about the political struggles between the other people in the court.*** ***Grandpa Jun returned home at noon. He had bumped into Tang Yuan\u2019s grandfather \u2013 Tang Wanli on his way. Tang Wanli was leading a huge group of warriors on a horseback down the great street at that time. Then, he had turned north. It had seemed that he was on his way to destroy some unlucky fellows\u2026The residences of the great families \u2013 like the Li and Meng families \u2013 were located in the north. Tang Wanli\u2019s face had looked as dark as a black pot, and his eyes had been burning with fury. Grandpa Jun had been immensely happy to see this. [It\u2019s been a long while since this old goat has been so mad at someone. Who could\u2019ve thought that the peaceful Old Tang would become so furious all of a sudden? It doesn\u2019t matter who his target is. But, I\u2019m certainly looking forward to a great show.]However, Grandpa Jun didn\u2019t know that the mastermind behind this entire drama was his own grandson \u2013 Jun Mo Xie.He had asked Old Tang in a curious manner, \u201cBrother Tang, where are you going in such a hurry? Why are you so serious? Can it be that someone has stolen your soon-to-be granddaughter-in-law? Just look at the expressions on your face\u2026 hahahaha\u2026\u201d Grandpa Jun had spoken these words as a joke. However, he didn\u2019t know that what he had said was indeed true\u2026\u201cYou old foggy Jun! You cheap bastard! You aren\u2019t as pure as the driven snow either. I\u2019ll come back and deal with you myself. Let me first take care of the Li and Meng families.\u201d Old Tang then blew his white beard and whipped his horse. His horse started to advance forward at a fast speed. Old Tang knew that Jun Zhan Tian\u2019s grandson Jun Mo Xie was as despicable as his own grandson Tang Yuan. However, he had emerged to be a winner, while his grandson had fallen into such an unfortunate situation. Old Tang suspected that there was a mastermind behind Jun Mo Xie. Otherwise, that dimwit couldn\u2019t have had such an advantage over those guys. And, who could\u2019ve been the great mastermind other than Grandpa Jun? Moreover, this Jun Zhan Tian had now dared to make fun of him on his face. Therefore, Old Tang\u2019s temper had blown out of proportion.Jun Zhan Tian was dumbstruck. He was left standing in a confused state of mind. [What did Old Tang mean by that? He just cursed me for no reason at all. He didn\u2019t even explain what was going on.] Suddenly, he spat and said, \u201cSo, you\u2019re offended with the Li and Meng families. Then, why did you drag me in your scuffle? When dogs bite one another\u2026 their mouths become full of gross hair.\u201dOld Tang was being followed by his grandson \u2013 Tang Yuan. His eyes were full of misery, and his face had turned red with shame. Tang Yuan\u2019s father had been sitting in the family hall when he had returned home. He had cried out loud as soon as he had seen his father, and had asked his parents for their help. His father had been so scared that he had almost fell-off his chair. Tang Yuan had then realized that his grandfather had also been present in the room this entire time.Tang Yuan had then narrated the entire incident in front of his grandfather; he hadn\u2019t hidden any details. What had happened next\u2026 can easily be imagined. Tang Yuan\u2019s father and grandfather had blown into a rage. Then, Tang Yuan had shown them the cup with the remnants of the drugged tea. The Tang family pharmacist had checked the cup, and proved the authenticity of Tang Yuan\u2019s story.The Li and Meng families were savages. They intended to bring a bad name to the Tang family and destroy its reputation. The family\u2019s reputation was the most important thing in the eyes of the Old Tang. Therefore, he couldn\u2019t take this matter for granted.Grandpa Tang had been so furious that he had lifted Tang Yuan\u2019s fat body in the air, and had shouted at him in an ear-piercing voice. He had then thrown him to the ground, and had urged him to take him to the Li and Meng families in order to seek justice for his family.Grandpa Tang was even older than Grandpa Jun. He was so old that he had been titled as a minster of three Emperors. He had been keeping to himself since the past few years, and hadn\u2019t been stepping out of his house. But now, he was advancing towards the Li and Meng residences with an entourage of warriors behind him. This meant that the Li and Meng families were bound to face a storm.Grandpa Jun hadn\u2019t been furious even though he had been cursed by Tang Wanli. In fact, he had been comforted by the fact that the Li and Meng families were about to face the rage of Old Tang. Jun Zhan Tian was sure that this entire mess had been created by Tang Yuan. [Thankfully, Jun Mo Xie has been obedient in the past few days. He has been studying literature and poetry in the library. Thanks to that\u2026 I\u2019ve got rid of so many of my worries. But, Old Tang still has to do so much for the sake of his grandson at his age. It\u2019s so pitiful.]Grandpa Jun had been tempted to provoke Old Tang even further after seeing that pitiful look on his face. How could he have known that the grandson he was so proud of had taken money for gambling in his absence? Grandpa Jun was shocked when he came to know about it. It wasn\u2019t a big deal to lose money. But, if something else had happened\u2026 then its outcome would\u2019ve been serious.Grandpa Jun rushed towards his grandson\u2019s room as soon he got the news that he was back. However, he was shocked to open his door. He saw a huge bag full of extraordinary treasures placed on Jun Mo Xie\u2019s bed. Little Ke was squinting her eyes and smiling. She moved her fingers as she tried to evaluate the value of each of the items.Grandpa Jun was stunned as he examined the treasures. Besides other things, the bag contained at least three accompaniment jades whose surface was exuding a warm radiance. Anyone could tell that these weren\u2019t ordinary objects. However, Grandpa Jun wasn\u2019t shocked about the value of these assets. Instead, he had been stunned to read the inscription on the surface of the jade \u2013\u2018Year X Month X\u2026 Congratulations on Grandson Feng\u2019s Birthday\u2019 and \u2018Year X Month X\u2026 Congratulations on Grandson Zhen\u2019s Birthday\u2019\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGrandpa Jun was alarmed. He started to fiddle with his beard. [Isn\u2019t this accompaniment jade supposed to be worn by the direct descendants of the Li family? The quality of this jade suggests that it\u2019s a symbol of the Li family. Moreover, Feng and Zhen are the names of the grandsons of the Grand Preceptor Li. How did these items ended-up in Mo Xie\u2019s hands? Can it be that my grandson has started to rob people?]Suddenly, Grandpa Jun exerted excessive force and pulled out a strand of hair from his beard. [These two jade ruyi certainly belong to the royal families. There\u2019s also the Meng family\u2019s accompaniment jade\u2026 and this pearl\u2026 and this\u2026]Grandpa Jun\u2019s face twitched as he asked, \u201cFrom where did you get all these items?\u201d Grandpa Jun was certain that he had been stuck in a big problem if Jun Mo Xie had indeed stolen those items.It couldn\u2019t be said that Grandpa Jun was pessimistic in not believing in his grandson\u2019s capabilities for winning these items in a gamble. However, he was a realist. He knew his grandson and his capabilities. So, he was sure that Jun Mo Xie couldn\u2019t have won these items.It was an irony that he had laughed at the condition of Old Tang a short while ago. How could he have known that a problem like this was awaiting him at his home? Grandpa Jun was so shocked that he had been rendered speechless.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She was shocked. However, she quickly regained her composure, and kneeled down in salutation. She then said, \u201cThese treasures were won by the Young Master in gambling.\u201d\u201cHe won these treasures? He won?\u201d Grandpa Jun said in a surprised tone. He would\u2019ve shouted out these words if he had been alone. However, there was still a trace of suspicion in his mind. [When did this wastrel start to win money? He has never won a single liang since the time he has started to gamble.] The entire Jun estate would\u2019ve been gambled away by Jun Mo Xie if Grandpa Jun hadn\u2019t limited the money that he could gamble to his pocket-money. But now, Jun Mo Xie had won treasures like these\u2026\u201cI\u2019m saying the truth. These treasures have been won by the Young Master. This maid can never dare to lie in front of you. Young Master has also won three-million liang in silver bills. I think he has won all this from Young Master Li and Young Master Meng. The Young Master asked me to arrange this treasure before he left for the library,\u201d Little Ke replied without any hesitation.Little Ke was filled with pride since Jun Mo Xie had never won anything before. And now, he had won these extraordinary treasures. Jun Mo Xie had become extremely capable in her eyes all of a sudden. She was still a little scared of her master. However, she now felt that there was a change in his personality. He was at least not as abhorrent as before.\u201cThat wastrel went to the library again?\u201d Grandpa Jun was pleasantly surprised. He wasn\u2019t only happy that he won\u2019t have to deal with a new problem, but also that his grandson had gone to the library. He looked ahead with blank eyes. He couldn\u2019t handle the overwhelming emotions. He felt his forehead with trembling hands to make sure that he wasn\u2019t suffering from a fever. He then checked his ears to make sure that he had heard everything right. After that, he felt a little relieved.\u201cAlright. Tell him to come and meet me once he\u2019s back.\u201d Then, Grandpa Jun left the room along with the housekeeper Old Pang. Little Ke was once again left alone with the money. She continued to calculate the value of the treasures, \u201cThese accompaniment jades can be sold for at least one-hundred-thousand liang\u2026 this bead and this gemstone can be sold for at least a hundred-fifty-thousand liang\u2026 and that\u2026 along with these silver bills\u2026 wow\u2026\u201dJun Zhan Tian seemed confused. \u201cWhat do you think, Old Pang?\u201d He had been unable to understand the change that had taken place in his grandson\u2019s personality during the past month. What was his grandson planning? What was he doing?\u201cI don\u2019t know anything except that the changes in Young Master\u2019s personality are extremely positive.\u201d Old Pang also looked confused. However, it was a good thing that Grandpa Jun wasn\u2019t supposed to deal with any kind of mess on account of Jun Mo Xie.\u201cMo Xie really seems interested in reading. What do you think \u2013 should I send him to the Weng Xing Institute of Knowledge?\u201d Grandpa Jun asked with a hopeful expression on his face. Weng Xing Institute of Knowledge was the leading place of learning for the scholars of the kingdom. The combined number of teachers and students in the institute were less than a thousand. This number was very small if the population of hundreds of millions of people in the Tian Xiang kingdom was taken into account. This meant that only the people with high talent and accomplishments were qualified to enter this place. The kingdom employed these students as soon as they completed their graduation. However, the students in this institute were made to undergo great challenges in order to complete their graduation.The Weng Xing Institute of knowledge could be termed as a golden road for the scholars of the kingdom.Not even a prince or a princess was allowed to enter the Weng Xing Insitute of Knowledge if they didn\u2019t possess the required talent.Therefore, Grandpa Jun truly believed that Jun Mo Xie had become a new person as he was planning to send him to the Weng Xing Institute.\u201cI think it would be quite difficult.\u201d [How can Jun Mo Xie enter into the Weng Xing Institute of Knowledge? All the people who have been accepted in the institute in the past had studied for several years. The people who are qualified to enter this institute are the most recognized geniuses. So, how can Jun Mo Xie enter the institute after reading for a month?]Old Pang couldn\u2019t answer Grandpa Jun\u2019s question in a straightforward manner. So, he continued to speak, \u201cThe Weng Xing Institute is too pedantic for the Young Master. What if he goes there and faces obstacles? I think we should wait and observe for some more time.\u201d\u201cHmmm\u2026 It\u2019s so unfortunate that Mo Xie\u2019s level of Xuan Qi cultivation is mediocre. It would\u2019ve been great if he could enter into the Divine Xuan Institute of War. Every generation of the Jun family has fought wars and become generals. Wouldn\u2019t it have been remarkable if our family had also produced a pedantic man?\u201d Jun Zhan Tian realized that this matter wasn\u2019t easy to deal with. Even the Emperor had to endure Grandpa Jun\u2019s anger when the Second Prince was entering the Weng Xing Institute of Knowledge. Grandpa Jun had always been at variance with scholars.Moreover, Jun Mo Xie\u2019s personality\u2026\u201cOld Pang, what are your thoughts on this matter? What should I plan for Mo Xie\u2019s future? Should I send him to study? But, I don\u2019t think that my grandson has been designed for something like that. Should I get him trained in the military? But, he isn\u2019t designed for that either. He can neither endure pain nor training. Should I send him to do business? But, I\u2019m afraid that he\u2019ll lose money to the extent of being unable to buy a coffin for me. Am I left with no other choice than to leave him as a wastrel waiting for his death?\u201d Grandpa Jun sighed and said.Old Pang seemed to have become frustrated. He tried to comfort Jun Zhan Tian and replied, \u201cThere have been changes in Young Master\u2019s personality recently. It seems that he\u2019s himself trying to achieve something\u2026 and become a new person. He\u2019s still quite young. I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s too late for anything.\u201d\u201cI hate this kind of a hypocritical comfort. And\u2026 you\u2019re getting quite good at it. Old Pang, this can\u2019t be you. Where\u2019s that Pang Lie who fought against tens of thousands of men on the battlefield?\u201d Jun Zhan Tian frowned and said.Old Pang smiled bitterly. [I didn\u2019t want to say those words. But, what else could I have said? Was I supposed to say that every grandson brings food fortune with him\u2026 but you can\u2019t count on your grandson? Should I have said that your grandson is a smear on a wall who can\u2019t be developed in any manner? Or that your grandson won\u2019t stop before he ruins himself completely; irrespective of your efforts and worries\u2026 Was I supposed to tell you that? It would\u2019ve been better if I had asked you to behead me.]Suddenly, Old Pang recalled something. He said, \u201cThe Young Master can be saved in one way. Then, the Senior Master won\u2019t have to worry about him.\u201d\u201cWhat way? Come on\u2026 tell me quickly!\u201d Jun Zhan Tian was surprised. He was only trying to vent out his anger. He hadn\u2019t expected that Old Pang would really have a way to protect Jun Mo Xie.Old Pang said in a hesitant manner, \u201cThis way is quite difficult to implement. I think that we should buy a young Xuan Beast of the eighth level or above\u2026 Then, we should train it\u2026\u201d\u201cStop this nonsense! Are you sleep-talking, Old Tang? Do you really think that this way is possible?\u201d Jun Zhan Tian interrupted Old Pang and shouted.Old Pang pondered for a while. He then said, \u201cImpossible!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euJun Zhan Tian sighed and said, \u201cThen, why are you talking about it?\u201dXuan Beasts were a special kind of a life force in the Xuan Xuan continent. A high level Xuan Beast possessed great strength. It was believed that an eighth level Xuan Beast could fight fairly with a Sky Xuan Expert. Moreover, a ninth level Xuan Beast was as powerful as a Spirit Xuan Expert.These Xuan Beasts had their own hierarchy\u2026 just like humans. In fact, their ranks were even more rigid than humans. A specially-skilled human could challenge and defeat an opponent whose Xuan Qi cultivation was higher than his own. However, this wasn\u2019t the case with Xuan Beasts.Xuan Beasts of the fourth level and below could easily be compared with wild animals. In fact, their destructive powers were only marginally more than that of normal animals. The Xuan Beasts started to possess some special kinds of skills only from the fifth level and above. However, the Xuan Beasts of sixth and seventh level weren\u2019t that useful; especially when they were young. In addition, a Xuan Beast couldn\u2019t be tamed once it reached adulthood. A few Xuan Beasts took decades to reach adulthood; while a few took as long as hundred years! What was the point of waiting for a cub to mature for such a long period of time? Moreover, a sixth level Xuan Beast was as powerful as a Silver level Xuan Qi Expert. Therefore, this kind of a Xuan Beast was easier to find, and its price wasn\u2019t too high.However, the Xuan Beast of the seventh level onwards possessed the innate quality to breakthrough. These Xuan Beasts were believed to give a competition to humans in terms of their wisdom. They also possessed an additional ability which made the development process of their cubs extremely difficult.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This crystal was known as the Xuan Core. The Xuan Beasts of the seventh level possessed special abilities to absorb the Xuan energies from the other life-forms. This ability helped them in increasing their rate of growth.Therefore, the cubs of the Xuan Beasts of the seventh level were extremely rare. Moreover, the prices of the ones that were available were excessively high. Naturally, the cubs of the Xuan Beasts of the eighth level were priceless. Only legends could get access to them\u2026No one had been heard to have possessed a Xuan Beast of the eighth level in the past few decades.The high-level Xuan Beasts resided deep within the Tian Fa Forest. The Tian Fa Forest was an extremely dangerous place; so much so that even a Spirit Xuan Expert couldn\u2019t dare to enter the place. The Tian Fa Forest was wide in its area; its realm had no bounds. In fact, it covered a quarter of the land of the entire continent. The animals found on the periphery of the forest were low-level Xuan Beasts and a few species of ordinary animals. However, it got extremely risky if one was to delve deeper into the forest. Moreover, a high-level Xuan Beast ran away as soon as it found itself unmatched. It was impossible for anyone to chase after these Beasts in the Tian Fa Forest. In addition, it was impossible for a person with limited strength to make his way out of the forest.It took at least three Sky Xuan Experts to catch a cub of a Xuan Beast of the eighth level. A minimum of three Sky Xuan Experts could deal with two adult Xuan Beasts of the eighth level; that too with great difficulty. Moreover, the defensive capabilities of the Xuan Beasts were stronger than that of a Sky Xuan Expert. It was impossible to imagine the outcome of a situation if the Sky Xuan Experts were to come across a group of Xuan Beasts of the eighth level. Even a Spirit Xuan Expert would end-up getting buried on the spot if that were to happen.Only the powerful experts with precious identities attained a Sky Xuan rank. These experts possessed great wealth. Then, why would a Sky Xuan expert risk his life in order to catch a Xuan Beast of the eighth level?Therefore, Grandpa Jun smiled bitterly as he heard Old Pang\u2019s suggestion.Jun Zhan Tian felt that his grandson was undergoing strange changes in his personality. He said, \u201cLet\u2019s go to the library\u2026 and see what this wastrel is up to\u2026\u201d Then, both of them started to walk towards the library building.However, they didn\u2019t find anyone in the library; it was empty!The bodyguard assigned to watch over the library building reported, \u201cThe Young Master left the library building a couple of hours ago. I don\u2019t know where he\u2019s gone.\u201dJun Zhan Tian and Old Pang looked at each other.Grandpa Jun was tired after walking for such a long distance. He said in a melancholic tone, \u201cLet\u2019s go to my study room.\u201d He then started to walk towards his study room, \u201cBring all the books that he has been checking out.\u201dMeanwhile, Tang Wan Li had been leading his men towards the Li and Meng residences\u2026Li You Ran was dressed in a pure white robe. He stood under a peony tree in the courtyard of the Li family residence. He was looking into the distant dark sky with a shallow smile on his face.Li You Ran\u2019s clothes were blown in the air by a sudden gust of wind; his persona looked like that of a jade tree. This sight would\u2019ve filled anyone\u2019s heart with admiration for him. Li You Ran\u2019s personality was truly unique.Li Feng and his two brothers stood in front of Li You Ran. Their faces were dripping with sweat even though it was the pleasant autumn season. The sweat dripped from their forehead onto their eyebrows and got into their eyes. The three of them were hugely discomforted by this. However, they didn\u2019t dare to wipe-off the sweat from their faces.\u201cWhatever you\u2019ve said isn\u2019t related to this matter. So, let\u2019s end this discussion. Let\u2019s assume that today was Jun Mo Xie\u2019s lucky day. As far as you guys are concerned\u2026\u201d The three of them trembled as they heard Li You Ran\u2019s words. They were extremely scared of Li You Ran even though they belonged to the same generation. No one had ever seen Li You Ran getting angry. However, his mere presence scared the three of them to the depth of their bones.\u201cEach of you will get forty disciplinary beatings\u2026 and your expenses will be deducted by half a year\u2019s worth,\u201d Li You Ran smiled and said while looking into the distance. He then said in a soft tone, \u201cTomorrow\u2026 continue with the things that you\u2019re supposed to do\u2026 understand?\u201dThis punishment was clearly harsh; especially when it had been granted to one\u2019s close cousins. The forty disciplinary beating would\u2019ve torn-off a layer of their skin even if it wouldn\u2019t break their bones and snap their muscles. Moreover, they were supposed to stick to their plan the next day. Li You Ran had punished them with a calm voice with an indifferent expression in his eyes. It seemed as if he was dealing with dogs; not humans.However, Li Feng and his brothers thanked Li You Ran repeatedly. They had accepted the punishment\u2026 as if they had been granted amnesty. They felt that they had been granted with a light punishment in the light of what they had done.\u201cJun Mo Xie\u2026 hehehehe\u2026\u201d Li You Ran smiled and said in a light tone. \u201cYou guys can now leave.\u201d The three brother departed as they heard these words. They walked in a submissive manner with a blessed expression on their faces.Li You Ran then clapped his hands and ordered, \u201cCome here!\u201d Suddenly, a couple of black-robed figures appeared by his side. They bowed down as an indication to receive further orders.\u201cGo and find out how Jun Mo Xie won the game today. I also want to know why the drugs didn\u2019t have any effect on Jun Mo Xie. Also, find out if Dugu Xiao Yi\u2019s presence in the Thousand Gold Hall was a coincidence or on purpose. Jun Mo Xie shouldn\u2019t have won the game even if Dugu Xiao Yi was there. Let me know when you get all this information,\u201d Li You Ran said in a soft tone; it seemed as if he didn\u2019t want to spend too much of his energy in speaking.\u201cSure!\u201d the black-robed figures saluted and replied. Both the figures then turned around to see a green-robed person entering the courtyard; he was panting. The person slowed down and tried to normalize his breathing as he saw Li You Ran. However, his face was still red. \u201cReporting to the Young Master: Tang Wan Li \u2013 The Tang Family Duke is advancing towards the Li residence with Young Master Tang Yuan and hundreds of soldiers. His mannerisms suggest that he\u2019s extremely angry.\u201dLi You Ran raised his eyebrows and said, \u201cOh! So, they want to give us some trouble. I didn\u2019t expect Tang Yuan to possess this level of deceit. I guess that I\u2019ll have to make a few changes in my plan\u2026 hehehe\u2026 Go and inform Li Feng and his brothers. Tell them to say this if Tang Wan Li questions them about the matter. Also, make sure that the disciplinary punishment is executed immediately. Don\u2019t let Wan Li Tang question them until half of the punishment has been executed.\u201d One of the black-robed figure nodded and left the courtyard.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSuddenly, Li You Ran turned around and said with a smile, \u201cIs there any man among the people accompanying Tang Wan Li on whom we\u2019ve been keeping an eye?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 three men\u2026\u201d the green-robed man said without any hesitation.Li You Ran said with a smile, \u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d He then raised his head and looked at the clouds in the sky. The warm autumn weather was now mixed with a cool breeze of air. Li You Ran muttered, \u201cIt\u2019s about to rain. The Tang family\u2019s elites have now moved out. So, this is a good opportunity.\u201d Li You Ran said carefully, \u201cNotify Qin Hu to make use of this opportunity. The Tang forces have moved out. So, he must obtain the item that I had asked him to obtain earlier from the Tang residence. He should be successful in this endeavour. He\u2019s not allowed to fail. We\u2019ll not get this opportunity again. Tell him that he has the entire afternoon to execute this.\u201cAlso\u2026 inform him to use those that have never appeared in public before. They must not leave any trace; whether they succeed or fail.\u201d\u201cSure!\u201d The other black-robed figure saluted and left the courtyard.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You\u2019ve done well this time.\u201dThe green-robed man became excited as he heard these words. It seemed as if he felt that he had received a huge compliment. He clenched his fists and replied, \u201cThis subordinate will be back.\u201dLi You Ran nodded with a calm expression on his face. The green-robed man walked ten steps backwards and turned around. Then, he departed with huge strides. After that, he finally heaved a sigh of relief. He didn\u2019t even dare to breathe properly in front of the Young Master.Li You Ran smiled as his dark hair was blown by a breeze of cool air. \u201cMy grandfather is in the palace with the Majesty. Go and inform him that Tang Wan Li has arrived at our residence with a group of experts. But, ask him not to worry. It\u2019s a great opportunity for us\u2026 even though it\u2019s not a good sign. But, everything has its pros and cons. What matters is whether or not we can take advantage of this situation.\u201dAn affirmative sound rang out in the darkness. The person then departed at a fast speed.\u201cJun Mo Xie escaped this time. So, the Jun family has the fortune of keeping out of this situation. But, the Meng family will be forced into an extremely difficult situation if the Old Duke Tang causes any problem. Then, grandfather will need to act\u2026 so that the Tang and Meng families become enemies. We can bring the Meng family on our side. We may even convince them to submit. As far as the Jun family is concerned\u2026 it won\u2019t be difficult to make plans to deal with them as Jun Mo Xie is the sole successor of the family. But, we can\u2019t make a move against the Dugu family. We\u2019re not in a position to\u2026\u201dLi You Ran sighed. He then stretched out his white hand and plucked a leaf from the peony tree. It seemed as if he was scared of disturbing the tranquillity of the tree. After that, he lowered his head and looked at the leaf, \u201cBut still\u2026 it isn\u2019t that bad. At least\u2026 it\u2019s interesting.\u201dHe could now hear the thundering sound of the hooves of the horses. The sound slowly came closer and stopped at the doors of the Li residence.Li You Ran smiled and ordered, \u201cOpen the doors\u2026 and greet the Old Duke with utmost courtesy.\u201dLi You Ran flicked his fingers. Suddenly, his body flashed in a yellow glow. Then, the leaf blew out of his hand with a yellow glow and attached itself to the trunk of the peony tree\u2026A bolt of lightning flashed in the sky at the same time. The clouds bellowed, and a fearsome wind started to blow.Suddenly, Li You Ran\u2019s robe was swept upwards by the violent wind. Then, his body disappeared from the courtyard.*** ***Where did Jun Mo Xie go?Grandpa Jun couldn\u2019t imagine that Jun Mo Xie could ever set his foot in that place. Jun Mo Xie had received severe beating \u2013 not once but twice \u2013 in that place. The beatings had been so severe that Jun Mo Xie hadn\u2019t been able to leave his bed for a fortnight in both the instances. These were the only two times that Jun Mo Xie had received beatings in his family.This place was the courtyard of Jun Mo Xie\u2019s third uncle \u2013 Jun Wu Yi.Jun Wu Yi had dedicated his entire life to the military. Even his house was located close to the military training ground.Jun Wu Yi sat quietly in his wheelchair. He looked across the flower garden and stared at the bodyguards of the Jun family exercising in the training ground. His expressions changed. It seemed that his desire to be a warrior once again had been rekindled.Jun Xie squatted in front of him. He was practising the mysterious Fortune Art while inspecting Jun Wu Yi\u2019s legs. He checked his legs repeatedly from top-to-bottom. He carefully checked every tendon and fibre of his muscles.Jun Xie\u2019s body didn\u2019t possess any internal energy a month ago. Therefore, it hadn\u2019t been possible for him to check the condition of Jun Wu Yi\u2019s legs earlier. Now, he possessed the internal energy known as the \u2018First Eternal Art\u2019 of the Art of Unlocking Heaven\u2019s Fortune. Jun Xie wanted to check as many times as possible in order to decide the method of treatment.Jun Xie stopped checking his legs after a long while. Sweat was dripping down from his face. He stood-up with bright eyes.\u201cWhat\u2019s the condition?\u201d Jun Wu Yi asked in a light tone. It seemed as if he was indifferent to the outcome. However, he had clenched his fists tightly; so much so that the veins on the back of his hands were throbbing in a consistent manner. He couldn\u2019t remain calm; no matter how hard he tried.He had noticed Jun Xie\u2019s bright eyes. However, he couldn\u2019t convince himself that there was hope for his legs that had been paralyzed for so long.Jun Xie was his last and only hope.He couldn\u2019t even dare to ask if he could be cured or not. He had simply asked about the condition of his legs.He desperately wanted to hear a positive reply from Jun Xie.Jun Xie smiled and answered, \u201cThe condition of your legs isn\u2019t very positive\u2026 but it can\u2019t be considered to be negative either. It\u2019ll take a lot of effort\u2026 but I think you may be able to stand up again.\u201d\u201cExcellent!\u201d Jun Wu Yi couldn\u2019t contain his excitement any longer. However, there was still a trace of disbelief in his mind. After all, all the renowned doctors had lost hope in him. It was true that this wastrel of his nephew had been acting a bit strange off-lately. But, how did he possess the ability to cure his disability? However, Jun Wu Yi couldn\u2019t even let go of the slightest opportunity. He would \u2013 at the most \u2013 be disappointed once again even if his nephew was bragging. No one else could understand the Third Master\u2019s frame of mind.\u201cI\u2019ll make a list of the necessary herbs. Third Uncle will need to make arrangements to procure these herbs. I think that Third Uncle will be able to stand-up soon as long as these herbs are obtained,\u201d Jun Xie said.\u201cAlright! What are the names of these herbs? Are they rare and expensive? I\u2019ll send my men to procure them as soon as possible,\u201d Jun Wu Yi said in an apprehensive manner.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIntestinal Cracker Flower, Common Heart Grass, Nine Leaf Grass, Persistent Severing Root and Blazing Meridian Lotus,\u201d Jun Xie stated the names of the five herbs in a single breath. Jun Xie had stated the names of the herbs in the language of his present world. He had been searching through the books in order to find out the names that were used for the herbs in his present world from the past few days. These herbs were obviously known by different names in his past life. Fortunately, there was a huge collection of medicinal books in the library. Jun Xie had identified these herbs by their medicinal value.\u201cI\u2019ve heard the names of Intestinal Cracker Flower, Common Heart Grass and Persistent Severing Root. But, what kind of herbs are the Nine Leaf Grass and Blazing Meridian Lotus?\u201d Jun Wu Yi asked in a gloomy tone. He had been trying to find a cure for his disability for a very long time. Therefore, he had become an expert on medicines. However, he hadn\u2019t heard the names of the two herbs stated by Jun Xie. But, he was more surprised by the fact that his nephew knew about those herbs.Jun Xie smiled and took out a book from his bosom. He then opened a page and showed a picture of two plants to Jun Wu Yi. \u201cThis is the Nine Leaf Grass and this is the Blazing Meridian Lotus. This Blazing Meridian Lotus herb is the rarest in the list of the herbs that I\u2019ve provided. The rest of the herbs are quite common\u2026 and can be easily found in our medical warehouse. They can also be found in the medical shops in the city.\u201d\u201cGreat!\u201d Jun Wu Yi replied in a trembling voice. His eyes were fixed on the pictures of the herbs in the book.Jun Wu Yi had finally become hopeful about his condition after a period of ten years.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If these herbs aren\u2019t available there\u2026 then we must be extra cautious about the ways to obtain these herbs. No one should know the reason for why we\u2019re trying to procure these herbs. So, don\u2019t send a single person to buy all the herbs. In fact, make different people in-charge for buying different herbs. Not only should we remove all possibilities of people knowing about the combined result of these herbs\u2026 but also the probability of doubts in anyone\u2019s mind. Moreover, I\u2019ll check all the herbs personally after they\u2019ve been procured\u2026 before using them for your treatment,\u201d Jun Xie said.He then added, \u201cThe condition of our Jun family isn\u2019t great these days. But, I\u2019m sure that there\u2019ll be a huge change if Third Uncle\u2019s body is fully restored. I\u2019m aware that there are many people who don\u2019t want Third Uncle to ever stand on his feet again. So, we need to maintain utmost secrecy about this entire matter. Third Uncle will turn out to be a hidden card in the fortune of our Jun family. I hope you understand what I\u2019m saying.\u201dJun Wu Yi looked at Jun Xie with a pleasant expression on his face and said, \u201cWhat you\u2019re saying is absolutely true. Mo Xie, you\u2019ve grown up. Now, I\u2019m sure that the Jun family will be saved even if I\u2019m not cured.\u201d Jun Wu Yi seemed to be in high spirits after listening to Jun Xie\u2019s words. He was glad to see his once useless nephew planning for the future in such detail.Jun Xie turned his head to the other side, and let out a soft chuckle. It was a different feeling to hear words like \u2018you\u2019ve grown up\u2019 when one had once been an ace assassin.In fact, Jun Xie was embarrassed.Jun Xie didn\u2019t consider himself to be worthy of these praising words. Thankfully, Jun Wu Yi had said \u2013\u2018Mo Xie, you\u2019ve grown up\u2019. Jun Xie would\u2019ve lost his face if Jun Wu Yi had used \u2018Jun Xie\u2019 in place of \u2018Mo Xie\u2019.A person from Jun Xie\u2019s past life would\u2019ve choked to death if he or she had heard these words in his praise.Suddenly, Jun Wu Yi started to feel a sense of restlessness as he heard the distant roars of the house-guards while training. He hadn\u2019t felt like this in ages. He said, \u201cMo Xie, what do you think about the training of our house-guards?\u201dJun Xie\u2019s chain of thoughts was broken as he heard this question. \u201cAll style\u2026 and no substance,\u201d he replied without hesitation. He didn\u2019t even try to hide the tone of disgust in his voice.Jun Wu Yi laughed out loud as he heard this. He then shook his head and said, \u201cYou find the training undergone by our house-guards with cultivation of Seventh or Eighth level Xuan Qi to be just style and no substance?! Mo Xie, your point-of-view is truly something.\u201dJun Xie replied, \u201cThis can\u2019t be counted as a training. Are these exercises even going to have any positive effect on our guards? It\u2019s just an exercise regime; nothing else. How can you even think that an effective training session can look like this? This is just a gathering of people who\u2019ve come together to tone-up their bodies. Oh no\u2026 actually\u2026 these exercises are not even good enough to tone-up their bodies. I wonder in what manner are these exercises going to help them in the battlefield. In fact, I doubt if our guards will be able to deal with our enemies\u2026 I don\u2019t see any difference between these guards and a bunch of ordinary people. They\u2019re useless people who are wasting time, effort and money in useless exercises.\u201dJun Wu Yi couldn\u2019t contain his anger on hearing these words. He raised his eyebrows and shouted, \u201cUseless people? Useless exercises? Mo Xie, you don\u2019t even practice martial arts. Then, how will you understand the relevance of basic training? But still, you\u2019ve no right to insult these people. It\u2019s alright to be ignorant. But, it doesn\u2019t put you in a position to humiliate someone. All these people are elite war veterans. They\u2019ve fought in over a hundred wars. They\u2019ve only become guards as they\u2019re no ongoing wars right now. Each one of them has proven himself time and again. Mo Xie, I\u2019m taking your ignorant words as a causal joke. But, don\u2019t repeat them ever again. Or else\u2026 I shouldn\u2019t be blamed for being unkind to you. No one should ever even joke about these matters.\u201dSuddenly, Jun Wu Yi felt an awe-inspiring aura around him. Even Jun Xie seemed stunned. Jun Wu Yi\u2019s persona was extremely powerful even though his body had been paralysed. There was no doubt that he would become a strong pillar of support for the Jun family if he stood on his feet again.\u201cA joke?! No, Third Uncle. You didn\u2019t understand what I was saying. I was only stating the truth,\u201d Jun Xie stretched his arms and said in an innocent manner.He then continued, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to humiliate them or call them \u2018useless\u2019. I truly believe anyone who has withstood a war and has returned victorious is worthy of being considered as an iron-blooded hero. I didn\u2019t mean to question their dedication towards their workouts either. But still, it doesn\u2019t mean that these exercises can help them win a war. In fact, it\u2019s possible that they\u2019ll die the moment they step into a battlefield. What I meant was that the manner in which they\u2019re training is incorrect.\u201dJun Wu Yi still seemed furious. However, he had started to grasp the meaning behind Jun Xie\u2019s words, \u201cThe manner of their training is incorrect?\u201d He knew that his nephew had changed a lot in the past few days. Off lately, each and every word of his contained some meaning behind them. [Can it be\u2026]Jun Xie raised his finger and pointed it towards two guards. He then said, \u201cTake these fighting guards for instance\u2026 What do you think? They\u2019re fighting or playing with each other? There\u2019s a certain reservation in their movements while attacking each other. Even their faces have traces of smile on them. Hehehe\u2026 how can this even fall in the category of training? Even children aren\u2019t trained in this manner. They\u2019re simply having fun. Is this not only style and no substance? Now, look there. These men are lifting logs. They\u2019re getting drenched in sweat even before putting the logs down. It seems to be quite difficult, but it\u2019s useless. These guards aren\u2019t utilizing their entire strength in lifting these logs even though they possess great strength. They put down the logs as soon as they start shedding sweat. So, they\u2019re left with plenty of energy to spare. If they continue to train in this manner\u2026 then there\u2019ll be no improvement in their physical strength even if they practice for ten years. They\u2019re becoming more proficient in what they already know. But, their dormant skills aren\u2019t getting highlighted. That\u2019s why I said that they\u2019re useless exercises.\u201dJun Xie then glared at the guards in a cold manner and said, \u201cThese people can survive in the battlefield on the basis of only their luck. They become heroes and great warriors owing to fortunate accidents. These men can only be assigned to guard our houses. They can\u2019t be entrusted with higher responsibilities. Third Uncle, do you still think that I was trying to humiliate them?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euJun Wu Yi didn\u2019t become angry after hearing Jun Xie\u2019s blunt and rude remarks. Instead, he seemed to be lost in thoughts.Jun Xie laughed out loud and said, \u201cThe Jun family would\u2019ve been completely destroyed by now if Grandpa Jun had depended on these men for the safety of this family. I\u2019m sure that there\u2019s another group of elite soldiers which is the real strength of our Jun family. I\u2019ve never seen or heard them. But still, I know that they exist. These people are only meant for display. Third Uncle, are you trying to tell me that you hold these people \u2013 who are meant to be used as a display \u2013 in high regard?\u201dJun Wu Yi looked at Jun Xie with a strange expression on his face. He remained silent for a long while. He then said, \u201cWhat if I put these men under your command? What kind of skills will they acquire under your training?\u201dJun Xie curled his lips and said, \u201cPut them under my command?! Third Uncle, I don\u2019t have that much free time to spare. I\u2019ll die if I\u2019ve to smell the odor of their sweat on a daily basis. The odor of sweat is in no way similar to the sweet smell of warriors. The spirit of military doesn\u2019t lie in shouts and sweat; it lies in killing the maximum number of people in the battlefield.\u201dSuddenly, Jun Wu Yi issued a \u2018heng\u2019 sound. His face looked pensive and firm. He then said, \u201cTake me over there. Jun Mo Xie, show me your real prowess.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Jun Wu Yi coughed and ordered in a loud voice, \u201cAll the military units assemble and line-up before me!\u201dJu Wu Yi had issued a military order after a span of ten years. However, a killing aura and a commendable force had been displayed from his voice and tone. It seemed as if Jun Wu Yi had regained his earlier temperament of a great general. He looked as if he had regained his old persona of a man who held the lives of several people in his hands.The guards felt a sense of extreme fear as they heard the order. They knew that they\u2019d lose their heads if they didn\u2019t follow Jun Wu Yi\u2019s order.Around three-hundred guards had assembled in front of Jun Wu Yi and Jun Xie in a flash.Jun Wu Yi nodded with satisfaction as he saw their hard and sweaty faces. He then pointed at Jun Xie and said, \u201cThird Young Master Jun will be responsible for your training from this moment onwards. You must follow all his orders; no matter what they are. Is this clear?\u201dThe guards started to talk among themselves loudly as they heard this. However, none of them answered.Jun Wu Yi had an angry expression on his face. He looked at Jun Xie, but didn\u2019t say anything. According to his own words, Jun Mo Xie was now the highest ranking officer in the ground. He had assumed that position the moment Jun Wu Yi had uttered those words. In fact, Jun Mo Xie was responsible for what the guards did from now onwards.Jun Wu Yi wasn\u2019t even supposed to interfere in Jun Mo Xie\u2019s ways of training the guards. Jun Wu Yi would assume that Jun Mo Xie was just boasting if he wasn\u2019t successful in passing this test. Then, Jun Wu Yi would give up all the hopes that he had in Jun Mo Xie.Jun Xie laughed secretly. He then stepped forward and said, \u201cThird Uncle and I were observing your training a while back. Third Uncle had asked my views about your training. He had asked whether I considered you people at par with the elites\u2026 hehehe\u2026\u201dJun Xie was speaking in an extremely soft voice. However, he had been successful in gaining the attention of all the guards. They were staring at Jun Xie with glazing eyes. What would they possibly be thinking about such a useless person?Jun Xie continued to speak, \u201cI told him that all of you are a bunch of useless people\u2026 that you people are here only to eat and waste food\u2026 and are just waiting for the death\u2019s call. I also told him that all of you would certainly die if a war was to break out\u2026 and you people were sent to take part in it. I\u2019m quite sure that I\u2019ve spoken only the truth.\u201dThe guards started at Jun Xie with anger in their eyes. Their faces turned red. They inhaled deep breaths. They had been put through an ultimate humiliation.One of them stepped forward. His face was red with anger. He said, \u201cThird Young Master, what do you mean by that? All of us may be the house guards of the Jun family\u2026 but each one of us has survived over a hundred wars. You\u2019re our Master. But still, you\u2019ve no right to insult us in this manner.\u201dJun Xie waved his index finger in front of him and said, \u201cI insulted you?! No\u2026 no\u2026 If anyone\u2019s insulting you\u2026 that\u2019s you yourself\u2026 I don\u2019t need to insult you any further. Are you feeling angry at me? Do you want to beat me up? Very well then\u2026 I\u2019ll allow you to beat me up if you can counter my arguments. This is my first order to you. Third Uncle will not interfere in this matter.\u201dThe guards started to discuss among themselves once more.Jun Xie added in a calm manner, \u201cYou all claim to have survived a hundred battles. Fine then\u2026 answer this question of mine \u2013 Do you all agree that there are people who had joined the military with you\u2026 and had now been promoted to become generals, sergeants etc\u2026 the people who are no longer considered to be regular military soldiers?\u201dThe guards looked at each other and nodded in a hesitant manner. How could Jun Xie\u2019s statement be even considered as an argument? Everyone knew that some people who joined the military became more skilled than other people, and were promoted due to their contributions in the war. Then, why was Jun Xie bringing up this matter?Jun Xie continued to speak, \u201cHave you people ever thought why you didn\u2019t become generals? I\u2019ll tell you. It\u2019s because you people are incapable of that. So, you can\u2019t be compared with those people. You all have suffered elimination.\u201cNow think about the people who joined the military with you. I think that many of those people didn\u2019t have their Xuan Qi cultivation as good as yours. At the most, their Xuan Qi cultivation was at par with yours. Then, why did they become generals and you didn\u2019t?\u201dEveryone was confused after hearing Jun Xie words. [That\u2019s right. Why didn\u2019t we become generals?] They couldn\u2019t help but nodded their heads in unison. Some of them thought, [The people who became general were lucky. They were able to take advantage of the situation. Whatever you\u2019re saying doesn\u2019t make any sense. Why would those people be allowed to serve in the military if they didn\u2019t have enough strength? Wouldn\u2019t those people be asked to become regular soldiers like us if their strength didn\u2019t surpass ours?]Jun Xie then said, \u201cThis is also a fact that several of them were able to break through the bottleneck of the ninth level Xuan Qi during their military tenure\u2026 and even during an ongoing battle. They\u2019ve become a real experts. Many families had become desperate to employ them after the war was over. Am I right?\u201dEveryone nodded their heads as this was a common occurrence. However, they had lost some of their excitement. In fact, a few of them had a glimmer of shame in their eyes. Each of the level of Xuan Qi was a bottleneck. The higher the level \u2013 the more difficult the process of breaking through the bottleneck. The eighth and the ninth level were only one level apart. However, the gap among them was as wide as Heaven and earth. Several people were able to reach the eighth level. However, they became stuck at this level. They couldn\u2019t step into the ninth level even after a lifetime of practice. It was impossible for them to even think about stepping into the higher silver level.The ninth level and below were ants. This sentence wasn\u2019t meant as a joke.Jun Xie looked at the guards with ridicule and said, \u201cThose people were promoted, but you weren\u2019t. You were eliminated in place of those people. Do you agree with me?\u201dEveryone was silent; they couldn\u2019t even move.Jun Xie smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s also true that some of the soldiers wanted to leave the army once the war was over. But, a few soldiers were offered jobs by secretive organizations and private military forces. Some of the soldiers were even transferred to a different unit of the military. Am I right?\u201dJun Xie was right. This was a common occurrence in the kingdom. The guards didn\u2019t say anything. There were traces of shame and contempt on their faces.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euJun Xie continued with his tirade, \u201cBut, you weren\u2019t among the ones who had been transferred. All of you were eliminated for the third time. Then, you became the guards of the Jun family. Does anyone of you remember the original number of people who came here?\u201dThe guards had understood the intention behind Jun Xie\u2019s question. But still, a guard answered in an embarrassed tone, \u201cReporting to the Third Young Master \u2013 the original number was five-hundred men.\u201dJun Xie paused for a moment and said, \u201cNow, there are only three-hundred men. Where did the rest of the two-hundred men go? I\u2019m sure that they were neither killed nor asked to leave. They\u2019ve been selected to serve in a bigger way. But, none of you were selected. It\u2019s clear that you aren\u2019t as capable as them. You faced another round of elimination.\u201dThere was an absolute silence. The eyes of some of the guards had become red. Some of them were breathing heavily. But, no one uttered a single word.Jun Xie turned his head and put his ear before the guards. He then said, \u201cYou all have been eliminated several times.

The faces of all the guards had become red. They were breathless; it seemed as if they were suffocating. They were feeling extremely ashamed of themselves, and were deeply humiliated.[Why did it happen? Why can\u2019t we do it if others can? They could break through to the next level\u2026 but we couldn\u2019t. Why? They had once fought with us. But now, they\u2019re holding positions of authority\u2026 and are looking down upon us. Why can\u2019t we do the same?]Jun Xie said, \u201cA few of you may think that the people who became generals were lucky\u2026 and the ones who managed to advance higher in terms of Xuan Qi cultivation were more talented than you\u2026 that you weren\u2019t selected as the selectors couldn\u2019t recognize your potential. You know what I think about this? I think that all these are petty arguments. If those people were lucky\u2026 then why didn\u2019t you grab on to the same luck? The ones who think that they aren\u2019t as talented as those people have already considered themselves to be a piece of garbage\u2026 And for the ones who think that the selectors couldn\u2019t recognize their talent\u2026 how stupid is that?! What would an employer choose \u2013 talent or a piece of garbage?\u201dStill, no one said anything. The eyes of the guards had become redder. They were breathing more heavily than before.\u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand me. I\u2019m not saying these things to humiliate you\u2026 or to scratch your old wounds. I\u2019m saying this to bring it to your notice that you people have become used to a comfortable life; so much so that you\u2019ve even lost your courage. It isn\u2019t scary to be in the wrong. What\u2019s scary is to not know that one\u2019s in the wrong. It\u2019s unforgivable to be proud of one\u2019s own accomplishments. You people didn\u2019t consider this ever before. You wouldn\u2019t have been here today if this thought had crossed your mind earlier.\u201cPeople can be motivated through various means. But, insult is the most important of them. Now tell me \u2013 do you people want to continue your existence as a piece of garbage? Do you want to continue your existence as useless people who are just waiting for the death\u2019s call? Do you want to continue to be insulted and stepped over by others? Do you want to continue listening to these rude words from me until you\u2019re unable to lift-up your heads in pride again?\u201dSuddenly, a loud voice rang out, \u201cNO!\u201d A few voices could be heard in the beginning in a disorderly manner. However, they continued to rise, and became so loud that they could topple over the mountains. The guards\u2019 emotions had been incited. They were shouting so loudly that their throats were hurting. It seemed as if the blood had surged-up in their heads.Jun Xie walked two steps forward. He then titled his head to one side and said, \u201cVery good! It seems that there\u2019s still hope.\u201d He paused for a moment and added, \u201cDid anyone of you ever thought that what if you\u2019re a bunch of useless people\u2026 you\u2019re still better than a debauchee like me? Is it right? You people know that you\u2019re bound to follow all my orders as per Third Uncle\u2019s instructions, but you hold me in contempt. Is that correct?\u201dSeveral of the guards raised their heads and looked at Jun Xie. They didn\u2019t say anything. But, it was clear that they were indeed feeling this way.Jun Xie stretched out his hands and said, \u201cBut, you people are wrong. This mind set is a big mistake on your part. I\u2019m a known debauchee\u2026 while you people are survivors of a hundred wars. You\u2019re all iron-blooded men. But still, you worth isn\u2019t as much as mine. And why\u2019s that? It\u2019s simple. I\u2019ve a great grandfather and a good uncle\u2026 and had a good father and two good brothers. These people sacrificed everything they had in order to make the Jun family reach the position it has today. You people don\u2019t have all these things. I \u2013 Jun Mo Xie is a debauchee. But still, there\u2019ll always be someone to save me when I do something wrong or even kill innocents. There\u2019ll always be someone to make my life a success. But again, none of you have these things. So, my worth is more than yours. The Laws of Heaven has its own balance. One has to let go of something in order to gain something. Even a debauchee has to pay a price to be a debauchee. Don\u2019t think of it as a small price. In fact, there\u2019s no such thing as a debauchee. The one who can\u2019t fulfil the conditions of being a debauchee is the one whose parents couldn\u2019t afford the price for this. So, none of them could be called a debauchee. That\u2019s the reason they\u2019ll never be called a debauchee.\u201cThere isn\u2019t any need for you to look far for an example. You can find an example right in front of your eyes. My grandfather \u2013 Jun Zhan Tian \u2013 was born as an ordinary person. He entered the military\u2026 and shed his blood in more than a hundred battles in order to bring the Jun family to this place. Do you think that my grandfather was stronger than anyone of you when he started out?\u201dThe story of Jun Zhan Tian\u2019s struggles and rise to fame was a well-known story in the Tian Xiang Kingdom. All these people had heard about his story several times. The eyes of several guards started to emit a spark as they heard these words. The hearts of a few of them had been stirred to such an extent that they started to tremble.[Can we also reach to such a height?]Jun Xie continued to speak, \u201cI\u2019ve said enough. I think you people have got the gist behind my words. You people are lucky enough to survive several wars and make enough contributions to lead this kind of a peaceful life. In fact, you guys have the liberty to treat your training as a game. But, the price that you\u2019re paying is enough to get through life in this manner; nothing more, nothing less.\u201dSuddenly, he stopped walking back-and-forth. He then turned around to face the guards and said in an impactful manner, \u201cNow, I\u2019ve only one question for you\u2026 Do you people want to get out of your comfort zone and become first-class experts? Do you people want to leave behind the people who had once left you behind? Do you people want to handle greater responsibilities than just being guards to the residences of the Jun family? And\u2026\u201dJun Xie paused for a while and continued, \u201c\u2026 do you want to let your children enjoy the same privileges as I do? If you become successful\u2026 then your children can afford to become a useless debauchee as me whom no one can bully. Your success will put your children in a powerful position. Do you realize that your success will enable your children to climb to the top of the ladder without making any effort? Your family can even become as influential as the Jun family, the Li family and the Dugu family. Your efforts and hard work can help transform the luck of your children and grandchildren.\u201dEveryone became excited as they thought of the colorful picture of their bright future painted by Jun Xie. They clenched their fists tightly, and their eyes became red.Suddenly, Jun Xie shouted out, \u201cDo you want it or not? Say yes or no!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d the guards shouted in unison. Their voice was so loud that even the sky shook. It seemed as if the Heaven and the earth had shook together.Jun Xie looked at them coldly and said, \u201cAlright! Now, listen to me carefully. No one\u2019s allowed to complain during my training sessions. You can be assured that your efforts and sacrifices will reap you the greatest profits under my guidance. But, you must also remember this very important fact. A few of you may die under my training\u2026 and a few may end-up getting disabled. You may have to pay this price. So, I\u2019m giving you a chance to reconsider my leadership. Think carefully. Then, who so ever is interested in training under me can take a step forward. The rest of you may remain standing at your place. I\u2019m warning you people again. You can\u2019t quit my leadership once you accept it \u2013 until and unless you die. So, you should make your choice after a careful consideration.\u201dThen, Jun Xie shouted, \u201cI\u2019ll count up to three. You must make up your mind before that.\u201dAll the three-hundred men stepped forward with a firm expression on their faces with the count of one. They had moved their feet with such force that the dust on the ground had been raised to the sky; even the ground had seemed to tremble under their strength.Jun Wu Yi had been watching all this from the side. He looked at all the people with eyes full of admiration and veneration.Jun Xie had lifted the morale of all the three-hundred men through the means of provocation; so much so that they wouldn\u2019t question even if they were ordered to march to their deaths. Jun Xie\u2019s words had brought out the blood-thirsty aspect of these people\u2019s nature. Jun Wu Yi was himself a general. He was used to build-up the morale of his soldiers. Jun Xie\u2019s words had even provoked him; so much so that his blood was boiling and he was breathing heavily. He felt as if he was looking over a blazing battlefield with smoky air, piles of corpses and a sea of blood.A long howl rose from within his soul. He could see a thousand soldiers marching up to their deaths with fire in their hearts. They seemed ready to charge through a hundred wars and live their lives without any regrets.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euJun Wu Yi and the three-hundred guards shared the same amount of excitement, and were exuding wild sparks from their eyes.All the three-hundred people had a same thought in their minds \u2013 they would rather embrace death in place of living a humiliating life.Even Jun Xie hadn\u2019t imagined that his speech would create a strong team of capable men who were ready to shake the entire world. This team would be god-like. These people would fill fear into the hearts of their enemies, and would force them to retreat in the battlefield.Jun Xie named this team as the Heavenly Destroyer and Spirit Devourer!The Evil Monarch\u2019s first team of invincible warriors had been born.\u00a0A god-like team had been born out of utter humiliation.

I\u2019ll not repeat what I\u2019m about to tell you \u2013 the one who violates the rules will be killed without any warning.\u201cTerms like \u2018corporal punishment\u2019 and \u2018regret\u2019 don\u2019t exist for me. I only understand the meaning of terms like \u2018victory\u2019 and \u2018death\u2019. So, you\u2019ll be given only these two choices under my leadership.\u201cI\u2019m your highest authority from this moment onwards\u2026 until the day your training comes to an end. You\u2019ll have to follow every order of mine throughout the period of your training. You\u2019ll not listen to anyone else; even my Third Uncle and Grandpa don\u2019t have any right to interfere in this matter.

Anyone who is late for training will be decapitated.\u201cAnyone who tries to convey his point-of-view regarding my orders will be decapitated.\u201cAnyone who dares to defy my orders will be decapitated.\u201c\u2026. will be decapitated.\u201c\u2026. decapitated.*** ***The sounds of \u2018decapitated\u2019 resounded in the air several times. A murderous aura had spread in all directions. Jun Xie\u2019s eyes seemed to have filled with cruel intentions. The three-hundred guards stood firm. Their bodies were stiff and their muscles were tensed; there was a trace of fear in their eyes.Even Jun Wu Yi had been affected. His blood was boiling. He was sitting upright in his wheelchair. He felt as if he had gone back in time, and was listening to his father\u2019s speech. He looked at Jun Xie with a sense of diligence and devotion in his eyes. The aura of an unyielding soldier had surged back into his personality.The guards felt an undergoing change in their personalities as they heard Jun Xie\u2019s inspiring words. Their persona started to emit an aura of iron-bloodied soldiers as before. Jun Wu Yi was aware of the impact that this transformation could make in the battlefield. Jun Xie\u2019s words could compel anyone to forget about one\u2019s regrets, resentments, and the difference between life and death to move ahead in the battle.The army which was headed by such a strong-headed leader could never lose a single battle.Grandpa Jun stood in the shadows on the other side of the training ground. His face had turned red. He had lost his usual calm as his blood was boiling. He was staring wide-eyed at Jun Xie. He was extremely excited; so much so that his hands and beard were trembling.[I can\u2019t believe this\u2026 Is this really my useless grandson Jun Mo Xie? Is this really him who\u2019s speaking those words? What a glorious aura of inspiration! What a\u2026] Grandpa was carried away in emotions. He started to rub his eyes; so much so that drops of tears started to pour out of them.Jun Zhan Tian tried and controlled his emotions. He then turned around. Suddenly, there appeared a bright gleam in his usually dull eyes. His hunched body seemed straighter than before. It was exuding an aura of pride and self-assurance. Old Pang felt as if the great general had assumed the aura of an indomitable warrior once again.Old Pang hadn\u2019t seen this aura around Jun Zhan Tian\u2019s personality ever since the Jun family had lose several of its mighty members.Jun Xie\u2019s words had instilled a sense of hope in Jun Zhan Tian\u2019s heart. Not only that \u2013 the hope was bright and mighty.[This grandson can help the Jun family in regaining its lost glory. No\u2026 not \u2018can\u2019\u2026 this grandson \u2018will\u2019 help the Jun family in regaining its lost glory.][It seems that the Heavens are finally showering their blessings on the Jun family.]Jun Zhan Tian finally said, \u201cCommunicate my orders to everyone\u2026 each and every word that comes out of the Third Young Master\u2019s mouth\u2026 each and every movement of his\u2026 will be guarded by the Jun family. This\u2019ll all be a top secret. Consider this to be a first-grade command. No one will be spared in case of disobeying my orders. That person will be killed without any exception. In fact, the person who violates my command will see the nine generations of his family executed.\u201cWe\u2019ve been keeping an eye on the spies sent by the other families. Now, we need to get rid of them. Moreover, find an excuse to transfer away the spies who\u2019ve been sent by the royal court. Also, activate our shadow operations. We need to keep an eye on the movements inside and outside the Jun residence. Kill a person if you find him or her passing on a message to an outsider. This is an opportunity to clean our house. We should ensure that nothing escapes our eyes.\u201dJun Zhan Tian\u2019s tone was characterized by an authority of a stubborn and resolute general. Old Pang could sense a murderous aura oozing out of his personality. He understood the relevance of this entire matter for Jun Zhan Tian. He was aware that Jun Zhan Tian would actually start a bloodbath if any of this was to leak out in the open.Jun Zhan Tian didn\u2019t know why and how his grandson had hidden his capabilities behind the mask of a debauchee. However, he was confident that there would certainly be a reason behind his actions. Maybe this was all a part of his plan. Jun Zhan Tian had been truly inspired by his grandson\u2019s words and actions. But still, he felt that he had behaved in a reckless manner. Jun Mo Xie would become a centre of attraction if any of this was to leak outside of the Jun family.Jun Zhan Tian didn\u2019t have a clue about the intent of the people keeping an eye on Jun Mo Xie.Therefore, he decided to help his grandson by providing him the utmost secrecy. He had issued a first-grade order in this regard. And, the person who countered his orders had been ordered to be killed immediately.Obviously, there hadn\u2019t been any act of hiding one\u2019s capabilities. It wasn\u2019t Jun Mo Xie who had spoken those words; it was Jun Xie \u2013 an ace assassin from another world.In the meantime, Jun Xie\u2019s shouts of \u2018decapitation\u2019 continued to resound in the training ground.He then said, \u201cNow, I\u2019m going to issue my first order as your leader. I want all of you to form two teams. You\u2019ve ten breaths\u2019 time to complete this task. You\u2019ll have to run around the training ground for a hundred laps if you fail to complete this task on time. And, your time starts now.\u201dSuddenly, the formation of the guards became a chaotic mess. People moved in and out of groups while bumping into each other. They had formed two groups of one-fifty men each within a short span of time.Jun Xie said, \u201cVery good! A company of one-fifty men will be divided into five platoons. Each platoon will consist of thirty men. Each of the platoons will be divided into three squads. Each of these squads will consists of ten men. Now, I\u2019ll give you a few minutes. And, you\u2019ll have to decide the leader of each company, platoon and squad.\u201cRemember this\u2026 make your choices very carefully as you\u2019ll have to follow the orders of your leaders in the future. Later, if anyone tries to counter any order of their leader\u2026 then he\u2019ll be dealt with according to the military protocol \u2014 he\u2019ll be decapitated.\u201dJun Xie then turned around and faced Jun Wu Yi.Jun Wu Yi looked at him for a while. Then, he smiled with a trace of astonishment in his eyes and said, \u201cMo Xie, your words and actions have truly surprised your Third Uncle.\u201dJun Xie touched his nose and laughed. He then said, \u201cThird Uncle, what do you think about this?\u201dJun Xie hadn\u2019t clearly mentioned the matter about which he wanted to know Jun Wu Yi\u2019s thoughts. However, Jun Wu Yi understood the implied meaning behind his words. He said, \u201cI had planned to find fault with your words. But, truly speaking\u2026 I didn\u2019t find anything wrong in whatever you said. I\u2019m sure that our soldiers can take over the world if they undergo this kind of a training.\u201d\u201c\u2026 take over the world?\u201d Suddenly, a dark crease appeared on Jun Xie\u2019s forehead. \u201cThird Uncle, you\u2019re saying too many kind words. There\u2019s a difference in the way you and I begin our training. You train the soldiers for the sake of the Tian Xiang Kingdom\u2026 But, I intend to train the soldiers to protect the Jun family. So, there\u2019s a huge difference in the methods of our training.\u201d\u201c\u2026 training for the sake of the Kingdom\u2026 for the safety of the Jun family?\u201d Jun Wu Yi was a great general who was loyal to his Kingdom. However, his handicap had pushed these thoughts out of his mind for a period of ten years. He knew that the Jun family had provided a great service to the Kingdom. However, it had to lose several of its members. Moreover, he himself had been paralyzed. Jun Wu Yi wouldn\u2019t have complained if this had happened on a battlefield. He wouldn\u2019t have mind suffering this fate at the hands of his enemies during a war. However, all this had happened in suspicious circumstances. And, the Kingdom had behaved as if nothing had happened\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHis father had been consistently trying to find out the conspiracy behind this entire matter. However, he had failed to move ahead with his investigation every time he had landed with some crucial information. It wasn\u2019t possible that there was no one behind these occurrences. But again, the Kingdom had behaved in an indifferent manner. This had caused Jun Wu Yi to lose interest in the matters of the Kingdom.The \u2018old\u2019 Jun Wu Yi would\u2019ve jumped and caught Jun Xie after hearing his intention of training the soldiers for the protection of the Jun family in place of the Kingdom. He would\u2019ve labelled him as a traitor and a criminal. However, the \u2018present\u2019 Jun Wu Yi didn\u2019t care about these things. At the most, he was lost\u2026[Was all of that worth anything?]Jun Xie sighed and continued to speak, \u201cSeveral people have their evil eyes fixed on our great Jun family. Especially, these days its facing a lot of delicate situations; it\u2019s on the verge of facing a catastrophe. I wouldn\u2019t have mind being a useless parasite if the situation had been different.\u201dJun Wu Yi looked at Jun Xie with sharp eyes. He then said, \u201cSo, that\u2019s why you\u2019ve decided to reveal your true capabilities? You mean to say that you would\u2019ve continued to wreak havoc in form of a debauchee if the Jun family wasn\u2019t facing these challenges? I\u2019m surprised to see such a level of insight at such a young age.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If he had not transmigrated over to this body, Jun Mo Xie would definitely have continued being a debauchee. Would he have such a high level of insight? Definitely not! However, should the Jun Family rise up again, Jun Mo Wuji would continue acting as a debauchee. And if his hands ever felt itchy, he could simply go off and assassinate some men who deserved death.\u201cEven though you might say that, I will still continue to mess around like a debauchee,\u201d Jun Mo Xie smiled and said to Jun Wu Yi. \u201cIf Third Uncle gets well, you can shelter me! When that happens, I can continue to be the Jun Mo Xie of old. Who would dare to act against me?\u201dJun Wu Yi chuckled, \u201cBrat, do whatever you want! Anyways, from what I see\u2026 no one is able to get the better out of you, you brat!\u201dBy now, the two companies had already finished Jun Mo Xie\u2019s assignment. The company, platoon and squad leaders all stood before their respective units.Jun Mo Xie slowly turned and walked towards the two companies. \u201cFrom now on, the two companies shall treat each other as rivals! Since I still don\u2019t know much about all of you, I will not assign any new training instructions. Over the next ten days, you shall continue following my original training plans.\u201d Jun Mo Xie continued and added more emphasis to these following words, \u201cHowever, every set will be increased by three folds! Is that clear?\u201dEveryone jolted.\u201cThree days from now, there will be a contest between squads. Every platoon will select their best squads to participate in the contest!\u201d\u201cFive days later, there will be a platoon contest!\u201d\u201cIn seven days, the companies will have a showdown!\u201d\u201cThe losing Company will have its Company leader go on stage and slap himself in the face! Is that Understood?\u201dStillness filled the air!\u201cIs my question understood?\u201d Jun Mo Xie repeated in an imposing manner\u201cUnderstood!\u201d The soldiers shouted.\u201cThe company leaders will watch over the training programs and regardless of what you use, I will not care. I am only interested in the results! I am eager to see who will go up and slap himself in the face after losing the contest!\u201d\u201cThe contest will be monthly, if a Company Leader losses three times a row, he will bark naked up on stage and I will be sure to bring everybody in this residence to let them enjoy the show!\u201d\u201cFor now, I will not bother learning your names until half a year passes. I have already created the names of the companies. Sky Raiders will be the name of the first company, Soul Eaters will be the second company\u2019s name!\u201d\u201cOnly those who are strong will be allowed to join these companies! For now, none of you has met my expectations and is not qualified to join them. When you join the companies, I will bother to remember your names! If you are not capable, you will be nothing but bones by then!\u201d\u201cWhen you come back, you must set a schedule for your meals and toilet breaks. Those who break the schedule will be punished! No matter what the activity you plan may be, a timetable must be made. You are to decide your own punishment! Once done, give your plans to me! Go and follow my commands! You lot are dismissed!\u201d\u201cThe two newly appointed Company Leaders, rather than experiencing the joys of promotion, are made to carry the burden resembling a journey to Hell! Wearing a face akin to eating dirt, they led their respective company away.\u201d\u201cEveryone had the same thought process, not only would they not be punished, they get to witness the losing Company Leader slap himself in the face and there was an even more interesting show to watch if a company losses three times continuously.What was there to fear about the contest? If three folds weren\u2019t sufficient, then five folds, if five wasn\u2019t sufficient then ten folds. They would just require their training to be intensified. Training could only be useful if their lives were on the line.Since this moment, the Jun Family\u2019s three hundred guards had stepped into a living hell\u2026Jun Zhan Tian exhaled loudly and waved his hands from afar, signalling Old Pang to leave with him.\u201cHouse Master, do you still need Young Master for questioning?\u201d\u201cIs there any need for it? Just let him do as he wants,\u201d Jun Zhan Tian replied in a relaxed voice, a load off his mind.\u201cHouse Master, why was the Company Leader chosen by the Young Master to be punished? Shouldn\u2019t the rest of the losing soldiers be punished as well?\u201d\u201cOld Pang, think about being in the Company Leader\u2019s shoes and your company of guards lost, causing you to have to slap yourself in the face, and even then having the possibility of being forced to strip naked before barking like a dog, how would you feel then? Would you spare those Platoon Leaders under you?\u201d\u201cAfter the Platoon Leader had enough of the Company Leader\u2019s anger, how do you think he will treat his Squad Leaders under him?\u201d\u201cEach chain of command carries its own duty and pressure, with the lowest guard having the greatest amount of pressure, that pressure will build up and form a sort of peer pressure that has never been done before. This will be a great way to train soldiers! For Mo Xie to think of such an idea, if the army were to have such a person as a general, he would excel as a talent!\u201d Jun Zhan Tian felt content.\u201cSo that\u2019s why!\u201d Old Pang mused to himself. \u201cSuch a malicious move by the Young Master.\u201d\u201cMalicious? Hardly.\u201d Jun Zhan Tian looked as he organized his thoughts. \u201cThis is the best way to use their abilities to the fullest while allowing the one with absolute authority to focus on other matters. This is also the most cost-effective method of employing men. It works as well from a business perspective, whether it be the management of the military or the state! At the very least, I have not found a better way! This brat is exceptional!\u201dThe Jun Family\u2019s medical warehouse had no small amount of goods stocked within, but the herbs listed by Jun Mo Xie were quite rare. Jun Wu Yi immediately went to arrange for some men, placing a responsibility on them to seek out the herbs. Those herbs had to be bought from the outside pharmacies!As Jun Mo Xie rushed to his own room, he did not even check any of his prizes as he closed both the door and windows before sitting down cross-legged.Jun Mo Xie had spent a substantial amount of time walking through the streets today.During it, he felt an irregular reaction coming from the surging white mist within his sea of consciousness. This caused Jun Mo Xie no small amount of surprise. However, what had surprised Jun Mo Xie more was that the feeling disappeared after he reached home.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter calming down, he carefully exercised his Arts again, but was unable to detect the presence of any strangeness which caused him to be perplexed, could there have been external factors at play here?Another thing caused Jun Mo Xie to become perplexed. Without him realizing, when he was not practising his Arts, the white mist would gush out from his sea of consciousness and flow along Jun Mo Xie\u2019s meridians for one cycle before returning. It was during such that the white mist would appear the longest, granting huge benefits for Jun Mo Xie\u2019s body. But only a slight trace of white mist would appear when Jun Mo Xie tried using his Arts. However, the benefits were far less than that of when it had appeared and Jun Mo Xie forcefully moved the mist around his meridians when compared to its natural occurrence.The third thing, which Jun Mo Xie could not understand was the Art of Unlocking Heaven\u2019s Fortune. Just from its name and the way it came about, this Art must naturally be amazing!After practising to the point of being able to sense it, the size of his energy flow still stayed as thick as a hair. Regardless of how much effort Jun Xie had put in, he was unable to increase its size! Even though the energy flow was convenient to use, very firm and was of superior quality; its quantity had been severely lacking.Comparing the internal energy he had in his past life and his current life; his past life\u2019s energy flow was as thick as a finger while the current energy flow within his meridians was only as thick as a hair. The difference between the two was unmatched! If one were to compare the quality between both, the internal energy of his previous life was akin to a hemp rope while his current one was akin to the divine silk of legends, which cannot be harmed by even the most precious swords. However, this was only a guess as the two energies were simply incomparable!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, Jun Mo Xie was still discontented as this amount of energy could only be considered the starting stage. It was hardly useful. Indeed, it could be useful when he was gambling, but would it be useful in a life and death battle with a sword user? This level of energy was simply not enough!Even if it\u2019s the divine silkworm\u2019s silk whose single thread can hold up to two hundred jin, a highly praiseworthy capacity, Jun Mo Xie wanted more. He wanted a hundred or a thousand of those threads to come together and become his source of internal energy!His desire to strengthen the energy flow to fill up his meridians, caused Jun Mo Xie to feel like there was still a long way to go.However, Jin Mo Xie held a huge advantage \u2013 which was his capability of using sneak attacks which were truly incomprehensible and indiscernible! Jun Mo Xie closed his eyes as he thought of ways of using the energy flow in his body. Slowly, he entered a meditative state\u2026Backed by a huge group of men, Tang Wan Li rushed aggressively towards the Li\u2019s Residence but felt as though he had instead run into soft cotton. The Li Residence\u2019s Head, Li You Ran received him in a warm, affectionate and hospitable manner, causing Tang Wan Li to feel a little uncomfortable, as he was not able to find any faults to argue about.Although he had been determined to throw a fit, when faced against Li You Ran\u2019s affable and calm smile, he found himself unable to do so. However, the act of keeping his pent-up anger was hard to bear. After drinking a cup of tea, he slammed the teacup down, resulting in the shattering of the cup.\u201cCome, quickly prepare another cup of tea for the old Duke.\u201d Li You Ran continued his gentle smile as he said but then, his voice turned heavy. \u201cI was too careless earlier. Quickly fetch the top grade Han Yan tea in my grandfather\u2019s room which I now recall, my grandfather had once stated that it is Duke Tang\u2019s favourite tea.\u201dAfter instructing the servants, he lowered his voice again and looking apologetically at Tang Wan Li, spoke. \u201cSenior Duke, I hope you do not mind that this junior had failed to instruct my men properly earlier. At the same time, if this junior had made a mistake, then please point it out. I will immediately get the servants to fix it for you.\u201dLike a dog that had eaten dirt, Tang Wan Li stared with his mouth wide open, He was simply unable to utter a single sound. After a time of silence, he finally demanded. \u201cGet Li Feng, Li Zhen, those two little beasts, out here now. This senior has something to ask of them.\u201dLi You Ran showed an obviously reluctant expression. \u201cIt is certainly a blessing for those juniors to be able to receive pointers from the Senior Duke. However, Senior Duke\u2019s timing is a little off as those two had just committed a mistake and are currently undergoing disciplinary punishment. I hope that Senior Duke can show some kindness and wait a while for both of them to serve their punishment before coming to receive your pointers\u2026\u201dWhen the Tang family members heard this, they became startled and started heading into the Li Residence\u2019s disciplinary hall. Seeing Li Feng and Li Zhen being beaten to a bloody pulp, Tang Wan Li found his overflowing fury dissipating by half. He settled for only asking a few questions. Hearing that the cause of this matter was from the Meng Family\u2019s, Meng Hai Zou, who had actually sought after Tang Yuan\u2019s fianc\u00e9e for a long time and as Li Zhen, and Li Feng, they had already been punished for their involvement in this matter. Hearing all this, Grandfather Tang\u2019s fury towards the Li Family had mostly been dissipated but now his rage against the Meng Family soared to booming heights.After quickly saying his goodbyes, Tang Wan Li immediately led his men back up the horses while Li You Ran personally accompanied them out, his face showing a sorry expression as he kept apologizing for being a bad host. He earnestly bid them farewell as he watched Grandfather Tang lead his group of men away and speed towards the Meng Family.Li You Ran\u2019s face revealed a trace of an elegant smile. In his eyes, a strange chill appeared for the briefest moments before disappearing. Lifting his robes and straightening himself. He entered the residence, his actions both leisurely and relaxed, not showing any trace of anger\u2026As the sky slowly became darker. Thunder broke out and the rain started falling. As the rain fell harder and harder, it seemed as though both Heaven and Earth had become one. Li You Ran suddenly stopped walking. Raising his head, he observed the thick rain; he shook his head and laughed lightly as he whispered. \u201cIt seems that Duke Tang\u2019s stay at the Meng\u2019s Residence will have to be extended\u2026 Hahahaha\u2026\u201d\u2026Little Ke sat on the window, her eyes moist as her hands held onto the incense pot while staring at the heavy rain.After his training had been done, Jun Mo Xie straightened himself and walked up behind Little Ke. He gently asked. \u201cLittle Ke, what are you thinking about?\u201dLittle Ke screamed out in shock, turning around, she was momentarily at a loss before straightening herself and bowed. \u201cYoung Master.\u201dJun Mo Xie went to the side and sat down on a chair and by habit, he raised his leg up. \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d Observing the little girl before him, she was both tender and likeable which made Jun Mo Xie unable to stop himself from teasing her. That was also why he felt concerned after seeing her in deep thoughts.\u201cI\u2026 I was just thinking\u2026 In a few days\u2019 time, the autumn festival will arrive\u2026\u201d Little Ke\u2019s seemed to be on the brink of tears. \u201cI still remember that three years ago, during the autumn festival, I was nine, I went with my father and mother. Back then\u2026 I was so cheerful\u2026 so happy\u2026 father, mother\u2026\u201d She was no longer able to continue her sentence as two drops of tears rolled down, falling onto the ground.\u201cThen where is your father now?\u201d Just as Jun Mo Xie asked this question, he recalled that Little Ke\u2019s father was once a squad leader serving the Jun Family. He had followed Jun Mo Xie\u2019s big brother, Jun Mo You, for an expedition, never to return.Little Ke\u2019s mother eventually died of illness due to sorrow and overwork but before she died, she had sent Little Ke to the Jun Residence, beseeching the Jun Family to take care of her daughter. Due to these events, Little Ke was currently an orphan with no parents!Thinking back, Little Ke had always endured quietly even when that old brat, Jun Mo Xie, kept treating her badly, even cursing at her all the time. Jun Mo Xie could not help but pity her. Sighing lightly, he reached out and stroked her head, but remained silent.\u00a0Jun Mo Xie\u2019s heart suddenly felt sour as he heard the words Autumn Festival, he realized that the Mid-Autumn Festival will soon be upon them.It looks like I will have to celebrate this traditional Chinese festival all by myself in this world.Little Ke felt Jun Mo Xie lightly stroking her hair, his movement surprisingly gentle, even if he did not speak a word, she could feel Jun Mo Xie\u2019s pity and sincereness. As though she had been a little sister who had left home and had suddenly bumped into her big brother, a burst of warmth suddenly enveloped her. Her heart was washed with a soft and warm feeling and she suddenly felt that this debauchee who had always cursed at her had, at this moment, become the closest person to her.Although this change in feeling was unexpected and bizarre, she could not help but lean her small body closer to his. Feeling the warmth of his body, she felt unconcerned about the heavy rain outside.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter a long time had passed, Jun Mo Xie stroked Little Ke\u2019s hair again and said. \u201cGet a good rest. It\u2019s better if you go get some sleep. I am going out for a bit.\u201d\u201cYoung Master, It\u2019s raining heavily right now. Where are you going? What if you fall sick from the rain? I will go prepare the raining gear for you!\u201d Little Ke felt confused and quickly became concerned.Jun Mo Xie smiled faintly his face painted with an indifferent expression and simply stated \u201cI will be fine.\u201d before grabbing a bamboo hat and placing it on his head and opening the doors, with a straight stature, he headed out into the heavy rain.Little Ke\u2019s face was filled with worry as she could sense that the Young Master was suffering from an unspeakable pain and torment\u2026As if sensing Jun Mo Xie\u2019s perturbed feelings, the Hongjun Pagoda within his sea of consciousness rose up and began exuding the white mist. The white mist then flowed through Jun Mo Xie\u2019s blood and qi as it made a cycle through Jun Mo Xie\u2019s meridians, as though trying to disperse Jun Mo Xie\u2019s current state of melancholy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Due to the sudden heavy downpour, the main street, which was usually bustling with activity and people, was now empty. On the other hand, the shops on the sides were brimming with packed with people. Time and time again, sounds of cursing or laughter can be heard coming out from the shops.With the sound of the heavy downpour, the rowdy noises had seemingly merged together. Jun Mo Xie strolled alone among the heavy rain, watching the rain cut off the Heavens and Earth from each other. As the rain fell on his bamboo hat, Jun Mo Xie felt his own insignificance and loneliness.So what if he had been the world\u2019s best assassin in his past life? So what if he had been granted a substantial opportunity to transcend death, transmigrating into another world? So what if he had managed to obtain the immeasurably mysterious treasure, the Hongjun Pagoda? So what if he has the opportunity to practice the mysterious Art of Unlocking Heaven\u2019s Fortune?At the end of the day, he was but a drop of water amidst a raging sea. So minuscule, so solitary and so alone\u2026\u201cThe predecessors will never meet their ancestors; the successors will never meet their descendants. Leisurely studying Heaven and Earth, and yet alone and inferior,\u201d Jun Mo Xie laughed bitterly as he shook his head, thinking that he should have been the one who has written this poem. Born in another world, he was truly a man without a precedent and without a descendant! The true descendant of Yan and Huang in this world was no one but himself!Water covered every inch of the ground due to the heavy rain. The fog which accompanied the rain was extremely heavy, it obscured the skies, causing everything to be hazy and blurry. Even the surrounding downpour seemed to have lost its sound\u2026 Jun Mo Xie suddenly felt as he was in a dream, every single person and every other thing mattered no more. There was only him, walking alone through the pouring rain\u2026Jun Mo Xie felt as if he was a ghost or in a dream, his heavy footsteps which echoed in the rain and yet felt afar. This incomplete feeling made Jun Mo Xie who was once a cold-blooded assassin to feel vulnerable and weak.As he found himself looking into a dark place, he had realized that he had unconsciously exited the main street and entered into a narrow alleyway. In the midst of the rain, there hung a conspicuous bamboo pole which stood tilted from a shop and from within came the smell of wine.The only way to drown sorrows was to shut it out!The only way to shut sorrows out was wine! Jun Mo Xie hesitated for a moment before entering the wine shop.The shop had only fifteen tables, yet barely anyone was present. Considering how small the shop was, it was obvious that the shop\u2019s business will have been affected by the heavy rain outside. Within the corner of the shop, there was one person with a bamboo hat which hid his face, sat while drinking wine. He seemed to be enjoying himself but only felt as he was lonely.Jun Mo Xie sat silently in the corner, ordering two plates of small snacks and a jug of wine and help himself to the wine.He was by himself in a small shop within the heavy rain.I toast this cup to those whom I have killed in my previous life. Forgive me, for there is no chance for your revenge. Gulp!I toast this cup to those whose life I will take in my current life. Forgive me, for you are destined to die by my hands. Cheers!I toast this cup to my Master, my fellow brothers and sisters. I wish your missions to forever be successful. May you all be able to retire early and live a peaceful life.I toast this cup to\u2026Jun Mo Xie drank alone, downing one cup after another. Without a single noise, he poured all his feelings, grief and solitariness into the cups and drank them all away. Everything flowed into his stomach! From today onwards, in this world, I am Jun Mo Xie! Jun Xie, the best assassin from my past life is nothing more than a fleeting memory!The wine from the small shop was nothing special, it was even slightly weak in taste, for someone like Jun Mo Xie who had drunk top grade wines, the wine was even a bit difficult for him to drink! However, Jun Mo Xie was not considering good or bad wine. Even if he were to be given celestial fairy wine, he would not be able to taste any of it. All he could feel now was bitterness, sourness and sorrow\u2026Within this unfamiliar world, this will be the only time that he indulged in his weakness.Henceforth, I will tread the path of the Evil Monarch, a path filled with blood! I will utilize the mountain of bones and ocean of blood from my past to achieve my unmatched reputation as the Evil Monarch once more!The Otherworldly Evil Monarch is I, Jun Mo Xie!Yet one more cup was downed, but Jun Mo Xie had yet to feel drunk. He simply continued pouring one cup after another, gulping it down\u2026Jun Mo Xie did not realize that his act of casting everything away, as though he was the only one in the world, had completely isolated him from everything, the Heavens and Earth\u2026 It could have only come from the loneliness of a person forsaken by his own world. The faint feelings of joy and loneliness, all merged perfectly into one upon his body.It was only at this moment that Jun Xie remained Jun Xie, the best yet mysterious assassin, and not Jun Mo Xie!In the corner of the shop, the only customer around, when Jun Mo Xie entered, had only given him a glance, was now staring intently at Jun Mo Xie. He watched as Jun Mo Xie sat alone, drinking away his sorrows, exuding an elegant loneliness; his tolerance deep and far beyond the norm, causing him to become curious.Jun Mo Xie did not know how much wine he had drunk; he only continued raising his cup. As he was about to down another cup, he suddenly heard someone speaking out. \u201cThis brother is an able drinker. Due to the heavy rain outside, there is but the two of us here. Since we had such a fateful meeting, what say we drink together?\u201dJun Mo Xie raised his head and saw that the customer had already removed his bamboo hat, revealing a dignified face and a prestigious aura; his gaze as soft as water as he smiled at Jun Mo Xie.Jun Mo Xie laughed and removed the bamboo hat on his head, leaving it hanging behind. \u201cThe anxious autumn wind and rain brings a halt to men. For us to be meeting here like this is indeed the work of fate. Since it is fate, why should we not drink together? Come!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe other party did not expect Jun Mo Xie to be so young and was momentarily startled before laughing. \u201cIndeed, observing fate is better than offering respects.\u201d He then ordered a few more dishes and two jugs of wine. Holding the wine cup, he came over and sat before Jun Mo Xie. He smiled and asked. \u201cA magnificent youngster such as you is truly a rarity in this city. I wonder which great family does this younger generation hail from?\u201d\u201cGreat family\u2019s younger generation?\u201d Jun Mo Xie gave out a laugh and replied with disdain. \u201cFloating through the world without a name, treating it as a game, ask not the gentlemen his name! Could it be that in this brother\u2019s eyes, only someone from a great family can possess an outstanding demeanour?\u201d\u201cOh? Haha, this is surely a mistake on my part. Then please consider this cup as my punishment!\u201d The middle-aged man raised his cup and gulped it down, his movements casual and carefree. Observing his face, Jun Mo Xie had long deduced that this man was not an average person. The aura emitted from his brows were rich and powerful, every move made was innately refined with great skill and care. A few spiritual probing from the outside entered the small shop, which was from his bodyguards. This person must be someone with a high position and not easily met.To see such an individual admit his own mistakes towards a stranger and without getting angry while punishing himself, Jun Mo Xie felt his attitude towards this person changing. He felt that sitting and drinking wine together with this kind of individual was not an undeserving act.\u201cMay I ask for younger brother\u2019s esteemed name?\u201d That man gulped down the wine as he watched Jun Mo Xie, with his indifference, causing him to become interested in Jun Mo Xie\u2019s identity.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Men wander throughout the world, must chance meetings end up becoming acquainted? Once it\u2019s over, we will go our separate ways and may never miss today. The name is nought but a mark. Would it be a fortune if you recalled it? Would it be a misfortune if you forgot it?\u201d Jun Mo Xie remained immersed in his sorrows.It was obvious that if he had said out the words \u2018Jun Mo Xie\u2019, his real name, who knows if this man would end up panicking and run away even in this heavy rain? After all, his notorious reputation as a debauchee can be considered quite the lethal object.\u201cFloating through the world without a name, treating it as a game, ask not the gentlemen his name! Men wander throughout the world, must chance meetings end up becoming acquainted?\u201d The nobleman slowly repeated the words and could not help but be moved by those words.\u201cGood sentence! A truly good sentence! I did not expect you could be able to utter such great words. Not even a learned scholar is able to utter such phrases. It seemed that I was being too rude again.\u201d Looking at Jun Mo Xie, he laughed leisurely. \u201cLittle brother\u2019s logic makes sense, it is I who was too rigid in following tradition, I am willing to accept another cup as punishment!\u201dJun Mo Xie hastily stopped him. \u201cYou have drunk continuously while I have not even drunk a single cup. Are you sure you are not finding an excuse to drink more than me right?\u201dThe man became startled before breaking into laughter. He gulped down his cup before wiping his mouth.\u201cEven though this wine is without a name, it can still be considered a good wine, strong and piquant! A real man should be drinking this wine! True, it should be normal to find more excuses for the sake of drinking more of this wine.\u201d\u201cThis wine? This can be considered good?\u201d Jun Mo Xie sneered. \u201cBrother, could it be that you have never had any good wine? This wine can only be drunk when you have no better options on hand. If this kind of wine can be considered good, then wouldn\u2019t there be no bad wine in this world?\u201dThe man\u2019s eye lit up as he said. \u201cOld Song\u2019s wine shop may not be big, but his wine is highly desired within this city. All wine lovers treat it with reverence. If not for the rain today, this place would have been full by now and also why both of us are able to enjoy this wine. This is a lucky day for both of us! You may not know but Old Song sells only twenty jugs of wine a day, ten in the afternoon and ten in the evening. He will not sell even a jug more! If your words were to be heard by Old Song, I fear he will not let you go.\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026 You are a superb person. To think that you are able to make me laugh when I am feeling like this\u201d Jun Mo Xie was trying to hold in his laughter but he was unable to do so. \u201cHow laughable! Such a weak wine actually has such a limited amount? The wines that this young master has had before were at least a hundred times stronger than this!\u201dThe words spoken were not a boast. The strength of the wine was only around twenty percent of Baijiu. For Jun Mo Xie who was accustomed to drinking the world\u2019s finest wines in his past life, this wine was indeed inferior. In fact, people from the modern times might not even be willing to drink this wine. After all, In terms of quality, the wine was also slightly turbid, as though it was lacking in hygiene!The middle-aged man\u2019s face became somewhat unsightly. \u201cLittle brother, I can see that you are an elegant scholar, but how can you say something like this? Food can be eaten in whatever way we like, but the same cannot be done with words! The wines I had at the Royal Palace was not even a fraction in comparison to this. It only had extra flavour due to its luxury, but was instead less spicy and vigorous! The wine was incapable of arousing my blood. To me, this wine is a fine wine that can rarely be found in this world! Little brother, saying that the wines you had tried are a hundred times better are a mere exaggeration!\u201d\u201cHehehe, oh? You do not believe me?\u201d Jun Mo Xie looked at him with slit eyes. \u201cI have no reason to make you believe me, hahaha\u2026 However\u2026 drinking wine! Fellow brother, do you know what it means to drink wine? Do you know what it takes for one to be considered drinking wine?\u201dThe middle-aged man was made speechless. He had begun to regret coming over. This kid was far too abnormal; he had come over with such good intentions, and yet this kid did not show any appreciation or respect at all. Even if he was a talent, he was still just a prideful and unrestrained scholar; it would be difficult for him to become a great renowned talent.Jun Mo Xie gave out a \u201cheng\u201d and said in a low voice. \u201cThe true act of drinking wine is to drink in one\u2019s emotions! Or even one\u2019s thoughts! Pouring wine into one\u2019s belly alone cannot be considered the act of drinking wine. That is simply the act of wasting good wine! Wine! Oh, wine! To think that not only were there no good wine in this world, there is also none who understands wine, much less the act of drinking wine! There is no such thing as wine tasting, no such thing as appreciation for wine! The virtuous and ancient sages were all solitary figures, only drinkers leave their names behind. How pitiful! Within this vast world, not a single drinker can be found! What a world encompassing sorrow! How uncalled for!\u201dHaving drank his final cup, Jun Mo Xie stood up. Raising his head, he gave a hearty laugh. \u201cA great distance of a million li, a sea of humanity numbering hundreds of millions; yet, not a single one can keep me company as I drink, and not a single wine is worthy of making me joyful as I drink! This world is simply too sorrowful! Ahaha, when drinking wine with a bosom friend, a thousand cups are too little, when words exchanged are disagreeable, even a little is too much! When the wine is not good, the people become weary. Where is the meaning in drinking? I will take my leave!\u201dThis kind of inferior wine\u2026 is actually a rare wine? When I point out its inferiority, someone actually objects? What the hell? Jun Mo Xie\u2019s heart was filled with fury; he felt as though he was playing the lute to the cow. This world was full of nothing but country bumpkins\u2026How can such a person be worthy of accompanying me, the Evil Monarch, as I drink?A silver ingot fell onto the table with a loud sound. Jun Mo Xie then walked out the door with laughter filled with pride; his body penetrated through the heavy fog and rain, disappearing in an instant.Even with his composure, the middle-aged man found himself somewhat angered. This youngster was so young, and yet so conceited! No matter what, he was still someone with a lofty identity. To think that the wine that he liked the most and had considered as the best was actually worth less than trash to the youngster! Wasn\u2019t that simply implying that he\u2026However, his heart was a little envious of Jun Mo Xie\u2019s carefree and wilful nature, that personality of conceit and unrestrained arrogance! When will I be able to live such a life? This city is just a huge cage\u2026\u201cEven though he seemed unrestrained and arrogant, this may not be his true character. The virtuous and ancient sages were all solitary figures, only drinkers leave their names behind, what a good sentence!\u201d The middle-aged man contemplated silently, raising his cup to drink. Could it be a psychological effect? Or was there some other reason? The wine, which he had always felt was one of the best, had suddenly felt harder to swallow.\u201cThe ancients created poems for every seven paces they take.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI always thought they were just flattering the ancients. It seemed that a poem for every seven paces is indeed nothing excessive, especially the last two sentences. It is truly something!\u201d He gently murmured to himself. \u201cWhen drinking wine with a bosom friend, a thousand cups are too little, when words exchanged are disagreeable, even a little is too much! Not bad, not bad at all. This scholar really does have some skill.\u201dHaving said that, the middle-aged man suddenly fell silent as he thought of something, then he laughed. \u201cThis bastard, he actually meant to say that I am not his bosom friend and that the words we exchanged were disagreeable, haha\u2026 to think he had actually cursed at me before leaving, and having used such an indirect way to do it\u2026 he is truly an educated scholar! However, in this entire Kingdom, the only other person who dares to openly curse at me like that is only my royal brother. This brat had truly made me feel refreshed.\u201dIn his life, Jun Mo Xie has had many kinds of labels placed on him, a mad assassin, a bloodthirsty devil and other immeasurable names. However, \u201ceducated scholar\u201d was never one of them. Even Jun Mo Xie could not have imagined that his recalling of old memories and his few successive verses had caused him to be labelled as an \u201ceducated scholar\u201d! Not to mention, he was believed to be indirectly cursing at others. If he were to know about this, he would be filled with a sense of ridiculousness.If Jun Mo Xie had wanted to curse at someone, then he would undoubtedly point at the person when doing so. What do you mean cursing indirectly? For Jun Mo Xie, even the act of cursing someone face to face would not suffice.The middle-aged man laughed for a good while. Suddenly, he felt something amiss. Turning around, he saw a short, thin withered looking old man gazing with dim eyes at the direction that Jun Mo Xie had taken. He stood motionless, his face expressing regret.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Have the brat\u2019s words roused your anger?\u201d The middle-aged man lifted his wine jug, pouring another cup for himself gracefully. \u201cHe is just a young and unchecked scholar saying nonsense. You are somebody with great tolerance, there is no need for you to get angry because of him. He may not recognize how good your wine is, but I do.\u201d\u201cYour Highness may not know, but my proudest achievement I have is this wine, it has been an accumulation of my entire life. As for the rest, they nought but things of the past. Hearing that little brat treat my wine with contempt, all I did was laugh and ignore him!\u201d Old Song stared at the direction Jun Mo Xie left with a blank and distracted look.\u201cIt is a pity to have just missed him after he had spoken his last sentence. To miss out on meeting a fellow friend who understands wine\u201d\u201cA fellow friend who understands wine? Pity?\u201d The middle-aged man who was addressed as \u201cYour Highness\u201d was startled.\u201cIndeed, it is a true pity!\u201d Old Song nodded without hesitation. \u201cTo be able to utter such words, he had proven himself as someone who truly understands wine!\u201d He then murmured. \u201cThe true act of drinking wine is to drink in one\u2019s emotions or thoughts! Just pouring wine into one\u2019s belly cannot be considered the act of drinking wine. That is just wasting good wine! One who understands how to drink wine, the meaning of wine tasting and the appreciation of wine. To think that I have missed out on meeting such a fellow friend who understands wine is truly the biggest regret in one\u2019s life\u2026\u201dGlancing around, the bamboo hat that Jun Mo Xie had left hanging had unknowingly vanished.Old Song\u2019s eyes flickered, the pupils of eyes suddenly flashed with a pale blue colour\u2026Unfortunately, the one addressed as \u201cYour Highness\u201d was looking at him from behind and did not notice this.Yellow for Earth Rank, Blue for Sky Rank!This Old Song who was unseemly and seemed to know only how to make wine was actually a Sky Ranked expert! Standing below only the Supreme God rank, Sky Xuan experts could be considered the pinnacle of power within the Xuan Xuan Continent! Such a distinguished individual was actually staying in such a small and remote wine shop!Such misfortune, if Jun Mo Xie had stayed, with his supreme spiritual sense, he could easily have discovered the extreme aspect of Old Song and his love of wine. Unfortunately, Jun Mo Xie had long since left; without even a shadow to be seen\u2026After leaving the wine shop, Jun Mo Xie walked slowly, both his heart and mind gradually becoming clear. He emerged out of the bizarre state that he was in; that state could be considered the representation of the Evil Monarch, Jun Mo Xie, from the past. The state which held only disdain towards the world! Saying whatever he wished to say, doing whatever he wished to do, not fearing offending others, even if it meant choosing a separate path from tens of thousands of people. Even if his actions would be condemned by millions of others, the original Evil Monarch would proudly continue forward, standing lonesome against the world!Acting on his own whim, without a single hesitation, uncaring of the feelings of others!If the world chooses to praise me and lift my reputation to the skies, I would simply accept it while retaining a clear conscience.If the world chooses to curse me, I would also accept it all the same!This heretical personality of his was what gave him the name \u201cEvil Monarch\u201d!After venting his frustration, Jun Mo Xie who had calmed down would naturally choose to stop the feelings as the \u201cEvil Monarch\u201d. He stared at the heavy rain and found that there was nowhere else to go. Since there was nowhere good to go, he turned and headed towards his own home.As he was about to turn into the corner of a street, Jun Mo Xie was suddenly startled and slowed down his pace. A low muffled voice came from beyond the corner. An average person would never have heard it in the middle of such a heavy rain! If not for the fact that Jun Mo Xie\u2019s ears were far keener than others, he would have been like the rest.\u201cWe finally succeeded. If it was not for this heavy rain, we would never have this chance to even touch this item from the Tang family. This was blessed by the heavens\u201dTang Family? Jun Mo Xie fell into shock as he immediately thought of Tang Yuan\u2019s family. Pondering about this, he moved his body, using the heavy rain as a cover and hid behind a wall with a flash.The wall was an earthen wall, not high by usual standards and definitely incapable of hiding an entire person. However, it provided an excellent cover within this heavy rain, which was filled with fog; not mentioning that the people in front were not even aware of his existence.He slowly removed the bamboo hat and was immediately soaked from head to toe in water.This due to the sound produced by the rain hitting the bamboo rain hat differed from the sound produced from rain hitting the earthen wall.Jun Mo Xie could not help but be careful. Of course, there was still a fine difference in sound produced from rain hitting the body compared to hitting the earthen wall. However, when compared to the bamboo hat, this difference was far smaller.Amidst the gasping breaths, roughly six people walked forward with great effort. None of them expected that a person would be around in this heavy rain. One of them who was holding on to a parcel turned around and said. \u201cThe plan that was set up for so long, but never was completed. For us to have finally completed it, the master will definitely be overjoyed once he finds out.\u201dAnother man replied while gasping. \u201cAlthough we succeeded, it was not without costs. How unexpected, even though only two of the six elites were around, they still managed to detect our stealthy movements. If it was not for that mysterious person who lured the two remaining experts of the Tang Family away, and also our fourteen brothers who sacrificed their lives to guard our escape, I fear\u2026\u201d After a sigh, he started coughing.\u201cHowever, this item is of great importance. There is no room for error. We must hurry up and return this item to the master. We must finish up this matter as soon as possible; only then can we let our guard down. The next few days would certainly be chaotic! Do not delay anymore, be careful of any possible interruptions and move!\u201d\u201cIndeed, indeed. However, Brother Lang, in order for us to infiltrate the Tang Family earlier, your brother-in-law had helped us. What would happen if the Tang Family found out? I fear that your brother-in-law would be unable to escape\u2026\u201d\u201cThere is no need to fear! By the time they find out about it, us brothers would have collected our rewards and have long left this place for another. I do not believe the Tang family has the capabilities to find us,! As for my brother-in-law, the world is not a small place. I believe he is long gone by now. Like hell, the Tang family is able to catch him! That guy is a slippery one, if you have time to worry about him, you might as well worry more about yourself!\u201d\u201cVery true.\u201dThe six people moved forward in a hurry, each step bringing them closer towards Jun Mo Xie. Watching from the side, Jun Mo Xie observed that among the six people, four of them had suffered serious injuries while the injuries suffered by the other two were not light either. As they moved, blood continuously flowed out from them. Two of them were coughing non-stop, each cough resulting in the ground being splattered with the colour of crimson. However, the crimson colour was immediately washed away by the rainwater.What exactly did they steal from the Tang Family? Was it really so important? They sent in twenty people, only having six of them escape while the other fourteen died. And the six people who escaped suffered such serious injuries yet they are able to feel so proud of what they had done?If the Tang Family had obtained something good, would Tang Yuan not show it off first?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSuddenly, the one who seemed to have suffered the most grievous of injuries stopped moving. He coughed out before snapping.\u201cWho is it? Reveal yourself!\u201dWith a thunderous gaze, he shifted his attention towards Jun Mo Xie\u2019s direction. His body suddenly emitted Xuan Qi coloured with the luxurious silver, fully ready to strike at any moment!The person who was suffering the most grievous injuries was actually a Silver Xuan Qi expert!Furthermore, he had also managed to detect Jun Mo Xie\u2019s presence!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Only then could they be considered to have stepped onto the starting line of experts! In the Xuan Xuan Continent, Xuan Qi cultivation was a widespread practice. Even the normal soldiers of the military would have cultivated themselves in Xuan Qi. However, a majority of them would be unable to breach the bottleneck of the Ninth level, doomed to be unable to move forward!That was why none of the experts of the Jun family was unable to refute what Jun Mo Xie had said to them. More than eighty percent of the three hundred men possessed cultivation of the Eighth level, some were even at the peak of the Eighth level. However, not a single one of them could attain the next step, the Ninth level Xuan Qi. It was a measly difference of a single level, and yet the distance towards that level was like Heaven and Earth!A similar bottleneck existed between the Ninth level and the Silver level. The members of these two groups were separated by a huge chasm! Nine and below was nothing but ants! This phrase alone was enough for people to understand the difference! It was from the Silver level onwards that a huge difference would emerge in their Xuan Qi cultivation!The other five men also stopped in their tracks. Six sharp gazes pierced through the rain; the bodies of the five men radiated with a dense black glow. These five men were actually at the peak of the Ninth level! As for the man in the front, his whole body had a brilliant silver glow. This man was obviously a peak Silver Xuan Qi expert, one who was about to step into the realm of the Gold level, and the one to detect Jun Mo Xie\u2019s presence.No wonder they would be able to steal something from the Tang Family. They selected a time when its strength was at its weakest,\u00a0and then sending in twenty capable experts; it was obvious they had already known the location of the item beforehand, prepared a plan prior to the heist and did it with an insider.If they still could not pull off this heist under such conditions, then the strength that the Tang Family possessed would be absolute. However, among the twenty experts sent in, only these six were able to escape. Assuming that the fourteen men who had to died were all at the Ninth Xuan Qi cultivation, then the strength of the Tang Family was something to be proud of!At this moment, the heavy rain was still pouring down endlessly. The rain and dense fog had caused both sides to be unable to observe the situation clearly. Not to mention, they were now currently in the late afternoon of autumn.Jun Mo Xie felt anger at his current strength. It was far too little; even though he had tried to conceal his presence, he was unable to conceal himself as well as his past life, one which was perfect! It seemed that he would have to face an uphill battle today! However, with his current level of strength, could he defeat these six experts? He had absolutely no confidence in even defeating only one of them, much less six of them! It was unfortunate that he had already been witness to their crimes. There was not even an option of running away. At this point in time, they would want nothing more than to kill him to silence him as insurance. In order to preserve his life, he will need to come up with some other methods.Once the dignified king of assassins, he had now found himself caught in such an unreasonable situation. How laughable!While reflecting upon his gloomy situation, Jun Mo Xie came to a realization, a very important one. This realization caused him who was depressed to make a break into a grin, so much so that he might end up laughing with joy. Although his six opponents were all experts with strength surpassing his own, Jun Mo Xie had found an assured method of victory!Jun Mo Xie\u2019s body was hidden by the rain and fog, which made the six men unable to figure out how many people were watching them. They only knew somebody was watching them, but not how many, and definitely not the appearance of Jun Mo Xie. Thus, all of them remained cautious, unwilling to make a single reckless movement! After all, they had just emerged from a bloody battle, having lost a suffered severe injuries and thus, losing much of their capabilities. Any carelessness on their part could bring about a fatal disaster!But the same could not be said for Jun Mo Xie! For him, there was currently no difference between now and day! It may be more accurate to say that it was even clearer than day for him!The Art of Unlocking Heaven\u2019s Fortune was an extremely mysterious art, one that was shrouded in mystery. However, Jun Mo Xie had only practised it for around one month, his cultivation shallow and was naturally unable to understand its intricacies. As such, he was unable to see well in the darkness. But, the six men before him had channelled the Xuan Qi to the limit, causing their bodies to radiate brightly in the foggy rain with an unmistakable silver and black glow, as though fearful that their opponent would be unable to spot them. In his eyes, they had transformed into six beautifully crafted target dummies!Jun Mo Xie felt like a ship that had lost its way in an endless ocean, suddenly found a lighthouse in front of it! With such a degree of radiance, even an ordinary missile will surely hit its mark!Jun Mo Xie had found the biggest flaw of this world\u2019s Xuan Qi; it was just too eye-catching! Sneak attacks could be performed! In order to battle, one must first channel the Xuan Qi within their bodies. But once the Xuan Qi has been gathered, the body would end up emitting a radiant glow! When matched against the best assassin, Jun Mo Xie, these six men were no different from six naked pigs, waiting to be butchered with a dignified expression!It was no wonder that nobody suspected anything back when Jun Mo Xie had cheated during the game of dice. As long as one had practised up to the Fifth level Xuan Qi, it would be possible to cheat as well. However, doing so would cause their bodies to emit a radiant glow! Unless the cheater was a Supreme God expert, whom would not fall so low as to require to cheat in gambling.\u201cThe one who created this Xuan Qi cultivation method was simply a genius! How did that person know that I would end up transmigrating here and face this kind of situation? This method was simply made for my sake so that I can have an easy and convenient time in killing people! This method is simply the most well-suited cultivation method for my enemies!\u201d In Jun Mo Xie\u2019s opinion, if these six men were pigs, then Xuan Qi at this moment was pig\u2019s feed! Only after having eaten a good amount of pig\u2019s feed would pigs be able to grow to the desirable plump and fat shape.Not just that, they would even take the initiative to rush to the butcher, showing off its plump and fat body, as though it was proudly saying: \u201cCan you see? See how fat I am? Come, it\u2019s time to butcher me! I am ready whenever you are!\u201dAnd Jun Mo Xie\u2019s current role, was none other than this butcher.Naturally, killing pigs would require some skill! That was because the pigs before him were not that easy to kill. A small lapse in concentration would cause him to take a blow from them! As of now, the body state of this \u201cbutcher\u201d was still too weak, unable to endure even a single blow from them!Moving his long sleeves, he tilted, his muscles flexing in coordination with his movements. Eighteen pieces of coin-shaped darts which were hidden on his chest fell silently onto Jun Mo Xie\u2019s palms. Jun Mo Xie then remained motionless, his eyes emitting a bloodthirst!Fully channelling the energy flow of the Art of Unlocking Heaven\u2019s Fortune, he poured the energies from his meridians into the coin-shaped darts\u2026In this autumn afternoon filled with rain where the world had darkened, the king of assassins from another world bared his fangs for the first time! This was the first time since arriving in this strange world that he would reveal his artistic killing techniques!\u201cSplash, splash.\u201d The sound of footsteps slowly sounded out as the six men moved through the rain, they gradually spilt themselves up, putting some distance between each other, as they moved to flank Jun Mo Xie\u2019s position. All of them could feel that this person before them was still here, and had not made a single movement! This person must not be allowed to live! Regardless of who this person may be, they must eradicate him! That was the singular thought in their minds.Amidst the heavy rain and fog, the person before them seemingly made his move. After which, they all saw six brilliant yellow lights emerging from the rain. These six lights flew like lightning, each aimed at the throats of each of the six men!The unique energies that Jun Mo Xie had poured into the coin-shaped darts, caused them to radiate an eye-catching brilliance, bright to the extreme!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOnce the yellow light appeared, all six of them felt a chill running down their spines! Their bodies stiffening, their minds shocked beyond belief! One of them stared with bulging eyes and muttered in a despairing voice. \u201cEarth Xuan\u2026\u201dWhat kind of person can emit such a brilliant yellow light? With such speed and vigour. With the exception of an Earth Xuan Ranked expert, no other stages can emit this type of Xuan Qi and light!The Gold Xuan was above the Silver Xuan, and above it was the Jade Xuan, and only above the Jade Xuan was there the Earth Xuan! Such a difference in power was like Heaven and Earth, incomparable and impossible to bridge! This\u2026 How were they supposed to fight this battle?They wanted to silence this person? It seemed that they were about to be silenced by him!If they were at their tip top condition and faced a Gold Xuan expert, they may not even be able to compete with him. But now that all of them had suffered such grievous injuries, they actually bumped into an Earth Xuan expert?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They had not noticed that the person before did not even have the overwhelming aura of a true Earth Xuan expert!The overwhelming feeling of despair caused a momentary lapse of judgement from these six men. However, it was also this small moment, which sealed their fate!This was the reason why Jun Mo Xie shot out those coin shaped darts filled with the unique colour of radiance. He had predicted the occurrence of such a moment! For one to be a great assassin, he must have an insight on how the opponent would think. According to Jun Mo Xie\u2019s calculations, should these six men encounter an expert they could not defeat, they would act as if had been caught in a quicksand! This moment was what Jun Mo Xie was waiting for!When a Silver Xuan expert who was just injured suddenly met a peak Earth Xuan expert, he would face an unthinkable fear and horror! This feeling was like waiting for an inevitable death! Furthermore, these men were in the midst of being hunted, it was a matter of fact that these feelings would rise up exponentially.This one small moment was what Jun Mo Xie was looking for!If he had directly attacked without any tricks, then three of these six men would be able to dodge his attack. Rather than the strength of a well-aimed dart, he had split the strength between six darts, which will far lesser! Even if only one of them survived, Jun Mo Xie would be in for a world of hurt! They may all be injured, but any one of them was more than a match for Jun Mo Xie.The reason why none of \u2018Xiaoli Feidao\u2019s Flying Daggers\u2019 was issued in vain was because only one was issued each time!Jun Mo Xie\u2019s focus was naturally on the Silver Xuan expert. Even though he was seriously injured, he was still the one with the highest amount of pressure! He was also keen enough to notice Jun Mo Xie\u2019s presence!After the six dazzling coin shaped darts appeared, twelve dark grey lights secretly flew out. However, the six pieces of darts had already attracted their undivided attention. In addition, the heavy downpour hid the dark grey lights away. All six of them had all panicked as they dodged the six incoming darts. None of them dared to block the darts with their weapons, fearing the internal damage that might result from the strength of an \u2018Earth Xuan expert\u2019!In truth, were those projectile weapons really sent out by an \u2018Earth Xuan expert\u2019, none a single one of them would even have the opportunity to take a glimpse of the yellow radiance before being killed off. Not even the strongest one, the Silver Xuan expert was exempted! Unfortunately, in their state of shock, none of them thought of this fact!Even after moving to dodge the incoming projectiles, two miserable screams echoed out. They were unable to avoid the coin-shaped dart in time and it pierced the area above their collarbone, their blood sprayed out as they fell to the ground. Those who had fallen to the ground even believed themselves to be already dead. Having taken a blow from an Earth Xuan expert, what can they who were only at the Ninth level do but await obediently for their deaths? Not to mention, those darts had already pierced their throats\u2026 they did not notice that the darts had only penetrated the area above their collarbone and did not even cut off their windpipes!Following the second wave of projectiles, four more screams echoed out into the night. Twelve flying daggers struck either their throats or their foreheads. Those four men who had just dodged the coin shaped darts had their bodies struck by at least two daggers each, every one of them piercing their vital parts! Their faces expressed a look of disbelief as they tightly gripped onto the hilt of the dagger on their throats; their bodies remained upright as they fell face first onto the ground.As for the Silver Xuan expert which received Jun Mo Xie\u2019s utmost \u201ccare\u201d, his situation was far more miserable in comparison for he had already been grievously injured to begin with. His head and body were pierced with up to four daggers! All of them penetrated so deep that not even the handle of the daggers could be seen!Even upon their death, they were unable to understand why. Didn\u2019t they already avoid that first fatal strike? Why did they suddenly suffer from another mortal wound from these flying daggers? As an Earth Xuan expert, facing off against them whose existence was akin to ants, once his first strike had failed, then considering his status, should have stopped attacking. Why did he attack again? Why?He actually utilized sneak attacks against people who were two whole levels below him. Moreover, after the first attack failed, he actually sent in a second one\u2026 Could it be that the current group of Earth Xuan experts were all shameless bastards without any bearings? In this world, Earth Xuan experts were all individuals who placed utmost importance on their reputations. Since when did they become so shameless?The \u2018Earth Xuan expert\u2019, Jun Mo Xie, showed no hesitation as he moved in with lightning speed, smoothly pulling out the flying dagger from the forehead of a corpse. He then rushed towards the two men who had fallen prior and viciously stabbed one of them directly in his heart!Although these two men had suffered no small amount of injury, it was not enough to be instantly fatal. As of now, they were only at a loss for what to do due to their fear, they still had possessed a certain level of combat capabilities. An enemy who can still pose a threat must not be allowed to live! Even if they were on the verge of death! What happened to him in his previous life was the greatest lesson for Jun Mo Xie! The only enemies who cannot threaten him are those who are dead! Killing intent surged from Jun Mo Xie, his face cold!The flying dagger was tightly gripped by Jun Mo Xie, the tip of his feet positioned outwards. At the same time, the dagger had stabbed into the first man, he started moving. The hand used to stab earlier loosened as he hurled himself to the next victim. Like a cyclone, he launched his other hand downwards, forming a cleaver, hacking into the man\u2019s throat!This series of actions were performed in quick succession, enough to cause the average man to miss out on it. The very moment that the yellow coin shaped darts flew out, Jun Mo Xie\u2019s had already moved. When the four men cried out miserably, Jun Mo Xie was already pulling out the flying dagger from one man\u2019s head. Even before the four dead bodies fell flat onto the ground, the flying dagger had already found its way into the heart of the first survivor. After that, his other hand had also cleaved the throat of the second and last survivor!The man who was pierced in the heart by the dagger did not even have the luxury of making a single sound as he died on the spot!Finally, the cracking sound coming from the last target whose throat had been fractured resounded out at the same time that the sound of four bodies hitting the ground was heard!After completing his actions, Jun Mo Xie stood up as he gasped for breath. Using his current strength, the movements that he did had far exceeded what he was capable of! The original Jun Mo Xie had simply caused too many problems for this body. If it wasn\u2019t for the shedding and his constant exercise during the past month, there was no way he could have managed to do the earlier set of actions.The amount of time he had before was simply too short, he was unable to gain enough strength and what he had done was like exceeding his bank limit. Once his spiritual force had his tension relaxed, he was bombarded by the backlash from the violent movements made earlier. He felt pain assailing him from every part of the body, his muscles and bones felt as though it tearing itself apart.The last survivor coughed as he spat out blood, spraying directly at Jun Mo Xie\u2019s face. As their eyes locked, he stared with resentment at Jun Mo Xie, hissing. \u201cYou\u2026 you are not an\u2026 Ear-\u201d It was only at his moment of death did he came to realize that this person before him was definitely not an Earth Xuan expert!\u201cYou bunch of pig heads!\u201d Jun Mo Xie sighed, feeling pity for him. \u201cIf I was really an Earth Xuan expert, would I need to resort to sneak attacks against you bunch of trash?\u201dThe man\u2019s throat released a series of strange sounds as his eyes suddenly glinted with fury, an expression of resentment and rage on his face! His body arched forward, his body which was at the end of its life suddenly found the strength to lift a trembling hand, pointing at Jun Mo Xie.He seemed as though he wanted to say something but not a sound came out. He simply stared at Jun Mo Xie.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euNot long after, he fell back onto the ground with a thud. After twitching for a bit, he finally breathed his last; his eyes wide open, even to his death.Originally, he still had some strength left which would have made it possible for him to survive a little longer. Who could have known that Jun Mo Xie\u2019s words had instead provoked him to his death!Moving around, Jun Mo Xie retrieved the coin-shaped darts and daggers. At the same time, he also conducted a search on their bodies. Jun Mo Xie\u2019s actions were natural, as though he was merely checking his own pockets, completely disregarding the fact that those six men were dead.His training in his previous life had embedded within him a calmness, which not break even if Mount Tai were to collapse before him. Besides, Jun Mo Xie had witnessed far more situations that were far bloodier than this\u2026He finally found a small parcel in the hands of the Silver Xuan expert. After weighing it for a bit, Jun Mo Xie then reached out for the bamboo hat, which was on the ground. Placing it beneath his rib area, he strode off, turning into the corner. Behind him, the heavy rain continued, creating a huge curtain, cutting off Jun Mo Xie from this bloody scene as though they were of two different worlds!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

One of the corpses had its eyes wide open, staring furiously towards the skies, as though cursing the skies\u2026After taking a few detours, Jun Mo Xie finally made his way back to his residence.Even as Jun Mo Xie strolled ahead, the rain continued falling without restraint. The blood on Jun Mo Xie\u2019s face had already been washed by the rain, the only thing one would see was a few brownish stains. No one would have guessed that those stains were the blood of six highly skilled experts!Besides, there was no way that Jun Mo Xie could have fought against those men with his current level of strength. After all, these were the blood of a Silver Xuan expert and five Ninth Xuan experts!At the same moment that Jun Mo Xie stepped into the Jun Residence, just like a rocket streaking through the skies, a tall figure arrived at the corner where the six corpses could be seen lying on the ground.Filled with surprise, the person rushed towards them, using a hand to comb through the six men, searching their bodies but his efforts were for nought. Straightening his body, the person\u2019s face was extremely gloomy.This man wore a peculiar looking mask, making it hard for one to remember his facial features. However, every move of his was done with supreme calmness and ease. With a golden glow, he flew up to a big tree located fifteen meters away from them. Standing on the tree, he looked around. A sense of effortlessness and ease could be seen in his actions.A golden glow could be seen, the sign of a Gold Xuan expert!His gaze was like lightning, inspecting the surroundings. Suddenly, he flew down from the tree and moved towards the six corpses. He circled the six bodies as he analysed it.After which he moved towards one of the directions where the blood still could be seen flowing. However, his movement speed was far superior compared to that of the usual experts, his speed exceeding what experts could achieve when running!That direction was none other than the direction that Jun Mo Xie had taken when he left this place!This person was truly shrewd; amidst the heavy flow of rainwater, he had actually managed to pinpoint the right direction!The man followed the traces and moved forward. After moving for a while, he suddenly stopped and let out a curse. Jun Mo Xie had actually led him around in circles through using detours! After following the traces left by Jun Mo Xie, the mysterious Gold Xuan expert found himself back at the same starting spot\u2026\u201cWho was it? Who could it be? Having such a sublime thought process!\u201d The man whispered to himself; he raised his head to the skies, his mind lost in thoughts.Who was it who disrupted my plan?Who was it that could have seized this opportunity with such precision?Who could have seen through my plans?Who was it that could read my mind?The execution of this plan was something done at the spur of the moment, not even he himself could have predicted that this would happen. In addition, there was the sudden heavy rain! Considering these factors, the problem could not possibly have originated from his end. But then, where did it come from? Could it be\u2026The mysterious man painstakingly analysed, poring through every variable, going so far as to suspect everyone around him in his analysis\u2026This man\u2019s thoughts have always been deep and profound; every factor must be within the palm of his hands before a decision was made. His obsession towards detail could be said to have reached the extreme!Take what had happened today for example, even if he was beaten to his death, he would never suspect that there would be such a coincidence! As such, his mind was fixed from the very beginning.The incident today must have been the work of someone or some organization, perhaps his own family was trying to sabotage his plans or perhaps someone with an enmity towards his family!His thoughts sprouted out with this point of view as its base. It was only natural that all the possibilities in his mind were wrong, so much so that it could be said to be of hundreds and thousands of kilometres in difference!This man could never have considered that what happened today was simply a coincidence! A very interesting coincidence!If the Silver Xuan expert had not detected Jun Mo Xie\u2019s presence, then Jun Mo Xie would never have chosen to incur the wrath of others while his strength had yet to bloom.If the person the Silver Xuan expert had detected was not Jun Mo Xie but a commoner, then he would have been able to safely deliver the item back to the designated place.If this person had arrived just a few moments earlier, there was no way Jun Mo Xie could have beaten the man with his current level of strength\u2026Everything that had happened was all a coincidence. Coincidences were the inevitable problem for all developments. The world could never follow the will of men!Although Jun Mo Xie taking away the item that the man wanted was due to a coincidence, Jun Mo Xie did not even know what the item was, or what could it have been used for!Jun Mo Xie deciding to go out for a walk was a coincidence itself. When he realized that the Mid-Autumn Festival of his previous life was approaching, he felt himself becoming nostalgic and homesick.In this world, there was no one he could have a good chat with; there was also no place like the bars in his past life. It would also be inappropriate for him to become depressed at home, not to mention Jun Mo Xie was not one to let others see himself being submerged in such weak emotions. Thus, he went out, planning to drink away his sorrows.Unexpectedly, a middle-aged man\u2019s words caused him to lose the will to continue, the wine becoming less appealing and harder to stomach. After saying a few contemptuous words, he left the wine shop.Still feeling down, Jun Mo Xie wandered through the streets, as though this act could bring some level of comfort for him.It was then which the \u201ccoincidence\u201d occurred!After a series of coincidences, Jun Mo Xie ended up bumping into those men who had stolen the item from the Tang Family. Those few men who barely escaped, coincidentally also stopped for a while, allowing Jun Mo Xie to listen in on their conversations.With his current level of strength, Jun Mo Xie had intended to simply forget about this incident. After all, the current Jun Mo Xie had no particular feelings for the Tang Family. If the Tang Family lost something, then so be it!It had nothing to do with him, regardless of what it might be. Who could have known that those people would be able to notice Jun Mo Xie\u2019s presence? This left Jun Mo Xie with no other choice; with consideration to the strength of these robbers, he was unable to run away.With no other choices, Jun Mo Xie resorted to using his projectiles, depending on the cover from the heavy rain and fog, together with the prediction of how the man would react and had them killed in one swift moment!Since those men were dead, there was no reason for Jun Mo Xie not to help himself and take the item from them. As such, the critical item that the mysterious person eagerly desired fell into the hands of Jun Mo Xie through a series of amazing coincidence.None of these things seemed to be remarkable. Yet, when they all came together, these series of coincidences could cause anyone to jump in shock!Gaining great benefits without knowing what was going on!Ruining other people\u2019s meticulous plans as he strolled around aimlessly!For so many coincidences to have occurred, this was just like a divine intervention, even the Heavens decided to roll the ultimate dice, the heavy rain, to add to the fun. This could only be labelled as Heaven\u2019s will, or perhaps the director of these \u201ccoincidences\u201d could be called Heavens!The mysterious man remained there and was just about to leave when he heard a roaring noise. The Tang Family\u2019s house guards were charging over.With a sigh, his body radiated a golden glow as he made his move. Six loud splats were heard, as the heads of the six corpses below exploded, their faces unrecognizable even by their parents! Brushing his sleeves, the man jumped into the rain and disappeared.When the Tang Family\u2019s men came over, all they saw was six corpses with blood and gore replacing their heads. As for the item that they needed to recover?It was nowhere to be found\u2026Jun Mo Xie remained ignorant to the fact that he had somehow foiled the plan of his family\u2019s greatest enemy. He even retrieved the precious item that the mysterious man desired.Jun Mo Xie only felt aggrieved.I had originally only wanted to enjoy the rainy atmosphere, reflect on the memories of my old world, immerse myself in this emotion of nostalgic loneliness.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euInstead, I had to bump into a whole lot of rotten bastards, destroying my mood and feelings! Sigh, how depressing\u2026Not a single thing went right! First, I went to drink wine but bumped into a man who cannot differentiate between good and bad wine, claiming that such an inferior wine is a masterpiece.How pitifully laughable!And then, after that, I left to enjoy the rainy atmosphere instead, but then went ahead and bumped into a bunch of people trying to kill me\u2026What bad luck!\u00a0Jun Mo Xie sighed as he raised his head to the skies.

Jun Mo Xie walked leisurely, causing those who saw him through the door or the windows to wonderOh, God! What kind of madness is the Young Master up to now?Well, compared to his previous sort of trouble, the ones nowadays seemed more reasonable, although it does seem rather peculiar.What was he doing outside when it is raining cats and dogs?As he was passing by the gardens, he suddenly heard the melody of a flute slowly emanating from within.Within the melody of the flute was an unforgettable sorrow.Listening to the sound of the flute, one could imagine the sorrow and hidden feelings of resentment filled in the person playing the flute.But when Jun Mo Xie heard the sound, he felt that it coincided with his current mood. Unable to control himself, he went towards the source of the tune.In a pavilion situated in the middle of the garden, a woman with white robes sat on a stone bench, her back facing Jun Mo Xie. Her hair rolled up high like dark clouds, her waist slender; looking at her from behind, one would only think that she was a cold but refined woman. However, to be accompanied by such a mournful melody from the cold flute in this desolate autumn, it would appear that this woman was also lonely and dismal.Jun Mo Xie stood quietly in the rain, he closed his eyes slightly, listening to the sorrow filled tune coming from the flute. His mind fell into a trance, as though he was listening to his favourite song from his past life, the song \u201cWang Ning Mei\u201d from the famous, Dream of the Red Chamber, that same graceful sorrow and tearful resentment\u2026Jun Mo Xie\u2019s felt a bout of maudlin going through his head.In this heavy autumn rain, for whom were this pain and sorrow for?At this moment, Jun Mo Xie suddenly felt that the woman before him was suffering the same solitary loneliness as him! However, when compared to himself, hers was one that was far more helpless.Amidst the sorrowful resentment of the flute\u2019s melody, even the wind became suffocating\u2026The flute\u2019s melody gradually became weaker, just like a thread of silk swaying in the air, swaying until there was nothing. The white-robed woman remained seated; she placed down the jade flute and faintly sighed. The sound of her sigh was covered by the sound of the rain, showing how weak it was in comparison.Jun Mo Xie\u2019s heart moved, he could not help but also let out a gentle sigh.Even though the sound was light, the woman became shocked. She immediately turned around, her gaze locking onto Jun Mo Xie.Her face showed surprise, then, faint disgust as she looked at Jun Mo Xie with contempt.\u201cIt is you.\u201d\u201cThe flute melody is not bad, very beautiful.\u201dJun Mo Xie smiled as he leisurely stepped into the pavilion. His rain-soaked body caused the floor of the pavilion to become wet.\u201cSister-in-law, how did you suddenly have this elegant interest?\u201dThe woman\u2019s looks were as if from a painting.Her bearing was graceful and dignified, but her face cold and aloof. The contrast made more obvious by her history.This woman who was graceful yet cold was none other than Jun Mo Xie\u2019s sister-in-law and Jun Mo You\u2019s wife, Guan Qing Han.She was the only daughter of the famed Guan Family, a well-known family in the Tianxiang Kingdom.In truth, calling her Mo You\u2019s wife may be inappropriate. Their engagement was something that was set when they were both still toddlers. Three years ago, Jun Mo You was twenty-two and Guan Qing Han was eighteen. It was then when the two families began preparing for the marriage between the two.However, a war suddenly erupted with the Shenci Kingdom. Jun Mo You and his little brother, Jun Mo Chou, were selected to join the expedition against Shenci. Thus the two families decided to hold the marriage after Jun Mo You returned victoriously.Before Jun Mo You left for the army, they had already finished with the engagement ceremony and Guan Qing Han was already considered a member of the Jun Family. Once Jun Mo You returned, their wedding would take place. As for the wedding date, that too was already set in stone.However, none of them would have expected that Jun Mo You would never return, his body left to rest upon the battlefield. The two childhood sweethearts were now separated, faced with regrets forever!A precious talent, dying in an unclear and pitiful manner!When the bad news arrived, Guan Qing Han fainted on the spot. After that, she disregarded her family\u2019s advice and chose to enter the Jun Family. She adopted the identity of a widow of the Jun Family and helped in taking care of the elder in the Jun Family. Grandpa Jun had asked her not to a number of times.After all, there was no need to fear not being able to have a good marriage due to her good looks and background. He had even proposed breaking off the engagement to allow Guan Qing Han to gain freedom from this situation.But Guan Qing Han persistently refused. Even after exhausting themselves, the elders of both families were unable to change her mind. All they could do was wait. Should the time ever came when she changed her mind, then they would send her back to the Guan Family.Everyone in the Jun Family from the elderly Grandpa Jun, Jun Wu Yi all the way down to the servants treated this young maiden with respect, not slighting her off in any way. However, there was one person who constantly made her unhappy, and that was her little brother-in-law, Jun Mo Xie!After his beautiful sister-in-law moved in, the prodigal debauchee, Jun Mo Xie became restless, his manner of speech flippant, his bearing frivolous, causing Guan Qing Han to feel extremely disgusted. Unable to tolerate him, she had once given him a harsh lesson. Even though she was the only daughter, she was quite proficient in martial arts.While not at Silver Xuan, she was already at the peak of the Ninth level Xuan!Dealing with someone like Jun Mo Xie was hardly a difficult task.However, the beatings did nothing to change this self-indulgent brat. Knowing that his beautiful sister-in-law would not inflict heavy injuries upon him, he would always peep at her secretly. Seeing such a thick-skinned person, Guan Qing Han was unable to find a way and chose to simply hide in her room most of the time.However, due to today\u2019s rain, her heartfelt bitter and sorrowful, affecting her emotionally. Thus, she decided to go to the pavilion to express her sorrow with the flute. Unexpectedly, this debauchee would brave the rain to come over!What an obsessive person, do you not understand that my Ninth Xuan Qi is far higher than yours? It would not take much of an effort to take care of someone like you! The reason I choose not to, was simply because I did not want to disturb the peace of this residence, and also to not cause gramps any heartaches. Did you think I was afraid of you?Hearing Jun Mo Xie\u2019s words, Guan Qing Han felt even more disgusted,\u201cOh, I just have nothing to do at the moment and decided to play the flute for a bit. Could it be that Third Young Master is an expert on this subject?\u201d One could clearly hear the undisguised barbs in her words.What does this debauchee\u00a0know\u00a0about the melody of a flute? Beautiful? Not bad? He is obviously trying to strike up a conversation with me! She stared at him coldly, wondering what kind of new \u201cface\u201d was he intending to show today.With Jun Mo Xie\u2019s wisdom, how could he not understand the meaning behind her words? However, this woman was someone he admired. Not mentioning, how he knew how insufferable the original Jun Mo Xie was. It was no wonder everyone would look down upon him! On the other hand, Guan Qing Han\u2019s affectionate devotion was something that Jun Mo Xie found himself respecting.\u201cThe melody of the flute comes from the heart, the past is but the past, it would be better for sister-in-law let go of the past. Let bygones be bygones,\u201d Jun Mo Xie hesitated slightly before replying.Guan Qing Han gave out a \u2018hmph\u2019 before turning her body to the side, ignoring him.Jun Mo Xie began losing interest. If someone chose to ignore him, then he would simply ignore them even more!So what if she was a beautiful woman?Can beauties simply throw disdainful looks at others?\u201cI was presumptuous earlier, causing a disturbance for sister-in-law. I will go back now.\u201d Having reluctantly said that, he smiled, turning around and walked away without hesitation. You are going to ignore me? That is fine. I will just go to sleep.Guan Qing Han became greatly surprised.She originally thought that he was planning to stalk her again, using false pretences to get near her. Unexpectedly, he actually said some humane words. He even chose to leave on his own regardless of the rain.Observing Jun Mo Xie\u2019s back as he left through the rain, Guan Qing Han opened her mouth, but then hesitated; gazing at him again, she found that her little brother-in-law seemed really different today.This brat had always had his eyes filled with dishonesty, never sporting eye contact while having a nasty roguish grin plastered on his face.Whenever he saw her, he would drool in an unbearable manner.However, his earlier actions did not show any trace of his previous frivolousness and were instead solemn, a very\u2026 calm and profound demeanour.Furthermore, his eyes did not stare upon her at all. Observing his back as he left through the rain, she saw that he remained calm\u2026Did he really change?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGuan Qing Han inwardly gave a cold sneer.Since his usual actions did not yield any results, he decided to change tactics and wear the face of a \u2018gentlemen\u2019 to trick me? Hmph! Jun Mo Xie, did you expect me to believe your act that easily? Even if your act has a thousand changes, in my heart, you will forever be the dirty, shameless prodigal debauchee! That will never change!Even with such a heavy rain, you actually allowed yourself to be drenched as you came over here only to say those few sentences? As if anyone would believe that? This could only prove that you have hidden motive for your actions! You, a gentleman? Who would believe that?Guan Qing Han\u2019s beautiful face instantly turned ice cold!However, this brat actually did not show any fear when he saw me glaring at him today\u2026 hmph!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Guan Qing Han was only twenty-one, just reaching the prime in her life. Moreover, she was also a heaven stunning beauty. However, she still chose to enter the Jun Family to become a widow! If this was his old world, this kind of occurrence was simply unbelievable!However, it seemed to be a natural way of life here. This was truly a great loss.This is simply a waste of resources! If only I could\u2026 Eh?This thought suddenly emerged from Jun Mo Xie\u2019s mind, startling him.How could I have such a disgusting thought? I may sympathize my sister-in-law but I would never think of something like this unless\u2026You despicable Jun Mo Xie! Your soul had already left, and yet you still left this kind of residual effect!\u00a0Jun Mo Xie cursed inwardly.Jun Mo Xie walked into his room. Without acknowledging the young girl\u2019s greeting, he sat down with a frown on his face.He started to reflect on every single action he had taken since the day he moved to this world, and something didn\u2019t feel right.In his previous life, he had also shown a frivolous side of him, but it was meant as a method of getting close to the target or as a cover. No matter what, it was only an act.Jun Mo Xie\u2019s true character had always been cold and arrogant, and could even be called ruthless.At times, he could even be described as unfeeling. However, he came to realize that his personality had drastically changed ever since he transmigrated over.Admittedly, Jun Mo Xie\u2019s original identity as a trouble-making debauchee was the best possible cover. However, he needed to have a good grasp on his own state of mind!I cannot allow the original character of this body, of Jun Mo Xie, to prevail! Yet, I still need this character to act as cover!Maintain my state of mind, complying with the outer layer, and yet deep down, I am still me\u2026 The Evil Monarch, Jun Mo Xie!A burst of light shot forth from his eyes, heartless before Heaven and Earth, tens of thousands were mere fodder in his eyes! The true and ruthless Evil Monarch has stepped into this other world!Having resolved himself, he felt his body relaxing and was instantly reminded of other things. He removed the small parcel from his bosom.This parcel was obtained at the expense of twenty experts. Even though he did not know who the mastermind was, Jun Mo Xie was confident that no ordinary man would dare steal from the Tang Family. In addition, such a huge risk would not be taken unless the object was of considerable value!Having such thoughts running through his mind, Jun Mo Xie could not help but feel highly curious. He had originally thought of returning it to the Tang Family however he was now overwhelmed by the desire to open it up.Acting on his desires, this was the Evil Monarch\u2019s way! With a scoff, Jun Mo Xie tore open the parcel. Within it was a square wooden box; a box that emitted a faint scent, its top was covered with pale gold lines. This wooden box was surprisingly made of top quality Goldensilk Sandalwood!In addition, the material for this box of Goldensilk Sandalwood was cut out from the tree as a whole! This box alone was worth a fortune!Opening the box, he felt a cold air wafting outwards. Inside the box was another snow-white box. Touching it, he felt a chilling cold. This was a high-grade Cold Jade!Judging by the colour of the box, this Cold Jade was a mysteriously potent object!Jun Mo Xie inhaled deeply! Just what exactly was it that was so important? They even used such a precious Cold Jade to keep it covered.Carefully opening the jade box, he found a round object within the box. The object was wrapped within a layer of colourful skin fur, which possessed a strange sheen. Jun Mo Xie who had no knowledge of what this was did not react at all. However, if a professional were to lay eyes on this, they would likely become shocked. This was the pelt of a Ninth Xuan Beast! A Ninth Xuan Beast was an existence akin to that of a Spirit Xuan expert! Goldensilk Sandalwood box, high-grade Cold Jade and the pelt of a Level 9 Xuan Beast; any of them could be considered a priceless treasure!These three priceless items were actually just part of the package!Jun Mo Xie removed the object wrapped by the layer of pelt with his hand. It was a round object the size of a ping-pong ball. Looking at it, Jun Mo Xie could not help but feel somewhat disappointed.The strange object was dark red and almost black in colour. Its texture resembled that of a stone, yet was not stone, resembled jade, and yet not jade. He gave it a pinch and found it to be slightly elastic. The first impression of the item was but one word \u2013 mediocre!Suddenly, a thought flashed through Jun Mo Xie\u2019s mind and he blurted out.\u201cXuan Core!?\u201dAlthough Jun Mo Xie was unable to identify a Xuan Core, he knew that it was a precious item. Only a Third Xuan Beast or above could produce a Xuan Core. As for this Xuan Core, considering the strength of the Tang Family and how much importance they placed on protecting it and also the amount of attraction it had from others, going so far as to provoke a \u201ctiger\u201d in order to obtain it, this item was no ordinary material! It should at least be from a Seventh Xuan Beast! Or perhaps, even higher?Jun Mo Xie was not aware just how much resources Tang Wan Li had spent in order to obtain this Xuan Core. This Xuan Core came from a Ninth Xuan Golden Winged Tiger Xuan Beast had contained a huge amount of energy.For low-levelled Xuan Qi experts, this Xuan Core was useless. However, once their cultivation was no longer of low level, then under the right conditions and using certain methods of stimulation, the vast energies within could be absorbed and claimed as one\u2019s own!As for how much of the energies can be absorbed?That will have to depend on the person\u2019s talent.Once the Earth rank was reached, every step forward in Xuan Qi cultivation was cumulatively difficult. However, this Xuan Core could boost beginning Earth Xuan expert all the way up to the Sky Xuan stage! Within the world of Xuan Qi, this item was a Heaven defying treasure!The difficulties involved in killing even an Eighth levelled Xuan Beast was already extremely high. As for killing a Ninth levelled Xuan Beast in order to retrieve its Xuan Core? This was generally an impossibility! It was certain that a Spirit Xuan expert held a good chance of defeating a Ninth levelled Xuan Beast, but killing it? Even if two Spirit Xuan experts were to join hands, they may not be able to kill a Ninth levelled Xuan Beast! The strength and speed of a Ninth levelled Xuan Beast was already considered to be terrifying, but when it came to running away, there was no way to compare to it!Not to mention, this was a Gold Winged Tiger, a Xuan Beast with the ability to fly! Stopping it was something one would never even consider.Back then, Tang Wan Li accidentally found a heavily injured Spirit Xuan expert. When he found out that the expert possessed this Xuan Core, Tang Wan Li spent a fortune to hire tens of Jade, Earth and Sky ranked experts in order to snatch it. Several lives were lost before he successfully obtained it.Regardless of how the Spirit Xuan expert had gotten the Xuan Core, claiming it to be the only one in existence may be an exaggeration. However, one can be certain, there will not be more than three in this world.Naturally, the reason Li You Ran urgently desired this Xuan Core was because he had a pressing need to use it!His plan had already began years ago from when he first received intelligence on this matter, involving the bribery of Tang Family\u2019s members, carefully arranging so that he could make his way in step by step, painstakingly keeping his eyes and ears out for any news until three months ago, when he finally found out the secret location of the item. However, Tang Wan Li never left the house and was always protected by four experts, giving him not a single opportunity to strike.This time, he finally chanced upon a rare occasion. Not only did Tang Wan Li leave the house, he even took with him three of the four experts! In addition, there was also the heavy rain, which made the situation even more favourable! Grasping onto these favourable factors, he even sent a first-rate expert to lure away the expert from the Tang Family before secretly sending in another twenty experts. Collaborating with their insider, they had finally gotten it after sacrificing fourteen of the twenty experts!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euEven then, it was considered a huge success. Sacrificing the lives of a few experts in return for the Xuan Core was undoubtedly an advantageous trade!Unfortunately, just before successfully handing over the item, they ended up meeting Jun Mo Xie\u2026Several years\u2019 worth of meticulous planning, thousands of plans and ten thousand analyses, all of them ended with nothing to show for their efforts!It only ended up benefiting others!It was like training a young girl to be your wife, only to have her snatched away on the day you got married!One could only imagine how miserable this Li You Ran currently was!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Instead, He was thinking what explanation he could give if he returned it to the Tang Family.What reason could he use to explain how he got this item.Even if he decided to not return the item, what kind of benefits would it even provide? He didn\u2019t even know what the item was, much less its value!After some time passed, he was still unable to think of anything. Then, he sealed up the Xuan Core and placed it into the Cold Jade box, and back into the Goldensilk Sandalwood box. After weighing it in his hands, he placed it beside his pillow.After considering for some time he pushed it deeper and covered it with his pillow.It was not that he had recognized it as a precious treasure and wanted to keep a close eye on it. But instead, it was because he had heard that the Sandalwood box would be extremely beneficial to his sleep\u2026Once there was a person who had bought a box but ended up unknowingly returning the pearls within it, a extremely hilarious tale! However, Jun Mo Xie\u2019s actions today, were extremely similar.The rain had finally stopped after it reached late night.Tang Wan Li\u2019s grey hair was ramrod straight, his rage soaring past the skies!Even as he controlled himself as he rushed towards the Li Family and Meng Family, intending to raise hell for both of them. But when he had reached the Li Family, he had instead felt like had ran towards a rubber wall and was forced to leave without managing to cause any trouble there.He then decided to focus his rage upon the Meng Family, giving endless troubles there, releasing all the anger built up in him, causing chickens to fly and dogs to jump. Unexpectedly, he was unable to return as an extremely heavy rain had started, causing Tang Wan Li to become even more filled with fury. In retaliation, he then threw an even bigger fit in the Meng Family Residence, cursing everyone to the point of choking on their own spit.How could he have thought that as he was throwing a fit, someone from his place would urgently come and report a stolen item from his residence? At that moment, Tang Wan Li felt as though a bomb exploded in his head as all the blood surged upwards to his head\u2026He came to vent his wrath on others but came to find that his own house was turned upside down by someone else. And it had even been an inside job!Tang Wan Li could guess that the item stolen must be one that he personally valued; otherwise, why would the messenger rush over here through such a weather to inform him! As for which personal valuable item was stolen, there was no need for any discussion, the most valuable could only be the Xuan Core!Although he had thought of it, Tang Wan Li held on the hope that it wasn\u2019t as such and inquired about the stolen item. As long as it was not the Xuan Core, then all will be right.However, what he had feared the most had indeed come true!The Xuan Core, which he valued as much as his own life, was indeed the stolen item! Tang Wan Li\u2019s saw nothing but darkness and he almost fainted right then and there.Ever since he had managed to get it, Tang Wan Li knew that he had a precious treasure in his hands. All that was needed, was for his descendants to focus on cultivation and reach Earth Xuan rank. Which he would then do everything in his capabilities, even throwing his face away, to invite a few Sky Xuan experts or perhaps even a Spirit Xuan Xuan expert to help him out. With their help, the Xuan Core could be utilized to propel his descendants into the Sky Xuan rank!Once that happened, the Tang Family would also prosper as long as the Sky Xuan expert remained alive! As for himself, he was already too old. Even if he were to use the Xuan Core to increase his level of cultivation, an extension of his life was only possible if he could achieve the Spirit Xuan rank, even with the help of the Xuan Core, he did not have the talent required to reach it!How could he have expected the changes that would affect his plans?He had two sons, the first had no talent to speak of, the second was fairly capable but was more interested in literature and disliked martial arts cultivation.He stopped cultivating after reaching a mere Ninth Xuan rank, never bothering to even attempt breaking through into the Silver Xuan rank.Even though his career as a government official had gone smoothly, there was no powerful expert within the family. This feeling where their family\u2019s future and well-being rested upon the hands of others was simply distasteful.The civil and military officials were naturally all under the governance of His Majesty, the Emperor. However, as long as their family has a Sky Xuan expert, then even the Emperor must consider carefully if His Majesty wished to deal with them!Faced with no other options, Tang Wan Li could only place his hopes on his grandsons instead. This time around, his hopes seemed to be well worth it as a few of his grandsons had shown promising talent. With the exception of the eldest grandson, Tang Yuan who preferred business to martial arts, his other three grandsons highly respected the value of Xuan Qi cultivation and worked arduously in regards to Xuan Qi cultivation.This allowed the old Tang Wan Li to feel relieved. He believed that one of his grandsons would be able to step upon the Earth Xuan rank within ten years\u2019 time. As for himself, he was positive that he could continue on for another ten more years.He believed that the positive effect of using the Xuan Core on his grandson would surpass the effect of using it on his son. As long as everything proceeded smoothly, Tang Family would not face any problems from the royal court or outside for a whole century.How could he have foreseen that after waiting for so many years, after enduring thousands of bitter hardships to gather the necessary herbs, after his grandsons had already succeeded in breaking through to the Silver Xuan rank, possibly requiring only a few more years before meeting the necessary requirements, the most critical item ended up being stolen!At this moment, Tang Yuan was in the middle of venting his own anger. Clutching one and a half million worth in silver bills, he grabbed onto Meng Hai Zou\u2019s collar, insisting on redeeming the sword and accompaniment jade. How was Meng Hai Zou to produce them? All he could do was bow profusely and bootlick endlessly, his face dripping with sweat.Feeling helpless at his own predicament, Tang Wan Li issued the command to return home. Feeling irritable and filled with only the thought of reaching home, he lashed out a kick at Tang Yuan who was still ranting non-stop.Before leaving, Tang Yuan hollered at them. If they were unable to produce the precious sword and accompaniment jade in three days\u2019 time, then he would go forward and report it directly to His Majesty, the Emperor. Those words caused Meng Hai Zou lose control of his bowels.Of course, each word he said came at a price, for each word he said, Tang Wan Li gave him two vicious kicks, causing his buttocks to roll around.After hurrying home urgently, Tang Wan Li erupted with anger again. He had every one of the Tang Family\u2019s elite house guards sent out, openly and wantonly searching all corners! As for those sixteen men who were killed trying to escape from the Tang Residence and the six corpses found on the streets, he had them well preserved. In addition to finding people to identify the bodies, he also had their images drawn out and handed over to the Ministry of Justice. Through the Ministry of Justice, he offered a reward of one hundred thousand silver Liangs for any knowledge of these people!As for the few escaped servants from his own residence, the reward for them was double. No matter what, he must capture the mastermind!In a single day, the entire capital was turned upside down.In three days, the entire world was turned upside down!At the same time, Li You Ran and the Li Family showed no external movements on their part, taking on the attitude of a watchful bystander.Secretly, however, they were moving with all their might. Li You Ran had everyone involved strictly interrogated, and anyone that a single hint of suspicious behaviour was tortured brutally without end.Killing a thousand innocents was better than letting go of one criminal!It was important for him to find out who was trying to go against him!After merely two days, many had found themselves unable to cope with the cruel tortures and died! The Li Family\u2019s secret forces too moved out in full force, seeking information from all four corners.All the great families within the capital were able to catch the scent of something unusual within these series of events. All of them kept a close eye on the capital\u2019s movements, guarding themselves from being sucked into this muddy \u201cwhirlpool\u201d. However, they too sent out their men to inquire information. What was going on in the Tang Family?The entire capital\u2019s forces had at this moment, started moving secretly. As for the holding cells of the Ministry of Justice, they were all suddenly filled to the brim! Tang Family\u2019s unrestricted use of its power and influence had caused an \u201cearthquake\u201d within the capital, causing everyone to feel insecure.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAnd yet, no news came forth. Tang Wan Li\u2019s heart was filled with worry and irritation. He threw a fit every day. Li You Ran maintained his gentle demeanour on the outside, however behind his chilling eyes was a different story, a pair of poisonous serpent-like glint could be seen.If his eyes were to lightly gaze upon someone, then that person would die.If his eyes were to stare heavily at someone, then that person\u2019s entire family would be exterminated!As for the person who had reaped the biggest benefit from this ordeal, Jun Mo Xie, remained unaware of what was happening. He was relaxing at home, holding on to the Goldensilk Sandalwood Box while he slept at night, sighing loudly to himself, it turned out that it really did great wonders for his sleep\u2026In his mind, he kept wondering why his mind would wander towards his widowed sister-in-law\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If he wasn\u2019t spending time discovering the properties of the Exquisite Hongjun Pagoda, he would be supervising the training of the house guards.He even went to brew a sizeable amount of wine which was being placed aside for fermentation! Jun Mo Xie only knew what had happened in the city after a few days!Naturally, there was a reason why the Jun Family was able to preserve its tranquillity. Regardless of the Tang Family or the Li Family, neither one had given the Jun Family any more than a suspicious glance.Besides the notorious debauchee, the other members of the Jun Family were either old or crippled. Who could they have sent out?Moreover, Grandpa Jun was a man of honour! His actions were done outrightly without fear. This was a fact that even his opponents had to accept. Naturally, he wouldn\u2019t have done it.As for Jun Mo Xie\u2026 It would be simply too embarrassing for the six experts if one were to suspect Jun Mo Xie! Who would believe that this useless debauchee could have the ability to kill a Silver Xuan expert and five Ninth Xuan expert?However, not everyone in the Jun Family was unscathed!Due to the free time the Young Master had these past few days, he decided to use the time to brutally put the house guards through a skin peeling training program!However, not a single one of them voiced out a complaint!The reason was a simple one \u2013 they felt embarrassed, simply too embarrassed, so much that they could not utter a single word!If each of the house guards had a layer of their skin peeled, then Jun Mo Xie had three layers of his own skin peeled! Perhaps even more than that!During these few days, watching the training that Jun Mo Xie had put himself through caused even the iron blooded Jun Wu Yi to feel a chill down his spine!One example of his schedule daily was this.In the early morning, Jun Mo Xie woke up and proceeded to the courtyard. There he found a hidden corner for him to meditate. As for why he did not do so in his room? It was so that he could be at a place that would allow him to be one with nature, the early morning breeze was a gift from the heavens!An hour later, he strapped on weights to his body, legs, arms and wrists. After which, he began his training of a variety of basic moves.Normal punches, straight punches, hooks, uppercuts; normal kicks, front kicks, roundhouse kicks, side kicks, back kicks. Not a single break was allowed in between sessions.After the set was complete, he immediately moved on to push ups, sit-ups, oblique sit-ups, duck walk, leapfrog, leg stretching, hanging from upside down.After finishing this session, not a single drop of sweat could escape his body any longer!\u00a0The muscles in his entire body were pushed to its limits. If an ordinary person had done this training, even if he was able to preserve to the end, that person would end up being exhausted to death!However, this was but the beginning!After having exercised both his hands and feet, it was finally time to start training in some set of martial arts movements, each performed meticulously!Even if these actions were simply practiced according to style without substance, it would still cause one to be drenched in sweat. After all, each was executed to adhere to a strict standard.Each punch, involved each body part, from the toe and the heel, then to the twisting ankles, the calf muscles, the hamstring, the thigh, and finally the waist. Each muscle would then channel up the momentum up towards the shoulder, which was then sent to the arm. The resulting punch would be one with the strength of the entire body!Each punch was executed with all his strength!A famous martial art clan once said, the simplest kicks and punches was the most important!However, this simple punch and kick must involve all the muscles in the body for it to be actually worth doing!Some punches can take a person\u2019s life, but others would result in the user to sprain their wrists. This was the reason why this could happen!This principle applied to other actions as well.Even if the action only involved a simple punch, it was also a form of martial arts!The basis of martial arts was the training of such simple movements! The pinnacle of it was the same, to become one with nature!This form may be simple but it is the best way of training the mind of a martial artist! As for Jun Mo Xie, he also had his body and limbs strapped with weights, increasing the difficulty by tenfold! The amount of energy needed was far exceeding that!However, this tough training was only the first day of Jun Mo Xie\u2019s formal training! The fierce battle in the rain had given birth the urgent desire of increase his strength \u2013 his body was simply too weak!After completing his morning training program, the Jun Family house guards would assemble before him. Then, there began their hellish training! Jun Mo Xie would also follow them and take part in every training that he had given, starting and finish alongside them!These training plans were the ones from his previous life, made to produce a superhuman assassin, one akin to torture from hell! It was said that some would rather jump willingly into hell than take part in this training!Jun Mo Xie\u2019s fellow assassins once spread out these words in secret.Better to circle King Yama\u2019s palace nine times, than to let the Evil Monarch be in charge of training!Evidently, Jun Mo Xie\u2019s methods of training were simply too monstrous!Jun Mo Xie kept repeating to himself.If I wish to obtain a strength that is unmatchable in the world, I must first have the tenacity and perseverance that is unmatchable in the world.Without that, I might as well forget about it!If I have those qualities, I would then need to work harder and sweat harder compared to others.Otherwise, I might as well forget about it!It was only after these two conditions were fulfilled, can one be qualified to talk about opportunities!

Even if one had the greatest luck in the world, holding onto the most powerful treasure in the universe, without hard work, that person would still amount to nothing in the end!If a soldier was to work hard, then he could be able to eventually leave behind a mark in history as a great general!A general who did not work hard would also leave behind a mark in history, but that mark would be one of great notoriety!In order to subdue others and the whole world, one must first be able to subdue themselves!This was the absolute minimum of conditions!After finishing his morning special training, he had the house guards run twenty laps around the training ground. Jun Mo Xie himself, followed after them! The same went for all other training sessions. With his current body, Jun Mo Xie would be last in every session, but he obstinately persevered to the end!After finishing the first day of training, Jun Mo Xie was exhausted to the realm of consciousness. However, the pride of being the best assassin and the dignity of his title supported him, allowing him to neither bend nor break until the very end!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAlthough this body had undergone the Pulp Rending Meridian Cleanser process, Jun Mo Xie wanted to train his body to the point of perfection as soon as possible! It was only after every muscle in his body had been coordinated accordingly can it be considered to have met Jun Mo Xie\u2019s lowest level of requirements! But how could this be accomplished?Only through blood, sweat and tears!For those without hard work, even if a divine fruit was to fall onto their lap, they would only be crushed by the weight of it! There would be no chance for them to even taste it!Currently, Jun Mo Xie was in the possession of the Nine Layered Exquisite Pagoda and the Art of Unlocking Heaven\u2019s Fortune. However, both martial arts and cultivation of this skill must be achieved simultaneously! If the body was not strong enough to handle it, then one would be destroyed even with the aid of a divine skill!The three hundred house guards was sceptical towards Jun Mo Xie\u2019s participation in their training. They believed that the Young Master was only doing it to show off. Seeing him stagger about right from the beginning, all of them chuckled in their hearts, convinced that he would not be able to endure for a long time. Some of them decided to start a bet, discussing about the odds and dates as they were perspiring and training.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

How could their debauchee Young Master endure this type of hellish training?Some even wagered that Jun Mo Xie would simply give up within an incense\u2019s time. However, against all expectations, Jun Mo Xie endured from the start till breakfast; his body had been staggering unsteadily right from the beginning.He\u2026 he had actually held on!\u00a0\u00a0Everyone rubbed their eyes in suspicion; they all thought that they were dreaming.Thereafter, they began to speculate whether the Young Master would participate in the afternoon training.Most of them felt that the amount of training in the morning had already passed the Young Master\u2019s capacity. It was already an amazing feat for him to endure till now!After eating breakfast, there was only half an incense\u2019s time for them to rest. However, none of them realized that Jun Mo Xie did not even consider resting.Not wanting to waste any time at all, he returned to his room as he ignored the pain coming from his aching muscles.Producing several bamboo tubes fully pierced with steel needles, he placed them methodically on the table. He then produced one bamboo tube without any steel needles on it and placed it within the formation of the preceding bamboo tubes.There was only the length of a palm\u2019s thickness between each of the bamboo tubes containing steel needles. Jun Mo Xie was aiming to hit the bamboo tube within the formation using only his fingers and without touching the tubes on either side of his palm. There was an extra requirement whereby his palms had to pass through three bamboo tubes before hitting the final tube which strike would make a sound.This little training was to train the flexibility of the fingers to its peak! This training may have looked simple, but was in fact extremely difficult!The needles were everywhere, causing any wrong amount of strength or failure in flexibility to cause the finger to be pierced by the steel needles. The resulting pain would then cause the fingers to shake even more, which in turn would lead to the fingers being pierced by more needles.Jun Mo Xie maintained an indifferent face as he calmly inserted his hands, which had just undergone the intense morning training, into the bamboo poles\u2026When afternoon training began, the house guards found Jun Mo Xie standing on the training grounds, his fingers swollen and dripping with blood, but his face seemed better.In the following afternoon training session, he continued to persevere as he staggered unsteadily onwards till the end!This result caused every one of the house guards\u2019 eyes to pop out!Nonetheless, although he had managed to complete the training, half of them still believed that it was already far beyond what the Third Young Master could endure. It was already highly commendable of him to continue his training even until now!He would not be able to continue on until late afternoon, would he?Contrary to their predictions, in the late afternoon, he remained.At this moment, all the guards were ignited as their hearts roared!How could we, as veterans of a hundred battles and hundreds of training sessions lose to a tender looking, pampered young master who had not suffered any bitterness at all?This thought caused these men who were already standing on the cliff to Hell to drop down into it. As long as Jun Mo Xie did not stop, all the house guards would grit their teeth and endure to the end! As a result\u2026 everyone ended up being too fatigued\u2026Since Jun Mo Xie was directing the training, it was only natural that Jun Wu Yi would be present as well.After inciting everybody\u2019s morale to such heights, how exactly did Jun Mo Xie intend to train them? This was something that piqued Jun Wu Yi\u2019s curiosity. However, after witnessing the contents of the training sessions, Jun Wu Yi felt a as if someone had dunked ice cold water over him!He observed the guards carry a huge and rough log run through the grounds without a single gap between each other, Jun Wu Yi\u2019s eyes opened widely. Then, after that, he spotted Jun Mo Xie amongst them, carrying the same type of log as he ran.Jun Wu Yi could not help but rub his eyes fiercely before staring again, and again he rubbed his eyes. In the end, he rubbed it so much till his eyes suffered from pain as well!If there was nothing wrong with his eyes, then the sun must have risen from the west today! How is this possible? Is this still my debauchee nephew? This is simply beyond ordinary!After night finally came, Jun Mo Xie finally ended the training. Those highly capable and sturdy house guards were all fatigued, each like a dead dog. Every single one of them laid flat on the ground, like paper blown by the wind, as they gasped for air. Not a single one was capable of standing up!As for the two company leaders, one was bent as he gasped violently for breath, the other too bent, as he kneaded his waist.Jun Mo Xie\u2019s face was pale, his body seemingly about to fall, but he remained standing upright. With an eagle-like gaze, he scanned through the chaotic crowd of soldiers as he suddenly screamed out.\u201cGet your worthless ass off the ground and stand up! In three breaths time, those who cannot stand up will be instantly eliminated! Get your worthless body out of here and commit suicide, for you do not have any rights to stand here! If you cannot even compare with this prodigal debauchee, what is the point in you even living?\u201dImmediately, everyone stood upright. They gritted their teeth as they staggered about unsteadily. A few of them were almost unable to control themselves and were about to fall over, but was held up by those around them.If they were to lose to the third Young Master, then they would really have no face to continue living.Jun Mo Xie panted as he stared at them with a cold gaze.\u201cAs of now, who among you can still claim that you are not trash? Huh? With just a single day of training, all of you have actually become such a sorry sight! Even though I am a debauchee, I am still able to stand, but you lot? All of you still are capable of lying down on the floor? Are you able to feel any shame at all? And you all still call yourselves a veteran of a hundred battles? Pui!\u201dAll three hundred guards had their faces etched with scorching shame; one by one, they all lowered their gaze to the ground.If this Young Master, who was looked down by everyone was able to persevere and still stand upright to boot, then what reason could they have to lie down?Jun Mo Xie\u2019s participation in today\u2019s training was something everyone had witnessed. All of them felt their body aching and their mind\u2019s exhausted after today\u2019s training.So how did this young master manage to endure it? Everyone knew that for this debauchee to handle today\u2019s training would require a greater mentality and effort than them due to the difference in foundation.Everyone gazed at Jun Mo Xie, their eyes filled with some degree of awe and respect! Because what Jun Mo Xie had done today was done without the slightest of foundation! On the other hand, they were a group of well-trained men\u2026Jun Mo Xie gave them all a cold gaze before turning around and walking off, leaving only one sentence.\u201cIf this were to happen again tomorrow, then all three hundred of you can get out! The Jun Family will not waste its money on trash! Especially trash that is unable to keep up with a debauchee!\u201dWatching Jun Mo Xie\u2019s back as he left, anyone could see that his legs and the muscles on his body were trembling uncontrollably. This was the surefire sign of being exhausted to their absolute limits!However, Jun Mo Xie\u2019s face did not even have a single trace of his fatigue! In terms of mental strength, everyone here was way incomparable to this young debauchee!If their debauchee Young Master was able to endure this hellish training, then could these veterans of hundred of battles say otherwise?Could they be able to speak the words \u201cdifficult\u201d when their young master had undergone the same type of training as them? What a great humiliation that would be! If they were to say those words, then the best scenario would be being looked down on with contempt by their comrades. But if they had ended up being looked down on by this debauchee Young Master, then they should seriously just take their own lives!Would they take their own lives due to shame if they were to know that Jun Mo Xie had eight weights attached to his body?None of them knew that at least a dozen spots on Jun Mo Xie\u2019s body were torn off due to the weights! Blood oozed out slowly from the wounds.The training that Jun Mo Xie underwent was estimated to be at least three times more intense than the house guards\u2019!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThat was a frightening difference! If not for the Art of Unlocking Heaven\u2019s Fortune supporting him, Jun Mo Xie with his current body would have died from over-exhaustion ten times over! However, the reason Jun Mo Xie had trained as such was to be able to use the divine powers of the Art of Unlocking Heaven\u2019s Fortune. While being pushed to his absolute limits, he would be able to break through the limitations of his body!Although Jun Wu Yi had no idea that Jun Mo Xie was practicing with weights attached to his body, Jun Mo Xie\u2019s performance today had moved this man who was once a great general who oversaw tens of thousands of soldiers!Watching Jun Mo Xie\u2019s departing silhouette, Jun Wu Yi felt greatly pleased. However, a suspicion remained within his heartCould this be his true character? If so, this is simply being too hard on yourself! What would happen if an accident were to happen if this continues?Although one must be strong to forge metal, if one was not careful, one would instead destroy the precious metal.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Little Ke nearly burst into tears when she saw Jun Mo Xie\u2019s current state. With trembling hands, she carefully took off his clothes and washed him with clean water.During the entire time, Jun Mo Xie remained standing.\u00a0Knowing how fatigued his body was, he knew that if he were to sit down, he would instantly fall unconscious! However, if he were to get through this hurdle and restored his strength while he was conscious, then he would have successfully exceeded one of the limitations of his current body!After Little Ke finished cleaning his body, he had her move away while he continued standing, meditating with focus. Through his spiritual awareness, he observed the energy channels of the Art of Unlocking Heaven\u2019s Fortune awaken sluggishly.To his surprise, he could see that the seven colored exquisite pagoda within his sea of consciousness was rotating way faster than before. Morever, it also emitted much thicker white Worldly Spiritual Qi.The Worldly Spiritual Qi slowly entered through Jun Mo Xie\u2019s meridians, flowing along the pathways. Every time the Worldly Spiritual Qi reached an area, it would give provide a cold and comfortable feeling. This feeling was akin to a person who was dying of thirst in the desert finally finding a cold drink.This feeling was simply indescribable.The misty spiritual qi continued entering Jun Mo Xie\u2019s meridians at an increased rate. Jun Mo Xie\u2019s body, which was fatigued to his limits, began to slowly recover and his entire body gradually became itchy. Especially the injured areas where the itch would be unbearable.Jun Mo Xie exerted strict self-control over the desire to scratch the itchy areas, directing his full concentration to enter a state of meditation. Slowly\u2026 he became disconnected from the outside world.Over time, all the injured areas of Jun Mo Xie\u2019s body began to discharge a clear layer of fluid, which gradually solidified, forming into scars\u2026After a while, little by little, the scars on Jun Mo Xie\u2019s body began to wrinkle up before hardening. Then, it turned into powdery crumbs as it fell apart\u2026A thin layer of dead skin cells started to accumulate around Jun Mo Xie\u2019s feet. As for the skin on his body, it started to return to its former white smoothness. The only difference was the increase in flexibility\u2026While his tensed muscles that had undergone one day\u2019s worth of exercise started to give off a crystal clear watery glow while shaking lightly. After the shaking ended, the muscles slowly loosened as it restored to its former state as if before the training was done. Next, a wave of unbearable tingling itch started before finally relaxing down\u2026Jun Mo Xie who had entered a state of meditation did not realize what was happening at all. After overcoming his fatigue, the feeling that followed was a serene feeling of relaxation. His soul felt if it had stepped into an unearthly realm.It was like a person traveling through the calm ocean, enjoying the gentle waves of the seas as it slowly washed over him and the calming and gentle feeling that accompanied it.Within his sea of consciousness, the mist that was exuded by the colorful exquisite pagoda became denser and richer. Like waves, the Pure Worldly Spiritual Qi flowed through Jun Mo Xie\u2019s body, coursing through every meridian, muscle fibre, and tendon\u2026Even though the growth of the flow of qi was not great, it was still growing non-stop. He could clearly see it slowly growing bigger after having received nourishment from the waves of the spiritual qi. In addition, his thoughts seemed to have become other-worldly, without a single trace of his previous fatigue.At this moment, his spiritual essence seemed to have merged harmoniously with the little pagoda within his sea of consciousness. Even though Jun Mo Xie was a someone with nerves of steel, this sublime feeling of comfort caused him to feel intoxicated.Abruptly, the colorful Hongjun Pagoda stopped spinning, no longer radiating as brilliantly as it just had. This event startled Jun Mo Xie awake from his other-wordly state. Even his soul was instantly brought back to the mortal realm.As for the misty white spiritual qi flowing within his meridians, it retreated back like a receding tide. Jun Mo Xie could feel that his whole body was filled to the brim with strength. Slowly, he opened his eyes, which revealed a sharp gaze filled with a divine glow!Jun Mo Xie gently flexed his body, causing the joints throughout his body release popping sounds.Instantly, his body returned to its ideal and smooth state while his state of mind was also surprisingly in an excellent mental state. As the moonlight gently shone down, Jun Mo Xie moved towards the windows. The moon hung in the sky like a plate, the surrounding clear blue skies spread out for thousands of miles.The Mid-Autumn Festival has arrived.In his original world, the Mid-Autumn Festival would be held on the 15th of August. But here, there was only the Autumn Festival which was held on the 20th of August.No matter which world he was in, the moonlight remained as gentle as water, spreading its splendor everywhere.Jun Mo Xie sighed lightly, surprised that his heart was no longer filled with the emotions of loneliness. It would seem like his heart had slowly become accustomed to the current world. The moon remained the same moon; the sky remained the same sky! Since the skies were the same skies, then he may as well just take it as a change in working environment\u2026Jun Mo Xie carefully scanned through his body and discovered that the injuries he had gotten in the day had all been healed. Even those injuries, which were severe, were all completely gone.In addition, even the scars had miraculously disappeared within the span of one night, his skin smooth yet flexible. Jun Mo Xie could not help but stare at the resultI never expected that the restorative powers of the Art of Unlocking Heaven\u2019s Fortune would be so impressive!Originally, Jun Mo Xie expected that after undergoing his training, he would have ended up with his tanned skin from his previous life. Unexpectedly, even though the quality of his body had obviously gone up at a rapid pace, his skin had only become smoother\u2026Such a disappointment! Thankfully, the transformation of his skin was towards the nature of flexibility. If his skin had instead grown softer, then he would be ashamed to go out!Jun Mo Xie continued to channel the Art into his body and was suddenly overjoyed! After his insane training and the constant exercise of the Arts in the evening, the effect obtained was extremely significant!The silky flow of qi within his body had grown at least double in size! If the original size of the flow of qi were comparable to a strand of hair, then the current size would be comparable to a strand of coarse mane on a pig\u2026Jun Mo Xie suddenly broke out in cold sweat. To say such a thing about himself, perhaps he was being overly harsh on himself\u2026In addition, the speed of the qi flow had also increased. He had understood one thing.His cultivation of the first level of Art of Unlocking Heaven\u2019s Fortune had taken a huge step forward!To his surprise, he found out that he could now use his inner eye! This was usually only possible for martial artists that had attained the Pre-Celestial stage. This Art of Unlocking Heaven\u2019s Fortune was indeed a miraculous skill. It had allowed him to access his inner eye even though he was far from reaching the Pre-Celestial stage.It seemed that there as some unexpected benefits from doing his intense training and following it up with the circulation of the Art Of unlocking Heaven\u2019s Fortune.Checking his meridians, Jun Mo Xie finally understood the mysterious aspect of the Xuan Qi within this world.The so-called Xuan Qi cultivation was not too far from internal strength cultivation, in fact, it could be considered a branch of it!The duration of Xuan Qi may not be as long as internal strength. But in exchange, it had a way higher explosive strength behind it.It was also due to the odd explosive strength that it was unable to be covertly used. And similarly, the fortitude of Xuan Qi was even less impressive. The higher a person\u2019s cultivation in Xuan Qi, it will give off an even more obvious sign that it was in use.This was the reason why each rank of Xuan Qi cultivation will have different glowing of colors!The method of cultivating Xuan Qi was almost the same as the practice of internal strength, both required the channeling of energy through the meridians. For example, there is one meridian line for the cultivation of Ninth Xuan and below cultivators. Regardless if it follows the Eight Extraordinary Vessels or the Twelve Standard Meridians, there is the single path to follow, which leads towards a channel, interconnecting through the inner cycle.When one has broken through to the Silver Xuan, the opening of a channel can occur. That way, it would be possible to increase the flow of energy. Even with the increase of energy, the cycle will still have to follow the same pathways but with a greater amount of it available.This was due to this unique body that everyone in this world had. It was no wonder that every breakthrough in Xuan Qi cultivation would be accompanied by extreme pain, comparable to the molting of a snake. It was a process whereby the cultivator would have to forcibly open up a meridian pathway. How could that not hurt?The later stages would still follow the same steps needed. Once all Twelve Standard Meridians and half of the Eight Extraordinary Vessels were opened, would then, the cultivator be considered to have stepped upon the Spirit Xuan rank. There were other criteria needed for one to be considered a true Spirit Xuan expert.Amongst the opened Eight Extraordinary Vessels, two vessels have to be interlinked. Only after having accomplished this would one be considered to have reached genuine Spirit Xuan rank!If a cultivator was able to open up four of the Eight Extraordinary Vessels but was unable interlink two of them, then that person could only be considered a fake Spirit Xuan ranked expert!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThere was one aspect, which was surprising for Jun Mo Xie.To attain the Spirit Xuan rank, one must open up all the Twelve Standard Meridians that will serve as the main flow of energy throughout the body. The dantian served as the storage for Xuan Qi.As for opening four out of the Eight Extraordinary Vessels, the most difficult part of it was the interlinking of two assigned vessels, after which one would successfully become the highest existence in this world.However, with the knowledge of martial arts, one could see that four vessels still remained closed within their bodies, but yet they would be considered reaching their highest achievement in this world.Then, above the Spirit Xuan realm, could there be an even higher existence?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Novel_Saga\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Novel_SagaCould there be an even higher existence than Spirit Xuan?With the knowledge of internal strength cultivation, the answer to this question was a resounding yes!There must be a higher existence!However, this was a different world. Even though the cultivation of both internal strength and Xuan Qi followed the same path, the results might not be similar. It was possible that the rules in this world were different and that Spirit Xuan was the limit in Xuan Qi cultivation!Jun Mo Xie was unable to come up with a conclusive answer with his current understanding of Xuan Qi.In addition, all the meridians in Jun Mo Xie\u2019s body had been completely opened after going through the Pulp Rending Meridian Cleanser.He had already achieved the realm of Hundred Interlinked Vessels of a Pre-Celestial Stage expert.\u00a0In terms of meridian quality alone, he was far superior compared to those in the Spirit Xuan realm! However, in terms of battle strength, he was not even close to being able to match one.After all, regardless of how much potential he had, he had only came to this world for a single month. Just being able to reach his current stage with the body of the original Jun Mo Xie was already considered a miracle.This was due to the wondrous powers of the Art of Unlocking Heaven\u2019s Fortune! If one were to practice any other cultivation skill, a single month was not sufficient for one to reach even the starting stages.To add to that, he had the Exquisite Hongjun Pagoda acting together with the Art of Unlocking Heaven\u2019s Fortune to open up all the meridians in Jun Mo Xie\u2019s body. This was equal to giving unlimited space of potential for Jun Mo Xie to fill them up one by one.With Jun Mo Xie\u2019s current level of strength, even an ordinary Silver Xuan expert could deal with him, especially in a fight to the death! However, it would be not so if it was an assassination. After all, assassinations were what Jun Mo Xie did for a living.Adding to that, the fully opened meridians also gave Jun Mo Xie access to a peculiar ability. While not being able to completely replicate it, as long as he had seen a Xuan Qi cultivation formula once, he would be able to imitate the forms from the formula, although the strength would obviously not be present.With this, Jun Mo Xie could not help but think.It seems that I now have another method of deception\u2026The next day, Jun Mo Xie appeared yet again on the training ground, causing everyone to be shocked! Yesterday\u2019s training was capable of giving the house guards no small amount of suffering. Even now, many areas on their body were aching to the point of death. And somehow, this Young Master was able to arrive earlier than them.After yesterday\u2019s training was over, almost every single of them found themselves looking at their Third Young Master in a different light, even their hearts were filled with respect. But, all of them were convinced that their Third Young Master would not be present tomorrow. It was not the question of having the willpower to continue but his physique being unable to cope with the stress.Unexpectedly, they would arrive to see Jun Mo Xie standing ramrod straight with a sword-like gaze present on his face. Everyone felt as though they were in a dream.Is this still the useless, death awaiting, freeloading Third Young Master?How had he manage to climb out of bed?!Jun Wu Yi had long since arrived at the training grounds. Sitting in his wheelchair, he observed everything that was happening. Although he had already expected Jun Mo Xie to appear, he was still surprised. With Jun Mo Xie\u2019s physical strength, there was no way he could have endured that kind of training, Jun Mo Xie would have been in a serious condition today.That was why Jun Wu Yi felt that it would be understandable even if Jun Mo Xie did not show up today. In Jun Wu Yi\u2019s opinion, even if Jun Mo Xie had shown up, he would be fatigued to the point of unsightliness.Yesterday\u2019s training was something that Jun Wu Yi would not be able to easily complete even with a healed body. He would never have expected that Jun Mo Xie would appear in a far superior state as compared to the guards before him.Could I have misjudged the intensity of the training?Once again, another high-intensity training started. To their shock, the guards could see that Jun Mo Xie\u2019s speed had increased instead of decreasing. Although some of his paces were lacking, it was more steady and decent compared to yesterday.The surprise did not end there. In the following training, Jun Mo Xie had begun catching up to the speed of the house guards. Eventually, he was even able to surpass some of them!This occurrence caused no small number of the house guards\u2019 eyes to turn red. Such a rapid increase in strength had never been seen before. In fact, something like this was indeed unheard of.But their Young Master was currently turning a myth into reality right before their very eyes!The Young Master\u2019s body is soft looking and tender while ours is rough and tough! If the Young Master is able to do it, why can\u2019t we?This question had once again set ablaze to the guards\u2019 hearts! Their thirst for power caused the training sessions to increase in intensity! Almost every one of their eyes were bloodshot as they gritted their teeth and trained like a wild beast with their life on the line\u2026None of them was able to realize that even while training, Jun Mo Xie had eight heavyweights strapped to his body and the fact that he had his own special training before coming to the training grounds. Moreover, Jun Mo Xie had also added in more aspects for his special training.Climbing, stone grasping, level movement, arms control, stealth\u2026Jun Mo Xie had each of the twelve long hours of a day carefully divided, not wasting even a single minute.On the third day, Jun Zhan Tian received the news about Jun Mo Xie\u2019s training and had secretly come over to observe. Although pleased with Jun Mo Xie\u2019s motivation, Jun Zhan Tian was worried that rather than improving, Jun Mo Xie would instead end up wasting his efforts. But after seeing Jun Mo Xie training that one time, Jun Zhan Tian never showed up again, he simply walked away silently and calmly. The Housekeeper, Old Pang was able to feel clear that Jun Zhan Tian was very happy and moved!Alone in the study, Jun Zhan Tian uttered a few tunes to himself. He even became drunk for the first time after a long time. After becoming intoxicated, he held a wide grin on his face.After that, he walked off, staggering unsteadily towards the room with the memorial tablet of his deceased wife. There, he mumbled for the whole night.On the second day, he came out with a grin, several tears could still be seen remaining in the corner of his eyes\u2026On the day before the Autumn Festival, Tianxiang City had already begun to liven up. Everyone was dressed up, and every corner was decorated in abundant colors. For those who had left home had started returning to celebrate the Autumn Festival. How could the place not be lively?In mid-afternoon, within the highest floor of the Drunken Immortal Establishment.A group of bodyguards was seated together at two tables. There was another table between the two tables, where only two people were seated. These two were naturally Jun Mo Xie and Tang Yuan.Tang Yuan who was seated opposite Jun Mo Xie constantly sighed, his brows knitted up into a scowl. For the past few days, he had suffered greatly. Tang Wan Li had almost torn away all of the fats from his grandson.Firstly, he was grounded, no longer able to take even one-step out of the residence. After which, whenever Tang Wan Li recalled the incident of the Xuan Core being stolen, he would have someone summon Tang Yuan over. Which would lead to a round of cursing and jumping around in anger?Next, he would slap Tang Yuan a few times to vent his anger before telling him to scram. This situation would occur more than three times a day. Simply put, whenever Tang Wan Li recalled the incident would be whenever Tang Yuan had to go over.Tang Yuan had originally lost a great deal of face. He nearly lost his fianc\u00e9e, causing his future father-in-law to give a good scolding. His fianc\u00e9e was in tears. She insisted on breaking off their engagement by threatening to kill herself.There was no helping it if such a thing could have nearly occurred today, who could say that it would not have happened the next day. If that was to happen, what then could she do\u2026Whenever his father saw him, the first thing he would do was slap him in the face. After that, he would go look for a stick to beat him with. His mother although wanting to restrain his father, was too fearful. His knitted forehead has had no chance to become smooth at all. Whenever his little brothers met him, they would ask him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cBig brother, when will you go to the Thousand Gold Hall again? Please allow us to bask in your glory as well\u2026\u201dAfter saying that, they would burst out into laughter\u2026However, the most painful matter was that each time Tang Wan Li scolded him; he would be forced to kneel down on an abacus. For this matter, a special iron abacus was made.Why?There was no need to ask. Considering how heavy Fatty Tang was, a normal abacuses would have long broken down every time he kneeled on them.

This was even after suffering countless sessions of scoldings and beatings and even when he was a subject of gossip which was enough to cause an average man to commit suicide in shame.For him, he only needed to take a nap and he would be able to dismiss everything that had happened and consider them history.If this was any other person, there would already have been a rope around his neck and he would have undergone the cycle of samsara countless times.Although, this so-called optimistic attitude to life, a big heart or having nerves of steel was but a better way of saying it. A harsher way of looking at it, was him being a thick-skinned, shameless person.Finally, this fatty was able to use the coming Autumn Festival as an excuse to slip away from his house. The first thing he did after escaping was to come complain to Jun Mo Xie. Coincidentally, Jun Mo Xie was busy pondering what it was that he had obtained. For Fatty Tang to come, heading to the Drunken Immortal Establishment for some drinks.Fatty Tang drank a cup of wine, then gave out three sighs. Then, he stretched out his radish-like index finger to the skies and let out a mouthful of curses as he vented his anger.Drinking one cup after another, he repeated\u2026 again and again\u2026With such violent intensity, such vicious deep-seated hatred. One would think he was an old lady who had just lost her husband.All the guests on the upper floor frowned! Even his bodyguards looked away, acting as though they were strangers.To have to accompany this kind of Young Master out, was simply too humiliating\u2026Jun Mo Xie himself rolled his eyes. Even though he possessed a calm temperament, the one that the fatty was cursing included himself; and yet, he had to sit still and ignore whatever was said about him. How could he not have a single reaction?\u201cI say, Fatty, what exactly was stolen from your home? With your relentless cursing, my mood to continue drinking has been extinguished.\u201dJun Mo Xie looked at the cup of wine before him. Being cursed at was but a small thing, after all with his calm temperament, something like that could be take in stride easily.The wine, on the other hand, was made so that its fragrance would assail one\u2019s nose, but the taste was akin to drinking rice water, not having the slightest hope of making one tipsy! It was harder to stomach than the curses!The evaluation of the wine that Jun Mo Xie would give was this.This wine was just like a woman whose body is even fatter than Tang Yuan, whom then, used a bunch of cheap perfume to mask away her body shape.Having drunk this wine, Jun Mo Xie could not help but recall Old Song\u2019s wine from the night with the heavy rain. Jun Mo Xie now felt a longing for the wine that he had once contemptuously considered as trash.This was how the phrase,\u201cThe dead should be compared with other dead people while the living should be compared with other living people.\u201dThe wine was something hard for Jun Mo Xie to swallow and was severely lacking compared to the top-grade wines of his previous life. But now, he had finally understood. The man\u2019s words back then were indeed, the truth!Jun Mo Xie suddenly recalled that he had recently brewed some wine! After having placed them aside for the fermentation to take place, he had totally forgotten about them. Counting down the days, he came to a conclusion.I should be able to take them out in a few days\u2019 time. I should quickly have them be completed soon. Even if it is not for the sake of making money, I should do it for my own sake!If I have to keep drinking this kind of rubbish wine, how am I supposed to live?Once I take the wine out from fermentation, I too will sell in limited numbers!Son of a bitch! Ten thousand silver Liangs per jug!Either you love it and pay for it or leave it!I will drink it all myself! If I cannot finish it then I will let pigs drink it!Son of a bitch! Just saying it, makes me feel comfortable!He thought viciously to himself while smelling the cup of \u2018garbage\u2019 wine. With his heretical thoughts, feeding it to the pigs was not something he would not do\u2026\u201cSigh\u2026\u201d Tang Yuan paused, his round face, comparable to a poached egg was etched with a distorted expression.\u201cThird Young Master\u2026 Brother, I am really having a fucking miserable time. Why did they have to bring this calamity onto me? Could they have not have bought it to another family? Damn their eighteen generations! This senior will be sure to exterminate them forever! And then there were those damn thieves! They were the ones who stole the items, yet why is my grandfather constantly targeting me instead? I pray that they become crippled for the rest of their lives!\u201dThe more he said, the more agitated he became. Tang Yuan stood up in rage, slamming his leg down, forcing his entire body weight upon the chair he was seated upon. The slabs of fat on his body moved aggressively as he roared savagely towards the skies!Thankfully, the chairs in the Drunken Immortal Establishment were adequate enough to support the weight of this fatty, if not the chair would have broken a few times by now!Jun Mo Xie felt his self-control slipping. He raised his hands to cover his face, feeling a strong urge to run away\u2026 it was far too humiliating to be seen with this fatty\u2026The entire third floor of the Drunken Immortal Establishment suddenly became deathly silent! Everyone turned their heads to observe this fatty raging in anger.Panting, Tang Yuan removed his leg from the chair, sat back down without even wiping it, and started to drink violently again.\u201cThird Young Master, the item that my family lost this time is something unordinary!\u201d Tang Yuan twisted his face with anger.\u201cDue to this item, my life has become a living hell for these past few days. My old man had given me close to a dozen beatings while my grandfather will beat me with a huge stick as he chases me. Look at me\u2026 how fast do you think I can run? Look at how much weight I have lost,\u201dTang Yuan plaintively measured his body as he sat on the chair; the fats from his soft belly covering his knees.\u201cErr\u2026 you have indeed lost a lot of weight,\u201d Jun Mo Xie spoke contrary to his real thoughts before adding on. \u201cYou have lost so much weight that your face does not have any wrinkles anymore.\u201dTang Yuan let out a \u201cpui\u201d. He had originally wanted to trigger Jun Mo Xie\u2019s curiosity but Jun Mo Xie did not even attempt to ask about it. Nevertheless, this matter had caused much misery onto Tang Yuan. If he did not have any desire to vent, why would he have brought Jun Mo Xie here?\u201cThird Young Master, that item is a Xuan Core, a true Xuan Core!\u201d Tang Yuan moved close to Jun Mo Xie and whispered into his ear. Not just any Xuan Core, it is one of a peak Ninth level Xuan Beast! That is simply a treasure used to defy the heavens!\u201d\u201cSo? It is just a Xuan Core. And here I thought it was something incredible.\u201dA Xuan Core from a peak Ninth Xuan Beast?Jun Mo Xie\u2019s heart jumped, but he hid his thoughts away and acted dismissively.\u201cWhat is so extraordinary about something like that? I too have one.\u201d\u201cYou think this is the same as those Fifth and Sixth level trash? You dare take your little toy and compare it with my family\u2019s?\u201dTang Yuan snorted loudly.\u201cLet me enlighten you, that thing in my home was a pinnacle Ninth level Xuan Core. If this were to be leaked out, I fear that the whole world would quake due to it! If an Earth Xuan ranked expert were to utilize it, that person would be able to be propelled from the beginner stage of Earth Xuan up to the peak stage of Sky Xuan! If it was a middle stage Sky Xuan ranked expert, then that person would be able to charge all the way into the realm of Spirit Xuan! Third Young Master! A Spirit Xuan rank expert! The numbers of such an expert can be only be counted on one hand!\u201dTang Yuan moved his short, fat hands in an exaggerated embracing posture, signifying the world.\u201cIt has such a potent effect?\u201dJun Mo Xie\u2019s heart was pounding, but he looked at Tang Yuan with suspicion.\u201cYou dare to boast so much in front of me? If it truly has such a potent effect, then wouldn\u2019t the Chamber of Commerce sell it like crazy?Tang Yuan felt insulted. Raising his fingers, he made an oath, his fat face becoming red.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWhichever son of a bitch is bragging will have his entire family die!\u201d\u201cSell it like crazy? Did you think you can just find something like this anywhere? If this was not an extremely rare item, do you think my grandfather would have been so mad? I am a real son of a bitch! To think I would complain about this to you, this son of a bitch! I have really found the wrong son of a bitch to complain to!\u201d Fatty Tang became agitated and began uttering his catchphrase 'son of a bitch\u201d with wanton abandon.\u201cOh\u2026 I truly feel sympathy for your mother,\u201d Jun Mo Xie gave out a long \u201coh\u201d. In his mind, he was considering what to do. If this was truly such a Heavenly defying treasure, then the more it should not be returned to the Tang Family. Rather then have it be wasted on the Tang family, such a treasure would be of much more use on his own family, being able to create a super expert.Tang Yuan, whose eyes were currently both red, grinned. He felt that in these past few days, it was indeed only Jun Mo Xie, who was willing to hear him out. This caused him to feel moved, suddenly causing some mucus to rise. He easily blew it out before turning back to face Jun Mo Xie and continue his heartfelt conversation. It was at this moment\u2026\u201cWho was it? Which bitch was carelessly blowing off his snot? Get your bitch ass out here! Watch as this senior annihilate your nine generations!\u201d A sharp, angry voice rang out loudly, accompanying an unparalleled aura of violence and wickedness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Who the fuck was the one blowing off his snot? Fuck, get your ass out here! Watch as this senior annihilate your nine generations!\u201d A sharp, angry voice sounded with unparalleled anger.Jun Mo Xie turned and saw a young man wearing green silk gown at the stairs with an alluring woman within his left arm.\u00a0This man had an expression of rage as he furiosuly tried to rub away the yellow lump on his right cheek that was none other than Tang Yuan\u2019s snot.Tang Yuan was seated with his back facing the stairs when he blew his nose off to the ground. It was extremely inprobably for his snot to hit someone, much less landed on a person\u2019s face. However, due to some coincidence, Tang Yuan had blown his nose the very moment the youngster and the woman were ascending the stairs.During that time, the young man was busily kneading the woman\u2019s bosom, their heads just appearing from the stairs. It was then that the mass of snot flew over. If not for the fact that they had their faces turned to the side, it might have directly entered his mouth\u2026Jun Mo Xie\u2019s eyes were bulging and his tongue was tied. After some time, he laughed and clasped his fists in respect, \u201cFatty Yuan, there\u2019s no match to your accuracy. Respect ah\u2026 respect\u2026\u201dTang Yuan was also dumbfounded. He laughed ruefully, \u201cIt\u2019s not my accuracy which is amazing. It\u2019s this fella\u2019s luck which is truly too heaven-defying\u2026\u201dThis statement from Tang Yuan was certainly on point. Tang Yuan and Jun Mo Xie knew almost all of the notorious Young Masters within Tianxiang City. This young man had an overbearing attitude with a face full of arrogance, indicating that he was no ordinary person, yet, neither Tang Yuan nor Jun Mo Xie could recognize him. This could only mean that this man was a nobody amongst the local debauchees.Not only did this nobody get his face hit by snot, he had currently provoked Jun Mo Xie and Tang Yuan, the two most notorious debauchees in the capital. As such, his luck can truly be considered Heaven defying.As the two of them were speaking, the young man suddenly turned his attention towards them. Releasing the woman from his left hand, he marched over aggressively and roared at Tang Yuan with a twisted expression. \u201cYou damned son of a bitch fatty, are you looking for death? And you, flower boy! What are you laughing at, you son of a bitch?\u201dJun Mo Xie\u2019s face suddenly became dark and sinister. He had originally thought of advising Tang Yuan not to beat him to death. After all, the one at fault was still Tang Yuan. But after listening to those words, he slowly sat down. This person simply deserved to die!Tang Yuan was not a virtuous gentleman. And he happened to be in the most depressed state of his life and was in dire need of a punching bag in relieving his stress. Once he heard those words, he exploded. His fat spherical body blasted off like a volleyball that was kicked at full power as he slapped the youngster in the face. A palm as big as a bear\u2019s fell upon the youngster\u2019s cheek.The youngster had never expected that Tang Yuan, who was indeed in the wrong, would actually attack him without uttering a single word. This type of bully was indeed uncommon in this world!His body was weak and simply unable to avoid the strike. All he could do was take it straight on, his body spinning twice before falling on his ass onto the ground. Before him, stars started flashing and his brain felt like it bounced around in his skull. Then, his mouth wide open as he spat out blood and four white teeth.With a savage face, Tang Yuan rushed forward, his close to two hundred and fifty kilos body slammed down upon the poor bastard, landing one punch after another on the man\u2019s face. He cursed.\u201cScrew your granny! Do you dare to play the victim when I am in a bad mood? Me blowing my snot onto your face is a way of showing you respect, but you still dare to curse me? If I don\u2019t beat you to death today, then I will be letting your mother down, you stupid bastard!\u201dEach word was accompanied by a punch, each punch following a certain rhythm. The resulting sounds were similar to that of a pig howling in the midst of being slaughtered.A cracking sound could be heard as the poor bastard\u2019s leg was abruptly broken from the sheer weight of Tang Yuan\u2019s body\u2026 The youngster cried out miserably one more time, his body convulsing, his head slacks as he fainted.It was at this moment that the woman who came together with the youngster recovered from the shock. A shrill high-pitched scream broke out, instantly rising in intensity.\u201cStop screaming!\u201d Tang Yuan shouted ferociously, his eyes staring at her viciously. The woman stopped in shock.She covered her mouth fearfully before running down the stairs. A huge bang could be heard followed by a wretched cry and a tumbling sound. Apparently, the woman had lost her balance while running down the stairs and ended up tumbling down.\u201cThat is enough! Since you have already vented your anger, just leave him be. If you continue beating him, he will really die!\u201d Jun Mo Xie frowned, as he began to feel exhausted from today\u2019s outing.\u201cSo what if I really end up killing him? What would happen to this senior if he dies?\u201d Tang Yuan gave the man two more brutal punches before standing up, panting as he did so. It was not that easy for Tang Yuan to punch people. After all, it was something that required effort. Tang Yuan was obviously quite tired as his eyes squinted. \u201cIn this whole capital, the number of people I, Tang Yuan, are unable to kill can only be counted on one hand!\u201d\u201cThis bastard seems to have some background,\u201d Jun Mo Xie indicated towards the outside with his chin. Urgent footsteps could be heard as no small amount of people rushed towards them.Tang Yuan dismissed it with curled lips. \u201cHe but someone that we both can\u2019t even recognize, what worthless background would he even have? Just a waste of space! Even if his ancestor were to come, this Young Master will just use a single finger to send them back to heaven!\u201d\u201cThe\u2026 the two wicked people are upstairs. Qin\u2026 Young Master Qin is also up there.\u201d The panicked voice of the woman was heard from below. Following that, the sounds of swords being drawn out from their sheaths were heard as the sound of footsteps from the stairs was heard.In an instant, six warriors with cold looks on their faces came to stand before the two of them. Noticing the young man covered with blood sprawled on the floor, their faces became rageful. One of them had similar looks to the injured young man, his face squarish, sporting a beard, he roared angrily as his eyes seemingly shot out waves of fire. \u201cWhat the hell are you just standing there for? Quickly help the Young Master up and deal with these two insolent beasts!\u201dFour of the warriors acknowledged the order. They stepped forward, ready to act.Beside them stood several men wearing officer uniforms. They laughed as they asked. \u201cClan Leader Qin, do you want to let us handle this matter? We will certainly\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat nonsense! My son has already been beaten to such a sorry state, and still want me to let you all handle it? Today, this two bastards will be settled by me, not a single hair on their body will be let off the hook! I am curious to know, which bastard dares to touch my, Qin Hu\u2019s son! Especially in this Drunken Immortal Establishment located in the northern area of the city!\u201dThe two officers originally wanted to ingratiate themselves up to him but instead ending up provoking him. They felt embarrassed and became silent.The person who was furiously clamouring on about revenge was the Clan Leader of the Northern City Clan, one of the Six Great Clans within Tianxiang City.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAs for the youngster lying on the ground, he was none other than the only son of Qin Hu, Qin Xiao Bao, a debauchee with quite the considerable background.\u201cYour son is \u201cuntouchable\u201d?\u201d Jun Mo Xie stared at him with cold eyes as he watched Qin Hu express himself in such a domineering way. \u201cThen what would happen if your son tries to do something to us? Are you saying that us, the common man, can only be bullied by your son?\u201dQin Xiao Bao could certainly be considered as a debauchee with a considerable background. But it must be compared to the right people. And today there would be a calamity for him, for the two-person he had bumped into just happened to be the two debauchees with the biggest backing in the capital.In addition, one of them happened to be in dire need of venting his wrath. Qin Xiao Bao\u2019s current situation was tantamount to a little rabbit showing off before a tiger and a wolf. This was truly a case of man trying to push Heaven\u2019s will.\u201cHahaha\u2026 who dares touch my, Qin Hu\u2019s son? Whoever dares, I will destroy his entire clan!\u201d When he heard Jun Mo Xie claiming to be \u201ccommon man\u201d, Qin Hu\u2019s heart became set as he viciously stared at him. \u201cLittle flower boy, it appears that you are wanting to die for you to beat my son to such a state.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Just as he was about to jump up and shout out his name, Jun Mo Xie restrained him with a hand. If both of them were the one to step forward, their reputation would suffer.Originally, Tang Yuan was the one in the wrong. If Qin Xiao Bao had not cursed in such a vicious manner, then this whole matter would have been over with just a few words. However, after listening to Qin Hu\u2019s words, Jun Mo Xie\u2019s killing intent was lit.Jun Mo Xie\u2019s manner of conduct has never been about morals. He would act on his own whim, deciding if someone was an ally or enemy in a heartbeat. After hearing Qin Hu\u2019s words, Jun Mo Xie had resolved to not show any mercy to the Northern City Clan!Like father, like son. Who knows how many people would suffer under these men. Considering how both father and son were bastards, Jun Mo Xie believed that killing them would be an act of helping Heaven dispense justice, one that would earn great karma!The leader of the Tang Family\u2019s bodyguards stood up. The other three men behind him followed suit, as their bodies all exuded a silver radiance. The four Silver Xuan experts stepped forward in tandem, their gaze sword-like. \u201cA mere Qin Hu?\u201dQin Hu was momentarily shocked as he felt a powerful pressure converging on him. His mind thinking and his body channeling Xuan Qi, causing his body to glow with a golden radiance. He then retracted his arrogant demeanor and cautiously replied. \u201cI am Qin Hu, the Clan Leader of the Northern City Clan. May I ask whom might you be?\u201dA Gold Xuan expert!As the master of a clan, this Qin Hu was indeed not an ordinary person!However, this Gold Xuan expert\u2019s heart was currently thumping rapidly. Having witnessed the strength of the opposing side, the Clan Leader of the Northern City Clan immediately changed his attitude!Naturally, he would not view those Silver Xuan experts highly. But the problem was that the two bastards were capable of having four Silver Xuan experts as bodyguards! What could this mean? What kind of backing do these two have? Could it be that his son had once again provoked someone he should not?A Gold Xuan expert was indeed qualified to become a Clan Leader. Within the city, Qin Hu was considered to be quite the influential individual. However, the number of people that Qin Hu could not afford to provoke remained considerable!Qin Hu recalled that not too long ago, his son had provoked a very handsome Young Master by molesting a beautiful maid of that Young Master. Back then, the Young Master did not retaliate in any way.However, after night fell, all the senior members of the Northern City Clan were captured. They were then transported to a hidden place. As for Qin Hu, his Xuan Qi cultivation which was once at the peak of Gold Xuan ended up falling down one stage to the middle stages of Gold Xuan after being constantly beaten by them. His son, Qin Xiao Bao, on the other hand, had his dantian broken and could no longer cultivate Xuan Qi!After three days and three nights, they were finally released. But the price of freedom was becoming nothing but the pawns of that Young Master. Even after that, he still could not find out the identity of that young master but he could guess that he was most likely from one of the clans with sky-high authority!In the face of the influential nobles of the royal court, not even the average Earth Xuan expert could afford to provoke them, much less a mere Gold Xuan Qi expert!Currently, the one standing before him had a posture, which excluded a strength far beyond that mysterious Young Master. In addition, the flower boy seemed even more handsome compared to the mysterious Young Master. Could it have been that both of these brats were of the same type of existence as the mysterious Young Master?\u201cClan Leader of the Northern City Clan, Qin Hu? Never heard of it. Where has garbage like you surfaced from? To think that you would dare be act so presumptuous, as to who am I? You are not even qualified to know, but today your son has actually dared to offend our Young Master Tang, a unforgivable sin. But our Young Master is a generous man. After merely giving your son a light punishment, he decided to let your son off! As a father, not only should you have felt grateful, you should have taken this opportunity to discipline your son! Instead, you brought your men to pin the blame on others. In addition, you are colluding with some officials to capture these two Young Masters, it seems like you have grown some balls!\u201d The leader of the bodyguards said slowly, staring straight at Qin HuWhat great proclamation! Jun Mo Xie secretly applauded. With just a few sentences, this bodyguard leader had thrown all the crimes onto Qin Xiao Bao, giving no room for Qin Hu to refute. But not only that, he was able to change Fatty Tang\u2019s reputation into someone with great class. Just by considering his skill in bullshitting, this man was certainly a talent, an absolutely great talent!\u201cThe Eldest Young Master of the Tang Family?\u201d Hearing those words, Qin Hu nearly fainted right there. The one family he feared most at the current was none other than the Tang Family. The reason was simple, a guilty conscience!Even though the mysterious Young Master was terrifying, ignorance is bliss. Qin Hu had naturally feared the mysterious Young Master, but neither the identity nor true strength of his background was known. But the Tang Family was a whole other matter! The Tang Family was a renowned name in the whole city. It would be akin to child\u2019s play for the Tang Family to destroy his tiny, little Northern City Clan.Not even mentioning, the fact that he had previously followed the instructions of the mysterious Young Master to steal the Xuan Core from the Tang Family. As of now, the situation remained dire.Every single day, he had dreaded that the Tang Family would suddenly appear before his doorstep, bringing the destruction of his Northern City Clan with it.Who could have guessed that his own son would end up provoking the Eldest Young Master of the Tang Family at this critical moment! With such an impressive self-destroying move, how was he supposed to live through this?At this moment, Qin Hu felt that he was about to faint! When faced with such dangerous people, one would not want but hide quickly. But his son instead willingly went ahead to offend them!Even if you want to commit suicide, do you have to commit suicide in such a manner? Normal people would turn back after hitting into a brick wall, but why did his own son not only turn away but continued hitting the wall?Looking at his son who was sprawled on the floor, blood splattered all over his body after being \u2018lightly punished\u2019 by the Eldest Young Master Tang, Qin Hu felt anger, worry, and heartache. His Northern City Clan may not be a lightweight powerhouse, but when compared to the highly influential Tang Family, it was no different from an ant compared to a tiger.This only son of his was simply too spoilt. Back then, he had already lost his Datian back then and his chance of cultivation, which was equal to half of his life. And yet, he did not keep that lesson in mind. It seemed that his life would be forfeit this time around.However, the ones who were feeling dreadful were not only Qin Hu, but also those four officers. They had originally intended to help Master Qin relieve his anger and in the process earn a small fortune. How could they have guessed that the person would be Young Master Tang? This was no longer a monetary problem, but a life and death situation!\u201cAs for you trash of the government, stay still and wait for your superiors to come. I want to question them, is this how the men from the Ministry of Justice conduct themselves? Complying with the wishes of underground gangs and oppressing the weak, common man, becoming dogs for men? Naught but a servant of injustice!\u201dTang Yuan gave the few officers a deep and sinister stare, each and every one of his words was just and righteous! However, these words should not have come out from Tang Yuan\u2019s mouth. It should have been directed at Tang Yuan instead!Jun Mo Xie who was listening by the side felt tempted to burst out into laughter. Fatty Tang sure had guts, to call himself a weak, common man!The four officers\u2019 face became deathly pale as they turned to look at one another, their bodies swaying weakly as though it was about to fall. If Tang Yuan had shouted slightly louder, then these men would have been scared to death!Who was Tang Yuan\u2019s father-in-law to be? It was, Sun Chenghe, the Vice-Minister of the Ministry of Justice, the very one in charge of all of them. Their superior was a subordinate of Sun Chenghe. If their superior came and saw that they had colluded with the Northern City Clan to deal with the son-in-law of the one above them, how much trouble would that cause? When that happened, these four bastards would suffer a fate worse than death.These four officers were truly unfortunate. They had naturally heard of the Eldest Young Master Tang, but they were truly too low in the system and as such, have never seen him before As an exalted individual, Tang Yuan was someone whom they have only heard of. Today, however, was the day they found themselves slammed with his identity!\u201cIt turns out that this person is the Eldest Young Master Tang. Please accept my sincerest apology,\u201dQin Hu\u2019s facial expression immediately changed into one with a flattering smile. He clasped his hands together courteously as he saluted.\u201cThis lowly one has eyes but failed to see Mount Tai. I have deeply offended Young Master Tang. I had even troubled Young Master Tang to help in disciplining my son. This lowly one is deeply grateful and hopes that the immeasurably generous senior Young Master Tang would show some leniency.\u201dTang Yuan held his nose up high and snorted, ignoring Qin Hu. He turned to face the four bodyguards and said.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThis brat was being rough with me for no reason, there must a story behind it! I now suspect that there is a relation between the Northern City Clan and the robbery case of my Tang Residence. Bring this brat together and interrogate him properly.\u201dThe four bodyguards immediately acknowledged the order, but present on their face was a pained expression. They had the same thoughts together.This matter was originally your fault, to begin with. Your snot had landed on someone else\u2019s face, and then you beat that person to the point of death. Now his father had already apologized to you in such a humble manner, but instead, you decide to accuse others of being a thief. This is far too much.These words were simply the result of Tang Yuan\u2019s vexed emotions, a way for him to vent his anger. He simply accused Qin Xiao Bao of whatever he could think of after all Qin Xiao Bao had offended him during the worst time possible. How would Tang Yuan just let him off go just like that?But how could Tang Yuan have known that this nonsensical accusation of his was just like a cat running into a dead mouse! Without any form of cunning or skill, he had actually caught the thief!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This situation was just akin to bumping into a ghost in the middle of the night. It is obvious that Tang Yuan is randomly throwing out an accusation but somehow it had hit the bullseye. What an extremely messed up son of a bitch! If my son somehow lets out anything he should not\u2026There were way too many intelligent and capable people in the Tang Family!Jun Mo Xie was grinning sinisterly as he sat on the side. Jun Mo Xie saw Qin Hu\u2019s face turning pale, his eyes roaming evasively, Jun Mo Xie felt surprised.Those words from Fatty Tang were spoken just to increase his own reputation and benefits. Why was Qin Hu panicking so much over just a few words? It didn\u2019t make any sense. Even though the Northern City Clan was presently the weakest amongst the Six Great Clans, Qin Hu was still a Clan Leader. Surely he had no need to be so fearful. In fact, depending on how Qin Hu dealt with this situation, he could actually use this opportunity to form relations with the Tang Family, turning this situation into one with great benefits. And yet, his current expression was one filled with guilt\u2026 why so?Wait! Guilt?!Thinking about that, Jun Mo Xie\u2019s gaze towards Qin Hu changed, having a greater understanding, his thoughts clicking into place.\u201cThis lowly one\u2019s son was being rude; it is only fitting that he be disciplined. But, may I request the permission to first bring him back to treat his wounds before sending him to Eldest Young Master\u2019s residence for disciplinary action? Naturally, since this lowly one\u2019s son had caused Eldest Young Master a fright, I will definitely compensate you to your satisfaction!\u201dEven though he had been rendered fearful after what happened last time, as a Clan Leader with years of experience, Qin Hu was able to immediately recover. He proposed a compromising stance with a smile on his face.Tang Yuan gave out a \u2018hm\u2019 and said.\u201cI would like to see just how you Northern City Clan can manage to compensate me!\u201dThis sentence of his signified that he no longer wished to pursue this matter as now that Fatty Tang has managed to keep his reputation intact, all he wanted was to gain benefits! As an experienced man, Qin Hu naturally understood Tang Yuan\u2019s intentions and replied in a grateful voice.\u201cI thank the great Eldest Young Master for your mercy! I will certainly visit to thank Eldest Young Master for your great kindness!\u201dTang Yuan gave a light sound of agreement and turned towards Jun Mo Xie.\u201cAlthough I no longer have a problem with you, your son had earlier cursed Third Young Master Jun here. Now it is up to Third Young Master Jun to decide your son\u2019s punishment, if he is willing to let it go, then you are free to go.\u201d\u201cThird Young Master Jun?!\u201dQin Hu immediately understood who the person was. In the entire city, the infamous Jun Mo Xie was the only one whom Tang Yuan would address as \u201cThird Young Master Jun\u201d!Not only did his son offend the Eldest Young Master Tang, he also cursed the even more terrifying Third Young Master Jun! At this moment, Qin Hu was almost overwhelmed with an impulse to strangle his own son.If QIn Xiao Bao was not his only son, he would have long been strangled to death.Jun Mo Xie looked at Qin Hu, a flash appeared in his eyes before fading away, quickly deciding on what to do. Qin Hu and his son Qin Xiao Bao were both rude, overbearing and arrogant in protecting their own self-interest.Jun Mo Xie could only imagine how many sins these two have committed! Today, if Qin Xiao Bao had not met Jun Mo Xie and Tang Yuan and had instead met an ordinary person, would that person still be alive?Facing scums of society, such as Qin Hu and Qin Xiao Bao, letting them live would cause Jun Mo Xie extreme discomfort!The survival of the Northern City Clan would also bring about discomfort!Jun Mo Xie\u2019s killing intent had been ignited! However, he also had some scruples, mainly because of his sensitive feeling that in this restaurant, it seems that some people are spying on himself and observing his every move.He leaned back lazily in the chair and lifted both his legs by habit. He pointed at Qin Hu\u2019s head with his finger.\u201cQin Hu, after hearing your words earlier, I had originally decided to teach you a lesson! But after seeing that you still have some respect left, I have decided to forget about it. But, I heard that your Northern City Clan had opened no small amount of casinos. I also hear that your clan has been rolling in mountains of gold and silver every day. Haha\u2026 you have been flourishing lately huh.\u201dWith a single stare and two cold sneers, Jun Mo Xie continued.\u201cQin Hu, this Young Master will wait to see how you settle your affairs. If you dare make me dissatisfied, this Young Master can assure you that no one in your Northern City Clan would live to see the sun tomorrow!\u201d Having said that, Jun Mo Xie bent his body. He approached Qin Hu\u2019s ears and gave a strange smile. \u201cHowever, if you can properly satisfy me, then it may be possible for you to enjoy certain benefits as well\u2026 Hahaha\u201dYou might as well just tell us to cough out as much money as we can! Is it that interesting to beat around the bush in such a manner?Qin Hu cursed in his heart but was unable to do anything as the opposing side\u2019s influence was stronger than his. As a Clan Leader, he had to endure being abused by a young teenager. It was extremely shameful! However, Qin Hu dared not show the slightest hint of displeasure. Something like exterminating the Northern City Clan would be cakewalk for Jun Mo Xie\u2026Accompanied by a smile on his face, Qin Hu swore to make Jun Mo Xie satisfied, and finally being waved away by Jun Mo Xie, picked up his son and walked away.\u201cPui! What a mood breaker!\u201dTang Yuan fiercely spat out as he watched Qin Hu\u2019s leaving back.\u201cThird Young Master, the Gifted Scholar\u2019s Feast will be held tomorrow evening in the central Island of Moondrop Lake. Are you going? I heard that there will be a lot of new stuff!\u201dTraditionally, Tianxiang Kingdom will hold the Gifted Scholar\u2019s Feast during the annual Autumn Festival and an evening in the center Island of Moondrop Lake. The Emperor would take this opportunity to have his ministers gather ten gifted scholars from the Wenxing Institute of Knowledge.These ten individuals were in fact, the few handsome talents that were about to graduate and serve the royal court. Using this feast, they would be able to accurately judge each and every one of their talent, before giving the right position for each of them. As such, this Gifted Scholar\u2019s Autumn Festival Feast was a place for them to directly step onto the right platform.A mere ten places were certainly not enough for the thousands of scholars. This situation would cause an intense competition to arise among the scholars of Wenxing Institute of Knowledge. This situation would also become the main focus of the masses. Even the great families would assign some men to attempt to approach these men into serving their family.In addition, these gifted scholars were mostly bachelors with a very promising future. Thus, some young ladies from various noble families would desire to select their future husbands from amongst them. Naturally, many others would choose to join in as well.With so many ladies from the noble families there, it was only natural for the debauchees like Tang Yuan and Jun Mo Xie to appear. In order to garner the attention of the beauties, they would end up competing with the gifted scholars in a battle of wit.However, each of these competitions would end with the debauchee side losing miserably. Such was the case each year. However currently, Tang Yuan still had a look of excitement present on his whole body, he obviously felt that this was an important matter. It could not even be said that if they could aspire to win, but rather that it wasn\u2019t that optimistic.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cGifted Scholar\u2019s Feast? Eldest Young Master Tang, just look at the two of us. Do we look like\u2026 gifted scholars?\u201d Jun Mo Xie rolled his eyes. \u201cIt would be more accurate to call us rapeseeds.\u201dIn his heart, Jun Mo Xie had to restrain himself from saying.With my delicate features, it may not be too farfetched to be labeled a gifted scholar. But you my dear brother, even calling you a rapeseed is inappropriate. For you, it would be more fitting to call you a fat seed!\u201cNonsense! What gifted scholars? They are just a bunch of pedantic men bent on making a profit. Do you remember that Zhao Cheng Song who caused me to lose face in front of Miss Li in last year\u2019s Gifted Scholar\u2019s Autumn Festival Feast?He was that one person who kept throwing various insults around. I immediately arranged for him to be employed by our Tang Family. All I needed to do was promise him a high position and big salary for him to run over. Do you know which department he is in now?\u201d Tang Yuan said in a triumphant manner.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Recalling his memories, he remembered that this Zhao Cheng Song\u2019s family circumstances were only average at best. He indeed did possess a talent for learning but he was power hungry. Externally, he gave off the bearing of an aloof gentleman, but internally, was in fact just compliant trash.Back then, both Tang Yuan and him competed against one another to win the favor of the young lady from the Grand Preceptor Li\u2019s Family. But, at the end of the day, none of the noble ladies took a fancy to him. So how could it be that Tang Yuan would suddenly turn so generous as to take this sort of person in? It was simply not the way Tang Yuan did things!\u201cI first had him placed into the Ministry of State Revenue, then had my uncle find faults with him and had him transferred. After he had transferred several times, his current duty is to rub my back every time I take a bath and wash my laundry every day. The clothes of my lesser concubines are also his responsibility! Besides that, he has no other duties!\u201dTang Yuan laughed viciously.\u201cIf he had remained stubborn and quiet until the end, then I would have let it go and stopped tormenting him. But this spineless guy actually tried to act all high and mighty in front of me saying things like \u2018scholar with distinguished and admirable reputation\u2019. Pui! That son of a bitch! Since he wanted to tear out the skirts in the Grand Preceptor Li\u2019s Residence, I will just let him wash skirts every day!\u201dTang Yuan\u2019s uncle was the Outer Minister for the Ministry of State Revenue. Something like demoting a new person was something easily done.\u201cPfft!\u201d Jun Mo Xie spat out a mouthful of tea onto Tang Yuan\u2019s face and coughed.\u201cYour uncle really listens to your words! Eldest Young Master Tang, don\u2019t you think that what you did was a little too much? No matter how you look at it, he was still a gifted scholar, and a graduate of Wenxing Institute of Knowledge to boot, a person with some capabilities. This kind of action is simply too insulting\u2026\u201d\u201cToo insulting? Third Young Master, I find these words of yours disagreeable. What kind of qualifications do those people have? They are nothing more than a bunch of bookworms! So what if all they had learnt was the heavenly way of bringing peace and prosperity to the country?They are only capable of discussing it on paper, never having the desire to use it, letting it rot in them! Having a great deal of knowledge does not equate having a great deal of ability; most importantly, it does not equate having a great character! With just a glib mouth, how can one be considered a talent?These men have no significance at all! Wenxing Institute of Knowledge? Nothing but an exaggeration! In this long history of Tianxiang Kingdom, how many famed people did the Wenxing Institute produce? Pui!\u201dTang Yuan let out a small laugh and patted Jun Mo Xie on the shoulder.\u201cThird Young Master, neither of us can be considered good people.\u201d\u201cHold it! What do you mean \u2018neither of us can be considered good people\u2019?\u201dListening to Tang Yuan, Jun Mo Xie had originally agreed with him multiple times, secretly applauding. He deeply agreed with this perspective; when those students who graduated with top scores from the examination-oriented schools had just entered the workforce, they would be nothing when compared to the once-mature social elites in practice. It seems that no matter what place, there some things that are similar.Unexpectedly, Tang Yuan actually possessed such a kind of perspective. As Jun Mo Xie was feeling refreshed from hearing those words, Tang Yuan had unexpectedly managed to change the subject eloquently, causing him to feel shocked. The difference between those two subjects was as vast as the difference between Heaven and Earth, North, and South. This difference was simply too astonishing.\u201cHaha\u2026 what I meant was, neither one of us are good men,\u201dTang Yuan laughed out.\u201cBut, no matter how wicked we may be, even if we are to go out and purposely do harm every day, how many people in this vast city can we harm? A thousand people would already be considered an accomplished number, don\u2019t you think?However, look at Zhao Chengsong, a spineless bastard without a single bit of character in him. If someone like him were to be appointed as an official, then one wicked action from him will be enough to cause harm to countless commoners! Not to mention, even after causing such a calamity, he could have easily just moved away to another place and continued repeating his actions.As long as the royal court does not get rid him, he would continue causing harm to others! By the time he gets dealt with, how many people would have already been harmed by him? If we were to compare him with the two of us combined, which one would be truly evil?\u201dTang Yuan suddenly became resentful after saying all that.\u201cThat is why this senior would choose to humiliate those shameless things! Gifted Scholars? They are nothing but a bunch of gifted sons of bitches! At any rate, anyone who dares to claim to be a gifted scholar in front of this senior will be flattened to their death! As long as these hypocritical gifted scholars fall into my hands, they can forget ever escaping my grasp!\u201dJun Mo Xie laughed loudly. \u201cWell said, Fatty Tang.\u00a0This must be the first agreeable thing that I had heard from you! Well said indeed! Just by what you have said earlier, I shall toast this cup to you!\u201dThis toast was one Jun Mo Xie had given truthfully from the bottom of his heart. Tang Yuan\u2019s words just now have won over Jun Mo Xie\u2019s heart. For Jun Mo Xie who had transmigrated over, a man of two worlds, the number of people that qualified for Jun Mo Xie\u2019s toast were probably no more than three. For Tang Yuan to be able to receive this toast from Jun Mo Xie showed how much fortune he has! Tang Yuan was the first person to receive a toast from Jun Mo Xie in this world!After having drunk down this cup, it meant that Jun Mo Xie had already approved of Tang Yuan! Even though he was a debauchee, he was a true villain with true character!Jun Mo Xie had always acted on his whims.Even if someone he favored were to be condemned by everyone, he would still drink together with that person.Even if someone he disliked were to be applauded as a saint by everyone, he would still ignore that person!At this moment, Fatty Tang has no understanding towards the extent of value that this cup of wine contained. Naturally, he would never have predicted that due to this cup of wine, he would be able to survive from several calamities! He would be saved from situations of life and death by Jun Mo Xie! However, that story would come later.Tang Yuan gulped down the cup of wine in one go, his small eyes gazing around.\u201cI know what type of person I am, my looks aren\u2019t good, gambling is my favorite, fighting makes me feel good, and bullying people even more so, when I see beautiful ladies, I must say some flowery words to relieve my boredom. I have a bad heart, but I also have the courage to be bad!I am a bad guy, but I am one who does bad things in broad daylight! As the saying goes, when a lady is beautiful, everyone would turn their heads. If a woman is beautiful, everyone would want to look at her longer. If you do not let us look at you, then is there any damned reason to you being born so beautiful? If some beautiful lady from some damned good family notices me looking at them like this, they would surely run away and hide.On the other hand, I too will have no interest in pursuing a clear dead-end. But those who choose to continue standing there to tempt me even after seeing the way I look at them, can they be considered good? And yet, they actually dared to tell others that I am a detestable, unforgivable baddie!Look at those hypocrites; when they see a beautiful lady, they would quickly lower their heads to bow, showing a look of virtue and piousness. But after the lady turned away, they would quickly raise their heads to stare at that lady\u2019s big ass while salivating, secretly desiring fleshly pleasures! Pui! That is a gifted scholar for you! A gifted scholar with nothing but a dick for brains! I yearn for the day I can eradicate all such gifted scholars!\u201dAfter having vented his opinions, Fatty Tang became depressed, pouring one cup of wine after another, gulping each one down without reserve. His hands never stopped moving as he consumed more wine. Even though the wine was light and weak in strength, the amount he was consuming linked with his sadness and caused him to start becoming drunk. His eyes became vacant as his head swayed back and forth, eventually, he was unable to tolerate it and end up falling face first into a bowl of hot fish soup. He then wailed and woke up with a start!Jun Mo Xie looked at Tang Yuan who had fish soup dripping from his face and made up his mind.Since I have decided to have Qin Hu and his son dealt with, I might as well let the Tang Family handle it. With consideration of how desperate Tang Wan Li is, he would surely rather have a thousand innocents die than let go of one criminal\u2026 Not to mention my current state of strength is still lacking and the men I am training still cannot be sent out.If Grandpa were to come out to do it, it would cause a big ruckus\u2026 Very well! I shall do it like this! This is the only way to successfully resolve this important matter! Pui! Getting rid of a bunch of garbage cannot even be considered an important matter!Jun Mo Xie did not want to mobilize the Jun Family forces for one reason: Xuan Core! The Xuan Core was a terrifyingly vast whirlpool of problems. Even though Qin Hu\u2019s expression was not enough to guarantee that he was connected to the theft of the Xuan Core, should it ever happen that he was connected to the theft, if the Jun Family were to act with exterminating Northern City Clan, it would be equal to admitting their guilt in this matter?This would be like ending up in a pit of mud for the whole world to see. The Tang Family, on the other hand, have no such concerns.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cFatty Tang, since we have eaten our fill, what do you say we get a change of scenery? I feel that the Red Joy Establishment is quite clean and quiet. What do you think?\u201d Jun Mo Xie was obviously intending to do something evil, but instead, put on a pious appearance.\u201cRed Joy Establishment? That is certainly a clean and quiet place, a very very good place, haha\u2026\u201dTang Yuan\u2019s eyes brightened and he emerged from his drunken stupor, his face twisting with desire.\u201cHahaha, Third Young Master\u2026 you are a true friend indeed. Come, come, come! Let\u2019s head there immediately! It just so happened that these few days have caused me no small amount of frustration, I am truly in the need of a clean and quiet place\u2026\u201d He impatiently stood up, his fat belly falling all the way down to his thigh.Jun Mo Xie Xie observed Tang Yuan with a straight face and wondered inwardly.He was having a hard time imagining how he intended on proceeding after entering the Red Joy Establishment. Could it be that he would use both hands to prop up his belly? But if he does not, it would be really hard to proceed. What a headache\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was not that Jun Mo Xie did not want to explain his plans here, but his senses told him that someone was spying on him in this building. This feeling made him very uncomfortable. Thus, he had suggested going to the \u2018quiet\u2019 Red Joy Establishment.After Jun Mo Xie and Tang Yuan had left the building, a voice sounded out within a private lounge in the building. \u201cBrother Li, they have already left. What do you see?\u201dA gentle voice replied back.\u201cThis Tang Yuan has some knowledge, but that is only what he has going for. He far too reckless. Even if someone like him harbors any ill intentions towards us, he would definitely charge to us in the open. Thus\u2026 he is of no concern. As for Jun Mo Xie\u2026 His actions have been different from what I have heard about him.\u201d There was a sense of doubt in his tone.\u201cOh? According to Brother Li\u2026 there is something wrong with that little Jun brat?\u201dThe first voice replied in a doubtful voice.\u201cHowever, this brat seemed to be the same frivolous and greedy person. You can see it just now, he was even extorting Qin Hu to that extent. This brat\u2019s appetite is actually quite something. Even I did not expect that he would ask for all of the casinos owned by the Northern City Clan. Haha\u2026 What a load of nonsense! Is he not afraid of choking to death?\u201d\u201cThere are some matters that you are not aware of. This is not the only time that Jun Mo Xie had acted strangely. Something is definitely not right. Get Li Yan to handle this matter, tell him to inform Qin Hu to go to Jun Mo Xie tomorrow afternoon. Qin Hu must note down every single word said by Jun Mo Xie, without missing a single word. After that, have it be sent to me orderly. I have a need to analyze this matter properly.\u201dThis second person mused as his fingers lightly tapped the table. Recalling Jun Mo Xie\u2019s actions earlier, he shook his head.From the way he talks about the way he acts, he is obviously just a typical debauchee, why is it that I am feeling something strange about it? Am I being too sensitive? No! It is better to be safe than sorry!\u201cIn the next few days, try to find an excuse to meet Jun Mo Xie,\u201d the \u2018Brother Li\u2019 slowly said.\u201cThere have been reports stating that this brat has been spending the past few days undergoing intense training at home. There have already been quite a few of these reports, making me feel apprehensive. I want to see if it is true or not.\u201d\u201cI? You want me to go see Jun Mo Xie?\u201d The other person replied in a reluctant tone. His tone seemed to imply that the act of meeting Jun Mo Xie was a very shameful one. A extremely shameful thing.\u201cYou are still so arrogant! This arrogance will be your undoing,\u201dThe \u2018Brother Li\u2019 raised his head, his features delicate. He was none other than Li You Ran. Even though those words were spoken lightly, the other person suddenly broke out in cold sweat.\u201cI understand, I will return to make the arrangements.\u201d\u201cGood, when that happens, I will be around to observe. I will see just what this Jun Mo Xie is planning,\u201d Li You Ran lightly said.\u201cBy the way, Brother Li, I received news that the Second may be making a move these few days; it seems he is already becoming impatient. However, I am unsure if his target is the Third or Princess Ling Meng. Our source is being very cautious; we are unable to gather more news\u2026\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Li You Ran gave out a sigh with a gentle voice. Slowly lowering his voice, he replied. \u201cThe Second is quite the fool. Making a move now would be his own undoing. En\u2026 For now, we shall only observe at the sidelines. Not doing anything would be the best action for now.\u201d\u201cBut, Princess Ling Meng is the one you fancy\u2026\u201d The other person seemed fearful of continuing his sentence.\u201cNo matter, in the end, she is but a woman. If her life is the price I have to pay to cause a river of blood to flow from the First, Second and Third, then I would gladly wish for it,\u201dLi You Ran gently replied as he maintained a calm demeanor, though an absolute aura of coldness seeped out from him.\u201cIn the face of history, a mere woman\u2026 is of no concern!\u201dAs the words were spoken, the lounge area became deadly silent.On the road\u2026Jun Mo Xie was seated as far as possible from Tang Yuan within the carriage, trying hard to maintain himself. Even for someone who was once the King of Assassins, enduring the stench of fat coming from Fatty Tang\u2019s body was no easy feat, Jun Mo Xie felt as though he may not be able to hold on.Jun Mo Xie opened the carriage curtains to let the air in. \u201cFatty Tang, from what you have told me, it seems like you have been suffering quite a bit at home.\u201dTang Yuan who originally looked enthusiastic slumped down. He waved his hand as he feebly replied.\u201cThird Young Master, if you consider yourself my brother then do not bring this up again. Once I think about it, I get the urge to just hang myself. How could I be so unlucky? Have you ever seen people being hit by such a situation? But why is it that this keeps happening to me again and again? Third Young Master, I really am\u2026 unlucky!\u201d\u201cThen, do you want to rid yourself of this problematic situation?\u201d Jun Mo Xie gave out a sinister laughter, tempting Tang Yuan.\u201cOf course I want, why would I not want? Only a real bastard would not want to! But, this is not a matter that can be easily resolved!\u201d Tang Yuan scratched his head, his expression twisted.\u201cDon\u2019t say things like easy or difficult. All I am asking is whether you want to rid yourself of this miserable life!\u201d Jun Mo Xie asked, as he led the \u201cfish\u201d towards the bait, his eyes staring at Fatty Tang!\u201cI want, I really want!\u201d Tang Yuan burst out with excitement. \u201cThird Young Master, could it be you have a plan?\u201d\u201cI do not have many plans, but I do have a few tricks. And any of these tricks will be enough for you to escape from your current predicament. Are you interested?\u201d Jun Mo Xie chuckled as he shook his legs.\u201cI am interested! \u2026 Third Young Master! My dear brother! Brother Jun! Uncle Jun! Ancestor! \u2026 Please tell me quickly, I really cannot take any more of this,\u201dAt this moment, Tang Yuan felt as though he had grasped onto a life-saving rope, he quickly became excited, panting for breath and almost bursting into tears.\u201cToday, we saw how arrogant that Northern City Clan was, did we not? In addition, they also made you feel very unhappy, did they not?\u201d Jun Mo Xie mentioned while laughing lightly.\u201cUnhappy? Those two sons of bitches made me really vexed! If not for the problem back at home, I would have already exterminated them! I will not even bother to meet him when they deliver the money tomorrow!\u201d Tang Yuan shook his head. \u201cThird Young Master, quick tell me what your plan is. Why did you bring up this two rubbish for?\u201d\u201cIs this not a method? Tang Yuan, I am sure that not many people have known that something was stolen from your house right?\u201d Jun Mo Xie smiled.\u201cThere were many who had known that our house had been robbed! It is normal to have items get stolen, but the info of what was actually stolen is a completely different thing. If people were to find out that a Ninth level Xuan Core was stolen from our house, then my family would become a laughing stock for generations to come. Externally, we only announced that we are chasing after some runaway slaves and enemies,\u201d Tang Yuan mumbled. He was becoming confused as to what kind of solution Jun Mo Xie was trying to give him.\u201cBut if my guess is correct, Qin Hu is aware of all of that,\u201d Jun Mo Xie shook his legs again. \u201cYou may have noticed earlier, but when you mentioned that something was stolen from your Tang Family, Qin Hu\u2019s became flustered, his body seemingly breaking out in cold sweat.\u201d In truth, there was only a slight change in Qin Hu\u2019s eyes whereas his face showed no change. As for the sweat, that was non-existent. However, Fatty Tang was not paying any attention and could no longer remember.\u201cYou mean\u2026 Qin Hu is connected to this matter?\u201d Tang Yuan instantly stood up, his body straight, his small eyes moving in circles. What Jun Mo Xie had just said was too important.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAny mistakes were simply unacceptable. If this was just an ordinary thing, then Tang Yuan would easily believe in whatever the Young Master Jun said.\u201cFatty, you are overthinking things. His connection to this matter does not matter at all, what matters is whether you think that he is connected to it. All you have to do is go back and tell your grandfather that Qin Hu and the Northern City Clan might be connected to this matter. That way, no matter what happens, regardless of whether Northern City Clan has any connection with this matter, the miserable situation that you are in will be lessened by quite a bit.\u201dJun Mo Xie laughed sinisterly.\u201cBesides, we are not accusing him of no reason. That flustered look on his face back then was certainly real. If he was not guilty, why would he show such a face?\u201d\u201cBut if my grandfather finds that out\u2026 if Qin Hu was not involved, then wouldn\u2019t I just end up in hotter soup?\u201d Tang Yuan hesitated.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As long as he receives a single thread of information, he would definitely go all out in chasing after it!\u201d Tang Yuan thought out loud. \u201cHowever, this needs to be done properly; otherwise my future days would be worse than before. Very well! I will do so!\u201dThe more he thought about it, the more he believed that he had a wonderful plan. Tang Yuan eventually became impatient and said.\u201cThird Young Master, how about I let my men send you over to the Red Joy Establishment so that you can enjoy the \u201cquietness\u201d there. I need to go back quickly to report to my grandfather. Otherwise, if grandfather finds out that I had visited a brothel after finding out about this instead of reporting immediately, my situation will surely become worse.\u201d\u201cIt is indeed as you have said. But since you have something going on, how could I have the mood to go to the brothel as well? I will just find someplace to play around,\u201d Jun Mo Xie laughed. \u201cFatty Tang, congratulations! You are about to obtain freedom.\u201dTang Yuan smiled wide, akin to the Buddha, Maitreya. \u201cThis is all thanks to brother\u2019s advice.\u201dAfter declining Tang Yuan\u2019s offer to escort him back, Jun Mo Xie descended from the carriage and the both of them parted ways. Observing Tang Yuan\u2019s carriage moving away, Jun Mo Xie\u2019s face revealed a smile.If the Tang Family were to take action, what should his next step be? The Xuan Core was resting on his hands and yet he had no clue on how to utilize it. How should he solve this problem?Should I spread the news of this item out to attract some high ranked experts into Tianxiang City? In this vast world, there were many capable people. Some of these capable men would surely know what is it that I required.However, this matter needs to be concealed from Grandpa and Third Uncle. With Grandpa\u2019s upright and honest nature, Third Uncle\u2019s straightforward character, they would definitely choose to return it to the Tang Family. In addition, if they were to accidentally leak out this information, then the resulting trouble would be huge.It would be better for me to tell them after using the Xuan Core on Third Uncle or Grandpa. That is right, I will hand them a done deal\u2026 that way, we can silently prosper!The Art of Unlocking Heaven\u2019s Fortune was capable of providing Jun Mo Xie with divine powers and was fundamentally different from the cultivation of Xuan Qi.Jun Mo Xie believed that this highly coveted Xuan Core was of no use to him.However, even though the Xuan Core was of no use to the Art of Unlocking Heaven\u2019s Fortune, it could have still helped him in some other areas. Unfortunately, he had no idea about this matter\u2026Should I attend the Gifted Scholar\u2019s Autumn Festival Feast tomorrow?He thought about it while walking onwards. After walking for who knew how far, he finally decided. Feeling his flying knives, he sighed. After the confrontation that occurred last time, he had finally understood that his self-made flying knives were ineffective against the Xuan Qi experts of this world.The flying daggers ended up bending and some even broke even though the enemy was only at the Silver Xuan rank. What would happen if the opponent was at the Gold Xuan or Jade Xuan? When thinking about such a possibility, Jun Mo Xie broke out in cold sweat. The one thing he could be certain of was that with the quality of metal used, the flying knives produced were insufficient against a highly capable expert! It most likely did not even have the capability of inflicting fatal wounds.Since Jun Mo Xie\u2019s strength has yet to reach a level he was comfortable with, he must first create several weapons for him to defend himself. At the very least, the projectile weapons he made must first, be able to penetrate the defense of a Jade Xuan expert\u2019s body. This was but his most minimal of conditions! However, normal metals would not be able to do so.Jun Mo Xie continued forward with his head lowered as he made his way to the \u2018Divine Weapons Store\u2019. In order for him to get the required materials to make his flying knives, this store may be the only place in the Kingdom to be able to provide it. By Jun Mo Xie\u2019s understanding, the best material available here would be mysterious iron, next will be the cold iron which would be an acceptable replacement. If those two materials were unavailable, then he would need to resort to fine steel.After parting ways with Jun Mo Xie, Tang Yuan excitedly rushed back home. Once he arrived, he immediately requested an audience with his grandfather.For the past few days, Tang Wan Li had been feeling extremely irritable. Not only was his most important item, the Xuan Core, stolen but there was also no news or leads at all.This made him even more furious. His mind kept wandering back towards Tang Yuan. If not for this debauchee\u2019s stupid mess with the gambling incident, something like this would have never happened. The more he thought about it, the more furious he became. He eventually decided to order the servants to summon Tang Yuan here so that he can vent out his fury.Just as he was calling out, a servant suddenly came in to report that the Eldest Young Master was seeking an audience. He became surprised. Even without the current situation, meeting this brat was difficult to even on normal days. These days, Tang Yuan would hide as much as he could, and yet he suddenly had the guts to come forward himself? Could it be that he has gone mad from the scolding? \u201cBring him in!\u201d After thinking for a bit, he added. \u201cAnd the iron abacus too!\u201dRight after he entered, the first thing Tang Yuan saw was the iron abacus, causing his face become increasing twisted.\u201cWhat kind of problem have you created this time?\u201d Tang Wan Li was very angry! As he asked, his chin pointed to the iron abacus, signaling for Tang Yuan to kneel on it before saying anything. How would he not understand his grandson? The only reason Tang Yuan would request to meet him would be if he had caused an unsolvable problem! If not for that, Tang Yuan would never ever come to him!Tang Yuan\u2019s face was filled with bitterness as he sadly knelt down, his fat belly slamming into the ground, causing a clear sound to be heard.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Looking at the belly of his grandson touching the floor, he found himself unable to become angry. \u201cWould it kill you to lose some weight? Or have you already chosen to live as a pig?\u201dTang Yuan was originally excited as he thought of giving a huge contribution. But after receiving such a kind of treatment the moment he reached home, he became dejected.Looking at his own belly, he solemnly replied. \u201cIt is not like I wanted to be this fat\u2026 having received your scolding for the past few days, I could not even eat properly. But, even if I only drink water\u2026\u201d\u201cEnough! Just tell me why you came here!\u201d Tang Wan Li felt angry and yet felt like laughing. \u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense, just what kind of trouble did you cause this time?\u201d\u201cGrandpa, I\u2026\u201d Tang Yuan suddenly became excited as he thought of what Jun Mo Xie said about him being free from this miserable circumstance. Unable to help himself, he stood up, ignoring the furious expression on his grandfather\u2019s face. \u201cGrandpa, I think I may have found a lead on the stolen Xuan Core.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Tang Wan Li who was originally about to become enraged and planned to have Tang Yuan kneel down again became surprised. His eyes bulged widely as he ignored what happened earlier. \u201cQuick, spit out what you know.\u201d\u201cEver since the day the Xuan Core was stolen, your grandchild has been plagued with worry day and night. For the past few days, All I have ever thought of was this matter; I threw both my heart and soul into thinking and analyzing what had happened, I used my mind and body to pore through all possibilities carefully, ensuring that I was squeezing every last bit of effort I could muster\u2026\u201d Tang Yuan showed a sincere expression on his face, as though he had decided to turn over a new leaf and become a better person.\u201cStop! Stop stop stop!\u201d Tang Wan Li shouted angrily. \u201cWould you prefer to kneel down on that before telling me what happened?\u201d He pointed at the iron abacus.Tang Yuan became startled. \u201cToday, I went out looking for clues. Then, in the Drunken Immortal Establishment, I met the Northern City Clan Leader, Qin Hu\u2019s, son, Qin Xiao Bao.That Qin Xiao Bao was arrogant and held an overbearing behavior as he bullied the innocent commoners. Seeing this, grandchild could not help but become angry. Due to Grandpa\u2019s teachings, grandchild was unable to put up with his despicable ways. The anger in my heart rose to the Heavens, and the winds accompanied me as I stepped forward to fight in the name of righteousness to save those who could not protect themselves! When chancing upon injustice, one must take up arms to offer assistance, for fighting for the sake of righteousness, for the people and for the country\u2026 and uh, after that, Qin Hu brought a number of men to make a fuss! But when he found out it was me, he panicked.\u201d Tang Yuan\u2019s ability to flaunt his own actions were truly extraordinary, every word he uttered had painted him in a good light.\u201cNonsense! Who is this Qin Hu? How would he even dare to provoke us? How can he not panic? Is this your so-called lead?\u201d Tang Wan Li scoffed out.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWhat kind of nonsensical lead is this? And here I was actually putting hope into the words of this useless grandson of mine\u2026Hearing Tang Yuan\u2019s words of self-praise, Tang Wan Li\u2019s face had turned black and swollen from rage.\u201cGrandpa, if Qin Hu had been panicking since the beginning, then I would be thinking the same as you. But, he actually did not show such a reaction at the beginning. It was only after I mentioned that a theft had happened in our house that Qin Hu\u2019s expression changed, as though he had met a ghost.\u201dTang Yuan put on the air of a master detective as he slowly came to a conclusion.\u201cExternally, everyone believes that only money and jewelry were stolen from our house. This was the reason we had given as to why were chasing after the thieves. Under such circumstances, this matter would have no relations with Qin Hu at all. So, why would he show such a shocked expression? Your grandchild believes that there something smells fishy! It might even be possible that Qin Hu was the one who committed this crime!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You bastard! You actually have nothing to say after reaching the key point? You want to die?\u201dTang Wan Li lashed out with a kick onto Tang Yuan\u2019s buttocks with rage.\u201cHow can you suspect this Qin Hu\u2019s Northern City Clan with just this few things? What exactly happened? Start from the beginning! And explain everything clearly, if there are any parts I don\u2019t understand, I will rip out your fat skin!\u201dTang Yuan became helpless. After seeing his plan failing, he obediently reported everything that had happened.Tang Wan Li listened carefully before squinting his eyes. After hearing about Jun Mo Xie giving the idea to Tang Yuan, he interrupted Tang Yuan and asked. \u201cCould it be that bastard Jun Mo Xie has any disputes with the Northern City Clan?\u201d\u201cHuh? No! How could that be? With his character, if the Northern CIty Clan had any feud with him, he would have personally destroyed that little clan a long time ago. How could the Northern City Clan still survive if that was the case?\u201d Tang Yuan quickly denied.\u201cIndeed, Jun Mo Xie should not be trying to frame Qin Hu. Just with his family\u2019s power, there was no need for him to let our side handle it. However, I have some doubts about that Jun Mo Xie. That being said, he should not be capable of creating such a strategy to harm others.\u201d Tang Wan Li stroked his beard.\u201cBut\u2026 Grandpa, to our family, the Xuan Core is indeed too valuable. At such a critical time, it would be better to chase after every little information that we have.\u201d Seeing his plans close to succeeding, Tang Yuan quickly added on.\u201cCorrect! I would rather have something to believe in than nothing at all! Besides, the one I am dealing with is but a small clan, can I not handle them if I wish to? This is but just an act of helping the common man get rid of a evil tumor!\u201d Tang Wan Li violently stood up.\u201cJust based on that incident alone, saying that they are connected is indeed too far-fetched. However, it is true that the great clans within the city had been presumptuous lately. Especially this Northern City Clan; I have heard that they have done no small amount of evil deeds recently. Since I had also missed these few small clans during my investigation. I might as well start from the Northern City Clan and question them first. Hopefully, a lead could be found there,\u201dTang Wan Li thought about it. Even though he did not place many hopes into it, if there was even a glimmer of hope, then he had to at least check it out.\u201cRelay my orders, all those at the Ninth Xuan Qi and above are to assemble immediately. We will be taking action tonight! Remember that, until the matter is over, they must not kill senselessly! I will need them to be alive for me to gather information!\u201d\u201cUnderstood!\u201d Tang Yuan was overjoyed. Third Young Master Jun\u2019s plan was indeed amazing. His grandfather had already changed his treatment of him. Haha\u2026This plan from Jun Mo Xie was fundamentally born of his distaste of the Northern City Clan. Those that had managed to earn the Evil Monarch\u2019s ire can forget about living.However, Jun Mo Xie had too many concerns about the aftermath of moving against them himself. Thus, he had pushed it to Tang Yuan to handle.As for Tang Yuan, the reason he had easily accepted this role was simply to make his life better. He could no longer stand being treated like a mouse in his own home, fearing being beaten and having others curse at him every day.As for Tang Wan Li, he decided to act on it because he was holding on to the hope that it was related to the Xuan Core. After all, having some hope is always better than having no hope. Besides, even if they were not involved, he could also use this opportunity to wipe out a harmful group for the sake of the common man. No matter what result this incident brought, as long as he could publicize crimes that the Northern City Clan had committed, the reputation of the Tang Family would surely rise. That way, regardless of what he did to them, the masses would gladly accept it.Besides, Northern City Clan was the weakest amongst the six great clans; they did not even have any supporting powers behind them. There was not even a need for discretion in moving against them! In addition, there was a possibility that if it turned out that this action would bring a potential lead towards the Xuan Core.However, Jun Mo Xie, Tang Yuan, and Tang Wan Li did not know something. They expect that this action that they have taken would end up being a lucky hit! This would end up becoming an unexpected surprise for them! The conclusion to their actions would all come tonight.As for Li You Ran\u2019s arrangement to have Qin Hu investigate Jun Mo Xie, his instructions had only just arrived at Qin Hu. But unfortunately, Tang Wan Li had already mobilized his forces\u2026It would appear that Li You Ran\u2019s plans would be foiled yet again. Without any rhyme or reason, his plans would be torn apart. All because of two debauchees, one who could not tolerate the sinful existence of Northern City Clan, while the other who had just wanted to get rid of his miserable situation at home. These two selfish debauchees had somehow managed to destroy a plan that was meticulously thought up by Li You Ran\u2026Is this what Heaven\u2019s will is like?Jun Mo Xie proceeded slowly along the way. The Divine Weapons Store was just ahead. Before the shop was a luxurious carriage bearing a crest with two crossed swords!This was the special crest belonging only to the Dugu Family! Someone from the Dugu Family was here!Jun Mo Xie was shocked but did not pay it any attention as he slowly strode inside. If this was the original debauchee, Jun Mo Xie, he would not dare to cross paths with a member of the Dugu Family. However, this Jun Mo Xie was different! What does he need to fear from the Dugu Family?\u201cDear Young Master, what kind of weapon are you looking for?\u201d As he entered the shop, a middle-aged man came forth. There was no small number of Young Masters like Jun Mo Xie within the city. All of them favored the habit of carrying a magnificent looking sword. However, these swords would only have the purpose as a decorative item with no real ability to kill. Naturally, these weapons had no real practicality.\u201cI am not here to buy ready-made weapons. I am here to inquire; do you have the cold iron for sale? Money is not an issue!\u201d Jun Mo Xie laughed out, portraying a look of wealth and power.The man\u2019s eyes flashed as he thought to himself: I thought this kid was just a debauchee. Could it be that he is actually an experienced professional? I cannot afford to make this mistake! He appraised Jun Mo Xie once more before replying.\u201cIt turns out that Young Master here is a professional. However, our shop currently does not have any cold iron, as it is something too hard to procure normally. Would a Hundred Tempered Steel Iron suffice instead?\u201dJun Mo Xie chuckled and replied.\u201cIf it has truly been tempered a hundred times\u2026 then it would suffice, however, this Hundred Tempered Steel Iron\u2026 has it truly been tempered a hundred times?\u201dThe middle-aged man\u2019s face showed an awkward expression of embarrassment.\u201cYoung Master here is a true professional. Although my shop\u2019s Hundred Tempered Iron has only been tempered around ten times, the quality is indeed above the norm. Even if it is to be compared to others around the world, it can be considered one of the best.\u201d\u201cTen times\u2026 I understand. In that case, what about Mysterious Iron? Do you have any?\u201d Jun Mo Xie sighed. How terrible! Could the technology of this world be lacking by ten thousand years as compared to Earth? Putting his hopes into their forging methods would be hopeless. As of right now, all he could do was hope to find some special metals!\u00a0When it comes to special metals, the Mysterious Iron was the best!\u201cThere is none in this shop\u2026\u201d The middle-aged man wiped his sweat. Why was this man asking for all sorts of materials that were hard to procure? He suddenly remembered something. \u201cBut a few days ago, we received a piece of Meteoric Iron. Would that be good enough?\u201d\u201cMeteoric Iron?!\u201d Jun Mo Xie\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cLet\u2019s me go and take a look!\u201dWhen asking for the Mysterious Iron back then, Jun Mo Xie was only hoping for a \u201cwhat if\u201d. He had fully expected there to be none. Unexpectedly, they had managed to have the Meteoric Iron! Even though the Mysterious Iron was rare, the rarity of the Meteoric Iron was even higher. It seemed that his luck was quite good!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euJun Mo Xie followed the middle-aged man through the storeroom as they walked into the store behind the shop. Before they had even reached the storeroom, a clear voice could be heard from within. \u201cExcellent! I want this Meteoric Iron.\u201dThe owner of the voice was someone that Jun Mo Xie had feared the most \u2013 Dugu Xiao Yi of the Dugu Family!Why am I always bumping into her? How frightening!Jun Mo Xie\u2019s heart started beating hurriedly; he quickly stepped through the door. Without waiting for anyone to say anything, he quickly opened his mouth. \u201cHahaha\u2026 Miss Dugu, I did not expect that we would meet again in such a place. This must truly be fate.\u201d\u201cIt is you? Jun Mo Xie?\u201d Dugu Xiao Yi turned around, her eyes sparkled as she straightened her chest. \u201cJun Mo Xie, you are far too irregular. Why is it that I would end up meeting you no matter where I go, you are just like a clingy ghost! How strange!\u201d Suddenly, she jumped, pushing her face before Jun Mo Xie, asking viciously. \u201cJun Mo Xie, you are not stalking me on purpose, are you?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The number of beauties there is numerous and not only that, they are tender and..ouch!!!\u201dDugu Xiao Yi\u2019s usually pretty and white face turned incensed, her delicate hands twisted Jun Mo Xie\u2019s arms, her pair of beautiful eyes staring straight at him as she asked, each word emphasised.\u201cWhat\u2026 Did\u2026 You\u2026 Say?\u201d\u201cA gentleman fight with words and not their hands!\u201dJun Mo Xie said in a stern and righteous manner. With a bitter face, he continued.\u201cElder sister, please give me a break, there is no need to tire your delicate hands on me.\u201d\u201cHmph! Say it! What ulterior motives do you have for following me? Speak quickly! If you do not, then I cannot guarantee the safety of your ears,\u201dDugu Xiao Yi did not seem to loosen her grip at all.Jun Mo Xie was well aware that she was someone who would keep her words, without a fear of the consequences. Turning around, Jun Mo Xie smiled.\u201cWasn\u2019t Miss Dugu planning to just buy a piece of iron? Since that is the case\u2026 how about if this little brother pay for it?\u201d\u201cYou?\u201dDugu Xiao Yi suddenly remembered that Jun Mo Xie had not given her any of the recently won precious treasures back then. Thinking about it, her heart became frustrated and she flared up with anger.\u201cObviously you are the one who should pay for it! Back then, the both of us were partners and managed to win so much money, but yet you haven\u2019t given me any of it to me! If not for my good luck, could you have won so much? Since you have won so many treasures thanks to my luck, then you might as well take this opportunity to repay me.\u201dAfter saying that, she sudden broke out into laughter. She held out her hands, using it to measure the length of a short sword, a small fang could be seen on her smile. \u201cI want to make a short sword, about this length\u2026 It will be able to be kept hidden in my sleeves so it must be thin. Don\u2019t you think its a good idea?Jun Mo Xie\u2019s felt sweat on his forehead. This girl was really able to speak, she had only acted as a witness. And she had also played across the board, winning twenty thousand silver liangs, after which she snatched up at least a hundred silver liangs worth of bills already. Now, her role had suddenly transformed into that of a partner, and saying what had happened was only due to her good luck\u2026And in order for her to create a small sword she had wanted, she had desired the whole piece of Meteoric Iron. What would one call the act of destroying a priceless treasure? This was a prime example of such a thing\u2026The piece of Meteoric Iron was approximately the size of two basketballs. Its entire body exuded a strange color, seemingly similar to the special color exuded by the aluminum alloy from Jun Mo Xie\u2019s past life.However, it was clearly purer; with several irregular patterns on its surface. With just a glance, Jun Mo Xie judged that it was of a higher quality compared to the Mysterious Iron! It was at this moment that Jun Mo Xie made the decision.No matter what I have to do, be it swindling or blackmail, I must obtain this piece of Meteoric Iron. Something of such good quality could only shine when placed in a master\u2019s hands!\u201cBoss, how much for this piece of scrap iron?\u201dUsing his legs, Jun Mo Xie slovenly kicked the block of Meteoric Iron, his mouth turning crooked and his eyes becoming slanted as he asked.This caused the middle-aged man who led him inside to become surprised. This Young Master had just spoken to him earlier while giving off the impression of an experienced professional, his demeanor and speech calm and collected. But after meeting this beautiful young lady, he would suddenly turn into such a disgusting looking person? What kind of game was he playing at?Could this be what they call going crazy over a beauty? How troublesome! Beauties are really the cause of all troubles in the world!\u201cUh, hehe, Young Master, this piece was found at\u2026\u201d The boss was a slightly hunched old man.Without waiting for him to continue, Jun Mo Xie interrupted him in an impatient manner.\u201cDo not talk nonsense; all you need to do is state your price. This Young Master has nothing but money! If something catches my attention, then even if it is a rotten piece of iron, it would become a treasure! As for this scrap iron, just state your price!\u201d\u201cI understand,\u201dIn order to be able to open a shop in the capital city, the boss was highly experienced. He could clearly see that the Young Master before him was likely one of the highly prestigious debauchees. How could someone like him provoke one of these monstrous people?\u00a0He quickly replied.\u201cThis iron\u2019s origin is extraordinary. It is valued at eighty thousand silver liangs. However, if Young Master and Young Mistress here wish for us to forge it into a weapon for you, then it would require an additional five thousand silver liangs\u2026\u201d\u201cOh? Eighty thousand liangs? So cheap? This Young Master will buy it!\u201dJun Mo Xie put on the expression of someone who had so much money that he did not even know his own family name. He then kicked another block of iron.\u201cWhat about this broken stuff?\u201d Jun Mo Xie radiated an overbearing aura; however, the block of iron he indicated was no ordinary iron. It was a piece of finely Tempered Steel Iron, its size far outstripped that of the Meteoric Iron, its body exuding a dark red color.\u201cThis is a piece of Hundred Tempered Steel Iron. Even though it is not as good as the Meteoric Iron, it would still cost two thousand silver liangs,\u201d The boss answered almost immediately. He could clearly observe that this senseless Young Master before him was one without much patience. The price of two thousand silver liangs was enough for at least three families to live without worry for one whole generation. This price was indeed quite expensive. As for the eighty thousand silver liangs earlier, it was simply an amount that the common people could not even imagine. However, when placed before these super prodigal debauchees, this price was nothing but a dime.\u201cNot expensive, not expensive, in fact, it is quite cheap!\u201d Jun Mo Xie waved his hands. \u201cI will buy it all!\u201d He pulled out a stack of silver bills from his chest. Those were none other than his winnings from the other day. He spat out some saliva, then moistening his fingers on his lips, he pulled out ninety thousand worth in silver bills. He slapped the bills on his hands with a resounding \u201cpa\u201d. \u201cHere are ninety thousand liangs, keep the change!\u201dDugu Xiao Yi was observing all this from the side, her face slowly changed from a smile to disappointment. Slowly, she felt coldness appear in her heart. A look of disgust appeared on her face; a strange sensation filling her heart.I thought he had changed. It would appear that I had been mistaken. he is still the same old debauchee\u2026 Sigh!One hand was handing the money, while the other hand was receiving the goods. Jun Mo Xie quickly finished the transaction for both blocks of iron. As of now, the two blocks of iron had belonged to Jun Mo Xie alone.With a cold face, Dugu Xiao Yi asked. \u201cThird Young Master Jun, since you have paid for it, isn\u2019t it time for you to hand over the iron to me?\u201dIn her heart, she felt a pang of regret. If she had known that he had not changed at all, why would she still let him pay for it? In the end, it had caused her to become unhappy!If I had wanted to find someone to help me pay for it, there are the princes, the proper Young Masters from the noble families, officials\u2019 families. Would someone like Jun Mo Xie even get the chance? What a humiliation! Still, the Meteoric Iron is a rare material. I might as well just put up with him a little longer!\u201cIndeed! That is only natural!\u201d Jun Mo Xie laughed. \u201cMiss Dugu, there are two blocks of iron here. You want the big one and I want the small one. I am truly honored to be able to help Miss Dugu pay for it, haha\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d Dugu Xiao Yi was just about to head towards the block of Meteoric Iron when she heard something wrong. She could not help herself as her beautiful eyes widened; she almost could not believe her own ears.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI want the big one? You want the small one?\u201dDid he suddenly become an idiot? The small one is the Meteoric Iron, one not from this world. The big one is just the Hundred Tempered Steel Iron. Even though the quality is not bad, but when compared to the Meteoric Iron, it is basically comparing Heaven and Earth! Why would I even want normal Tempered Steel Iron for?\u201cIndeed,\u201d Jun Mo Xie answered naturally.\u201cJust look, I have already bought up those two scrap iron. But I only need a little. If I am to take the big one, then it would go to waste. As the saying goes, presents for a beautiful woman must naturally be bountiful. Naturally, this big block of iron must be gifted to beauties as well. Haha, naturally, that beauty is none other than Miss Dugu here. Ah\u2026 Of course, if Miss Dugu feels that it is still insufficient, then how about I buy more of them for you. The cost is but a few thousand liangs apiece, simply cheap stuff! How about I buy up ten of them and get a carriage to send it over to your residence?\u201dDugu Xiao Yi\u2019s whole body suddenly quivered in rage!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It had turned out that Jun Mo Xie was also after the Meteoric Iron. However, he was worried that she would buy the iron first. Thus, he had proposed to pay for it. And now that the payment was done, he had actually wanted to just give her a block of ordinary Tempered Steel Iron.Scrap iron? Why don\u2019t you try to find me a few of these scrap iron?This despicable Jun Mo Xie! By having the excuse of paying for the iron, he tricked me to gain possession of the Meteoric Iron!It just so happened that she was also not thinking clearly at the moment and didn\u2019t mention what iron she wanted, which was why he was able to trick her\u2026\u201cJun Mo Xie!!\u201d Dugu Xiao Yi screamed, her pretty eyes bulging out widely. \u201cDo you wish to die?\u201d\u201cA false accusation,\u201d Jun Mo Xie spread out his arms as he shrugged, a hint of innocent roguishness present on his face. \u201cWhat are you talking about, Miss Dugu? Of these two, I have already given you the bigger one, what more do you want? You had wanted to buy iron, and I have graciously bought it for you. And yet, you are able to curse at me\u2026 you\u2026 you are being too unjust towards me!\u201d\u201cYou! \u2026good\u2026 very good! Jun Mo Xie, you sure have guts! If you ever end up in my hands. I\u2026 I will never forgive you!\u201dDugu Xiao Yi bit her plump lips as her whole body trembled as her chest rose up and down. She was angered to the point of tears.\u00a0Tears appeared in the corner of her eyes before finally falling down.Jun Mo Xie felt rather awkward. In the first place, Dugu Xiao Yi was the one who had wanted to buy the iron. But he had used an tricked a little girl into giving him the iron which simply felt wrong. He tried to comfort her.\u201cWhat are you crying for? How about this? When I have started forging my weapon, I will make a precious blade for you as well. After that, I will send it straight to your residence. So, let us just call it even, all right?\u201d\u2026 Although Jun Mo Xie was a man of many talents, comforting women was definitely not one of his.\u201cWho wants your stinky blade?\u201d Dugu Xiao Yi did not know that Jun Mo Xie was actually making a real promise to her and merely thought that he was ridiculing her. She finally broke down in tears, her heart full of grief. \u201cThis iron was obviously mine in the first place\u2026\u201dTruthfully, Dugu Xiao Yi was not crying due to the loss of the Meteoric Iron. Even though the Meteoric Iron was something rare, it was honestly not too difficult to obtain considering the power and influence of the Dugu Family.The real reason she was crying was that of Jun Mo Xie\u2019s detestable actions. Putting on the airs of a debauchee, he had interrupted her in the midst of her purchase, then tricking her by offering to pay for it. He had also made her feel confused over her opinion about him and once everything was said and done, he ended up offering a piece of trash to her! To add insult to injury, he even put on a pious expression as he said.\u2018You want the big one and I want the small one\u2026 How can size be used to value this type of item?\u2019Of course, the biggest reason was that she had ended up falling for his trick. She herself became confused after seeing his pretentious portrayal of a debauchee and ended up being fooled by him\u2026Beads of tears fell down her face, signifying just how heartbroken Dugu Xiao Yi was feeling. She looked at Jun Mo Xie who was standing there like a wooden pole.He is not even bothering to comfort me!This made Dugu Xiao Yi even sadder, which turned her silent cry into her bawling her eyes out.\u201cUrgh, stop crying already, your face becomes twisted up when you cry and it end up becoming ugly!\u201d Jun Mo Xie frowned, his eyes squinting. Apparently, this was how he intended to console her.\u201cI want to cry! I don\u2019t need you to care! You\u2026 you\u2026 wuwuwu\u2026 who did you say is ugly?!\u201dThe word \u2018ugly\u2019 was definitely a taboo word for girls. There were many things in this world which could be endured and there were also things which could never be endured! Dugu Xiao Yi suddenly stopped crying, her glare like fire straight onto Jun Mo Xie.In an instant, anger rose up from within the depths of her heart and from the anger came an extreme loathing. She caught hold of Jun Mo Xie\u2019s arm, opened up her small mouth and bit down hard on Jun Mo Xie\u2019s arm. After biting his arm, she continued crying.\u201cOw! Ow!\u2026\u201d Jun Mo Xie\u2019s facial muscles twitched as he gritted his teeth, hissing. \u201cI\u2026 Fuck!\u201dDugu Xiao Yi continued staring at him with eyes filled with tears as she gave a small sob. \u201cYou\u2026 what did you just say?\u201d She did not hear it clearly. Jun Mo Xie spread his arms as he gritted his teeth in pain. Dugu Xiao Yi then continued sobbing.Jun Mo Xie scratched his head, shrugged his shoulders and was unable to think of any solution.In his previous life, Jun Mo Xie was a killer and did not have any romantic encounters. If there were any complications, they were usually solved by using money\u2026 Once his job was completed, he would then have nothing to do with the client, parting ways without forming any sort of relations.He has absolutely no understanding of the heart of females and no knowledge on how to pacify females. Thus, after observing Dugu Xiao Yi\u2019s cries he did not even bother to attempt at consoling her. For he had already given up in putting any effort into doing so! If you want to cry, then just continue to do so!.Crouching on the ground, he carefully checked the quality of the Meteoric Iron. The longer he inspected it, the more satisfied he felt. He then used his hands to lift it up. Even though it was only slightly larger than a basketball, it had close to a hundred and twenty kilograms. He gave two chuckles, extremely satisfied.If this block of Meteoric Iron were used to forge his flying daggers, they would be indestructible! He had found a real treasure this time, even though his method of obtaining it was rather underhanded\u2026As he was feeling intoxicated from happiness, his buttocks suddenly felt pain, as though his ass had just slammed into the Meteoric Iron. Only to hear Dugu Xiao Yi\u2019s sobbing sound as she quickly ran out, leaving a string of tears on the ground\u2026It turned out that after she had seen Jun Mo Xie completely ignore her, turning around to inspect the Meteoric Iron, Dugu Xiao Yi felt even more wrong. She fiercely kicked his ass once before running away while crying\u2026Gently touching his ass, Jun Mo Xie became annoyed. Seeing that Dugu Xiao Yi had already left, Jun Mo Xie took a deep breath and mumbled under his breath.Screw your mother, you little girl! If you ever fall into my hands, I will show you what I can do\u2026\u201dIn fact, even though the strength of Jun Mo Xie was nowhere near Dugu Xiao Yi\u2019s, in a fight to the death, Dugu Xiao Yi who had very few combat experience was no match for Jun Mo Xie!But this was also why there was a problem. In his previous life, Jun Mo Xie had only trained with two things in mind, being the fastest and most ruthless, in killing, each one of his technique was meant to kill his opponent! Even when he was training with his acquaintances!\u00a0Thus, when fighting normally, Jun Mo Xie was simply unable to fight with his full strength, making the situation not so optimistic for him.Once in his past life, some of Jun Mo Xie\u2019s martial brothers had requested him to give some pointers through a spar. He replied. \u201cDo not ask me for pointers, fighting is something I do not know how to do; killing is all I know!\u201dHow could he engage in a battle of life and death against Dugu Xiao Yi? Be it her family background or her temper, neither one was something that would allow Jun Mo Xie to kill Dugu Xiao Yi! In addition, she was well-known as the \u2018Nemesis of Debauchees\u2019, which was evidence of her extreme character. Besides, everything could have been blamed on the fact that the original Jun Mo Xie was too much of a bastard.Straightening himself, he turned towards the shopkeeper and asked. \u201cBoss, if this piece of Meteoric Iron is to be handed to your shop for weapon forging, how many times can you refine it?\u201dThe old shopkeeper contemplated momentarily before replying. \u201cMy humble shop had once had the opportunity to work with this type of Meteoric Iron. After getting rid of the impurity, my shop could continue tempering up to three times. The finished product had traces of circling wind clouds upon its surface, discharging a chilling aura. If utilized in making a sword, then the sword would be extremely sharp!\u201d\u201cWas it able to cut iron like butter?\u201d Jun Mo Xie asked.\u201cNo!\u201d The old shopkeeper gave a slight smirk as he simply answered.Cutting through iron like butter? This little brat has been listening to too many legends.\u201cIf that is the case, why do you even bother calling yourself the Divine Weapons Store? What kind of divine weapons will be unable to cut through iron like butter?\u201d Jun Mo Xie stared at him with a gaze that gave off a feeling of being cheated.The old shopkeeper suddenly felt the urge to turn upwards to shout the words \u2018Injustice!\u2019.\u201cYoung Master, I am afraid there has been a misunderstanding. The so-called cutting through iron like butter\u2026 that only occurs in divine weapons in the legends. Besides, even if a weapon is a genuine Divine Weapon, only a capable wielder would be able to do it. As for a divine weapon that can is able to do so even when wielded by an average person; there is none in the whole world.\u201d\u201cOh? Your words are quite logical!\u201d Jun Mo Xie suddenly recalled the phrase, \u2018when true mastery is attained, even a blade of grass could become a sword.\u2019 He could not help but shake his head.What utter nonsense! If i have such a mastery of the weapon, why would I even bother to get a sharp sword? I want a sharp sword because my level of strength had yet to reach a satisfactory level.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cNever mind then, I will think of something else,\u201d Jun Mo Xie sighed. \u201cPlease send these materials to the Jun Residence.\u201dIt turned out this one was from the Jun Family! No wonder he was so prodigal! The old shopkeeper easily promised as he wiped his sweat, but rejoicing in his heart. Even though this Young Master was a prodigal debauchee, at least all of his demands were reasonable.Since you want to handle it yourself, that would be for the best. Only, what a pity! Pity for this Meteoric Iron. As for that legendary divine weapon, there is none in this world! Asking me to forge out something like that would kill me!Watching Jun Mo Xie\u2019s back as he left, the old shopkeeper heart gave a slanderous thought.Do you want to forge a sword with just you, this debauchee? If you can truly forge one out, this senior will use my legs to walk. I will instead crawl everywhere I go!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Don\u2019t think that the Jun Family didn\u2019t have any carriages because of this. In fact, the Jun Family had relatively luxurious carriages. However, Jun Xie preferred walking with his two legs. As an assassin in his past life, he could only feel true safety when he walked with his own feet. If he took a carriage or a boat, he would feel as though his fate wasn\u2019t within his own hands. Jun Xie could not simply overlook such an uncomfortable feeling.It was a habit of Jun Xie\u2019s. His fate should rest in his own hands!The bodyguards assigned by Grandpa Jun were sent away as well. Jun Xie knew very well that those bodyguards assigned to him were just for show. Regardless of where Jun Xie went, there would most definitely be someone secretly following him. And that someone was the \u2018real deal\u2019. Jun Xie had never seen that person before and his current\u00a0level of cultivation was inadequate to locate the person. Yet, he was able to feel the person\u2019s presence ever since Grandpa Jun assigned him follow Jun Xie.This awareness was unique to top assassins. Although there was no reason for Jun Xie to believe that he was stalked, Jun XIe was confident about his judgement! Right now, Jun Xie was extremely interested in his stalker. Although his current strength is incomparable to that of his past life, his spiritual sense had far exceeded that of his past life by leaps and bounds! He tried to get rid of his stalker several times with his own counter-tracking techniques. However, his stalker still remained like Jun Xie\u2019s very own shadow. It was rare for such a person to exist.From an external perspective, Jun Xie seemed to be wandering around aimlessly. In actuality,\u00a0he had his spiritual senses spread out, with his every action coordinated with intent, similar to that of flowing quicksilver extending to all corners. Also, although Jun Xie was not moving fast, any potential stalkers would realise that every move and direction Jun Xie took was unpredictable. If an average Joe was tailing him, he would have already lost sight of Jun Xie\u2019s shadow.And yet, the one tailing Jun Xie had never been shaken off, not even once! To be honest, the stalker already lamented bitterly to the Heavens countless of\u00a0times in his heart! He agreed immediately when Grandpa Jun requested him to protect Jun Xie unnoticed. How difficult was it to protect a debauchee who spent his time idling? He was confident that Jun Xie would never notice his presence even if he were to tail him for the rest of his life given his skills and experiences.After two days, who would have known that this high-level tracker would end up feeling heavily inebriated? The brat\u2019s actions were completely illogical. When he concluded that Jun Xie was heading east, Jun Xie would change directions suddenly. When he managed to locate Jun Xie, rationalising that Jun Xie was heading west, he would then find out that Jun Xie had gone towards the south instead\u2026This person was considered to be at the pinnacle of the tracking profession. However, in just two days, he managed to make several mistakes when tracking Jun Xie\u2019s movements. He would have lost Jun Xie a long time ago if not for the fact that Jun Xie has a low level of cultivation! After committing successive mistakes, he became so pessimistic that he was on the verge of insanity; that he plucked put several strands of his beard!Several times, he just felt the desire to jump out and grab the brat\u2019s collar and asked: \u2018You son of a bitch! Why did you go through the East Gate and get out from the West Gate of this establishment? What were you thinking, wandering here and there? Could you just behave yourself?\u2019Could it be possible that the debauchee brat noticed me? He dismissed the thought almost immediately as he observed Jun Xie\u2019s wanton demeanor, it is obvious that the brat was not capable in noticing me! The only possible explanation for his actions is because he simply has no idea what he wants to do!As he pondered, he realised that Jun Xie increased his pace and walked towards a rouge watercolour shop. He could not help but exclaimed in his heart. It was expected of a debauchee to barge into a place meant for women. Startlingly, Jun Xie did not come out after a period of time. Being impatient, he went to the vicinity and stole a glance at the shop and noticed that Jun Xie was no longer inside. He became depressed: \u2018The brat left the shop using the back door. How could I be so dumb? How could I not have anticipated this?\u2019He rushed, like the winds, towards the back door in search of Jun Xie.Jun Xie finally determined that the tracker\u2019s aura had fully disappeared after gaining a considerable distance away from him. Thereafter, he slowly sneaked out of the rouge watercolour shop. He bowed courteously and thanked the people in the shop and backtracked his way and marched off.The ladies in the shop were flabbergasted as they stared at him with their eyes wide opened; \u2018That Young Master looked handsome and healthy, why would he have a sudden stomach ache just after entering the shop? Also, he occupied the toilet for such a long time, that we were almost unable to hold our bladders anymore\u2026\u2019As the sun began to set, the sky became dark. As the shadow of the night opened its grim jaws, the evening\u2019s atmosphere was left to worry. Waiting for the last traces of light to fade so that it may swallow the whole world!Before backtracking and turning into another path, Jun Xie walked for a bit. Thereafter, he turned towards the rogue watercolour shop\u2019s backdoor and continued walking in that direction. He laughed with a sense of victory in his heart: \u2018It seemed that I have sent him on a wild goose chase today.\u2019 The senior was very accomplished in jungle hunting. It would be really weird if I could not even handle a \u2018wooden club\u2019 like you. Young brat, you are way too inexperienced to go up against me\u2026The person went to chase after Jun Xie as expected and he could not find traces of Jun Xie. Immediately, he realised he was tricked so like a gust of wind he returned to the shop. Before standing in front of the rouge watercolour shop, he searched high and low in all directions. He observed the people coming in and out as his face turned green and red. It was as if he was opening a dye shop. He felt helpless!His tracking techniques had dominated the world for decades as it had never failed before. And yet, today he lost to an inexperienced young brat. Also, the brat was an incompetent and ignorant debauchee! This was the biggest joke in the world! He cried out in his heart: \u2018I have completely lost my pride this time!\u2019How shameful! What an unexpected situation!What kind of grandchild did you nurture Jun Zhan Tian? How could he be so heretical?Jun Xie chuckled as he was very pleased, He preferred to be left alone although he knew that the stalker had no malice intention against him. It was unspeakably distasteful to have someone tailing him around like a ghost. In brief, he felt uncomfortable! Now he finally felt relaxed as he had gotten rid of his stalker.As Jun Xie was walking, his body suddenly became stiff for a moment. Thereafter, hr relaxed his body, his shoulders quivered once and a flying dagger slipped down into his palm.Some of the chilling aura of darkness and coolness come together in all directions. Their goal is nothing more than Xie Jun is currently traveling the street.This aura is one he has encountered before, he is very familiar!Assassin!A cold feeling of darkness converged from various directions were brought by a few chilling aura. Their target was none other than the street Jun Xie was on. In his past life, he encountered an aura like this before, he was very familiar with it! Assassins!\u2018Seriously? I just gotten rid of the one who was sent to protect me only to end up being an assassination target right after? Wouldn\u2019t this become a joke if I really ended up killed here?\u2019 Jun Xie laughed bitterly in his heart. Yet, a long absent feeling of excitement rose from the depths of his heart: \u2018Secretly brought the scent of blood \u2013 Finally, I will be able to see my fellow peers in this world. I hope you would not make me\u2026disappointed!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWhen a group of people approached, the sound of neat footsteps was heard. There was a sedan chair in the middle of these people. The sedan chair was clear yellow in colour with pearls hanging on the sides. A golden bell hung blow the string of pearls. The bell swayed gently and made a crisp ringling sound. Listening to that ring would make anyone feel happy.This was the Royal Court\u2019s Princess Ling Meng\u2019s imperial sedan chair!Could it be that the assassins\u2019 target was Princess Ling Meng and not me?Jun Xie pondered and felt that this possibility was high. As it was just a spur of the moment for him to enter this street. There were far more suitable places before, if these assassins wanted to assassinate him. There was no reason for the assassins to not take any actions and continued to follow him!However, what kind of people would have be so courageous to assassinate Princess Ling Meng in the open when she was still close the the Imperial Palace?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Just imagine how furious and saddened the Emperor would be if Princess Ling Meng were to be assassinated?Were these people actually capable of withstanding the anger of His Majesty, the Emperor?Jun Xie did not have enough time to consider anything else as Princess Ling Meng\u2019s entourage arrived before him. The two waiting ladies in front had expressions of extreme disgust as they saw Jun Mo Xie standing before them motionless. They then walk lightly towards the sedan chair and whispered a few words into it.The entourage stopped when the person within the sedan chair said a few words. Thereafter, the sedan chair curtains were opened. Through the window, a beautiful face of a young lady in pale yellow palace clothing was revealed. The face showed some impatience that was restrained as she asked: \u2018Jun Mo Xie, why are you blocking my way today?\u2019Blocking your way? Jun Xie was stunned. He then looked around and noticed that he was standing right in the middle of the street. It was absurd for such a big entourage to make a detour for his sake! Then again, this was the princess\u2019s entourage. It was right to say that he was blocking the princess\u2019 way!Jun Xie only knows of Princess Ling Meng\u2019s existence but had never seen her in person according to Jun Mo Xie\u2019s memories. Today, he could not help but applause after seeing her for the first time. It was no wonder that Jun Mo Xie found the princess unforgettable, She was a beauty from the Heavens, perhaps the most beautiful woman from this generation.Tender white complexion, arched eyebrows, eyes like the clear surface of autumn waters, an oval-shaped face, flowing black hair, her entire body exuded a holy and noble aura. She seemed to exists beyond the realm of mortals. Fresh and refined to that of a lotus flower, free of imperfections.\u201cYour Highness, where are you going?\u201d At that time, Jun Xie realised that he was in front of the Imperial Palace. Princess Ling Meng had just left the Imperial Palace only to be embellished by assassins.What does this suggest? There is something wrong!After realising the situation, Jun Xie felt an immediate urge to move his legs and run away as far as possible. With the Jun Family\u2019s current state, it would be foolish to interfere with the royal family\u2019s internal strife.\u00a0However, judging Princess Ling Meng\u2019s protective detail, their ability to keep her alive is insufficient.It seemed that this incredible beauty was about to die in the hands of assassins. Although Jun Xie found it unfortunate, he was not reluctant. Ultimately, protecting himself and his family was the priority.\u201cOh, I am going to find Xiao Yi at the Dugu residence. Third Young Master Jun, please make way for me.\u201d Princess Ling Meng replied with a calm face. Actually, after being duped by Jun Xie into losing the Meteoric Iron, Dugu Xiao Yi became increasingly frustrated as she kept recalling the incident. Feeling wronged, she decided to find her good sister in a rush to lament. Unfortunately, Princess Ling Meng was with the Empress in the sleeping chambers of the palace. Therefore, Dugu Xiao Yi was unable to see her.When Princess Ling Meng returned, she became worried when she found out that her dear sister came over and left crying. Afraid that something bad had happened, she quickly arranged to leave for the Dugu Residence to find out what had happened. What made her unruly, yet adorable and intelligent little sister sad? Who could have guessed that the culprit was right in front of her: \u2018Jun Mo Xie\u2019.Obviously, Princess Ling Meng was unaware. Or else, she would have this bastard tied up and sent to the Dugu Residence.Jun Xie was confused. He could not feel any commanding and dominating aura of a noble from her. On the contrary, he felt a peaceful atmosphere. It was unusual for such a gentle atmosphere to exude from a royal princess.\u201cUnderstood. Mo Xie shall not disturb Your Highness anymore, please go ahead.\u201d Jun Xie thought that it would be beneficial to move aside and have one less problem. However, he decided to warn her. He gazed profoundly at her and spoke in a deep voice, \u201cBe careful along the way!\u201dActually, Jun Xie was puzzled by another greater mystery. For a princess of a kingdom, especially one that is favoured more than others, why is her protective escort so small? Moreover, there was no expert in the\u00a0detail at all! It had to be at this moment when her level of protection was at its weakest that an assassination attempt was about to take place.Where on Earth would there be such a coincidence? The more he pondered, the more Jun Xie felt that there was a huge conspiracy behind this situation!A gentleman does not stand under a crumbling wall, an exceptional assassin would flee far away. Jun Xie was not sympathetic nor cherishes beauty.\u00a0Not to mention, he would be risking his own life for this. He firmly rejects such a deal. Considering that this woman is disgusted by him. No matter how beautiful she may be, even if she is a celestial beauty so what?Princess Ling Meng was somewhat surprised as she glanced at Jun Mo Xie. As she recalled whenever Third Young Master Jun saw her, he would stalk and annoy her by calling \u201colder sister, younger sister\u201d. It was rare for him to speak in such an accommodating manner today. However, it could be considered a good thing as his actions allowed both sides to maintain their reputation.The princess returned to her seat and the curtain was put down, Looking at her now, one would see a beautiful silhouette, a fleeting dreamlike existence.Within the shadows, someone spoke urgently: \u201cBoss, the Jun Family\u2019s debauchee brat, Jun Mo Xie, appeared suddenly. What should we do now? Do we wait for him to leave or\u2026?\u201dA masked man concealing himself on the roof with his eyes shimmering with a golden light: \u201cPerfect! Do not miss this opportunity to finish him off as well! We\u2019ll let that old Jun Zhan Tian go mad as well! This is great.\u2019\u201cUnderstood!\u201dJun Xie moves to a side and murmured to himself: \u201cEven if one is an aromatic stunning beauty, they will still decay after death. Eventually, all that remains is a pile of bones, just another layer of the soil below. Jun Xie ah Jun Xie, do not be soft-hearted, standing out would only bring unwanted attention to yourself. Finally, Jun Xie shook his head and began to leave the dangerous place.At this moment, several chilling aurae locked onto Jun Xie!My God! Right now he could not leave even if he wanted to. Jun Xie could feel the killing intent directing at him becoming thicker, how could he have not known that they have already included him as a target?Could I really provoke everyone that I meet? What an unpredictable disaster! Is this what people considered collateral damage? I am just a passerby!Thereafter, an order, \u201craise the sedan chair\u201d. The entourage began to move forward slowly. The bodyguards at the front were extremely courteous as they bowed towards Jun Xie before moving off.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAt this moment, Princess Ling Meng pondered upon Jun Xie\u2019s last words: \u201cBe careful along the way!\u201d This sentence was a little nondescript. Suddenly, she felt a chill down her spine. Could it be that Jun Mo Xie knew something? Could he be giving me a subtle warning? The chill grew as she thought about it. Suddenly, she gave the order to stop so that she may ask Jun Mo Xie about this.Then, the sky turned dark instantly, the dark infinite shade of the night enveloped the ground!Following the oncoming darkness, dozens of masked men in black clothing liken to huge crows descended from the skies. Even before they reached the ground, numerous sharp blades shot straight towards the sedan chair. The blades emitted golden and silver radiance as they whizzed through the air.Screams could be heard in successions as the black-clothed men descended upon the bodyguards. Several bodyguards reacted by shouting in unison: \u201cProtect the Princess!\u201d All of them stood defensively around the sedan chair with their swords gleaming in the air, The never-ending sounds of clashing swords caused the commoners on the street to scream and run for their lives.Two other masked men in black descended from the roof and headed straight for Jun Xie. Judging the colour of their bodies\u2019 Xuan Qi, they were both Silver levelled Xuan Qi experts! The current Jun Xie is unable to defeat them especially considering that they were assassins!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You hold me in such high regards!\u00a0Jun Xie laughed bitterly. To send such experts to deal with a mere debauchee, it seemed that the person organising the assassination was generous!There were a total of nine highly capable Xuan Qi experts namely two Gold and seven Silver levelled experts. For these experts to attack the Princess\u2019 defenceless entourage without any experts was simply as easy as breaking an egg with a stone.Two swords shone with silver brilliance stabbed forward! The two pair of eyes behind the masks were bloodthirsty and cruel, their strike was meant to kill with one blow.Two counter these two attacks, a variety of methods can be used to deal with them flashed in Jun Xie\u2019s mind. However, no matter what method he decided to use would expose his true strength.What gave the Emperor assurance was the current state of the Jun Family. The declination of the Jun Family, Jun Wu Yi paralysed from the waist down; Jun Mo Xie an incapable debauchee, signified that there was no successor in the Jun Family. This suggests that the aged Jun Zhan Tian would not have any secret ambition! Therefore, the Emperor was willing to leave the entire military in the hands of Jun Zhan Tian. But if His Majesty were to find out that Jun Mo Xie was actually a dragon amongst men, the Emperor\u2019s trust would turn into an enormous suspicion! Since Jun Zhan Tian\u2019s position within the military was simply too terrifying!His Majesty would be forced to take action against the Jun Family if Jun Xie were to reveal his prowess before the bodyguards of the princess.Therefore, he could not!Immediately, Jun Xie made a decision.Jun Xie retreated in a confused manner with an extremely bewildered face. Suddenly, he tumbles backwards as his feet seemed to have tripped over something. Seemingly unintentional, this manoeuvre allowed one of the incoming swords to just graze his scalp. Meanwhile, he channelled the Art of Unlocking Heaven\u2019s Fortune to protect his internal organs and then forcefully twisted his body, causing the other sword to pierce sideways into his chest!The wound looked serious, in actual fact, it failed to even hurt his bones. The Art of Unlocking Heaven\u2019s Fortune circulated through his entire body. THe thick white mist charged into all his limbs and meridians as it quickly restored his body immediately\u2026Meanwhile, the other assassin gave two flying kicks at Jun Xie. Two \u2018peng\u2019 sounds were heard as both kicks landed on Jun Xie\u2019s chest. This caused him to groan and cough out a mouthful of blood. Jun Xie fell to the ground with his face facing the sky, then he rolled over causing his white robes to be stained with blood. After rolling, he laid there with his face grounded showing no signs of breathing nor movements.The two assassins glanced at the motionless Jun Xie, then they rushed towards the besieged sedan chair of Princess Ling Meng.They thought of Jun Mo Xie, the most renowned debauchee playboy in the capital, could not have any chance of surviving a sword attack through the chest together with the two all-out kicks from a Silver levelled Xuan Qi expert. Right now, all of his internal organs should have been crushed, leaving him with no hope of survival. Therefore, neither one of the two men had any interest in giving him another glance.Both men did not notice that when the two kicks landed on Jun Xie\u2019s body, a strange pulse burst out from Jun Xie\u2019s chest before he fell to the ground. When the two kicks landed, his chest area had six pulses burst, dispelling most of the force from the kicks.Princess Ling Meng\u2019s bodyguards today were the most common amongst the palace guards. Only the two leaders were comparatively stronger than the rest, with Silver levelled Xuan. They became flustered when they had to deal with attacks from two Gold and seven silver levelled experts under these unprepared circumstances. Although the bodyguards outnumbered the assassins, they were of little use.Interestingly, the sedan chair did not move nor make any sound since the black swords struck it. It was unknown if Princess Ling Meng was still alive.The bodyguards standing before the sedan chair fell, one after the other. The two masked men in black leading the charge leapt through the air as one with their body radiating a golden glow as they glided through the air like an eagle about to snatch up a rabbit, heading towards the sedan chair.The bodyguards became alarmed and shouted loudly. They rushed desperately forward without any regards for their own lives,\u00a0hoping to stop them with their lives. Unfortunately, their opponents were two Gold levelled Xuan Qi experts. How could they stop them with their humble level of cultivation? The gap in strength between them was far too huge and the bodyguards were pushed back to the left and right, like a sea being split in half. Four hands lashed out with a brilliant gold, its brilliance burst out in a flash. The magnificent roof of the ornate sedan chair was torn apart with strips of its colourful adorning cloth dancing in the air, Under the night sky and the golden light, this scene was simply remarkable, beautiful and sorrowful!The black swords that were fired into the sedan chair suddenly emerged like a poisonous dragon when a black glint flashed, shooting out towards the two men who were still hovering in the air.With the flash of swords, the \u2018ka\u2019 sounds were heard as the black projectiles were cut down. In this instance, a slim figure emerged from the strips of adorning cloth. The figure wrapped in a glittering silver radiance moving in haste with grace. In Princess Ling Men\u2019s eyes, anger and unwillingness were shown. Her hands were equipped with short swords glowing with a bright silver luminance, which she used to stab the two men in black.This princess who looked like a weak and slender woman was actually a Silver levelled Xuan Qi expert! Surprisingly, the young princess had a high level of martial talent. In terms of cultivation, she was similar to the other martial prodigy Dugu Xiao Yi!The two men in black snorted as they unleashed their sword attacks. Two \u2018peng\u2019 sounds were heard before the three of them fell down towards different directions. Princess Ling Meng fell to the ground, momentarily her beautiful face turned bright red before turning pale. It was obvious that she suffered internal injuries! Regardless of her talents, she is still a beginner Silver levelled Xuan user. Even if two Gold levelled Xuan Qi experts had exhausted their strength, a sneak attack by Princess Ling Meng would still end up with her at a bitter loss!The intrinsic difference in quality existed between the Silver and Gold levels. They are not comparable!After enduring the recoil, the two masked men in black charged forth again. With a step upon the ground, they caused a \u2018hong\u2019 sound and two indentations appeared as they shot forward, treading through a pace of thirty feet. Their long swords illuminated with a golden glitter as they flew towards Princess Ling Meng\u2019s tender body mercilessly!Princess Ling Meng suffered a considerable amount of internal injury from the fight before. She had no chance of regaining her composure, With no other alternatives, she squeezed out every last ounce of strength she had to dodge backwards but was still unable to dodge the incoming swords. Also, when she tried to force out all the strength she could muster, the Xuan Qi within her body became chaotic and going completely beyond her control. It all came together in a random manner that caused pain comparable to having a sword skewered through her. This caused her to have no more strength within her body. Suddenly, she could not help but fall into despair: \u2018Could this be how I would die?\u2019 A mournful look of confusion floated upon her beautiful face as she stood there quietly, watching the two swords lunging towards her without even trying to dodge anymore!She no longer had the strength to dodge!A Silver levelled Xuan Qi beginner going against a Gold levelled Xuan Qi expert and in this case \u2013 two! Even if she was not injured or possessed superb dodging skills all would be still in vain!The swords had closed in on her to the point that Princess Ling Meng could see the cruel expressions of delight within the eyes of the two men in black. It appeared that those two felt very satisfied to have the opportunity to kill such a divine beauty.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYour Highness!\u201d Several bodyguards howled loudly as they rushed out disregarding their lives. Unfortunately, it was too late\u2026Was it truly too late?Their assignment was completed as long as they killed this beautiful woman! Naturally, they would be able to enjoy an unfathomable amount of wealth and status! All was needed was for their swords to thrust forward a little more and everything would be over! Even if she was the daughter of the ruler of Tianxiang Kingdom, even if she was a rare martial talent, she would be left without a single breath in her body!Both men in black were well trained first class assassins. As Gold levelled Xuan Qi experts, their hearts were black and poisonous; killing was an act they do without emotions. However, the current target was a princess which caused them to reveal a look of ecstasy from their eyes.Right now, everyone was focused on Princess Ling Meng. Therefore, no one realised that Jun Xie who everyone thought to be dead on the ground made a slight movement. A flash shot forth from his fingers, moving up towards the sky. After flying for five feet, it made a one hundred and eighty-degree turn emitting a dazzling blue radiance as it whistled towards the space between Princess Ling Meng and the assassins.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He feigned collapsing but he was actually concentrating every ounce of his skill on to his chest. The buildup of energy caused his outer and inner robes to protrude outwards, which formed two delicate layers of protection over his chest. When the assassin directed a heavy blow on Jun Xie\u2019s chest, the pulsing outer robe acted as a shock absorber and absorbed most of the momentum. Some of the resultant momenta from the kick was also dissipated by the pulsing inner robe.As a result, the momentum of the kick that got through the outer and inner robe was only less than one-third of the original kick. This tiny fraction of force only managed to leave a minor impact on Jun Xie. However, the present Jun Xie had a hard time enduring both a sword wound and two kicks. Therefore, Jun Xie simultaneously channeled the Art of Heaven\u2019s Fortune, along with the protection, to aid in his defense. The Art of Heaven\u2019s Fortune congregated all the blood from his injuries into a single pool of blood which he spewed out. Although the amount seemed terrifying, it was in fact, inconsequential.The Art of Heaven\u2019s Fortune was able to mask the sword wound and made it appear like a flesh wound. However, the two kicks directed by the assassin on Jun Xie\u2019s chest caused him a significant amount of pain.If these assassins had delayed their mission to deal with Princess Ling Meng until after Jun Xie had left, or if they had omitted Jun Xie in their assassination mission, Jun Xie would have been able to leave calmly. Princess Ling Meng was, to a certain extent, Jun Mo Xie\u2019s dream lover, but not Jun Xie\u2019s. Hence, Jun Xie would have no qualms at all by disregarding her. In order for heroes to properly guard the beauties against harm, they must first be well-equipped with strength. It turned out that strength was just what the Third Young Master Jun was currently lacking!Even with that, the assassins still decided to target Jun Xie, which infuriated the Evil Monarch. The probability of something similar happening again in future meant that Jun Xie would not condone what they just did!I have never failed to deal with those who have hurt me or those who intend to hurt me! Since you intend to execute me, be careful and watch your back! I may not have the ability to annihilate you now, but you can be certain that this would definitely happen next time! Although this brings me no benefit, but believe me, I would not hesitate to do it! Mused the injured Jun Xie.As a result, Jun Xie did not leave when he was supposed to. Upon noticing the plight that Princess Ling Meng was in, he mimicked the qi of a Sky Xuan expert by utilizing his unlocked meridians. His flying dagger was then submerged in the qi before he hurled it out.Just as the two assassins were about to raise their swords to kill Princess Ling Meng, an uneasy feeling washed over them. A dazzling brilliant radiance of blue lighted up around them, forcing everyone to scrunch up their eyes.Dark blue!Out of nowhere, a small flying dagger appeared and intersected the path of the two swords that was heading towards Princess Ling Meng\u2019s body!The small flying dagger gave the impression that the entire dark blue night had come along with it. The ominous color resulted in an ominous feeling to wash over everyone!Yet, the azure radiance that came with it was absolutely sensational!This\u2026Sky Xuan expert!The two assassins let out a terrified wail, and their expression turned into that of pure horror. Their mission of killing Princess Ling Meng was completely forgotten and they hurriedly withdrew their swords before backing off hastily. The two assassins looked like they had just seen a deadly viper!The strength of the flying dagger was something they could not simply ignore!No doubt, both assassins were like two adults attacking a child, as Princess Ling Meng only had the power of Silver Xuan. However, in the presence of a Sky Xuan expert, a Gold Xuan expert seemed only like a baby at best, or more so an ant!Within Tian Xiang Empire, there were only a few Sky Xuan experts, so how could one appear out of nowhere, especially at such a vital moment?Even though the flying dagger was saturated with the azure color, there appeared to be no strength that came with it. The flying dagger had fallen lightly to the ground and had intersected the space between the two assassins and Princess Ling Meng. It resembled a willow branch as it swayed gently. The azure radiance remained intact, and the original color was restored after some time!The people present at the scene were astounded and they immediately came to a standstill. They were all fixated on the small flying dagger that was embedded in the ground, and their expression was that of bewilderment!They had just witnessed the small flying dagger transforming into an invincible trench! The flying dagger was still saturated with the deep blue color, long after it was hurled out! Based on what had happened, the level of skill of the Sky Xuan expert is, no doubt, at the apex! This level is close to that of the Spirit Xuan!Moreover, the flying dagger was hurled out inaudibly, as if it does not contain any strength. However, the extreme precision of its trajectory proved otherwise. It showed that the flying dagger served to deter instead of to kill! This established that the Sky Xuan expert was not in the least bit worried and that he did not view any of the assassins as a threat at all. It was evident that the expert could have killed all of the assassins if he had chosen to, should they attempt to harm Princess Ling Meng! It was not an exaggeration to say that the expert could kill these assassins with just a flicker of his finger.Those that were present at the scene were all extremely proficient individuals who possessed a tremendous amount of experience. How did the stealthy intentions of this expert escape their watchful eyes? Just as the two assassin leaders were about to stab Princess Ling Meng, a figure that was clad in blue appeared. An ocean-blue glow radiated around him. He had previously hidden in the dark shadows of a nearby house and was about to jump into action when he noticed the flying dagger. Instantaneously, he froze, and shock filled every part of his body.The eyes of this figure shone light blue, which signified the color of someone that was at the bottom of the Sky Xuan rank. Although he could be viewed as someone powerful, he was still inferior to the person that had hurled out the flying dagger.Underneath the masks of each of the nine assassins were an expression of complete fear and slight dilemma. Although they were trained assassins, each of them still treasured their own lives. If they had a slim chance of winning, they would not hesitate to fight it out. However, they were now faced with an impossible task with no chance of winning; they would certainly lose their lives. There was no choice but to retreat!On the other hand, Princess Ling Meng\u2019s bodyguards could now relax and they became extremely happy! Princess Ling Meng had a legendary person protecting her which mean that Her Highness\u2019 safety was guaranteed! In the event that the Princess was assassinated, and the assassins did not harm the bodyguards, the bodyguards would still suffer the wrath of the Emperor. Even the bodyguards\u2019 family may not be spared.When Princess Ling Meng opened her eyes, she saw the events that had taken place around her. She noticed the flying dagger embedded in the ground and felt a wave of gratitude washed over her. Without the ominous dagger, she would have been killed!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWho is the senior that is present? Do you have any information? Show yourself please,\u201d said the leader of the assassin in a courteous voice. His hands were cupped respectfully towards the sky and he stood tall and straight. The leader was attempting to act innocent by pretending he did not comprehend what the expert was doing. If the Princess saw through his act, his mission to assassinate the Princess would fail and it would be over for the assassins. Hence, his only way out now is to act dumb!If the Sky Xuan expert truly intended to protect the Princess, their mission would have no chance of succeeding, even if they were to fight till they die! Their only hope then would be to retreat!Despite the fact that Princess Ling Meng was the princess of the kingdom and the favorite daughter of the Emperor, how could she qualify as someone who has the most powerful Sky Xuan expert as a bodyguard? Only the Emperor of Tian Xiang Empire is entitled to have this expert as the bodyguard!The street remained deathly silent.Obviously, this secretive Sky Xuan expert would not reveal his identity so easily to these insignificant people.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was clear that the assassination attempt had been discovered.A few heartbeat passed, and a menacing glint appeared in the eyes of the leader of the assassins. He brandished the sword again and bolted towards Princess Ling Meng!\u00a0Since no one is willing to talk, I will continue to carry out my mission. If you choose to intercept my mission, then we will back off immediately! If not, Princess Ling Meng will die! Our mission would thus be fulfilled!Yet, as the assassin approached the flying dagger, he took extreme caution to avoid it. No one is certain what kind of strange temper the Sky Xuan expert might have. Coming into contact with the dagger might even evoke a catastrophe!Out of nowhere, a deep blue color materialized in the air and sent a glowing deep blue dagger straight into the leader of the assassin! This time, the speed of the flying dagger was significantly faster than that of the previous. It was obvious that the mysterious Sky Xuan expert was annoyed by how the Gold Xuan assassin did not catch his intentions!Like before, the second flying dagger embedded itself on the ground, next to the first dagger. It was as small and as ethereal as the previous. The dagger quivered in its position, giving the impression that it was like a fragile artwork that could be destroyed upon touching it. It even looked like it could be whisked away by just a small gust of wind. However, from the point of view of the nine assassins, the two flying daggers were like a huge mountain that stood between them and Princess Ling Meng!A formidable and invincible mountain!Attempting to cross it would be equivalent to committing suicide!Presently, the only way to kill Princess Ling Meng once and for all would be to first kill the person who had hurled out the flying daggers! Yet, this person is\u2026 the most powerful Sky Xuan expert! Should the nine assassins decide to join forces together, this task would still be impossible. The expert could still easily execute them by just lifting his hand.At that moment, the Sky Xuan expert that was hiding in the shadows of a neighboring house had begun to activate all of his spiritual awareness. Squeezing his eyes shut, he concentrated every ounce of his power in an attempt to detect the most powerful figure that was present. As he scoured, he was confident that any movements the powerful Sky Xuan expert made, or even a beginner Spirit Xuan expert, would be made known to him.Yet\u2026The search resulted in nothing. Instead, a sickening thought had just popped into the mind of the Sky Xuan\u2019s expert. His eyes widened in dismal and he started to break out in cold sweat \u2013 evidence of how much fear the expert felt.Who was the mysterious being that is protecting Princess Ling Meng? The Sky Xuan expert pondered over this question deeply. He had long since stopped searching for the aura of the mysterious expert. He did not yield any results even though he had utilized his entire spiritual awareness! There was no trace of any Xuan Qi nor any kind of soul fluctuations in the air. The person that had hurled out the daggers had managed to control all of these fluctuations!What could this possibly mean?Under what kind of cultivation would someone be able to achieve this? In the Sky Xuan expert\u2019s opinion, he could not do this. Even a powerful Sky Xuan expert, nor a Spirit Xuan with intermediate level of skills could achieve this either!Was it possible that\u2026 this proficient expert is the most advanced Spirit Xuan expert? Isn\u2019t such an expert an invincible figure? Such a figure only appeared in myths and legends!Oh, my God!When he recalled how he, an insignificant beginner Sky Xuan expert, had attempted to locate the mighty being, the expert broke out in cold sweat yet again! His attempt to locate the mighty being might have failed, but it also meant that such a powerful figure would most definitely have located him instead! If the figure had opted to unveil his soul and attacked his spiritual awareness, his mind would have been pulverized easily! If that were to happen, he would have been a gone case!Dread, anxiety, horror. When was the last time he felt these emotions?However, at that moment\u2026The Sky Xuan expert was overcome with fear. He was also grateful for the powerful being for sparing him, and he silently saluted the empty air around him out of respect, as if he was saluting his ancestors. He was aware that the being could sense his actions.How was he to know that this extremely powerful Spirit Xuan person was currently slumping motionless on the ground, seemingly dead. His failure to detect any aura from the powerful being was simply because the Xuan Qi level of this being did not even reach the Silver level\u2026 it was simply too weak. Even if the expert had detected this aura, it was not even given a second thought because it was just not significant enough\u2026Sure, people may still ask why the \u2018extremely powerful Spirit Xuan expert\u2019 utilized the cultivation level of a Sky Xuan to deter the assassins. It was simply because once the Spirit Xuan rank was attained, the radiance of the Xuan Qi would be restored to its original state, which is colorless. If the person had made use of his actual abilities to hurl the daggers, the assassins would not understand the true implication of the daggers. They would have just brushed it aside. That would have been extremely unacceptable! And it would be just too demeaning for him to personally come forward to execute the few insignificant assassins! Besides, the highest possible cultivation level that had the ability to radiate color when Xuan Qi was used would be the topmost rank of Sky Xuan which would give off a dark ocean-blue glow! Even those with no cultivation of Xuan Qi would still be able to discern this!Obviously, this person is someone who is extremely compassionate, benevolent and considerate. The Sky Xuan expert contemplated these thoughts as his heart brimmed with admiration. It was not surprising that such a person could attain such a high level of proficiency. The Sky Xuan expert felt minuscule as he started to compare himself with this senior\u2019s level of cultivation and proficiency. This was someone he truly looked up to!If the \u2018extremely powerful Spirit Xuan expert\u2019 that were sprawled motionless on the ground were aware of what the Sky Xuan was thinking, he would have felt utterly ashamed and would have thought, \u201cI am not worthy of such glorious thoughts\u2026\u201dIn the street below, the leader of the assassins had a resigned expression. He pondered for a while before bellowing, \u201cSince senior does not approve of this junior\u2019s actions, this junior will leave!\u201d Moments passed, but there was still no response. Upon realizing that the Sky Xuan expert had no desire to reveal his identity, and upon hearing the thundering sound of the hooves getting louder, the leader retracted his sword and shouted, \u201cRetreat!\u201dThe nine assassins backed away simultaneously, and their golden and silver light started to radiate around them as the prepared to flee far away. However, just as they were about to leave, a menacing voice sounded out, \u201cWhat makes you think that you can leave as and when you want, especially after you have killed so many people? Do you think you can get away so easily?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAs the voice died away, a figure clad in blue suddenly appeared at the corner of the street, blocking the route of retreat of the nine assassins. The figure was shrouded in a brilliant blue, and his eyes shone as bright as light blue pearls. He was tall and lean and enveloped in the dark, he emanated a sense of loneliness around him.Solitude, desolation, and despondency\u2026 this man exudes all of the negative emotions that would make anyone depressed! Even the delicate sword held by the man seemed to emit an aura of solitude\u2026 Upon seeing him, Princess Ling Meng immediately brightened up, \u201cUncle Ye, it is really you. Meng\u2019er is so happy!Immediately, the expression of the assassin leader changed into that of suspicion and they coldly questioned, \u201cSolitary Star of the Horizon, Ye Gu Han? So it is you! Isn\u2019t the sword your weapon of choice? When did you choose to use flying daggers to mystify people?\u201d\u201cIt is of no concern as to what weapon I use as long as it is powerful enough to wipe out you imbeciles!\u201d Ye Gu Han glanced at the nine assassins briefly before turning his gaze to Princess Ling Meng. He now had a rare expression of warmth and affection. \u201cLittle Meng is being disobedient! Leaving the palace stealthily without telling anyone. Now that a dangerous situation has befallen you, are you afraid?\u201d\u201cAs long as Uncle Ye is here, Meng\u2019er will always be safe,\u201d Princess Ling Meng laughed reverently. In front of the world-renowned powerful figure of Solitary Star of the Horizon, Ye Gu Han, Princess Ling Meng did not bore any resemblance to a Royal Princess. She appeared more like a little girl who had just encountered her precious uncle. Her face was filled with utmost respect and trust for her uncle.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was a reserved man with a ruthless nature. Anyone who came across his path would always end up dead. However, there was something about him that no one would know about. He, a reclusive swordsman, was once a desirable, handsome Young Master.An even bigger secret that no one knew was that Ye Gu Han and the current Empress, Murong Xiu Xiu, were childhood sweethearts. However, due to some unknown reason, Ye Gu Han\u2019s family was dismissed from the capital, turning him into a penniless nobody. At that time, the Murong Family was an affluent and influential family; they were a force to be reckoned with. It was not surprising that they would not allow their daughter to marry someone who had no worth to his name, especially since that person only had Silver for his Xuan Qi cultivation level. The Murong Family blatantly interfered the two lovers\u2019 love life, and eventually both of them had to part ways!A despondent Ye Gu Han left, leaving behind a hysterical Murong Xiu Xiu. The extremely distressed Murong Xiu Xiu attempted to commit suicide multiple times but was always saved at the right moment. At last, news of Ye Gu Han\u2019s death reached Murong Xiu Xiu, causing her to fall into an even deeper abyss of despair. Constant pressure from her parents eventually, forced her to succumb to her family\u2019s arrangements for her to marry the Emperor. Ultimately, Murong Xiu Xiu had become the Empress of the kingdom.On the other hand, having been outcasted from the capital for ten years, Ye Gu Han had been successfully pursuing his swordsmanship and managed to advance his Xuan Qi cultivation to reach the Sky Xuan rank. He finally felt worthy enough to marry Murong Xiu Xiu and rushed back to the capitol enthusiastically. Alas, his childhood lover had already become an Empress and had bore a girl, Princess Ling Meng, that was already seven years old! As he faced his childhood lover, an indescribable feeling of pain and sorrow ripped through them. Tears could not stop flowing down their faces!Heaven\u2019s will is unpredictable; the events of the past would not run the course of the present.Heaven likes to tease the will of men; such is the decree of time.Ye Gu Han became a despondent, white-haired man overnight. His character shifted greatly, into one that is extremely merciless and vicious. However, part of his old character still remained \u2013 he could still show affection and care to Princess Ling Meng, the daughter of his former lover. The only promise he made to himself was to avoid seeing Murong Xiu Xiu again. Other than that, he would visit and play with Princess Ling Meng frequently. Only then would his frozen heart thaw.Ye Gu Han had now assigned himself as Princess Ling Meng\u2019s bodyguard! As long as someone, even if he is the Emperor, attempted to berate Princess Ling Meng, Ye Gu Han would brazenly brandish his sword! Princess Ling Meng was the only person that kept him sane, the only thing that held him back from the dark abyss of nothingness. She was the only thing that Ye Gu Han, the ruthless swordsman, cared about!Most importantly, only a select few were aware of this top royal secret. Even the people that had sent the assassins had no clue. If they had known, they would have sent more than just two Gold-level Xuan expert for the assassination mission. As a matter of fact, they would not have even carried out this assassination mission! They would have needed at least two experts with at least the Sky Xuan rank for their mission to succeed.Ye Gu Han had come to the conclusion that the mysterious powerful expert would not reveal his identity, but Ye Gu Han could not bear to let the assassins leave, especially since they had attempted to kill the Princess. Therefore, he had no choice but to reveal himself.Anyone who attempted to hurt the Princess would be killed by Ye Gu Han! There would be no amnesty!An unwavering Ye Gu Han slowly but steadily brandished his sword! The longsword writhed like a serpent, and an undulating blue color radiated from the sword. The grim Ye Gu Han bellowed, \u201cTime to die!\u201dSilence wrapped around the nine assassins: A few minutes ago, we had already enquired earnestly if senior had any instructions for us. We wanted to know what your intentions were, yet you chose to remain silent. Now that we decide to retreat, you choose to come forward and stop us. Are you being serious?Unbeknownst to them, the mysterious powerful expert and Ye Gu Han were not the same people!\u201cYe Gu Han! Actions speak louder than words! If you intend to kill us, you need to use your sword, not your mouth!\u201d The assassins were infuriated as they replayed the scene that had occurred. We are aware that you are far more powerful than us, but was it really necessary to toy with us? The assassins were extremely conscious of how they had no chance of winning, but they started to become more fearless as they began to taunt Ye Gu Han.Ye Gu Han remained as still as a statue. His expression was both frosty and intimidating. All of a sudden, he relaxed his stance and brandished his sword. The pale blue light on his sword became even colder and sparks of blue light started to emerge from it. The frigid light enveloped the area, implying that Ye Gu Han was about to do what the assassin leader told him to \u2013 use his sword to kill them.There was no point in wasting his strength on words, especially on people that were about to die!A brilliant pale blue radiance shone out from the sword. As it struck out, it gave off a dreamy feeling. Yet, underneath that feeling, there was an overwhelming tinge of anguish. Like its master, the sword exuded the exact same aura \u2013 melancholy and solitude!With a flick of his hand, Ye Gu Han struck out with his sword! A clean-cut appeared on the throat of the Silver Xuan assassin closest to him. Within seconds, a mist of blood sprayed out. The redness of the blood blended in harmony with the blue of the sword, and in the carnage, a bewitching image was painted in the sky.The sword\u2026heartache\u2026the elusive horizon\u2026loneliness\u2026As the body of the dead assassin fell, Ye Gu Han\u2019s expression still remained mournful. He approached another two assassins. Moments ago, they appeared strong and impressive, but now in the face of death, they appeared weak and pathetic!Similar to how the Silver level expert viewed those at the Ninth level and below as insignificant, the Sky Xuan expert also viewed the Silver Xuan experts in the same way. These two assassins were as minuscule as ants, in the eyes of the Sky Xuan expert!Blood spurted out from the two assassins, and Ye Gu Han was still grim-faced. He moved in a ghost-like manner amongst the blood-tainted sky, his dreamy pale blue light following him wherever he went!When Gold and Silver level experts attempt to confront Sky Xuan experts, it was as hopeless as trying to destroy a rock with eggs. Their chances of emerging victorious were zilch. Furthermore, they had attempted to go against Ye Gu Han, who was infamous for being a cold-blooded maniac. Their chances of succeeding were even lower.\u201cHurry! Disperse! Run!\u201d screamed the leader of the assassin. He was the first to desert the scene, flying up into the sky as fast as he could. The remaining five assassins desperately scattered and ran. Each of them wishing that they would not perish like how their comrades did.There was no doubt that the assassins would be killed. The only concern was: who would be able to successfully escape?Ye Gu Han let out a ferocious roar. His menacing aura reverberated with anger as he hurled out his pale blue sword. It was like a huge sapphire shooting star. Every time the pale blue light pulsed, a wretched cry could be heard. Another assassin had fallen.Moments later, four out of the six assassins left had already been killed, though their bodies have yet to descend to the ground. Only the two assassin leaders remained. Both of them held the Gold level, the highest strength compared to the other assassins. They had fled in opposite directions and Ye Gu Han was busy trying to defeat one of them. Unfortunately, even with his abilities, Ye Gu Han could only stop one leader, leaving the other free to go!On the ground, Jun Xie had his eyes slightly opened to enjoy the show. As he witnessed Ye Gu Han\u2019s superhuman might, he was overcome with fascination. Even the original Jun Xie from the previous life could not dream of defeating Ye Gu Han in an open battle! The thought allowed Jun Xie to have a greater understanding of the Xuan Qi cultivation of this world.Of course, defeating Ye Gu Han would not be possible in an open battle. However, in the case of an assassination attempt, Jun Xie could come up with an infinite number of ways in which he could murder Ye Gu Han. After all, fighting to the death in an open battle was not Jun Xie\u2019s forte!Jun Xie thought, Ye Gu Han gave out a pale blue color, which means that he is probably only a Sky Xuan beginner. Yet, his skills and power are out of this world! What would happen if he became a Sky Xuan expert at the highest rank? What about a Supreme Divine Xuan? Delight crept over Jun Xie\u2019s heart as he relished in the thoughts of an even more powerful Ye Gu Han.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOne can only be stronger if he fights against the strong! Unfortunately, Jun Xie had not strength to challenge anyone at that moment! If he had, he would not have hesitated to confront Ye Gu Han!Strength!Jun Xie\u2019s heart started to burn with desire! At that very moment, he noticed that the other assassin leader that was attempting to flee was coming in his direction. Murderous thoughts immediately jumped into Jun Xie\u2019s mind!Son of a bitch! How can you think of leaving after causing so much damage here! What makes you think you can leave so easily!? Thought Jun Xie.Slowly but steadily, a flying dagger slid down onto Jun Xie\u2019s hands. A vehement smile was plastered over his face, which was hidden beneath his body. Time to die, asshole!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He scanned his surroundings as he was escaping and noticed that the douchebag, Jun Mo Xie, had somehow shifted himself and was now facing the sky. Jun Mo Xie\u2019s eyes appeared to be slightly open too. The assassin leader was caught by surprise: Is it possible that this asshole is still alive?The assassin leader swivelled his head around and realized that Ye Gu Han was still trying to finish off the other assassin leader, which meant that Ye Gu Han had no time to attend to him. The escaping assassin leader felt bolder.Our mission to kill Princess Ling Meng was a failure. But what if we were to kill Jun Mo Xie instead? The capital would descend into chaos too, right?\u00a0The assassin leader halted his footsteps and crept up to Jun Mo Xie, ready to stab his sword into the body of the douchebag!Right at that moment, Jun Mo Xie opened his eyes and slyly whispered, \u201cI am going to f*ck your mother!\u201dAmidst the loud thundering of incoming horses\u2019 hooves, no one could hear the low whisper from Jun Mo Xie. They were at a distance too far away, several zhangs (3.04m), to pick up anything. Not only that, they were also too busy paying attention to Ye Gu Han\u2019s battle. Only the fleeing assassin leader, who was close enough, could make out Jun Mo Xie\u2019s words. Instantaneously, a huge wave of fury swept over him!Just because I was unable to deal with the Sky Xuan expert, you think you can taunt me like that? What makes you think that I cannot kill a pathetic hedonist like you?The assassin leader swooped down, his sword poised out in a vicious manner. \u201cI will take you down!\u201d he cursed.Just then, a jade blue color shot out, seemingly bringing the whole azure ocean with it. Out of nowhere, a deep blue flying dagger appeared, going straight for the assassin\u2019s throat!\u201cOMG\u2026Sky Xuan\u2026\u201d The assassin leader was stunned and his whole body was rooted to the spot. Shock, along with his initial momentum of moving downwards, caused him to lose his balance and fell. Even before the assassin leader reached the ground, the deep blue flying dagger had already penetrated deep into his throat!Even at the moment of his death, the assassin leader was still perturbed. Ye Gu Han was 30 zhangs (91.2m) away from him, so how did the flying dagger appear here? What just happened? The assassin leader\u2019s eyes bulged widely even in his death, just like a scholar in seek of knowledge\u2026The injuries that were inflicted on Jun Xie earlier on were not light and his movements were slow. Even though the sword wound was manageable, the wound from the two kicks given by the Silver level assassin was constantly throbbing with pain. As Jun Xie watched the Gold level assassin fall to his death, he realized, to his utmost horror, that the assassin was still tightly gripping onto his sword\u2026\u201cYou unrepentant bastard!! Screw you and your whole family!\u201d swore Jun Xie under his breath. With all his might, he forced his body to move away from the sword that was heading directly towards him.Splat! The corpse of the dead assassin leader dropped right smack into Jun Xie\u2019s lithe figure. Immediately, the sword in the dead assassin leader\u2019s hand slit into Jun Xie\u2019s thigh, right where there was the most flesh!If the sword had slit just slightly to the left, Jun Xie would, unwittingly, have become a eunuch within the palace\u2026\u201cShit\u2026 F*ck!\u201d The already weak Jun Xie was flattened by the heavy body of the dead assassin. He was immobile. The next thing he knew was that the sword had slit his thigh. A new wave of pain washed over him. The Young Master Jun lamented to himself: Even a dead assassin is able to use his sword to harm me! What are the odds!? Why am I so unfortunate!Unfortunately, the sword had pierced through Jun Xie\u2019s thigh and straight into the ground beneath it. Any attempt to move his thigh would aggravate the wound. Worst still, it might even damage his tendons. As a result, Jun Xie could only remain still, with the dead weight of the assassin leader pressing on to him. The image of the dead assassin piercing his sword through Jun Xie was a sight to behold!You asshole! Moaned Jun Xie, who was on the verge of tears. This is already my second time being flattened by another man in this world! At least the first time was a living man, although he was fat and nauseating. But now, I am actually being flattened by a dead man!! And I can\u2019t even move!Unluckily for Jun Xie, the face of the dead assassin leader was just directly in front of his. As Jun Xie observed, he realized that the bastard had died with his eyes open. His curiosity was piqued and he scrutinized even more carefully. In the dead assassin\u2019s eyes, there was only the expression of doubt and confusion, instead of resentment or malice.You asshole! Are you trying to tell me that you cannot find your way to the Underworld? Stop looking at me because I don\u2019t know! Cursed Jun Xie viciously.In Jun Xie\u2019s situation, most people, regardless of how courageous they are, would be trembling when there is a dead body pressing down on them. However, Jun Xie was not like most people. He was still able to converse with the dead. In other words, he was powerful!With a loud smack, Ye Gu Han disarmed the other assassin leader. With lightning speed, his blue sword struck out and poised itself at the man\u2019s throat. \u201cTell me who sent you!\u201d demanded an enraged Ye Gu Han. He had to ferret out the mastermind behind this assassination mission, to prevent it from happening again in future. He would happily protect Princess Ling Meng as long as he could, but he might not be able to be there for her forever. What would happen if a Sky Xuan expert was restraining him in the next assassination attempt?The assassin leader gazed coldly at Ye Gu Han, albeit with a hint of despair that was evident in his eyes. He suddenly let out an unexpected laughter, \u201cYe Gu Han, what makes you think that I would talk? Hahaha\u2026 I can\u2019t believe it! Who would have thought that you, the world-renowned Solitary Star of The Horizon, Ye Gu Han, would actually be so na\u00efve! And you are a dignified Sky Xuan expert too! Hahaha!\u201d As the assassin leader laughed, blood that was as dark as the night sky spewed out of his mouth. Moments later, the assassin leader had stopped breathing. His gaze was still fixed upon Ye Gu Han, and his eyes were still taunting.It turned out that the assassin leader had swallowed the poison pill hidden in his mouth as soon as he was captured!The pill was extremely vicious. It sealed the airway of the victim and caused him to vomit out blood!Ye Gu Han sighed, but he had a look of admiration on his face. He murmured, \u201cAt least you are a real man! I will not harm your body then.\u201dBy then, all the assassins had been killed and the whole area was quiet. Even though Ye Gu Han had spoken in a soft tone, Jun Xie was still able to hear his words clearly. Jun Xie wanted to laugh out loud: Utter rubbish! How can you even call him a real man? The value of a real man is actually worth so much more than that pathetic piece of shit!Would you have let him live if he had not committed suicide? Even if you did, since he is a \u2018real\u2019 man, would the chief assassin spare him? What about the mastermind behind this assassination attempt? I have come across stupid people before, but you are by far, the stupidest I have ever seen! And you are also a Sky Xuan expert! What a terrible Sky Xuan expert you are!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euContempt washed over Jun Xie: If you intend to take him alive, the most basic thing you must do is to knock out his teeth if he still has the ability to move! That is the very first thing you should do! As for the blocking of acupuncture points, disabling the inner qi and whatnot\u2026 Omg! Must I really teach you every single thing?Incompetent! This is too unprofessional! The professional assassin in Jun Xie could not take it.Amidst the ground strewn in huge pools of blood, Princess Ling Meng frowned, giving the impression that she could not stand the overpowering stench of blood. She approached Ye Gu Han and said, \u201cUncle Ye, since when were you able to master this impressive flying dagger technique? As soon as we go back, please teach me!\u201dUpon hearing the mention of flying dagger, Ye Gu Han composed himself. He faced the sky and cupped his hands respectfully, \u201cThank you senior for lending a helping hand today! Junior is extremely grateful! Princess Ling Meng is still inexperienced. If she had somehow offended senior, please spare a thought for her and ignore it. If senior have any requests, junior would certainly fulfill them as best as I could to repay senior\u2019s help!\u201dDeep down, Princess Ling Meng was like his very own daughter. She was the only person that made living worthwhile. When the mysterious expert decided to save Princess Ling Meng, it was equivalent to saving him! Of course, he did not tell anyone that it was actually he, who had been saved. Regardless, Ye Gu Han was still extremely thankful.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The words that she had spoken earlier may have offended the mysterious expert unintentionally. Luckily, the mysterious expert was understanding and had let the matter pass. If he had not, there might have been a catastrophe caused by the infuriated expert! Hence, Ye Gu Han had understood the severity of the issue and had quickly appeased the situation for Princess Ling Meng\u2019s sake!If not for the sake of Princess Ling Meng, Ye Gu Han would not have even bothered to appease the mysterious expert, given his temper.There was no sound to be heard, indicating that the mysterious and powerful Supreme Divine Xuan expert had left\u2026Ye Gu Han sighed disappointedly. He had expected this to happen. If he were the expert, who was a master from outside the kingdom, he would also not have bothered to answer a mere princess.\u201cUncle Ye, is this\u2026 what you are talking about?\u201d inquired a curious Princess Ling Meng.\u201cMeng\u2019er, you were too careless with your words. It has offended the person who had saved you. This senior is not from our kingdom, and more so, he has a cultivation level that far surpasses mine. Actually, it would be even more accurate to say that I am incapable of comparing myself to him!\u201d Ye Gu Han chastised the Princess sternly. \u201cThe flying dagger is a blessing to us all! Even I could not send out something like that.\u201d\u201cOh!\u201d cried out Princess Ling Meng, her dainty hands covering her mouth in surprise. \u201cThat was what had happened? Since Uncle Ye is already a Sky Xuan expert, does that mean that this senior has an even higher rank than you?\u201d\u201cYes, that is absolutely correct,\u201d confirmed Ye Gu Han.Princess Ling Meng composed herself before turning towards the sky and saluting it respectfully. \u201cPrincess Ling Meng is utterly grateful to senior for saving me, and for forgiving me for the offending words I said earlier. Would it be too much to ask for senior to come forth so that Ling Meng could apologize and show my sincere gratitude in person?\u201dSilence.As an expert of Sky Xuan rank or higher, why would he or she care about receiving gratitude from a mere princess? And if this expert was the most powerful Supreme Divine Xuan expert, he might not even bother to show himself even if it was to the Emperor of Tian Xiang himself. Of course, Princess Ling Meng was unaware of this, but she wanted to profess her sincere gratitude regardless of whether that expert was still around or not! She believed that every single thing Uncle Ye had told her was nothing but the truth.\u201cWhat a waste, we did not get the opportunity to meet this expert!\u201d sighed Ye Gu Han. Immediately, his expression returned to its usual aloof form and he began to move away. \u201cLittle Meng\u2019er, it is time for Uncle Ye to leave. It is better if you were to head back to the palace. The Imperial Army is coming.\u201dIn the distance, the sound of thundering hooves became louder.Princess Ling Meng looked at Ye Gu Han wistfully, \u201cWhen would Uncle Ye come back to visit Meng\u2019er?\u201dSilly girl, Uncle Ye would always be here for you, sighed Ye Gu Han. He replied, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Uncle Ye would always come by to visit Meng\u2019er. However, one of the assassins just now managed to escape, which means there may be some problems in the future. Meng\u2019er have to be obedient and stay in the palace at all times. Be very careful!\u201d\u201cThank you,\u201d whispered a very reluctant Princess Ling Meng.The sound of the horses\u2019 hooves became even louder. The army had reached the location. Ye Gu Han flew up into the air and skimmed the surroundings. Suddenly, something caught his eye and he let out an exclamation. He flew towards Jun Xie and analyzed the scene before him with his sharp eyes. He noticed that there was a small dagger inserted in the throat of the assassin and felt immensely grateful: Turns out that senior had already helped to get rid of the escaping assassin. I am truly humbled.With that, Ye Gu Han straightened his body and left. There was a flash of blue and he was gone.From the corner of the street, a strong and sturdy horse galloped towards the princess. The young military officer clad in blue on the horse had an urgent look on his face. As he saw Princess Ling Meng standing unharmed, his expression turned into that of relief. He quickly saluted and asked, \u201cPrincess, are you ok?\u201d Concern was etched in his every word.Princess Ling Meng gazed at him dazedly. She bent and picked up the two flying daggers on the ground before her. Upon closer inspection, the small flying dagger was as thin as paper, slightly curved and had beautiful engravings. Princess Ling Meng loved it immediately. She became excited as she thought: This is the very weapon that the divine master used! And he is superior to even Uncle Ye!I love this dagger!\u201cA\u2026 dagger?\u201d stammered the young military officer. \u201cBe careful princess. Don\u2019t hurt yourself when dealing with these weapons.\u201d\u201cThe senior that had hurled out these flying daggers had prevented me from being killed by those assassins! If not for him, I would have been long dead by now! Your arrival would have been too late to save me!\u201d exclaimed Princess Ling Meng. She was careful to omit out the presence of Ye Gu Han, especially to those who were unrelated to her. Princess Ling Meng glanced briefly at the military officer, her beautiful face showed fatigue and a tinge of sadness.In the past, when Princess Ling Meng left the palace, there would be an expert with at least a Jade level that would escort her. This was personally arranged by His Majesty. So why would that expert suddenly be sent out on an errand? Not only that, the several elite Gold level experts that usually accompanied her were also deployed elsewhere without any reason. Since there were no experts guarding her, it was not surprising for her to encounter the assassins as soon as she left the palace! What could all these possibly mean? It was blindingly obvious.Princess Ling Meng was remarkably smart and bright; she was fully aware of what was happening but she did not want to think about it. She was unwilling and did not dare to consider anything. The outcome would be too heartbreaking! She would not be able to bear it!If you so desperately want to claim the throne as yours, then make it your own struggle! Why must you take advantage of me in your quest for the throne? Does the throne really mean so much? Am I just nothing but a tool in your eyes? We might not have the same mother, but our father is the same! I am still your flesh and blood! Why!? Why did you have to do that? Is what they say true? That there can be no love within the Royal family?The two flying daggers that Princess Ling Meng was holding was cold to the touch, yet Princess Ling Meng felt warm and safe! The mysterious Sky Xuan expert saved her life and he still forgave her when she mistook his deeds for others. She was fascinated by how benevolent this senior was.Although Ye Gu Han was aware that the mysterious expert possessed a strength that was well above the Sky Xuan rank, Princess Ling Meng had no clue. She only knew what she saw \u2013 the radiance of a brilliant azure color that reminded her of the ocean!Saving lives without revealing his identity and leaving no trace behind. Forgiving and did not care about receiving rewards from those he saved!This is truly the character of a real master! A sense of trust towards this mysterious expert seeded itself within the dejected and frustrated Princess Ling Meng. He was like a dragon that only showed his head but not his tail! Someone who is extremely reliable. In her heart, Princess Ling Meng believed that this mysterious expert was worthy of her trust, just like her Uncle Ye.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHolding the flying dagger, Princess Ling Meng could feel herself becoming bolder.Of course, she had a powerful Sky Xuan expert and her Uncle Ye, the Solitary Star of the Horizon, as her protectors. Anyone who had these protectors would feel equally relaxed.Princess Ling Meng\u2019s thoughts snapped back to reality, and she realized that the young military officer was staring at her. She immediately became abashed, but her previous thoughts caused her to turn angry and heartbroken.This young military officer is Murong Qian Jun, the eldest son of the Murong Family in the city. He was the up-and-comer of his generation in the Murong Family, where Princess Ling Meng\u2019s mother was from. Relationship-wise, he and Princess Ling Meng were cousins. He was one of the more famous talented and handsome young men in the city. However, ever since he set eyes on Princess Ling Meng, he was smitten. He had requested to be a military leader in his family, hoping that he would meet and stay close to the princess as often as possible. It would also give him a chance to pursue Princess Ling Meng.Since Jun Mo Xie left two months ago, Murong Qian Jun had become one of the top two suitors for Princess Ling Meng. The other suitor was Li You Ran, the Grand Preceptor\u2019s grandson.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was extraordinary in every way, very handsome, and is highly capable in martial arts. He is perfect in every woman\u2019s eyes. However, in the eyes of Princess Ling Meng, he appeared extremely hypocritical. He always appeared to be \u2018in love\u2019, but she had no way of telling if this was true or not, given how she was constantly in the palace.\u00a0Is he just wearing a mask? Or is he genuinely in love? How is his character actually like?Princess Ling Meng did not even have the slightest clue for those questions.Her other suitor was Li You Ran, the first heir of the Li Residence. He was also the most gifted scholar in Tian Xian Empire. Similarly, he did not give off a good vibe to Princess Ling Meng. Li You Ran was equally attractive, well-mannered, graceful, and humble, but he rarely showed himself. Most of the ladies in the capital were obsessed with him. Such a character earned him the reputation of being the most gentleman in Tian Xiang Empire.Li You Ran always appeared calm and composed. He was always warm and graceful, never once showing impatience or tardiness. He gave the impression that everything was within his control. Yet, Princess Ling Meng did not believe that such a perfect person would exist in this world. He might actually be a horrifying and unpredictable person deep down. No one could possibly know what he was really thinking. Whenever Princess Ling Meng was around Li You Ran, she was always filled with an inexplicable amount of dread. Her gut feeling told her that the composed young man was actually an extremely dangerous person!On the other hand, there was no facade for Jun Mo Xie. He was someone who had a rough edge to him and was not afraid to show it. Although he was a scoundrel and might be unbearable, at least he was showing his true self. He committed bad acts openly without trying to hide them. Thus, there was no need to fear that he may have any sinister motives.At the thought of Jun Mo Xie, Princess Ling Meng suddenly remembered that this debauchee had been present at the scene and had even given her a warning. The warning might have been unintentional, but it was still a gesture of goodwill. However, there was a high chance that the assassins had got rid of him right from the start! At that, Princess Ling Meng quickly ordered, \u201cHurry! Find Third Young Master Jun and check if he is fine!\u201dPrincess Ling Meng could not help but feel anxious. Her life might have been spared but Jun Mo Xie might not have been so lucky. Grandpa Jun would surely fly into a fit of rage if he knew! The chaos that followed would surely be worse than if she was the one that was killed. An ominous feeling would wash over the city and her three brothers might take advantage of the ensuing pandemonium caused by the infuriated Grandpa Jun. They might even cause further chaos within the kingdom.Although she did not witness anything, Princess Ling Meng assumed that Jun Mo Xie had been killed by the assassins. After all, two of the assassins had appeared were Jun Mo Xie was, and he had already fallen to the ground. Would the assassins have left him alone if he did not die?Several bodyguards were dispatched to search for Jun Xie, but they were unable to find him. That was because he was covered by the assassin\u2019s corpse, who was lying perfectly on top of him. No one could tell that there was someone beneath the corpse. One of the bodyguards approached the princess and reported, \u201cPrincess, we are unable to find the corpse of Third Young Master Jun. Maybe his corpse stood up and ran away by itself.\u201dAs soon as she heard that, Princess Ling Meng became enraged and she nearly vomited blood! Utter nonsense! You could not find the corpse and you say that it may have stood up and run away by itself? How is that even possible?Murong Qian Jun\u2019s face was equally dark, \u201cWhat on earth do you mean?\u201dImmediately, the guard started panicking and stammered, \u201cI mean\u2026 I mean.. Third Young Master Jun\u2019s corpse is nowhere to be seen\u2026 so maybe\u2026 uh\u2026 it left? No no\u2026 I mean\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up! That\u2019s enough!\u201d bellowed Murong Qina Jun. \u201cIf there is no corpse, it means the person is not dead yet! Which means you can\u2019t even call it a corpse! You should have said that the Third Young Master Jun\u2019s BODY had disappeared! Do you understand?\u201dThe bodyguards looked away and complained unhappily to themselves: You were the one that said he was dead just now! And you still can lecture us. You\u2019re so despicable!Helpless, Princess Ling Meng said, \u201cGo and look again, carefully. If you manage to find Third Young Master Jun\u2019s\u2026 body, send it to the Jun Family immediately.\u201d Under their influence, even Princess Ling Meng herself almost blurted out the word \u2018corpse\u2019.However, a thorough search still did not bring up anything. Princess Ling Meng could only arrange for a bodyguard to report the situation to the Jun Family. Soon after the bodyguard had left on horseback, a figure clad in gray rushed towards them. It was a scrawny, withered looking old man.Murong Qian Jun brandished his sword and asked sternly, \u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cI am looking for someone,\u201d begged the scrawny old man. He was frantic and his eyes were scanning the area erratically. The anxious old man seemed not to have heard Murong Qian Jun\u2019s question.Murong Qian Jun was offended and screamed, \u201cTake him!\u201d. Bearing in mind that someone had just attempted to kill the princess, the old man\u2019s appearance was highly suspicious.The soldiers started to surround the old man and were about to rush forward to pin him down when he let out a triumphant exclamation, \u201cFinally! There you are! Haha! I dare you to run away now, you little bastard! Oh, there\u2019s a sword piercing you down huh? Do you still dare to run away now?\u201d gloated the old man.The old man rushed towards the assassin\u2019s corpse and started to pull out the sword that was keeping Jun Xie in place.\u201cHe is in the loop with the assassins! Take him down!\u201d screamed an overjoyed Murong Qian Jun. He could not believe that this old man was so stupid. All the assassins were already dead, but the old man still chose to enter the scene just to find a corpse. The whole place was currently swarming with army personnel too.Surprisingly, the old man immediately flung away the sword after pulling it out. He then casually pushed away the assassin\u2019s corpse without even looking at it. Bending down, the old man started to lift up a body covered in blood.Hastily, Princess Ling Meng restrained Murong Qian Jun and analyzed the body carefully. It was Jun Mo Xie! His whole body was soaked in blood and he looked extremely lifeless. Suddenly, his eyes flickered and Princess Ling Meng jumped back in shock: Surprisingly, this bastard is still alive!\u201cSenior, may I ask who you are?\u201d questioned Princess Ling Meng.\u201cThere is no time to chat with you, little girl. I have to hurry and take care of this person\u2019s injuries. If not, he may actually succumb to them,\u201d. In a flash, the old man appeared right before Murong Qian Jun, the injured Jun Mo Xie in his hands. Gazing straight at Murong Qian Jun, he chided, \u201cWatch your language next time, you son of a bitch!\u201d With that, the old man disappeared into thin air.Murong Qian Jun did not even have the chance to retort back before the old man disappeared. He could only fume in anger. In addition, Princess Ling Meng was next to him, which meant that he had to compose himself and maintain his graceful image. Silently, Murong Qian Jun had already cursed the old man and all of his ancestors!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cOh no! This is bad!\u201d Princess Ling Meng exclaimed. \u201cI have already sent someone to report to Senior General Jun. Now that Jun Mo Xie had been taken away, things may become even worse if the Senior General is angry!\u201dMurong Qian Jun stepped forward to comfort the princess, \u201cRelax Princess, don\u2019t worry too much. Just return to the palace. I will take care of this. I will arrange for someone to report to the Jun Family that the usele\u2026 that Jun Mo Xie is alive.\u201dRelieved, Princess Ling Meng sighed, \u201cThat is wonderful of you.\u201d She looked away and noticed that there was a flying dagger embedded in the throat of the dead assassin leader. She could not help but welped in surprise: This senior had already helped to take care of this future problem, and I was unaware of it. She approached the corpse and pulled out the dagger. Turning it over in her hands, she concluded that the dagger was the same as the other two. Princess Ling Meng could not help but wonder: This senior is truly a remarkable and extremely powerful master. When would I have the chance to meet him in person to show my gratitude?Princess Ling Meng turned back to face her bodyguards, who appeared miserable and pathetic in her eyes. She sighed: Given the events of today, how am I to go to the Dugu Residence? Ye Gu Han\u2019s advice popped into her mind, and she announced, \u201cGo back to the palace. List down the names of those who died, report it to the inner palace and make sure that their families receive a generous compensation.\u201dPrincess Ling Meng could no longer bear the gruesome sight of the carnage before her. She closed her eyes and slowly shed two drops of tears. These men were dead\u2026 all because of her!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There was an unusual sombre feeling in the atmosphere.Murong Qian Jun jumped into action and ordered the army to escort the princess. They immediately surrounded the princess, forming a human barrier around her. Murong Qian Jun himself rode behind the escort. Deep in thought, he mused: Jun Mo Xie, that bastard, seemed to be severely injured. I wonder if he will survive? It would be good if he dies. I feel like beating him up every time I see him! He looked like such a scum who deserves it! He has such a despicable character and still dares to court Princess Ling Meng? He should know his limits!With a grunt, he urged his horse forward and stared at the graceful figure of Princess Ling Meng in front of him. Once again, he was in awe of her beauty. He was completely captivated. All thoughts of sending someone to report an update to the Jun Family was completely forgotten\u2026\u2026\u201cYou again, old man. You have been following me like a ghost for the past three days already. Are you smitten by my handsome looks?\u201d smirked Jun Xie. The old man was cradling Jun Xie in his arms, like how he would cradle a baby. The old man\u2019s body was withered and bony, causing Jun Xie to feel extremely uncomfortable. He felt as if he was lying on cobblestones. Knowing that the old man was not out to harm him, Jun Xie did not bother being courteous and had a sarcastic tone to his voice.\u201cPfft! What makes you think that senior would willingly waste my time to follow a pathetic wastrel like you? You keep scuttling around randomly every day and disappearing from my sight. I don\u2019t even know how you managed to do that. But see what has happened! Serve you right! If your grandfather did not bother spending a great sum of\u2026 Wait. How did you know that I have been following you for three days?\u201dThe old man felt indignant at Jun Xie\u2019s tone of voice. Being together with this debauchee was already shameful enough. As he was about to rant on, the old man suddenly stopped in his tracks in surprise. He realized that something was wrong, very wrong: How did this bastard know that I was following him for three days? Could it be that my tracking skills have degraded so greatly? The disrespectful manner in which Jun Xie had spoken to him was forgotten.\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid! Must you ask such a simple question? Of course, I only knew because someone told me,\u201d said Jun Xie casually, after he thought about the answer. Although Jun Xie could still sense the old man\u2019s tracking skills, it was still remarkable when compared to the experience of his past life. The original Jun Mo Xie might not have been able to sense the old man\u2019s tracking skills, let alone escape from his sight.\u201cYou are the stupid one! You are such a fool. Of course, you would not notice me huh? Who was the one that told you about me? Was it the same person that taught you how to escape from my sight?\u201d demanded the old man. It was the first time his tracking skills were discovered! And the first time that someone he was tracking could escape from his sight! Jun Mo Xie had managed to shake him off his tail! This was extremely horrifying\u2026How powerful must that person be, for him to be able to do this? If he is an enemy\u2026\u201cI don\u2019t know who that person is,\u201d countered Jun Xie. \u201cI have never met him before.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 that\u2019s expected. The person must be very powerful, but do you think you are worthy enough to meet him? And since you put it this way, I assume that the same person also taught you to escape from my sight?\u201d The old man was biased against Jun Xie and had already presumed that this debauchee was too useless to be able to discover his tracking skills. Moreover, he was extremely confident that his ability to pursue people stealthily was topnotch. However, he still had to be careful. The old man was alarmed as he considered: Is it possible that a Supreme Divine Xuan is watching me? That must not be possible! Is it?The more the old man thought about it, the more panicked he became.In actual fact, the old man\u2019s abilities were exceptionally remarkable. This was why Jun Xie, the king of assassins of his generation, had taken three whole days to deal with him!\u201cYes, you are right. By the way, are you done talking already, old man? What is with all the questions? Where are you planning to bring me? You should hurry up and bring me home,\u201d said a worried Jun Xie. Silently, he was cursing the old man: Hurry and send me home so I can use the Hong Jun Pagoda to heal myself without anybody noticing! If I were to do it here, I would be exposed. What then?\u201cNonsense! You are too severely injured. I have to take care of your injuries first. By the time I send you home, you would have been dead!\u201d chided the old man. He was still unhappy with himself: How did someone else manage to counter track me given my level of expertise? If I were to head back to the Jun Residence straight away, your grandfather would hurl countless of insults in my direction!I would have to clean this bastard up before going back! If not, it would be too humiliating!Soon after, they arrived at a shabby looking house. The old man quickened his footsteps and entered the house before placing Jun Xie down. He then carefully analyzed Jun Xie\u2019s injuries from head to toe. As he analyzed, the old man became astonished!It was evident that a sword had nearly pierced straight through Jun Xie\u2019s chest, and that there were two purple bruises on his chest too \u2013 the result of two kicks aimed at him by the assassin. Considering how strong the Silver level assassins were, an attack by either one of the two assassins should have killed him immediately. Yet, Jun Xie was still very much alive, with enough energy to continue talking! However, what was even more astonishing was that he did not even have a single broken rib! Carefully, the old man sent his Xuan Qi into Jun Xie\u2019s meridians to probe his injuries. His internal organs were perfectly fine and there was not even a single internal injury! The old man was completely dumbfounded.The area in which the sword had stabbed was strangely perfect. It did not pierce anything but had simply gone through the intercostal area in the ribs! This brat is simply too lucky!\u201cYou idiot, did you, by any chance, hire those assassins? If you didn\u2019t, why would they bother taking extreme precaution when dealing with you? Based on your wounds, I highly suspect that you are conspiring with them. Did you intend to be the hero and save the damsel in distress? Were you planning to curry favor with the little princess?\u201d insisted the old man, his slanted eyes filled with suspicion.The old man\u2019s ludicrous words irked an already irritated Jun Xie. He snorted, \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous, you old man! I was so close to death and you still think I was trying to be a hero and save the damsel in distress? I am a wounded person, for goodness\u2019 sake! Why are you not moving? Hurry and bandage my thigh! Can\u2019t you see that it is still bleeding?\u201d Jun Xie was enraged. This old man was already very senior, yet he was not behaving like one. He was not attending to manners in a proper manner. Why did his grandfather choose to hire someone like this to track him?\u201cPfft! You useless bastard, I don\u2019t need you to instruct me on what to do!\u201d the old man said. \u201cYou are one lucky bastard, you know that? Don\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t die! You won\u2019t even be crippled! Everything will be ok.\u201d As he said that, the old man patted Jun Xie on his thigh.At Jun Xie\u2019s thigh, the sword had pierced through his muscles, but not his bones. As the old man patted his injured thigh, Jun Xie felt a sharp wave of pain yet again. Jun Xie hissed in pain, and beads of sweat formed on his forehead. An angry Jun Xie asked, \u201cOld man, do you happen to have a granddaughter?\u201dThe old man looked at Jun Xie suspiciously and questioned, \u201cWhy? What do you want to do?\u201d He had completely forgotten that Jun Xie had asked him to tend to his thigh first. In his opinion, the wound on the chest was more important.If you have a granddaughter, I will rape her and kill her! I will make sure you die of heartbreak, you f*cker! Cursed an infuriated Jun Xie. Have you forgotten that I am severely injured? You still dare to slap my injured thigh!\u201cOh, wouldn\u2019t it better if a woman was to do this kind of job?\u201d questioned Jun Xie, who was busy trying to smother his anger.This old man was beneath him in rank, how could he be so disrespectful!\u201cNo way!\u201d retorted the old man. \u201cYou are a pervert, and everyone in Tian Xiang Empire knows that!\u201dJun Xie was taken aback: I am not a pervert\u2026 The real pervert is Jun Mo Xie!The old man began treating Jun Xie\u2019s wounds, and slowly night fell.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBoth were lost deep in their own thoughts. Jun Xie wanted to use the Hong Jun Pagoda to heal his injuries at a faster rate but did not have the opportunity to do so. He was extremely irritated. On the other hand, the old man still could not accept the fact that he was counter tracked and noticed: Who could possibly be so powerful to do so? Who is this person exactly? Both men were too preoccupied with their thoughts to think about reporting the matter to the Jun Family.As for Murong Qian Jun, who had promised Princess Ling Meng that he would inform the Jun Family, he too had completely forgotten about the task\u2026Neither of them had remembered that Princess Ling Meng had mistakenly sent someone to report the news of Jun Mo Xie\u2019s death to the Jun Family\u2026They were oblivious that their lack of update could cause Grandfather Jun Zhan Tian to erupt in fury, which would soar all the way to the Nine Heavens and doom the entire capital!When night fell, similar to the time Princess Ling Meng encountered the assassins, the forces within the Tang Residence began to move.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Finally, he found a hint of something, which might be a vital clue. However, he was done waiting. Sending out his troops in daylight would cause a huge pandemonium, but now that night had fallen, he had gathered all of Tang Family\u2019s experts!246 men!Two of them were Earth Xuan experts with intermediate rank, four were Jade Xuan experts, 12 were Gold Xuan experts, 36 were Silver Xuan experts, and the rest had Level Nine Xuan Qi cultivation. This time around, Grandfather Tang Wan Li had gathered the forces of Tang Family from both inside and outside the city!In the short span of just one afternoon, he had managed to mobilize all 246 men, who were the strongest within the Tang Family. They were the very foundation of the Tang Family!This operation must be flawless!\u201cOur aim is the Northern City Clan for today\u2019s operation,\u201d announced Tang Wan Li sullenly. \u201cI do not want anyone from the clan to escape, especially those who hold the position of Hall Master or higher! I want them to be captured, ALIVE! Do not kill and do not be rash. Understood?\u201d\u201cUnderstood!\u201d answered the crowd in unison. They had no idea why they were going against the Northern City Clan, and they felt that it was too extreme to gather so many men just to deal with a mere Northern City Clan. However, upon seeing the grim expression on Tang Wan Li\u2019s face, none of them dared to question him!\u201cI will be the one conducting today\u2019s operation. If any of you dare to let a member of Northern City Clan escape, you will be beheaded!\u201d commanded Grandfather Tang as he slowly scanned over everyone that was present. Seeing that everyone had listened raptly to his words, he waved his hands and shouted, \u201cMove out!\u201dSilently, 246 men clad in black from head to toe headed out into the night. Grandfather Tang strode towards the door, his coat rippling in the night wind. He was old but was still strong. Every step of his exuded strength and confidence; his unyielding determination to win tonight\u2019s operation was apparent.\u201cWait! I\u2026 I want to go too!\u201d huffed a figure in black who had just rushed out from the inner courtyard. This figure looked like a human-sized black meatball \u2013 Tang Yuan. Even though Tang Yuan\u2019s figure is extremely unsuitable for any kind of operation, he still wanted to join in the fun. However, he was too round to find any suitable black clothing, which was why he had simply wrapped himself in black cloth before rushing out.\u201cRoll back to your room!\u201d commanded a furious Grandfather Tang, as he watched the human meatball roll towards him. Grandfather Tang kicked out his leg swiftly, and all 400 plus jin (241 kg) of Tang Yuan shot back towards his room, breaking the door of the room in the process. As he rolled, the black cloth on Tang Yuan\u2019s body tore open, and his white buttocks and thighs could be seen. When he stopped moving, he was resting on his stomach, and his hands and legs were waving desperately in the air, similar to a tortoise that had fallen upside down. With nothing to leverage himself off the ground, Tang Yuan could only roll around, till he managed to push himself up by grabbing the door. With a sigh, he looked, disheartened, at the black and empty courtyard, not a soul in sight\u2026\u2026In the darkness of the night, a grand residence could be seen. Within it lay the leadership of the Northern City Clan.Grandfather Tang\u2019s beard fluttered about as he arranged his men. There were more than a hundred high level experts present, and the huge residence was getting cramped. Everyone was silent as they waited for Grandfather Tang to instruct them.The other hundred men had separated into four groups, according to Grandfather Tang\u2019s command. Each of the group was assigned to cover the four doorways of the Northern City Clan, their subordinates, casinos, brothels and other locations that were connected to the Northern City Clan. Even the houses of all the leadership of Northern City Clan were covered!Grandfather Tang\u2019s intention was to block off all possible routes of escape by the Northern City Clan and slowly force them inwards. They would then be surrounded from all sides and no one would be able to escape! Finally, the leadership of Northern City Clan would be wiped out last! With more than a hundred powerful experts surrounding the residence, the people would be trapped inside with no chance of escape.Anyone who managed to flee would be captured!Moreover, Grandfather Tang could use this tactic to better understand the attitude of Northern City Clan. If Northern City Clan did not fight back and submit themselves to his mercy, that meant that they had nothing to do with the theft incidence at Tang Residence. Even if they knew something about it, it would likely be unimportant. However, if Northern City Clan acted aggressively to his attacks, and were desperate to escape, it meant that they were connected to the theft incidence.Yet, even at that moment, Grandfather Tang was still skeptical of the information that Tang Yuan had provided: This clue, found by the infamous debauchees Jun Mo Xie, and Tang Yuan\u2026 is just not credible enough! No one else would believe it!Sadly, I have only myself to blame, for taking things too far. But I am really desperate right now! Sigh, I will just think of this operation as helping the commoners get rid of some nuisance in the world. However, if I were to find out that this is all because of those two douchebags trying to get even with each other\u2026 I will capture both Jun Mo Xie and Tang Yuan, and let them feel my wrath! Even Jun Zhan Tian cannot stop me! I will pummel Jun Mo Xie until he turns fat, and pummel Tang Yuan until he turns thin! Let their body be disfigured, for all I care!Grandfather Tang\u2019s face was extremely black and he gritted his teeth in silent fury.As he watched the alley before him, sacks of tied up captives started to increase by the number. Grandfather Tang heaved in annoyance. He had already made up his mind to return home and teach the two douchebags a lesson: They have become too daring for their own good! The residence had been surrounded by half an hour already. Every single person that had tried to escape had been caught. Their inner Qi was sealed, their limbs were bound together, and they were gagged. The number of captives was rather significant, yet they remained meek and passive. Hence, Grandfather Tang believed that Northern City Clan was innocent; they had no connection with the theft of the Xuan Core.That is no surprise. After all, what can this Northern City Clan actually do? Do they even have the guts to disturb the tiger whiskers of my Tang Family?The experts from the Tang Family started to return, carrying fewer and fewer captives. The raid against the outskirts of Northern City Clan was done!Grandfather Tang felt defeated. His face was twitching with annoyance as he cursed to himself: Tang Yuan! Jun Mo Xie! You two bastards! Senior will never forgive you! Both of you dare to coerce with each other and trick me into looking like a fool? I swear\u2026Grandfather Tang was not able to finish his thoughts because right at that moment, numerous silhouettes leaped out from behind the residential walls of the Northern City Clan. Each of them brandished their projectiles and fired. A torrential rain of projectiles begun to descend upon the experts from the Tang Family. Simultaneously, a war cry could be heard from behind the walls, and people started charging out from every single door of the residence! They were like an exploding grenade!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThey had the balls to initiate war without stating their motive! They did not even intend to negotiate with Grandfather Tang! Not only that, all of them were running away as if their lives depended on it. It seemed like they were wishing that they were born with more than two legs so they could run even faster.What does this mean?Oh my god! This was such an intense reaction! Were they acting any differently from rebels? Grandfather Tang\u2019s eyes were bulging in disbelief. The extreme turn of events had caused him to be overcome with shock for a moment. Grandfather Tang slapped his own thigh forcefully. The pain caused him to snap to attention. He was excited: There is going to be a show!Exclamations of shock could be heard amongst the members of the ambush team from the Tang Family. The sudden change in scenario had all taken them by surprise. In addition, most of them were only at the Ninth Xuan Qi Level, which meant that they were still rather weak. Most of them had been hit by the projectiles and the injuries were not light. The uninjured men of the Tang Family scattered and lunged towards the members of Northern City Clan that were dashing out. The clanging of swords connecting from both sides rang throughout the night. Brilliant colors of purple, black, silver and gold lighted up the entire area, painting a spectacular scene.It was as if the firing of the projectiles and the rushing out to fight by the Northern City Clan members had occurred simultaneously.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His previous bleak expression had now changed into an excited one, and his hands were quivering agitatedly. A calm person for almost half his life, Grandfather Tang almost lost his composure and burst out: Holy shit! They are actually involved in the theft! I must have hit the jackpot! Grandfather Tang\u2019s eyes were gleaning.That son of a bitch! How am I to know that Tang Yuan could actually contribute something for once? Who was the one that mentioned that a blind cat cannot come across a dead rat? I will make sure to reward him properly when I return!\u00a0As he thought, Grandfather Tang suddenly became ashamed. He flitted his eyes around as if he had just committed a crime:\u00a0Uh, I think it was wrong of me to call Tang Yuan a son of a bitch. After all, that \u2018bitch\u2019 is my daughter-in-law\u2026The aggressive reaction from Northern City Clan confirmed that they had a connection with the Tang Family\u2019s theft case. If not, why would the pathetic Northern City Clan dare to attack a Duke of the Empire and the family of the Minister of State Revenue? This family was the most powerful family in Tian Xiang Empire! Offending them was akin to trying to court their own death!One by one, members of the Northern City Clan that had rushed out were captured and tied up. Grandfather Tang cleared his throat and straightened his posture. His gaze was penetrating yet his face remained expressionless. His beard fluttered in the night wind. Grandfather Tang was like an imposing stature. An aura of power and grit exuded from him as he ordered his men to give what the captives deserved.\u201cSmack!\u201d A member of the Northern City Clan had been pummeled into midair. Before he could react, a rope had shot out and encircled his waist. It tightened and immobilized the man before he fell to the ground. A brutal punch landed on his face, causing his teeth to fell out. The man did not even have time to scream before a gag was stuffed into his mouth. He was then picked up and thrown several zhangs (3.04m) away. The entire process took place in a short span of a few seconds. As the man landed, he realized that he was not the only one. Everyone surrounding him was his comrades, and they were tied and gagged up too\u2026\u201cSmack!\u201d Another one!\u201cSmack!\u201dAll 246 experts of the Tang Family were now involved in the fight. They were invincible as they advanced inwards. No one could escape under their watchful eyes.The Northern City Clan Leader, Qin Hu, was surrounded by three Gold level Xuan Qi experts. Regardless of which way he turned, how much he tried to fight or run, he was unable to escape. His face was etched with desperation. Nearby, an Earth Xuan expert stood watch with his hands behind his back. Qin Hu could not escape, and he could not even commit suicide! If their aim was not to capture him alive, he would have been kicked to the Underworld a long time ago. Qin Hu was feeling more desperate by the second!As the experts from the Tang Family wrapped up their thorough search of the area, they began to gather into the yard. Some of them were still searching the yard meticulously, their eyes analyzing even the smallest detail. If they suspect that there was a hidden secret passage at a certain part, they would dig for three feet to verify their suspicion.After a while, a triumphant voice called out, \u201cFound it!\u201d Grandfather Tang was overjoyed as he entered the courtyard. He noticed that the experts were dragging out several people. It was none other than Qin Xiao Bao, Qin Hu\u2019s son. Along with him were several attractive women. Qin Hu had hidden them in the clan\u2019s most secretive chamber. His intention was to keep his son safe in the event that his attempt to escape was unsuccessful. However, the experts from the Tang Family were too professional as they still managed to locate the hidden chamber. It was located merely a zhang below ground with a covert exit.Upon realizing that his son was captured, Qin Hu despaired and gave up resisting. If not for fear that Qin Hu would fight till he dies, the three experts would have long since captured him! However, at that moment, Qin Hu had lost the will to fight. The three Gold level experts surged forward simultaneously and captured Qin Hu effortlessly. \u201cSplat!\u201d Qin Hu\u2019s body crumpled to the ground. He no longer had control over his body nor his life.Success!Slowly, Grandfather Tang approached Qin Hu. Looking down at Qin Hu\u2019s dejected face, he waved his hands in a shoo-ing motion. The surrounding men backed away immediately, giving both of them some privacy.\u201cWhere is the item?\u201d growled Grandfather Tang, his eyes boring straight into Qin Hu\u2019s. His question was straight to the point so that Qin Hu would not have the opportunity to deny anything!Such a question would lead Qin Hu to think that: Grandfather Tang knew that Northern City Clan was the one that had stolen the Xuan Core and that Grandfather Tang had proof of it. All that was missing was his cooperation. So long as Qin Hu had something to do with the theft of the Xuan Core, there was a 90 percent chance that his expression would give it away when he heard the question as a prisoner!Sure enough, Qin Hu inhaled sharply in shock. His mouth was agape, he was tongue-tied and there was a look of desperation in his eyes! Grandfather Tang was observing his reaction carefully and was ecstatic at the response he was seeing. Finally, the suspense in his heart was abated.It really is a jackpot! Oh, my dear Tang Yuan, you have finally managed to accomplish something! And a great accomplishment at that! Looks like there is actually some hope for you! Wait a moment, didn\u2019t this matter came from that douchebag, Jun Mo Xie? A sudden thought came into Grandfather Tang\u2019s mind: Having a bunch of debauchees together does not seem like such a bad idea after all. At least they had proven their usefulness at the critical moment. Didn\u2019t everyone say that I used to be like a debauchee too? But right now\u2026Grandfather Tang realized that his thoughts had digressed and he composed himself. Regardless of whether he found the Xuan Core today, Grandfather Tang made a mental note to thank the Jun Family. The Tang Family now owe the Jun Family a huge favor! It was time to improve their relationship with the Jun Family\u2026\u201cWh\u2026 What is this Xuan Core? I\u2026 I do not know anything about it, Tang\u2026 Senior, why would you do this to us so suddenly? I\u2026\u201d answered a very flustered Qin Hu. His eyes were flashing and he was hoping that luck would be on his side.\u201cOh, what a talkative little brat you are. You don\u2019t remember anything about a Xuan Core? Haha\u2026 Don\u2019t worry. I will make sure you remember,\u201d smirked Grandfather Tang. He waved his hand and an expert from the Tang Family brought forward Qin Xiao Bao\u2019s body. Qin Xiao Bao was thrown on the floor, and the expert left.\u201cQin Hu, it is to my knowledge that you only have this one son. I promise that as long as you tell me everything, I will make sure that your son is not harmed, no matter what happens to the Northern City Clan. I give you my word that I will protect the last remaining heir of your Qin Family and make sure he remains safe and sound,\u201d laughed Grandfather Tang in an amicable manner. \u201cUnfortunately, if you still cannot remember anything, you will have to witness your own son\u2019s suffering. When that happens, no one would have a happy ending. Do you understand?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cFather! Save me!\u201d wailed Qin Xiao Bao. Qin Xiao Bao had suffered through a very unfortunate year. At the start of the year, when he was walking the streets, he came across a beauty and could not help but catcall and flirted with her. Unfortunately, he was captured, his Dan Tian broken, and his Xuan Qi cultivation destroyed. After he recovered and he was finally able to move again, he went to a wine shop but was smacked on the face by a drunkard. Although he only cursed the drunkard, he was still beaten up and had his leg broken. As he cried his way home, he thought he would have a safe haven to nurse his injuries. Yet, something like this were to happen. He was carried and thrown around like a bag of rubbish despite his injuries. Qin Xiao Bao was currently an emotional turmoil. He was afraid, nervous, in pain, and despondent\u2026Grandfather Tang slowly stretched out his withered hand and stroked Qin Xiao Bao\u2019s neck, similar to how one would stroke a frightened puppy to try to placate it. However, everyone knew that this was just an act. If Qin Hu\u2019s answer was not what Grandfather Tang wanted, those withered hands would transform into those of the King of Hell!Qin Hu heaved a deep sigh and lowered his gaze, \u201cYou win.\u201d Grandfather Tang beamed and replied proudly, \u201cQin Hu, you are truly worthy of being a Clan Leader. You know how to settle a situation properly. I\u2019m impressed.\u201dThe sarcastic comment was like a tight slap to Qin Hu\u2019s already bruised ego. His face was red with humiliation and it was an ugly sight. After mumbling to himself, he finally forced out the words, \u201cI believe that Senior Duke is already aware that the theft was done under someone else\u2019s commands. If it wasn\u2019t, I would never have the courage to steal something from the Tang Residence. I would not want to court my own death. Even if we had wished to steal from you, we do not have the capital to\u2026 we simply cannot do it.\u201d\u201cGo on,\u201d urged an impatient Grandfather Tang.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Given how weak Qin Hu\u2019s Northern City Clan was, it was extremely unlikely for them to act presumptuously against his powerful Tang Family. In addition, at that moment, there was no way that Qin Hu would have lied about anything, as he was desperate to gain trust from them. However, if what he said was true, then there were more factors at play that he had not yet uncover.Grandfather Tang\u2019s reaction made Qin Hu felt that Grandfather Tang had decided to believe him. He felt hope blossoming within him. Even if he was killed, at least his son would be able to live. He continued earnestly, \u201cI do not know where the person who had instructed me had come from. The only thing I know is that this person has eyes and ears everywhere. He knows the layout of Senior Duke\u2019s residence and the hidden location of the treasure. Every aspect of the plan, including what time the theft should be carried out, was decided by that person. I believe that this person must surely be one of the capital\u2019s\u2026\u201d Qin Hu trailed off and a look of horror crossed his eyes. His eyes widened in fear as he screamed, \u201cSenior Duke, save me!\u201dOut of nowhere, a sharp sound rang out and a yellow radiance started to light up the night. A great pressure seemed to converge upon them from all sorts of direction. It appeared as if there were several small suns that had suddenly filled the skies, and the night sky was now illuminated completely by the earthly yellow light!Earth Xuan experts!In a flash of yellow light, like lightning, three lithe figures descended from the sky and charged towards Grandfather Tang from different directions. Each of them was masked and clad in black clothing from head to toe, only their yellow eyes visible.The experts from the Tang Family were all taken aback by surprise, but they quickly recovered and rushed forward to stop the invaders, not sparing a thought for their own lives. Unfortunately, their lower level of strength was no match for the Earth ranked Xuan Qi experts!Grandfather Tang laughed coldly, \u201cWho is this daring fool!\u201d His white beard continued to flutter about in the night as Grandfather Tang adopted a protective stance in front of Qin Hu. His entire body was glowing with an even more brilliant earthly yellow light.Obviously, the invaders wanted to silence the witness! However, Qin Hu was currently the only person that could help Grandfather Tang retrieve the Xuan Core. How could he allow the invaders to succeed? He must stop them at all costs and protect Qin Hu no matter what!Only Qin Hu could help him to find out who was the mastermind behind the theft, and if he were to find out who the mastermind was, then he could recover the Xuan Core! By retrieving the Xuan Core, his Tang Family would thus be able to build a foundation to preserve their whole family for the next hundred years!Grandfather Tang\u2019s eyes had already turned red.Hong! Hong! Hong! Tang Wan Li charged forward by himself and blocked the three experts who had the same rank as him. He attacked viciously, just like an insane tiger!For these three experts, killing the weak Qin Hu was not a problem. However, if they were to kill Grandfather Tang, it would be akin to declaring war with the entire Tian Xian Empire! No one would be able to bear the consequence or the responsibility of such an act! Hence, Grandfather Tang had nothing to fear! At that moment, he was able to hold back the three Earth Xuan experts!The three invaders and Grandfather Tang began to circle one another as they attacked. As they fought, dust rose around the four of them and everyone in the yard started to get unsettled. The two Earth Xuan experts from the Tang Family immediately joined in the fight to back up the House Master. Vicious blows flew out, but those experts from the Tang Family who were ranked below the Earth Xuan could only watch; they were too weak to interfere in the fight.\u201cBring Qin Hu to safety first!\u201d commanded Grandfather Tang.At that moment, a pale blue light shimmered and a masked man clad in white suddenly appeared. The darkness of the night caused the man that was clad in the contrasting color, white, particularly prominent. His demeanor was casual, as though he was merely taking an evening stroll, yet he was lightning quick. The blue light pulsed several times and four wretched cries were heard. The heads of four of the Hall Masters of Northern City Clan had split open, and their bodies were dropping steadily to the ground!Beginner Sky Xuan! A Sky Xuan expert!The 200 experts from the Tang Family swarmed around the white man, forming a human barrier in front of his target. However, the man did not even glance at them. The human barrier was completely ignored as the man continued to advance forward. His body floated three zhangs (9.12m) up in the air, away from the human barrier. A blue light flashed out, and Qin Xiao Bao who was lying on the ground wailed. He could only wail out that once as the area between his chest and abdomen was smashed to a pulp, leaving him dead!Grandfather Tang howled out in fury. He swiveled his body around and charged towards the man in white. The man looked at the advancing Grandfather Tang in contempt, his blue eyes dazzling brightly. His palm shot out and connected with Grandfather Tang, causing Grandfather Tang to be driven back. A rush of breath escaped Grandfather Tang and his beard quivered. With a whirl, the man used his powerful Xuan Qi to repel all the experts from the Tang Residence. Immediately, he delivered a sudden backhand strike without even checking who was behind him.It was none other than Qin Hu!A pool of blood spewed out from Qin Hu, who began moaning and crying out, \u201cHow\u2026 ruthless! Senior Duke Tang, he is the one who\u2026\u201d Before he could finish his sentence, Qin Hu suddenly wailed out in pain. He had dropped dead to the ground, with not a single piece of bone in his body left intact!\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d laughed the man in white softly before he directed, \u201cLet\u2019s move!\u201d There was a brilliant blue flash, causing everyone from the Tang Residence to stagger backward. The three Earth Xuan experts that had invaded began to head towards the wall. As the men leaped over the wall, a yellow light shone out and they were gone.However, the man in white remained standing by the wall, his white robes billowing gracefully in the wind. He cupped his hands together and announced in a civilized tone, \u201cSenior Duke Tang, I had no choice but to go against you today. You are a very noble man, and I hope you will forgive me for what I did today. Till we meet again.\u201d There was another flash of blue as the man rose to the sky and disappeared. The night sky became dark once again.Grandfather Tang clutched his chest and coughed several times. He could tell that the man had immense strength but had been going easy on him. If the man had used his full strength when he struck Grandfather Tang just now, Grandfather Tang would be seriously injured internally. Even as he realized this, Grandfather Tang was still trembling uncontrollably with pure rage!Looking at the horrific corpses of Northern City Clan Leader Qin Hu and his son, and the four Hall Masters who had their heads split open, Grandfather Tang felt his hands and feet turned to ice.My family should also have a Sky Xuan expert like this!This is so unfair! I cannot accept it!It had been hard for them to discover this major clue. Yet, at the vital moment of success, someone had suddenly come forward and wiped out this clue. Grandfather Tang had assembled the strongest 200 men from the Tang Family, but they could only stand and watch as their witness was killed! Even Grandfather Tang was subjected to a humiliating act of mercy by the enemy!This was truly too unbearable!As they watched Grandfather Tang try to get his breath back, the men from the Tang Family all lowered their heads in shame.Out of the blue, a deep, imposing, mournful pounding sound reverberated throughout the night sky! It was coming from somewhere far away. It was like the rising waves of a sea storm, the muffled sound of thunder from the edge of the world. With each beat, the sound reverberated even louder, bringing with it an ominous feeling of storms and world ending!As the pounding rang out, foreboding sense of grievance and bloodshed seemed to fly over the world. The darkness of the night was no exception; it appeared darker and heavier!Even as time passes, the thundering did not slow down. Instead, it only became louder and louder until it resonated from all directions within Tian Xiang Empire. At the start, it was a slow deep pounding, but it had grown in intensity so much that it was now an incessant rumbling, drowning the whole world with its loud clamor!This was the deafening sound that was coming from the drums of war! A prelude to the scene of carnage and bloodbath!This is an Earth splitting, Heaven moving sound! It was the spark that would ignite the fire of war!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGenerals Summoning Drum!After decades of silence, and on this very night, the highest form of command from the most powerful military family in Tian Xiang Empire had suddenly begun to rumble again!The Generals Summoning Drum only meant that war was coming. There would be mountains of corpses and a sea of blood! Thousands of cavalry and soldier would rampage the world and countless of lives would be lost! Only a small number of soldiers would remain to claim a position of power!Within the whole of Tian Xiang, every single soldier woke up from their sleep with a start, and they quickly got dressed. The bloodlust of the soldiers burnt like an undying flame!The Generals Summoning Drum belongs to Grand Marshall Jun!\u201d shouted one of the Earth Xuan experts from the Tang Family, causing everyone to become stunned.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Amidst the unexpected and sudden sound from the drums of war, he had momentarily forgotten about the humiliation and unhappiness he had felt just seconds ago. He had only one thought:\u00a0Jun Zhan Tian has gone mad! This old bastard! What is wrong with him? Why is he going mad right when his Jun Family is at its weakest?!\u201cEveryone, return to the Tang Residence now! Those who serve in the military are to return and change to your uniform as fast as possible before reporting! As for the rest, you are not allowed to even step out of the residence without my permission!\u201d commanded Grandfather Tang in a swift and decisive manner as he rolled out his orders in succession.Instantaneously, dozens of the expert saluted Grandfather Tang ceremoniously before they turned and hurried away hastily. They were moving at a speed that had exceeded the fastest speed that they could muster.As soon as the Generals Summoning Drum had sounded, it signified that the situation had reached an extremely critical point. There was no doubt that any officer that reported late would have his head chopped off! Everybody in the military knew how strict Jun Zhan Tian was. A finger was all it took for him to deal with you!Regardless of their status, whether they are royalty, generals, children from powerful families, child of a phoenix, or even the grandchild of a dragon, anyone who dared to violate his command would be killed without any mercy!The thundering sound of horses\u2019 hooves could be heard consistently, coming from all directions. Like the waters of a raging river, all of them surged towards the military field in the city center. The soldiers\u2019 armor was polished and their faces were eager as they urged their warhorses forward!\u201cDuke, what do we do with them?\u201d questioned one of the experts from the Tang Family, as he gestured towards the remaining members of the Northern City Clan.\u201cBring all of them home, and interrogate them!\u201d Grandfather Tang knew that the interrogation would not give them any results at all, but he could not help but hope.As the warhorses galloped forth, military forces within and outside the city gathered in the barracks urgently. The military trumpets were blaring loudly and every soldier was fully alert and ready. They were prepared to receive their orders once their superiors returned. Once their orders were received, they would all move out!Grandfather Jun was going mad!These words were nothing but the truth.The assassination attempt had already occurred for half an hour before Princess Ling Meng sent someone to the Jun Residence. At that moment, Grandfather Jun was happily reading in his study and he was feeling satisfied. Not only had his grandson turned over a new leaf, but also the level of strength and perseverance that he was showing far exceeds that of the Young Masters of the noble families in Tian Xiang Empire. Nobody could beat his grandson!His grandson was a beacon of hope as the Jun Family was slowly dying around him, so how could Grandfather Jun not feel elated?Right at that blissful moment, Housekeeper Old Pang gently knocked on his door. Solemnly, he entered the room and informed Grandfather Jun that Princess Ling Meng had sent someone to report something to the House Master.Grandfather Jun Zhan Tian called the man in immediately. As soon as he laid eyes on the man, he noticed the blood on him. Grandfather Jun\u2019s heart skipped a beat. The man was speaking hesitantly and was looking everywhere except at Grandfather Jun. Grandfather Jun began to feel an ominous sense of trepidation and his face turned sour. Old Pang was standing next to the man with a strange expression on him, causing Jun Zhan Tian to feel that something was very wrong\u2026After pressuring and questioning the man, the man finally sputtered out, \u201cThe Third Young Master Jun\u2019s corpse had disappeared\u2026\u201dThe sentence was short and simple, but for Jun Zhan Tian, it was like the clapping of ten thousand thunders from the Nine Heavens roaring out in unison! Jun Zhan Tian trembled uncontrollably, his face as white as sheet. The atmosphere around him was suffocating!Old Pang was shocked, but thankfully he had expected it. He immediately slapped and pinched Grandfather Jun\u2019s chest, allowing Grandfather Jun to compose himself. The bodyguard shuddered in fear as he knelt on the floor, still as a statue. It was common knowledge that the debauchee, Jun Mo Xie, was extremely treasured by Grandfather Jun. Any harm that befell him would end up bringing about a horrifying catastrophe!As Grandfather Jun composed himself, he coughed out some blood and his face turned ashen gray. His eyes were hazy and out of focus, yet his power of speech remained. His voice was sturdy as he asked in a deep voice, \u201cWhat happened, exactly? Bring me through everything slowly and do not miss out anything.\u201d His voice was low and heavy, like a huge mountain pressing down with immense force.The bodyguard was already scared stiff and his face was deathly white, but he still managed to slowly described the ordeal in detail. While he talked, Grandfather Jun\u2019s face had turned into a scowl and he remained silent. When the bodyguard was done describing, Jun Zhan Tian waved his hands weakly and said, \u201cYou can leave now.\u201dThe guard reacted as though he had just been granted amnesty and retreated trembling. He then realized that he was drenched in sweat from head to toe!In the study, Jun Zhan Tian closed his eyes and raised his head upwards. He swallowed with much difficulty, and his Adam\u2019s apple bobbed. A tear rolled down from his wrinkled eyes\u2026If Jun Xie was like the original Jun Mo Xie, who was an unbearable and disobedient debauchee, Grandfather Jun would not be in as much pain as he was now, if the same thing were to happen to the original Jun Mo Xie. Grandfather Jun had already given up on him, so if such a tragedy had befallen on the original Jun Mo Xie, so what? The Jun Family were already doomed to demise, so for it to happen earlier made no difference.However, Jun Zhan Tian had just witnessed his own grandson\u2019s incredible transformation. He had finally seen the light, a beacon of hope! He was delighted and had begun to daydream how the Jun Family could recover, but alas, this unexpected news had come and thrown Grandfather Jun into an abyss of despair!Given the situation, Grandfather Jun did not turn delirious immediately which indicated that he had a respectable amount of self-control.Mo Xie had died for the sake of warning Princess Ling Meng! This was Grandfather Jun\u2019s first inference.The assassination attempt was targeted at Princess Ling Meng and the only ones who had enough courage to attempt it would either be the three princes of the hostile forces from the other kingdoms. However, the current position of Crown Prince was vacant and the three princes were in the midst of vying against one another for the position. Under such circumstances, the other kingdoms would not want to interfere. Therefore, the most likely suspects would be the three princes! This was his second inference.Thirdly, Princess Ling Meng was supposed to be the main target of the assassination mission. However, Mo Xie had died instead of the princess! This was something that did not add up to the story. Could it be that the suspects were Mo Xie\u2019s enemies \u2013\u00a0the Li and Meng Families? Could they have hired the assassins to paint this scenario? Was the assassination attempt on the princess just a camouflage for their real target? This was Grandfather Jun\u2019s third inference.Mo Xie was merely delivering a warning, but he ended up dying while the princess who was supposedly the target of the assassination remained alive. This implied that even though Mo Xie had warned the princess, she failed to send anyone to protect him but had instead focused on protecting herself. This had caused Mo Xie to be easily killed! This was the fourth inference!The more Jun Zhan Tian pondered about it, the colder his face became and the sharper his eyes shone. Eventually, he could only see red!Why is it that my grandson, who only delivered the warning, ended up dying while the damned girl did not?I, Jun Zhan Tian, joined the army even before I was of age, and fought in hundreds and thousands of battles! I killed my way through millions of people to become a Grand Duke and contributed generously to the kingdom. Nobody could even do what I had done or been who I had become! I, Jun Zhan Tian, had three sons and three grandsons. Two sons died fighting for the country while the youngest was crippled for life.\u00a0Out of my three grandsons, two died for some unknown reason on a war campaign. Now, my only heir that I am left with, had died for the sake of the princess\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIs this how the valiant warriors in my family would end? If this is so, then what is the purpose of me living on? Since it would cease to exist no matter what, I might as well drag everyone who is trying to take down my Jun Family with me!Jun Zhan Tian began to laugh bitterly and sorrowfully. He laughed louder and louder while his face became streaked with tears. Suddenly, he sprang up violently, his eyes flashed like lightning and his vision turned blood red. He glanced coldly at the night outside his window, before he turned and walked slowly to stand before the portrait of his late wife. He stood as straight as a pencil as he gazed at the portrait for an extended period of time. His mouth was moving, as though he wanted to say something, but in the end, he chose not to. He stretched out his hand and stroked the air, as though he was trying to feel something or bid a final farewell\u2026Grandfather Jun narrowed his eyes slightly as if he was trying hard to hold back something. Abruptly, he swiveled away and brandished the sword that had hung on his walls for a long time. His white hair rippled as he strode out without glancing back!As soon as he turned away, two drops of tears fell onto the ground and shattered into a million pieces!On the wall, the portrait showed an image of a benevolent and motherly old woman with an everlasting smile. Yet, her eyes seemed to portray sadness beneath it. A gust of wind blew into the room through the window, causing the portrait to flip, implying how powerless it was\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A deafening sound from a bell could be heard resounding throughout the Jun Residence\u2019s courtyard. With that, Old Pang solemnly followed Jun Zhan Tian with a cold and decisive face.He already knew what Jun Zhan Tian intended to do next, but Old Pang had no intention to stop him. Instead, Old Pang wanted to accompany him! He had no complaints or regrets!Downstairs, a motionless wheelchair could be seen. Jun Wu Yi was seated upright on it, his sword-like eyebrows exuding a murderous aura that could be felt throughout the skies. He remained expressionless as he observed his father coming down from the stairs. Their eyes were equally determined as they both turned around without uttering a word.At this point, it was pointless to say anything.Numerous dark figures swiftly approached the courtyard from all directions, and they then stood quietly in rows of three. They gazed at Jun Zhan Tian in a calm manner. Regardless of what Jun Zhan Tian had planned to do, they would follow him at all cost\u2026 until the very end!From the darkness of the night, countless more figures materialized into the courtyard like ghosts as they assembled and awaited their orders. At this moment, all of Jun Family\u2019s hidden forces had been deployed\u2026Grandpa Jun Zhan Tian stepped forward and uttered a few words in a subdued tone. Suddenly, the men in the shadows disappeared swiftly, leaving no trace behind, just like blood being scattered across the skies. On the other hand, the whistling sound of the wind seemed to have increased in intensity\u2026Jun Zhan Tian stood quietly for a moment and took in a deep breath of the fresh night air. However, the air that he inhaled seemed to have a thick stench of blood, causing his lungs to suffocate! He swiveled around and mounted a horse. His face was cold as steel, and his red cape that appeared as though it was soaked in blood, was fluttering about in the wind.The rest of the soldiers remained quiet as each of them mounted their horses and followed Grandpa Jun. Jun Wu Yi smacked his wheelchair with his hands and flew up into the air before landing on top of his horse. He flicked the reins and urged his horse forwards, following in the soldiers\u2019 footsteps.Soon after, Jun Zhan Tian situated himself on the stage of the military grounds.\u00a0Outside, the sound of forty drums could be heard getting louder and louder\u2026As the drums thundered, men hurriedly donned their military uniforms, armors, and helmets. They gathered their weapons and galloped towards the military grounds on their horses! Once they arrived at the military grounds, they dismounted and stood at attention, their bodies as straight as a spear!More and more men arrived on the grounds, but not a single word was uttered. They were all looking attentively at Jun Zhan Tian who was seated on the chair of the Grand Marshall, their eyes blazing fanatically!Old Marshall! It has been too long\u2026 too long since we have heard the thundering sound of the Generals Summoning Drum! The raging fires of a hundred battles\u2026 oh, how we have missed it!The pounding of the drums ceased!The numerous generals continued to stand attentively on the military grounds. On both sides of the ground, dozens of banners were flapping about in the wind, which gave off a sound that resembled that of a thousand people weeping mournfully!Jun Zhan Tian stood up and walked to the front of the stage where he asked everyone sharply, \u201cHas everyone arrived?\u201d\u201cEveryone has arrived! We are all awaiting Senior Marshall\u2019s orders!\u201d chanted the hundreds of soldiers simultaneously.\u201cVery well! Tonight, this old man will do something revolutionary!\u201d Jun Zhan Tian\u2019s sharp eyes were murderous.\u201cAll captains, listen up!\u201d\u201cHere!\u201d\u201cChen Zhou Nan!\u201d\u201cHere!\u201d\u201cYou are to gather your troops and guard the West Gate! No one is allowed to leave the city without my orders! If there is a riot, send out your men to deal with it!\u201d commanded Jun Zhan Tian, with a heavy emphasis on \u201cno one\u201d.\u201cYes, sir!\u201d\u201cJun Nian Feng!\u201d\u201cHere!\u201d\u201cYou are in charge of the East Gate!\u201d\u201cYes, sir!\u201d\u201cZhan Ji Tian!\u201d\u201cHere!\u201d\u201cNorth Gate!\u201d\u201cYes, sir!\u201d\u201cChan Lin Yu!\u201d\u201cHere!\u201d\u201cSouth Gate!\u201d\u201cThe rest of you, follow me\u2026\u201dA series of commands were issued and the soldiers stepped forward to accept their order willingly before they turned and left. Not a single soldier demanded a reason for their order! All of them had served under Jun Zhan Tian before and they were the backbone of the Jun Family\u2019s military power. They would obediently obey any command from Jun Zhan Tian without a doubt!Even if it meant that they would die!This was even more true for Chen Zhou Nan, Zhan Ji Tian, Chan Lin Yu and Jun Nian Feng. They were Grandpa Jun\u2019s most capable great generals! The four of them were also wild, proud, and cold-blooded war maniacs. The only one who could command them was Jun Zhan Tian. They would carry out the order at all cost, regardless of whether it was wrong or right! The four of them were the very foundation of the Jun Family\u2019s military power!As he issued his commands to the generals one after the other, Jun Zhan Tian\u2019s eyes became colder and colder.Mo Xie, watch how grandpa is taking revenge for you! Tonight, your enemies, people who have gone against you, all of them will pay\u2026When the drums were pounding\u2026Within the palace, Yang Huai Yu, the Emperor of Tian Xiang Empire, woke up from his sleep with a start, and questioned, \u201cWhat sound is that?\u201d The Emperor, who was at the prime of his life, had once been plagued with many military issues and was now feeling an inexplicable sense of crisis at the sound of the drums! It felt as though\u2026 something earth-shattering was happening.Outside, a feminine voice could be heard saying, \u201cYour Majesty, it appears to be\u2026 the sound of war drums.\u201d\u201cWar drums?\u201d The Emperor frowned but immediately became startled. \u201cWar drums. Generals Summoning Drum!\u201d His face became as white as sheet! He scrambled out of bed and draped only a cloak over his inner clothes before striding out of the room. He paused midway and listened carefully while his heart turned heavy.Jun Zhan Tian!In just a moment, the Emperor could infer that the sound was from Jun Zhan Tian\u2019s war drums! Jun Zhan Tian\u2019s Generals Summoning Drum was the only one in the city that could sound so magnificent yet dreadful! It was also his drums that could emit a sense of power and influence that was enough to shake the entire of Tian Xian Empire to its very core!\u201cWhat happened today? What did I miss out?\u201d asked the Emperor sullenly. At that moment, no matter what he intends to do, he had to maintain calm and level-headed. Only by discovering what had happened would he then understand the reason why Jun Zhan Tian sounded his Generals Summoning Drum at this time! He would then be able to take the appropriate measures to resolve the problem.\u201cServant do not know,\u201d answered the six palace attendants in unison as they immediately went on their knees, none of them able to answer the question.\u201cGo find out!\u201d\u201cReporting to Your Majesty, servant recalls that one hour ago, Princess Ling Meng had requested to meet with Your Majesty, but did not state why.\u201d A eunuch stepped forward from behind the Emperor and answered the question daintily.\u201cLing Meng? What happened to her? Ling Meng has always been well behaved. Unless something major had happened, she would not disturb me at such a late hour! Why didn\u2019t anyone inform me? Who dared to be so presumptuous and interfere with my matters?\u201d demanded the Emperor suspiciously. He realized something was wrong.\u201c\u2026\u201d The eunuch had nothing to say, her eyes darting around furiously.\u201cQuickly summon Ling Meng here!\u201d\u201cYes, your Majesty!\u201d\u201cConcubine Meng! Get out here now!\u201d roared the Emperor furiously. A female, who was only wearing a layer of translucent cloth, appeared and knelt on the floor.\u201cTell me, why did Ling Meng look for me? Why did you stop her?\u201d The Emperor\u2019s eyes were icy cold, devoid of any warmth.\u201cThe Princess\u2026 she said that someone had tried to kill her, but I, I saw that she was unharmed and was behaving like normal, so I assumed that she was only being mischievous. In addition, Your Majesty was already fast asleep, so concubine\u2026 dared not disturb you.\u201d Concubine Meng answered fearfully.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cMy daughter was nearly assassinated and you prevented her from meeting her father, plus you had the guts to say that she was being mischievous? Hahaha\u2026 what a considerate concubine you are,\u201d remarked the Emperor in a warm tone, as if he was unaffected by everything that had happened. However, Concubine Meng who was kneeling on the ground began to shiver uncontrollably. She knew that once His Majesty used that tone of voice to speak, it meant that someone will be in deep shit!The Emperor inched closer to the concubine and whispered kindly into her ear, \u201cI know that someone like you would not have the courage to do something like this. However, whatever that your master had promised to reward you with, it would never happen. I will make sure that he would not do anything!\u201d Concubine Meng was paralyzed with fear and stared at the Emperor with terrified eyes as her body slumped onto the floor.\u201cMen, bring Concubine Meng away and sent her to the Cold Palace! No one is allowed to come into contact with her!\u201d The Emperor was calm as he declared the fate of Concubine Meng, who had once stood above thousands.\u201cImperial Father!\u201d Princess Ling Meng approached the Emperor hurriedly, her hair still slightly untidy.\u201cTake your time and tell me what had happened today. Come, talk to your father and make sure you tell me every single detail.\u201d The Emperor soothed the princess as he smiled kindly at her. It was as if nothing had happened with the concubine earlier, and the chilling coldness in his eyes had all but completely disappeared.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His Majesty\u2019s head was lowered as he listened silently, moving not even in the slightest bit.The events involved the safety of His Majesty\u2019s own daughter. Not only that, it had also embroiled another \u2018crucial\u2019 person. This person had often remained neutral to political issues, but his involvement in today\u2019s events and the consequences that would result from his involvement were simply too great. It was so great that the Emperor himself may not be able to bear it, or even want to face it!As an Emperor, his own daughter was almost assassinated. Yet, His Majesty had to care about that debauchee. Could there be no love amongst the royal bloodlines? How sorrowful!Finally\u2026\u201cFrom what you have said, Jun Mo Xie had gone to deliver a warning to you before the assassination attempt happened?\u201d pondered the Emperor.\u201cYes. Although I am not certain, I believe that Jun Mo Xie\u2019s actions are not suspicious. Perhaps he had found some clues regarding the assassination attempt,\u201d remarked Princess Ling Meng in a low but firm tone.\u201cClues\u2026 Jun Mo Xie is such a worthless person, how does he have the ability to find any clues\u2026 Never mind, these are all insignificant details. Regardless, another master appeared and saved Jun Mo Xie before taking him away. This means that Jun Mo Xie did not die, correct?\u201d questioned the Emperor as he became mysteriously profounded.\u201cThat is true, Imperial Father,\u201d confirmed Princess Ling Meng. She knew that His Majesty had intentionally avoided mentioning Ye Gu Han even though His Majesty was aware of his existence. She herself also chose not to mention his name.\u201cIf that is so\u2026 then why is Jun Zhan Tian going crazy? He even ignores the consequences of sounding the Generals Summoning Drum!\u201d pondered the Emperor. \u201cHis grandson is still alive and the Jun Family had not fallen to the point where they have no descendants. Why then, would he act this way? What he is doing is simply\u2026\u201dHis Majesty straightened his body and took two steps forward, his fingers gently tapping his forehead. He slowly continued, \u201cHis grandson is not dead, but Jun Zhan Tian went mad for no reason. Sigh\u2026 one thing is clear: Jun Mo Xie has yet to reach home. Hmm, I suppose that Jun Zhan Tian must have heard that his grandson was in danger, but Jun Mo Xie had failed to return home so he lost his mind. Hahaha, it seems like I have underestimated them. This stone\u2026 how many birds will it kill?\u201d smiled His Majesty coldly.A thought suddenly popped into Princess Ling Meng\u2019s mind and her beautiful face turned pale. If it was really what she had imagined, then the consequences that would result from this misunderstanding would be too huge for her to bear!\u201cSince Jun Mo Xie\u2019s life was no longer in danger, why didn\u2019t you send a message back to the Jun Family? Meng\u2019er, you were too careless\u2026 Meng\u2019er, did you remember something else?\u201d Noticing that Princess Ling Meng\u2019s face had turned pale, the Emperor smiled as he tried to suppress his anger. However, his eyebrows and eyes were already furrowing in fury. His daughter always had excellent manners and conduct, so why did she suddenly make this mistake today? Could it be that the assassination attempt had affected her so badly?\u201cImperial Father, before Jun Mo Xie\u2019s corpse was found\u2026 uh, I mean, during the period when we were unable to locate his body, I\u2026 I sent someone to report the news to Senior Duke Jun. It was only after the messenger had left when the old man appeared and located Jun Mo Xie before carrying him away.\u201d Princess Ling Meng stammered awkwardly as if she had difficulty speaking.\u201cThen what happened next? The message was sent, but Jun Mo Xie was found to be alive. Did you not take any action to fix the situation?\u201d The Emperor looked at his daughter disappointedly. At the same time, his heart was touched: Old man? Could it be that besides Ye Gu Han, there are others protecting my daughter too? If that is the case\u2026The Emperor contemplated the possibility while keeping his face passive.\u201cGiven how great an impact the news would have, steps would no doubt have to be taken to correct the misinformation. However, all of my bodyguards were injured at that time. Thus, I have entrusted the new information to Murong Qian Jun and requested that he send a message to Senior Duke Jun to inform him that Jun Mo Xie is still alive. If Senior Duke has yet to receive the news that Jun Mo Xie is still alive, then the only possibility is\u2026\u201d\u201cThat is not a possibility. It is obvious that Murong Qian Jun did not send any messenger to report the new information to the Jun Family. If he did, this would not\u2026\u201d the Majesty let out a heavy sigh. A murderous and savage expression quickly flickered across his face before it disappeared just as fast. \u201cI have no more questions for you, you should go and rest now.\u201d The Majesty stroked Ling Meng\u2019s hair as he said that. His hollow eyes gazed over the Imperial Palace and he suddenly felt that the bright yellow color that represented nobility was an eyesore.This assassination attempt is rather peculiar\u2026 how unexpected. His Majesty slowly deliberated when suddenly his eyes turned sharp!Sigh, I suppose it is time to \u2018wash\u2019 the palace.I wonder, will the palace be even brighter if I use human blood to wash it?Far away, the pounding sound of the war drums ceased. The entire world was replaced by a stifling ominous sense.Jun Zhan Tian, I hope you will not make things too difficult for me\u2026A complex expression appeared in the Emperor\u2019s eyes before disappearing almost instantly.As he watched his daughter walking away, the Emperor folded his arms and pondered for a moment. Suddenly, he said, \u201cShadow, go and take a look. Do not interfere unless it is absolutely necessary, and tell Jun Zhan Tian that his grandson is still alive. If he wants to throw a fit, let him be, but it must not be too extreme! Hmm, while you are at it, help me pass something to him. Sigh, the old soldier has held on to this for far too long\u2026\u201dAfter saying that, His Majesty picked up a writing instrument and scribbled something on it. Rolling up the note, he turned around and said, \u201cGo.\u201dThere was a gust of wind, and a figure that appeared imaginary materialized. The slip of paper that the Emperor was holding disappeared and a faint shadow could be seen flying out of the Imperial Palace.\u201cI will let you be presumptuous. However, in return, you must lend me your sword!\u201d whispered the Emperor menacingly, a smile spreading across his face.The Emperor had always planned meticulously. However, he had underestimated the extent of Jun Zhan Tian\u2019s fury! In addition, the message had come too late\u2026\u201cMen, send in the Great General Dugu Wu Di,\u201d commanded the Emperor with a loud sigh: I will let things remain chaotic for now. Hopefully, there will be some people who understand and choose to control themselves. As for those who do not understand, there would be no sense to keep them. Or rather, they will not be fit to stay.It is not that I do not allow you to fight. Rather, only those that emerge victoriously can be considered capable! Even if you fight, you must keep within the line! Those that cross the line will only bring about a calamity upon themselves\u2026\u2026Princess Ling Meng returned to her own bedchambers after leaving the Emperor. It was only then that she realized that her Imperial Father had only questioned her about the Jun Family. All the questions were concerning Jun Mo Xie. Not even a single question was about His Majesty\u2019s own daughter, who was the main target of the assassination attempt!Why?This assassination attempt is simply too suspicious. It had involved her, an Imperial Princess, and was possibly the sinister result of the other Princes. Was it possible that in her Imperial Father\u2019s heart, this attempt was less important as compared to the Jun Family?Or was Imperial Father avoiding something?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOr\u2026Remembering how mysterious her Imperial Father had looked, Princess Ling Meng could not help but shiver. Thankfully Uncle Ye and that mysterious expert are protecting me\u2026The distressed Princess Ling Meng reached into her bosom and retrieved the three small and exquisite flying daggers. She held them in her hands and noticed that they were only as big as her palms. They were slightly curved, as thin as a layer of onion, and beautifully crafted. Even the sum of the thickness of the three daggers was not much. Princess Ling Meng was puzzled. How could such a small flying dagger contain so much power, to the extent that it was able to force a group of murderous assassins to retreat without a fight?The flying dagger laid still in her palms, its body reflecting the light from her lamp. The reflection was a crystalline radiance, colorful and dazzling. If someone were to see it, he would assume that such a dagger was a toy that belongs to a kid from a rich family. Who could have know that this was a weapon that was used by a powerful master?I would most definitely be able to recognize this unique flying dagger, should it appear before me again! Princess Ling Meng thought contentedly to herself. Her heart was filled with a sense of longing as she thought: This absolute master is one that even Uncle Ye looks up to. What kind of person could he be?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When Dugu Wu Di was at the military barracks outside the city, he heard the sound of the war drums and quickly gathered a group of soldiers with him before riding towards the city. The first thing he did when he reached the city was to go to the Imperial Palace and request to meet the Emperor.He had already commanded his soldiers to prepare for war. If Jun Zhan Tian were to rebel, his Dugu Family\u2019s military forces would be the only ones in the city that were capable of protecting the Emperor. They were also the only ones that had the ability to go against Jun Zhan Tian\u2019s forces!However, His Majesty had adopted a secretive attitude towards this issue, causing Dugu Wu Di to become perplexed.The current situation had escalated to a very serious level. A drastic change to Tian Xiang Empire\u2019s ruling power may occur at any moment and the Imperial Palace may end up occupied. Yet the Majesty had only said four words to him: Do not be impatient! The Majesty then sent him home to find his old man. He even prevented him from returning to his barracks and even thwarted his attempt to organize the defenses for the Imperial Palace. These were simply too incomprehensible.Dugu Wu Di felt himself going dizzy.The dispirited Dugu Wu Di finally reached home. He immediately went to find his father, Dugu Zong Heng, before going to his own courtyard. However, what happened next left the great general, who was in command of hundreds of thousands of soldiers, extremely embarrassed\u2026\u201cYou PIG! Good for nothing! You dragged this senior out of his bed just for the sake of this little problem? You unfilial disobedient son! How did I manage to bring up such a worthless human being? Next time when you leave the house, don\u2019t you dare call yourself my son! I cannot afford to lose my face!\u201dGrandfather Dugu was in a rage and his voice was so loud that everyone in the residence could hear him. His spittle from his fit had landed all over his son\u2019s face as he jabbed Dugu Wu Di\u2019s head. With each jab, Dugu Wu Di\u2019s head was pushed backward. \u201cCan\u2019t you use that pig head of yours to think? Or is it filled with dog shit? Rebel? Bullshit! Let this senior enlighten you. Even if our Dugu Family were to rebel, Jun Zhan Tian would never rebel! Even if the Emperor himself rebel against himself, Jun Zhan Tian would also never rebel! Get your sorry ass back to bed and sleep! I can\u2019t be bothered with you anymore, you PIG! Stupid pig! Son of a bitch!\u201dIn the end, the great general Dugu Wu Di was kicked out. Furiously, Grandfather Dugu turned around and headed back to bed. However, a fierce voice instantly screeched out, \u201cYou old bastard! What did you say just now? Son of a bitch? Who is Wu Di\u2019s mother? If Wu Di is a pig then what kind of animal are you?! Is there only dog shit in your head? You pig! You absolute pig!\u201d The sound of a few forceful slaps could be heard.Great General Dugu Wu Di massaged his buttocks, his face sour and filled with resentment. He viciously shouted to himself: Give him a brutal beating! Serve him right!Still confused, Dugu Wu Di headed back to his own courtyard only to realize that it was filled with noise and was brightly lit. His wife and third concubine were still awake. Upon noticing his return, they hurried towards him. After some questioning, he found out that his daughter had run back home in tears and no matter what they did, she would not cheer up. She had then locked herself up in her room and did not set a single foot out of it. From the looks of it, it seemed like someone must have bullied her.The confused and glum Dugu Wu Di suddenly turned livid. Why is nothing going right today? And who in Tian Xiang Empire have the guts to bully my baby girl? You better watch out as I mobilize my army to exterminate you! Accompanied by his wives, he broke into his daughter\u2019s room and started to console her. After some time, she finally stopped crying and was able to calm down after drinking a bowl of soup.\u201cWho is the one that dares to bully my daughter? Tell me their names! I will get rid of all of them!\u201d hollered a ferocious Dugu Wu Di. His heart ached as he noticed his dear daughter had turned swollen from crying. He growled inwardly: I am going to explode!\u201cFather,\u201d said Dugu Xiao Yi. \u201cYou must get justice for me.\u201dA sense of foreboding came over Dugu Wu Di suddenly: Is it possible that my daughter was\u2026 He could not help but nervously asked, \u201cWho is it?\u201d\u201cWho can it be, other than that stinking bastard Jun Mo Xie from the Jun Family! He will be the death of me! Father, you must help your daughter exact revenge!\u201d lamented Dugu Xiao Yi in an aggrieved manner.Dugu Xiao Yi had been holding her rage in her for the whole day as she waited for her father to come home so she could complain to him. She would then ask her father to gather her brothers together to beat up Jun Mo Xie and retrieve the Meteoric Iron. She had not bothered asking her mother as it would be pointless since she would not agree.After listening to what Dugu Xiao Yi had said, Dugu Wu Di heaved a huge sigh of relief: Turns out I was worried about nothing. It is not as bad as I feared it was. I can relax now. He frowned and said, \u201cHaha my good daughter. If it was someone else, I would most certainly beat him up without any doubt. Even if it was one of the Princes, I would still give him what he deserves just for your sake. However, it is Jun Mo Xie, and that would be rather difficult considering the current situation.\u201d Of course, it would be difficult. As of now, even Jun Zhan Tian did not know where his grandson was. How would Dugu Wu Di even be able to locate him? Even if he did, he might not have the courage to lay his hands on him! That old man had really lost it this time\u2026\u201cCould it be that father is afraid of the Juns? My life is so bitter! Ugh, this will be the death of me!\u201d Dugu Xiao Yi began wailing again. She turned around and faced away from Dugu Wu Di. For some reason, she had the sudden urge to beat Jun Mo Xie up whenever she recalled his face. An inexplicable fury rose up from within her and she had an uncontrollable desire to wipe away the detestable smile off his face.\u201cSigh! That is not the case.\u201d Dugu Wu Di felt helpless as he watched his daughter cry again. He quickly attempted to explain, \u201cThe truth is, this brat\u2026 Sigh, we do not even know if he is still alive or not. We don\u2019t even know where he is. Let\u2019s wait until he is found before we deal with this matter. Father will then definitely help my dear daughter get her revenge! We will make sure that brat gets what he deserves!\u201d\u201cHuh? You don\u2019t know whether he is alive or not? What happened to him?\u201d For some mysterious reason, Dugu Xiao Yi felt a stab of pain in her heart. She swiveled around and gazed wide-eyed at her father, her eyes still filled with tears. A sense of fear welled up within her\u2026 Why am I feeling fearful?\u201cI was informed that Princess Ling Meng was nearly assassinated today. That bastard did not know his own limits and had tried to deliver a warning to the Princess. In the end, the Princess was saved but that debauchee ended up becoming the scapegoat.\u201dDugu Wu Di\u2019s face was triumphant. He was unaware of his daughter\u2019s pale face after she had heard what he said. Her small hands were clutched tightly together. Dugu Wu Di continued, \u201c\u2026 He was stabbed in his chest once, and a Silver Xuan assassin kicked his chest several times. He was then taken away by someone and we do not know where he was taken. The way I see it, that brat\u2019s life is hanging by just a thread.\u201dDugu Xiao Yi moaned lightly as she started to become petrified. She felt as though she was sinking into a void of nothingness. Her mind was a complete mess and she did not process any word that Dug Wu Di had said. Even his voice had somehow become distant and muffled\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThere is no need for you to worry! If that brat is still alive, father will catch him and bring him to you so you can personally beat his buttocks! Beat it till it rots! Hahaha\u2026\u201d Dugu Wu Di laughed gleefully. It was then that he noticed something was off in his daughter\u2019s expression. He stretched out his hands and waved it in front of her face. \u201cXiao Yi? Xiao Yi?\u201d\u201cHuh? Oh!\u201d responded a startled Dugu Xiao Yi. It was as if she had just been awakened from a dream. Her face was calm as she slowly lied down on her bed, \u201cFather, I feel tired. I want to sleep\u2026\u201d\u201cOk then, rest well. Everything will be alright when you wake up. Father needs to go drink some wine to get rid of this unpleasant feeling. Today has been horrendous\u2026\u201d Dugu Wu Di shook his head and left the room, oblivious to the fact that something was off with his daughter\u2026Dugu Xiao Yi pulled up her blanket and covered herself with it. She laid motionless as her mother and some of her concerned aunts spoke softly to her. However, Dugu Xiao Yi did not register what they were saying. Her heart was in complete chaos, as was her mind. She did not understand why she had the sudden urge to cry. A huge lump was forming in her throat and her heart was throbbing painfully. Tears flowed silently as she wept, causing her bed sheet to turn wet. She did not even notice when her mother and aunts left the room\u2026Is it possible\u2026 Is it possible that he is actually\u2026 dead? But\u2026 but I..

He left the military stage and headed towards his horse. There were a few places that he wanted to go to, where he must personally witness it burning to the ground. Only then would he be able to comfort his grandson\u2019s \u2018soul in Heaven\u2019!Suddenly, a chunk of the dark night moved and a figure that seemed even darker than the night materialized out of nowhere. Even though this figure was standing right before them, no one was able to discern the features on its face.\u201cShadow? Why are you here? Did His Majesty send you?\u201d Jun Zhan Tian raised his head and asked.\u201cThis is a gift from His Majesty,\u201d Shadow raised his hand and a piece of white paper floated towards Jun Zhan Tian. A smile seemed to appear on the blurred face and he had a peculiar and terrifying voice. The voice transformed into an invisible thread, which crept into Jun Zhan Tian\u2019s ears. \u201cHis Majesty said that your grandson should still be alive! His Majesty also wanted me to tell you this word: Moderation!\u201dThe voice of the shadow emphasized specifically on the word \u201cmoderation\u201d. His voice was hoarse and seemed to be laced with unwillingness, as though he was not accustomed to speaking so much.\u201cMo Xie is alive?\u201d Jun Zhan Tian was elated as he suddenly remembered the person he had entrusted Mo Xie with: Is it possible that he had saved my grandson? Jun Zhan Tian took a step forward and asked anxiously, \u201cShadow, is my grandson\u2019s injury severe?\u201dShadow had already turned around and was ready to leave as if he did not want to stay any longer. Even though the person before him was the most powerful general within the military forces, he was not interested in lingering any longer then he needed to. Upon hearing Jun Zhan Tian\u2019s question, he reluctantly answered, \u201cStill alive, heavily injured!\u201d Shadow shook his head as his spoke and gazed at Jun Wu Yi who was beside Jun Zhan Tian. He huffed and was gone in the next instant.The spark of hope that had started to kindle within Jun Zhan Tian was immediately extinguished as if a pot of cold water had been poured over him! Jun Zhan Tian was paralyzed with shock. Shadow seemed to be sending a message when he gazed at Jun Wu Yi like that \u2013 Even though Jun Mo Xie would not die from his injuries, his condition would not be any better than Jun Wu Yi.Jun Zhan Tian\u2019s emotionless heart had just begun to turn warm again, but was now frigid cold! Is the only heir of my Jun Family going to end up a cripple? The thought swirled continuously around Jun Zhan Tian\u2019s mind, as he became extremely enraged!If he was correct, those who would always go against his grandson were the Meng and Li Families!F*ck your grannies! I don\u2019t care if you people have anything to do with today\u2019s events! I will kill all of you! Consider today your unlucky day!Jun Zhan Tian let out a stream of expletives in his heart. He jumped up onto his horse, gritted his teeth and cried out, \u201cSoldiers, follow me! We are going on a raid!\u201d\u2026 Shadow had not intended to send that kind of \u2018message\u2019 to Grandpa Jun when he glanced at Jun Wu Yi. He had a different reason altogether in his mind\u2026The night was bound to become a bloody one!Jun Zhan Tian\u2019s furor would encase the entire empire in a torrent of blood!In the empire, warhorses were seen galloping to and fro. One by one, the residences of numerous high-ranking officials were set on fire. The sound of weapons clashing and people screaming miserably filled the air.Before Shadow had appeared, countless of men clad in black had already started to move about in the darkness. Like ghosts, they infiltrated the residences of court officials\u2026Some of the residences did not even have the chance to resist, and the officials fell helplessly before their swords, splattering blood all over\u2026The Assistant Ministers of Justice, Meng Zhi Yu and Li Qiao, are members of the Meng and Li factions respectively. They are also supporters of the Eldest Prince. Under normal circumstances, they were already very hostile towards the Jun Family. Tonight, both their families were going to suffer greatly.As the war drums boomed, several dark figures leaped into the residences of these two court officials. These men left a trail of blood behind them wherever they go, starting from the gatekeepers to the main hall and finally into their target\u2019s bedrooms. The two pitiful court officials did not even have a chance to utter a word before their heads were chopped off. Thankfully, their family members were spared. However, the residences were soon set on fire, which blazed brilliantly throughout the night\u2026One of the current Imperial Censor, Tie Yan, had always been on bad terms with Jun Zhan Tian. His son had followed Jun Zhan Tian to war but had ended up breaking military laws and was thus beheaded. The incident had caused him to be infuriated for years. Upon hearing the sound of the war drums, Tie Yan thought it was finally his chance to strike down Jun Zhan Tian. He quickly got out of bed and got dressed before starting to work on an impeachment petition. Halfway through, his window suddenly shattered and several masked men charged in. They snatched up the unfinished impeachment petition, glimpsed at it and sneered. Rolling up the petition, they brutally stuffed it down the old man\u2019s throat before proceeding to slash his neck. Even the petition was cut in half in the process!Another Imperial Censor, Zhou Meng Cheng, had taken Jun Wu Yi\u2019s position when Jun Wu Yi lost the war and ended up a cripple. Back then, he had accused Jun Wu Yi of being an inept commander, causing Jun Wu Yi to be dismissed from his military duties. When the war drums sounded, Zhou Meng Cheng was sleeping soundly with one of his concubines, having drunk some wine before he slept. The next thing he knew, he was snatched up, completely naked. His prized possession between his two legs was hacked off and he was then stabbed in the heart. The dead and naked Zhou Meng Cheng was hung on one of the great trees in his residence. His eyes, which had remained open, stared soullessly at the flames blazing through his residence\u2026Another two families, which were once part of the Jun Family\u2019s faction but had changed sides and were now part of the Second Prince\u2019s faction, felt a sense of trepidation upon hearing the Generals Summoning Drum. Qian Wan Guan and Wu Yun were acutely aware of how Jun Zhan Tian usually acts. Even though their residences were not near the city gates, they had decided wisely to leave the city immediately! They quickly gathered up some of their belongings and headed towards the city gates, planning to escape while they can and lay low. However, when they arrived at the city gates, they found themselves surrounded by an army!The officer that was leading the soldiers immediately yelled out orders to catch the assassins, signaling for the archers to let loose their barrage. He did not give anyone the chance to explain themselves! At the South Gate, more than a hundred members of the Qian Family had become \u2018porcupines\u2019 from the arrows and their faces were unrecognizable\u2026At the West Gate, almost sixty members of the Wu Family were slaughtered and their bodies had turned into a bloody pulp. The corpses were then doused with oil and set alight. The stench of burning corpses rose up to the Nine Heavens\u2026Next to the corpses of both families, a tall wooden sign which state \u201cAssassin\u2019s Retribution!\u201d was erected.Another unfortunate Imperial Censor had roused in the middle of the night to use the toilet. The next day, he was found with his bare buttocks exposed to the air while his head was shoved deep into the excrement pit. One could only guess how long he had to suffocate before he died\u2026Tonight, these officials who held high positions had turned into a flock of lambs surrounded by a horde of ravenous wolves!On this night, it seemed as if the apocalypse had descended upon the entire capital! The turbulent flames of Grandpa Jun Zhan Tian\u2019s fury completely engulfed the capital! The extent of what ensued was beyond what His Majesty had expected. When His Majesty received the report, he became so livid that he started to smash anything he could lay his hands on\u2026The Jun Family\u2019s secret forces rampaged about like a pack of barbaric ghosts. The chaos of the night and the staggering amount of bloodshed and death had shaken the prominent members of the empire. Many of them were badly hurt and everyone was scared out of their mind! Everyone had the same thought: What can they do against such a powerful force? Perhaps they should consider planning a new line of defense for their own homes.This was especially true for the three Princes. Each of them had summoned their allies and called for an emergency meeting. The mighty forces of the Jun Family had ignited sparks of jealousy in them: If only they had that kind of power\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHowever, in the midst of their meeting, their residential palace was suddenly set ablaze. Next, numerous decapitated heads were thrown inside, staining the grounds with their blood. The three Princes were petrified and immediately commanded their palace guards to investigate. However, nothing was found. In addition, their attempts to search outside were obstructed by the patrolling soldiers\u2026Of course, there were some exceptions amongst the many big families. These exceptions include the Li Family, Meng Family and Song Family who had a sturdy foundation. When the masked men clad in black started their assault, these families\u2019 experts quickly reacted to counteract the attacks. However, the fire attacks on their family continued\u2026In the secret chamber of the Li Family, several members of the family were tempted to head out after hearing the cries of the battle outside. One of them had on a white robe and was more than thirty years old. His face was cold and proud. A glance at him and one would be able to tell that he was the Sky Xuan expert that had killed Qin Hu in front of Old Master Tang Wan Li.The door of the chamber opened and Young Master Li You Ran entered.\u201cYou Ran, let me go out. Out of these all these masked men, the strongest one should only be at around the Jade Xuan level of cultivation. What is there to fear? Anyone of us here is powerful enough to stop them. I don\u2019t understand, the attacks have already reached your own doorstep yet you choose to remain indifferent about it. Since these masked men have a death wish, let us fulfill it for them!\u201d complained the white-robed man in indignation. He had always been arrogant and fearless.

Never!\u201d At this moment, Li You Ran revealed a calm smile. \u201cI\u2019d rather have the Li Residence burnt to the ground than mobilize you!\u201dHis smile contained an interesting mix of tenderness and chilling ruthlessness. \u201cAs long as our people are still alive, the Li Family will still exist, but if you are going to show yourself, what the black masked men do no longer matter. One thing I can be sure of, we will eventually attract the attention of countless eyes! Regardless of whether or not your identities are exposed, the Li Family would end up in hot soup! Also, the rumours regarding the Li Family having the Xuan Core would spread in all directions. When that happens\u2026\u201d\u201cSenior, please remain in this secret chamber for now and do not come out! Once the matter is settled, I will immediately arrange for someone to send you out of the city! If your help is required in any other matter, I will immediately inform master and the other seniors.\u201d Li You Ran laughed lightly. \u201cThis time, not only am I not going to stop him, I will send more people to them to kill! I\u2019d like to see how Old Man Jun settles this!\u201d\u201cHis sins are no different from the crime of rebellion. Even if the royal court was willing to overlook it, would the Emperor tolerate it? Li You Ran gave a rare sneer on his face.\u201cWell, if that is the case, I won\u2019t say anything else. I will accommodate your wishes. The white-robed man\u2019s face displayed dissatisfaction but he nodded helplessly. \u201cJunior, if you have the time, you should visit Master. Master has been\u2026 very worried about you.\u201d\u201cSenior, rest assured, I will.\u201d Li You Ran gave a faint smile and walked out.At this moment, there was a sudden \u201cboom\u201d sound from an exploding aerial signalling firework. The explosion created an array of colours in the sky, extremely beautiful.Following the fireworks, all the masked men in black retreated just like a receding tide. They disengaged from their battles and retreated; some leapt across the walls while others rushed out through the doors. In a twinkle of an eye, they have disappeared into the vast night\u2026 \u2026Then, the sound of thunderous hooves resounded as thousand of calvary reacted. In an orderly manner, the military cavalry units rode towards the Li Residence at high speed! In a blink of an eye, they arrived before the Grand Perceptor Li\u2019s Residence\u2019s door. A series of orders sounded, the cavalry dispersed and encircled the Li Residence.\u201cBoom\u201d the main gate was smashed open. Grandfather Jun Zhan Tian stepped inside, his body was exuding with a killing intent!His body was covered with a sky blue luminance due to him channelling the Sky Xuan qi within his body. Although the Li Family would not dare to do anything to him due to his authority, he must consider in the \u2018what if\u2019s. After all, it was better to be safe than sorry.On both sides, the two team of elite soldiers entered the compound in two rows and their swords flashed.\u201cEveryone belongs to the Li Family, get out here! Assassins have appeared within the city and I am conducting a search on the entire city!\u201d Grandpa Jun roared, his voice shook the entire residence.\u201cHa Ha Ha, turned out that Old Brother Jun had personally come. Your presence has honoured my humble abode.\u201d The Grand Preceptor Li Shang smiled and stepped out from the main hall. Step by step, he sohwed an eager demeanour of a person who had finally have been reunited with his long-lost twin.Jun Zhan Tian\u2019s face remained passive, \u201cGrand Preceptor Li, please keep your subordinates and relatives in check. Princess Ling Meng had just suffered from an assassination attempt. Therefore, I am performing my duty by searching and capturing the assassins. If anybody here gets injured by interfering with my military duties, I will not be held accountable!\u201d Thereafter, he waved his hand, \u201cSearch!\u201d\u201cHold on!\u201d Li Shang stepped forward, his white beard drifting lightly. The gentle look on his face flickered for a moment before he said in a loud voice, \u201cSenior Duke Jun, you\u2019re the Grand Marshall of the kingdom\u2019s military force; a Duke of the kingdom; a person with great authority and weight in the royal court. Yet, I am the Grand Preceptor, another great figure in the royal court and a Duke! Without His Majesty\u2019s decree, who would dare to be presumptuous within my Li Residence?\u201dJun Zhan Tian revealed traces of emotions and sneered, \u201cGrand Preceptor, are you suggesting that any high ranking official within the royal court has the right to harbour assassins in their homes? Search! Anyone who dares to obstruct, kill them without any mercy!\u201dAt this moment, hundreds of soldiers begun marching in from behind, heading towards the Li Residence\u2019s inner compound with the intent of searching. Li Shang\u2019s body trembled in anger and shouted,\u201d Jun Zhan Tian, how dare you act so brazenly, overstepping your official boundaries! Are you planning to rebel?\u201dJun Zhan Tian laughed out loudly, \u201cGrand Preceptor sure knows how to joke! This senior official is just trying to toot out the assassins who attempted to assassinate the Imperial Princess. How is my action overstepping my official boundaries? How is this considered brazen? How am I planning to rebel? Grand Preceptor, you\u2019ve been trying to stop me from searching your residence for quite some time now, Could it be that there is a connection between you and the assassins?\u201d Thereafter, Grandpa Jun Ignored him and waved his hand to signal to the soldiers to hasten their searchAt this time, a white young man stood up and smiled, it is the grandmother Li leisurely. I saw him respectfully on the war of the day a ceremony, said: \u201cIf your husband Lord Ye search impeachment, Li up and down, of course not dare to defy; but if there is no imperial edict, Jun grandfather so good at a product manager Home search wantonly; Oh, even if the gentleman husband is not afraid of shadow oblique body, but I still have to look at the face of Li, once the words came out, it seems to anyone who does not look good ?!At this moment, a white-robed young man stepped forth; it was none other than Li You Ran. He gave a ceremonious salute of respect to Jun Zhan Tian before speaking up. \u201cSince Senior Duke Jun wishes to conduct his search, we certainly wouldn\u2019t oppose you. However, without His Majesty\u2019s decree, your actions today would tantamount to a wanton act of trespassing into the home of a high ranking court official. Ha Ha, even if Senior Duke isn\u2019t afraid of the consequences, the Li Family still needs to maintain our reputation. If this matter were to spread, then both our reputation would end up being smeared!\u201dJun Zhan Tian stared coldly at the refined looking young men standing before him. He could not help but recall his grandson, Mo Xie. His grandson could have ended up being more powerful than Li You Ran if it weren\u2019t for the sinister attack! When he thought about that, his fury burst out and coldly asked, \u201cWhat are you implying?\u201d\u201cThis junior only has one simple question to ask Senior Duke Jun. Senior Duke Jun constantly reiterates that the reason for conducting the search was to find assassins in my family\u2019s residence. It doesn\u2019t matter where or how Senior Duke received the information that the Li Family was harbouring assassins. However, what will Senior Duke Jun do if you are unable to find the assassins here?\u201d Li You Ran smiled gently and took another stepped forward,\u201dShould that happen, Senior Duke Jun will need to give an explanation to the Li Family!\u201dGrandpa Jun laughed out loudly. Suddenly, he took a step forward and fiercely slapped Li You Ran in the face. A \u201cpa\u201d sound was heard, followed by a kick from Grandpa Jun to Li You Ran\u2019s stomach, Thereafter, Grandpa Jun furiously shouted, \u201cThis senior is in the process of searching for assassins! Even your grandfather Li Shang doesn\u2019t dare fart in front of me, but you? What are you? You dare start a debate and find faults with me? You want an explanation? This is my explanation!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cPooh!\u201d Jun Zhan Tian spat out. \u201cWhat a joke! If we could not find the assassins, that would suggest that the Li Family is innocent! Obviously, if we cannot capture the assassins, then we will have to resume searching! What else is there? I am more interested in asking you this. Your Li Family, from the elders to the juniors have been desperately trying to stop me from conducting my search. What are you planning? Could it be that the Li Family is planning a rebellion? Are you the mastermind behind the Imperial Princess\u2019 assassination attempt? If the assassins were to escape due to your actions of hindering my duties, does your Li Family have enough heads to bear such a responsibility?\u201dThese words were directed at Li Shang. Clearly, Grandpa Jun did not regard Li You Ran as someone with the qualification to even speak to him.Even when there is a confrontation between two military force, hierarchy must be considered. If a bunch of rookies were to be sent into the battlefield, they would only end up dead and abused. Obviously, Li You Ran understood this logic. However, he could not stand the sight of his grandpa\u2019s humiliation. Also, there were indeed some people that must not be found that was staying inside their hidden chambers. If they were to be found, that would be akin to having yellow mud smeared onto their underwear. Everyone will still think its shi*t, even if it is not. Even if the Li Family is innocent, everyone will still think that they are guilty! Left with no choice, he had to step forward and hope that Jun Zhan Tian would consider his status as the top of the military force and let this go.How could he have guessed that Jun Zhan Tian currently no longer cared about his status quo nor his reputation? A slap and a kick executed in a flash! Li You Ran may be a genius but was limited in experience. His current level of cultivation was only at the Gold Xuan, a difference of Heaven and Earth compared to Grandpa Jun\u2019s Sky Xuan. Also, he was caught off guard and therefore had to endure a slap in the face and a kick to his stomach. All he felt was his mind was ringing and stars were spinning right before his eyes!Although Grandpa Jun did not use any Xuan Qi in his attacks, they were both done in front of thousands of eyes. For Li You Ran, this strike was similar to striking his heart!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He maintained his courteous composure and said with a humble smile, \u201cSenior Duke\u2019s teachings are just. Please forgive this junior\u2019s offence.\u201dHe said those words with a smile. Although he had a deep sense of shame, his face expressed a smile of sincerity towards Jun Zhan Tian. It seemed that he was genuinely embarrassed by what he said earlier.Jun Zhan Tian\u2019s eyes widened when he suddenly felt an invisible pressure. This brat is no ordinary individual, judging by his calm demeanour! He is likely to be the ruthless type that would toy with people to their deaths. Jun Zhan Tian sighed, \u201cIf Mo Xie remained healthy, this brat would become his biggest rival amongst their generation!\u201dHe coldly turned around and scoffed, \u201cThe Li family line is indeed the sinister type.\u201d Grand Preceptor Li Shang\u2019s beard trembled. Jun Zhan Tian\u2019s words were the equivalent to cursing the entire Li Ancestral.\u201cEveryone move out of the way and let him search! Old bag Jun! If you can\u2019t find the assassins, I will have a good \u2018discussion\u2019 with you before His Majesty tomorrow! When that happens, I\u2019ll see if you can still maintain this arrogance!\u201d Li Shang waved his hand coldly, turned around and sat under a flower tree. He closed his eyes and remained motionless.Jun Zhan Tian waved his hand again, \u201cSearch carefully! Don\u2019t miss out a single spot and don\u2019t leave any stone unturned!\u201d Behind him, nearly a thousand soldiers shouted their affirmation in unison and fiercely rushed in.In an instant, the entire Li Family was turned upside down to the point of a complete mess.A normal looking sedan chair was on a spot situated at some distance away from Li Residence. Four figures with indifferent expression stood around the sedan chair. The curtains of the sedan chair were lifted, revealing a profound set of eyes observing the situation on the Li Residence. The person\u2019s ears were focused on hearing the conversations within. This person had a squarish clear face. However, his eyebrows were slanted upwards like a pair of dragons soaring to the Heavens. He exuded a prestigious awe-aspiring aura even without moving nor say anything.After listening to a little, this person closed his eyes and murmured, \u201cJun Zhan Tian\u2019s stubbornness against the Li Family this time is indeed a little overboard. It is only normal for the Li Family to have secrets regarding their family\u2019s protection that would prove dangerous if revealed. If these secrets were exposed, the Li Family would disappear. Jun\u00a0Zhan Tian wouldn\u2019t let them off easily but the kingdom still needs the Li Family.\u201d The person frowned, seemingly having a headache, \u201cShadow, if something unexpected were to happen, you\u2019ll need to step forward and solve it.\u201dNot a single sound could be heard from the outside but this person knew that his command was received. He then closed his eyes, his fingers tapping a jade tea table. His eyebrows moved, seemingly coming closer and intertwining one another. A thought flashed through his mind, \u201cLi Shang\u2019s grandson is not any talent, he is a very dangerous talent\u2026\u201dJun Zhan Tian\u2019s soldiers \u2018searched\u2019 as they moved, topping cabinets and flipping containers, which caused things to fall and crash. It seemed as though these men were not looking for assassins but were here purely to carry out acts of destructions!\u201cPeng!\u201d A huge vase was thrown out and shattered into pieces. The Grand Preceptor Li Shan\u2019s face twitched violently for an instant, \u201cThere is only a number of those vases\u2026\u201d\u201cPeng!\u201d\u201cPeng\u2026 \u2026\u201dGrandpa Jun looked with a cold look on his face holding onto his horsewhip. He inhaled deeply and shouted, \u201cI want you to search viciously!\u201d Although the atmosphere was extremely solemn, the soldiers standing behind him all turned their heads and secretly laughed. Could the word \u2018viciously\u2019 be used as an adjective for searching? The Senior Duke Jun\u2019s use of words was apparently \u2018Inappropriate\u2019.The word \u2018viciously\u2019 should be used with \u2018crush\u2019! Crush everything viciously!\u201cThis old thing can be rather funny! It almost seemed that he was afraid that the people wouldn\u2019t know that he was simply trying to create havoc! Let us observe for a little while longer!\u201d The man in the sedan chair could not help but let out a smile.The soldiers continued to \u2018search\u2019 with even more \u2018force\u2019 upon hearing the word \u201cviciously\u201d.Almost two thousand soldiers entered the Li Residence, acting as though they broke into an enemy\u2019s fortress. Anything that can be destroyed was destroyed and anything that could be thrown was thrown. The Li Family stared at this spectacle from the courtyard with blood dripping out from their hear, \u201cAll that \u2026 is money ah!\u201dAfter observing, the man in the sedan chair close his eyes slightly and whispered, \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any problem here, let\u2019s go back.\u201d He closed the curtains and sat upon his soft seat before closing his eyes.Apparently, the old Jun Zhan Tian had already understood his intentions. He only destroyed the things that were place conspicuously. As for the secret area, he simply avoided it. It seemed that there would not be any problems here.\u201cI\u2019d like to see, after this round of chaos, which family would still dare to pick sides again!\u201d The man in the sedan chair smiled, \u201cEven if you want to fight, you must fight within certain limits. Once your actions endanger the safety of the kingdom, then what happened today is a \u2026 Warning!\u201dThe sedan chair left quietly without a trace. Jun Zhan Tian continued standing still but Jun Wu Yu turned back to look for a moment after the sedan chair had left.\u201cGrand Marshall, there is no trace of the assassins found!\u201d One by one, the soldiers came forth to present their report, each stating that the assassins were not found. Jun Zhan Tian became furious and shouted, \u201cAre you trying to say that the assassins have flown off into the skies? Hmph! Are they not in the Li Residence? Then we\u2019ll have to go to another residence to resume our search!\u201d Leading the soldiers, he strode out to the main gate, jumped onto his horse and rode forward. The direction he took was heading towards the Meng FamilyThe Li Family members stared at their compound with tears flowing as it had turned into a beggars living area.The Grand Preceptor Li Shang patted his waist as he struggled to get up. Li You Ran rushed forth to help him. Both of them looked into each other\u2019s eyes and they saw anger in them.\u201cGrandfather, anyone with good eyes could tell that those men in black belonged to Jun Zhan Tian!\u00a0Jun Zhan Tian kept touting \u2018searching for assassins\u2019 as an excuse and threw false charges at others. His actions are similar to a rebellion. Since he couldn\u2019t find any assassins, tomorrow grandfather can get together with a group of officials and heavily step down in him.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLi You Ran considered, \u201cJun Zhan Tian was obviously showing signs of going mental, mobilising the military for personal reasons; trespassing into the homes of court officials and searching them wantonly. Ha Ha, if we could bring about the demise of the Jun Family with the destruction of our properties, that would be a reasonable transaction. On the contrary, if Grandfather chooses to stay your hand, others might think that you have a guilty conscience.\u201dLi Shang frowned, gave a deep sigh and spoke in a deep voice, \u201cYou Ran, you are a talented genius who possesses a wisdom that surpasses the masses. In the area of strategy, you\u2019ve proven yourself to be capable of identifying the enemy\u2019s weak points. Watching you become the top amongst the talents of your generation, Grandfather has always felt happy about it. However, you also have your weaknesses. One example would be the area of governance. You\u2019re still too young. Therefore, the things you could envision are limited!\u201d\u201cGovernance?\u201d Li You Ran became puzzled. \u201cAre you saying that this amount of crime is not enough for His Majesty to take action against Jun Zhan Tian and his family?\u201d\u201cEnough? No, it\u2019s not! It is far from enough!\u201d Li Shang\u2019s white eyebrows quivered, The earlier expression of anger and helplessness he showed before Jun Zhan Tian had lifted. It was replaced with an expression of endless shrewdness. Obviously, he faked the expression earlier. \u201cYou still don\u2019t understand just how much trust His Majesty has for Jun Zhan Tian. For starters, Jun Zhan Tian saved His Majesty\u2019s life at least six times or more. Back then if Jun Zhan Tian wanted to rebel or if he had even the slightest bit of secret ambition, then the seat of the Emperor would long have been his! It\u2019s true that there can be no love within the royal family. However, one would never treat an absolute loyalist as a mortal enemy. This is also the main reason why the Jun Family had fallen to a point of nearly losing all their successors and could retain so much power over the military!\u201d\u201cSimply with those few thing that occurred earlier, did you think it would be possible to bring Jun Zhan Tian down?\u201d Li Shang laughed out a bit, \u201cDo you really take Jun Zhan Tian to be such an idiot who would offer the Li Family to the bloody end? Also, based on his earlier movements, do you think that he had forced us into the corner?\u201dLi You Ran was intelligent. In just moments, he had comprehended the points mentioned.

Not a single one of us would live! That would have been Jun Zhan Tian\u2019s original intention. If there weren\u2019t the case, he wouldn\u2019t have gone to the extent of mobilising the army! Somewhere in between, something must have happened to change his mind. As for the person who could cause Jun Zhan Tian to change his mind was none other than the Emperor! Oh, there is another, his grandson, Jun Mo Xie. Earlier, you told me that the debauchee was killed. It seemed that may not be the case. If Jun Mo Xie really died, even His Majesty may not be capable of holding Jun Zhan Tian back. Therefore, I believe that Jun Mo Xie is still alive. In addition, Jun Zhan Tian should have only received this information recently.\u201d\u201cHence, Jun Zhan Tian had very little influence over what had happened. Although today it seemed that we have fallen into misfortune for no reason. I believe that there would be others who are far worse off compared to us.\u201d Li Shang laugher, \u201cHis Majesty was provoked by the assassination attempt on the Imperial Princess. Therefore, His Majesty decided to utilise Jun Zhan Tian\u2019s anger to rearrange the power base amongst the three Princes.\u201d\u201cAll the families or officials who had chosen to side with the Princes would receive a \u2018warning\u2019 tonight. Some could even be exiled or be harshly dealt with. As for those within the Imperial Palace, the \u2018rearrangement\u2019 should be finished by now. A pity that all our preparations\u2026\u201d\u201cIt was unexpected and inevitable that Jun Zhan Tian will go berserk today. If we were to grasped onto Jun Mo Xie back then, this old man would have gone berserk a long time ago! Hence, His Majesty took advantage of Jun Zhan Tian\u2019s act of madness to \u2026 Ha Ha\u2026 His Majesty took this opportunity to weaken the Jun Family\u2019s military power and suppress the powers of the other big families like ours before suppressing this incident! The mastermind behind Jun Zhan Tian is none other than the Emperor himself! The Emperor has the greatest comprehension of what happened tonight! So then, do you think we could do anything to that Old Jun?\u201dLi You Ran was shocked. He never imagined that his grandfather had thought so far ahead. He comprehended the thought process of everyone involved, especially the thoughts of the one standing on top within the Tian Xiang Kingdom!\u201cHis Majesty is a man of great talent. It is only normal that he doesn\u2019t want his successor to be an incompetent person. Therefore, His Majesty allowed the three Princes to compere, However, his majesty doesn\u2019t wish to escalate matters to a point of no control. Hence once the three Princes go overboard, His Majesty would clear the board and restart everything again. That is the reason why the great families with\u00a0true power within the city will never participate in the struggle between the Princes!\u201d\u201cRemember, forget everything that had happened today. Never take action till the situation had stabilised! Just look there.\u201d Li Shang pointed at the great smoke billowing up into the skies, \u201cAll those who chose to take actions in advance have all been sent on their merry way to Heaven.\u201d\u201cIf that is the case, does that mean that we\u2019ll do nothing with regards to what had happened today?\u201d Li You Ran asked.\u201cHow can we simply do nothing? Even if we wanted to, His Majesty wouldn\u2019t like it.\u201d Li Shang smiled craftily, \u201cHence, we must lodge a complaint tomorrow. Only then would His Majesty have a reason to suppress the great families, which was His Majesty\u2019s true intention. We will have trouble in the future If we don\u2019t go along.Li You Ran was in a state of deep contemplation. He was intelligent, a civil and military affairs genius. Yet, listening to those words, he realised that he lacked in the comprehension of political affairs.He gently stroked the part of his face which Jun Zhan Tian slapped, his eyes, like a poisonous snake, flashed with a chilling glint.\u201cI, Li You Ran, will never forget this slap of yours.\u201dAt the same time, the Meng Residence was in total chaos\u2026Compared to the Li Family, the Meng Family was in a worse situation. Their homes had been \u2018searched\u2019 to the point of being destroyed. However, Jun Zhan Tian was depressed as this was not his intentions nor the outcome he wanted.The capital will become calm for a long period of time after this incident. At least, this was how it would appear in plain sight.Since His Majesty said that Mo Xie was still alive, then this senior will become His Majesty\u2019s \u2018spear\u2019. Although the ending is somewhat anticlimactic, doing so is quite worthwhile. The original intention was to kill everyone. Although a large number of them were killed, the most important ones must be spared\u2026Suddenly, a hasty sound rang out, \u201cJun Zhan Tian, you\u2026 you ignorant old man! Stop it!\u201dJun Zhan Tian\u2019s body was in a shock, he could not believe what he heard.He turned around slowly and his eyes stared straight. His face revealed a mad look of joy.A skinny and withered looking old man appeared, his arms carried someone to his chest. The old man shot out and appeared in front of Jun Zhan Tian, breathless. However, Jun Zhan Tian paid no attention to him. He quickly dismounted from his horse and rushed to the emaciated old man. Jun Zhan Tian retrieved the person that the old man was carrying and spoke in a trembling voice, \u201d Mo Xie?\u201dCoincidentally, these two people returned when everything was just about to be finished\u2026Jun Xie looked up became overly surprised, obviously because the old man who had just escaped from the clutches of absolute despair, was hugging him as though he was holding onto the world\u2019s most precious treasure! The deep wrinkles on his face harboured the nostalgic feeling of concern, an ecstatic feeling when finding something that was thought to be lost forever. His fingers trembled and his eyes turned red with excitement! Jun Xie\u2019s heart begun shaking\u2026This was the commander of a million soldiers, a resilient iron-blooded man who has returned from hundreds of battles victoriously! Being able to see his grandson alive, this sudden surprise, turned him into a frail and ailing elderly folk.At this moment, Jun Xie felt something well up from the bottom of his heart. It was a feeling, an aching feeling that gave him a sense of warmth and comfort. Also, he felt his nose turning sour\u2026 and had difficulty breathing, his nose seemed to stop working, a feeling which made him desire to cry out.Is this the kinship he was dreaming of?In his past and present lives, was there anyone who had shown so much care for him?In his past and present lives, was there anyone who would brazenly mobilize the kingdom\u2019s army for his sake?In his past and present lives, who would disregard themselves for his sake?Who would have fallen into absolute despair for his sake?

Looking at Jun Xie, he was filled with surprise, happiness and satisfaction! His pair of tiger-like eyes had unknowingly turned teary. He secretly turned his head, allowing the tears to drop down before turning back, a smile etched on his face\u2026This is my family!Am I supposed to resist all this?No!At this moment, Jun Xie had suddenly accepted this body, accepted this family!

The scene was akin to a group of merchants and farmers arguing at the marketplace.The atmosphere turned silent after the ritualistic greeting towards His Majesty. Just like the calm before the storm\u2026A pile of petitions calling for the impeachment of Jun Zhan Tian was stacked before His Majesty. After observing the Imperial Court, His Majesty was surprised to see a number of vacant positions. Although he expected it, this result has greatly surpassed his expectations, \u201cIsn\u2019t this a little too much?\u201dHe already received the report last night. However, the report only had names written on it. To witness the results was something else. A good chunk of the Imperial Court members had disappeared\u2026 His Majesty was unable to get used to it!For example, one was a student in a classroom with a hundred students. If someone were to receive news in the middle of the night that thirty of their students had either transferred or dropped out, that person will feel indifferent. However, when that person notices the empty space in the classroom\u2026 This comparison was probably an apt description of what was happening in the Tian Xiang Kingdom\u2019s Imperial Court.After the Imperial Princess suffered from the assassination attempt last night, Grandpa Jun took action and issued a declaration that a calamity had occurred. Within Tian Xiang City, flames began rising rampantly and people were murdered. More than ten high-ranking members of the Imperial Court ended up being decapitated. Also, many of these people were once the Jun Family\u2019s bitter enemies\u2026Also, all those men had another common aspect. These men chose to side with one of the Imperial Princes. However, this common aspect was something that everyone had chosen to keep it to themselves. Right now, blurting that out would the same as courting death!There were twelve amongst last night\u2019s incident had the qualifications to stand in court today. Coincidentally, there were split equally into groups of four amongst the three Princes. The people were an Assistant Minister of Justice, two Assistant Minister of Personnel, three from the Minister of Rites, one from the Minister of State Revenue, three Imperial Censors and two scholars. These were people that could be accountable in court. As for those who are not in court, how many were killed?Those who had consistently opposed the \u2018rough\u2019 members of the Imperial Court and had been badly hurt during the kingdom\u2019s present crisis have all come together. This was simply part of a certain highly positioned individual\u2019s plan. Although last night, he himself had been angered to the point of having his eyes turn blue\u2026For the ministers who were sharp-eyed with a great memory realised something. Today, there were new faces within the Imperial Palace. Most of the usual people disappeared. For example, the Captain of the Armed Guards, Murong Qianjun. He was a talent whose promotion speed was considered \u2018rare\u2019, at times getting promoted three times in a day. However, this rising star of the Murong Family had at this point in time disappeared to who knows where\u2026It seemed that the carnage within the Imperial Palace was no less vicious compared to the outside. A lot of people became nervous.\u201cWhat happened last night? Why are there so little people today? Who can answer me?\u201d His Majesty was indeed a master amongst masters in the \u2018political affairs\u2019. Blinking his eyes, he used the corner of his eyes to stare at Jun Zhan Tian who was dozing off. Senior Duke Jun was truly feeling sleepy from yesterday\u2019s events. This was obvious just by looking at his face. Otherwise, he would not have dozed off in the Imperial Court; he had almost begun snoring\u2026His Majesty\u2019s pretence of not knowing what had happened was the opening act for the Imperial Court members to begin their barrage of accusations! Within the Imperial Hall, a large number of people went down on their knees.\u201cYour Majesty, we seek justice.\u201d A huge number of ministers spoke out with tears flowing down their eyes, They had grief-stricken expressions as they kowtowed vigorously.\u201cDear Ministers, if you have anything to say, just say it out in detail. Rise up and tell me all about it,\u201d The Emperor frowned with a puzzled look on his face.The ministers all turned on Senior Duke Jun, Jun Zhan Tian, once His Majesty finished his sentence. They started their barrage of accusations, \u201cAlthough he is someone who had accomplished great merits for the kingdom, he disregarded the kingdom\u2019s military laws.\u00a0He mobilised the kingdom\u2019s military forces for personal reasons. He abhorred the kingdom\u2019s laws and regulations. He viewed the powers of the Imperial Family with contempt. He acted wantonly. He trespassed the residences of ministers. He allowed his subordinates to wreak havoc and act lawlessly.\u201d There were even some heavyweight accusations, \u201cHe had amassed his own personal army. He has the intention of rebelling\u2026\u201d In short, there were innumerable accusations directed at him, all supposedly supported with conclusive evidence!Thereafter, the accusations escalated to the next level, where it was recommended that Jun Zhan Tian be dismissed and his entire family decapitated, going so far as having his nine kindreds exterminated\u2026 At this moment, the atmosphere of the Imperial Court had become intense.Everyone\u2019s faces were flushed red, each and every one of them was filled with rage. In the end, they all chorused out, \u201cNot killing Jun Zhan Tian endangers the Imperial Family\u2019s powers! The people would not be appeased if Jun Zhan Tian was not killed!\u201dJun Zhan Tian turned his gaze up with his eyes slightly closed. He could only think of his heavily injured grandson as he watched the performance by the ministers in the Imperial Court. He was pondering on how to ask His Majesty to loan him the best Imperial Doctor\u2026\u201cJun Zhan Tian! You old thing, you actually dared to act in such a brazen manner! What do you\u2019ve to say for yourself?\u201d His Majesty questioned him in a very harsh tone, seemingly furious!\u201cYour Majesty, yesterday, I received news that the Princess had suffered from an assassination attempt just outside the Imperial Palace. Luckily, the Princess managed to escape unscathed. However, hearing that those criminals dared to act so wild; going so far as to profane the dignity of the Imperial Family, this old minister felt an unquenchable anger gush out from my heart. Thereafter, I received further news that the assassins may harbour the additional intention of assassinating the members of the Imperial Family and high-ranking officials of the Imperial Court. This old minister feared that any delay would bring about irreparable consequences. Therefore, I had to mobilise the army before reporting to Your Majesty, all for the sake of capturing the assassins. To this point, I\u2019ve indeed committed a mistake. This old minister begs Your Majesty\u2019s for a careful inquiry and just punishment!\u201dThe Emperor\u2019s mouth was about to lash out, but had forcibly held himself back, \u201cYou old brat! You\u2019ve already said everything in great detail, what else do I have to inquire? Inquire my buttocks! You\u2019ve portrayed yourself in such a righteous light, punishing you would make me a muddle-headed ruler! How am I supposed to continue with this punishment?\u201d\u201cResume.\u201d His Majesty, the Emperor, frowned seemingly unpleased. His Majesty was truly at a loss on how to continue from there.\u201cYes! I was worried about the matter and didn\u2019t have the time to inform Your Majesty. This old minister got up in the middle of the night and rushed to the military field without dressing up properly. Although the mobilization of soldiers was executed quickly, we were unable to stop the assassins. These assassins had come prepared and turned the city upside down in an instant. I\u2019ve exerted every last ounce of effort without reserve and served as a vanguard to wage a bloody battle against the many insidious assassins. It took a while but we finally managed to handle this disaster and finished off the assassins! There were hundreds of assassins, their bodies were then hanged for public display before the city gates. Yet I dare not claim credit for these actions because there were some regrettable events. Although this old minister had tried my best, there were lots of officials whom I\u2019ve failed to reach in time, thus resulting in them being brutally murdered by the assassins! Their horrible deaths were all due to my carelessness and slow response to this situation! I am willing to accept the punishment for my crime of sloppiness in executing my duties!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGrandpa Jun sighed, mourning, \u201cAll those lives were the pillars of the Tian Xiang Kingdom\u2026\u201d He rubbed his eyes and appeared to be on the verge of crying.Honestly, he was just feeling sleepy\u2026Upon hearing Senior Duke Jun\u2019s words, all the ministers within the Imperial Court heard turned to face one another, \u201cWhat? You\u2019re willing to accept the punishments for your crime? Accept your mother\u2019s head! Listening to you, you are simply the great hero that has single-handedly saved all of Tian Xiang Kingdom! Acting decisively, turning the situation around in a matter of moments, the one who carried a heavy burden to save the common people, the loyal minister who placed the importance of protecting the dignity of the Imperial Family before everything! Since you\u2019ve put it that way, not giving you a great amount of reward would be a huge loss of reputation. Yet, you said that you are willing to accept punishment?\u201dBesides, was there anyone here who did not know that those men in black were part of the Jun Family? Assassins? What a joke? How does one describe the act of turning lies to facts? This is how! We have seen outrageous, but we have never seen such a high level of chutzpah before! Turning the act of raiding other people\u2019s residence into a meritorious deed, this level of gibberish expertise had reached a completely new level!A mountain worth revering!As for those dead men that were left hanging for public display, if the Prison Chief of the Minister of Justice were to examine, he would certainly find them very familiar, \u201cBecause those people were simply a bunch of death row prisoners.

To be honest, Grandpa Jun\u2019s explanation and justifications were simply unbearable, it is easy to refute. After all, Grandpa Jun was first and foremost a general. His skills in civil topics are too confined. It was actually rare for him to simply make an explanation. Asking for a detailed and seamless explanation was absolutely ridiculous!Suddenly, an old man with white hair and beard stepped forward. This old man possesses a stalwart figure. Standing beside Jun Zhan Tian, it felt as though there were two majestic mountains enforcing their grand aura in the Imperial court. His moustache spread out explosively to the side of his cheeks and beard. A wild looking face and a loutish frame. This was none other than Grandfather Dugu, the second most powerful individual within the military in Tian Xiang kingdom, and the primary predator within the capital city: Dugu Zong Heng!He is the most savage person in Tian Xiang kingdom! The most unreasonable man! The toughest shank! The most brilliant family\u2026 great families\u2019 House Master. This man has a skin so thick that he could be revered as the master in thick-skin! He is a character who would brandish his lack of expertise as knowledge! this is an individual who would converse about massive swords when discussing reasons! All the members of the Imperial Court, be they from the civil or military affairs showed some hint of fear towards him. Even the current Emperor was unable to deal with him.It was only when he stepped forward, then the members of the Imperial Court realized his presence. They could not help but whisper amongst themselves, \u201cThis old man had not attended the courtroom for years now. Why did he all of a sudden appear today? For him to appear at such a sensitive moment, is simply queer.\u201dDugu Zong Heng\u2019s eyes widened like a mountain bear. He then cupped his fingers and spoke in a hoarse voice. \u201cYour Majesty, the assassination attempt on the Imperial Princess and the officials of the Imperial court is indeed a nationwide situation that could cripple the foundations of the kingdom. Fortunately, this old bag\u2026 Senior Duke Jun Zhan Tian was swift and decisive in his actions, hence succeeding in averting this terrible disaster! This old man thinks that Senior Jun\u2019s actions this time wasn\u2019t a mistake! Not only is he innocent, he has also earned himself a merit! An astounding amount of merit!\u201dA slender old man with a sheep-like beard who was beside him sneered, \u201cAfter this traitor defied the authority of the ministers and disrupted the Imperial Court\u2019s affairs, he\u2019s lauded as a person who earned himself a merit? If that is how the Imperial Court works, then won\u2019t we become despised by the people of the world?\u201dThis slender old man with barely any flesh on his frame with a sheep-like beard is one of the three most successful individual from the Meng family, Meng You Fang. last night, his house suffered the most amount of damage. Not even a single tile was left unscathed. A high ranking member of the Imperial court had to bring his own family out into the rich and bustling capital in the middle of the night to suffer the cold air and sleep underneath the starry skies of the night. The amount of suffocation he felt nearly caused him to puke out blood! Watching these military leaders reversing black and white, he was unable to bear it in anymore and decided to step forward.Dugu Zong Heng became furious. He turned around and stared at Meng You Fang viciously, revealing a yellow set of teeth as he opened his mouth; his voice shook the tiles in the Imperial Court, \u201cScrew your grandmother! You\u2019re worse than dog faeces! Are you suggesting that this senior is wrong? Hmm?\u201d As if performing in concert along with his fury, his beard exploded out, his facial hairs standing upright. His mouth opened wide, as though he wanted to swallow the slender old man with the sheep-like beard, his whole body radiates a malicious aura.Beside him, the great general Dugu Wu Di stepped forward immediately to help, \u201cMeng You Fang, what\u2019re you trying to do? My father is conversing with his Majesty! Do you think someone like is qualified to disrupt them?\u201d His hands extended outwards, his palm opened wide like a palm leaf, intent on catching him by his neck.All the senior ministers rolled their eyes, \u201cThis father and son duo is really\u2026 invincible (w\u00fa d\u00ed). They dared to bully others in the presence of His Majesty! His Majesty, the Emperor who was supposedly the most important individual of this play couldn\u2019t help but stare in a dumbfounded manner!\u201d\u201cEnough!\u201d His Majesty, the Emperor thundered loudly and stood up in fury. \u201cA group of civil and military ministers arguing with one another, and starting a fight in the Imperial Court! What do you plan to do next? Are you going to start throwing obscenities around?\u201dHis Majesty\u2019s wrath prompted everyone to turn silent, except the old Masters from the Jun family, Dugu family, Li family, Meng family, Song family, Tang family and Murong family. As for the others, they all knelt down immediately and spoke out in unison. \u201cThis minister is guilty, I am inclined to accept Your Majesty\u2019s punishment.\u201d\u201cVery well, I\u2019ve understood the gist of what happened. Firstly, Jun Zhan Tian wanted to capture the assassins but had made mistakes in his mobilization of the army. His actions brought about the kingdom to fall into chaos. As punishment, one year\u2019s worth of salary will be deducted. Also, I decree that you aren\u2019t allowed to leave your residence for 3 months. However, in light of your contribution of capturing the assassins, I shall reward you one thousand gold liangs and a thousand-year-old ginseng. Military matters will temporarily be handed over to Dugu Zong Heng to deal with. Lastly, you great families chose to ignore the truth and focused only on your personal losses, blatantly accusing other ministers. All your positions are downgraded by one rank. In order to avoid riots from happening, all military authority of the great families must be returned to the Military Division. It will be reassigned again one year later.\u201dDeducting a year\u2019s worth of income and prohibited to leave his home for three months; a reward of one thousand gold liangs and a thousand-year-old ginseng! How is this still be considered a punishment? In fact, this is a reward and holidays\u2026There was also the \u2018Military matters will temporarily be handed over to Dugu Zong Heng to deal with\u2019. This sentence seemed to be hiding a different meaning. However, there is an issue. All of the ministers looked towards the father and son duo \u2013 \u2018tough shanks\u2019. They were all thinking the same thing, \u201cIf this is how is to end, wouldn\u2019t it be better to have Jun Zhan Tian to retain his military hierarchy? The father and son duo from the Dugu family is a bigger threat than Jun Zhan Tian\u2026\u201dAt least, Old Master Jun is a reasonable individual. On the other hand, this father and son pair had never been reasonable at all. Now that their family\u2019s private forces were about to fall into their hands, they wonder how many could return.In just a moment\u2019s time, almost everyone started cursing secretly and nearly lashed out at Meng You Fang, \u201cHis Majesty was manipulating the entire thing. Since Dugu Zongheng had already appeared, why did you have to step in and intervene? You don\u2019t recognise your own strengths and weaknesses, but don\u2019t you at the least comprehend the meaning of \u2018humiliation\u2019? If you intend to fall off a cliff, you should do it alone. Why the heck did you drag us all down with you? How damaged are you\u2026Almost everyone in the Imperial Court revealed an expression of one who had just lost their soul and vigour. It does not matter if it was real or fake. What was vital was that it seemed real on the surface. As a member of the Imperial Court, they ought to have the capacity to put on an act. otherwise, it might be difficult for them to continue serving for long.Yet, there a couple of people inside the Imperial Court who lowered their heads with anger etched upon their faces. These were the men who could not stomach their grievances; they were truly enraged and were unwilling to let it pass. However, all of them have had their identities noted down by all the senior \u2018grandfathers\u2019 of the Imperial Court, \u201cThey couldn\u2019t even understand that a performance is in progress, these people don\u2019t have any future in store for them! When we return home later, we need to inform our sons and grandsons to stay away from these people. Otherwise, who knows when we might end up being dragged down by them\u2026\u201cYou fellow Ministers are all the pillars of our kingdom. Today, to witness such a scene occurring in this Imperial Court\u2026 I\u2019m disappointed! Very disappointed!\u201d His Majesty became furious, unstoppably furious! After having meted out the punishments, His Majesty said with a heavy heart, \u201cThis matter is resolved following my instructions. Nobody is allowed to disobey it! You may leave now!\u201dThe Minister of Rites, Sun Cheng He shouted, \u201cYour Majesty, please stay\u2026\u201d This person was none other than Fatty Tang\u2019s future father-in-law.All of the senior grandpas in the Imperial Court burst out with a look of contempt, \u201cCouldn\u2019t you see that His Majesty is heading back to his chambers to relish the \u2018joy\u2019 from earlier. Ever resourceful, overlooking the world as its sovereign, delightfully manipulating everybody within the grasp of his hand, suppressing all of the great families influence in one fell swoop, bringing stability to the entire kingdom. How blissful would such an experience be? However, you actually chose to restrain His Majesty at this moment? Don\u2019t you want to live a good life anymore? What an idiot!\u201cWhat do you wish to discuss?\u201d His Majesty\u2019s face was furious. His Majesty\u2019s fury was originally staged, but after having been restrained, his false countenance of fury was beginning to turn real.\u201cYour Majesty, please understand, I am in charge of the ceremonies. However, today is the day for the annual Gifted Scholars\u2019 Autumn Festival Feast. What should I do\u2026\u201dThis Minister of Rites is really lacking the capacity to judge the situation. This is not a light problem! all of the ministers inside the Imperial Court sighed in their hearts, \u201cCouldn\u2019t you see the situation we\u2019ve got here? All the families are filled with tears and mourns, who would be in the mood to care about a Gifted Scholars\u2019 Autumn Festival Feast? This brat is genuinely an idiot\u2026 I will need to pay attention next time. I mustn\u2019t get too close to him, most probably he might be the demise of me!\u201dSure enough, His Majesty turned furious and spoke out in a heavy tone. \u201cGifted Scholars\u2019 Autumn Festival Feast? We\u2019re currently in the middle of troubling times, how can you even bring this up? If I recall, I had appointed two ministers to be in charge of organizing the feast just a few days ago. However, those\u00a0men are among the names of individuals who have been assassinated by the assassins!\u201d Having finished speaking, he pointed vigorously at the list of names on his table. Flicking his sleeves, His Majesty walked out with an expression of rage on his face.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euNo one was able to see it, but when His Majesty turned away, the sides of his lips curled, as though he was happy\u2026Indeed, no one was able to see it. However, all the old ministers were secretly feeling pleased with themselves as well, \u201cAs expected, everything went according to my predictions\u2026\u201dAfter His Majesty had left, everyone patted their knees and got up. Most of the elder ministers looked at each other with an \u2018as expected\u2019 gaze. Li Shang snorted and looked at Jun Zhan Tian with the corner of his eyes. \u201cOld Jun, congratulations. Has your grandson gotten better yet?\u201dThe purpose Li Shang mentioned this matter to Jun Zhan Tian was to piss him off. Even if Li Shang could not do anything to him this time, he ought to still prod Jun Zhantian until he chokes. That would not be too bad. However, as soon as Jun Zhan Tian heard that, he unexpectedly recalled what he wanted to do. Ignoring Li Shang, he ran in the direction His Majesty had went. \u201cYour Majesty, Your Majesty\u2026 I need to borrow that Death Warding Imperial Doctor for a while, this is an emergency.\u201dAll the ministers within the Imperial Court stumbled.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Simply because his grandson was a little hurt, he had become so anxious. He does not have the bearing of a great general at all, how derisive! For someone like me to be outranked by using such an ordinary guy, what a worldly tragedy!\u201dDugu Wu Di, his lips curled, and spoke out in agreement with his father as he nodded his head, \u201cA worldly tragedy indeed, how despicable!\u201dAll the ministers shook their heads in unison as they looked at them with utter contempt, \u201cAn insignificant scratch would have been a sufficient reason for you people from the Dugu family to raise a sky wrecking havoc. Yet, you have the gall to despise Jun Zhan Tian, how shameless! However, what Grandfather Dugu spoke today seemed rehearsed. It seemed that\u00a0one of the head clerks must have helped him out with his script\u2026\u201dEh? Could it be that he had rehearsed this for a long time? That was a shocking revelation! Could it be that something is going on in the Military Division? All the old foxes in the Imperial Court was shocked as they thought about it.Dugu Zongheng laughed happily,\u00a0seeing his son supporting him with complementing words. He stroked his beard and said, \u201cIn the end, my family is still the best. Producing nearly ten heirs at a go, every one of them is skilled dragons and fearsome tigers; unlike the Jun Family which only have a single fur.\u201dDugu Wudi nodded like a chicken pecking down at rice grains. \u201cIndeed! Indeed!\u201dA wave of contempt burst out from the crowd again, \u201cWith just one sentence, you began bragging about your family\u2019s foundation. Producing nearly ten heirs at a go? Have you regarded your daughter-in-laws as sows? How uncouth! Besides, your three sons have a total of twenty wives but only produce about ten grandchildren; you think you\u2019re qualified to brag?\u201dIgnoring the prideful father and son pair, they all shook their heads and left as they headed back home.Let us just assumed that everything that had happened in the past couple of days was an exhilarating farce. If we only knew that it would end like this\u2026 sigh.Thereafter, the palace guards saw Grandpa Jun triumphantly escorting an old man with white hair and beard, carrying a medical chest, out of the palace. On the horse that Grandpa Jun rode on, with another seat prepared!It turned out Grandpa Jun had already prepared a seat for the doctor before entering the palace\u2026indeed\u2026 a detailed plan!Who do you call a master? This is who you call a master!\u2026The great Young Master Jun, Jun Mo Xie, was lying in bed, putting all his effort to look ill. Honestly, he was feeling joyful inside.The Lolita, Little Ke, carefully served him spoonfuls of sweet bird\u2019s nest soup for him. There were also ginseng soup, eight treasures lotus soup\u2026 as long as it is nourishing, it was prepared for him. The only thing which made him unhappy was that Grandpa Jun would occasionally prepare a generous sum of Sixth level Xuan Beasts\u2019 blood. According to him, they were rare nourishing stuff. But, Jun Moxie would have to cover his nose and pour it down his throat or pour it down the bucket beside his bed\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s simply too hard to stomach! I am not a barbarian! Why would you give me blood to drink? It is so unhygienic! Would I survive?\u201dObviously, these were not what had made him elated. After having suffered from his injury, Jun Mo Xie realized that the Hongjun Pagoda within his consciousness was constantly rotating at high speed, releasing a rich amount of white, misty Spiritual Qi. The qi swept through his body\u2019s meridians over and over, focused on the damaged area. In less than a day, the sword wound on his chest was fully healed.After several coughs and some thick blackish-red coloured blood came out; the damaged area on his chest reduced considerably. As for the wound on his thigh where one could see through to the other side, it only \u2018seemed\u2019 serious. After the continued restoration effects of the Spiritual Qi, he was no longer suffering from the pain from the wound. The only thing that gave Jun Mo Xie some discomfort was the waves of itchiness and numbness, which occurred every once in a while. However, Jun Mo Xie still felt comfortable. After all, as the saying goes, \u201cNo pain, no gain\u2026\u201dThat was not all, the Hongjun Pagoda\u2019s spiritual Qi kept gushing forth as though it would not stop till the wounds on Jun Moxie\u2019s body have completely disappeared. Clearly, Jun Moxie would not miss out on the opportunity to cultivate his Arts. He quickly activated the Art of Unlocking Heaven\u2019s Fortune, leading the near solid form of Spiritual Qi as he channelled them via his meridians. Whilst he was exercising the Arts, he realized something peculiar this time. turned into a semi-solid existence as it pummelled the area of the meridians that were suffering from blockages due to the sword wound. Almost instantly, the blockage was burst open. After that, he could clearly feel the qi flow within his meridians expanding bit by bit, becoming thicker bit by bit\u2026Usually, under these circumstances, the Hongjun Pagoda would stop releasing the Spiritual Qi. in this instance, it did not show any signs of stopping at all. Jun Mo Xie became elated. He gave up on his plans to restore the damage from the sword wound and focused obsessively on leading the Spiritual Qi in order to increase his qi flow, secretly becoming joyful over this unfortunate event.Suddenly, Jun Mo Xie felt that his behaviour was similar to those of scammers\u2026 Others were being kind to help you treat your injuries but you took advantage of this opportunity to increase your own strength instead. This was simply profiteering from other people\u2019s kindness\u2026However\u2026\u201cThese sort of scams, I would very much like to do more! I\u2019m already addicted to it! Who would not want to do this kind of fraud?\u201d Jun Mo Xie cried out as he grabbed onto the opportunity provided by this \u2018scam\u2019.Otherwise, what would he do when the Spiritual Qi\u2019s intensity has dropped down to its former level after his wounds were fully healed? He has now become accustomed to this high-quality delivery service of Spiritual Qi! Once his body has been fully restored, he could only cry,\u00a0\u201cperhaps I should stab myself again in order to achieve this suitable condition for cultivation?\u201dUnfortunately, some of the Spiritual Qi would still travel towards the wounded areas and began restoring those parts slowly. When the wound on his thigh was being restored, the itchiness sensation started to appear. The emission speed of Spiritual Qi from the Hongjun Pagoda begun retarding. After a while, the velocity of its rotation also slowed down and returned to its former state of silence within his sea of consciousness\u2026Jun Mo Xie woke up and gave a sigh within his heart, \u201cI still haven\u2019t had enough\u2026 this fast rate of cultivation is simply too addictive. Activating his inner eye, he could see a transparent qi flow slowly moving through his meridians. In the short span of just one night, the size of this qi flow had doubled! If one were to use the Xuan Qi cultivation as a standard of measure, then his current level of strength was at least at the Eighth level Xuan Qi! In addition, his qi had a high purity grade!In this world where Xuan Qi level of nine and below are ants; Silver and Gold Xuan experts were aplenty. No matter how pure his Eighth level Xuan Qi was, he was still a nobody. However, do not belittle Jun Mo Xie\u2019s cultivation speed. Just in case anyone had forgotten, he only arrived into this world about a month ago. Within this one months\u2019 time, he has successfully improved his body, which was only at the Third level Xuan Qi up to the Eighth level Xuan Qi! If those old Supreme Divine Xuan geezers witnessed this practice speed, they would be shocked to the point of having their decaying teeth falling out!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIf this world had an Institute of Anatomy where they dissect bodies for their studies. If they were to discover Jun Mo Xie\u2019s cultivation speed, they would likely move out to capture him and dissect him for studying? Jun Mo Xie gave a pleasant sigh of relief. He suddenly felt that the injury caused by the sword was\u2026 too bloody darned worth it! He began to seriously consider if he should just stab himself again!A bodyguard entered and reported, \u201cYoung Master, Young Master Tang is here to visit you.\u201dJun Mo Xie gave an \u201cOh\u201d. Then, he suddenly recalled something. He calmly picked up something that was wrapped up in a cloth beside his pillow and stuffed it into his blanket. Then, he spoke with a weak voice, \u201cInvite Young Master Tang in.\u201dThereafter, the sounds of heavy footsteps could be heard. Fatty Tang panted as he stepped into Jun Mo Xie\u2019s room, his face expressing exertions. At the same time, the vast room suddenly felt smaller. \u201cThird Young Master, you\u2019ve scared me.\u201d Tang Yuan\u2019s face revealed a state of shock. \u201cI heard that you were killed and cried the entire night. If we brothers were to be forced to part ways forever, then how was I suppose to continue living?\u201dJun Mo Xie stared weakly at the fatty before him. He had the urge to jump out of bed and kicked him out! However, he was currently playing the role of a heavily injured person. He will have to spare him for now.

Otherwise, I would be left alone. What would I ever do without you?\u201d Fatty Tang wiped away his tears. After that, he drank a cup of tea that Little Ke brought in and called out. \u201cCome quickly! LIft and bring in the gifts that my Tang Family has prepared for Third Young Master Jun!\u201dJun Mo Xie turned his attention to the outside, he was curious as to what kind of gifts did this brother prepare. He had even used the word \u201clift\u201d for the gifts, what kind of gifts could it be?Two big boxes were carried into the room by two men, their faces showed expressions of extreme difficulty. Suddenly, Jun Mo Xie\u2019s bedroom was completely occupied by Tang Yuan and the two big boxes. Even Little Ke did not have any space to occupy; she could only try to shrink her legs as she sat on the chair.Tang Yuan waved to get the two men to move out and laughed. He moved around with a mysterious aura as he giggled and glanced at Jun Mo Xie. After opening the box, he moved away allowing Jun Mo Xie to see the contents within. Upon seeing it, Jun Mo Xie nearly fainted.The box contained high-grade medicines, boxes after boxes, bottles after bottles, packages after packages\u2026 all of them were perfectly packed and the smell of medicine assailed one\u2019s nose. One look was enough to ensure that the things inside were all valuables. Jun Mo Xie wondered, \u201cdid this fatty sweep up all the medical shops in the capital?\u201dThese medicines would certainly prove useful for the common injured folks. In fact, these medicines were important. Also, even if one has money, some of these medicines might be impossible to obtain. Yet, the problem here was\u2026 Jun Mo Xie is not an ordinary person, he required none of this medicine.These items were no different from garbage in Jun Mo Xie\u2019s eyes. At the very least, it was only chicken ribs!Jun Mo Xie groaned and spoke feebly, \u201cFatty, you\u2019ve had it tough. Even if I were to get injured every day, these medicines could probably last a lifetime. Are you here to visit me or to curse me to get hurt more?\u201dTang Yuan slammed the cover of the box and spoke in a triumphant demeanour, \u201cThird Young Master, what do you think of your brother\u2019s technique of acquisition? As long as the medicine is available in Tian Xiang City, regardless if it is holy or pinnacle grade, all of it is now in these two boxes!\u201d After saying that, he stealthy moved closer to Jun Mo Xie and whispered furtively, \u201cThird Young Master, those in the bottom layer are the ones that I\u2019ve spent a huge amount of effort in acquiring. Those are very rare items that are very difficult to find so you must hide them carefully.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Jun Moxie became interested; his eyebrows were raised as he asked.Tang Yuan gave a furtive glance, smiling indecently, at Little Ke and replied, \u201cThey are those that you will be most interested in, treasures that make females strong, Joysong Grass, Kinky Lady, Chaste Breaker, Golden Spirit Spear, Infallible Rod, Wall Piercer, Hundred Jin Hoist\u2026\u201cStop! Stop! Stop!\u201d Jun Mo Xie was shocked, \u201cWhat in the world are all those weird stuff? What is that\u2026 Hundred Jin Hoist, just what is that?\u201d\u201cHundred Jin Hoist, hahaha\u2026\u201d Tang Yuan let out another obscene smile. Pointing at Jun Moxie\u2019s crotch, he whispered. \u201cIt means when you eat that item, then your d*ck could hoist up a hundred jin (60.5 kg)\u2026 oooh, good stuff!\u201d Hearing Jun Mo Xie use the words \u2018stuff\u2019, Tang Yuan decided to follow suit.\u201cBloody Hell! Don\u2019t do this to me, that is simply too uncouth!\u201d Jun Mo Xie felt himself having a headache. \u201cHurry! Move it away! If my grandfather were to see it, he might decide to just cut my d*ck off! I want to take it with me into the afterlife! Don\u2019t bring such calamity to me!\u201d\u201cWhat are you afraid of? As long as one is a man, he will certainly appreciate this \u2018stuff\u2019. If I am not mistaken, Senior Boss Jun should have this as well. After all, there is nothing to scoff at his age. Without the help of this \u2018stuff\u2019, even with his glorious bearing, he may not be able\u2026 hehe\u2026\u201d Tang Yuan laughed out recklessly. Suddenly\u2026\u201cWhat \u2018stuff\u2019 do I also have?\u201d A deep, profound voice sounded out and Grandpa Jun stepped into view just outside the doors. A puzzled expression was on his face as he glanced at Tang Yuan before looking at the cramped room. \u201cWhat is going on? What were you just talking about earlier?\u201dWhy is my luck so sh*tty! Tang Yuan was stunned, he was perspiring profusely, his eyes rolling about in disorder. The floor below his obese body had, in an instant became a pool of sweat, \u201cOh, my pitiful life! If Old Master Jun heard those words I said\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat is all this stuff?\u201d Grandpa Jun was annoyed. \u201cQuickly move this mess away!\u201dTang Yuan immediately straightened himself up, nodding his head like a chicken pecking on grains. \u201cYes, yes! I will take them out immediately! These are just some common herbs and medicine, nothing special.\u201dThereafter, Grandpa Jun spoke again, \u201cFatty, what was the item that you said I have?\u201dTang Yuan\u2019s face suddenly became contorted, his complexion turned white, then red, then green. His fat cheeks trembled uncontrollably and his thigh quaked\u2026\u201cUh, Fatty was talking about your imposing aura, he even mentioned that His Majesty\u2019s aura could also be felt from you, but decided to stop because the subject was too taboo,\u201d Jun Mo Xie quickly stepped in to resolve the matter. Watching the poor Fatty\u2019s pitiful figure, he estimated that Fatty would probably turn to stone from just another word by Grandpa Jun.\u201cWhat is the subject so taboo? Why do you need to be scared to such an extent? This senior simply possess a grand, imposing and heroic aura that would never fade, that is a fact!\u201d Grandpa Jun looked at Tang Yuan with an expression of disdain and continued. \u201cIn the future, don\u2019t invite our Mo Xie to those shady places anymore. Back then, he has led astray because he followed you all the time.\u201d\u201cAh!?\u201d Tang Yuan became shocked, \u201cOld Master, how could you flip right and wrong to such an extent? Back then, I was the one who followed your grandson and turned bad as a result\u2026\u201dGrandpa Jun snorted. His grandson will always be a good grandson in his heart. As for all the disappointing things which happened back then, the could obviously be due to this bad apple of a friend\u2026The bodyguards came in and lifted the two boxes up. Tang Yuan then urgently said. \u201cThe second box\u2026\u201dJun Mo Xie started to sweat, \u201cCould it be that the items in the second box are even more unbearable than the first? Are you trying to get me killed\u2026\u201dGrandpa Jun waved his hand, commanding the men to carry the two boxes of gifts away. Little Ke followed them. It was only then that the both of them let out a sigh of relief.An old man with white hair and beard walked in; his face was one of kindness and harmony; he was carrying a small medicine chest. Tang Yuan was shocked; he quickly bowed in a respectful manner and saluted, \u201cSir Fang.\u201dSir Fang was none other than the Chief of the Imperial Doctors, Fang Hui Sheng. Those within Tian Xiang City also gave him a resounding nickname, \u201cDeath Warding Fang!\u201d The meaning behind the name was that regardless of how grievous one\u2019s injuries was, once the Imperial Doctor Fang treats that person, that person will not die! This description towards him may have been exaggerated, however, his expertise in the field of medicine was indeed indisputable. If Hua Tuo was resurrected, then he would probably be his equal.In the past, Tang Yuan was seriously ill and all the doctors in the capital were unable to cure him. At the most critical moment, Sir Fang appeared and treat him, saving him from the brink of death. Thus, Tang Yuan showed a great deal of respect towards Sir Fang. After all, he was the one who saved his life.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euFang Hui Sheng nodded and gave a gentle smile. Without speaking, he sat on the bed and his hands grasped onto Jun Mo Xie\u2019s wrist, feeling the pulse on his wrist. He carefully observed Jun Mo Xie\u2019s complexion, pulling up his eyelids and asking him to extend his tongue out for observation.It was at this instance that Jun Mo Xie\u2019s had an idea popped into mind.Using his internal energies, he exerted control over the qi flow of his body. It suddenly moved, causing his meridians to pulse in an abnormal manner.No one could detect this method as it was something that this world had no knowledge of.Fang Hui Sheng\u2019s face gradually turned serious. He had originally assumed that Jun Zhan Tian was simply making a mountain out of a molehill by dragging him here. However, after examining his patient\u2019s pulse, he realized that this youngster before him was in a dire state!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He asked, \u201cOld Fang, how is it?\u201dFang Hui Sheng looked at Jun Mo Xie with pity. He shook his head and sighed, \u201cHis life is in no danger, but as for the rest, they are in a horrible state.\u201d\u201cHorrible?\u201d Grandpa Jun was shocked. \u201cHow horrible?\u201d\u201cStagnant meridians, with faint signs of overexertion, his internal organs are also damaged, this\u2026\u201d he sighed before raising his head, \u201cDid the Third Young Master undergo any intense strenuous exercise just before this? In addition, the intensity involved is one that exceeds what a person\u2019s body could handle!\u201dJun Zhan Tian felt a sense of foreboding as he replied, \u201cIndeed, he did that for about seven days. In fact, just a day before yesterday\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s the problem\u2026\u201d Fang Huisheng retracted his hands, his eyebrows wrinkling. \u201cThe human body can sometimes be deficient, and Third Young Master\u2019s body was originally weak, to begin with. With a weak body, even if one has the perseverance to endure a high-intensity physical training, how could the muscles and veins handle it? If it was only this hidden injury, all he needed to do was to stop training. With the proper lifestyle, he could be cured. However, right now, his chest suffered from an impact of over a hundred jin in strength due to the sword wound and the kicks from the assassins, which caused his internal organs to be damaged. The injury to his internal organs also aggravated the hidden injury from his training. Now that these two injuries have overlapped, how could he manage? That\u2019s not all. The worst part was that after being stabbed by the sword, his wound was not wrapped up in time, leading to the great loss of blood. For him to be alive right now is already a blessing\u2026\u201dHe shook his head and continued, \u201cAfter such an incident, for Third Young Master to successfully preserve his life and returned to the state of an ordinary person is something to be highly grateful for. Also, if he ever partakes in any intense activities in the future, he would suffer from nausea and painful agony which could endanger his life.\u201dJun Zhan Tian\u2019s face turned blank and pale. \u201cIt is that bad? Does the Divine Doctor have any methods to restore him? Is there absolutely no hope for him at all?\u201dFang Hui Sheng gave a sigh and said, \u201cI can only tell you the same thing. The human body is sometimes deficient. Even though I am regarded as the Divine Doctor, I don\u2019t have divine skills. Now that all these injuries have come together, I fear that even an immortal could do anything about it. Old Jun, you wish for your grandson to become a dragon, but that is what everyone wishes as well. No matter how earnest your desires are, one must know one\u2019s limitations.\u201dAs he spoke, he began writing down a prescription. \u201cFollow this recipe as stated and prepare it for him three times a day. Prepare it carefully and he might recover a bit. As for his Xuan Qi cultivation, I believe that is no longer an option.\u201dGrandpa Jun was stunned. Even Tang Yuan who was standing beside had a stunned expression.However, who dares to doubt the words of the Divine Doctor? Who would have the qualifications to doubt him?Jun Zhan Tian forced himself to smile, his face darkened, \u201cIf he can preserve his life without suffering from any disability and live on like an ordinary person, that is good enough. As for Xuan Qi\u2026 there are many other people within the Tian Xiang Kingdom that have no knowledge of Xuan Qi, however, they could still contribute.\u201dDespite saying that, the disappointment in Grandpa Jun\u2019s voice was clear, even to Tang Yuan.Tang Yuan tried to comfort him, \u201cThat is true. Just look at our Imperial Court\u2019s Grand Preceptor, isn\u2019t he just a frail scholar? However, he could still dominate the Imperial Court, standing below one and above millions.\u201dTang Yuan\u2019s words had good intentions. However, listening to those words caused Grandpa Jun to become furious, thinking that Fatty was indirectly scolding him. Back then, Grand Preceptor Li\u2019s Xuan Qi cultivation was personally destroyed by Jun Zhan Tian. That incident was the root cause of the enmity between these two families, a feud that could never be resolved\u2026\u201cGet out!\u201d Grandpa Jun roared out in anger.Grandpa Jun\u2019s roar caused Fatty Tang to tremble and ran off, nearly sh*tting himself as he did. Even then, he did not comprehend what made Grandpa Jun so mad. He was clearly only trying to support Grandpa Jun\u2019s words.Fang Hui Sheng sighed. He packed up his chest preparing to leave. Grandpa Jun arranged for a few bodyguards to send him back while he himself sat down beside his grandson\u2019s bed.His actions caused the Divine Doctor Fang to feel somewhat displeased, \u201cWhat a huge difference in treatment before I came and after!\u201dWhen Grandpa Jun turned around, he found Jun Mo Xie smiling. He sighed and said angrily, \u201cWhat are you smiling at you brat? This senior spent so much effort to invite an expert tracker to protect you. Instead, you decided to be a smart aleck and used some methods to get rid of him. Now, look at you! Tell me\u2026 what should I say to you now! Sigh!\u201dGrandpa Jun shook his head and sighed. He felt that his lifetime\u2019s worth of sighs had all been used up today.\u201cGrandpa, please be at ease,\u201d Watching Jun Zhan Tian\u2019s face frowning due to concern, Jun Mo Xie felt his heart turning warm and could not bear to hide it from him any longer. \u201cThe diagnosis from Sir Fang earlier was simply a result of me tampering with my pulse. Honestly, the state of my body is nowhere near as bad as what he had described.\u201d Having said that, he activated his body\u2019s Xuan skill and his sickly face was suddenly replaced with a radiant complexion.\u201cEh?\u201d Jun Zhan Tian was startled and became elated. However, before the expression of ecstasy could spread over his entire face, a look of doubt appeared, followed by a look of realization.\u201cI want to hear all your reasons! I want to hear every single one, and even\u2026 your plans,\u201d Jun Zhan Tian\u2019s gaze turned sharp as he stared at Jun Mo Xie, as though he was trying to examine this grandson of his and what he was thinking of doing. Jun Zhan Tian immediately turned around and shouted. \u201cFrom this day onwards, I forbid anything that has ears to enter within thirty zhangs (91.2 m) from this room! Anyone disobeys, I will kill without mercy!\u201dA sound of affirmation came from the outside. Following which the sounds 'shua shua\u201d could be heard in succession.In just a while, the outside had turned silent, not a sound could be heard.Hiding the truth from the Imperial Doctor meant fooling the Emperor! Thus, Jun Zhan Tian was being extremely careful!Jun Mo Xie who had been lying flat on the bed suddenly sat up. Wearing only his pyjamas, he tightened his cloth belt and walked off the bed. He sat down on the chair in the room, his faced Jun Zhan Tian who was seated in front of him.This action from him caused Grandpa Jun to become surprised. It would appear that Jun Moxie\u2019s body has indeed fully recovered. This grandson of his had some good techniques. He even managed to fool the great Divine Doctor Fang!However, Grandpa Jun\u2019s face turned solemn. He could feel that what Jun Mo Xie planned to say would inevitably be something very serious. It might be something that he had no desire to listen to; it could even be something ridiculous! Thus, Grandpa Jun planned to prevent any possible leakage in information. As of now, the only one that could eavesdrop on them without being detected by Grandpa Jun would be the legendary Supreme Divine Xuan expert.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euJudging by how long his grandson had hidden his competencies and how he had faked his injuries, Grandpa Jun could sniff out the unusual atmosphere that was brewing. He felt that he could even guess what it was that his grandson was going to say, causing him to become particularly serious.\u201cAs of now, our Jun Family is in a really dangerous spot! Thus, I had no choice but to step up. Otherwise, I would have followed my original plans of living the rest of my life as a prodigal debauchee!\u201d Jun Mo Xie spoke. His first move was to \u2018slap\u2019 himself in the face. \u201cUnfortunately, I am now the only one left in the third generation of the Jun Family. Even if I don\u2019t wish to enter the stage, I no longer have that choice. As such, I must not allow myself to garner the attention of the great families or their precautionary measures!\u201d\u201cThis much I can comprehend. It is also one which I have already inferred,\u201d Grandpa Jun stroked his beard, \u201cOn this point alone, your action of faking your injuries has been very successful. I am also very pleased with that.\u201d\u201cIn addition, there was the previous action that grandpa took. In one night, you shocked all the great families within the capital city. But by doing so, our Jun Family\u2019s forces have been revealed. Regardless of whether it is your power in the Court or the military or even in terms of hidden forces, they are all much too powerful. Such a kind of power is not something that the Imperial Family would tolerate. Also, your actions were tantamount to a great crime! However, it just so happened that your actions complemented His Majesty\u2019s plans, leading to His Majesty yielding on that in order to complete his plans to reshuffle the balance of power within the capital. Secondly, His Majesty was probably taking into account of the past friendship between you two and your countless contributions to the Kingdom. Thirdly, grandpa is already old while Third Uncle is paralyzed. As for this grandson of yours, I am but a worthless debauchee. All this allowed His Majesty to not feel weary of you.\u201d\u201cHowever, this is something that could only happen once and never again. We are already pushing our luck with this, the next time we may not be so lucky! If His Majesty were to find out that grandson\u2019s debauchery ways are but an act; or if His Majesty were to find out that the news of my heavy injuries was fake, then the suspicion within his heart would increase. This would cause a calamity to descend upon our Jun Family! This is the biggest reason for me to fake my injuries!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was despondent and overwhelmed with despair for the events that happened in the past few days. Initially, he had wished to die with all of these people but His Majesty stopped him. Coupled with the safe return of his grandson, Jun Zhan Tian was already gradually feeling more positive. Even if everything had gone according to His Majesty\u2019s wishes, any of the other great families would have been obliterated by now if not for the Jun Family! In hindsight, it was truly a precarious and terrifying moment.\u201cGrandfather, your unwavering loyalty to the Imperial Family cannot be questioned, but that is only you,\u201d Jun Mo Xie said. \u201cAlthough the Jun Family seems to be capable of controlling the entire world, in reality, our family power only depends on a single Imperial Decree from the Emperor! With just one decree, our family could be erased in an instant! I am not used to this, and I believe neither will Third Uncle be too!\u201d\u201cI have never fancied the notion of placing my own fate in the hands of others. This is why I would rather be a free wanderer for the rest of my life. However, since my life as a wanderer has now been forced to cease, there is a need for change, and the premise for this change is\u2026is to hold the fate of the Jun Family completely within my own hands!\u201d Jun Mo Xie looked genuinely at Jun Zhan Tian. \u201cThis is my greatest aim and my ultimate intention, and even more so the cardinal tenet that governs all my actions!\u201d\u201cTo place our family\u2019s fate within your own hands? This is a rebellious thought!\u201d Jun Zhan Tian shuddered and stared fiercely at Jun Mo Xie.\u201cGrandfather, you have misunderstood me. In my opinion, those who strive to become the Emperor or have already become Emperors are all fools. In fact, those who seek to become upright and renowned Emperors are fools amongst fools!\u201d Jun Mo Xie scoffed. \u201cEven if I can control the whole world, become the lord of all men and have a thousand beautiful women by my side, they are all meaningless to me. I am not interested in these at all.\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Jun Zhan Tian\u2019s chest heaved up and down heavily, his white beard scattered messily by the wind. As a man who was nonpareil in his loyalty to the king, these words were utter insults to his most revered superior! If the one speaking had been someone else, the person would have been killed dozens of times!\u201cGrandpa, an honest man does not hide things, today I shall speak my mind! His Majesty would never allow the Jun Family to possess the great power or any exceptionally skilled descendants! Allowing them to rise to power would only threaten the Emperor\u2019s throne! One day, I will find out the true reasons behind the deaths of my father, Second Uncle and my two brothers. If there is any conspiracy behind their deaths, I will certainly demand justice from whoever involved!\u201d Jun Mo Xie asserted calmly. \u201cSince I have already admitted that I am Jun Mo Xie, I must at least do something for this family; This matter is probably the biggest wound in the Jun Family\u2019s history.\u201dJun Zhan Tian gave a long sigh. He ruminated for a moment before standing up and answering. \u201cBack when the First Emperor was laying the foundations of Tianxiang Empire, he deliberately moved several powerful families into Tianxiang City and conferred them potent positions and nobility. There were two benefits behind this move: Firstly, it is easier to control the great families when they are grouped together. Secondly, the great families would act as mutual restrains for one another, creating a balance of power amongst the greatest families. With this system in place, the Imperial Family would then be able to instill order and control the greater picture.\u201d\u201cWith the exception of the Ye Family that was removed years ago, the powerful families in Tianxiang City currently includes the Jun Family, Li Family, Dugu Family, Murong Family and Tang Family. Each family is located in different segments of the city and each held a mutual understanding of non-violence. In recent years, there was also the addition of the Meng and Song Families. But upon closer inspection, one would realize that these two are actually over-glorified clowns. Their capabilities are nowhere near the existing families that have been around since the establishment of the Empire.\u201d\u201cMilitary affairs are under the charge of the Jun Family and the Dugu Family. Although the Murong Family is currently trying to meddle with military powers, they will never succeed as long as Dugu Family and I exist! On the other hand. the Li and Meng Families continue to be our greatest rivals. They are always finding ways to subjugate our power. In addition, there are also some marriages between these two families. Among the new generation of the Li Family, there emerged a young man of exceptional talent, Li Youran! This increased the threat posed to us.\u201d\u201cOn the other hand, the Song Family have always maintained a low profile and can be ignored for now. In terms of military affairs, our family and Dugu Family have always been competing against one another and having arguments every other day. Dugu Zongheng has always been unhappy with me. However, this is not the main point. Although our families serve to keep one another in check, we share the same loyalty towards the Imperial Family. We would never truly go all out against each other. This is something you must remember. This is also the main reason why the Jun Family could survive this long in the Imperial Court!\u201d\u201cAmong the various great families, the Murong Family is the most ambitious. This is something that must be guarded against, but not necessary to act upon.\u201d\u201cEach of these families has their own intentions. Until the day His Majesty chooses to change the entire structure and reshuffle the balance of power within Tianxiang Empire, the great families will remain safe and protected. This is something that all the great families have understood.\u201d\u201cCurrently, we are at a moment where members of the younger generation like you start interacting with one another and causing mischief. The adults would only observe the exchanges and interactions from afar but at the same time, we are also noting down who are the more capable and threatening ones among the younger generation. I am very pleased that you are able to understand this.\u201dJun Zhan Tian had deliberately shifted away from the subject of the deaths of the two generations of Jun Family members. Instead, he decided to share an analysis of the current political situation within the city.\u201cThree years ago, His Majesty had planned to appoint a Crown Prince. But after a series of trials and tests, His Majesty had decided to forgo the plan. Instead, he wanted to let the three Princes compete against one another while he observes from behind the scenes. His Majesty believed that his three sons are all wolves! In the competition among these three wolves, there will be one eventual winner. This winner would then become His Majesty\u2019s successor.\u201dJun Mo Xie sneered but chose not to utter a word.Jun Zhan Tian gave a bitter smile and shook his head, \u201cHowever, a wolf is still a wolf. It can never transform into a tiger nor a dragon! Even if it becomes the leader of the pack, it will still function in the way of the wolves! Unfortunately, His Majesty does not have any other suitable candidates. Hence he could only force them and pressurize them but at the same time, deter, tame and groom them!\u201d\u201cThe cunning old foxes from each of the great families have probably noticed this situation. For the sake of their family, they will not participate in the political struggle between the Princes. However, each family will still have some individuals who will get close to the Princes. These people help to balance the power behind the scenes!\u201d\u201cCurrently, the only ones without any involvement with the three Princes are the Jun Family, Dugu Family, and the Li Family.\u201dJun Zhan Tian\u2019s words seemed inexplicably unrelated to what Jun Mo Xie had said earlier. He seemed to be talking to himself and yet seemingly directing his words at Jun Mo Xie. Finally, he concluded. \u201cHence, as long as you understand what you are doing and do not go too far, I will support you. Just go ahead and do what you must.\u201dAfter speaking, Jun Zhan Tian stood up with a somewhat lethargic look. \u201cI am already old. I can only watch you from afar. Your Third Uncle\u2019s body is also crippled. Jun Family will all depend on your actions. No matter what happens, as long as the Jun Family does not fall into an irrevocable state of destruction, it is enough!\u201dA sparkle appeared in Jun Mo Xie\u2019s eyes. He had astutely captured the meaning behind Jun Zhan Tian\u2019s words: \u201cDo what you must.\u201d These were insightful and significant words.\u201cNo wonder he gave me such a detailed analysis of the situation within the capital. It turns out that the main message he wished to convey was encapsulated in these words. This statement practically meant that I am free to do whatever I want while the Jun Family will support me and not interfere. However, if something goes beyond control, they will pull me out of it\u2026\u201d\u201cHowever, why did he hesitate when he mentioned Third Uncle\u2019s disability? The reason will be revealed shortly\u2026\u201dJun Zhan Tian\u2019s face showed a look of comfort as he looked at his grandson. \u201cAs for your Third Uncle\u2019s legs, if you can find a method of healing it, please do so quickly. Regardless of the outcome, just do not delay any longer. If you keep delaying, not only your Third Uncle will be anxious, someone else would even be more anxious.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe next moment, Jun Zhan Tian glared at him with large fiery eyes and chided. \u201cYou two! Do you really think I am stupid? You are my grandson, that is my son, and this is the Jun Family\u2019s Residence! Do you think you can even hide this from me? What a joke!\u201d\u201cErrr\u2026\u201d Jun Mo Xie felt somewhat awkward. Rubbing his nose, he explained. \u201cI was just worried that if this fails again, you would become disappointed once again. That would be undesirable.\u201d\u201cI was never hopeful about this matter at all!\u201d Jun Zhan Tian glared angrily, his words striking hard against Jun Mo Xie.\u201cIn the event that you actually succeeded in curing him, do you think I would be foolish enough to announce it to the whole world? If I were to do that, won\u2019t everyone start turning their attention towards you two, plotting conspiracies after conspiracies to harm you? If you dare to hide anything from me again, I will beat you till you are sore all over! I will make sure that you can\u2019t even crawl or walk out of the door!\u201d\u201cUhh\u2026\u201d Jun Mo Xie replied softly as he looked at his grandfather in a daze.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Observing the face of Jun Zhan Tian, the servants figured that Jun Mo Xie would never recover or be much more than a cripple. Otherwise, why would Jun Zhan Tian\u2019s face be as black as soot?Tang Yuan returned home and recounted all the details of this trip to Tang Wan Li, who sighed heavily and thought, \u201cI would never have imagined that a mighty military family like the Juns, once full of celebrated generals, would fall to this state. It is indeed a tragedy that their last descendant has no choice but to lead the life of a mere civilian.\u201dWith much hemming and hawing, Tang Yuan told Tang Wan Li about Jun Zhan Tian\u2019s sudden burst of anger. Sure enough, Tang Wan Li, too, burst out in anger, exclaiming, \u201cYou idiot! You have no idea what kind of jerk Li Shang is! It was precisely because Jun Zhan Tian broke that old fart\u2019s dantian that year that we\u2026 argh! Scram!\u201dRealising that his bootlicking was only going to get him into further trouble, Tang Yuan quickly scampered away.Within a day, news about Jun Mo Xie spread throughout the entire capital.Awhile ago, in the capital, there had already been a few rumours that Jun Mo Xie, the Jun family\u2019s hedonistic young master, had turned over a new leaf and was starting to sharpen his martial art skills. However, the leaders of the other families were shocked to hear these rumours. Some even conducted secret investigations to confirm whether these rumours were actually true, tracking Jun Mo Xie\u2019s past movements. Of course, they were not actually scared of Jun Mo Xie, who was simply a weak young man. Rather, what scared them was the possibility that the Jun family would have a capable successor, helping the family to once again gain power and prominence. That would be terrible for the other families.And today, as the \u201ctragic\u201d news began to spread, many people sighed with relief, even turning the news into a joke. They laughed at mealtimes about how a useless heir had tried to mend his ways and begin strict training, only to sustain crippling injuries due to overexertion after a few days. At least before he trained he had some Xuan Qi to speak of, but now he was completely crippled. What in the world could be more comical than that?This time, no one doubted the credibility of the news either, as it came directly from two extremely trustworthy sources. One was Jun Mo Xie\u2019s ride-or-die friend, Tang Yuan, who personally saw the crippled state of his dear friend. The other was the Imperial Doctor Fang Hui Sheng, who had personally diagnosed Jun Mo Xie\u2019s condition and declared it beyond recovery.Nobody would dare to doubt the news. Those who did were simply making things difficult for themselves. The nobility knew how skilled Fang Hui Sheng was in treating injuries and illnesses. Almost every one of them had once experienced it for themselves. Cultivating an excellent relationship with Fang Hui Sheng would ensure that they could look to him for medical treatment when needed. This was akin to gaining another life!Anyone who dared to express their doubt regarding Fang Hui Sheng\u2019s diagnosis would incur the wrath of the public. They would drown in others\u2019 spit within half a day.Nobody imagined that trickery was involved either. As a matter of fact, even Jun Zhan Tian would not be able to trick Fang Hui Sheng, let alone Jun Mo Xie who had such little Xuan Qi to begin with.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that Jun Mo Xie would become like this. Something seems off.\u201d Li Youran said, as he stood in Li Sheng\u2019s residence. With a slight frown, he said \u201cLi Feng, are you completely sure that this piece of news actually came from Fang Hui Sheng?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m certain that it came from Fang Hui Sheng!\u201d Li Shang said in a weak, aged voice, as he walked in falteringly. He looked at his grandsons with pleasure written all over his face. He thought, \u201cJun Zhan Tian, you old bull, even your strength can\u2019t help you now! The Jun family is set to deteriorate and even the gods couldn\u2019t change that. You want Jun Mo Xie, a useless idiot, to become a civil servant in the imperial court? Even if he were exceedingly talented, do you think I would let him rise to power? You should know, the entire imperial court falls under the control of my faction.\u201dWith a laugh, Li Youran said, \u201cSince Grandpa is so sure, the Jun family is no longer a threat to us.\u201dLi Shang nodded in agreement, but warned, \u201cThat\u2019s still in the future. For now, we should continue staying out of Jun Zhan Tian\u2019s way. He\u2019s old but he can still go berserk and kill a lot of people!\u201d As he spoke, he gave a cautionary look to Li Youran.Previously, Li Youran had been kicked and slapped by Jun Zhan Tian in public. Although Li Shang knew that his grandson could restrain himself very well, he also knew that his grandson was extremely vengeful. Li Youran might not reveal it, but he would never forget about this incident, and if given the chance, would definitely take revenge on Jun Zhan Tian! In warning Li Youran about Jun Zhan Tian, Li Shang was trying to persuade Li Youran to give up on revenge.After all, Jun Zhan Tian had already been driven to the point where he was literally a deranged lion. No one would dare to further provoke him, especially so since he had the protection of the Emperor. Furthermore, last night, he had displayed his real, unrevealed strength during the rampage that he had gone on, surprising everyone. Any family which had the nerve to challenge him directly would be utterly crushed and decimated by his overpowering strength. Jun Zhan Tian could even totally wipe out some of the weaker families belonging to the Major families. He was not someone to mess around with.Li Youran smiled and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry Grandfather. I won\u2019t do such a thing, I\u2019m not that reckless. However, it\u2019s fine if I trifle with Jun Mo Xie, right? Someone who just lost their Xuan Qi will probably be drinking away their sorrows. Furthermore, Grandfather, I guess you and Jun Zhan Tian probably won\u2019t care too much about the affairs of the younger generation, right?\u201dWith indifference in his eyes, Li Shang smiled and said, \u201cJust don\u2019t cross the line.\u201dHis four grandsons agreed in unison.\u2026Inside the Imperial Palace, the Emperor leaned back into the throne, his back propped up by a soft cushion. With a calm countenance and slightly squinted eyes, he looked at Fang Hui Sheng, who was standing in front of him respectfully.After a long silence, the Emperor finally asked, \u201cSo\u2026 did Jun Mo Xie really become\u2026 ?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness. Based on what I saw, there is definitely no faking it.\u201d Fang Hui Sheng replied confidently. Brushing his beard out of habit, he continued, \u201cJun Mo Xie has always behaved improperly, running amok and committing outrages. However, if he were to mend his ways and become an honest, sincere citizen, it could still be considered a blessing for the capital.\u201d\u201cA blessing for the capital, huh? Hahaha\u2026\u201d the Emperor laughed mildly and closed his eyes gently.\u201cThen, I shall take my leave.\u201d Fang Hui Sheng bowed deeply and left the palace.After Fang Hui Sheng left, the corner of the Emperor\u2019s mouth turned up ever so slightly, revealing his relief.As of now, Jun Zhan Tian was as good as on a three-month-long holiday. To an outsider, Jun Zhan Tian seemed to have changed his temperament considerably. He seemed to be rather downhearted and discouraged after what happened. He took a series of actions which many felt were out of the norm, even bordering on outrageous. Even the Emperor took the trouble to specifically send someone to express his condolences to Jun Zhan Tian.For example:Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOn a random day, Jun Zhan Tian walked out and flew into a sudden rage, shouting, \u201cWhy are there so many trees in this area? Cut them all down! The weather\u2019s turning cold and I can\u2019t even see the sun! What kind of nonsense is this?\u201dAs such, because of his order, an area of about five to six li in circumference around the Jun family\u2019s residence became a flat piece of smooth ground, completely barren of life.Another time, Jun Zhan Tian looked at the perimeter walls and shouted in anger, \u201cThese walls are so short, we might as well allow thieves to walk through our front gate as they please! Make them taller!\u201d As such, his men worked overnight to double the height of the originally twenty-foot tall walls. Furthermore, out of the blue, Jun Zhan Tian also ordered for at least five-feet of thistles and thorns to be placed at the top of the walls. Even a bird would not dare to perch on top of these walls.Furthermore, as if he were growing disdainful of his crippled grandson, or had gotten addicted to starting large construction projects, Jun Zhan Tian actually split his courtyard into three smaller ones. Each was surrounded by the same high walls on all perimeters, and Jun Mo Xie was locked up within one of the courtyards. The two adjacent courtyards were given to Jun Wu Yi, who had the left one, and Guan Qing Han, who had the right one.The two extra courtyards were extremely useless and took up more than half of the Jun family\u2019s residence. Jun Zhan Tian lived alone in the other half, from which occasionally, the sound of something being shattered would resonate. The servants of the house could only quietly tremble in fear, and even passers-by would lower their voices.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Jun WuYi took a small sip, and then closed his eyes feeling intoxicated, in the next corner, four muscular martial artists wielding iron hammers, pulling the bellows doing blacksmithing, fiery flames turning silver white in color, letting the metal piece inside burn to a crimson, then taking\u00a0it out, while their nose sniffs the air fill with the fragrance of the wine, their arms hammering away, their body fill with sweat, but the metal piece doesn\u2019t seem to have any changes occurring to it, its hardness reach unimaginable proportionYoung master said, as long as we hammer this piece of metal to a state that is to his satisfaction, everyone will be rewarded a pot of wine! Gosh, this fine wine, not even the emperor should have tasted it! just this alone allows the four drunkards put their life on the line for their work!peerless wine? this is just childs play, unless we have to, drinking that damn liquor you call wine everyday is really unbearable! Jun Moye drinks his wine elegantly, closed his eyes, and with interest said third uncle, it is said that the first time grandpa drank this wine, he got drunk?I heard\u2026 he did get drunk, Jun Wuyi frown and said, don\u2019t talk behind your elders back!uh,,,, Moye rubbed his nose, enjoying the moment,\u00a0not backing down, he asked, when gramps got drunk, it is said that he also started singing? and he also stick his head in a pan of cooked pork head?damn brat! looking for a beating? why don\u2019t you shut up about it, why didn\u2019t you say that this wine is this strong.

He sat upright and said, \u201cA person would only need this herb to heal blocked or damaged meridians. How could it be that at such a critical moment, someone else bought it? Could someone from our residence have released this information? Is someone trying to plot against us?\u201d\u201cI doubt so,\u201d Jun Wu Yi shook his head. \u201cOnly a few know that the Jun Family is looking for this herb, and even fewer know that this herb is for me. It is not possible for anyone to make the connection between our purchase of this herb and its importance in my recovery. Could it just be a mere coincidence? Or is heaven\u2019s will trying to prevent me from recovering?\u201dJun Mo Xie bit his lips as he paced back and forth with a frown on his face. If there was only one missing ingredient out of the five essential medicinal herbs, he could easily replace it with other combinations to concoct a medicine that was only slightly less effective. But if there were two missing ingredients\u2026\u201cThird Uncle, could you please order your men to find out who stole this herb from us?\u201d\u201cAn investigation on this case is already ongoing. However, this only occurred recently and it is still too early to distil more information on the buyer.\u201d Jun Wu Yi smiled. He appeared calm and even comforted Jun Mo Xie, \u201cI have been waiting for so many years. It does not matter even if my recovery is delayed for a few more months. Fear not, all is well.\u201dJun Mo Xie\u2019s face turned serious as he raised his cup to sip his wine. He was deep in thought, but the more he contemplated, the more perplexed the problem seemed. Noticing his nephew deeply immersed in thought, Jun Wu Yi decided to leave him alone and continued to enjoy his wine.The next instant, approaching footsteps broke the tranquillity in the room. A smile flashed across Jun Wu Yi\u2019s face as he heard the familiar footsteps.Donned in a stunning white dress, Guan Qing Han entered the room gracefully. She resembled a delicate snowflake, gently floating into the room in an elegant manner. However, as she approached Jun Mo Xie, he felt a strong pressure weighing down on him, as though a massive iceberg was slowly crushing him. Although she appeared gentle, a cold, bone-chilling aura emanated from her.Despite her beautiful looks and her charming dress, many would have thought that her heart had also turned cold long ago.Jun Mo Xie had protested against Guan Qing Han\u2019s sparring challenge request on many occasions but to no avail. Jun Mo Xie knew where he stood in terms of fighting abilities. All he lacked was only in strength, but in terms of killing techniques, he was second to none in the world!However, his grandfather, Jun Zhan Tian, was unaware of this fact as Jun Mo Xie wanted to keep this a secret. As such, Jun Zhan Tian had rejected Jun Mo Xie\u2019s protest firmly. Especially after witnessing the \u201cabusive\u201d nature of Guan Qing Han\u2019s moves, Jun Zhan Tian had only left a single remark.He said, \u201cI am very satisfied. Give no mercy and continue to beat him up!\u201dToday would be Wu Jun Yi\u2019s first time witnessing his nephew getting beaten up. In the past one month, his nephew had always been outwitting him, causing him much frustration. Jun Wu Yi had thus jumped on this opportunity to vent his frustration. After all, opportunities like this were always hard to come by.\u201cBut I really cannot fight!\u201d Jun Mo Yi sighed to himself.It was not that Jun Mo Xie was unable to fight, but that he did not dare to retaliate. Throughout his whole life, Jun Mo Xie\u2019s hands had always been stained with blood. Killing only took a split second, and he was highly proficient in it. However, during friendly sparring matches, not only will he be restricted from executing his killing techniques, even the basic moves to take down his opponents might cause the opponent to sustain severe injuries and therefore could not be used.Moreover, it was his sister-in-law challenging him to a duel! Although Guan Qing Han may dislike him, how could he possibly kill her? Of course, breaking her limbs were out of the picture. It was awkward enough to cause even minor dislocations to a woman.Furthermore, for a man to fight a woman, if they were not arch-enemies, it might be inappropriate to deal blows to certain parts of the body.Without using his vicious methods, Jun Mo Xie did not have many options in facing his opponent, especially someone like Guan Qing Han who had Xuan Qi level far exceeding his own. Even if his unparallelled fighting capabilities provided an advantage over his opponent, his tactical shrewdness alone would be unable to overcome the immense difference in strength.Guan Qing Han remained at her spot, quiet and motionless, resembling alone, snow lotus flower on an ice mountain. She appeared noble and elegant, yet at the same time, emotionless and cold.\u201cCan we not fight today?\u201d Jun Mo Xie asked pitifully and offered a compromise, \u201cI can give you two more pots of wine, how about that?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d Guan Qing Han rejected vehemently and gave Jun Mo Xie a cold glare. The next instant, she slapped her delicate hands together, releasing a black mist. It was the Level 9 Xuan Qi! \u201cAre you ready?\u201d Guan Qing Han gazed at Jun Mo Xie with a blank expression that lacked anger or joy, as though she was looking at a durable sandbag.\u201cPeh! Would you be as enthusiastic about the duel if not for the wine I am giving you? Is the God playing tricks on me? This woman is actually given a justifiable reason to beat me up! And I can\u2019t even retaliate! Ready? Is there any use in getting ready?\u201d Anger welled up in Jun Mo Xie.Jun Mo Xie\u2019s intention to conceal his true fighting potential naturally created a positive effect, which was to raise Jun Zhan Tian\u2019s hopes. However, this also had unintended repercussions. Having been kept in the dark for so long, Jun Zhan Tian will certainly be very unhappy. Hence, the duel with Guan Qing Han must have been a plot arranged by Jun Zhan Tian to teach Jun Mo Xie a lesson.Despite knowing all this plot, Jun Mo Xie could only keep all of this to himself. It was even more infuriating for the fact that while Jun Mo Xie obviously had many ways to defeat this woman, he had to restrain himself from using them.Jun Mo Xie could have easily resolved the situation, but instead, he had to put up with such constant abuse. Could he be a masochist? There was nothing more tragic than his current predicament. He wondered when Jun Zhan Tian would cease this punishment.\u201cIf I have to admit my mistake to Grandfather to end this misery, I will certainly apologize to Grandfather sincerely.\u201d\u201cIf it is possible to put an end to this punishment, I truly hope that it will end the very next second.\u201dAs Jun Mo Xie\u2019s imagination was running wild, a green light swirled before him. In an instant, a fist, white as snow, flew straight at Jun Mo Xie. Jun Mo Xie shrieked and ducked. But sadly, Quan Qing Han showed no mercy. She dealt blows after blows relentlessly and seemed eager to bring an end to this task so that she can quickly carry her two pots of wine back to enjoy.Although Jun Mo Xie\u2019s behavior and attitude had shown improvements recently, Guan Qing Han had absolutely no interest in spending a second longer with him in the fight.Squeals, screams, and cries of pain continued to fill the air. \u201cPa! Pa! Pa!\u201d Like rain pelting relentlessly on a soft vulnerable surface, kicks and punches landed continuously and mercilessly on Jun Mo Xie. Savouring his cup of wine, Jun Wu Yi watched as the scene unfolded before him. Seeing the great disparity in strength, and the unmatchable Guan Qing Han, he could not help but chuckled. He thought, \u201cJun Zhan Tian\u2019s plan to punish my errant nephew is truly a smart move.\u201dWhile Jun Wu Yi was thinking, his eyes suddenly narrowed, and his expression suddenly turned solemn. He fixed his gaze on Jun Mo Xie\u2019s moves so intently, to the extent that he did not even bother to place his cup down!A particular movement of Jun Mo Xie had drawn his attention!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euEarlier on, Guan Qing Han was intending to launch a seamless combination move involving a solid punch, followed very closely by a formidable roundhouse kick. Such a move was thought to be impossible to avoid. However, at that point in time, Jun Mo Xie\u2019s body twisted away instinctively and his elbow thrust out slightly before retracting again. The next instant, he was knocked to the ground by the full force of Guan Qing Han\u2019s combination move.This slight reaction was supposed to be inconsequential and hardly noticeable. But it could not escape the eyes of Jun Wu Yi, who was a highly skilled army general who had spent his entire life on the battlefield. The observation had been a shocking revelation to him!In the battlefield, a high emphasis was placed on taking down each enemy in one decisive move. Jun Wu Yi clearly noticed that Jun Mo Xie\u2019s instinctive elbow thrust, despite retracted, was undoubtedly aimed at Guan Qing Han\u2019s throat. It was a move to kill! Had Jun Mo Xie followed through with the move, Guan Qing Han would have been dead by now!More importantly, the execution of the elbow thrust was timed perfectly. It was placed exactly in the transition between Guan Qing Han\u2019s two moves where she was vulnerable for a fleeting moment. Guan Qing Han\u2019s cultivation was known to be unparalleled. The two moves had been administered in a nearly seamless motion, and the interval between them had been practically negligible. Nevertheless, Jun Mo Xie was still able to exploit the only flaw in Guan Qing Han\u2019s combination attack!At that moment, Guan Qing Han certainly stood no chance against Jun Mo Xie\u2019s unpredictable move!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, the throat was a vulnerable and weak point in the human body. At the same time, the elbow was an extremely effective weapon because it could withstand stress. If one struck the weakest part of one\u2019s opponent with the strongest part of one\u2019s own, it would definitely be possible to triumph over a stronger opponent. In this case, it only needed one hit to kill!A single move by Jun Mo Xie was sufficient to land a lethal blow!Jun Wu Yi was utterly shocked!Could Jun Mo Xie truly be so intelligent? Or was the entire event simply a coincidence? Jun Wu Yi cleared his thoughts and continued watching the duel before him with heightened concentration and close attention. He scrutinized every move that was executed and while it seemed that every single blow landed were direct hits to Jun Mo Xie, in Jun Wu Yi\u2019s eyes, an absolutely contrasting scene was unfolding! Each time Guan Qing Han\u2019s moves were about to find their targets on Jun Mo Xie, Jun Mo Xie would instinctively react with very slight gestures which he swiftly tried to retract. All of these small moves were positioned in such strategic manners that only a small amount of force would be sufficient to kill Guan Qing Han! Sometimes, this even happened more than once between Guan Qing Han\u2019s moves!Jun Wu Yi remained silent as he observed the match carefully.In the next move, Jun Mo Xie ducked right and had begun to shape his fingers into a fist with his middle knuckle protruded. Analyzing it closely would reveal that his fists were aimed straight at the back of Guan Qing Han\u2019s skull! This was yet another weak point of the human body!And in the subsequent move, Jun Mo Xie\u2019s knee bent at a sharp angle and exhibited a highly precise and swift movement. If he did not retract in time, his knee would have smashed straight into Guan Qing Han\u2019s groin, another fatal point of the human body!The heart!Temple!Spine!Following which, the eyes, throat, and ears\u2026In the meantime, Guan Qing Han appeared elated and excited about having the opportunity to thrash Jun Mo Xie, who was howling profusely and trying desperately to avoid her moves. On the other hand, Jun Wu Yi was already breaking out in cold sweat!Jun Wu Yi\u2019s was extremely worried about Guan Qing Han. Given his proficiency in reading moves, Jun Wu Yi\u2019s heart would skip a beat every few moves, for he could easily see the sheer danger Guan Qing Han was in. Little did Guan Qing Han know the sheer number of times she had encountered near-death experiences just in this duel alone. And there she was, still happily and eagerly trying to beat the life out of Jun Mo Xie without any clue of the peril that could befall her any moment!Jun Wu Yi was now fully aware of Jun Mo Xie\u2019s forceful suppression of his instinctive abilities and killing moves!But it was simply too terrifying! Despite being an Earth Xuan Qi expert, Jun Wu Yi knew he would hardly stand a chance against Jun Mo Xie.This was just too intimidating! As the saying goes, the on-looker would always see more clearly than those involved in the act. In this case, the on-looker was not only all-seeing but utterly scared out of his wits!Jun Wu Yi was too afraid to even interfere with this subtle game of death! He feared that even the slightest remark may cause Jun Mo Xie to inadvertently lose concentration of the duel and cause the accidental death of Guan Qing Han! Jun Mo Xie\u2019s movements were too fast and precise. Even if Jun Wu Yi\u2019s legs were working perfectly, he would still be unable to react fast enough to prevent any fatal accidents.Finally, Guan Qing Han decided to cease the thrashing after Jun Mo Xie had been knocked down about ten times. She had not uttered a single word from the start to the end. And without a word, she picked up the two pots of wine and headed back to her own courtyard, as though they were the reward for her victory. Throughout all this time, her face showed no sign of anger or joy, and her expression remained cold and blank. The fact that she did not even have a single bead of perspiration despite the intense duel showed that beating Jun Mo Xie up was an effortless task that hardly expended her energy. Surely, it was only reasonable to describe this duel as a match between a fighter with a high-level Xuan Qi and an inferior fighter!Jun Wu Yi was still reeling in shock as he stared blankly at Guan Qing Han\u2019s disappearing figure. Based on his analysis, if the fight had been a real battle of life and death, Guan Qing Han would have been killed at least 47 times! And during each of this encounter, Jun Mo Xie forcefully withdrew!These numbers were very frightening. How was it possible that Jun Mo Xie, a person at the Fourth Level of Xuan Qi, could gain complete control in a duel with Guan Qing Han, one who was already at the Ninth Level Xuan Qi and was about to break into the Silver Xuan Qi Realm!Will Jun Mo Xie be the first to defy the traditional norm where those of lower level Xuan Qi was unable to triumph over experts with higher level Xuan Qi?No, this was hardly a question. Jun Mo Xie had already proven otherwise! It was a fact now.And the terrifying part was that all of Jun Mo Xie\u2019s reactions were instinctive and subconscious, just that he had been able to consciously withdraw his strikes every single time. What did this imply? What did this reveal?Jun Wu Yi was entirely drenched in cold sweat.This showed that Jun Mo Xie was so familiar and refined in his killing techniques that it had become second nature to him!He would be able to attack instinctively without contemplation or hesitation, identifying and targeting his enemies\u2019 weakness with swift fatal blows.Killing was already an innate ability in Jun Mo Xie!This was the only explanation possible for the duel that transpired moments ago!How many people did he have to kill to perfect his killing technique with such precision?Even Jun Wu Yi himself, a former war veteran, was terrified to imagine any further. He had seen much blood and gore on the battlefield, experienced multiple assassinations attempts himself, and even raised his own assassins to serve him. But despite participating in countless wars, and killing many others himself, Jun Wu Yi had never seen such a formidable and intimidating character before.A monster!Every single move carried the intent to kill. Killing was deeply ingrained in his senses, and had become his first reaction to any stimulus!And this terrifying, cruel and demonic monster was no other than Jun Wu Yi\u2019s own nephew!Jun Mo Xie!Jun Wu Yi moaned and closed his eyes slowly. \u201cWhat on earth am I seeing? I must be dreaming! If this is a nightmare, please wake me up now!\u201dNightmare? If Jun Mo Xie could possess such powerful abilities, it might not necessarily be a nightmare, but potentially be a pleasant dream!All of a sudden, Jun Wu Yi remembered that Jun Mo Xie had begged Jun Zhan Tian to withdraw his orders for the duels by saying, \u201cGrandfather, I can\u2019t fight! It\u2019s true! I really can\u2019t fight!\u201dThe famous grandson of the General could not fight? Upon hearing this, Jun Zhan Tian\u2019s first reaction was to give Jun Mo Xie a harsh kick before pointing at the door, screaming, \u201cGet out!\u201dBack then, Jun Wu Yi could barely contain his laughter after hearing this. And for the longest time, he would be greatly amused whenever he recalled the event.Of course, he was unable to fight. But apart from interpreting it as an inability to fight, it could also be interpreted as\u2026And only till today did he truly comprehend what Jun Mo Xie meant all this while. Jun Mo Xie could never fight indeed. Because he could only kill!Such precise killing techniques were already ingrained in his blood, his soul, and every single inch of his bones, muscle, and nerves!If a soldier had such deadly skills, he would be able to confront a million troops alone. The bodies of his enemies would just pile into mountains!If an assassins had such deadly skills, they would have become legends instantly!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAnyone with such skills would be able to determine the life and death of others, like how the God of Death determine human fate.For someone at this level, killing had probably become a habit or an innate ability. It had already become a pinnacle of art and even a phenomenal accomplishment, just like how an expert artist could produce breathtaking art with a simple stroke of his brush, or a revered musician could synthesize seemingly magical melody with the flick of his finger.All warriors and assassins had aspired to achieve such capabilities, but nobody had ever achieved the pinnacle of killing. However, how did Jun Mo Xie, his own nephew, achieve this? How could it possibly be Jun Mo Xie?!Jun Wu Yi\u2019s mind was overwhelmed with questions. Where did Jun Mo Xie learn these skills from? How did he hone them to such precision? And most importantly? What did he use as his practice target?All of a sudden, Jun Wu Yi felt that his nephew was so obscure that he was unable to look into him. Although Jun Mo Xie was only at the Fourth Level of Xuan Qi cultivation currently, his performance alone just now already made Jun Wu Yi feel that he had to look up to his own nephew!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The injuries he sustained were insignificant to him and hardly worth mentioning. He would be fully recovered after running the Art of Unlocking Heaven\u2019s Fortune for a week. After all, Guan Qing Han would never harm him intentionally.Noticing something amiss, Jun Mo Xie looked up to find his Uncle, Jun Wu Yi staring at him with shock and disbelief. Jun Wu Yi was a former war veteran. But at that moment, his eyes contained traces of apprehension, surprise, and even awe.\u201cHow\u2026did you do it?\u201d Jun Wu Yi asked, his eyes wide with surprise. \u201cWho imparted you such skills? Is it someone who has attained the legendary Spirit Xuan?\u201dJun Mo Xie was stunned momentarily. As he slowly understood the situation, he suddenly broke into laughter. After a long pause, he raised his cup and drank the cup of wine in one motion.\u201cTo attain such terrifying abilities, one must have the heart of a killer!\u201d Jun Mo Xie smiled as he replied. \u201cThird Uncle, what you actually wish to know, is how many people I have killed to achieve my current state, am I right?\u201dSeeing Jun Wu Yi\u2019s expression, Jun Mo Xie understood that his astute Third Uncle had already seen through his instinctive reactions from the duel earlier on. Although Jun Mo Xie had suppressed them in a timely manner, traces of his innate abilities were still exposed. Lacking in experience, Guan Qing Han may have been fooled. But as an Earth Xuan expert and a former war veteran who was observing every move of the fight from a third person\u2019s perspective, Jun Wu Yi could not have missed it.Jun Wu Yi grunted and questioned his nephew in a strict tone, \u201cMo Xie, enemies may take each other lives on the battlefield but that is the course of nature. However, you were still able to pick up such effective killing techniques even without joining the army. How is this possible? There is no way you can attain such a high cultivation without staining your hands with the blood of others. Did you really\u2026\u201dAlthough trembling, Jun Wu Yi\u2019s voice was filled with anger, \u201cYou have always stayed within the Royal Capital\u2026Did you hone your skills by practicing them on civilians?\u201d\u201cThird Uncle, having experienced numerous life-threatening situations, how could you speak such absurd words? It is not necessary to slaughter others to perfect one\u2019s killing techniques.\u201d Jun Mo Xie said calmly. \u201cIn fact, as long as one truly familiarizes oneself with the human body: every bone, every joint and every nerve, then one would naturally be able to pick this up.\u201dJun Mo Xie narrowed his eyes and said, \u201cThe human body, regardless of gender, has two hundred and six bones. This means there are also two hundred and six joints all over the body. There are many vulnerable spots on the human body, especially above the thighs. A powerful blow to any of these places could easily take a person\u2019s life! Regardless of what move or technique a person is using, there would certainly be a vulnerable spot that is left completely defenseless!\u201d\u201cFighting requires movement of the bones and joints. While concentrating maximum force at some points of the body, some other parts will be left weak and defenseless, and these are the flaws! Once these flaws have been identified, the part that the person was previously concentrating on also becomes a flaw. With all these details of your enemy on the back of your hand, it would be effortless to find a countermeasure against him. I had always told Grandfather that I\u2019m unable to fight. The truth is, I\u2019m unable to fight because if I did fight, there would be only one result: Sister-in-law\u2019s death! In fact, she could have died countless times today, at least a hundred times! I wonder if Uncle managed to count all of them!\u201dSmiling proudly, Jun Mo Xie continued, \u201cI must admit that I\u2019ve become very used to striking only the weakest points in a human body and causing fatal blows. In this world, the best understanding of the human body is possessed by doctors. But Uncle, you would rarely see doctors who are killers because most of them only learn to heal patients and save lives!\u201dJun Wu Yi was speechless for a moment. He then said angrily, \u201cYou\u2019re just fabricating the truth!\u201dJun Mo Xie sighed and replied, \u201cUncle, you have watched me grow up from young. We may not have met often in the last two years, but Grandfather\u2019s spies were always following me every single day and every single moment. They record every action and information about me, including where I sleep every night. On top of that, they also gathered intel on the duration I spent with each woman, who the woman was, her family background and even her ancestry! Uncle, do you truly believe that I really could kill people secretly with all these people following me? Don\u2019t you think your theory is absolutely preposterous?\u201dJun Wu Yi could neither laugh nor cry. He was at a complete loss for words!\u201cCan a natural killer truly exist?\u201d Jun Wu Yi stammered. His mind was in a turmoil. Jun Mo Xie\u2019s word completely defied his general knowledge, throwing him into a state of confusion\u2026Jun Mo Xie quickly wiped the cold sweat from his brows as he breathed a long sigh of relief. \u201cOh my goodness! It was so close. It really isn\u2019t easy fooling Third Uncle!\u201d\u201cBut why are you so interested in killing techniques? Furthermore, you have become so proficient in it! The contrast between this and your identity\u2026is just too\u2026\u201d Jun Wu Yi seemed unconvinced as he continued to question his nephew.\u201cUncle, ever since I, Jun Mo Xie, entered this world, I have never killed anyone,\u201d Jun Mo Xie spoke innocently, his eyes flashing traces of loneliness and longing. Jun Mo Xie looked so sincere and genuine that anyone seeing him would have trusted him completely and taken his words as the absolute truth!And this was indeed the truth! When Jun Mo Xie said \u201cever since Jun Mo Xie entered this world\u201d, he was not referring to Jun Mo Xie but rather \u201cJun Xie\u201d, the \u201cEvil Monarch\u201d himself!Just then, the little loli maid walked in quietly and did a little curtsy bow before saying, \u201cThird Master, Young Master. Somebody is requesting to see you, Third Master. He said it is something urgent.\u201d While speaking, she noticed Jun Mo Xie covered in dirt and dust and felt sorry for him. \u201cPoor Young Master must have been abused again. Young Master has become very kind recently, he doesn\u2019t deserve such treatment!\u201dJun Mo Xie replied quickly, \u201cQuick, let him enter!\u201dFinally, someone had come to salvage the situation. He came just at the perfect moment!A short while later, a man dressed completely in black strode in at a steady pace. With shrewd eyes and a composed demeanor, an aura of energy and confidence radiated from him. Glancing at him, Jun Mo Xie could tell that this was a person of talent.\u201cGeneral, we have identified the person who bought the Nine Leaf Grass.\u201d\u201cWho is it?\u201d Jun Mo Xie and Jun Wu Yi asked simultaneously.\u201cHe is\u2026the Young Master of the Tang Family, Tang Yuan\u201d The man looked up at Jun Mo Xie before answering hesitantly.\u201cTang Yuan?\u201d Jun Mo Xie shouted in surprise and said, \u201cWhy on earth did Fatty Tang buy the Nine Leaf Grass? Is someone in the Tang Family in need of this herb as well?\u201d\u201cI\u2026I am not sure about this for now.\u201dJun Wu Yi and Jun Mo Xie stared at each other for a long while without uttering a word. The messenger took the cue and left the room quietly.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThe information could not have been leaked, could it?\u201d Jun Wu Yi wondered aloud.\u201cI suppose not!\u201d Jun Mo Xie replied confidently. But he frowned again, asking, \u201cBut why would Fatty Tang buy this herb? Its uses are so limited. It is really incomprehensible.\u201d Thinking for a moment, Jun Mo Xie asked, \u201cUncle, you once said that there were only three strands of this herb, right?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cThen all I need is to ask Fatty Tang to give us the remaining two strands of herb! Leave this to me!\u201d Jun Mo Xie was full of confidence. The priced jade and sword which Fatty Tang lost during the gambling bet were still in the hands of Jun Mo Xie. If Jun Mo Xie offered these items in exchange for the two strands of herb, he was pretty sure that Fatty Tang would instantly agree to the deal! This deal would be far too good for Fatty Tang!\u201cThis works too,\u201d Jun Wu Yi smiled while looking down at his crippled legs. Hints of excitement flashed across his eyes as he thought,\u201dWe are finally down to one last ingredient for the Blazing Heart Meridian!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was afraid that clumsy Fatty Tang might damage the herb if he were to delay any further. It would cost the Jun Family a lot of time and money if he had to personally search for the rare herb again, not to mention the mental turmoil and painstaking effort required to find it. Hence, the longer the delay, the higher chance of the troubles he had to face.Sitting in a sedan, Jun Mo Xie stretched and laid down. The sedan gradually approached the Tang Residence. When he came to the gate, he was greeted by the sight of a large round meatball-shaped person walking out from within the residence. Donned in a skin-colored gown, Tang Yuan, the Tang Family\u2019s young master, was truly dressed in a unique fashion today. Had the gown been smaller by several inches, he would have been easily mistaken as a meatball and be served on the dinner table!\u201cBrother, what brings you here today? Have you fully recovered from your injuries yet? You were probably too bored and that\u2019s why you came over wanting to play with me, right?\u201d Tang Yuan asked with a pleased look painted on his face. He sounded a little concerned, but his actions and words suggested sheer joy and sincerity!\u201cI am here to visit you,\u201d Jun Mo Xie peered out of his sedan window and continued, \u201cWhy, are you going somewhere else?\u201d\u201cYes! I\u2019m going to the Magnificent Jewel Hall to bid for some items! There are actually some good items on display today. Grandfather asked me to get one of those items.\u201d\u00a0Tang Yuan reached into his robes and pulled out a large stack of money, waving it in the air. He laughed heartily, his face resembling the shape of a Buddha. \u201cThis time around, I am being asked to spend. Look! Such a huge stack of money. After getting the item Grandfather requested for, there would certainly be a large amount remaining for me to spend on. Jun Mo Xie, shall we go to the Thousand Gold Hall to play a few games afterward?\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t use your wife as the mortgage again, right?\u201d Jun Mo Xie asked jokingly.\u201cHey, Jun Mo Xie, if you are my brother, don\u2019t mention such things again.\u201d Tang Yuan\u2019s large white face grew dark in annoyance. \u201cI was set up by others back then! If the game had been played under normal circumstances, I would already be known as the legendary Gambling God!\u201d\u201cI would rather believe in ghosts than to take in the words coming out from that broken mouth of yours!\u201d Jun Mo Xie snorted. The next moment, Jun Mo Xie turned serious again. Ignoring the pitiful look that appeared on Tang Yuan, Jun Mo Xie said directly, \u201cDon\u2019t rush off so soon eagerly. I have something important to ask you today.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Tell me all your worries!\u201d Tang Yuan asked as he watched Jun Mo Xie earnestly.\u201cI heard that you bought three strands of Nine Leaf Grass from Jin Xiang Trading Company. I need the Nine Leaf Grass very urgently as it is needed to cure my injury. Hand it over to me now!\u201d Jun Mo Xie demanded boldly from Tang Yuan.\u201cWho did you hear this from? I feel maligned! I have always been disgusted by those leaf, grass or herb-related items! Don\u2019t you know that?\u201d Tang Yuan said vehemently, his face flushing red.\u00a0\u201cSince when have I bought this herb? Be it Nine Leaf Grass or Seven Leaf Grass, I simply have no clue about it!\u201dJun Mo Xie\u2019s heart sank and continued to challenge his friend, \u201cTang Yuan, you have no clue about it? I came all the way here to ask you and yet you tell me you have no clue about it? Do you still want your priced jade and sword back? I shall throw them into the sewage pit the moment I get back!\u201d\u201cBut I really don\u2019t know what it is!\u201d Tang Yuan jumped in place anxiously. \u201cBrother, how would I dare to lie to you? If anyone dares to cheat you, they must be the stupidest and most foolish person ever\u2026Oh?\u00a0Jin Xiang Trading Company?\u201dAll of a sudden, Fatty Tang\u2019s eyes widened and he cried out, \u201cOh my goodness! Jun Mo Xie, did you just mention Jin Xiang Trading Company?\u201d\u201cYou are not deaf, are you?\u201d Jun Mo Xie snapped as he glared at Fatty Tang, wondering what he was up to again, even though Fatty Tang did not seem to be fooling with him.\u201cThat is one of the businesses owned by my family!\u201d Tang Yuan said, his cheeks puffed up and his eyes widened even more. \u201cI have only bought herbs once in my entire life, and it was bought for you! Just five days ago, I went to our very own Jin Xiang Trading Company drugstore to search for it, before sending it to the Jun Residence\u2026\u201dTang Yuan continued, \u201cAnd coincidentally, a new batch of stocks arrived at the store that day. I had no clue what those goods were, but according to the manager, those were high-quality goods. So I simply bought all of those products, stuffed them into crates, and sent them all to your place. If you\u2019re telling me that I actually bought this Nine Something Leaf, it would probably be in your house right now.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Upon hearing this, Jun Mo Xie\u2019s jaws dropped. \u201cDidn\u2019t you send some Hundred Jin Hoist or something that day?\u201d\u201cBrother, this isn\u2019t your fault. You are probably feeling very confused right now, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Tang Yuan blinked and continued, \u201cI sent you a lot of goods that day. In fact, the items were separated into two layers. The first layer contains traditional herbs such as ginseng, angelica and poria, and all of them were fresh and high-quality ones! Beneath them were all the genuinely good stuff! Before I could explain anything, I was chased out by your grandfather. I was even worried that these herbs may spoil because no one bothered to take a look at them. Brother, these are some valuable goods! I would not afford to give anyone else but you!\u201dAfter he finished, Fatty Tang concluded, \u201cTherefore, I don\u2019t have the herb, you have it!\u201dJun Mo Xie was so shocked that he almost fell right off the sedan. He paused for a long while before stammering, \u201cI\u2026have it?\u201dSuddenly, Jun Mo Xie was no longer interested in pursuing Tang Yuan. He wanted to get home as soon as possible to verify Tang Yuan\u2019s words. If the herbs really did spoil just like Tang Yuan had described, it would be too unfortunate! This Fatty Tang was sure causing much trouble!Tang Yuan pulled a long face and asked, \u201cWhat is with all this anxiety? You\u2019ve only just recovered from your injuries. It\u2019s such a rare opportunity for you to be out. Let\u2019s go to the Magnificent Jewel Hall together. I heard that they have a lot of good things on auction today! We can go bid on all the good stuff together!\u201d Fatty then pulled out a sheet of paper and flipped through the lists of items. Pointing at the contents, he squealed excitedly, \u201cLook here! Jade ornaments, jade glass flowers, seabed jade coral\u2026they are all rare and valuable goods!\u201cI don\u2019t have time to play with you!\u201d Jun Mo Xie withdrew into his sedan chair. But as he said those words, he turned back and watched Tang Yuan indecisively, and suddenly changed his mind. \u201cSure! Let\u2019s just take a look! We shall both catch some good deals together!\u201dJun Mo Xie then ordered one of his guards to head home immediately to request Jun Wu Yi to empty those two crates of items and carefully organize all of them. At the same time, he instructed the guard to bring more money for him to spend at the Magnificent Jewel Hall.Jun Mo Xie sudden change of mind was due to him spotting a particular item on Tang Yuan\u2019s list of items: Blazing Heart Meridian!\u201cHoly! I can\u2019t believe I am so lucky! It all came too easily!\u201d Jun Mo Xie was so excited that he could hardly contain himself.The Magnificent Jewel Hall.It was a place which could bring hysteria to almost all of Tian Xiang Empire\u2019s richest nobles, and one which provided goods with quality worthy enough for their tastes.This was the largest auction house in Tian Xiang Empire, but it was more than just a simple auction house.Apart from finding the best treasures in the entire empire, it also offered almost any other item anyone needed. Whatever treasure one could think of, it would certainly be there!As long as one had sufficient money, one could even control ghosts or speak to gods!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThese statements, regardless of the past or present, would always hold true!Food, drinks, entertainment, lethal weapons, robbing tools, beasts\u2019 hides, power strengthening pills, powerful magic instruments, high-quality decorations and even male and female slaves\u2026It was simply too plentiful and abundant! A cornucopia of goods which offered only the unimaginable, and nothing unattainable!Regardless of how luxurious and wealthy one\u2019s life used to be, one would realize how lacking it was upon entering the Magnificent Jewel Hall! One would realize that there were actually so many things that they had yet to try!

It was a place solely reserved for those in the upper echelons of society. Before entering, even purses had to be assessed on whether they are sufficiently packed.Nobody knew when the Magnificent Jewel Hall was established or who established it. Nobody knew who ran the business behind the scenes, or which powerful country or clan it belonged to.The Magnificent Jewel Hall had existed since the time the Tian Xiang Empire was established. It had survived numerous wars, and lived through many dynasties. Many emperors and warlords had long been forgotten and buried in history, but the Magnificent Jewel Hall remained, and even continued to prosper!All those who once attempted to interfere with the Magnificent Jewel Hall had already turned to dusts and been forgotten, regardless of whether they were powerful nobles, wealthy businessmen, or formidable swordsmen.Even members of the royal family in Tian Xiang Empire had to maintain their ego and follow the rules obediently at the Magnificent Jewel Hall. This was the kind of place which Jun Mo Xie hated going most in the past. But today, it was the place which he was most curious about!\u201cIf I could set this place on fire, it must be really exciting, won\u2019t it?\u201d An evil thought appeared on his mind as Jun Mo Xie sat on his sedan chair comfortably. As a general\u2019s son, bullying ordinary citizens would earn him nothing but the hatred of the ordinary population. The real excitement could only be found in triggering the royalties and elites concentrated in this place!\u201cThe Magnificent Jewel Hall? A suitable place indeed! Haha!\u201d Jun Mo Xie laughed in his heart. \u201cPerhaps I should pass for now and wait till I regain my strength before coming back!\u201dJun Mo Xie had been audacious and fearless in both his previous and current lives. There was truly nothing else he was afraid of commiting. No matter how exceptional the Magnificent Jewel Hall was, it was still an ordinary auction house in the eyes of Jun Mo Xie.In order to keep up with Jun Mo Xie, Tang Yuan had deliberately chosen a well built horse to travel alongside Jun Mo Xie\u2019s sedan, occasionally turning to say a few words to Jun Mo Xie. Just as they were approaching the Magnificent Jewel Hall, Tang Yuan suddenly had an unusual realisation, \u201cJun Mo Xie, you see, I am riding a horse, and you are taking the sedan. Don\u2019t you think this resembles a bridegroom on his way to fetch his bride? Why don\u2019t you just marry me?\u201d\u201cGet lost! You are so disgusting!\u201d Jun Mo Xie almost choked on his words and quickly closed the curtains as Tang Yuan laughed loudly outside the sedan.When Tang Yuan finally dismounted from his horse at the entrance of the Magnificent Jewel Hall, his horse was so exhausted that foam had appeared in its mouth. Tang Yuan\u2019s horse was undoubtedly a quality horse. However, Tang Yuan was simply a little too heavy for it.After sitting in the sedan for so long, Jun Mo Xie was feeling a little dizzy. He took a deep breath as he alighted from the sedan.\u201cIs this\u2026a little too big for the Magnificent Jewel Hall? So this is the \u201cauction house\u201d everyone is talking about?\u201d\u201cThis is just too ridiculous!\u201dAs long as it was within the capital, no countries would ever allow anyone to build a structure that would surpass the royal palace in size. This would be considered a sin, a sign of rebellion, and even a heinous crime!But the Magnificent Jewel Hall simply did!Based on Jun Mo Xie\u2019s impression, the Magnificent Jewel Hall standing before him was certainly larger, and more majestic than any royal palace he had seen in his life! But this did not seem to bother the royal family, but instead, it was something for them to be proud of! This fact alone was enough to let Jun Mo Xie\u2019s imaginations run wild. It seemed that the Tian Xiang Empire\u2019s royal family was probably aware of the Magnificent Jewel Hall\u2019s background.However, the Magnificent Jewel Hall still respects the royal family of Tian Xiang Empire. One of the largest box in the Magnificent Jewel Hall was specially reserved for the royal family alone. Regardless of whether they turned up, this box will always be kept empty for them. Several other countries also enjoyed the privilege of owning their own boxes but of course, theirs were relatively smaller.In Tian Xiang Empire, each of the upper class families had a box of their own but each of them had to pay a substantial amount of rental fees. However, none of these upper class families had pulled out because of this particular rule. Conversely, although there were limited boxes around the auction house, most of the seats had already been fixed. Because many of these seats are located in the Grand Hall, it would be highly embarrassing if the representatives of these upper class families were not seated in the Grand Hall itself!Therefore, the boxes in Magnificent Jewel Hall had long become a unique status symbol!Hardly anyone were added to this exclusive guest list.From the outside, the Magnificent Jewel Hall seemed to be interested only in money-making, and disinterested in political affairs. However, if any criminals were to escape to the Magnificent Jewel Hall hoping to receive protection, they would have been delusional! The Magnificent Jewel Hall would just have them tied up and arrested immediately, saving the officials\u2019 time and effort in tracking down the criminal. Regardless of whether one was right or wrong, as long as one tried to barge into the Magnificent Jewel Hall, one would be considered stirring trouble and that would be a serious offence!Jun Mo Xie looked intently at the large wide gates leading to the Magnificent Jewel Hall. Although Jun Mo Xie had never set foot in there, he knew very well that auctions were held almost every day at the Magnificent Jewel Hall. But the truly valuable items were only auction there once a month.And it happened to be that very special day today!The Magnificent Jewel Hall would always be extremely lively during this period.The most unusual characteristic about the Magnificent Jewel Hall was the items that it auctioned. Almost nobody knew the origin of these items and nobody had ever seen the Magnificent Jewel Hall perform any form of trade or acquisition of these items. It had never ran any pawn businesses either. All the items there seemed as though they were produced by the Magnificent Jewel Hall itself! This was certainly a puzzling question which no one had been able to answer yet.Fatty Tang seemed to be familiar with the place as he received greetings from several people at the Magnificent Jewel Hall. Jun Mo Xie appointed one of his guards to stay at the entrance to retrieve the additional money from the guard he had sent home earlier, and turned to follow Tang Yuan closely.As Jun Mo Xie proceeded on, he suddenly frowned.\u201cThis Magnificent Jewel Hall was truly extraordinary!\u201dFrom the moment he stepped into the hall, he had felt spiritual awareness sweeping through him at least five or six times, inspecting his whole body and searching every part of it! Jun Mo Xie\u2019s heart started racing! According to his speculations, the cultivation of all those experts were surely nothing less than the Jade Xuan Qi level!And this was only a preliminary inspection within the Magnificent Jewel Hall!Suddenly, two groups of people appeared behind Jun Mo Xie. All of them emitting a similar dark murderous aura which Jun Mo Xie himself could not have mistaken! In addition, a strong tension existed between these two groups of people, as though they were confronting each other on the battlefield! Jun Mo Xie gathered that these two groups of people were definitely not allies.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe shared the similar profession as them, or rather, he used to be.Jun Mo Xie continued walking on. Tang\u2019s family box was just a flight of stairs above. Just as he was walking up the steps, Jun Mo Xie suddenly seem to lose balance and staggered along the steps. He took this opportunity to throw a quick glance at the two groups of people behind him. He saw them walking in a different direction, splitting into two groups of three. One group entered a box covered by a curtain embroidered in a golden tulip flower, while the other group went towards a different box, and disappeared quickly behind a black curtain embroidered with a white snow lotus.At this point in time, the hall was already extremely packed, but everyone was seated comfortably and the atmosphere was harmonious and peaceful. A waiter walked around with a tray, serving the guests. Despite the huge crowd, the hall was extremely quiet. Everyone was well aware of the situation and knew they should stay far from causing any havoc inside the Magnificent Jewel Hall.Inside the Tang\u2019s family box, Jun Mo Xie looked across at his own Jun\u2019s family box. It had a white curtain with a blood-red blooming orchid flower embroidered on it. He could not help but smile. Ever since the Jun family had bought this box, the Jun family had entered it only two or three times. He wondered what Grandfather was thinking. He had always submitted the fees on time and kept the box till now. It seemed he really held the Magnificent Jewel Hall in high regard.\u201cTo whom do those two boxes belong to?\u201d Jun Mo Xie asked Tang Yuan causally while pointing at the boxes which the two suspicious groups of people had disappeared into.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

All the three Royal Princes have their boxes placed together, side by side. How can you not know about this?\u201d\u201cThis is just my first visit here, what are you talking about?\u201d Jun Mo Xie rolled his eyes, clearly annoyed.Tang Yuan thought for a moment and grinned sheepishly. \u201cIndeed, I have never seen Jun Mo Xie at the Magnificent Jewel Hall in all my past visits, and considering that he did me some favors recently, I shouldn\u2019t have said those words to him.\u201d Tang Yuan gave his own plump cheek a quick slap and said, \u201cI\u2019m the muddle-headed one!\u201dJun Mo Xie stared at him. Knowing that Tang Yuan was just a bootlicker, Jun Mo Xie simply ignored him. He was contemplating what Tang Yuan just said. \u201cThose people who just went into the princes\u2019 boxes were certainly emitting strong killing intent! This\u2026this is really weird!\u201d\u201cCould these men be related to the assassination attempt a few days ago?\u201d\u201cIf it is really true, then I must settle this debt once and for all. After all, I suffered quite badly in the hands of those fiends and was not only stabbed and kicked mercilessly but was also left on the brink of death. I didn\u2019t even have the chance to take my revenge on them. As a man of dignity, I cannot afford such humiliation\u2026However, which is the prince who plotted the assassination attempt? It would not be ideal if I put the blame on the wrong person. But nevertheless, even if I were to accuse the wrong the person, it does not matter much as they are brothers anyway.\u201d\u201cMo Xie, Li Feng and Meng Hai Zhou have just entered the Meng Family\u2019s box beside ours.\u201d Tang Yuan whispered bitterly, \u201cScoundrels! I must teach them a lesson one day!\u201dEver since these unscrupulous men set up the plot that almost caused Tang Yuan to lose his fiance in a bet, he had developed a strong hatred against them. But since there were too many things going on in the Capital lately, Tang Yuan\u2019s grandfather had warned everyone not to provoke anyone unnecessarily, especially his precious grandson Tang Yuan, who was known to be a troublemaker.\u201cOh? In the adjacent box? That is pretty close to us\u2026\u201d Jun Mo Xie smiled, his eyes twinkling playfully. \u201cFatty Tang, if you can agree to a condition, I can help you take revenge on these scoundrels by teaching them a lesson! What do you think?\u201d\u201cWe are brothers. As long as you are willing to help me out, I will agree to any condition of yours!\u201d Tang Yuan replied eagerly.\u201cThere are a few items that I must certainly obtain at the auction today. But I do not want others to know that I am the one buying them.\u201d Jun Mo Xie said directly, \u201cI will provide the money, but I need you to outbid others and get the items. As long as everything goes smoothly, I\u2019ll make sure those scoundrels wish that they were dead instead!\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Tang Yuan snorted. \u201cWhatever you need, I\u2019ll buy for you. We two are brothers, aren\u2019t we? There no need for you to be so formal! This is an insult to our relationship!\u201d\u201cThis is different, even true brothers have to settle this clearly. I don\u2019t take advantage of others, but I also won\u2019t allow others to take advantage of me!\u201d Jun Mo Xie argued. And indeed, these words encompassed the very fundamental principles that he lived on in his past and current lives.\u201cOkay, okay, whatever suits you! As long as you teach these scoundrels a good lesson, I will follow whatever you say!\u201dJun Mo Xie smiled before closing his eyes to concentrate on releasing his spiritual awareness. His targets were obviously the guests in the adjacent box and the boxes belonging to the two princes. Using the Art of Unlocking Heaven\u2019s Fortune, his spiritual awareness could detect even the slightest anomalies in his surroundings. Although he was not using his eyes, he could sense and observe more effectively using his spiritual awareness as nothing could escape its range.All of a sudden, the originally quiet hall became even quieter. The curtains on the stage slowly drew open to reveal a brightly colored podium, on which sat a complete amethyst gemstone glowing brilliantly in the light. The gemstone was mosaicked with hundreds and thousands of gemstones, each glittering brightly under the light in the hall. At this moment, the guests all felt as though they had entered a magical dreamland, their world filled with countless radiant stars. The sheer beauty was beyond description.Standing behind the podium was a man dressed in purple. The auctioneer was flanked by two stunning women who each held a tray. Wearing silver colored fitting dresses, the two women looked so charming and gorgeous that any men present, regardless of how strong-willed they were, would have been mesmerized by them instantly. Under the bright lights of the stage and coupled with their magnificent innate beauty, the duo looked more like goddesses descended from the heavens to grace everyone at this grand event!After a simple welcome speech, the auctioneer went straight into the main focus of the event. Through his years of experience at the auction house, he knew that no one was interested in the welcome speech. Instead of beating around the bush, why not strike the hammer and promptly begin the auction which everyone was eagerly anticipating?\u201cThe first item on auction is\u2026.\u201dSix items had been auctioned out consecutively. Although all of them were considered rare and exotic, they were merely decorative items. Jun Mo Xie was obviously not interested in these items. The occupants In the adjacent boxes and those of the two princes also displayed an extreme lack of enthusiasm when these items were on display. Eventually, these items fell into the hands of some wealthy businessmen in the hall.Observing the rocketing prices, Jun Mo Xie felt increasingly uneasy. \u201cAlthough the Blazing Heart Meridian is rare, it is just an ordinary herb with good healing abilities and moderate efficiency. It is not a\u00a0remarkable life-saving herb and is far from being found in the list of top-ranking herbs. But at this rate, the starting price for the Blazing Heart Meridian would be astronomically high by the time it is put on auction!\u201dHow could this be? Could there be some hidden tricks of motives behind this?Grasping tightly to the few million taels of silver his guard brought to him, Jun Mo Xie started to frown.All of a sudden, Jun Mo Xie\u2019s spiritual awareness detected a change in atmosphere in the adjacent boxes and the princes\u2019 boxes. Jun Mo Xie opened his eyes and looked at Tang Yuan, \u201cIt\u2019s time for us to get into action. It seems like the next item is of notable interest to the crowd and is sought after by Meng Hai Zhou.\u201dJun Mo Xie was certain that the fluctuations he felt were due to the rising excitement and elation of the guests in the hall! It seemed that the next item was something that they had long been waiting for!\u201cThe next article of this auction is something very unique. I am sure each and every one of you here has heard of it. It is the Jade Sea Coral! I believe everyone has seen violet corals and corals of other colors. But, this is the first time the Jade Sea Coral has appeared in the Magnificent Jewel Hall! Across the whole continent, barely anyone has seen it personally before. At least up till today, I myself have never seen it!\u201d The auctioneer smiled as the silver-clad girls behind him walked forth, carrying an object covered in a red silk cloth. They laid it down gently on the podium while the crowd watched in silent anticipation.\u201cFatty Tang, this is the item they want! Once the starting price is out, just raise it up as high as you can! Don\u2019t give anyone a chance to bid at all!\u201d Jun Mo Xie grinned as he called out. Using his spiritual awareness, he could sense that the atmosphere in the adjacent box had clearly plummeted to a feverish excitement the moment the Jade Sea Coral appeared. He was very sure that obtaining this piece of Jade Sea Coral was a primary purpose of their visit today. \u201cWhat a perfect opportunity to mess things up for them?\u201d Jun Mo Xie thought.\u201cAre you sure? This is just a mere decoration!\u201d Tang Yuan asked doubtfully.\u201cI am sure!\u201d Jun Mo Xie nodded confidently, \u201cThere is nothing to worry about.\u201d\u201cUnderstood!\u201d Tang Yuan responded without hesitation. His trust in Jun Mo Xie was so strong that he chose to believe him without even pausing to consider his words at all!The red silk cloth was then removed, revealing the snow colored Jade Sea Coral. It emanated a strong crystalline brilliance and yet at the same time produced a soft and delicate sensation. The Coral was a foot wide, three feet long and four feet tall! Even if it was a common ordinary coral, one as large as this would have fetched an exorbitant price! Moreover, this was not any ordinary coral, but the Jade Sea Coral!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThe Jade Sea Coral, two feet and eight inches long, three feet and nine inches tall, and one foot wide! It embodies the natural energy. When placed at home, it would greatly assist one in Xuan Qi cultivation and also calm one\u2019s soul, protecting it from the temptation of darkness. The starting price of this would be a hundred and twenty thousand taels and each increase have to be ten thousand minimally!\u201dThe moment the auctioneer finished his words, a voice rang out and echoed throughout the hall, \u201cI bid one million!\u201d It was none other than Tang Yuan himself!The great hall turned completely silent in an instant. A hundred pairs of eyes turned towards Tang Yuan almost simultaneously as he tried to stand up straight, proudly watching the crowd.\u201cAre you kidding? The starting price was only one hundred and twenty thousand but you went all the way to a million in the first bid? Can\u2019t you give others a chance? Even if you are determined to win, you don\u2019t need to be so extravagant! If bids were called normally, the price would probably reach half a million at most. But this man just called a bid of a million on the first bid! Isn\u2019t that a little too much?\u201d\u201cThis man is mentally unsound!\u201d Everyone glared at Fatty Tang with contempt in their eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A million taels of silver was certainly not a small sum, but it was not too high either! Hence, it was something they could still afford!During the game at the Thousand Gold Hall a few weeks ago, Meng Hai Zhou and Li Zhen had indeed lost quite a fair share of their wealth! Hence, their pockets are rather tight at the moment. However, this Jade Sea Coral was something that they must obtain at all costs!Three days before each auction, the Magnificent Jewel Hall would routinely send every major family in the Tian Xiang Empire a list of all the items which would be auctioned on that particular day. When Li Youran saw Jade Sea Coral on the list of items, he immediately sent out an order, \u201cThe Li Family must obtain the Jade Sea Coral at all costs!\u201dIn fact, these auction listings were regularly sent to the Jun Family too. However, the Jun Family never seemed to be interested in auctions. As time passed by, the Magnificent Jewel Hall stopped issuing the list to the Jun\u2019s Residence. Moreover, Jun Mo Xie\u2019s intention to gather herbs for his uncle\u2019s treatment was meant to be kept secret. In fact, only three people in the Jun\u2019s Residence knew about the situation. If Jun Mo Xie had not run into Tang Yuan today, he would most likely have missed the Burning Heart Meridian\u2026Although the Jade Sea Coral was valuable, its purpose was only in facilitating cultivation! However, for Grand Preceptor Li who had a broken Dan Tian and could no longer use Xuan Qi, this was certainly a valuable treasure that could bring him longevity! There was also a chance that he could even achieve re-cultivation! Li Youran had heard from a reliable source that if the natural energy in the Jade Sea Coral was harvested appropriately, it was possible to restore a broken Dan Tian and start cultivating Xuan Qi again!Only a handful of people in the entire Tian Xiang Empire knew about this hidden property. Li Youran had been searching the Jade Sea Coral for ages but it had always eluded him!If Grand Preceptor Li could prolong his life by a few more years, it would be an immense benefit for the Li family! This piece of Jade Sea Coral might just be an expensive piece of decoration for many but for the Li Family, it had a strong impact on their future!The appearance of the Jade Sea Coral at the auction was a great opportunity for the Li Family! Determined to acquire the Jade Sea Coral,\u00a0Li Youran had ordered Li Zhen and Meng Hai Zhou to obtain the treasure at all costs during the auction!\u00a0Had Li Youran knew that his long-awaited plan would be disrupted today, he would definitely have gone down to the auction house to bid for it personally!The Meng and Li Families had teamed up earlier on and intended to rely on their combined prestige to make a high starting bid, hoping to discourage other buyers from outbidding them. They believed this would be a foolproof plan to obtaining the Jade Sea Coral with great ease. Little did they expect to encounter their old rival, Fatty Tang, today!In addition, Jun Mo Xie had already realized their intentions completely using his spiritual awareness. However, the Meng and Li Families were completely oblivious about this!Despite being an experienced auctioneer, the old auctioneer was still immensely shocked and surprised by Tang Yuan\u2019s initial bid!For a long moment, the hall was completely silent. All of a sudden, someone shouted, \u201cI bid 1.2 million!\u201dLi Zhen had to bite the bullet in calling this bid. Although the amount was well within their budget, this additional 2 hundred thousand taels was simply meant to intimidate Fatty Tang!Without hesitation, Tang Yuan roared at the top of his lungs, \u201cAre you trying to scare me with this pitiful amount? I bid 2 million!\u201dFatty was relishing in the moment! Nothing felt better than watching his rivals\u2019 frenzied reaction towards his ridiculous bidding without him having to pay a single cent!In the adjacent box, Li Zhen and Meng Hai Zhou almost fainted as their faces turned as white as sheet!During this visit, Li Youran had handed them about 2 million taels of silver. They predicted that the highest price this piece of jade would go would be 4 to 5 hundred thousand, regardless of how rare and precious it was. Two million was certainly beyond their expectations! Li Zhen and Meng Hai Zhou initially thought they could pocket the remaining of the budget as compensation for their heavy losses at the Thousand Gold Hall recently. But at this point in time, they realized it had become an elusive dream. Thanks to Fatty Tang, they would have to start using their own pocket money if the bidding continues.They did not even dare to approach Li Youran for additional reimbursement for the cost of the Jade Sea Coral!\u201c2.4 million!\u201d Li Zhen announced. His face had already turned purple in anger and rising frustration, \u201cTang Yuan! Do you really want this Jade Sea Coral so badly? It is absolutely useless to you! Just give it up!\u201d\u201cNonsense! How do you know this is useless to me! If it is truly useless to me, then why should I even bother arguing with you? Do you think you are very handsome?\u201d Tang Yuan retorted and stamped his foot down, causing the whole box to shake. He then shouted, \u201c3 million!\u201dAlthough the walls of these boxes were soundproofed, everyone could hear the commotion taking place between these two boxes.Meng Hai Zhou responded furiously, \u201c3.5 million!\u201dAfter calling out, he jumped out of his box and came to the Tang Family\u2019s box, yelling, \u201cFatty Tang, you have already extorted\u00a02 million taels of silver from us at the Thousand Gold Hall back then, and that was more than sufficient to compensate your losses! What else do you want? You are just too unreasonable!\u201d\u201cHuh? Both of you are really strange! Tang Yuan was the first to bid 1 million on this piece of jade. Nobody was interested in bidding further and the jade was clearly his. However, you intervened and deliberately bid for higher prices, forcing him to go even higher. You are the one trying to sabotage others. I am sure everyone here can testify for this. How can you accuse my good friend here of malicious intents?\u201d Jun Mo Xie spoke up before Tang Yuan could respond. He continued, \u201cAre the Li and Meng Families always so unreasonable?\u201dAs Jun Mo Xie was speaking, a girl\u2019s voice sounded from one of the boxes of the Tian Xiang Royal family, \u201cIt\u2019s Jun Mo Xie.\u201d This voice was filled with respect, admiration, and relief.\u201cJun Mo Xie! This is none of your business. There is no need for you to interfere with our affairs!\u201d Meng Hai Zhou snapped furiously, his voice boiling with anger. Meng Hai Zhou\u2019s plans were also spoilt by Jun Mo Xie the previous time and it caused him to be caned severely by the elders in his family. That was not the end. Shortly after, Tang Yuan had also blackmailed him for an additional 2 million taels of silver! He had barely recovered from his losses yet! And here he was, standing before this terrible duo again. What a thorn in his flesh!\u201cMy affair is his affair! Now, cut the crap. If you truly want the item, show us you have the money to afford it! If you have no money, then jolly well get out!\u201d Tang Yuan challenged angrily as his fat belly stuck out awkwardly. \u201cI bid 4 million! Can you challenge me? Let me tell you this. I have nothing but money! Precisely because I\u2019ve so much money, I can afford to burn it fast! What can you do about it?\u201dEveryone in the hall was staring in astonishment. On one side, it was the Li and Meng Families, while on the other, it was the Tang and Jun Families! This had clearly become a feud between the young masters of four major families. Everyone remained silent and continued to watch the comical scene unfold.Grandfather Jun had only stained his hands with blood recently and the blood on the streets had yet to dry up. Who would have the courage to cause such trouble again?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euCursing bitterly, Meng Hai Zhou stood outside the Tang Family\u2019s box, shaking in anger. He really wanted to walk out of this mess but he was too afraid to go against Li Youran. As such, he could only bite his teeth and endure the pain. With frustration, Meng Hai Zhou shouted, \u201cI bid 5 million! 5 million taels of silver! Tang Yuan, do you have the guts the compete against me?\u201dJun Mo Xie narrowed his eyes. His spiritual awareness could easily sense every disturbance or change in emotions of the people surrounded by his power. He could feel that Meng Hai Zhou was extremely close to the point of insanity. He also knew that this was probably the highest price that Meng Hai Zhou and Li Zhen would be able to afford! If Tang Yuan bid any further, it would simply drill a large hole through his pockets and force them to take home a mere piece of decorative jade. Jun Mo Xie quickly gave Tang Yuan a wink.Taking the cue, Tang Yuan laughed and responded, \u201cYoung Master Meng, you really have a deep pocket, don\u2019t you? 5 million taels of silver! You are essentially paying 10 times more than the amount this piece of Jade is worth. I truly admire you. I admire you from the bottom of my heart! I do not have enough money this time, so I shall give it to you.\u201d He then leaned over and whispered into Meng Hai Zhou\u2019s ear mysteriously, \u201cYoung Master Meng, to be honest, I did not bring any money at all today. I was just bidding for fun!\u201dMeng Hai Zhou\u2019s eyes suddenly turned round and wide.\u00a0He stared at Tang Yuan, pointing a pale trembling finger at him and stood there for a few seconds before coughing up blood and collapsing to the ground!\u201cI can\u2019t believe he is so weak. It\u2019s just a casual remark. How could we not bring any money today?\u201d Jun Mo Xie shook his head as he watched Meng Hai Zhou falling heavily to the ground. He continued, \u201cYou can\u2019t even stand a simple joke? Such an embarrassment!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In fact, I truly brought money with me. If I did not have sufficient money, how would I dare to bid such a high price? This is not an ordinary auction but the Magnificent Jewel Hall itself! It is embarrassing that you can\u2019t even distinguish such simple truth. If I were you I would have hanged myself. It is really disdainful knowing that your family actually entrusted you with so much money.\u201dAs the whole farce played out, it seemed Meng Hai Zhou had won the bid by paying ten times the original amount to obtain the Jade Sea Coral. However, in the eyes of all those present, there was nothing but contempt for Meng Hai Zhou.Buying an item worth 5 hundred thousand at a price of 5 million was simply too insane! Some even considered it fundamentally unethical.Meng Hai Zhou did not receive the faintest sense of sympathy from the crowd. In the eyes of the third parties, the Jade Sea Coral was something that Tang Yuan was determined to acquire, therefore leading to the high starting bid of 1 million. This price far exceeded the value of the Jade Sea Coral and already hinted Tang Yuan\u2019s strong desire for the ornament. However, the Li and Meng duo were obviously trying to make things difficult for the Tang Family by raising the price unnecessarily.Unfortunately, Li Zhen and Meng Hai Zhou did not expect the other party to give in so easily. In the end, they bidded too aggressively, forcing Tang Yuan to withdraw from the bidding war and causing them to pay a hefty price for a mere decorative item. Meng Hai Zhou was simply shooting himself in his the leg! At least this was what the truth appeared to be in the eyes of the observers.These malicious people deserve to get their retribution!The crowd was instead sympathizing with Tang Yuan, \u201cPoor kid, you are too young and naive. If you had bid on this item slowly and carefully, you might just be able to obtain it! There is no rush in bidding so aggressively and revealing your intentions so early.\u201dThe expressions on Li Zhen and Meng Hai Zhou were unexpectedly similar to Tang Yuan\u2019s, one which relished in others\u2019 predicament! \u201cDon\u2019t ever try your dirty tricks again! How does it feel to slap yourself in the face? Serve you right!\u201dTang Yuan seemed to portray a victimised look on the exterior but internally, he was extremely delighted. Seeing the look of defeat and despair on Li Zhen and Meng Hai Zhou, Tang Yuan felt extremely relieved! Not only did he vent his frustration, he also managed to deliver an all-out revenge on his rivals! Nothing felt better, more exciting, and more fulfilling than this!At this point in time, a servant of the Magnificent Jewel Hall walked over to the Meng Family\u2019s box, carrying the Jade Sea Coral in a tray. The red silk cloth was cupped delicately over it. Li Zhen and Meng Hai Zhou bit their lips. Their hearts were so hurt that they seemed to be bleeding. Nevertheless, they forced a smile to conceal their emotions.It would have been normal if these two had remained dejected. What caught Jun Mo Xie\u2019s attention was the fact that Li Zhen and Meng Hai Zhou appeared relieved despite the terrible loss they suffered. Jun Mo Xie, who originally had no knowledge of the origins and mysteries behind the Jade Sea Coral, suddenly grew curious and suspicious towards it.\u201cThis item seems to be exceptionally useful to them and it appears that they wanted it all costs. Hmmm\u2026Whatever benefits the enemy must certainly be disadvantageous to us! This is bad, I must destroy this piece of jade!\u201d No matter what its uses were, Jun Mo Xie would only feel at ease only if the Jade Sea Coral was rendered useless.\u201cWow! So this is the Jade Sea Coral that is worthed 5 million? True enough, it is as rare as an immortal\u2019s fart!\u201d Jun Mo Xie mocked as he watched Li Zhen carefully receiving the Jade Sea Coral. At the same time, Jun Mo Xie whistled softly and nudged Tang Yuan gently.Tang Yuan took the cue and instantly put on a pitiful look. Looking at the Jade Sea Coral, he whimpered sadly, \u201cJun Mo Xie, what now? Grandfather had ordered me to bring back the Jade Sea Coral at all costs. But now\u2026Oh, brother, I am doomed!\u201dThese words were deliberately meant for Li Zhen and Meng Hai Zhou. Upon hearing this, their spirits lifted slightly. \u201cSo this was indeed something Grandfather Tang needed. No wonder Tang Yuan was bidding so desperately for it!\u201d With this in mind, both felt somewhat pleased with themselves.They did not expect their bidding to bring such great repercussions to Grandfather Tang! They felt really good!Jun Mo Xie curled his lips and asked arrogantly, \u201cIsn\u2019t that just a piece of Jade Sea Coral? Why do you all have to get so flustered over it? I have a couple of such jade ornaments at home myself, it is nothing rare to me!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Li Zhen\u2019s face instantly reddened as he rebutted, \u201cJun Mo Xie, you little scoundrel! The Jun Family is so poor that it is almost on the verge of collapsing and yet you dare claim you possess such a rare item? Or even a couple of it? Are you not afraid of suffering retribution for uttering such ridiculous lies?\u201dJun Mo Xie jumped up suddenly and rebuked angrily, \u201cLi Zhen, what do you mean? His Majesty had bestowed several of such Jade Sea Corals to my grandfather, and they were all much larger than the one you are holding! I\u2019m really surprised by your stupidity and ignorance!\u201dLi Zhen laughed and replied, \u201cThis is truly ludicrous, Jun Mo Xie! What does a potato like you know about this item? This is the Jade Sea Coral! The Jade Sea Coral, do you understand? I really cannot be bothered to talk to you!\u201d\u201cMy family also has a Jade Sea Coral like this. And it is so\u2026so big!\u201d Jun Mo Xie gestured wildly with his hands to outline the shape of a large jade ornament. \u201cFatty Tang has seen it. I am not lying!\u201d Seeing Li Zhen\u2019s lack of response towards his random gestures, Jun Mo Xie went towards Li Zhen and gestured directly on his Jade Sea Coral to illustrate the stark contrast in size.Jun Mo Xie\u2019s gestures seemed to outline a size which was more than double that of the Jade Sea Coral Li Zhen was holding. He then snorted and continued disdainfully, \u201cThe one in my home is crimson red! It is definitely much better than the one you are holding right now!\u201d However, as Jun Mo Xie was gesturing, he secretly executed the Art of Unlocking Heaven\u2019s Fortune, directing it towards the Jade Sea Coral. All of a sudden, he felt a\u00a0trace of Qi flowing within the Jade Sea Coral. At the same time, he found his own Xuan Qi becoming much denser and significantly more active!\u201cSo the Jade Sea Coral is actually useful in Xuan Qi cultivation?\u201d Jun Mo Xie snorted in his heart. \u201cHowever, why is this aura so similar to the Qi in my Exquisite Hongjun Pagoda?\u201d With this thought in mind, Jun Mo Xie deliberately allowed streams of Qi from the Jade Sea Coral to enter his own meridians and assimilate with his own Qi. But in doing so, he suddenly felt extreme discomfort. His Exquisite Hongjun Pagoda started spinning uncontrollably, swiftly emitting his own Qi, which in turn forced the foreign energy out of his meridians!\u201cThey repel each other?\u201d Jun Mo Xie\u2019s eyes widened.At this point in time, Li Zhen was seething with anger as he watched Jun Mo Xie perform his antics. He quickly removed the red silk cloth that was covering the ornament and roared, \u201cThis is the Jade Sea Coral! Jade Sea Coral! The one you have is the ordinary Ruby Sea Coral! Oh my goodness! You know absolutely nothing about this!\u201dJun Mo Xie laughed and said, \u201cWhatever! Regardless of what type of sea coral it is, their textures and qualities are all the same! Li Zhen, you are unbelievably stupid! You just spent 5 million taels of silver on a piece of trash!\u201dHe then placed his hand casually on the Jade Sea Coral to rub it. He frowned and said, \u201cIt seems a little different.\u201d While speaking, Jun Mo Xie quickly channelled the Art of Unlocking Heaven\u2019s Fortune at full power, releasing a pure fragment of his own Qi into the Jade Sea Coral to occupy a particular spot in it!As the two opposing Qi collided against each other in the small space, the original Qi in the Jade Sea Coral was forced into a corner. The moment Jun Mo Xie withdrew his hand, the original Qi reflected violently, surrounding and overwhelming the Jun Mo Xie\u2019s Qi with layers of its own.Jun Mo Xie secretly tested the Jade Sea Coral with his spiritual awareness. Under the violent reaction of the two opposing Qi energies, the Jade Sea Coral was nothing but a huge mass of unstable and uncontrollable energy. Jun Mo Xie could not help but laugh silently. \u201cSeems like\u2026The Jade Sea Coral is useless now! Haha!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHow is it? It is different from the one you have at home, isn\u2019t it? Hahaha\u2026\u201d Li Zhen laughed, thinking that he had finally gained the upper hand. As he saw the apparent disappointment on Jun Mo Xie, a wave of ecstasy overwhelmed him.\u201cIt is different indeed.\u201d Jun Mo Xie\u2019s face turned white slightly. Pulling back his hand, he rubbed his nose and asked innocently, \u201cThey are all sea corals. What makes them so different?\u201dTang Yuan touched it gently and was also seemingly amazed. Li Zhen and Meng Hai Zhou gained a huge ego boost upon seeing their reactions. Their heart swelled with pride as they laughed uncontrollably. After a long moment, they looked at Jun Mo Xie and Tang Yuan with proud satisfaction and said fiercely, \u201cEnough of staring at this treasure. You don\u2019t have this, do you? Aren\u2019t you envious? Oh, Fatty\u2026.Hahaha!\u201d They continued to mock Tang Yuan gloatingly.\u201cHaha\u2026since you failed to obtain the Jade Sea Coral, I wonder how your grandfather would punish you? To have Grandfather Tang personally teaching you a lesson, perhaps, it is not too bad of a compensation for the losses we made today\u2026\u201dJun Mo Xie looked embarrassed, but in his heart, he thought, \u201cBoth of you would be dead, not us!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Finally, it was the item Jun Mo Xie had been anticipating, the Blazing Heart Meridian!\u201cThe Blazing Heart Meridian is an extremely poisonous herb. Also known as the Bone Mist, it\u2019s poison was so overpowering that it could cause one\u2019s soul to be ripped apart and scattered in the wind! However, this herb also had extraordinary healing abilities for a particular group of people, especially for people who are infected with strong poison. A small dose of this herb would instantly nullify the poison and cure the user. If an advanced Xuan Qi cultivator could assimilate this poisonous herb into his bones and flesh, he could even render his body immune to all sorts of poison! The starting price for this item is 200,000 taels of silver and each additional bid has to be a minimum of 10,000 taels of silver.\u201dThe auctioneer held a white jade box in his hand and slowly opened the lid. In it lay a single stalk of black lotus. It emanated a demonic and dangerous glow.\u201cThe Blazing Heart Meridian have completely turned black! No wonder this item is auctioned only at the end. Based on the colour alone, this lotus is at least 500 years\u2019 old! Its effects are a lot stronger than the ordinary items and it is undoubtedly a rare treasure!\u201d Jun Mo Xie sighed and said softly, \u201cFatty Tang, this is what I came for!\u201d He then held up three fingers.Jun Mo Xie thought silently, \u201cWhile the introduction on the uses of the Blazing Heart Meridian was already very detailed, it still missed an important fact. Had anyone known about this secret, they would probably not auction it off!\u201dThe \u2018Blazing Heart Meridian\u2019 was just an epithet used in the Xuan Xuan continent. On Earth where it originated from, as long as it was over 200 years\u2019 old, it would be called something else \u2013 Heaven and Earth Bridge! This herb was a treasure coveted by all warriors alike. If one could consume this herb after removing the toxic from it, it would instantly revitalize one\u2019s Meridians, allowing one to traverse the bridge between Heaven and Earth! It could easily boost one\u2019s power by margins tantamount to 20 years of cultivation!A Blazing Heart Meridian aged over 500 years was said to be the best among the best. By using it, the probability of restoring Jun Wu Yi\u2019s health would be close to ninety percent! And this was merely a conservative estimate by Jun Mo Xie!As Jun Mo Xie\u2019s thoughts and the auctioneer\u2019s words ended, Fatty Tang\u2019s voice immediately rang out, \u201cI bid 300,000!\u201dJust as this sound rang out, in the hall, everyone\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cThis extravagant bidder is back again! Although he only raised his bid by 100,000, it is still 10 times of the minimum incremental amount of 10,000! It is best not to compete with him. What if the price went beyond limits and this person just withdraw again just like the previous time? Wouldn\u2019t it be shooting yourself in your own foot? Who hadn\u2019t seen the Meng Family\u2019s Young Master spitting blood just now?\u201dAs a result, the audience went completely silent after Fatty Tang\u2019s bid! No one spoke for a long time.To be honest, the old, purple robed auctioneer was somewhat dumbfounded at the moment. This Blazing Heart Meridian could surely sell for over 800,000 but did he really have to auction it off at a mere 300,000 taels of silver? However, the Magnificent Jewel Hall had stringent rules and nothing could be done. The auctioneer paused for a moment before raising his hammer and saying, \u201cYoung Master Tang has bid 300,000, are there any higher bids?\u201d He paused a little longer before continuing, \u201c300,000 going once\u2026\u201d\u201c300,000 going twice\u2026\u201dSuddenly a hoarse voice called out vehemently, \u201cI bid 3,000,000!\u201dThis voice was none other than Li Zhen!Just as everything was going smoothly for Tang Yuan, Li Zhen suddenly interrupted his plans. Tang Yuan exploded in anger and jumped into the doorway of Meng\u2019s Family box, yelling, \u201cYou immoral scoundrel! How dare you compete with me? I bid 500\u2026\u201d A hand cupped over Fatty Tang\u2019s mouth suddenly. It was Jun Mo Xie! Although he did not finish his words, everyone in the hall still broke into cold sweat. Everyone could guess that Fatty Tang actually intended to call 5,000,000!Crazy! Fatty Tang must have been out of his mind!Jun Mo Xie twisted his neck and walked out. Though he still appeared sickly, he seemed extremely domineering. Opening the curtain, his foot landed outside with a loud slam! With a swift motion, he took off his hat and unbuttoned his long flowing robes. Glaring at Li Zhen with vicious narrow eyes, he thundered, \u201cLi Zhen, you imbecile rascal! Are you seeking death?\u201d\u201cWho are you to say this? This is an auction house! If you can bid a price, why can\u2019t I? Come bite me if you dare!\u201d Li Zhen retorted angrily before jumping out of his box with a sinister look on his face.\u201cWho am I? Bah!\u201d Jun Mo Xie glared at him as if spotting a black sheep among the herd. With twisted eyes and lips, he continued, \u201cAs if you can churn up an additional 3,000,000 taels of silver with the pocket you just emptied during your previous bid! Li Zhen, I am not trying to belittle you, but can you please show us your 3,000,000 right now? As long as you can prove that you have this amount of money, this strand of grass will be yours! If you cannot bring out that amount, then I\u2019d like to ask, what is it that you two have against Fatty Tang that you have to consistently make things difficult for him? Do Tang Yuan and you have any grudges? Or do you have something against Grandfather Tang?\u201dOpposite, Dugu Xiaoyi let out a faint chuckle before saying, \u201cThis rascal is really annoying! How could he call this precious Blazing Heart Meridian a strand of grass? Such an ignorant man\u2026\u201dBeside her, Princess Ling Meng gave Dugu Xiaoyi a surprised look and felt her forehead, \u201cIs sister having a fever? A moment ago she had a look of worry. Why did her attitude change suddenly?\u201dRecently, the Dugu Family had been facing troubles because of Dugu Xiaoyi. This young lady had changed drastically all of a sudden. She used to have an extremely cheerful and lively demeanor but her positivity inexplicably disappeared. She would break into tears for no apparent reason and sit in a daze for hours. She skipped meals frequently as well. This made General Dugu Wudi extremely heartbroken. He and his wives had tried asking her about her problems but to no avail. He could only watch his precious and beloved daughter grow thinner with each passing day. General Dugu could not do anything to help her. Whenever he was exasperated, he would vent his frustration by hitting his sons and nephews!Fortunately, her condition improved slightly after Lady Dugu requested Princess Ling Meng to accompany Dugu Xiaoyi. Recently, Lady Dugu received the newsletter from the Magnificent Jewel Hall about the auction and immediately urged these two to attend the event and catch some fresh air. However, Dugu Xiaoyi was extremely reluctant. But who would have known her sickly appearance had instantly vanished after going to the Magnificent Jewel Hall? This was absolutely bewildering! Could there be some kind of divine healing medicine within the Magnificent Jewel Hall itself?Li Zhen and his company looked at one another. The few of them combined could hardly produce 100,000 taels of silver, not to mention 3,000,000. His face turned sour as the harsh reality struck him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cA bunch of penniless souls! I really cannot be bothered with you!\u201d Jun Mo Xie snorted in disdain before patting his backside and mocked, \u201cEven my fart is worthed more than the words you said. What tricks can you play with no money in your pockets?\u201dIn an extremely arrogant manner, Jun Mo Xie turned towards the crowd with an ignorant look and asked, \u201cWho else wants this herb? You are all welcome to bid, come on!\u201d Then with a snap of his fingers, he added, \u201cIt will only cost several million taels of silver.\u201dThe people in the hall all turned away and pretended that they heard nothing. \u201cSpending millions to buy a herb? No way! It\u2019s not as though this herb can revive the dead! Who in the right mind would do such a stupid thing?\u201dAll of a sudden, two huge clouds of spiritual pressure descended upon Jun Mo Xie from an unknown location. Jun Mo Xie\u2019s face turned white and he quickly reacted to the situation. He started to shiver a little before shouting in his mind, \u201cWhat a terrible weather today, why is it so cold?\u201d The spiritual pressure scanned him thoroughly once more and without finding anything amiss, they disappeared as quickly as they appeared.Jun Mo Xie chuckled silently, \u201cIf you managed to dig out anything from me so easily with that poor trick, then I won\u2019t be here today.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It seemed that he had been listening to murmurings of the people in the hall. A trace of pained expression appeared momentarily on his face as he exclaimed, \u201cThe Blazing Heart Meridian. Tang Yuan has already bid 5,000,000, is there anyone who is willing to bid a higher price?\u201dJun Mo Xie reeled in shock and looked at the auctioneer as he said, \u201cSenior, aren\u2019t you making this a little too difficult for us? It was clearly Li Zhen who was maliciously trying to raise the price. This has nothing to do with my friend over here, why must you insist on raising the price to 5,000,000?\u201d\u201cThose not participating in the bidding process are forbidden from speaking and disrupting the bidding process!\u201d Jun Mo Xie was completely ignored by the auctioneer, who simply turned to Tang Yuan and asked, \u201cMr. Tang, do you have any objections?\u201dTang Yuan who was usually filled with arrogance, suddenly turned completely submissive. He replied softly, \u201cI did not state how much I wanted to bid just now, didn\u2019t I\u2026\u201dJun Mo Xie realized that Tang Yuan, who was usually bursting with arrogance, had suddenly turned meek and afraid! It was totally unlike his usual self! It was strange that he was giving in so easily to the request of paying a whopping 5,000,000 taels for the Blazing Heart Meridian! This was something negotiable!Moreover, it seemed like the Magnificent Jewel Hall was deliberately making things difficult for them. Jun Mo Xie was after all the \u2018Evil Monarch\u2019. Pride was something that was deeply ingrained in his bones. How could he allow others to take advantage of him so easily? He said with a sneer, \u201cIs the Magnificent Jewel Hall actually forcing a hard sell? If I remembered correctly, Tang Yuan only called out \u2018500\u2019 and nothing more. When did he say \u20185,000,000\u2019? If the Magnificent Jewel Hall feels that it is appropriate, let\u2019s close the deal at 500 taels!\u201dIndeed, Tang Yuan had only called out \u201c5 hundred\u201d. Jun Mo Xie had already covered his mouth before he could shout out the remaining \u201cthousand\u201d.Both sides froze for a long moment. Li Zhen and his company were actually getting excited about seeing Jun Mo Xie challenging the Magnificent Jewel Hall! The crowd was completely silent. On one side, it was the Magnificent Jewel Hall and on the other, the powerful Jun Family! Both factions were powers to be reckoned with and few dared to offend them! Suddenly, a voice from an unknown source broke the silence. \u201cThe rules of the Magnificent Jewel Hall cannot be broken. Since a bid was made and a price was spoken, that is it!\u201d The voice seemed surreal and omnipresent, soft but sharp. It rang out distinctly in the ears of all those present.The complexion of the auctioneer suddenly changed. He said, \u201cThe Magnificent Jewel Hall will never buy or sell anything by force. Regardless of whether the Jun and Tang Family\u2019s Young Masters will visit again, it is inconsequential. Today, the deal has been established. Tang Yuan will pay 5,000,000 for the Blazing Heart Meridian!\u201d The auctioneer seemingly turned bold again after the mysterious voice had spoken.Despite being a deadly killer with a calm composure, Jun Mo Xie\u2019s face still showed a slight change in expression. 5,000,000 was definitely a lot of money but it was not something that was significant enough to shake him. He was not suspicious about the auctioneer\u2019s sudden change in attitude, but the origin of the surreal and nebulous voice that rang in the hall. The voice projection clearly showed that the power of this person was comparable to the expert whom he encountered recently, Ye Guhan, who was in the initial stages of Sky Xuan cultivation!\u201cBut\u2026but why would such an expert want to make things difficult for Fatty Tang? Or, is he or she trying to make things difficult for me?\u201dAlthough Jun Mo Xie was highly capable, he was equally arrogant. He would not allow himself to suffer such humiliation in silence! This was a whopping 5,000,000 taels of silver!True enough, the healing effects of the Blazing Heart Meridian was indeed immense and it was indispensable for Jun Wu Yi\u2019s treatment. Even if Jun Mo Xie had to pay twice the amount, he would do it all costs. However, winning a bidding war and being taken advantage of were two different things altogether! If he were to succumb to the pressure of paying 5,000,000 at that point in time, regardless of whether the deal was worthwhile, the humiliation alone would have suffocated him!Moreover, it had become clear that the Magnificent Jewel Hall was simply trying to twist words to force logic! What Jun Mo Xie hated most was seeing people oppress others with their power! And, there was no exception to this situation.\u201cWhat rules of the Magnificent Jewel Hall have I broken? Hahaha\u2026\u201d If Jun Mo Xie had been acting previously, then at this moment he was indeed getting a little angry. Jun Mo Xie continued with a sneer, \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then I would sit here every single day to raise prices and let the Magnificent Jewel Hall fill its pockets!\u201d\u201cYoung Master Jun, what do you mean by this? Am I right to say that the reputed Jun Family of the Tian Xiang Empire wishes to go against the Magnificent Jewel Hall?\u201d The voice remained surreal and nebulous, echoing in the air above the hall. However, the sheer pressure it asserted seemed suffocating and overbearing.All watched intently as the situation developed. Many looked at Jun Mo Xie with pity in their eyes, thinking, \u201cIf this imbecile man uttered another word, he will probably bring great disaster to Tian Xiang Empire. Jun Mo Xie is far too reckless! How dare he provoke the Magnificent Jewel Hall?\u201dLi Zhen and Meng Hai Zhou were totally elated! Although they had spent an exorbitant amount of money today, it would be totally worth it if their actions caused the Magnificent Jewel Hall and the Jun Family to sow the seed of discord!In the box opposite them, Dugu Xiaoyi stamped her feet down anxiously and said, \u201cWhat a fool! How dare he openly defy the Magnificent Jewel Hall? How can this be of any good?\u201d Filled with anxiety, she held Princess Ling Ming\u2019s hand as she continued to observe the events unfold.Jun Mo Xie grew extremely alert as he heard the words spoken by the expert. \u201cThis person is deliberately creating a rift between the Jun Family and the Magnificent Jewel Hall, could there be any past feuds between the Jun Family and the Magnificent Jewel Hall?\u201d After considerable thought, Jun Mo Xie decided to cut to the chase.\u201cSuch empty and baseless claims. You said that Tang Yuan bid an amount of 5,000,000, but who here can testify that they heard this? All I heard was a mere \u2018500\u2019. Isn\u2019t that what it should be then? In addition, Li Zhen bid 3,000,000 taels of silver. However, has the Magnificent Jewel Hall even verified if he had such a large sum of money with him? If he can\u2019t prove it, is it even justifiable to raise prices with no capital? You questioned if the Jun Family is going against the interest of the Magnificent Jewel Hall? Then I have to ask, is this the Magnificent Jewel Hall\u2019s deliberate plot to accumulate wealth by exploiting on others?\u201dEveryone was utterly shocked by Jun Mo Xie\u2019s words! This sentence was tantamount to accusing the Magnificent Jewel Hall of collaborating with the Li Family to drain Tang Yuan of his money! This could be a serious blow to the reputation of the Magnificent Jewel Hall! This was indeed an oversight made by the Magnificent Jewel Hall and Jun Mo Xie had promptly seized the opportunity to expose the flaw! While the Magnificent Jewel Hall was deliberately and unfairly making things difficult for Jun Mo Xie, he had fearlessly jumped out to question its mistakes on legitimate grounds!The hall was absolutely silent. Nobody had dared to question the legitimacy of the Magnificent Jewel Hall for hundreds of years! The exchange today had indeed been an eye-opening experience and enlightenment for many!After a long moment, the mysterious voice spoke up again, \u201cThis was indeed an oversight. I shall look into it right away.\u201d The voice remained calm but it exhibited a hint of reluctance. Everyone could easily imagine a powerful expert shaking and seething with anger while pretending as though nothing had happened.Jun Mo Xie was completely stupefied! Just a while ago, the Magnificent Jewel Hall had deliberately made things difficult for them but all of a sudden, it relinquished its claims and took back their words and actions. Why was there such a drastic change in attitude? This was strange indeed!There must be an unknown affair hidden behind the scenes!While Jun Mo Xie was deep in thought, the voice called out again, \u201cLi Zhen, you just bid 3,000,000 taels of silver. Could you please show it to us?\u201dLi Zhen and his company had been sitting comfortably and were taking joy at Jun Mo Xie and Tang Yuan\u2019s plight when Li Zhen suddenly heard his own name. He reacted swiftly, bowing deeply before answering, \u201cAfter seeing Tang Yuan upsetting the Magnificent Jewel Hall\u2019s decorum repeatedly, I could not bear any longer. Hence I came forward to expose his dark and ugly side.\u201d The voice retorted impatiently, \u201cI did not ask you the rationale behind your actions! I only wish to know whether you truly have the 3,000,000 taels of silver that you bid for.\u201dInstantly embarrassed, Li Zhen replied, \u201cI do not have 3,000,000 taels of silver but I acted merely to negate the disruptions caused by Tang Yuan and I certainly have no intentions to disturb the proceedings of the Magnificent Jewel Hall.\u201d\u201cBastard!\u201dThe voice seemed to have lost its composure completely. It did not even bother to disguise its anger. It then spoke coldly, \u201cHow dare you bid a price even without having the requisite amount of silver? How had Tang Yuan disturbed the order of the Magnificent Jewel Hall? Clearly, you are the one disrupting the proceedings! Having broken the rules of the Magnificent Jewel Hall, you must compensate for the mistakes you made. Guards, sent this man out of the Magnificent Jewel Hall now! This person is expelled from the Magnificent Jewel Hall immediately! From today onwards, the Li Family\u2019s box is cancelled and their rights to enter the Magnificent Jewel Hall will be revoked permanently!\u201dAs the voice finished speaking, several waiters appeared outside the Li Family\u2019s box. Li Zhen stood up instantly and was brought out by the guards. As someone who was extremely arrogant, he was surprisingly compliant and unresisting. He did not even bother to plead for mercy! His face was extremely pale and his body was stiff as he made his way out.Watching from the side, Jun Mo Xie felt that something was increasingly amiss! This clearly was a case of embarrassment evolving into anger. But, why did things turn out this way? Even if Li Zhen had made a mistake, it was not severe enough to revoke the entire Li Family\u2019s rights to enter the Magnificent Jewel Hall!\u201cAfter getting rid of Li Zhen, his next target would probably be Tang Yuan and me. But I\u2019d like to see how the Magnificent Jewel Hall justifies all its actions. Even if it has a thousand plots, I am not afraid! At most, Jun Family would just lose its rights to enter the Magnificent Jewel Hall. What is the big deal? If that\u2019s the case, the first thing I would do after attaining greater mastery in the Art of Unlocking Heaven\u2019s Fortune is to burn down the Magnificent Jewel Hall to ashes!\u201dWho could not see that Li Zhen had been causing trouble from the beginning? The Magnificent Jewel Hall was not foolish. Naturally, it understood the situation clearly. However, it chose to switch its attention to Li Zhen after intentionally creating trouble for Jun Mo Xie! The Magnificent Jewel Hall was obviously trying desperately to free itself from this entanglement.Suddenly, a thought struck Jun Mo Xie, \u201cDId the situation unfold this way because someone else stepped in? Was the intervention the reason why the Magnificent Jewel Hall changed its original intention? But, who is this person? Who has such great influence over the Magnificent Jewel Hall?\u201dJust as Jun Mo Xie was thinking, the voice sounded out again, loudly and distinctly such that everyone could hear it, \u201cJun Mo Xie, although it was Li Zhen who had flouted the rules of our Magnificent Jewel Hall, you are still wrong for insulting the Magnificent Jewel Hall. You showed disregard to the Magnificent Jewel Hall and you must be answerable for it!\u201d The voice was stern and seemingly angry.After a deep reflection, Jun Mo Xie was certain that the mysterious man merely wished to free the Magnificent Jewel Hall from this entanglement. Jun Mo Xie decided that it would be best if he made a strategic retreat right then and played along with the mysterious person. \u201cAt the current moment, I\u2019m still a novice without much power. However, once my cultivation of Xuan Qi reaches higher realms, the first thing I would do is to kill this bastard who has just spoken!\u201dJun Mo Xie laughed heartily and said, \u201cWhen have I insulted the Magnificent Jewel Hall? Li Zhen was schemingly causing trouble and deceiving me but thanks to the astute judgment of the Magnificent Jewel Hall, the culprit has been banished and severely punished. You are unyielding in your righteousness and the Magnificent Jewel Hall certainly deserve its reputation. I have nothing but admiration for the Magnificent Jewel Hall!\u201dThe next moment, Jun Mo Xie turned to the crowd and said loudly, \u201cHas everyone seen it? No wonder the Magnificent Jewel Hall is said to be the most righteous place on Earth! Reasonable pricing, honest dealings, fairness for all; it deserves all our respect indeed! I am extremely honored and proud to have a righteous organization like the Magnificent Jewel Hall established in the Tian Xiang Empire! Let us all cheer and applaud for the Magnificent Jewel Hall!\u201dWith a face filled with admiration and respect, Jun Mo Xie clapped loudly before speaking, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t anyone applauding for the Magnificent Jewel Hall? Do you people have different opinions? If so, then I shall speak on behalf of the Magnificent Jewel Hall!\u201dThe audience immediately broke into a thunderous applause!While the audience was applauding, they were cursing under their breath, \u201cSo shameless! Truly shameless! Jun Mo Xie is shameless to a whole new level! He is so thick-skinned that it makes me sick and ashamed!\u201dOnly Dugu Xiaoyi appeared excited and elated. Smiling happily, she clapped vigorously and enthusiastically for a long while before stopping.The mysterious voice went silent and did not utter a single word.In an elegant room within the Magnificent Jewel Hall, two white-clad middle-aged men sat facing each other. One gnashed his teeth vehemently as a sour look flashed across his face. He slammed his hand on the desk, smashing it apart, and cursed angrily, \u201cJun Mo Xie! You are a really crafty fellow! I will not spare you!\u201dThe other man closed his eyes and gave a disapproving look. He frowned and said, \u201cIt was your fault in the first place, how can you put the blame on this young man?\u201dThe first white-clad man grunted in dissatisfaction and said, \u201cBut, with the Blazing Heart Meridian, I\u2019m afraid Jun Wu Yi may\u2026\u201dThe man stopped suddenly. \u201cJun Wu Yi?\u201d His partner stood up suddenly and asked, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dThe white-clad man snorted and closed his eyes. He remained silent for a long time, while his partner stared at him, \u201cI do not care about the grudges between you and Jun Wu Yi in the past. But right now, he is already crippled and his fate is doomed! If you still have any plans to take him down, I will kill you first!\u201d His partner said this with absolute conviction and without a hint of mercy! He seemed to carry the determination and intent to follow through with what he had said!The white-clad man simply snorted again and turned away without speaking.Looked at him coldly, the partner asked suddenly, \u201cThe auction originally did not have the Blazing Heart Meridian but it suddenly appeared! What is the reason behind this? Moreover, who supplied you with this Blazing Heart Meridian? And most important of all, why must it specifically be auctioned off at Tian Xiang Empire?\u201dThe white-clad man rolled his eyes coldly and replied,\u201dIf you really want to know, why don\u2019t you ask the elders? Don\u2019t question me with such an interrogative tone. Do you really think I\u2019m afraid of you?\u201d\u201cIs it\u2026\u201d the partner\u2019s face turned grave as he continued, \u201cDid she\u2026did she\u2026specifically ordered you to send it to Jun Wu Yi as a gift? If not, why would the nine elders come today?\u201dUpon hearing this, the white-clad man\u2019s eyes snapped open and he shouted, \u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about? How can an inconsequential Jun Wu Yi worth the sacrifice of half the power of our nine elders!\u201d\u201cI did not mention anything about sacrificing the power of our nine elders! What do you mean by this?\u201d A\u00a0murderous look appeared on the partner\u2019s face as he asked, \u201cAre you playing some dirty tricks again?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cSo what? The Jun Family only spent a mere 300,000 taels of silver to buy the Blazing Heart Meridian. Isn\u2019t this the same as giving it to Jun Wu Yi directly?\u201d The white-clad man snorted.\u201cRidiculous! What use is there if he only has the Blazing Heart Meridian! Without a Divine Xuan expert controlling the process, Jun Wu Wi will only die faster under the extreme poison of the Blazing Heart Meridian!\u201d The partner was shaking in anger. \u201cYou are such a despicable man! I will kill you!\u201d\u201cEnough!\u201dAnother voice thundered from afar. Surreal and nebulous, it sounded old yet stern. \u201cThere is no need to argue any further!\u201dThe two stared daggers at each other for a long moment. After a while, both snorted and sat back down facing away from each other, each not uttering another wordPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Clasping his hands together, he started to bow at the audience while laughing boisterously, \u201cThank you! Thank you, everybody, for your support of the Magnificent Jewel Hall. I am extremely grateful and honored to share the moment with everyone today. May I hereby announce that the auction continues. Please feel free to bid. There is no need to be polite.\u201d\u201cWhat on earth are you? You speak as though you are a manager of the Magnificent Jewel Hall. You are absolutely incorrigible!\u201d Everyone was cursing Jun Mo Xie under their breaths.If the contemptuous glare directed at Jun Mo Xie could inflict harm on him, Jun Mo Xie would probably be sustaining thousands of wounds all over his body by now!The mysterious voice was no longer heard again. However, another voice sounded out clearly after some time, \u201cLi Zhen\u2019s bid for the Blazing Heart Meridian has been deemed invalid as he was unable to produce the amount he bid for. The auction shall continue with the last price!\u201d\u201cThere were two people indeed!\u201d Jun Mo Xie thought and smiled. \u201cThere must have been a disagreement between the two of them. I guess the latter person must have been more powerful than the previous one.\u201dThe expression of the purple-robed auctioneer on stage changed to one of frustration. He continued, \u201cThe Blazing Heart Meridian was previously bid on by Tang Yuan for 300,000 taels of silver. I had called the price twice. Is there anyone who is willing to offer more than 300,000?\u201dDespite asking repeatedly, nobody responded. Not to mention the events that happened earlier, who would dare to offend the fearless and audacious Jun Mo Xie and the fearsome grandfather of Tang Yuan who doted on his grandson?\u201c300,000 taels of silver, going thrice! Sold!\u201dWhen the purple-robed auctioneer slammed the hammer down, he was feeling extremely disturbed and uncomfortable. He had been hosting auctions for decades but he had never felt so depressed before. Because of two incorrigible youngsters, the auction process had been completely overturned! This item could have easily reached the price of 1,000,000 taels of silver but in the end, it was being sold for a mere 300,000! After taking into account the cost of procuring the Blazing Heart Meridian, this was akin to giving it away!Fatty Tang was momentarily overjoyed even though did not understand what was actually going on half of the time. Fortunately, Jun Mo Xie was able to keep calm and return this shameless man a few tight slaps on his face!Sitting across them, Dugu Xiaoyi curled her lips before saying angrily, \u201cThere is simply no justice here! This guy actually succeeded in obtaining the rare herb at such a low price! It is truly repulsive! I hate this!\u201d While her words seemed spiteful, her big beautiful eyes actually transformed into two crescent moons. She seemed to be laughing happily from the bottom of her heart as though there was not the faintest hint of revulsion in her.Princess Ling Meng looked suspiciously at Dugu Xiaoyi who suddenly seemed to be in high spirits. With her lips pursed, Dugu Xiaoyi was staring fondly at Jun Mo Xie as he unleashed his plots. Dugu Xiaoyi no longer had the look of disgust that hung on her face in the past but instead, she was filled with appreciation and admiration! What was happening?Suddenly, a bizarre thought struck Princess Ling Meng. She could not help but ask in shock, \u201cXiaoyi, you\u2026you\u2026did you actually take a fancy to this prodigal man?\u201dHearing this, Dugu Xiaoyi\u2019s face flushed deeply as she stuck out her tongue. Undoubtedly blushing, she denied desperately, \u201cDid I? How can I take fancy to a prodigal man like him? I can\u2019t wait to hang him in my room and strike him with a whip. How dare he steal my meteorite iron? He is too bold! If I don\u2019t teach him a lesson, how can I vent the frustration in my heart? I will teach him a lesson the moment I found the right opportunity!\u201d As she said this, she lifted her eyebrow fiercely and clenched her jaws tightly.Princess Ling Meng was completely helpless when she heard these words. Being a close confidant of Dugu Xiaoyi for so many years, how could she not see through her internal thoughts? Xiaoyi was clearly euphoric but was simply trying to feign anger. Her inner thoughts were so obvious that anyone could have seen it instantly.Thinking back, Princess Ling Meng remembered that Dugu Xiaoyi had been depressed previously. However, she suddenly seemed to turn lively and energetic upon hearing Jun Mo Xie\u2019s voice! All of these were self-evident and it could only lead to one possibility! This possibility was so inconceivable that it was tantamount to a nightmare!\u201cSister Dugu Xiaoyi! Oh my\u2026\u201d After forcing a stern look for an ephemeral moment, Dugu Xiaoyi broke into an uncontrollable smile, causing Princess Ling Meng to become even more worried. \u201cXiaoyi, you\u2026you\u2026 He is such a hooligan, how could you\u2026 how could you have fallen for him just like this?\u201dDugu Xiaoyi blinked her big pretty eyes twice and hummed happily before saying, \u201cBecause he is such a hooligan, all he needs is a good lesson. I shall let him know how powerful I am. Hehe\u2026\u201d As she finished, Dugu Xiaoyi could not help but laugh. Her eyes were full of longing, seemingly thinking about how she would go about teaching Jun Mo Xie a lesson.Princess Ling Meng grew increasingly worried about this issue. \u201cThis is no trivial matter! Even though Dugu Xiaoyi only herself has herself to blame, General Dugu Wudi must know about this as soon as possible!\u201dDugu Xiaoyi is the sole daughter of the Dugu Family who was doted upon and well-liked by everyone! To match her with the good-for-nothing son of the Jun Family would be akin to sticking a lovely flower in a pile of cow dung! It would be an utter degradation of such a precious and lovely being!\u201cFrom the political perspective, matching the only grandson of the Jun Family\u2019s Third Generation and the granddaughter of the Dugu Family would be an undesirable outcome that would inevitably trigger a severe political turmoil! Therefore, I must stop this! I must never let Dugu Xiaoyi fall into the hands of Jun Mo Xie!\u201d As the complicated thoughts ran through Princess Ling Meng, she cast Dugu Xiaoyi and Jun Mo Xie a glance before finally making up her mind silently.Jun Mo Xie was extremely excited to have obtained the Blazing Heart Meridian at such a low price but at the same time, he had also grown solemn upon the rare appearance of the two masters at the Magnificent Jewel Hall. \u201cI am not strong enough to fight these strong opponents yet. I may have to just remain patient and clown around for now.\u201dAfterwards, Tang Yuan easily bought the item requested by Grandfather Tang. It was a scroll about the Sacred Wind Sword Art! Jun Mo Xie took a quick glance at it before handing it back to Tang Yuan apathetically. His heart was filled with condescension. He could not believe such inferior sword art manual could even be auctioned, and Tang Yuan actually spent 2,000,000 taels of silver to acquire it!Suddenly, something alarmed Jun Mo Xie. A look of surprise was cast over his face!After obtaining the Blazing Heart Meridian, he had sent out his spiritual awareness out to monitor the two princes\u2019 boxes in which the six suspicious people had entered. However, he was surprised to find out that both boxes were completely empty at the moment! There was absolutely no one in them but no one had walked out of the doors either. It seemed as if the inhabitants had vanished! However, Jun Mo Xie was certain that these six people did not leave the Magnificent Jewel Hall. Could it be possible that there were secret underground passageways beneath those two boxes?\u201dThe next moment, Jun Mo Xie detected a trace of lingering spiritual energy blended in the crowded mass below. Looking in the direction, he realized that those people had completely changed their clothes and their facial appearances! Even if one were to scrutinize their faces, it would be impossible to relate them to the earlier six people who had entered the two boxes!Three of them gathered in the middle of the hall while the other three stationed on the opposite side of the hall. It was as though a distinct dichotomy existed between the two factions. They all appeared like wealthy businessmen, but their twitching eyes easily allowed Jun Mo Xie to read the anxiety and desire burning in their hearts.It seemed that the object which they had anticipated for was about to appear on auction! But among all the items auctioned, what could actually be valuable enough to grab the attention of these two teams of assassins, to the extent that even both Princes are involved?Jun Mo Xie took the auction list from Fatty Tang and started scanning the items that were being auctioned. After going through the entire list, his eyes finally landed on the last item in the list. It was 30 strips of tendons from a rank 6 Xuan Beast, the White-Horned Bull!Xuan Beast\u2019s tendons!They must be after this item! Apart from this item, the rest of the items on the list were merely luxurious decorations and other small collectables that did not have much practical value. None of these items seemed to be of interest to these killers. They probably needed something formidable and life-threatening.The Xuan Beast\u2019s tendons seemed to meet such requirements! \u201cBut why do they need so many tendons? They can\u2019t be thinking of using whips as their weapons, can they?\u201d\u201cOr are they trying to build even more powerful bows?\u201dAt this point in time, Jun Mo Xie\u2019s heart started to race.If the tendons of a rank 6 Xuan Beast were used to build bows, then the arrows released from such bows would have twice the power of those released from usual bows! However, such bows and arrows would be incredibly powerful for one to wield. Even a rank 9 Xuan cultivator would not have sufficient strength to draw the bow!However, if the wielders were Silver or Gold Xuan experts, such a weapon would become an absolutely lethal weapon! Even a Jade Xuan expert might meet his end at the hands of such a powerful bow user if he was caught by surprise! Furthermore, a group consisting of more than ten such bow users would surely have the capacity to pose a threat to Sky Xuan masters!It seemed like this was what they were thinking!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSure enough, the moment the Xuan Beast\u2019s tendon appeared, the groups belonging to the two princes immediately began to bid aggressively against each other! It culminated in a fierce competition between the two factions! Prices continued to soar and before long it reached a whopping 5,000,000 taels of silver! At this price, most of the competitors had already given up and backed out of this bidding war. However, with just the two factions remaining, neither party was willing to concede at all!After a long bidding process, the price of the 30 strips of Xuan Beast\u2019s tendons eventually rose to an exorbitant price of 13,000,000 taels of silver! It was eventually obtained by one of the Princes\u2019 killer group! This price can be considered one of the highest prices in all the auctions at the Magnificent Jewel Hall in recent years!\u201cJun Mo Xie, as you can see, this is just the tendons of a rank 6 Xuan Beast. If it were 30 pieces of rank 6 Xuan Pill, I\u2019m afraid the price would have been a few times higher. Jun Mo Xie, do you realize how important was the item lost by my family now?\u201d Tang Yuan whined, \u201cIt is simply priceless!\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Jun Mo Xie replied indifferently. His attention was fixated on the three men who had rushed frantically out of the dispersing crowd upon receiving the Xuan Beast\u2019s tendons. Since the assassination attempt Jun Mo Xie encountered with these people, he knew that they probably dared to face off his grandfather, a Sky Xuan realm master, if they ever needed to. However, he knew that despite being a Sky Xuan master, his grandfather would probably face life-threatening danger when fighting against these powerful bow users.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Jun Mo Xie stood up, still deep in thoughts. \u201cIf I can track these people, I may be able to find out whose hands these items would end up in. Perhaps, that would be more ideal.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After the old fellow sent him back, he had to leave immediately for some urgent matters and would not return for another six months! If he was around, his unparalleled tracking skills would certainly have come in handy right now\u2026Jun Mo Xie looked over at his own guards. These men were specially picked by Grandfather Jun himself. With a Gold Xuan user and seven Silver Xuan users, their strength was considered quite impressive. At least in the Tian Xiang Empire, they were sufficient to protect Jun Mo Xie from most threats. \u201cAs though I even need them for protection.\u201dHowever, Jun Mo Xie knew that it would be irrational to order these men to track the movements of those killers.Even if these men managed to keep up and catch up to them,\u00a0they would simply become eight corpses in the blink of an eye! According to Jun Mo Xie, each of the three men had been at the pinnacle of the Gold Xuan realm cultivation. In addition, they were all professional killers.However, once a threat had been discovered, it must be exterminated instantly! It would be foolish to stay passive and allow the threat to grow stronger!\u201cNo matter what, I must find a way to trace these people! I must least lay my hands on those Xuan Beast\u2019s tendons! Even if I can\u2019t obtain them, I must find ways to destroy them! After all, the consequences which these weapons can bring about are far too disastrous!\u201dAs the thought of killing grew in Jun Mo Xie, he involuntarily released a dense killing intent into his dispersed spiritual sense!Suddenly, Jun Mo Xie felt an enormous spiritual pressure descending upon him. The spiritual pressure drifted towards him directly, following the trail of his own killing intent. Its target was clearly and undeniably Jun Mo Xie himself. It was so precise that even Tang Yuan, who was standing right beside him, did not sense any difference in the atmosphere at all!This spiritual sense was far more powerful than the two mysterious characters who spoke in the Magnificent Jewel Hall earlier!This strong spiritual sense surprised Jun Mo Xie immensely! \u201cThis mysterious master from the Magnificent Jewel Hall is certainly far stronger than Grandfather Jun Zhan Tian! Could this actually be the legendary Divine Xuan master himself?\u201dJun Mo Xie could vaguely guess the rationale for the appearance of this spiritual sense. When the three killers left the auction hall, he had dispersed his spiritual sense in the hope of tracking them. However, when he released his killing intent, it led to the fluctuation of his spiritual sense. This fluctuation, containing a faint killing intent, must have been felt by this mysterious master instantly!Due to the nature of Jun Mo Xie\u2019s Xuan Qi, experts below the Divine Xuan realm were absolutely unable to detect his spiritual sense! Hence, Jun Mo Xie simply used it without second thoughts. Little did he expect himself to be caught! It was evident that the strength of this mysterious man was certainly exceptional!However, the Magnificent Jewel Hall had always been concerned about the items available for auctions. Since Jun Mo Xie was clearly tracking a departing guest, it was not surprising for him to be found out, especially by the powerful spiritual sense of a formidable master!However, Jun Mo Xie was very certain that this man had only detected his spiritual sense but had not been able to identify him as Jun Mo Xie! To identify him, the opposing party must have a spiritual sense that was similar to the nature of his! Jun Mo Xie firmly believed that his Art of Unlocking Heaven\u2019s Fortune was unique in this world! Therefore he was confident that he had not exposed his identity despite exposing his killing intent!Yet at this moment, the strong suppressive force was still weighing down on Jun Mo Xie. Jun Mo Xie felt uneasy. \u201cIf I do not fight back, my psychological state will be severely damaged. However, even if I retaliate or defend using my spiritual awareness, it will stand no chance against the potent force of the enemy\u2019s spiritual awareness. Although mine is unique and mystical, the opponent\u2019s was far stronger than mine! What should I do?\u201dWhile he was deliberating, the strong spiritual sense was rapidly closing in on Jun Mo Xie!At the final moment, the Exquisite Hongjun Pagoda suddenly started rotating at full speed deep inside Jun Mo Xie\u2019s consciousness. At the same time, it emanated a rainbow-colored brilliant light in all directions, engulfing his consciousness in a whirling stream of Qi. Jun Mo Xie could feel this force gradually approaching and confronting the oppressive force that was closing in on him.As the strong spiritual sense came crashing down on him, the light from the Exquisite Hongjun Pagoda intercepted it. In the brief moment, the foreign spiritual sense seemed like a little snowflake falling on a red-hot stove. It disappeared without a trace! Not even a single remnant of it remained!This ancient treasure was a relic left behind by the powerful deity Hua Xia. How can the mere strengths of an ordinary Spirit Xuan expert be compared to the immense power of this legendary artifact that had existed since the beginning of time? Even if all the Spirit Xuan experts in this world gather together, they would simply be a piece of cake for the enigmatic Exquisite Hongjun Pagoda!The light from the Exquisite Hongjun Pagoda slowly withdrew. As it disappeared, Jun Mo Xie simultaneously disabled his spiritual awareness.However, only Jun Mo Xie himself understood perfectly everything that just occurred. Even the mysterious expert who had been counterattacked was clueless about what exactly just happened!In a hidden underground chamber within the Magnificent Jewel Hall, an old man sat cross-legged with his eyes completely closed. All of a sudden, he shuddered violently and his eyes opened swiftly. A look of disbelief filled his eyes. Apprehension and horror were drawn across his face as beads of cold sweat started pouring down his forehead.After all, he was a Divine Xuan expert himself. But while his spiritual sense was oppressing someone, the opposing party had effortlessly repelled and nullified it! It seemed as if his spiritual power was just an inconsequential speck of dust in the eyes of the opponent! What did this imply?\u201cPeak of the Divine Xuan realm! Only a person at the peak of the Divine Xuan realm would be able to nullify my spiritual pressure with such ease and yet escape my detection. It is the only possible way to explain this situation!\u201d The white-haired old man cried in shock, \u201cWhy would there be such a potent figure in Tian Xiang Empire? Is a storm imminent in Tian Xiang Empire?\u201d\u201cJun Mo Xie!\u201d A clear and distinct voice rang out. Jun Mo Xie turned and was surprised to find Dugu Xiaoyi walking over with a fierce look on her. \u201cOh\u2026so you are not\u2026yet.\u201d She was about to say \u2018you are not dead yet\u2019 but she could not bring herself to say it. The word \u2018dead\u2019 seemed morbid and inauspicious. As such, she was extremely reluctant to associate this word with Jun Mo Xie even if it was meant to be a joke.\u201cOh it is Miss Dugu Xiaoyi,\u201d Jun Mo Xie smiled as he studied her. \u201cAfter not seeing Miss Dugu for so long, you seem to have become more beautiful! You simply make my heart melt.\u201dOverhearing the conversation, Tang Yuan was taken aback! He could not help but stare at Jun Mo Xie. \u201cJun Mo Xie, how could you even have the guts to flirt with this young lady? Have you not gotten enough beatings previously?\u201dEven Jun Mo Xie\u2019s grandfather, a Sky Xuan master and an expert at fighting, only held the second place in his heart. The most cherished person in Jun Mo Xie\u2019s heart had always been the vicious and heartless Dugu Xiaoyi. This was something Tang Yuan knew very well.However, the subsequent events almost let Fatty Tang believe this was all a dream. Dugu Xiaoyi was surprisingly not angered by Jun Mo Xie\u2019s ridiculous words. Instead, she blushed slightly and her fierce expression was completely erased. She looked down shyly and asked, \u201cReally? Do I really look more beautiful than before? Why do I not realize it when I have been looking in the mirror every day?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWhat?\u201d Tang Yuan groaned and momentarily lost his balance. \u201cWhat am I hearing? Is this even Dugu Xiaoyi? Could she be her twin sister or something?\u201dJun Mo Xie also broke into a cold sweat and was momentarily stunned. \u201cWhat tricks is she playing\u00a0today?\u201d Nodding slowly he forced a reply, \u201cYes, yes. It\u2019s true, it\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cI must have slimmed down successfully! I shall continue to lose weight and slim down even more!\u201d Dugu Xiaoyi jumped excitedly. But as she landed, a thought seemed to come to her mind. The next moment, she glared viciously at Jun Mo Xie with her large eyes and snapped, \u201cJun Mo Xie! What did you just say? How dare you try to take advantage of me? Have you lost your mind? You\u2019ve really gotten bold!\u201dJun Mo Xie was increasingly certain that something was wrong with this girl today. With her attitude switching between the extreme ends, she was certainly making things difficult for him.The next moment, there was a motion from beneath Dugu Xiaoyi\u2019s arms. A small, snow-white head stuck out. It had small ears, a small nose, a small mouth, a lovely pink tongue and an adorable pair of eyes. Waving its little paws wildly, the little creature could easily melt the hearts of anyone seeing it.\u201cA Xuan Beast! Oh my God!\u201d Tang Yuan screamed as his eyes widened, \u201cAn Iron Winged Panther\u2019s cub!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It could crush iron with its legs, move at blinding speeds and was exceptionally intelligent! A full-grown Iron Winged Panther would be powerful enough to confront Sky Xuan realm experts. If its potential was fully realized, an Iron Winged Panther could easily rival ordinary rank 8 Xuan Beasts! Such a high-level Xuan Beast\u2019s cub was truly uncommon and Jun Mo Xie had never expected that Dugu Xiaoyi would actually own one.By looking at its barely one-foot long body, it was obvious that this creature was a newborn cub of an Iron Winged Panther! The Dugu family was undoubtedly large and powerful to be in possession of such a rare creature. It even bestowed it as a pet to their beloved daughter! Right now, the little Iron Winged Panther cub was trying to climb out of Dugu Xiaoyi\u2019s arms. A pair of dark eyes looked right into Jun Mo Xie\u2019s, unexpectedly carrying a look of desire!\u201cBe good Snowy, don\u2019t struggle. Sister will feed you some good food in a while.\u201d Dugu Xiaoyi was very surprised. This little creature was obtained by her father with considerable effort three days ago. Dugu Xiaoyi had fallen in love with it at first sight. As it was being separated from its mother since young, the Panther was generally weaker and tended to lay in her embrace without moving much. However, why did it struggled so strongly to climb out of her arms today?\u201cSo, he is called Snowy?\u201d Jun Mo Xie took just one look at it, smiled and commented, \u201cWhat a cute little thing.\u201d Jun Mo Xie was not particularly interested in beasts. After dropping a casual indifferent remark, he turned and started to leave. After all, he still needed to track down the whereabouts of the mysterious killers.Seeing Jun Mo Xie turning to leave, the little Iron Winged Panther started screeching suddenly, \u201cGrr\u2026Grr\u2026\u201d It was struggling anxiously in Dugu Xiaoyi\u2019s arms and trying to break free from her embrace. Its four pink paws clawed the air in front of it frantically and it seemed to be looking earnestly in the direction of Jun Mo Xie!\u201cThis little guy seems to like you.\u201d Dugu Xiaoyi was astounded as she watched with large round eyes. Since she received this Iron Winged Panther cub, she had always brought it with her whenever she was eating, drinking or sleeping. But never had Dugu Xiaoyi seen it displaying such affection for anyone! Why had it reacted in such a manner after seeing Jun Mo Xie? This was bizarre indeed!\u201cBut I don\u2019t really like it.\u201d Jun Mo Xie frowned and glanced at the \u2018Rank 7 High-Level Xuan Beast\u2019. He shook his head sympathetically and thought, \u201cUnfortunately, this creature is too small. Even if its size is doubled, it would hardly be enough for a pot of stew!\u201dDugu Xiaoyi snorted. She did not like the way Jun Mo Xie spoke. She hesitated for a moment. Seeing Snowy\u2019s extreme longing to go to him, she could not help it but carry the cub towards Jun Mo Xie and begged, \u201cSnowy really likes you very much. Could you please hold it for a moment and pacify it? In return, I\u2019ll forgive you for taking advantage of me previously.\u201dAs the cub got closer and closer to Jun Mo Xie, it seemed more and more excited and started chirping happily, \u201cWoo\u2026Woo\u2026\u201d It stretched out a soft tiny paw towards Jun Mo Xie like a baby holding out its arms for an adult to hug it. Its eyes were filled with longing and joy.Hesitating for a moment, Jun Mo Xie sighed. This distraction would prevent him from tracking down the three killers but there seemed no way out of this. He reluctantly held out his hand and received the cub.As the Panther got into Jun Mo Xie\u2019s arm, a pleased look appeared on its face! It stretched its legs comfortably and peered around dreamily. It sniffed Jun Mo Xie eagerly and released a satisfied growl with its pink tongue hanging out! Snuggling its head into Jun Mo Xie\u2019s arm, and taking his chest as its pillow, the creature went straight to sleep! Its actions seemed to suggest that it was planning to stay in Jun Mo Xie\u2019s embrace for long!Dugu Xiaoyi stared disbelievingly at Jun Mo Xie with her big pretty eyes. What was happening? Ever since Snowy had been adopted by the Dugu Family and handed over to Dugu Xiaoyi, it seemed to have recognized Dugu Xiaoyi as its master. Although they had not invited an animal trainer to officially help the creature recognize its owner, the cub had no longer tried to resist Dugu Xiaoyi. It did not even bother to give any attention to others around Dugu Xiaoyi. Even Dugu Wuyi, the one who carried it back to the Dugu family, was not spared from this cold treatment!How had it gotten so close to Jun Mo Xie after their first meeting? This is just too strange!In fact, even Jun Mo Xie found this matter extremely inexplicable and thought that there was more to this than meets the eye. However, looking helplessly at the creature that had just settled cozily in its new-found home, Jun Mo Xie said smilingly, \u201cIs this the legendary Xuan Beast that will only recognize one master during its lifetime and be extremely faithful to him? A rank 7 high-level Xuan Beast? Why does it seem easier to abduct than a normal puppy? Myths cannot be believed!\u201dDugu Xiaoyi blushed and was deeply embarrassed. She advanced angrily towards Jun Mo Xie to snatch the little cub from the hands of Jun Mo Xie. \u201cThis guy is outrageous! I have already chosen to forgive him for taking advantage of me earlier but here he is, trying to embarrass me openly! Incorrigible!\u201dHowever\u2026An inconceivable scene occurred. Seeing Dugu Xiaoyi stretching her arms to pick it up, the Iron Winged Panther cub suddenly glared at her with eyes filled with hostility. Despite not having many teeth, it opened its jaws wide and growled repeatedly at Dugu Xiaoyi as though trying to intimidate a hostile figure. Its tiny tender paws held on tightly to Jun Mo Xie\u2019s clothes and it seemed extremely reluctant to leave the stranger whom it had only encountered for the first time!Dugu Xiaoyi wrapped her hands around the cub\u2019s body and tried to pull it away. However, Snowy\u2019s four little paws were so strongly held onto Jun Mo Xie that even his clothes tore a little. Yelping wildly, the cub was evidently reluctant to leave Jun Mo Xie\u2019s side.Dugu Xiaoyi pondered for a moment before looking up at Jun Mo Xie in shock and uttering bluntly, \u201cJun Mo Xie, are you its mom?\u201dJun Mo Xie\u2019s forehead was suddenly filled with black lines!\u201cWhat kind of ridiculous statement is this? If I\u2019m its mom, won\u2019t I be a beast?\u201dNot to mention Dugu Xiaoyi and Tang Yuan\u2019s confusion, even Jun Mo Xie himself was mystified by what just happened. In fact, the Qi from the Exquisite Hongjun Pagoda in him had already transformed his body into something different. Coupled with the extraordinary effects from his cultivation of the Art of Unlocking Heaven\u2019s Fortune, Jun Mo Xie\u2019s body was far better than anything imagined. It was brimming with the purest essence of Qi from the entire universe.This worldly Qi would generally go unnoticed for normal people and ordinary level Xuan Beasts. However, for high-level Xuan Beasts like the Iron Winged Panther, it was one of the most crucial nourishment essential for their growth! Especially for this young high-level Xuan Beast, it was simply an irresistible temptation!After a prolonged struggle, the cub was finally peeled off Jun Mo Xie, leaving behind two large holes on his torn clothes! Ignoring the cub\u2019s anxious cries, he threw the cub back to Dugu Xiaoyi\u2019s arms. \u201cThere you go. Please hold on to it carefully.\u201dDugu Xiaoyi fumbled to catch it and then snapped at Jun Mo Xie angrily, \u201cCan\u2019t you handle it more gently? What if it falls?\u201dDugu Xiaoyi held the cub in her arms, while it cried anxiously and struggled to break free of her grasp. It looked at Jun Mo Xie sadly as tears rolled down its small face. Disappointment and a trace of indignation filled its eyes. Seeing this, Dugu Xiaoyi\u2019s heart melted again and she decided that she should pacify it by handing it over to Jun Mo Xie for a short while. Jun Mo Xie was bewildered! He quickly hopped out of the way and stood a distance away from Dugu Xiaoyi, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s getting late. I shall take my leave first.\u201d He then turned and walked away.Dugu Xiaoyi stamped her foot and cursed spitefully. She suddenly turned to the cub in her arms and reprimanded it, \u201cIt\u2019s all your fault! You are so useless! Is he even your mom or your dad?\u201dThe Iron Winged Panther opened its eyes and looked at her innocently. It suddenly lowered its head despondently, as though Jun Mo Xie\u2019s departure had been a massive loss for it. It whined pitifully and lay motionless and listlessly in Dugu Xiaoyi\u2019s arms.\u201cOkay, okay. At most I\u2019ll take you to him to play in the next few days.\u201d Dugu Xiaoyi finally said in an attempt to cajole the cub. The cub was still far too young to understand human language and naturally could not fathom what Dugu Xiaoyi was saying. Hence it did not respond at all. However, it was Dugu Xiaoyi herself who reacted to her own words. After uttering those few words, she suddenly felt a hint of joy, as well as a sense of uneasiness. She was not too sure why she was feeling that way herself.\u201cOh? Where is Princess Ling Meng? She clearly came out together with me, why has she suddenly disappeared?\u201d Realizing that her sister was lost, she frowned anxiously. Feeling a little surprised, she grumbled, \u201cShe didn\u2019t even notify me before she left\u2026This is too much!\u201dJun Mo Xie bid farewell to Tang Yuan and proceeded to walk away in the direction of the Jun Family\u2019s residence with his guards. After turning at an intersection, he found a big sedan stopped before him. It was guarded by dozens of strong guards who were much more powerful than the previous formation. Standing at the front was a single, lonely and somewhat desolate figure, Ye Gu Han!Princess Ling Meng was actually waiting for him here!\u201cIs Princess Ling Meng, Her Royal Highness, meeting me in person? Even if we do not wish to meet, it seems we are fated to meet.\u201d Jun Mo Xie raised his eyebrows in surprise. As he spoke, Ye Gu Han\u2019s vicious gaze was directed straight at him. Listening to his glib rhetoric words, he could not help but frown.\u201cJun Mo Xie, I actually came to you for something serious.\u201d Princess Ling Meng alighted from the sedan chair slowly. Her expression was cold, and her slender eyebrows were slightly raised in repulsion. Her face seemed to cause a freezing chill to others.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cShe has come to me for something serious? Is there even anything not serious for me? If you have something to request for, you should at least request for it formally instead of showing me this cold attitude!\u201d Jun Mo Xie cursed in his heart, but he put on a smile before saying, \u201cHer Highness has travelled so far to meet me. Please go ahead and state your request. Regardless of whether it is a serious matter or not, I will try my best to help. Oh! Has the Princess finally decided to respond to my infatuation and going to ask me to be your consort? It seems the Heaven has finally taken pity on me and granted me my wishes\u2026\u201d Jun Mo Xie blurted out a string of gibberish!Ye Gu Han snorted angrily and glared murderously at Jun Mo Xie, \u201cSuch impudence! How dare you utter such nonsense! Truly presumptuous!\u201d\u201cSuch impudence! How dare you utter such nonsense! Truly presumptuous!\u201d Jun Mo Xie rebuked with the exact same words. \u201cWhat are you? I am discussing some serious matter with Her Highness. There is no place for you to interfere!\u201dOf course, Jun Mo Xie would not put Ye Gu Han in his eyes. Ye Gu Han had left the deepest impression on him after that particular day. It was not because of his fighting skills, but because he had praised the leader of the killing crew who took his own life a \u201cTrue Man\u201d. Jun Mo Xie felt that the praise showed nothing but corruption and cowardice. Therefore, he only showed contempt and despise towards Ye Gu Han.As Jun Mo Xie spoke, the surrounding atmosphere suddenly turned cold and still. A chilling aura had permeated the area. This was the preamble to Ye Gu Han\u2019s explosive rampage! With his cold gaze fixed on Jun Mo Xie, it seemed Ye Gu Han was determined to kill this brat!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When Jun Mo Xie was previously injured, Grandfather Jun had already caused a bloodbath in the capital. If he were to be killed by Ye Gu Han\u2026the consequences would be too horrendous to consider.Although Ye Gu Han was a Sky Xuan expert, he would only be a piece of paper in front of Jun Zhan Tian. This was even if his strength were to increase by a single fold and he had to go all-out. Either way, it was not worth it to lose his life for this young debauchee.Princess Ling Ming took two steps forward and asked Jun Mo Xie, \u201cJun Mo Xie, please follow me over to the side. I have something important to tell you.\u201d Ye Gu Han closely followed behind her like a shadow, not leaving for even a moment. It was apparently that he did not trust Jun Mo Xie a single bit.It was at this moment that Jun Mo Xie suddenly sensed a familiar chill in his heart rise and then quickly disappeared. This was the same killing intent that locked onto Jun Mo Xie in the Magnificent Jewel Hall!Jun Mo Xie then contemplated in his heart. But why are they here? They did not leave after obtaining the Xuan Beast tendons. Don\u2019t tell me they want to assassinate the princess in broad daylight?Anyhow, the killing intent of three assassins could be clearly detected coming from around the street corner. And contrary to expectations, Jun Mo Xie had a feeling of seeing a light at the end of the tunnel. After having been delayed twice, he was certain that he would not be able to catch up to those three. He certainly did not expect that he would accidentally bump heads with them again so soon. This truly must be fate.He looked at the several bodyguards behind him. If these men followed along, not to mention tracking others, perhaps they would be discovered before they can even be able to take two steps. After giving it some thought, an idea slowly begun to develop in Jun Mo Xie\u2019s mind.Although Jun Mo Xie does not know why these killers ended up here, it\u2019s clear that the other party had not moved a step after discovering Princess Ling Meng\u2019s entourage. There is no doubt about it. The reason they paused was that they had detected Ye Gu Han\u2019s formidable Sky Xuan presence and so they did not dare to act rashly.\u201cYou wait here first. The princess and I have important matters to discuss.\u201d Jun Mo Xie explained while looking at his bodyguards with a serious face. \u201cThe princess and I still have to exchange caresses and whisper some affectionate words. Don\u2019t disturb our serious business.\u201dHearing these truly shameless words, the leader of the bodyguards was gaping and speechless while staring at him. Eventually, he bowed his head in consent. \u201cY-Yes, young master.\u201d Just three short words had almost caused him to stutter three times.The leader was secretly cursing in his heart. You caressing and whispering sweet words with the princess? Young master, you truly are thick skinned! Look at how the royal princess is glaring at you with those chilling eyes as if she wants to freeze you to death! I\u2019m afraid the truth is that you are going to suffer masochistic abuse but don\u2019t want us to witness your humiliation. We also have better things to do so why would we even want to follow you this time? Something serious? Do you dare to say that you have done even one serious thing since you were born until now!?Jun Mo Xie walked forward with Princess Ling Ming. In his mind, he sensed that just as his entourage of bodyguards moved forward, the three assassins across the street had begun to move as well. By the time Jun Mo Xie had turned the street corner, the three assassins had already proceeded a few dozen zhangs down the street. But it seems that this just so happened to be their destination since it seemed as if they had no intention of leaving.By now, Ye Gu Han had long detected their presence, and he hid a frown. Although he was not aware that the other party were assassins, it is apparent from the spiritual power fluctuations that the other party had a high level of Xuan cultivation. Even though he doesn\u2019t know their intentions, he had already placed his right hand upon his sword hilt. If they have any sudden movements, Ye Gu Han will immediately exterminate these three men!Concerning the safety of Princess Ling Ming, Ye Gu Han will never allow an accident to happen!A Sky Xuan level existence can act with impunity in a place like Tianxiang City.\u201cJun Mo Xie, I have a warning for you.\u201d Princess Ling Ming\u2019s charming figure finally came to a stopped. She knitted her brows, apparently organizing her thoughts as she thought of a way in approaching this difficult subject.\u201cRoyal Princess please speak frankly. I\u2019m all ears.\u201d Jun Mu Xie\u2019s back has moved against the wall, with one leg bent such that his feet propped up against the wall. After raising one arm, lowering the other, and then tilting his head, he gazed at Princess Ling Ming. A truly a sloppy, frivolous, indecent and despicable appearance.Ye Gu Han could not stand looking at him like this, the spitting image of a street bum, and snorted before turning away. He would rather not look at this eyesore\u2019s shameful display. In his heart, he pitied Jun Zhan Tian, a hero of a generation, for having such a good for nothing as his sole heir! Truly regrettable! It seems that the Jun Family\u2019s decline is already a matter of certainty. How unfortunate for a family that has sacrificed so much for their country!Jun Mo Xie gave the same spiteful snort in his heart. You\u2019re supposed to be a Sky Xuan expert, but compared to me, your big brother, you are too inexperienced and lack even the most basic of vigilance.Even though this young master appearance resembled a street bum or a dog taking a piss, but this leg is propped up against the wall can let me react appropriately to any sudden changes and dodge at any time. With the slightest exertion, no matter from which direction, from the sky or down below, I can still secure a path of retreat for myself.With each arm raised and lowered, it is a lot easier to maintain my balance which would be advantageous under any circumstance!Even if a Supreme Divine Xuan expert were to appear in front of me right now and wanted to kill me, I\u2019m confident I can still escape so long as I can push off against the wall with my leg! But look at you, a Sky Xuan expert who is unable to understand the function of this form and turned away earlier. If this young master had the mind to take the life of this daydreaming little girl, that split second would have been more than enough to kill her three times over! What a moron! And to think this bodyguard have the belief that he is responsible and diligent\u2014truly tragic and laughable!\u201cJun Mo Xie, Lady Dugu is my closest and best friend, and so\u2026\u201d Princess Ling Ming paused and bit her lips, feeling a little embarrassed. But the thought that Dugu Xiao Yi\u2019s lifelong happiness was currently in the hands of this frivolous debauchee in front of her, she gained her resolve and blurted out in one breath. \u201c\u2026And so, I don\u2019t want you to harass Xiao Yi again in the future\u2026playing around way too much, you\u2026understand what I mean?\u201d\u201cThis Jun Mo Xie does not understand.\u201d Jun Mo Xie shook his head as if startled and started sweating profusely. \u201cThis lowly debauchee does not have your royal princess\u2019 profound knowledge; therefore, the words princess spoke is too difficult for me to understand. Forgive this one\u2019s ignorance. Might I suggest your royal princess make your words as clear and direct as possible?\u201dJun Mo Xie was speaking the truth and was not just playing dumb. If he were the original Jun Mo Xie, he would have immediately understood. But having never been in a relationship in his previous life, he had not realized Dugu Xiao Yi\u2019s feelings for him until now. He had already been in a depressed state as from having to constantly avoid that bipolar and unruly female. Hearing what Princess Ling Ming said about this taboo subject was like hearing news from hell!\u201cJun Mo Xie! There\u2019s no point in acting dumb. Do you really not understand what I\u2019m saying?!\u201d Princess Ling Ming frowned and felt annoyed in her heart. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t get it, but you are not good enough for Xiao Yi. All I want today is for you to promise never to bother Xiao Yi again so as not to invite trouble!\u201d\u201cHaha!\u201d Jun Mo Xie laughed out once before narrowing his eyes and ask, \u201cIsn\u2019t your royal princess stepping out of line? Are you her mother?!\u201dThen with an \u201cOh\u201d sound, his face lit up as if in sudden realization before a strange smile emerged. \u201cSo you were jealous! Wahaha!\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Princess Ling Ming\u2019s delicate frame suddenly trembled in anger, and her lips were quivering uncontrollably. Jun Mo Xie\u2019s words were simply a malicious mockery to an unmarried woman, not to mention that the person involved was a royal princess!\u201cWoman, let\u2019s first make things clear! Just exactly who is harassing who? Understand? Fuck. Wait until you have properly investigated the truth before you start mouthing off, understand? A princess of a kingdom does not even understand such simple logic! No wonder other people say you only have big boobs but have no brain, even though your chest is small!\u201dJun Mo Xie extended his hands out and began fondling the air with an evil grin. He gave a little sigh and said, \u201cUnexpectedly same as poached egg and also being brainless? What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201dJun Mo Xie couldn\u2019t care less about her identity as a princess. What royalty? In his heart, there is no difference between a princess and a daughter of a notable family, not to mention that Princess Ling Ming\u2019s demands have already aroused his enmity!Avoiding that little girl is one thing, but ordering him to avoid that little girl is another. He opposed the royal princess as a matter of principle. This was also a sore subject for Young Master Jun to begin with so he wasn\u2019t in a good mood at the moment. If it were not for his apprehension about those assassins leaving, he would have long taken down Princess Ling Ming!Do the way I, your father, handle business need the input of a little girl like you? Whatever I do, I will never be soft hearted towards women!Princess Ling Ming exhaled deeply and glared at him with two bone-chilling eyes. \u201cJun Mo Xie, If you remain so stubborn, do not blame me when I inform this matter to Great General Dugu Wu Di. You should know better than me what will happen at that time. Even Grandpa Jun may not be able to protect you. It will not be pretty for anyone!\u201d\u201cYou are scaring me! I\u2019m so afraid!\u201d Jun Mo Xie\u2019s face showed fear as his voice trembled, patting his chest in very exaggerated movements. \u201cMy heart is about to jump out of my chest\u2026\u201dHis expression suddenly changed as he urged, \u201cYou should quickly go and tell him. Leave quickly now. When the evening arrives, hehe, you know a man will have urges in that particular region of his body. This master is not a lady like you who must act with propriety. You should hurry up and go. I have to thank your royal princess! Haha!\u201dJun Mo Xie did not try to hold back his words. Thinking to himself, I, your father, request that you leave quickly. It will be for the best if this leads to Dugu Xiao Yi being grounded indefinitely by her father. If that were to happen, then I\u2019d really need to thank you.\u201cGood! Very Good! Jun Mo Xie! Words are like the wind, so you better not regret when the time comes!\u201d Princess Ling Ming\u2019s tender figure trembled with anger, and her charming face paled. She had her heart in the right place when she gave her warning; first in consideration for Dugu Xiao Yi, which incidentally also benefited Jun Mo Xie. In case this actually causes an incident, the Dugu Family really will not fear Jun Zhan Tian. If Jun Mo Xie really did something unforgivable, a situation where Dugu Wu Di will apprehend and execute Jun Mo Xie could actually happen.If she means to go through with this, then the Jun Family and Dugu Family will inevitably become mortal enemies. And with two big military clans at war with one another, the whole Tianxiang Kingdom will become scattered ashes and dispersed smoke.The two would not be agreeable and parted on bad terms. As if it was planned, both individuals held the same sneer on their faces. Jun Mo Xie turned his head away to the side and muttered to himself.\u201cI really ate my fill to the point of bursting. Why are there so many brain dead people everywhere? She\u2019s not even my wife, and she wants to control who I date? What gives her the right to stick her nose into other people\u2019s business!?\u201dPrincess Ling Ming\u2019s lungs were about to burst with rage, her two beautiful eyes in a death glare, and her chest violently heaved up and down. He almost made her vomit blood. Not saying another word, she turned around and left. Walking away, she ferociously stamped her little feet making thumping sounds, seemingly wanting to tear into the ground beneath her feet. If she stays here any longer, only God knows if she will go insane with her anger!It was truly difficult to understand why Dugo Xiao Yi\u2019s heart is unexpectedly moved by this kind of despicable, shameless, vile, filthy, lowly and reprobate person?!The pale-faced Ye Gu Han arrived in front of Jun Mo Xie and coldly said. \u201cYou\u2019re still the same trash. I usually disdain using force, but you are too abominable; today, I will act on behalf of Grandpa Jun and teach you a lesson! I\u2019ll make you understand there are people you cannot afford to offend!\u201d He had overheard their conversation earlier and had already been at his limits. It could already be considered an extraordinary accomplishment to be able to endure until now.Ju Mo Xie curled his lips and sneered. \u201cPah! Who the hell are you? You open your mouth and somehow can represent one of the foremost officials, the Grand Duke of the Kingdom? Truly too ridiculous!\u201dHis heart filled with disdain. Jun Mo Xie already regarded people who talk big before fighting as the definition of an idiot! And considering the fact that there are still killers on the loose, this became even more inexcusable!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBoth of Ye Gu Han\u2019s eyes instantly shot open as an azure blue radiance issue forth.

Sky Xuan expert Ye Gu Han is bullying someone! Come quickly, come and see a Sky Xuan expert beating up a person who is so weak he can\u2019t even truss up a chicken. Help!\u201d Ye Gu Han\u2019s palm hasn\u2019t even moved when Jun Mo Xie already shouted out extremely sharp words in a loud and clear voice. He did not want to lose. As the saying goes, a wise man knows better than to fight when the odds are against him.Ye Gu Han\u2019s deathly pale complexion that hasn\u2019t changed in ten years instantly flushed a deep shade of red.Too shameless! Truly too shameless! For a person to be so shameless to this extent, it really makes one\u2019s hair stand up in anger!\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Ye Gu Han\u2019s raised hand trembled as he pointed at Jun Mo Xie in anger. This Sky Xuan expert simply cannot imagine this situation!

Ignore him. Let\u2019s go.\u201dYe Gu Han was so infuriated that he almost struck that brat right then and there. Instead, he disappeared in front of Jun Mo Xie\u2019s eyes with a 'swish\u201d. As he left, he thought in his heart:\u00a0\u00a0Although this brat\u2019s Xuan Qi is garbage and his martial arts mediocre, his mouth is truly the most vicious one in the world. I hope I don\u2019t encounter him again. If I do, he might actually anger me to death. I would definitely go down in the books of Xuan Xuan Continent as the first Sky Xuan expert to be angered to death!During that short period of time, he did not even fight, much less get injured. However, his blood still somehow rolled and he even had the urge to vomit blood! He had never experienced something like this before.\u00a0Even the backlash from his meridians when his martial arts cultivation went astray hadn\u2019t been this grave.\u201cI, your father, will die if I don\u2019t anger you to death! But I still have to thank you for solving my troubles.\u201dJun Mo Xie snorted and watched as Princess Ling Ming and Ye Gu Han left while having smoke pouring out of their seven orifices. After checking both ends of the empty street, he gave a sly smile and pushed off with his left foot, leaping up on top of the walls with a 'swish\u201d and disappearing with the blink of an eye.Princess Ling Ming climbed straight onto the sedan chair. Her whole body was still trembling from head to toe, her sight shrouded in darkness, her mouth panting vehemently and her heart feeling like exploding out of her chest.The maids to her side were frightened out of their minds, continuously patting the princess\u2019 chest and massaging her back in an attempt to relieve her anger. The maids took a long time to calm her down, only to feel weak as if they had just come back from waging war.This is the first time in my life that I had been angered to such an extent, so much so that I have a sudden to urge to see Jun Mo Xie\u2019s body dismembered into thousands of pieces!\u201cHead to the Dugu Residence!\u201d Princess Ling Ming ordered.Ye Gu Han\u2019s face became black, then white, then red, before changing back to black.\u00a0It was like putting on a face changing performance, but the only regret was that there were only three colours of red, black, and white colour. If there were a few more colours, then he would have been worthy of being a face changing grandmaster! The rage rising in his body gave him an impulse to destroy everything. Both eyes looked straight ahead like an erupting volcano.The eight Jun Family bodyguards were sweating profusely as they watched him, their hearts filled with anxiety. How has the princess and this person have already returned yet our family\u2019s young master still has not come yet? Did our young master not shout out just now? This person wouldn\u2019t have beaten our young master to tears right?!Even though Ye Gu Han\u2019s fury was palpable and the bodyguards were aware that this was a dangerous time to provoke him, their sense of responsibility to protect the young master still prevailed in the end. Finally plucking up the courage, one of the guards opened his mouth and asked. \u201cThis distinguished lord\u2026do you know my family\u2019s young master\u2026..\u201d\u201cGet lost!\u201d Both of Ye Gu Han\u2019s eyes became blood red. His long, grey hair rose up as if to pierce the sky. His furious bellow was drawn-out and full of power, causing the heavens and earth to quake. The colour drained from everyone\u2019s faces, their heart wildly beating as they were shaken to the point of almost falling over.This was the absolute strength of a peak Sky Xuan expert!All the pent-up anger in his heart finally poured out like torrential rain! He was afraid that had he not have vented out his anger just now, he might have already suffered some internal injuries!A single shout rocked the entire city!Countless experts in the capital instantly became alert as they soared up into the sky to hover over the capital. Everyone was curious. An expert that could be able to issue such an imposing voice would at the very least be a peak Earth Xuan expert! What could have caused this expert to become so infuriated? Everyone could tell from the voice that he was willing to burn heaven and earth due to his fury!By a small tavern doorway, Old Song suddenly widened his turbid old eyes in surprise. How is it that I can hear little Ye\u2019s voice? Watching as Ye Gu Han and Princess Ling Ming\u2019s sedan chair leave, the Jun Family bodyguards rushed into the alley to find it empty; with a single look, they could not even see a shadow of their young master. The guards couldn\u2019t help but cry out!The young master has not only been killed by this strange guard but even had his body been completely destroyed?!Jun Mo Xie appeared from the hidden depths of the shadows, rushing through the alley, his spiritual senses already spread out so as to closely match the swift speed of the black-clothed assassins.Jun Xie\u2019s hands ceaselessly moved and, before he had even advanced one zhang, his face completely transformed into that of another person, resembling a man in his mid-thirties, his hair slightly dishevelled. This ordinary appearance could be found everywhere in the capital and would be difficult to identify this person in a crowd.Jun Xie flew out onto the main street after several twists and turns, his feet under him seemed to be as if they were moving in slow motion but in actuality was moving quite fast. After passing through a clothing store, his speed had not slowed down in the slightest but his moon white gown had changed into navy blue commoner outfit. The owner of the shop was now unconscious, still sporting the same grin to welcome customers\u2026The assassins ahead were obviously very cautious. After changing directions and taking multiple detours, each and every one had already changed their appearances to that of ordinary merchants and peddlers. They were neither fast nor slow as they travelled eastward, talking while walking, occasionally letting outfits of laughter as if sharing a very enjoyable conversation. Vulgar expressions were seen on their three faces, appearing to other people as if they were having perverse thoughts about women, like a stereotypical patron of brothels.This assassin group\u2019s level was not simple. Jun Xie sighed in his heart. It is true that in his previous life, such disguises were commonly used by assassins. But now there were three people in this world who are able to do so naturally, so it\u2019s clear as day that the training they had was quite well-established. What was even more impressive was the three of them had already hidden away their killing intent such that not a single bit was leaking out. This is the true place with talents.If not for his spiritual sense being able to detect the cold yin aura from the other party, they would almost certainly be impossible to track.In other words, there was no one else that was able to use such a tracking method apart from him!It was after chasing his target for a long time that faint sounds of water were soon heard from up ahead, accompanied by the melodious sounds of a string instrument and the voices of women singing. After the fragrance of a woman\u2019s cosmetic had become more and more concentrated, the assassins\u2019 destination became readily apparent.Spirit Fog Lake!Jun Mo Xie finally understood why these people had to pass through that particular street; it was the only road that leads directly to the Spirit Fog Lake. Any other route would inevitably lead to a long detour around the lake! But if he wants to change his appearance, then he would rather take this detour several more times. He will almost certainly not be caught!And along the way, Jun Mo Xie already changed his clothes three times and even transformed his height and body type three times!Tianxiang City\u2019s Spirit Fog Lake was known as heaven for all men. There are heavenly beauties here of all shapes and sizes. As long as you can imagine it, you will certainly find it here! Patrons could wantonly enter one of the many pavilions or step foot on a merrily-decorated pleasure boat. Whatever you can think of you can try. Whatever you desire you can do. As long as you have enough money, you can do as you please without any worries!But if you don\u2019t have money, then\u2026you\u2019d better just scram. Even old and even older escorts as fat as Tang Yuan will not spare you a look!This world naturally has their fair share of fairy tales, gifted scholars and beautiful maidens, escorts falling in love, vows of marriage without parents\u2019 approval, how love will find a way, and so on. But a fairy tale, after all, will only be a fairy tale!Fairy tales always have happy endings, but unfortunately, life can be very cruel. Many poor and vain scholars, who thought themselves as handsome and talented, had put on a distinguished intellectual appearance to come here in an attempt to create their own fairy tale. They had anticipated that a divine beauty would fall in love at first sight, and how their charms and talents would allow them to live on the earnings of these escorts\u2026Unfortunately, they had all been heartlessly thrown out in after only being able to fish out a pittance of copper coins from their pockets. Some were even thrown into the Spirit Fog Lake and were drowned half to death. Their fate reminded them that fairy tales were certainly appealing, but without enough money in their pocket, your life would be thrown away like a ragdoll and die in a stupid, meaningless and shameful manner\u2026Think about what kind of place a local brothel is? Prostitutes don\u2019t talk about love and courtesans only talk of nonsense! And a brothel is a place that is filled with the former! What man would visit this kind of establishment and agree to remain chaste if his wife is not in the room? Pretending to have pure intentions at a brothel is like giving prostitutes a certificate of chastity. How detestable and patronizing!For the women who were accustomed to seeing the very worst in people, how could they not be able to see through the half-assed scholarly and cultured pretences for what they really are?There are very few good men like those in fairy tales!No wonder Tang Yuan once said that bastards were cleanly killed with one sword stroke, but hypocrites were continuously tormented and tortured until they collapsed from a mental breakdown.He always kept these words close to heart!Jun Mo Xie concealed himself among the shadows, sticking to the walls and hiding behind trees. His body seems as though it possessed an almost intangible and elusive quality and was able to become one with anything he used as cover. Not one passerby along the way noticed his presence, not to mention the three assassins he was following.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBut if one was looking at the three men in front, all they would see was companionship dominating their thoughts, but they kept up a perfect gentleman\u2019s appearance. This nouveau riche entered a luxurious building in the outer reaches of Spirit Fog Lake\u2014Ni Chang Pavilion.After the party went in, a nearby pleasure boat begins to slowly row over before coming to a stop in the waters near the Ni Chang Pavilion.Jun Mo Xie was stunned by what he saw. Apart from the helmsman outside, there was surprisingly no one else on the boat. It seemed as if it\u2019s just waiting for him. This situation seemed a little odd. What\u2019s more, the people that have since gone onboard have stayed on the other side of the boat? Isn\u2019t this too good to be true? Jun Mo Xie gritted his teeth. Let\u2019s take a gamble!A sudden gust of wind rose up. Amidst a clump of reed, a piece broke loose before gently drifting away on the surface of the lake. A hint of dream-like quality accompanied the arrival of the setting sun, forming an uncanny scenery.Jun Mo Xie planned to exploit these drifting reeds. His entire body seems to merge effortlessly into the clumps of reeds by the side of the lake and soon came within a dozen zhangs of the boat. Hidden behind a thick willow on shore, he broke off two pieces of reeds to hold in his hands and slipped soundlessly into the water.\u00a0His movement in the water was as light as a feather such that he did not even cause even the slightest of ripples. Actually, he had only recently achieved this level of movement after vigorously training. If it were a fortnight before, he would definitely have not been able to move in this way.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After reorienting himself, he proceeded to slowly walk towards the pleasure boat. It was not long before the water had turned pitch black, indicating that he had already arrived underneath the boat.Jun Mo Xie silently floated up before reaching out with one hand to tightly hold on to the hull. The reed held in his other hand was placed in his mouth and, with a sharp exhalation, the long piece of reed quietly extended out of the water by the side of the boat. A breath of fresh air filled Jun Mo Xie\u2019s nearly asphyxiated lungs and his body naturally relaxed.A single careless mistake in this series of manoeuvres and all his efforts would have gone to waste. His targets would certainly notice his presence and even try to kill him, leading to a fatal disaster!Jun Mo Xie took no further actions and only waited motionlessly without showing any signs of impatience. His previous anxiety and misgivings have all but disappeared. He no longer worried in his heart whether the assassins will board the boat. Since he had already selected his targets, there will be no room for regret!Intuition! He held a firm belief that the assassins will come on this boat!Therefore, he was endlessly patient. As long as he can breathe, he will wait. It was just like in his previous life when he had to rely on his intuition to pursue murderers or hide from his enemies. At this moment, he is the King of Assassins, Jun Xie!After some time passed, there finally came the sound of a young lady\u2019s delicate laugh and the echoes of boorish men talking and laughing. As people embarked, the boat swayed, and the thudding of footsteps could be heard coming from above Jun Mo Xie.One, two\u2026six individuals!Jun Mo Xie counted in silence. It seemed that three more people had joined the party of assassins that have arrived earlier.Once the party had boarded the boat, their distinctive cold aura suddenly caused a reaction in Jun Mo Xie\u2019s mind. In this ice-cold water, the cold killing intent made Jun Mo Xie feel a sense of familiarity.This is my world!The extravagant life of a noble\u2014the glory, splendor, and wealth\u2014admittedly was very comfortable, but Jun Mo Xie was the King of Assassins. He yearned to be unfettered like the king of wolves, arrogantly howling among a vast expanse of rolling grassland. Even if danger lurks around every corner, he will still choose to be a king, looking down upon the world!Suffering leads to growth; the solitary enjoys the loneliness. A solitary shadow charging into the unknown, brandishing his sword in defiance of the heavens. Ten steps to kill a person, a thousand miles without leaving a trace!This is Jun Mo Xie\u2019s grandest dream.Unfortunately, it is uncertain whether Jun Mo Xie will have such an opportunity in his current body.No one spoke after entering the boat\u2019s cabin. Only the sounds of teacups softly touching followed by the 'sipping and slurping\u201d of tea and the occasional gentle laughter of a young lady could be heard.It was only after some time had passed when a hoarse voice spoke up. \u201cLady Yue\u2019er, do you know when Lord Liu will arrive? My brothers have been waiting here and we\u2019ll get nowhere like this. The assassination attempt on the Princess is a serious criminal charge! There is still an ongoing manhunt in the city! That incident hasn\u2019t even died down yet but we are still tasked with safekeeping these priceless Xuan beast tendons. If by any chance something was to happen\u2026this one\u2026\u201dA girl\u2019s delicate laugh was heard before she voiced out unperturbed. \u201cHall Master Zhao, is there such cause for alarm? This is the Ni Chang Pavilion. Don\u2019t tell me that you are unaware of what kind of place this Ni Chang Pavilion is?\u201cThere will naturally not be any mishaps here at Ni Chang Pavilion, but we can never be too careful! The failed assassination attempt has already put us on edge and have us backed against a wall. With the many delays and the Xuan beast tendons still in our possession, it would not be wise to stay any longer in Tianxiang!\u201d The one surnamed Zhao was feeling somewhat embarrassed but replied nonetheless.\u201cSo Hall Master Zhao is only thinking of washing his hands of this problematic situation. Perhaps the reason isn\u2019t just some manhunt! What do you have to say about your failure? Don\u2019t tell me that Hall Master plans on shifting the responsibility at this point?!\u2026\u201d The young lady chided derisively. Hall Master Zhao only gave a snort and did not open his mouth to retort.However, one of his men spat in contempt. \u201cLady Yue\u2019er, your words are too unfair. Surely we are not the only ones at fault for the previous mission\u2019s failure. If the intelligence you provided had not been wrong, would we have returned having failed so dramatically? If we had known earlier that a Sky Xuan expert accompanied the princess, would our organization have planned the assassination like so? The difficulty of this mission had clearly not been a trifling grade 3! It was an impossible task to challenge a Sky Xuan expert with the strength of the members we have previously dispatched. We demand that \u2018Second Uncle\u2019 provide our Hall Master with an acceptable explanation for the losses we have suffered.The young lady was silent for a moment and then slowly replied. \u201cYou received the money. Our side requested you to kill a princess with the strength of Silver Xuan, did we not? And we had spent a considerable amount of resources to arrange for the majority of the men by the princess\u2019 side to be away at that time. It could even be said that we have created the ideal scenario for you. If that is still not enough for you to succeed, then it is obviously you that is incompetent. As for this \u2018Sky Xuan expert\u2019\u2026hehe, whether or not this person really appeared, is your problem. We paid you for results and not excuses.\u201dAfter a brief pause, the sound of the young lady standing up could clearly be heard. Slowly pacing back and forth, a low but clear voice said. \u201cI am but an insignificant young lady. Speaking to me regarding this business is not worth your time. Don\u2019t be impatient. When Lord Liu arrives, you will have plenty of opportunities to speak to him yourself.\u201d She sat down on a chair before picking up a cup of tea. For a moment, an incomparably awkward atmosphere filled the cabin.The assassins were extremely angry after hearing the young lady\u2019s sophistry. In the time that one of the assassins was about to flare up, the bow of the pleasure boat swayed slightly as two individuals made their way onboard.The atmosphere in the cabin had shifted once again with the appearance of these two persons. Presumably, one of the new arrivals has a significant background and is certain to be a peak level expert.Jun Mo Xie could sense his surrounding gradually dim\u2014the onset of night. On both shores of the Spirit Fog Lake, all kinds of lanterns shone upon the water surface, a plethora of colors spread out, as if a scene from a dream.\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d A profound and imposing voice asked after having felt the strange atmosphere in the cabin. The penetrating manner of speaking revealed an eminent status and a regal kind of bearing.\u201cLord Liu, our Blood Sword Hall demand that you provide us with an explanation for the business regarding the previous assassination attempt.\u201d The hoarse-voiced assassin leader continued without reservation. \u201cWhy were we not informed that a Sky Xuan expert was escorting and protecting Princess Ling Ming? Our forces were caught unaware and have been entirely wiped out. The losses we have suffered this time are unprecedented for my Blood Sword Hall!\u201d\u201cOh? So according to Hall Master Zhao, not only was the assassination mission was not successful but also, the fault lies with us instead?\u201d Lord Liu said unflustered and seemingly with a smile. \u201cThen with the Blood Sword Hall\u2019s reputation, I\u2019m sure we can negotiate a lower payment for your lack of results.\u201dThe assassin leader\u2019s hoarse voice replied. \u201cLord Liu, you are an expert. How does this business have anything to do with the Blood Sword Hall\u2019s reputation? Once our Blood Sword Hall accepted payment, regardless of whom, we have always killed without mistakes! But the missions have always been conducted under the assumption that the employer provided accurate information to determine the degree of difficulty and then dispatch the appropriate task force to ensure a kill with a single strike!\u201dWhile he was speaking with such intense vehemence, Jun Mo Xie was actually down below almost despising him to death! An assassin, and not just any, one who is leading a veteran assassin organization, blindly believes in their employer\u2019s information? Truly ridiculous! Even if the employer\u2019s information was accurate, the assassin organization and the assassins themselves need to scrutinize the details! To blindly trust your employer is to gamble with your own lives!The man continued to speak. \u201cWhether you were purposefully concealing or had overlooked this crucial piece of information, the fact remains that a Sky Xuan expert had been present! If our Grandmaster knew beforehand about the Sky Xuan expert\u2019s participation, he would not have only sent two Gold Xuan level assassins! Perhaps our Grandmaster would have personally undertaken this mission! The reason the mission was not completed was due to the fact that your information was unsatisfactory\u2014how can the blame be on put on my Blood Sword Hall? Not to mention that this assassination absolutely was not just a grade 3 mission!\u201dAlthough his tone was rather blunt and disrespectful, Lord Liu inexplicably was not angered. Instead, he muttered to himself irresolutely for a while before asking.\u201cAre you certain? That person\u2026was actually a Sky Xuan expert?\u201d\u201cI am absolutely certain!\u201dThe assassin leader nodded his head with extreme vigor.\u201cThe Sky Xuan expert\u2019s flying daggers were dark blue in color so his level of cultivation must have reached a peak level. What\u2019s more, the control he displayed was as light as a feather as if he hadn\u2019t used any power, indicating that his intention was deterrence! This level of control is already nearing the legendary skills of the Spirit Xuan level existence! I dare to guarantee that although this expert is still in the Sky Xuan Realm, he is but one step away from the doorsteps of the legendary Spirit Xuan Realm!\u201dThe more the assassin leader spoke, the more fortunate he felt that he had not personally participated in the operation this time. Otherwise, he may very well already been buried six feet underground! At this point, he felt confident that he had actually been tiptoeing around the gates of hell. His heart has already grown suspicious of this \u201cLord Liu\u201d sitting in front of him as his eyes slightly narrowed. You did not intentionally deceive us so that we\u2019ll throw our lives away, right?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cSky Xuan\u2026Sky Xuan peak level expert\u2026\u201d Lord Liu paced back and forth, creased his brows and thought to himself. \u201cWhen did such a person appear in the capital? Why are they\u2026so unconventional? Too abnormal!\u201d\u201cLord Liu? How should we proceed with this matter!\u201d The black-clothed assassin had waited for a long time without speaking but finally had to ask.\u201cYes? Oh, well\u2026since you are sure about this matter, then this must be reported back to \u2018Second Uncle\u2019.\u201d Lord Liu muttered. \u201cTo have the protection of a Sky Xuan expert, ordinary assassination methods will be ineffective\u2026\u201d He raised his head to glance at the three men in front of him. Even though he did not speak, the implication was clear that they were no longer adequate.\u201cWhat Lord Liu said is not wrong; we are also aware. With this Sky Xuan level expert present, just the few of us aren\u2019t enough to assassinate the princess.\u201d The assassin leader said, holding back his anger with great difficulty. \u201cBut people that cannot even produce accurate information don\u2019t appear to be very useful either?!\u201d\u201cOh? Hahaha\u2026,\u201d Lord Liu trembled in anger but immediately broke out into laughter before changing the topic of discussion. \u201cBut you did not even manage to kill a single Jun Mo Xie, such an opportunity is gone forever, what a great pity!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
