For Philomel, the scaffold was the seat of the day and the last place to be.A large crowd gathered at the execution site to see the last of the wicked woman. Philomel screamed at them, saying she didn\u2019t want to die, but that was soon silenced by the merciless kicks of the guards who grabbed her by the arms.Emperor Eustis gazed indifferently at the being who had once been his daughter from his highest seat, and next to him, Princess Ellencia, with a pale complexion, clung tightly to her father.\u201cListen to the treacherous!\u201dThe person presiding over her execution stood before her and began reciting Philomel\u2019s crimes one by one. The crime of impersonating the princess for ten years in collusion with her mother. The crime of envying and slandering the princess even though she saved her life through her mercy. The crime of trying to cause a national crisis by alienating the relationship between the Mage Tower and the Empire. In addition, several minor crimes were listed one by one.\u201cTherefore, she deserves the death penalty!\u201dAlmost as soon as the ruler finished speaking, harsh shouts and swearing erupted from all sides.\u201cQuickly kill her!\u201d\u201cHow dare you pretend to be a princess despite your low bloodline!\u201d\u201cThey should have executed you along with your mother!\u201dEggs and stones thrown by the angry mob mercilessly hit Philomel.After a long time, the ruler raised his hand to restrain the angry people.\u201cIt was originally a right not granted to a sinner like you, but the merciful Princess Elencia gave you the opportunity to leave a will with grace. Do you have any last words?\u201d\u201cMe?\u201dThen Philomel\u2019s yellow eyes, which had been staring down without life, turned to the emperor.\u201c\u2026Ah, Father.\u201dThe Emperor\u2019s eyebrows rose slightly at the sound of his voice.\u201cI did not impersonate the princess. In the meantime, I will not beg you to save me, just as if I were your daughter. If only you knew that one thing\u2026\u201dConfined to a solitary cell with no sunlight, she thought about it all the time. Countless people\u2019s heads fell just because they were even a little close to her, or because they showed sympathy for her devastated face. Then all the lingering feelings that had been holding her back until now felt useless. Why did she struggle so hard to be loved and did not want for anything to be taken away from her? Neither affection nor place belonged to her anyway.But, just one thing.It was unfair that the first and greatest sin among the line of crimes was not true. Other people may not know but she only wanted one person to know my innocence.Her father. Emperor Eustis of the Belerov Empire.The one who didn\u2019t even show the slightest interest in her, even after ten or so years of knowing Philomel as her own daughter. She was the one who wanted to be loved and know that he was her only family though. Now that she had come too far, she couldn\u2019t relieve his hatred, but she hoped that at least the truth would be known.From the start, she said she had no intention of cheating on him. He said he knew that she wasn\u2019t his real daughter until Elencia appeared. When you think about it, it was a very natural story. It was around the time they were just born that Philomel\u2019s birth mother switched her daughter and the princess. After that, Philomel continued to live in the imperial palace as a princess, and Elencia lived as a commoner with her birth mother, so she never had a chance to meet her. But when did she meet her birth mother and conspire, and how did she deceive everyone?Anyone could guess this simple fact, but everyone treated Philomel as an impostor. It was because of the notoriety that Philomel had accumulated. Still, she held out her hopes. Even if others didn\u2019t believe her, a rational and wise emperor might discover the truth.Of course, it was a vain hope.\u201cEnough. Get the thread right now and sew its mouth.\u201dThe emperor\u2019s order was like pouring cold water in her heart, she stopped but the turmoil was revived.\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d\u201cDo as His Majesty commands!\u201d\u201cSew it! Sew!\u201dThe attendants scrambled to find a thread enough to sew the sinner\u2019s mouth, and Elensia\u2019s expression worsened even more. Holding her father\u2019s sleeve and talking to him, Elencia, who had beautiful blonde hair, unlike Philomel\u2019s usual brown hair. She was the beloved daughter of the emperor, who resembles the deceased empress.Philomel\u2019s eyes were wet with despair.\u2018What did I expect?\u2019She knew for sure it would turn out like that. It must have been because of the long torture.\u2018Let\u2019s just quietly accept death.\u2019That\u2019s the only way to keep her ego alive. Yes. No matter what anyone said, she was once the princess of the Belerov Empire.\u2018That\u2019s the only thing\u2026 my only pride.\u2019\u201cYour Majesty!\u201dIt was clearly meant to be, but Philomel stood up without realizing it and called for the emperor. A strangely loud sound came out even though I had lived on bread crumbs for days and days.As Eustis\u2019 grim gaze met her, unexpected words spilled out of her mouth. Her tears also wet her cheeks incessantly.\u201cHave I, have I ever been your daughter? Have I ever been a little bit like your daughter?\u201dIn the meantime,she\u00a0 kept asking him.She wanted to.Not since Elencia appeared, even when she thought she was his real daughter. Why did he always look at her with such cold eyes? She was his child, right? Even if he couldn\u2019t love her, couldn\u2019t he treat her as a child?Fearing the answer that would come back, she hadn\u2019t bothered to ask. However, in the face of her death, a strange courage sprang up.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cDad, stop it\u2026\u201dThe emperor, who was about to answer, looked away when her daughter whined.For the kind-hearted Elencia it was hard to see Philomel\u2019s execution, no matter how much she tried to harm her.The emperor affectionately embraced the shoulder of his lovely daughter who begged him to leave that place quickly, instructed them to proceed with the execution, and then left the execution ground. Philomel was left behind, cleanly ignored.\u201c\u2026You can just give me an answer and go.\u201dPhilomel spat out her last will. Just like that, Philomel, a rare villain, died without anyone sympathizing with her. Fortunately, her mouth was not stitched up because the emperor was quick to take care of it. It was the last good fortune given to the wicked.Although she died a long and painful death not by the guillotine, but by the executioner\u2019s blunt blade, because they could not give her an easy death.Her only innocence was overshadowed by so many evil deeds that she was buried without ever seeing the light of day. Indeed, she was fit for a villain\u2026\u201cKiaaaaaagh!\u201dShe screamed and Philomel tossed the book she was reading.\u201cWhat is this! Why am I the Philomel in the book?\u201dEven if the girl stomped her feet with her little body and pounded her chest, it didn\u2019t change the contents of her book.The nine-year-old princess regretted looking at the suspicious books she picked up in the garden.At some point, she wondered if someone had written a novel about the background of the real imperial family. From the very beginning, they put forward an unheard of commoner woman and said that she was the emperor\u2019s own daughter, and that this Philomel was fake.\u201cI\u2019m going to tell my father right away and I won\u2019t let the guy who wrote this go.\u201dIt was a book that had a lot of potential for blaspheming the imperial family. How dare anybody fake the sole heir of the Belerov Empire! That was not enough, and she was beaten in the cruel end. If the author hadn\u2019t killed her, she would have given him a life sentence, but if it wasn\u2019t the death penalty, her anger wouldn\u2019t be resolved.\u201cPhew.\u201dActing like she was about to run out at any moment, Philomel sat down on the floor where her power rug was bare. If her nanny saw it, she\u2019d nag her for ungodly behavior, but it didn\u2019t matter, since she was alone after her probation.In the first place, the reason she read this absurd and insulting novel, <Princess Elencia> almost to the end was because she was filthy bored. Twice a day she had to be confined to her room except for a walk in the garden. She didn\u2019t know if she would be able to meet her father even if her probation was lifted. Eustis was an indifferent father who had no interest in her daughter at all. There were very few times when he talked to her face to face.The times they had tea or a meal together could be counted with a hand, and they were always silent. When Philomel visited him randomly, she was regarded as a nuisance and she was kicked out of the room.The reason she was put on probation yesterday was because Philomel burst into the emperor\u2019s office and made a noise because she was so upset that she wouldn\u2019t meet him.\u201cPut that away right now.\u201dSeeing her daughter crying, asking why he didn\u2019t come to see her, the emperor ordered his attendants with his extremely cold face.In the end, Philomel had no choice but to be dragged back to her room. As the emperor\u2019s cold attitude continued for nearly a decade, others began to look down on the princess. Rumors that the emperor\u2019s nephew, rather than Philomel, would inherit the throne after the emperor further fueled their arrogance.The emperor, who loved her beautiful empress dearly, resented his daughter for her birth that caused her mother\u2019s death. Everybody knew that. Moreover, the princess didn\u2019t resemble her mother at all, and since she didn\u2019t stand out anywhere and only caused trouble, it\u2019s natural that he didn\u2019t care.Drooping, Philomele staggered toward the mirror hanging on the wall.\u201cDoesn\u2019t it look like that?\u201dIn the mirror, Philomel was impeccably sharp, with her brown hair and yellow eyes. She was lingeringly young, but she didn\u2019t resemble her mother, whom she only saw in portraits, nor her father. The emperor has black hair, and the empress has blonde hair and green eyes. Even if she simply compared the color of them, it did not work. When Philomel was young, the color of her hair looked like a merge. She prayed every night that her hair would become a bit lighter and golden, but as she grew up, it became a rather dark brown color.Well, even if her hair color resembles her grandmother\u2019s grandmother, where did the bright yellow eyes come from?The girl felt depressed because she didn\u2019t really feel like her parents\u2019 real child.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Just the name was the same. The name \u2018Philomel\u2019 was not common, but it was not rare either. However, Philomel was a little uncomfortable because he had repeatedly felt that the \u2018Pilomel\u2019 in the novel was similar to herself.For example, there was an anecdote from her childhood that was narrated to reveal the evil nature of \u2018Philomel\u2019.\u2018Philomel\u2019 lost the necklace her father gave her as a birthday present. Fearing to be hated by him, she tried to kill one of her maids for stealing it. In fact, there was a similar incident. But it wasn\u2019t intentionally blaming her maid for her sins. Philomel really thought her maid had taken it. Her necklace was missing, which she misunderstood as it was the maid who last cleaned her room. Later, when her maid\u2019s innocence was revealed, she was scolded by her nanny and even apologized to her properly. She didn\u2019t even mean to kill her. Tracing her memory, she thought \u2018I\u2019m going to kill you!\u2019 but it was purely out of anger.It wasn\u2019t a lie at all, but in the novel, \u2018Philomel\u201ds inner thoughts or back story were not revealed, so she looked like a complete villainess.\u201cNo. It must have just been written on its own accord, based on what an unknown outsider had heard about it.\u201dShaking her head, Philomel muttered as if to reassure herself.\u201cPrincess, I\u2019m going in.\u201dSuddenly, the voice of the nanny came from outside the door.\u201cHey, wait a minute!\u201dShe hurried to the desk and put the novel into a drawer. It was clear that she would be hit with a nagging bomb if she was found out reading a romance novel while she was on probation.\u201cYou weren\u2019t studying and you were doing something else, right?\u201dShe didn\u2019t even get permission to come in, but the nanny opened the door and entered, frowning and looking around.\u201cWhat the hell! I was studying properly.\u201dShe pointed to the thick history books on her desk, but the suspicious nanny looked around her room a few more times before standing in front of Philomel.\u201cPlease grow up a bit now. If the princess gets into trouble, we, who serve her, will be in trouble.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dSoon, the nanny\u2019s nagging started. Her nanny was the only one who could treat her badly, except for the emperor. She was also the empress\u2019s nanny, and everyone referred to her as her nanny, even though she never gave milk to Philomel. It is said that the empress trusted and relied on her nanny, almost like her own mother, and brought her into the palace when she got married.Eustis respected her wife\u2019s will and made the nanny her daughter\u2019s nanny, leaving full responsibility for her upbringing and education. As he was indifferent to her daughter, in fact rhe affairs with Philomel were left to her nanny alone.\u201cHis Majesty has firmly instructed her to correct the princess\u2019s habits this time.\u201d\u201cChi. Lies.\u201dApart from saying that, Eustis was not a father who was interested in her daughter to this extent. However, the nanny knew that it worked well for her Philomel, and she used to sell the name of Eustis to try to control the princess.She said, for example, that if she took a good etiquette class, she would let Eustis share her meal, or if she got a perfect score on her test, she would let her go to her office. Even so, when Philomel fulfilled the condition, she avoided the fulfillment of her promise, making excuses for each other. It was only after the nanny broke dozens of promises that Philomel realized she had been tricked. Her nanny blamed her for losing interest in her successor\u2019s classes.\u201cWhat did you say now? What a lie! It\u2019s a bad habit to start doubting what people say. Do I really have to listen to the rod of love?\u201dWhen her true feelings were revealed, the nanny made an exaggerated fuss. She said, \u201cOkay. Be careful in the future, okay, I\u2019ll do it.\u201dPhilomel lowered her tail first. The nanny, though near her old age, was of good form and strong. She didn\u2019t severely punish the princess even with a hawk, but it was terrifying enough for the little child.\u201cPlease, please. I really want to know who she resembles. Lady Isabella was kind and\u2026\u201dEven at her age she had been hammered by her nanny, because she was not like her mother, those words pierced her heart.\u201cNanny\u2026\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cUh?\u201dShe didn\u2019t look so much like her mother, Philomel asked cautiously about her.\u201cYeah. It\u2019s amazing. Lady Isabella was smart since she was young, mature, and at the same time innocent at times.\u201dUndermining Mel\u2019s self-esteem was her nanny\u2019s pleasure. Today, even her nanny\u2019s daily nagging sounded like she\u2019s not the real princess, as the stories in her book say, and her mood has subsided.\u201cThat\u2019s why you should be calm on the day of the foundation day\u2026\u201dPhilomel, who had been listening to the nanny\u2019s words with one ear and letting it out with the other, was wide awake at her disparate content.\u201cFoundation day?\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t listen to me, did you?\u201d\u201cCan I participate in the founding festival?\u201cUh? Of course. Since it is a national event, it was talked about going out after a special break from probation on that day.\u201dFounding Day. A nine-year-old founding festival. It was a word she remembered seeing in the book!After her nanny left, Philomel took out the novel, [The Princess Elencia], and scanned the front of it.\u2018Frequently\u2019What she was looking for was the part where the main character, Elencia, was going to participate at an international event in her village when she was nine years old. Elencia was the same age as Philomel, so the foundation festival mentioned there was the one the nanny just mentioned. Elencia tried to go to the event, but she couldn\u2019t go because the event itself was postponed due to heavy rain on the day.She remembered laughing at the part where the foundation festival was postponed due to heavy rain because it made no sense.Yeah, the founding festival was the most important festival of the Belerov Empire. It is customary to receive an oracle every year to set a date and it was confirmed that there would be no rain on that day. In addition, the founding festival, which was scheduled for three or four days, was postponed for a week due to the collapse of the high priest.\u201cThat\u2019s right. It was just a fiction after all.\u201dHow could the high priest who protects the empire fail? She felt better. Now, all he had to do was check the sunny weather on the day of the foundation festival and relax. She would take that book to her father after the foundation festival finished and punish the cheerful writer.Philomel smiled and closed the book.* * *It was definitely supposed to be that way\u2026 The well-dressed Pilomap looked down at it. Bewildered by the thick raindrops\u201c\u2026Your Majesty, it seems we have to postpone the event to a later date.\u201dThe secretary was at a loss for what to do with the unprecedented situation and fell ill with Eustis. They couldn\u2019t even go to the outdoor event prepared in the front yard of the imperial palace, and were sheltering from the rain under the roof of a nearby memorial hall. The head of the event, who broke out in a cold sweat, explained that it was an unprecedented heavy rain.\u201cOkay. The event will be postponed. Set a date again and report back.\u201dAt the emperor\u2019s words, many members of the imperial family and nobles who had gathered to hear the commemorative speech prepared to leave.\u2018Is it really being postponed like this? Like the contents of the novel?\u2019In an instant, her eyes went dark. A novel should be just a novel. It should never become a reality. If not, it meant that the other girl was really her father\u2019s real daughter\u2026\u201cNo! It can\u2019t be!\u201dPhilomel screamed involuntarily and ran off the roof.\u201cYour Highness the Princess! No!\u201dPeople hurriedly tried to bring the princess back in the rain, but Philomel ran frantically and stood in front of Eustis. Then, looking up at him, she eagerly opened his mouth.\u201cFather.\u201dThere was a fine crack between Eustis\u2019 beautiful eyebrows.\u201cPlease, please don\u2019t postpone the founding festival. Yes? You can do it inside the memorial hall. So let\u2019s proceed as planned.\u201dEmbarrassed by the sudden behavior of the princess, everyone was busy paying attention to father and daughter.\u201cI beg of you. Please\u201dPhilomel\u2019s eyes were wet with water, whether it was rain or tears.\u201c\u2026 Princess, that can\u2019t be the case. Please keep your cool.\u201dOne of her maids who served Philomel came beside her and whispered. She knew. Philomel was well aware of the absurdity of having a commemorative speech indoors. Byeollerop was an empire founded under the protection of the Sun God. The founding festival was meaningful only when it was held under a sunny sky. It wasn\u2019t just acting because of the inconvenience of outdoor activities.She knew. But, but\u2026\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dThe emperor\u2019s gaze toward Philomel was soon withdrawn.\u201cOh, Her Highness the Princess\u2026\u201dThe secretary, Count Pollan, hesitantly said so as he looked around at the rest of the audience.\u201cDoes His Majesty have to listen to the child\u2019s complaints one by one? That\u2019s because she wants to see the festival and blocks the emperor\u2019s way?\u201dEveryone held their breath at the anger lurking beneath the blue eyes. Many people were well aware of the fact that the emperor, unlike his beautiful appearance, could be as cruel as a demon. Suspicion that he assassinated the former emperor in order to ascend the throne was spread in the dark.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dEustis relentlessly turned away. Starting with him, the attendees left one by one. Each of them glanced at the princess, who was still standing in the rain, but did not speak to her. There was nothing good about being involved with the princess, who was only hated by the emperor.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then, from a few steps away, her eyes met red eyes looking this way.\u201c\u2026.Majesty.\u201dIt was her fianc\u00e9, Nazar Ave Riden, born a year before Philomel.\u201cNazar, this is not a good moment. Let\u2019s go back at once.\u201dAt that moment, his father, the Duke of Avrydon, grabbed Nassar and took him away.\u201cFather, but\u2026\u201d\u201cHurry.\u201dThe boy, who had hesitated at the duke\u2019s resolute voice, reluctantly moved on. Unlike his fianc\u00e9, not a single drop of rain hit him, and the dry boy drifted farther away.Philomel, too, was soon brought back to her quarters by the hands of her maids. She went into a bathtub filled with warm water and thawed her body, but her heart was still cold. Only Eustis\u2019 back figure came to mind.\u201cWhat? What were you guys doing while the princess was doing that!\u201dShe couldn\u2019t see the nanny, who did not accompany her to the event because of back pain, making a fuss after hearing the story. Coming out of her bathroom, the nanny stood with her cane.\u201cI can never get past this. I didn\u2019t want to go this far either, but I think you\u2019ll get used to it after being scolded.\u201dMatch-! Match! Match!A slender cane repeatedly hit the white calf.\u2018Sick. It hurts so much.\u2019Philomel shed tears, using the pain in her calf as an excuse. Even though the painful part was separate, she couldn\u2019t appeal to anyone. After the corporal punishment, the nanny said, \u201cReading is poisonous. You won\u2019t say a word that\u2019s wrong,\u201d she muttered in full audibility, \u201cIt seems that probation is not enough, so you will enter the special management system from now on. You\u2019d better be prepared.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201cDid you understand? I will always watch over the princess!\u201dThe nanny said the same thing to her several times before she left.\u201cIt\u2019s true, princess. Why did you do that?\u201d\u201cTell the nanny that she was wrong unconditionally. That way, the princess and we won\u2019t get scolded.\u201dPhilomel felt the hand of the maids lubricating her calf, and she stared blankly at the floor. When Philomel didn\u2019t respond, they must have been taken aback. The maids looked at each other and offered her comforting words.\u201cDon\u2019t be too heartbroken. Nanny is moody, so she won\u2019t be angry for too much time.\u201d\u201cAnd I heard from the chief chamberlain earlier that it has been decided that the postponed construction international event will be held in a week. At that time, will Nanny allow us to see the festival with Her Highness?\u201d\u201c\u2026one week?\u201d\u201cYes, in a week. The High Priest collapsed in the returning carriage.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it too late? We can do it in two or three days.\u201dPhilomel asked in a trembling voice.\u201cI do not know. Nothing like this has ever happened to him, and the High Priest must be shocked that the sacred ceremony was interrupted because of the rain at the time he assumed the official ritual.\u201dAnother maid also helped.\u201cPeople are whispering that the blessings of the gods who protect the empire have been exhausted.\u201dThe legitimacy of the Belerov family came from the power of God. There was room for it to be heard that raising questions about divine protection was denying the legitimacy of the imperial family.\u201cHey, there\u2019s no word that can\u2019t be safe!\u201dWhen her colleague noticed, she babbled as if the maid had made an excuse.\u201c\u2026No, it\u2019s just what mothers and fathers are saying that doesn\u2019t mean anything! That\u2019s how it sounds\u2026\u201dPhilomel waved her hand helplessly.She said, \u201cOkay. Go away.\u201dAfter everyone had gone, Philomel limped over to her desk.Inside her drawer was a book with the title <Princess Elensia> in a brown cover, just as it had been put in it. How likely is it that the founding festival, which has never been postponed since the founding of the country, will be postponed this year? And how likely is it that a fiction book will hit it by chance? Besides, everything that happened after that was the same. Even the collapse of the high priest, and the event being postponed for a week because of it. The cruel realization spread like ink. The appearance was the same as any other popular romance novel, but this was not a novel.\u2018Prophecy\u2019The hand holding the book trembled.The emperor was not Philomel\u2019s father.She was fake* * *The next morning. Perhaps because of the rain the day before, Philomel eventually caught a bad cold.\u201cPrincess. Time to wake up.\u201dThe nanny shook Philomel awake.\u201c\u2026Nurse. I can\u2019t get up, it hurts. It must be a cold.\u201dPhilomel suppressed a cough and spoke in a low voice. Her head was spinning and her throat was so sore that it hurted to swallow saliva. However, despite Philomel\u2019s appeal, the nanny did not budge.\u201cAre you faking it again? You can\u2019t get over today by pretending to be sick. His Majesty is calling the princess for yesterday\u2019s work. If you\u2019re going to be so scared, why did you make such a fuss in the first place?\u201dIn the past, she had skipped several classes on the excuse that she was sick because she found the various classes she took every day so difficult and boring.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m not faking it. It really hurts.\u201dPhilomel answered in a hushed voice. It was definitely her fault for skipping, but she was saddened when she was suspected of malingering.\u201cBecause I want you to wake up\u2026 You\u2019re really hot.\u201dThe nanny\u2019s eyes widened as she placed her hand on Philomel\u2019s arm.After a while, the doctor who came to see Philomel at the call of her nanny diagnosed it as a simple fever. He said she would get better if she took some medicine and got some rest. Philomel barely managed to gorge herself on the red soup as she had no appetite and had a hard time passing something in her throat.The nanny said to Philomel, who swallowed her pills and went back to bed, \u201cI told His Majesty that you have a cold. But you know very well that I\u2019m not the kind of person who will take care of you in pain, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHow many people must have regarded the princess as immature yesterday. I can\u2019t even lift my face in public. What kind of festival was that?\u201dPeople seemed to regard Philomel\u2019s sudden behavior as a child\u2019s whining.\u2018How nice it would be if that was true\u2019Philomel thought blankly.\u201cGet some rest. If you need anything, call the maids in the next room.\u201dSaying that, the nanny left.Shortly after, Philomel fell asleep quickly under the influence of her medicine. How much time passed until her eyes opened by themselves? A cold sweat soaked Philomel\u2019s whole body. She had a scary dream. She herself was executed and Eustis was an insensitive spectator of her fake daughter dying alongside her real daughter.Her little body trembled.She wanted to live. She was afraid to die. Se had never wanted to die.\u2018Will my father really kill me?\u2019Even though she already knew the answer, she was madly tempted to deny it.What if Philomel lives steadily from now on? What if she becomes the daughter her father desires? Maybe the future would be different. Even if the book said she\u2019s fake, anyway he hasn\u2019t considered her his daughter for 9 years. She might have a little warmth. She wanted to check right now. She wanted to ask.\u201cI have to go\u2026\u201dHer body was still heavy and her head hurt, but not to the point of immobility so Philomel slipped out of her room.It was already close to noon. In the sense of getting a good night\u2019s sleep, the nanny had said that today\u2019s lunch would be prepared two hours later than usual. Even if she left her seat for a while, no one would realize that Philomel was gone.She crept through the hallways, sneaking around so as not to be seen, but the sound of conversation leaked from the room next to her. It was where the maids stayed.\u201cWhat kind of trouble is this because of the princess?\u201dHearing the annoyed voice, Philomel stopped involuntarily and put his ear to the door. Four or five people were having a conversation.\u201cShh. Someone may be listening.\u201d\u201cWhat? We\u2019re the only ones here. The princess fell asleep from the drug energy.\u201d\u201cShe isn\u2019t wrong. If she hadn\u2019t had accidents every day, we wouldn\u2019t have had our wages cut.\u201dThe man who said that was Martin, the escort knight in charge of Philomel. Not working and flirting with her maids, it was clear negligence.One of the maids agreed.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cNanny is just catching us like mice!\u201d\u201cThe princess was at fault, but it\u2019s always us who get scolded.\u201d, said Martin flirting.\u201cThe sadness of the lower ones, well. If you\u2019re dissatisfied, then you too will be born as His Majesty\u2019s daughter in your next life.\u201dThe maid with an exceptionally loud voice shouted.\u201cAh! I really want to do that. If I were the princess, she would have been loved by His Majesty because of how pretty I would be!\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? You are dreaming.\u201dA roar of laughter filled the room. Everyone seemed happy.\u201cOh, I really hate Philomel.\u201dThe words someone threw at her stuck in Philomel\u2019s chest.\u201cAre you crazy? What if someone hears you calling Her Highness by her name?\u201d\u201cWhy. Because she is the princess? What kind of princess is not even treated as a daughter by His Majesty the Emperor?\u201d\u201cStill\u2026\u201d\u201cFurthermore, Philomel doesn\u2019t even have divine powers, the symbol of her royal family.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if she\u2019s in the room, but she\u2019s the first one of the direct imperial family to be born without divine power.\u201d\u201cOnly the pattern is the royal family.\u201dPhilomel\u2019s little shoulders shrank.\u201cI\u2019m still envious. Someone was slapped on the cheek by a nanny for not paying attention, but the person in question slept peacefully.\u201d\u201cI want to see the festival and wear my new clothes in front of a lot of nobles.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know why they do not break the engagement between the princess and the Duke of Ave Riden.\u201d\u201cShe is not a suitable match for the little Lord, who has already been rumored to be clever.\u201d\u201cAh, did you see the expression on the face of the little Lord the other day when the princess was feeding him a cake?\u201d\u201cHe really hated it. Poor princess, she didn\u2019t even notice.\u201d\u201cIf she had such a sense, would she have been hated by His Majesty?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Well, the other day\u2026\u201dThat was enough. She didn\u2019t want to hear any more, so Philomel withdrew from the door.Her tears welled up as she recalled the faces of those who had been kindly concerned about Philomel\u2019s well-being until earlier. Their care was fake. There was no one on her side there.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 4": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/There Is No Place For FakesCH 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201c\u2026This is not the time. You have to go to your father.\u201dPhilo Mel wiped away her tears and hurried her feet. It was Eustis who held her own lifeline, not them.\u2018So I won\u2019t get hurt.\u2019She walked slowly, looking around her. Since she was still young, she lived in the palace of her emperor without being granted her own palace. Besides, for some reason, there were fewer people in the palace at some point. Evading the few attendants, she arrived in front of the emperor\u2019s office. Due to the nature of Eustis, who does not have a separate escort in the palace, there was no one near the office.Philomel gently opened her door.\u201c\u2026 So persistent, Pollan.\u201dThrough the narrow crack in the door, she could see the interior of the office. Despite the splendid decorations, Eustis and Count Pollan were in a room that had a rustic feel. Count Pollan was in the middle of giving a mantra to the emperor who was sitting in front of the desk.\u201cBut, Your Majesty. Since the princess is unwell, wouldn\u2019t it be better to visit her?\u201dJust in time, their topic was Philomel.Rather, it was great. She would be able to know what Eutis thought of her without asking him herself. So Philomel quietly listened to them.The emperor frowned and said.\u201cWhy do you care so much about it? Do you even feel sympathy for her being sick? I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be faking it again anyway.\u201d\u201cThe courtier said she caught a really bad cold this time.\u201d\u201cTherefore?\u201d\u201cIf His Majesty visits, great power will be given to the princess\u2026\u201d\u201cA cold is not so much.\u201dCount Pollan was silent for a moment. He had been loyal to Eustis since he was a prince. So he was relatively free to ask personal questions.\u201cYour Majesty, why are you so hard on your daughter? Isn\u2019t she your only blood relative?\u201dPhilomel\u2019s chest tightened. She herself was always curious. Why didn\u2019t he give affection to Philomel?And the emperor\u2019s answer was shocking.\u201cI never once felt it was my child.\u201dShe felt like if something hit her head.\u201cDo you think the reason Isabella died was because of the princess? So\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201d\u201c\u2026I apologize.\u201dPollan immediately lowered his head at Eustis\u2019 sad expression. The story of his wife who died in front of him was a kind of taboo.Sullenly, the emperor said.\u201cI once thought so. It was very disappointing. To the point where I wanted to take her life with these hands.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBut that is a thing of the past. I have no feelings now.\u201d\u201cWhy\u2026\u201d\u201cBecause there are no expectations. I didn\u2019t want it to fill Isabella\u2019s void. I would be satisfied if she had a minimal role as successor.\u201dEustis, who pressed his forehead with a tired face, continued.\u201cBut what are the results? She is insincere in class, and she only produces insignificant results. Yesterday, she even showed ugliness in front of many people.\u201d\u201c\u2026Princess Philomel is working hard too. It\u2019s got to be a bit messy sometimes.\u201d\u201cIf trouble is effort, then you are right.\u201dEustis laughed, pulling only one corner of his mouth.\u201cYou are too strict. The princess is only nine years old. It is natural that there are immature parts.\u201d\u201cAt that age, I had a feud with my blood brothers.\u201d\u201cThe situation was like that then, and Your Majesty was outstanding from a young age\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like Isabella, and she doesn\u2019t look like me at all.\u201d\u201cEven if she doesn\u2019t look like her, she is His Majesty\u2019s daughter.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Stop now.\u201dHe got up from his seat and approached the cupboard lined with bottles in one corner of the room. From the back pouring the amber liquid into the glass, the will to talk had already disappeared. Anything more than that would only irritate the emperor. Eustis was slightly more tolerant of Pollan than the rest of him, but only slightly.As Count Pollan tried to step down, he looked back at the emperor for the last time.\u201c\u2026Do you really feel no affection for the princess?\u201dPhilomel had to leave quickly before Count Pollan came out the door. However, her feet did not come off at all. She had to listen to Eustis\u2019 answer. Philomel\u2019s fate depended on that answer.Eustis slowly opened his mouth.\u201cYes. Now I only want one thing from her.\u201dPhilomel took a deep breath in her.\u201cLiving as a dead mouse. I don\u2019t want to have to pay attention to her not to know if she is there or not.\u201dIt was such a cold and solid answer. As if it would never change.* * *When she came to her senses, she had already returned to her room.Shortly after Eustis\u2019 last words, Count Pollan stayed in the office to retort, allowing Philomel to return undetected. And then she collapsed onto her bed.\u201cNow what?\u201dHer father. No, the emperor did not regard her as his daughter at all, nor did he have the slightest interest in her. If Elencia appeared in the future and it turns out that Philomel was a fake, he will not forgive her. What if she lived a kind life without acting out her vices like \u2018Philomel\u2019 in the book?\u2018Wouldn\u2019t it save only her life?\u2019It didn\u2019t seem like an improbable story at all. Even in the novel she turns out to be fake and she didn\u2019t die right away. It was thanks to Elencia, who took pity on her and begged Eustis to forgive her.Although the \u2018evil\u2019 Philomel, jealous of Elencia, pays her the rest of her favor as her enemy and she is eventually executed. She thought, \u2018Unlike in the book, I might be able to escape death if I know my place well and act according to the circumstances\u2026\u2019\u201cBut\u2026\u201dThat alone wasn\u2019t enough. She did not want to risk her life on such a flimsy hope. It was a precarious life, not knowing when she would die if she offended the emperor even a little.Suddenly, the maids and escorts she saw today came to mind. They had an obvious animosity towards Mel. Now it\u2019s just gossip, but what if it turns out that she isn\u2019t the princess?\u201c\u2026 They won\u2019t leave me alone.\u201dThe scary thing was that they might not be the only ones who hated her. If they spread bad rumors about Philomel and frame her, \u2018can I guarantee my life even then??\u2019Inversely, that was not the case. Philomel wanted a greater chance of survival. She never wanted to die. It was then that an idea popped into her mind.Let\u2019s run away. Even if it\u2019s impossible right now, let\u2019s leave this place before Elencia appears. It was the moment when the life plan of the young fake princess was decided.* * *After that, until just before bedtime, Philomel was preoccupied with fleshing out her escape plan, which she had conjured up throughout the day. She went to bed early, but because of her complicated brain, it was late when she fell asleep. So late at night, she didn\u2019t even notice someone entering her room.\u201cIt\u2019s me, Princess. Come to His Majesty\u2026\u201dEustis beckoned her nurse to wake the sleeping child.\u2018What I\u2019m doing?\u2019Looking down at Mel\u2019s white, round face, the emperor mocked himself. Count Pollan did not back down easily and kept bringing up the topic of the princess to notice Eustis. He could have just ignored it, but when Count Pollan kept mentioning it, he felt like he had to check on her daughter once in a while.Maybe it was because the yellow eyes that were looking directly at him in the rain yesterday seemed somehow solemn and desperate. Of course it would be an illusion. She was the emperor\u2019s only daughter, what desperation could such a blessed child feel? However, it seemed that Paulan\u2019s words that the child was quite sick were true, even by the naked eye.\u201c\u2026 ji\u201dSuddenly a voice came out of the little one\u2019s mouth.\u201c\u2026father.\u201dHe wondered if she had woken up, but Philomel had still closed her eyes, she was just tossing and turning. She was a simple drool talker.\u201cI\u2026 a good girl\u2026 I\u2019ll be. Killer\u2026 So\u2026 Don\u2019t kill\u2026\u201dA soft sound that seems to go out when blown. A few more words were heard, but most of them were close to mumbling, and that was all Eustis understood. Then he started to shed tears even while sleeping, wondering what was so sad about it.For some reason, Eustis couldn\u2019t take his eyes off Philomel\u2019s face. He had vague memories. Eustis, pondering what it was, soon recalled a memory of his distant days. A child who barely managed to fall asleep every night, trembling with fear that he might die. He was the \u2018He\u2019 of his childhood. Surprisingly, he was similar to Philomel now.It was the first time in his life that he felt that his daughter resembled him.In order to survive and to stand at the peak, he was in a hurry to pile up blood and sin, so he completely forgot that such a time even existed. The Emperor impulsively reached out and wiped the tears from the child\u2019s cheek. The feelings and hopes of the time were revived, albeit very faintly.\u2018Back then, I wanted someone to reach out to me like this.\u2019Tight.A small, plump hand grasped Eustis\u2019s fingertips. That, too, was done while asleep, but he was a little surprised. The sensation of touching the skin of anyone other than his dead wife was very unfamiliar, but not unpleasant. The child\u2019s hand was much smaller and warmer than expected. He felt a little warmth for a while and went back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 5": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/There Is No Place For FakesCH 5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen Philomel woke up the next day, the nanny asked if anything had happened the night before with a puzzled look on her face.\u201cSomething special? Nothing in particular. Why, what happened?\u201d\u201c\u2026No. It\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t remember it.\u201dWhat happened? Her nanny changed the subject as Philomel looked at her inquiringly. \u201cMore than that,\u201d she said, \u201cHis Majesty the Emperor sent you the fruit of the World Tree, which is said to be especially good for restoring energy.\u201d\u201c\u2026His Majesty?\u201dPhilomel asked, widening her eyes.\u201cYeah. The next time you see him, thank him for giving you this precious gift. Why should you just sleep because you have a cold?\u201dThe World Tree was a very sacred tree located in the center of the continent, and its fruit was known to be excellent for rejuvenation. The elixir, which was said to make even an eighty-year-old man lively, was like a cold medicine to the emperor of the empire. It\u2019s not unreasonable since dozens of fruits were offered as offerings every year. However, giving it to Philomel was unexpected.If she didn\u2019t know anything, she would have been overjoyed knowing that it was her father\u2019s love and interest. But now it\u2019s just \u2018Polan sent it in the name of the emperor.\u2019 She only heard dry impressions. She was grateful for the count\u2019s favor, but the object of his favor was not Philomel, but the emperor\u2019s daughter.Philomel answered business likely.\u201cOkay. Thank him for the undeserved kindness. The fruit will be consumed with the medicine.\u201d\u201cOh. Is that all?\u201d\u201cWhy? What more do you need?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d\u201cOh, and after hearing that the princess was ill, Prince Avrydon asked to visit her.\u201dPrince Avrydon. It had to be Nazar Avrydon, who was engaged to Philomel.\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI heard that the prince will visit you when you\u2019re feeling well, but when would be a good moment?\u201dThanks to her resting all day yesterday, Philomel\u2019s condition wasn\u2019t that bad. She had a cold, and she said, \u201cIf possible, can you schedule it this afternoon? If they say they have other plans, I\u2019ll have to see them tomorrow.\u201dPhilomel replied, recalling the boy standing next to her in the rain.Shortly thereafter, she received a reply from the duke that they would visit in the afternoon. Philomel squeezed the hem of her blanket, remembering the well-groomed face of Nazar Avrydon. It was a chance for her to see the sincerity of Nassar, who was always kind to Philomel.When she found out that Nazar, her fianc\u00e9e, was the male protagonist in her novel that leads to Elencia, Philomel shuddered at it. Her father and her status weren\u2019t enough, and she even stole her fianc\u00e9.In the novel, Nazar was reckless, romantic, and devoted like a male protagonist in a romance novel. Of course, limited to the main character, Elencia. He was very different from the Nassar Philomel had known.\u2018But he wasn\u2019t for me in the first place\u2026\u2019If it was an unavoidable blow, it was better to be hit at once. Being beaten over several days only made the bitterness last longer.Philomel walked towards her appointment.\u201cNazar, straighten your expression. Her Highness, the princess, is coming soon, so don\u2019t show her a sad face.\u201cWhat?\u201dA voice from her private drawing room stopped Philomel in her tracks. She stopped her maid, who was about to announce the princess\u2019s arrival.Nazar and the duke were chatting, as they must have thought that since Philomel was always late for appointments, she would come late today as well.\u2018Until now, I only wanted to show Nazar a pretty side, so I must have been late every time\u2026\u2019There was no need to worry about it anymore, so she was dressed simply.\u201cBut Father, today I\u2026\u201d\u201cI know you are upset that you couldn\u2019t make it to the appointment with your friends because you were visiting her. But you have to do what you\u2019ve been given. Have you forgotten who you are?\u201d\u201c\u2026I know it well.\u201dWhen the duke spoke quietly, Nazar couldn\u2019t let out any more bullshit and shut his mouth. Philomel counted from one to ten before entering the living room.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I greeted Her Highness, the princess. How is your body?\u201dWhen the Duke greeted her first, Nazar also erased his childlike appearance from before and stood in front of Philomel.\u201cI couldn\u2019t help but worry when I heard that you were ill.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a while. Duke\u2026 and Nassar. My cold is almost gone. Thank you for your concern.\u201dAfter the formal conversation, the duke said he had a meeting to attend and withdrew from his seat. Before he left, he made eye contact with his son and did not forget to convey the unspoken pressure. It meant not to offend Philomel. After all, he knew that the princess was obsessed with his son, but he did not neglect her attention, which was duke-like.After sitting down facing the boy, Philomel opened her mouth.\u201cNazar.\u201d\u201cYes, Princess.\u201dShe remembered the first time she saw Nazar. Philomel fell in love at first sight with a handsome boy with a mature atmosphere. His unchildish personality and his rare platinum-colored hair evoked a mysterious aura that appealed to her. Even his red eyes, which others commented to be creepy, were to her liking. So she couldn\u2019t be happier that Nazar was her fianc\u00e9.\u201c..Majesty\u2026 Your Highness, Princess. Are you okay?\u201d\u2018Ah.\u2019\u201cOh, yes. It\u2019s okay.\u201dNazar looked at her with a worried look on his face. She must have been lost in her old memories for a while.\u201cI am worried that you are overdoing it.\u201dNazar was really nice. In the past, she had no doubt that kindness came from a heart like her own. In fact, Nassar was more kind and courteous than any person Philomel had ever met. However, after watching <Princess Elencia>, that old belief began to crack.Philomel called him once again. \u201cNazar.\u201d\u201cYes, tell me.\u201d\u201cIf my body fully recovers, where should we go on a picnic?\u201dWhen the weather was nice, they would sometimes go out with a basket of food packed by the maids. At most, it was all about going to the garden within the palace grounds accompanied by a lot of subordinates, but it was Philomel\u2019s favorite time.\u201cGood.\u201dNazar nodded his head kindly.\u201cWhere shall we go for the picnic?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go where Your Highness wants.\u201d\u201cIs there anywhere Nazar wants to go?\u201d\u201cI like wherever I go with Your Highness.\u201dIt was an impeccable attitude and answer.\u201cNo, picnics don\u2019t go well with the weather these days. The day before yesterday, the Festival was also postponed. What do you think, Nazar?\u201d\u201cListening to what you said, it seems to me that you are right.\u201d\u201cIt would be nice to have a picnic while eating snacks indoors.\u201d\u201cYeah. That\u2019s good too.\u201d\u201cMy maid told me that there is a piano player who is the talk of the town. I think it would be really cool to invite him to play with us.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard of it. That\u2019s a good idea in my opinion.\u201dIt was still impeccable, but it was just an answer.\u2018Oh, Nassar doesn\u2019t want to do anything with me.\u2019, Philomel realized.From the beginning to the end, Nassar did not express his will at all. He only moderately responded to Philomel\u2019s opinion. She had previously believed that this attitude of letting her do whatever she wanted was due to affection. In that novel, Nazar was Elencia\u2019s man, eager to do anything she wanted before it even came out of her mouth. An ordinary man in love who was at a loss in front of the woman he loved.It was possible for him to always remain calm and polite in front of Philomel\u2026 because he did not love her at all.\u2018It must have been the Duke\u2019s doctor, not Nassar, who wanted to visit today.\u2019 Through the experience of the past few days, she was able to see the world surrounded by mustard seeds very well to my bare eyes.\u201cThen we will hire a performer. When the princess gets well, if she gives me a message\u2026\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dPhilomel cut off Nazar and stood up.\u201cYeah?\u201dNazar looked at the princess with bewildered eyes.\u201cLet\u2019s pretend that story didn\u2019t exist. Thank you for coming to see me. My body hasn\u2019t completely healed yet and I\u2019m tired, so please go away.\u201dPhilomel tried to smile respectfully, like Nazar, and quickly let out what she had in mind.\u201cAnd you don\u2019t have to come to the palace to play with me twice a week from now on.\u201d\u201cWhat is that\u2026\u201d\u201cI unnecessarily took away too much of your precious time. You must have had your own schedule. From now on feel free to spend your time with other friends.\u201d\u201cPlease wait. Somehow, I have offended Her Highness, haven\u2019t I?\u201cThere is absolutely nothing wrong with what you have said.\u201dNazar was confused by Philomel\u2019s smiling attitude.\u201cNo matter how engaged one is, I\u2019m saying this because I don\u2019t have enough time to make other friends because I see you too often. Don\u2019t I need friends of the same sex other than you?\u201d\u201c\u2026 All right.\u201d\u201cThen goodbye.\u201dLeaving Nazar, who answered with his unseen face, Philomel left. After her reception, Mel returned to her room and checked her expression in the mirror. Did she laugh properly like Nazar earlier? A few times she closed her eyes and practiced that plausible smile, and she turned to her reflection. That was the mask Philomel would wear from now on.She would imitate Nazar. She would be kind to everyone, but without giving her heart to anyone.Not even Nazar\u2026 so when she ran away, she would be able to go without leaving any regrets.The girl in the raw mirror had a lonely smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After drinking the tea sent by Eustis, Philomel regained her strength. She felt that her body and head were lighter than before.In the princess\u2019s literature class, Philoman, who closed the book he was reading, said to the literature teacher.\u201cI read everything. What should I read next?\u201d\u201cHave you read it already? If you\u2019ve just turned over the bookshelf\u2026\u201d\u201cI really read it all. If you\u2019re in doubt, ask questions from what I had read.\u201dPhilomel got all the questions given by the teacher right. Her nursemaid and her teachers watched with wide eyes as the princess eagerly attended her class, almost as soon as she got up from her sick bed. It was completely different from before, when she showed no interest in the content of her class and just spent time doing something else. She said there was something Philomel didn\u2019t understand, and when she voluntarily organized her questions and went to him, the elderly foreign language teacher even freaked out.She also spent her free time quietly taking supplementary classes or reading books. And her time with Nazar was no exception.\u201c\u2026ness\u2026 Her Highness the Princess.\u201d\u201cUm, Nazar. I have a question, when was the Battle of Decilia?\u201d\u201cIt was in the 132nd year of the Imperial calendar.\u201d\u201cOh right. Thanks for letting me know. After all, Nazar is smart.\u201dNazar glanced at his fianc\u00e9 sitting across from him ,memorizing a history book.\u201cShall we spend time doing our own homework today? Nazar, from now on, bring a pastime from your house. It\u2019s once a week, but it\u2019s a shame if you waste your precious time in vain.\u201dAs soon as she met his face, Philomel said that, opened the book, and began to study without paying any attention to Nazar. Philomel\u2019s gaze lingered on the book, even on the occasional question she did not know.Permission was granted to borrow a book from the imperial library for his empty hand, but he didn\u2019t feel like it. Nazar emptied only the teacup placed in front of him like a machine, feeling like a borrowed barley sack. It was the first time he had been so free since he entered the palace to play with the princess. Up until now, after Philomel had moved as she wanted, it was always time to go back in an instant.\u2018Are you mad at me?\u2019Even though he knew it wasn\u2019t polite, Nazar stared intently at the small face that was concentrated enough to bury in the book. Far from being angry, Philomel always smiled at Nazar, but he felt a strange sense of distance.It was awkward. The sense of distance, as if blocked by a thin glass wall, and Philomel, who had no interest in Nazar. At that awkwardness, the young lord tilted his head. For some reason he was not in a good mood. In the past, there were times when he wished that the princess would become a little more mature\u2026 but for some reason, it wasn\u2019t good at all.* * *The change wasn\u2019t just that. The number of times the princess would lose her temper to those under her was markedly reduced.Clink!\u201cAh. Sorry! Princess!\u201dA teacup dropped by her maid shattered. The blue bird painted on the surface was split into three pieces. The teacup was a gift given to her by Prince Avrydon on her birthday last year, and was one of the princess\u2019s most treasured possessions.\u201cSo\u2026 sorry! I\u2019m so sorry, ah!\u201dThe maid trembled at the thought that she would be severely punished since it was her fault. In fact, even if the princess was angry, it wouldn\u2019t be much of a problem if her nanny would stop her, but recently the nanny had fallen out of favor with her. She went back to her hometown on vacation because she forgot her souvenirs.The maid tightened her heart, waiting for Philomel\u2019s fierce roar. But\u2026\u201cWhat are you doing? Won\u2019t you clean it up right away?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cThe carpet will get wet. Get rid of it and leave.\u201d\u201cOh, yes. I see!\u201dThe maid hastily picked up the broken pieces and put them together. What Philomel said next was even more unexpected.\u201cBe careful not to cut your hands. Not only is this teacup important, people are important too.\u201dTo think that the princess, who would have been on her way in the past, was even worried about her maid\u2019s hands. She was a startled maid, and from that day on she recounted the strange experience she had had whenever she met her courtiers. At first, most people regarded the princess\u2019 change as a fleeting whim.\u201cI think His Majesty was scolded by something during the founding festival.\u201d\u201cIf so, how far will she go? Anyway, the day after tomorrow, it will be back to normal.\u201d\u201cAnyway, the palace will be quiet for a while.\u201dThey remembered her princess\u2019 usual character too well. She was a sensitive and stubborn child. She was a troublemaker who neglects her duties as a princess and only thinks of fun.However, as the change lasted for a day, two days, and several days, everyone had no choice but to think differently. The mischievous princess had finally come of age. Philomel\u2019s desperate struggle for her survival was nothing more than an irony in the eyes of others.\u201cIt\u2019s worthwhile to teach the princess with all my heart. If I had just retired because of a little back pain, I would have regretted it.\u201dThe nanny pretended to be the great educator who rectified Philomel, as if all credit was hers.\u201cYou are such a great nanny.\u201d\u201cYou are wonderful.\u201dPhilomel let her nanny\u2019s arrogance and her maids\u2019 flattery go in one ear. But their words concerning Philomel reached the Emperor\u2019s ears, and after a few days Philomel was called by him. It was a lunch spot. In front of the two people who were seated at either end of the long table, rare dishes were set one after another.Philomel was so nervous that she didn\u2019t even know where the food was going under the Emperor\u2019s sharp gaze, but she tried to stay calm.\u2018Why did he call me?\u2019He couldn\u2019t possibly have wanted to come and dine with her daughter now.The emperor opened his heavy mouth.\u201cI heard the story. You\u2019re dedicated to her studies. That\u2019s a good attitude.\u201dIt took her a while to realize that it was a compliment because it was a nonchalant tone. A meal with her father, a compliment from his mouth, it was all a first. It was only when the things she wanted so much lost their meaning that they came into her hands.Philomel responded politely.\u201c\u2026thank you. But there\u2019s still a long way to go.\u201d\u201cYour masters praised you until their mouths were dry.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to His Majesty\u2019s appointment of great teachers.\u201d\u2018Your majesty?\u2019Eustis raised his eyebrows at the strangeness of the words. Everyone referred to him as that, but didn\u2019t Philomel always call him \u2018Father\u2019?\u201c\u2026You have grown in a very mature way while I couldn\u2019t see you.\u201d\u201cNow, as a member of the imperial family, I have to work hard to have the dignity appropriate for that.\u201dPhilomel laughed. It was a smile that did not open her mouth enough to show her teeth, but only slightly raised the corners of her mouth.The emperor gazed at Philomel\u2019s \u2018aristocratic smile\u2019. Had he known his daughter a little better, he would have been keenly aware of the unnaturalness of the recent change. However, Eustis did not feel anything other than a slight discomfort.\u201cI get it. Keep working hard like that.\u201d\u201cYeah. I will keep that in mind.\u201d\u201cCome to think of it, are you feeling better now? Is your cold completely cured?\u201dPhilomel\u2019s fork, which was moving on the plate, stopped for a moment. She didn\u2019t expect Eustis to ask after her.\u201c\u2026I have finished taking the medicine Your Majesty sent me.\u201dShe felt strange because he seemed to be genuinely concerned.\u2018No. I can\u2019t be weak at the goodwill he throws at me.\u2019Philomel had her heart sealed once more. He was the man who would one day kill her once it were found she was a fake, if she did not act obediently.\u201cThat\u2019s good. Your mother was also very weak.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah.\u201dJust as the emperor was not her father, the empress whom she had thought of as her mother for nearly ten years was not Philomel\u2019s mother.Eustis, who had been staring at the air for a short time, looked at Philomel again.\u201cIn the sense of praising hard work, if there is anything you want, tell me and listen to it if I can.\u201d\u2018Praise, worry, reward next?\u2019Philo Mel swallowed her saliva. What she had been waiting for came. The emperor made a clear distinction between reward and punishment when dealing with everyone. Severe punishment for those who were sluggish. Rewards for those who performed well. For that reason he expected to say the same to Philomel.But she shouldn\u2019t tell him what she wanted right away when he asked her. Philomel hid her true feelings for the time being.\u201cThere is nothing. It is an honor just for His Majesty to know.\u201dThe emperor said slowly, bringing his wine glass to his mouth.\u201cYou are humble. However, it is better to be moderately greedy to be on the throne.\u201d\u2018I wasn\u2019t going to say that, but I guess I can just leave it out.\u2019Philo Mel pretended to be troubled, then brought it out.\u201cActually, I should have said that I wanted it\u2026 There is something I want to ask of Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dPhilomel conveyed the wish she had been waiting for to the emperor. She hoped that the acting looked as natural and sincere as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 7": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/There Is No Place For FakesCH 7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter eating, Philomel returned to her room.\u201cPrincess! Are you here? So what did His Majesty say\u2026\u201dAs soon as she heard that, Philomel spotted a figure entering, followed by a nanny who was trying to pry into conversation with the Emperor.\u201cNo. What did the Count come here for?\u201dIt was Count Pollan.\u201cHis Majesty has ordered you to retire. You have worked hard to serve Her Majesty the Princess following Her Majesty the Empress.\u201d\u201cYes? What do you mean by that?\u201dThe nanny didn\u2019t understand Pollan\u2019s words, so she only blinked.\u201cI\u2019ll give you a generous severance pay, so you won\u2019t be disappointed. If you want, I\u2019ll arrange a house for you in the capital city.\u201dPhilomel looked up at her nanny and smiled at her.\u201cNanny, thank you for all this time. Now don\u2019t overdo it and get some rest.\u201d\u201cRetirement! What the hell is this? I have no intention of retiring. I made up my mind to stay by the princess\u2019s side until the end!\u201dAt the word retirement, the nanny was startled. Although she pretended not to be her, the nanny loved the power she enjoyed as the princess\u2019s guardian.\u201cThat loyalty is respectable. But the princess herself told Her Majesty that you had suffered from back pain for a long time.\u201dAlong with the worry that the nanny might collapse soon, Philomel hid behind the Count, and she smiled sinisterly.The grouchy nanny made her excuses.\u201cYeah, that\u2019s not too serious. The Princess probably took it seriously in her young heart\u2026\u201d\u201cI have already confirmed with the other servants. It\u2019s okay if you stop hiding it.\u201dThe nanny must have been bragging about it in the sense of \u2018I dedicate my whole body to be loyal to the imperial family\u2019, but her words were up to her to convey. When Philomel pleaded with her heartfelt concern for her nanny, Eustis ordered her retirement without a word. From his point of view, if the nanny, whom her deceased wife had followed like a mother, collapsed, he would have been in trouble.\u201cSo, as of today, quit your job, recuperate, and take care of yourself. Her Highness, the princess, plans to select and hire her competent handmaids.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m really fine! If you just reconsider\u2026 will be faster.\u201dThe daylight of the maids frolicking in the corner was not good either.\u201c\u2026If the nanny quits, what will we do?\u201d\u201cWe have no choice but to do well with the new lady-in-waiting.\u201d\u201cHow much effort have you given to appeal to the nanny so far? It\u2019s a shame.\u201dThanks to the nanny who didn\u2019t care too much for the rest if she just followed her own words, they had been doing a little work and living well.Philomel\u2019s escape plan was to drive them all out. Anything that feeds on her own mind would only hinder her preparation for escape.That was a good start. Philomel walked with her light steps to her bathroom to wash herself up.* * *A few days later, at Philomel\u2019s residence.Today was the day Philomel first met the Countess Deles that became her new chief maid. Looking at the gray-haired woman in front of her, Philomel thought.\u2018She would have been in a hurry, but Count Pollan brought a pretty nice person.\u2019Countess Deles\u2019 fault was that she lacked a pulpit, but she was well-suited for her lady-in-waiting job as she was gentle and soft-spoken. And how did Philomel, who was seeing her for the first time today, know that? Because Countess Deles was the chief maid serving Elensia in the book. There, Elencia relied on her a lot because she was strict but dignified and honest.The soft-looking Countess Delles politely bowed her head. She said, \u201cIt is a great honor for my family to serve Her Highness. If there\u2019s anything you want me to do, feel free to let me know.\u201dCountess Deles was nervous that the princess, who was said to be picky, would catch her from her first impression. Since she was still at her young age, she rarely appeared in public, but it was a well-known fact that her princess\u2019s formidable personality was difficult to deal with.\u201cNice to meet you. Best wishes in the future.\u201dContrary to rumors that said she was arrogant, the Princess greeted the Countess with a polite smile. During the ensuing conversation, there were no words or actions that were particularly disrespectful. She even gave the impression that she was more grown-up than the average son of aristocrats.\u2018I was worried for nothing.\u2019Half a day after meeting the princess, the countess completely put her mind at ease. According to her observation of the princess\u2019s daily routine, the princess was diligent in everything she did and never treated her subordinates carelessly. Since she was her age, her immaturity was also noticeable, but if she received a little education, she could see a future in which she would grow up to be a role model for the imperial family. The notoriety about the princess also seemed to be one of many rumors in society.\u2018Who the hell has the guts to talk like that about the princess?\u2019, Countess Deles thought to herself.At that time, she covered the little red cheeks of the princess that said, \u201cWould you like to see my closet? I have a lot of pretty clothes.\u201dBoth of them were having a good time refreshing themselves using their spare time.The countess was trying to find a topic of conversation that would appeal to a little girl and she ended up mentioning a trendy new dress, and the princess grabbed her hand to guide her to her dressing room. \u00a0 The Countess, who thought she was far too mature for her age, was happy to see her act like a child and smiled happily.\u00a0 However, when she checked the little girl\u2019s closet, her expression darkened. Philomel babbled, pointing at her dresses one after the other:\u201cThis is my favorite dress, and I bought it last spring\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 I see. They are all pretty.\u201dThere was nothing wrong with the dresses. The problem was in the tidying up inside the closet. At first glance, it looks like the clothes were hanging neatly, but if you look closely, they were randomly mixed regardless of the use of the dress or the sense of the season. Besides, some were stored in a state where the lace was crumpled. If that was the case, the clothes would be damaged quickly and cannot be worn for a long time. So far, it seemed that the princess had been given a new dress right away, so she skipped over it.\u2018But her maids made a mistake that not even maids from noble families would make!\u2019The Countess of Delres glanced at Philomel\u2019s maids with her cold eyes. She felt that their attitude was sloppy from the time she was served tea, even though she did not point it out.\u2018Is this really all there is?\u2019One obvious mistake usually means ten hidden ones. She thought she should get a thorough look at what they\u2019ve been doing. The princess might need a bunch of new maids.After a while, the princess\u2019s maids completely shut up. It was because the officials had entered into an investigation at the request of Countess Deles. Not only were they negligent in their duties, but they were also caught using the budget allotted to the princess for personal use. Of course, it was natural they were expelled, but only the nanny was the one who cheated the most.All those involved were severely punished. From what Philomel later heard, the nanny didn\u2019t even acknowledged that it was a big mistake. The old woman was getting older.\u201cIs it such a great sin that a poor old woman was confused and no longer knew it was her money or not? How unfair! If Lady Isabella was alive, how could she have felt sad for me, who she treated like a mother\u2026\u201dThe maid, who witnessed the nanny crying and protesting at the imperial palace, told Philomel in detail what she had seen. It wasn\u2019t just a few pennies, it wasn\u2019t a plausible excuse because the number of times she was confused and the amount of money was enormous for a momentary mistake. She thought her nanny was wasting her money, but Philomel didn\u2019t know it was that much.After that, the nanny was kicked out after being beaten, but how was her head still intact even after acting so indecently on the subject of her sin? Unlike the maids imprisoned, confiscation of her property was the emperor\u2019s greatest generosity. But she was not satisfied with that and even protested.\u201cEven the princess should have seen it. The way she cried after being hit just once.\u201dThe maid giggled as she recreated the nanny\u2019s angst.\u201c\u2026You\u2019re talking too much in front of the princess.\u201d, said Countess Deles, frowning at her.She looked at Philomel\u2019s eyes. After all, the nanny had been in charge of raising her for a long time, so the Countess was worried that the princess would be heartbroken.\u201cI\u2019m fine. Maybe she reaped what she sowed.\u201dPhilomel reassured her with a soft smile. In any case, the nanny was no longer related to her.\u2018Huaam\u2019Philomel yawned, causing the Countess Delres to laugh a little.\u201cI will tell them to prepare your bed.\u201d\u201cThanks.\u201d\u201cWhat? This is my job.\u201dAs she laid down on her bed, drowsiness came over her. Philomel had not been able to sleep well in recent days as she had been trying to figure out how to get rid of her nanny and her maids. On the other hand, she was full of thoughts while she was studying. Whether she was summoned to the emperor and told her wish, or showed the state of her wardrobe to her new lady-in-waiting, was a ploy that came after fierce contemplation. It may not seem like a big deal to others, but that alone was exhausting for the nine-year-old body, Philomel.Anyway, I was very fortunate that things worked out as she thought.\u2018I hope it will continue like this.\u2019While praying, Philomel fell asleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 8": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/There Is No Place For FakesCH 8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter the obstructions of her side disappeared, Philomel\u2019s daily life went smoothly. The tight schedule, the eyes of others following her everywhere, and the fear of not knowing when she would die sometimes took her breath away, but she was able to endure it. Fortunately for her, the absence of her nanny and her old maids made her feel more at ease, and the Countess Deles and her new maids did their duty. But\u2026\u201cThis alone is not enough.\u201d, muttered Philomel.Before breakfast, she was alone in her room, turning over her bookshelves. It was good that the nanny and her crew were gone and she\u2019s slowly gaining recognition from others but it was too early for her to feel relieved, though.At least until she was old enough to escape alone, she should do all she could to survive. She was 9 years old now and couldn\u2019t do anything with her child\u2019s body, so the next few years would be difficult, but she had to be able to make a living when she left the imperial palace.\u2018I\u2019m splitting up my pocket money and collecting the escape funds step by step\u2026 What else can I do?\u2019How to get away? She had thought of that in her own way, but there was a big difficulty in keeping that plan alive. That\u2019s just scoring points from the emperor.There was an item that was perfect for escaping, but the problem was that it was the treasure of the imperial family. A treasure that could only be used by the emperor or a successor recognized by him.\u201cBut how to get points\u2026\u201dAlthough the Emperor has recently seen Philomel again,\u00a0 did not become dramatically close to her. She was occasionally invited to eat with him, but the relationship did not progress beyond that.\u2018Um\u2026 what should I do?\u2019However, there was no item that was worth giving up the imperial treasure.She habitually re-read <Princess Elencia> and doing so she lit up her eyes.\u201cYes, this is it!\u201dPhilomel immediately pulled the rope and summoned the Countess Deles, asking her to bring something. After a while, the countess brought a vial of green powder.\u201cIt\u2019s a powder made by grinding the mountain vinegar you mentioned.\u201d\u201cThank you!\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 But may I ask why you need the powdered mountain vinegar? It\u2019s usually used as a medicinal ingredient.\u201d\u201cI will brew tea with this and give it to His Majesty.\u201d\u201c\u2026His Majesty?\u201d\u201cYeah! His Majesty enjoys drinking often. I read in a book that water boiled with mountain vinegar is good for relieving a hangover!\u201dPhilomel deliberately spoke innocently like a naive child. From her experience, the countess was a good adult who wanted to protect her child\u2019s innocence.\u201cUm\u2026 that\u2019s right. His Majesty will surely be pleased with the princess\u2019 filial love.\u201dAs expected, the Countess blurred her expression for a moment, but she soon smiled and cheered Philomel.\u201cThen shall we prepare the teapot and cups as well?\u201d\u201cI want filter paper too!\u201d\u201cHuh, I\u2019ll bring it to you right away.\u201dAs soon as Countess Delles had left her room, Philomel opened the lid of her apothecary and put her nose close to it.\u201cAww, this smell!\u201dHer pungent sour smell made her vibrate. That was the reason why the Countess reacted ambiguously to Philomel\u2019s statement that she would give that in tea to the emperor. It was widely known that vinegar was good for hangovers, but few people enjoyed drinking vinegar tea the day after heavy drinking. It was because of the terrible smell and the taste that was twice as terrible as the smell.\u2018But with this, it\u2019s okay.\u2019Philomel went to the safe in the back of the room, opened it, and pulled out a glass bottle the size of his forearm. The pale golden liquid that filled the bottle rippled. It was the juice of the fruit of the World Tree. It was said that if you add world tree juice to mountain vinegar herb tea, it surprisingly neutralizes the bitterness and makes it edible. In her book, it was a fact that Ellensia accidentally discovered while adding the juice of the World Tree fruit she received from her father to the mountain herb tea.Such an amazing coincidence came from the simple idea of \u2018mixing good things with good things will make you more healthy.\u2019\u2018As expected, the real princess is a different entity no matter what.\u2019Philomel smiled bitterly. Anyway, that\u2019s how Ellencia created a so-called \u2018special vinegar tea\u2019 that was more excellent at relieving hangovers than just vinegar tea and helps to recover. Until then, no one had even dared to put the juice of the precious World Tree fruit into a terrible tea. In other words, Ellencia was the first inventor of the \u2018special vinegar tea\u2019. Of course, Philomel would intercept it.\u2018Sorry! Ellencia. You\u2019ll eat well and live well without it anyway, so give it to me.\u2019After asking for some kind of understanding inwardly, the countess returned. Philomel brewed her herb tea with the filter paper she had brought, then scooped out the golden liquid with her teaspoon. Proportion was important for best taste.Philomel added two sips with a teaspoon as per her book. Sweat formed on the back of her nose as she carefully stirred her teaspoon to mix the tea. \u201cdone!\u201d she tasted it, and it tasted strangely sweet.\u2018Ellencia, you may have given this precious tea to a knight suffering from a hangover because you have a kind heart, but I am different\u2019Good things should be given to those in power! Philomel followed the worldly logic she had awakened earlier and headed for the emperor\u2019s bedchamber. She said that her tea tray was dangerous because it was hot, and Countess Deles took it instead and followed her.Yesterday, she heard that the emperor had dinner with high-ranking nobles after a long time. The meal was said to have lasted until late at night, so there was a good chance he was suffering from a hangover that morning. But on her way to her bedroom, Philomel ran into Count Pollan.Count Pollan brought tears to his eyes as he listened to Philomel\u2019s explanation.\u201cFinally, the spirit of spring between the two of you\u2026! It\u2019s about time for His Majesty to wake up. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\u2018As expected, he hasn\u2019t woken up yet due to a hangover.\u2019Philomel rejoiced inwardly as she moved her steps toward the emperor\u2019s bedchamber. The bedroom door opened and the Count entered first.\u201cYour Majesty, look who\u2019s here!\u201dA voice drowned in agony came from somewhere on the bed.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s ringing, so don\u2019t shout.\u201dEustis, who was lying down, awoke from his booth sleep.\u2018This is the time!\u2019Philomel took her tea tray from the countess and moved closer to the bed.\u201cYour Majesty, how are you?\u201dPhilomel greeted him with the polite attitude she had practiced hard. Eustis jumped up in surprise at the unexpected female voice.\u201cPhilomel? Why are you here?\u201d\u201cI brought some hot tea to help your Majesty\u2019s health. Mountain vinegar tea, if you don\u2019t mind, have a drink.\u201dCount Pollan helped from behind.\u201cIt is said that Her Highness the Princess came to us herself. Isn\u2019t Her Highness\u2019 filial piety admirable?\u201dEustis looked down at the steaming cup with a sullen face. Perhaps because of the musty smell, his pale complexion became even worse. World tree fruit juice can control the taste of vinegar, but not the smell.\u2018I don\u2019t think that\u2019s why you don\u2019t drink, right?\u2019Worried about him, Philomel took it a step further.\u201cAlthough\u2026\u201dPhilomel\u2019s impression was momentarily frowned by the strong smell.\u2018He smells of alcohol!\u2019The emperor smelled of alcohol that could not be masked by the smell of wild grass. Philomel\u2019s eyes caught the table full of empty bottles. There\u2019s no way the attendants didn\u2019t clean up what they drank before, so those must be the bottles they drank last night.\u2018Even after dinner, did you drink that much?\u201dSuddenly, her eyes widened.\u201cGet away from me.\u201dPerhaps reading Philomel\u2019s thoughts, Eustis hid the bottles behind him.\u201cBut\u2026\u201dPhilomel\u2019s hand holding the tray trembled.\u2018I can\u2019t do it anymore because it\u2019s heavy!\u2019The small child had held a tray with teapots and teacups for a long time.\u201c\u2026Give it to me.\u201dEustis sighed and took the tray and put it on the bed. As if having a snowball fight, he aimed for the tea water for a long time and then poured the tea cup at once.\u201c\u2026?\u201dThe brow, which had been heavily cracked, soon became smooth.\u201cThe taste\u2026 not bad.\u201dAt the result, Philomel smiled brightly as she had rehearsed.\u201cYes? The bitter taste disappeared when I tried the World Tree fruit juice!\u201d\u201cThe World Tree fruit juice?\u201d\u201cYeah! It was given to me by His Majesty.\u201d\u201c\u2026I gave it to you to eat it.\u201d\u201cI am no longer ill. But since His Majesty suffers from intoxication this often\u2026\u201dCount Pollan agreed.\u201cNow, for the sake of Her Highness, please cut down on your drinking. No matter how strong your Majesty is, drinking alcohol for ten years is bound to cause health problems.\u201d\u201cNoisy.\u201d\u201cYour Highness is still young\u2026\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s noisy.\u201dListening to the conversation between the two, Philomel learned something new.\u2018You\u2019ve been drinking a lot in the meantime.\u2019She didn\u2019t know because she didn\u2019t usually meet him.\u2018Besides, ten years ago\u2026\u2019It was around the time Philomel was born. It was also the year that Empress Isabella died\u2026 He must have lived drinking excessively after the empress died, drowning in her disappointment. It looked like he was fine on the outside, but on the inside he was a young man.Somehow she felt strange.\u2018It turned out that even her daughter was a fake when her wife died.\u2019Of course, Rommel shook her head vigorously.\u2018No, who do you sympathize with?\u2019He was the one who would kill her someday. So she shouldn\u2019t be weak-minded until she ran away.\u201cPhilomel.\u201dAt that moment, Eustis, who had put the cup on the tray, said in a low voice.\u201cThanks for clearing my head a bit. Please tell me if there is anything you want.\u201d\u2018Done!\u2019It was as Philomel expected. The emperor was a man with certain rewards and punishments, but she did a wonderful job that time too. She did, and he thought it would be a small item as a reward.What should she do?\u2018It\u2019s too early to ask for that item with just teeth\u2026\u2019Then. After thinking for a while, Philomel said what she wanted.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 9": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/There Is No Place For FakesCH 9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cAs expected, it\u2019s good that you made it here!\u201dLooking at the garden in full bloom, Philomel smiled contentedly. She was looking around the garden located in the backyard of the Imperial Palace. The flowers tended by the best gardeners were in full bloom.\u2018Such a beautiful scene always brings a smile\u2019.It was no exaggeration to say that even the worst enemies are stunned when walking in the garden, so beautiful was it.\u201cCould you take a walk with me?\u201dThe wish Philomel told Eustis was to take a walk. She had never taken a walk with him before.\u2018While taking a walk, I\u2019m letting him know how good of a person I am as a potential successor.\u2019However, the person who appeared in front of Philomel was not Eustis, but a completely different person. The boy, who looked two or three years younger than her, was looking at Philomel with his grumpy face.\u201cHey!\u201d, the boy yelled, \u201cThis is a place where only the imperial family can enter!\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dPhilomel calmly guessed the boy\u2019s identity. That was a garden that only the imperial family could enter. So, to enter the garden means to be a member of the collateral imperial family. And when she saw him with eyes of similar color to the imperial family, with his dull blond hair\u2026\u201cHow dare you ignore me? What kind of family are you? Don\u2019t you know that just sneaking in here is a felony?\u201dThe boy screamed, feeling that Philomel had ignored him.\u2018Oh, that\u2019s noisy. I don\u2019t think he can\u2019t be more of an idiot? Why don\u2019t you think I\u2019m a member of the royal family?\u2019Philomel tried to be patient with him so she said.\u201cHey, lower your voice. And you\u2019d better be polite\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201dSuddenly, the strings of her patience broke in her heart.Many people had secretly ignored Philomel, but this was the first time she had been treated with such an open insult. A cold, dry voice came out of her mouth.\u201cHey, you shut up.\u201d\u201cWhat, what? What did you just say\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAre your ears clogged? I want you to shut up. Liam Elos.\u201d\u201cYou, knowing who I am, dare to do that\u2026\u201d\u201cYou? Do you know who I am?\u201d\u201cHow do I know you?\u201dTwo figures appeared behind Liam as he shouted.\u201cLiam! What\u2019s wrong? Did you get hurt somewhere?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s noisy. What the hell is going on?\u201dThe first person to catch her eye was a woman with a parasol. She was characterized by light blonde hair and gray eyes. The person next to her was a boy who looked three or four years older than Philomel. The boy\u2019s hair was a dull gold, like Liam Elros\u2019s. The two were the Marquise of Elros and her eldest son, Logan Elros.The former name of Sylvia Elros, the Marquis of Elros, was Belerov. In other words, she was the former princess Sylvia, the daughter of the emperor and half-sister of the current emperor. All of the children of the former emperor died or went into exile except for the current emperor and the Marquis of Elros, who quickly sided with Eustis, so they were the only collateral blood relatives.\u2018I heard that the Marquis of Elros had two sons\u2026\u2019She knew the eldest son\u2019s face, but today was the first meeting with the second son. Since the Belerov family was not a friendly family, they rarely met each other outside of official occasions. Moreover, Liam Elos, the second son, was still young and had no chance to appear in public.The Marquis de Elros, who found Philomel, greeted her.\u201cOh, Philomel. It\u2019s been a while. How have you been?\u201dEven though she was an aunt, speaking casually to the princess was disrespectful. Ordinarily, even members of the same imperial family would set a certain level of respect for direct imperial family members. There are times when she let go of words, but it\u2019s a case where she was close or when she didn\u2019t give others her permission. Next to her, Liam, startled, asked her mother.\u201cYes? If it\u2019s Philomel, is it the princess? But my mother said that the princess looks ugly\u2026 Eup!\u201dThe Marquise hastily shut her son\u2019s mouth.\u201cWhat is he talking about? He must have been mistaken.\u201d\u2018\u2026 That\u2019s how you talk about me.\u2019Philo Mel\u2019s gaze grew cold on its own. Logan Elos stepped forward to divert Philomel\u2019s attention.\u201cPlease forgive my brother\u2019s rudeness with a big heart.\u201dLogan was more polite than his mother or his brother. However, as if he was lowering his upper body, he only nodded his head.Logan Elros. He was the boy many predicted to be the next emperor. That was because Philomel had no divine powers, and her other qualities were also lacking. The fortune tellers clamored that the emperor would soon adopt his nephew, who was reputed to be clever, and make him his successor.\u2018Even if Ellencia comes, she\u2019ll be a dog chasing chickens.\u2019Philomel snorted inwardly at him and bowed her head to accept her greeting.\u201cIf Her Highness allows it, we\u2019ll leave. I\u2019m here today to take a walk with my mother and brother.\u201dBut at that moment. Liam, pulling his mother\u2019s hand away, clung to his brother.\u201cBrother! Brother! Later, when my older brother becomes emperor, clear away this garden and turn it into a playground! I want to play war with my friends.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Shhh! Don\u2019t say things like that carelessly.\u201dShe heard it all. He already thought he would become the next emperor. Philomel was troubled as she watched the three people who were arrogant. Enmity against these three was dangerous considering the future. Even if they could be stamped out with the authority of the princess right now, they were the ones who would reveal their fangs later if Philomel was found to be fake. Maybe it would be wise to just laugh it off for now.\u2018But\u2026\u2019How could there be an heir to the throne who could not move even after hearing such an insult from a collateral family member? Some warning seemed necessary.\u2018If it gets into the emperor\u2019s ears, he might consider me a disappointment again.\u2019And most of all, she didn\u2019t want to live like that. Until she stepped down, she herself was a princess. Hardening her resolve, Philomel opened her mouth.\u201cWait a moment. Before the three of you leave, make sure to greet me properly.\u201dThe three hats looked at Philomel with puzzled expressions.\u201cI greeted you earlier.\u201d\u201cThe Marquise de Elros must have been greeted like that by the collateral royal family when she was the princess, right?\u201d\u201cThat, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd what was that nonsense you were talking about earlier? Speak straight up.\u201dAn exclamation such as huh, huh, came out of the mouth of the marquise. But there would be nothing to say. Because that\u2019s right.\u201cYes, do whatever you want. Sylvia Elros greets Her Highness Philomel. Are we done now?\u201dTo Sylvia, who lowered her head and shot her sharply, Philomel said one word, she said with strength.\u201cGet down.\u201d\u201cWhat, what!\u201d\u201cGet down. Isn\u2019t that a formal greeting for the heir to the throne?\u201dIn fact, it was rare for non-commoners or low-ranking nobles to receive such courteous treatment in a private setting.Sylvia\u2019s face burned red with shame. After her marriage, her status became marquise, but as a princess, she would have been treated as the highest among the nobles. Since the empress position was also vacant, the socialite was told that it was the world of the marquise. But the anger erupted elsewhere.\u201cMy older brother will become the emperor, what kind of successor are you!\u201dLiam screamed as if to help his mother.But at that moment.\u201cWhat a fuss.\u201dThe emperor appeared. The faces of the Marquis de Elros and Logan became contemplative. Liam, who was still young, seemed unaware of how dangerous the words he had just uttered were. To think that a collateral imperial family, not the emperor\u2019s children, would become the next emperor. It was a remark that could be considered a conspiracy.\u2018Maybe he hasn\u2019t heard Liam\u2019s words!\u2019Philomel quickly approached the emperor and opened her mouth.\u201cYour majesty! Liam Elros said his brother will be the next emperor. Is it really? Can Logan overtake me, the first princess, and become the next Emperor?\u201dEmbarrassed, the Marquise of Elros appealed with tears in her eyes.\u201cYour Majesty, no! My son never said anything like that!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe emperor said nothing.She believed that the Emperor would not forsake them, so Logan joined in as well.\u201cYou\u2019re right. Her Highness, the princess, heard it wrong.\u201dFinally the emperor said.\u201c\u2026So you\u2019re saying that the princess is lying?\u201dThe marquise froze, then she gave a strange smile.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but it is. Don\u2019t children often lie to get attention? But don\u2019t scold Her Highness too much. Children are like that.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. It was just a small lie.\u201dThe Marquise and Logan worked together to accuse Philomel of being a liar. A reliable successor should logically refute, but in an unexpected situation, the words to refute did not immediately come to mind. At times like that, she was infinitely sad that she was weak like a child.\u201cAh, no\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, Your Majesty.\u201dTears welled up in Philomel\u2019s eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He wiped the tears from her little cheeks with his hand.\u201cYou are not a liar.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201cIf you are a liar, then I am also a liar. I heard it too.\u201d\u201cYou-Your Majesty!\u201dIn an instant, the marquise\u2019s pretty face turned pale. Logan, who at least grasped the situation, fell flat.\u201c\u2026I have committed a mortal sin! I made such a mistake because I was worried about my immature brother!\u201d\u201cBro-brother?\u201dLiam took a step back.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Everyone says it. That His Majesty also marked my older brother as the successor\u2026\u201d\u201cNoisy!\u201dPuck!Logan hit his brother on the head.\u201cWhy is my brother hitting me? Wah\u2026\u201dLiam started crying bitterly. He was making a mess.\u201cYour Majesty, what my brother said is a lie. Neither I nor my parents ever said that to my brother.\u201d\u201cYeah, yes! My son is so imaginative that he must have mistaken imagination for reality.\u201dThe two people who called Philomel a liar now call Liam a liar. Liam\u2019s face was devastated when his trusted family betrayed him.\u201cStop.\u201dThe turmoil was finally stopped by the icy voice.\u201cI didn\u2019t pay too much attention to you until now. I would never have thought he was plotting a plot right in front of my eyes.\u201dEven though a warm wind was blowing, the temperature suddenly seemed to drop. He himself was so scary, what about them?\u201cThat, that, that\u2019s why\u2026\u201dThe Marquise of Elros trembled, unable to properly follow her words. Logan, who had been pretending to be smart, was white and silent as if his lips were sticking.\u201cSylvia, the reason I didn\u2019t touch you was because it wasn\u2019t worth getting my hands dirty.\u201d\u201cYu, Eustis\u2026\u201dThe Marquise of Elros sat down. The situation of former Princess Sylvia, who tried to appeal to her half-brother, was miserable.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to lose your head right here, take your children and leave. I don\u2019t want to see blood today either.\u201dJust like that, the three disappeared.After that, the title and property of the Marquis of Elros were confiscated, and Sylvia and her two sons were said to have been erased from the imperial register. Those whose names had been erased from the imperial family had to live like commoners, with their sacred powers sealed and kept under surveillance for the rest of their lives. It was a light punishment for being guilty of treason, but everyone knew that the Elros family hadn\u2019t really plotted treason, just because they couldn\u2019t control their son\u2019s mouth. According to what Philomel later found out, they were also nobles there, and they were ostracized by their neighbors for showing off their arrogance, so they couldn\u2019t get a bowl of soup. Well, that was only a later story, and for Philomel now, the evaluation of the man who had already walked far away was more important.\u2018\u2026I\u2019m scared.\u2019He was so cold-hearted even to her true blood relatives, so it was obvious how she would treat her fake daughter.Then the emperor looked back like a ghost.\u201cAre you not going to walk?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, yes?\u201d\u201cWalk. Let\u2019s do it?\u201dRight. Walk!She forgot because of the three hats. Philomel talked while she followed the emperor about how a model student she was, and how her teachers praised her. Eustis only gave short answers, such as \u2018yes\u2019, or \u2018not bad\u2019, but she thought it positively, saying that there were answered all the time.Philomel looked at him at the end of the walk and asked.\u201cYour Majesty, do you not like walking?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t particularly like it. But since I chased away the bugs that stray without knowing the subject, I guess I need to come out from time to time.\u201d\u2018If it\u2019s a bug, it must be the story of the marquise and her sons, right?\u2019Philomel carefully opened her mouth.\u201cThen can you take a walk with me from time to time?\u201d\u201c\u2026 go out?\u201d\u201cYeah!\u201d\u201cNot interesting.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine though.\u201dCould it be that \u2018not interesting\u2019 meant that something harmful would happen to her? Wouldn\u2019t that be \u2018not interesting\u2019\u2026? The emperor answered quietly, whether he knew Philomel\u2019s agony or not.\u201cI get it.\u201d\u201cWow!\u201dWait, that was not it. Philomel came to her senses and bowed her head respectfully.\u201cThank you for listening.\u201d\u201c\u2026you can do as usual.\u201d\u201cYes? I\u2019m sorry, but I didn\u2019t hear, so if you could say it one more time\u2026\u201d\u201cNo. Do what you like.\u201dEustis said nothing more and walked silently. Philomel obediently followed and looked at the beautiful garden.* * *From that day on, it became Philomel\u2019s daily routine to storm into the emperor\u2019s bedroom with \u2018premium mountain vinegar tea\u2019 the morning after the emperor drank too much. Count Pollan, who wanted to change the emperor\u2019s drinking habit, actively cooperated and provided information. Eustis glared at the Count and drank the vinegar tea each time. Then the two of them took a light walk in the garden.\u201cMy writing teacher says I\u2019m the smartest student she has ever taught!\u201d\u201cGood.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a compliment because I\u2019m a princess.\u201d\u201cIs that so? She was also my teacher, but she was not flattering.\u201d\u201cBut I didn\u2019t go that far\u2026 Uwaa!\u201dPhilomel, who often walked, stumbled because her foot was twisted.\u201cOugh\u2026It looked like her knee was bruised. She felt a tingling sensation as if her skin had peeled off, and she was involuntarily in tears.\u2018I can\u2019t be like this. I have to follow him quickly\u2026\u2019Otherwise, it was clear that the emperor would abandon her. Or he might look at her with pitiful eyes for crying over something like this.\u201cAre you okay?\u201dBut Eustis returned. He even asked if she was okay.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing!\u201dPhilomel hurriedly got up and walked with a slight limp. She stared at him and drew closer. After a while, Philomel\u2019s body floated into the air. Eustis grabbed Mel by her waist with her arms and lifted her up!\u201cYour, Your Majesty!\u201dBewildered, Philomel struggled.\u201cStay still.\u201d\u201cYeah, but\u2026!\u201d\u201cOnly the imperial family is allowed to enter this place, so there is no one else who can move you.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 His Majesty is having a hard time.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cEh? They\u2019ll see me as a dying corpse.\u201dEustis held Philomel around, found her most comfortable position, and continued the walk. Philomel found this situation stiflingly awkward for her, and squirmed at her elongated body.\u201cBe patient even if it makes you uncomfortable.\u201d\u2018How can you stand this!\u2019Even if it was physically uncomfortable because the arms were hard, it was painful mentally.\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, go to sleep.\u201dShe couldn\u2019t sleep peacefully. While thinking so, Philomel closed her eyes for the time being. And to her surprise\u2026 she really fell asleep.Upon discovering the emperor holding the sleeping princess in his arms, Countess Deles came running in surprise.\u201cOh, she must be tired. My, she always wakes up early on days like today when she visits His Majesty to bring him tea.\u201d\u201c\u2026Right.\u201dCountess Deles swallowed her saliva. She was well aware of how hard Philomel usually lived. It was only natural that she would want to do something for her when she saw her working hard with such a small body. Besides, judging from the expression on the emperor\u2019s face as he held his daughter, she seemed somehow to be alright.The Countess mustered up her courage and dared to speak.\u201cHer Majesty Isabella also liked the garden.\u201dShe loved to go for walks, she heard\u201cShe liked flower viewing.\u201dWhen the answer came back, the countess said delighted.\u201cIt seems that Her Highness the Princess resembles Her Majesty the Empress. Seeing that she gets up early every time to take a walk with His Majesty.\u201dHer blue eyes, recalling the past, were locked in memories.\u201cWhenever we went for a walk together, Isabella looked at the surrounding landscape. And I looked at the face of the person next to me.\u201dEustis looked down at her daughter.\u201cSo this child might not be Isabella, she might be more like me.\u201dAt that moment, an oriole perched on a nearby tree branch chirped. Because of her birdsong, Countess Deles could not hear the details of what the emperor was saying about the empress. However, she definitely heard his last words that the princess resembled him. To tell the truth, having watched the princess by her side for several months, she did not agree. However, it was clear that it was a positive sign for her father-daughter relationship.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was spending time with Nassar, who visited her as usual.Nassar asked at once.\u201cDoes Her Highness hate me by any chance?\u201dPhilomel, who was reading a book, looked in amazement at Nassar, who was sitting on the side opposite her.\u201cPardon? No way. I don\u2019t hate you.\u201dHowever, the boy\u2019s dark expression did not ease.\u201c\u2026Did you hear the conversation I had with my father that day?\u201dThe time Nassar was talking about was the day he came to visit with his father. And it was the day Philomel decided to let go of her heart for him.As Philomel fell silent, Nassar rose from his chair and knelt on her floor.\u201cI apologize.\u201d\u201cNassar! Get up!\u201dPhilomel, startled by his sudan action, stretched out her hand.\u201cNo. I will ask for your forgiveness until Her Highness feels better.\u201dBut Nassar resolutely did not lift his bowed head, so Philomel said cautiously.\u201cIt\u2019s not for Nassar to ask me for forgiveness. It\u2019s okay because he didn\u2019t curse at me behind my back, and I was not trying to listen to it on purpose. I just happened to hear it.\u201d\u201c\u2026Having that kind of heart is itself a problem.\u201d\u2018It was embarrassing.\u2019It wasn\u2019t that Philomel hated Nassar. Well, she, of course, was resentful of him at that time. However, as time passed, her resentment dissipated.\u201cHow is it? It\u2019s not like I can do what I want with my heart.\u201dPhilomel sincerely thought so. His love wasn\u2019t something she could have because she desperately wanted it, and if he couldn\u2019t love her, it wasn\u2019t his fault either.But Nassar did not agree.\u201cI have to control even my heart. So, it is my fault for harboring evil intentions.\u201dPhilomel felt a little bit sad for Nassar.\u2018I wonder how strict the Duke is with his son.\u2019The Duchy of Avridon was famous for educating his sons very harshly. If it\u2019s academic, it\u2019s academic, if it\u2019s swordsmanship, it\u2019s swordsmanship. It seemed that the Duke was even more enthusiastic because he was Nassar, who could do anything if he was asked to do so.As Philomel herself took the successor training in earnest, she came to understand, at least a little, what Nassar\u2019s struggles were.The shoulders of Nassar, who was kneeling in front of her, seemed unusually small to her.The crying boy begged.\u201cAside from that, if there is anything you don\u2019t like, please let me know. Since I was born to serve Her Highness, I will fix it if you tell me.\u201dPhilomel couldn\u2019t hold back any longer.\u201cWhy was Nassar born to serve me? Nassar is just Nasar!\u201d\u201cBut my father says I must always serve Her Highness with that mindset\u2026\u201dApparently, that young boy had been trained to be the princess\u2019 mate from a very long time ago. Even at the level of brainwashing.\u2018Peacock! What have you done to your son!\u2019Philomel held her forehead.\u2018If you hang on to me like this and later find out that I\u2019m not the princess, aren\u2019t you blaming me for nothing?\u2019After all, Nassar cannot be left in that state.\u201cNassar, sit here.\u201dWhen Philomel spoke resolutely, the stunned boy obediently followed.\u201cFollow me.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cJust repeat what I say once.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201d\u201cI am a valuable person.\u201dNassar hesitantly repeated.\u201c\u2026I am a valuable person.\u201d\u201cI was not born for someone else\u2019s sake.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I was not born for someone else\u2019s sake.\u201d\u201cI will live as I want.\u201d\u201cI will live\u2026\u201dThe boy\u2019s voice, which seemed to have died down, burst out after a while.\u201cI\u2019ll live as I please.\u201dHe was the heir to the duchy and would eventually marry the princess, Ellencia, but Philomel still wanted him to live his own life.\u201cIt was just great. Let\u2019s just do it like this.\u201d\u201cYeah!\u201dThe brainwashing process continued for a while, and even Philomel questioned if it would be effective.After the promised time passed, it was time for Nassar to return.\u201cThen, Your Highness\u2026 I\u2019ll leave now.\u201dNassar hesitantly said goodbye. But somehow, it seemed that he didn\u2019t really want to go back.\u2018Isn\u2019t the Duke ordering this and that as soon as he leaves?\u2019Feeling sorry for him acting like an uneaten puppy, Philomel stopped Nassar from leaving.\u201cNassar. Have dinner with me tonight.\u201d\u201c\u2026 may I?\u201d\u201cSure. I\u2019ll tell the Duke. And Nassar.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cFrom now on, if the Duke tells you to do something you don\u2019t want to do over and over and over and over again\u2026 Just ignore it.\u201d\u201c\u2026I will try.\u201d\u201cIf he tries to tell you that nonsense again, tell me. I\u2019ll punish the Duke.\u201dNassar laughed as if he thought it was a joke.\u201cI\u2019m not kidding. I can really scold a Duke.\u201dAt least as long as the Duke recognized Philomel as the princess.That day, Nassar had supper and chatted with Philomel before returning home. Nassar shyly confessed that he wanted to become a warrior instead of a duke. Although the duke would never let his precious only son slay monsters, Philomel cheered eagerly.It was at that time that she learned about the boy \u2018Nassar\u2019, who was not the male protagonist in the book, not the heir of Avrydon.\u2018Yes. This is enough.\u2019As Nassar waved his hand and left, Philomel thought that even if she didn\u2019t have to be close to Nassar any more than necessary, she didn\u2019t even bother to stick around.\u201cI\u2019ll just have to stay like this.\u201dEverything was peaceful.* * *The night Nassar returned, Philomel approached the stove where the fire was burning, holding <Princess Ellencia>.\u201cBecause I memorized everything\u2026\u201dMeanwhile, Philomel read, read, and read that book. Just in case, she changed the important information to a cryptic phrase and put it somewhere else. And not just in one place, but scattered all over the place. There was no need to risk taking possession of Princess Ellencia any longer. It was time to destroy the only evidence. That book was too dangerous. In the meantime, the existence of the book has not been noticed even by the maid who cleans the room, but there is no law that says so in the future.\u201cEh!\u201dPhilo Mel looked back and forth between the fire and the book, she hesitated, then, closing her eyes, she threw the book into the fire.The paper burned and turned to ash. But at that moment, the transformation happened. A beam of light spread across the floor right in front of the stove, and <Princess Ellencia> appeared. That too, with a fine appearance without a trace of soot.Philomel was so startled that he stared blankly at the book on the floor.* * *The next day, Philomel visited the Imperial Magic Research Institute located in the Magic Hall building.\u201cHere\u2019s tea.\u201d, said the sorcerer.The sorcerer, Humphrey, put down a cup of hot tea in front of the princess.\u201cI\u2019ll have a good drink.\u201d, she replied clearly.Wearing a dainty cape, in the presence of Philomel, he watched with delight as the young princess drank her tea. Humphrey was a wizard introduced to Philomel by Count Pollan when she told him she had a question about magic. He was originally a talented person at the Mage Tower, but he changed his job a while ago or something.\u201cYour Highness, so what are you curious about? I\u2019ll tell you as much as I know.\u201d\u201cI read it in a book, and I heard there is such a magic\u2026\u201dPhilomel poured out questions about this and that, deliberately citing magic in fairy tales that would be deceptive to children. It was a camouflage to hide the real question.\u201cThat seems like the author of the book exaggerated.Humphrey replied wholeheartedly. After some time had passed as they exchanged questions and answers, Philomel brought up the topic she was most curious about.\u201cAt times like this, it would be really nice to have a book that tells the future!\u201d\u201cAre you talking about a Prophecy?\u201d\u201cYes! Come to think of it, I\u2019ve only heard rumors about the book of prophecy, but does such a book actually exist?\u201dHumphrey rubbed his chin and chose his words carefully.\u201cYou can say it exists, and you can say it doesn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cWell, isn\u2019t what is commonly referred to as a prophetic book an accurate record of what will happen in the future?\u201d\u201cYes, it is.\u201d\u201cBut that\u2019s theoretically and practically impossible.\u201d\u2018Impossible?\u2019Philodel\u2019s expression naturally crumpled.\u201cYou look disappointed. It\u2019s true though. The future that wizards predict with magic is just a cross section of countless possibilities.\u201d\u201cWhat about priests?\u201dPhilomel couldn\u2019t let go of her lingering feelings and asked.\u201cThe priest\u2019s prophecy is the same. In fact, even the prophecy made by the high priest misses by about 30%. In fact, it is difficult to say that the remaining 70% were also completely correct.\u201d, he uttered enthusiastically.\u201cMost of the prophecies are things that can only be said with ambiguous words, and later, when plausible results come out, you can say that they have come true. If you put it on your ears, it\u2019s an earring, and if you put it on your nose, it\u2019s a nose ring. Based on the prophecy 10 years ago that the wrath of God would descend from the sky, wouldn\u2019t it be said that it foretold the shooting star that fell the other day? The temple is also needlessly conservative\u2026\u201d\u2018Oops.\u2019, Hamfrey covered his mouth with a cold face.\u201cOh, I never questioned the existence of God. When I talk about magic, I tend to go too far\u2026\u201d\u201cSo Humphrey means there is no such thing as a prophetic book?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Most of the books on the market that talk about prophecies are pure nonsense. Only a small part of them are books in which priests or wizards wrote down the possibilities they saw. How can you know the future with certainty if it\u2019s not God?\u201dBut Philomel already knew such a book.\u201cThen what is the book about?\u201dPhilomel pursed her lips.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A title referring to the owner of the Magic Tower. And he was also described as Philomel\u2019s biological father in <Princess Ellencia>.\u2018I can\u2019t imagine what kind of person he is because there is so little related information\u2026\u2019Humphrey said he had been in the Mage Tower until recently, so he must have known him well. However, Humphrey\u2019s hand holding the cup trembled mercilessly.\u201cWho\u2026?\u201dWho? \u2026The Lord of the Magic Tower.\u201cYeah. Lord of the Magic Tower.\u201d\u201cWhy is he\u2026?\u201d\u201cI wonder if even a great wizard like the Master of the Magic Tower can\u2019t accurately see the future \u2026\u201d\u2018But why are you reacting like this? As if I heard it even if I couldn\u2019t hear it\u2019Philomel tilted her head and went on.\u201cBy the way, who is the owner of the Magic Tower?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 he is a great wizard.\u201d\u201cI know that.\u201d\u201cAnd the Sage of the North.\u201d\u201cI know that too.\u201d\u201cAnd, and\u2026\u201dHumphrey suddenly grabbed his stomach.\u201cUgh, stomachache! I\u2019m sorry. Your Highness. I\u2019ll go back first.\u201d\u201cYeah? Oh, do it.\u201dSuddenly, Humphrey, still clutching his stomach, stepped out of the cage. Seeing his yellow face, saying that he had a stomach ache did not sound like a malingering disease.\u2018What is it\u2026??\u2019Left behind, Philomel drank tea and left the Madokan building without much income. After that, Philomel asked several court mages similar questions. However, it was all about the lack of nutritious information. Wizards sneered at the prophecies, and didn\u2019t know anything about the mage tower master or kept silent.\u2018As expected, I have no choice but to meet him in person.\u2019As she trudged along the road to the residence, Philomel made a promise. As soon as she ran away from her imperial palace, the first thing she planned to do was go see her father, who was said to be living in the tower. The greatest Mage Tower lord might know something about <Princess Ellensia>.\u2018And\u2026\u2019Philomel wondered what kind of man he was.Returning to the residence, Philomel first checked to see if the <Princess Ellensia> in her custody was safe. For now, it was best to keep it there.\u201cWhy did you come into my hands? Did you end up in my garden?\u201dOf course, no answer came back.With a sigh of hers, Philo Mel closed her gold torture chamber.* * *Time passed again and Philomel was twelve years old.Entering the Emperor\u2019s office, Philomel grabbed the edge of her dress and gently bowed to Eustis.\u201cYour Majesty, what a wonderful afternoon.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dEustis, who was sitting at the tea table, replied nonchalantly. Etiquette teacher praised her so that saliva dries up in her mouth, but Eustis did not show much reaction.Still, Philomel did not disappoint him. Originally, the emperor was stingy with kind words. Had she been his daughter, she would have been sad that she had been put in the same category as her peers, but now she wondered where she was.\u2018I\u2019m just glad I\u2019m not hated,\u2019 she thought.Today was tea time with Eustis, which happens once a week.Perhaps because of the count\u2019s nagging to cut down on his drinking, the emperor began to drink her tea often, but she took the opportunity and asked him to drink together, so somehow they stayed together.Philomel looked at Eustis, feeling the warmth of the teacup in her hand. Eustis was busy drinking tea, looking at the papers in his hand. Even the imperial palace, Ansalim, which the emperor had to take charge of because he did not remarry, was entirely his to deal with.\u201cAre you busy?\u201d\u201c\u2026not really.\u201d\u2018It looks like a lot just by looking at it.\u2019Philomel got bored, so she wiggled her legs one after another that didn\u2019t touch the floor and then, oops, she quit.\u2018I\u2019m not a kid anymore. I have to look dignified.\u2019Philomel, wanting to appear like a desirable heir with an advance interest in the Emperor\u2019s business, asked.\u201cMay I ask what kind of document it is?\u201d\u201cIt is related to the Founding International event that will take place some time later. The date of the event was set.\u201dThe answer that came out was suddenly cut off and an awkward silence passed.The founding festival was an unpleasant topic for Philomel. Even now, people often say that Philomel\u2019s behavior at the previous foundation festival was careless. As such, the foundation festival at the age of nine remained as the worst memory, so Philomel felt depressed even when she thought of the word \u2018end\u2019 until now.Tuk-tuk.A nervous sound came from the hard surface of the table where Eustis\u2019 index finger was tapping. Judging from the oddly nervous look, it seemed that the other side wasn\u2019t happy with this conversation either. Before the atmosphere got even weirder, Philomel said with a smile.\u201cWow, it\u2019s finally the founding festival! I can\u2019t wait to see what this event will be like!\u201d\u201c\u2026is that so?\u201d\u201cYeah! Shall we have fireworks this year? They were really pretty last year.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not in the plan, but I\u2019ll ask them to add it.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think you have to go that far\u2026 There\u2019s no need.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a boring event with nothing much to do.\u201d\u2018You must be joking. It\u2019s one of the three major anniversaries of the Empire.\u2019Philomel lightly continued, thinking that if the God Beleron heard it from the sky, he would be angry.\u201cAh, it\u2019s the founding day of the Belerov Empire. Of course it\u2019s important. Your Majesty always gives a commemorative speech on that day.\u201d\u201cI think the commemorative speech is the most annoying.\u201d\u201cI like the time of His Majesty\u2019s commemorative speech the most among the founding events.\u201dIt was finished as soon as possible among the prepared events. Philomel smiled bashfully, hiding her true feelings.\u201cIf I become the next emperor, I want to give a wonderful commemorative speech like Your Majesty.\u201dEustis\u2019 tired face straightened a little. It was the moment when Philomel\u2019s flattery skills, which she had honed over the years, shined. But maybe it\u2019s a law that people shouldn\u2019t say things they don\u2019t feel, flattery came back like a boomerang with an unexpected result.\u201cThen, will you try it this time?\u201d\u201cYes? What?\u201d\u201cIt is a memorial. There is no law that requires only the emperor to give a commemorative speech during the founding day. Even in the previous generation, the emperor and the crown prince each read commemorative speeches.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah? I-can I do something great like that?\u201d\u201cNothing. Just go out and say one or two words, it\u2019s okay even if you\u2026 or don\u2019t you want to?\u201dThe answer that a prepared successor would give in such a situation was decided.* * *\u201cLet\u2019s think positively! What\u2019s the point of a commemorative speech!\u201dWith paper and pen in front of her, Philomel made a strong decision.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t meant to be, but this is an opportunity.\u201dAs her relationship with the emperor improved, the courtiers who had ridiculed Philomel disappeared, but outside the palace, Philomel was still regarded as a spoiled princess. At a time like that, if she appeared at an international event and recited a wonderful speech, she would be accepted as the legitimate successor. And if she successfully completed that event\u2026\u2018I\u2019ll be able to ask the emperor for that item!\u2019Recalling \u2018that item\u2019 essential to escape, Philomel scribbled her commemorative words on a piece of paper all night long. And after a few days, the founding day arrived.Philomel trembled as she stood beneath the dais her emperor had ascended.\u2018There are too many people!\u2019The vast outdoor venue was packed with attendees. It was expected, but the thought of giving a speech in front of these people seemed more.Her heart pounded so hard that she couldn\u2019t even hear Eustis\u2019 speech. And Nassar, who was beside her, made a worried face.\u201cYour Highness, are you okay? Your complexion is not very good.\u201d\u201c\u2026Thank you for your concern. I was a little nervous, but no problem.\u201dPhilomel responded resolutely, befitting her princess act. Then her attendant approached and hinted.\u201cYour Highness. Now it is your turn to leave.\u201dBefore she knew it, Eustis\u2019 speech was over.She climbed onto the podium with a gait as stiff as Philomell\u2019s log. Because of her tension, her foot and arm on the same side went out at the same time. The attendant placed the loudspeaker in front of Philomel. A loudspeaker was a magical item with a loudspeaker stone attached to the end of a long stick. The loudspeaker resonated with nearby sounds, making any sound more pervasive.Philomel put her mouth in front of the amplifying stone and cleared her throat.\u201cDear Bell, Belerov Empire 9\u2026\u201dBut a problem arose. That\u2019s a very big problem. Philomel\u2019s voice did not grow louder. The amplification stone was broken and did not function properly.The attendant noticed, but he was equally flustered. There seemed to be no spare loudspeakers for Philomel\u2019s height.People groaned.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you speak?\u201d\u201cAs expected, it was unreasonable for Her Highness the Princess\u2026\u201dPhilomel\u2019s head was painted white at the unexpected difficulty.\u2018What to do, what to do, what to do?\u2019It was then. Philomel\u2019s vision suddenly increased. Eustis had embraced Philomel. Eustis adjusted the height so that Philomel could use his loudspeaker in place of the broken one. The eyes of those who witnessed the scene were stained with astonishment. It was an attitude that did not suit an emperor, and seemed too friendly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was worried that everything she had been working on had gone awry.Ever since he first held her in the garden two years ago, when Philomel\u2019s pace slowed down from time to time, the emperor hugged her. Maybe that became a habit, he still hugged her. She said back then that she was good and that he shouldn\u2019t have gone overboard.When Philomel said nothing, Eustis asked lowly, \u201cAren\u2019t you going to give a commemorative speech? If so, tell me. I will send you down.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah, no! I\u2019ll do it!\u201dIf she just goes down like this, she will only become a coward who gets really scared and runs away.\u2018I can\u2019t do that.\u2019Philomel put her mouth to her amplification stone and spoke over and over again of her commemorative address he had prepared.\u201cDear citizens of Belerov\u2019s empire, welcome here. Today is\u2026\u201dFortunately, she was not distracted by her shame, and her tension was relieved. That day, Philomel delivered her unshakable speech to everyone. And the attendees returned home with two things in great surprise. The first was that the princess, who was thought to be a troublemaker, has excellent public speaking skills that do not match her age. The second was that the emperor was looking at his daughter with a very gentle gaze. Their common opinion was that \u2018perhaps the previously drawn succession structure may change\u2019.On the same day, Philomel had dinner with the Emperor. To Philomel, who invited him to dine with her, the Emperor asked, \u201cWhat about the little prince of Abridon?\u201dWhen she replied that she had no appointment with Nasar, he said with a curious look on his face:\u201cDidn\u2019t you spend time with him every year on the anniversary of the founding?\u201d\u2018Did I? It certainly seems like that except when I was nine.\u2019But today there was something to be received from the emperor. \u201cToday, I want to eat with Your Majesty!\u201d Eustis said nothing more.Swallowing the meat in her mouth, Philomel opened her mouth.\u201cYour Majesty, how was my speech today?\u201d\u201cIt was good, you did a good job.\u201d\u2018Even if I thought about it, it wasn\u2019t bad.\u2019It\u2019s been three years since she had been working hard to become a recognized successor. It seemed like it could be said at this point. Philomel tried to put on a nice expression as much as possible.\u201cYour Majesty, there is actually something I want.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the red flame ring!\u201dSuddenly, Eustis\u2019 hand that was cutting the steak stopped.\u201cNo.\u201dPhilomel could not hide her disappointment at the sudden rejection.\u201cNo, that\u2019s\u2026\u201dA puzzled Eustis explained.\u201cIt\u2019s not that it doesn\u2019t work at all. It\u2019s still early for you.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t use it carelessly! I can use it well!\u201dPhilomel continued urgently.\u201cIt\u2019s not that kind of problem. The ring of prominence puts a strain on the user\u2019s body when he is young. You should at least wait after you become an adult.\u201d\u201cHa, but\u2026\u201dThe standard for adulthood in the Belerov Empire was eighteen. By the time Philomel reaches that age, it must have already been after Ellencia appeared.\u201cIt is too far. I can\u2019t wait until then.\u201dPhilomel continued with a trembling voice.Then, Eustis said, tightening his wrinkled brow.\u201cWhy do you want the ring of red flames so much?\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s because it\u2019s a symbol of the rightful heir to the throne.\u201dShe couldn\u2019t honestly say that it was to escape from him. Philomel gave the answer she had thought of beforehand.\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019ll give it to you when you become an adult. Tell me something different this time; I\u2019ll give you anything.\u201d\u201cI want the ring of red flame. If not, I don\u2019t need anything.\u201dConversation faded away due to unresolved differences of opinion. In the heavy flow of time, Philomel regretted it.\u2018I was impatient. Even if it doesn\u2019t work now, it won\u2019t work in the future if I insist like this\u2026\u2019When he said that he would give it to her only when she became an adult, she instantly became angry. The trust she had built up so far seemed to be eaten up by her childlike stubbornness. Before she left her seat after an uncomfortable meal, Philomel brushed off her idea.\u201cSorry. I won\u2019t force myself in the future. Good night.\u201dThen, because she bowed her head, she did not see the emperor\u2019s face.\u2018Ah, everything is annoying.\u2019Philomel was wasting her free time perched on her couch. Normally, she would have been thinking about what excuse she would have to go to get Eustis to stamp her eyes, but after the last meal she had lost all motivation. If she couldn\u2019t get the ring of red flames in time, she would have to completely revise her escape plan. She couldn\u2019t just let it go of her hands like this, but for now, she wanted to stay still without thinking about anything.Just then, Countess Deles approached, observing Mel with her pillow.\u201cMe\u2026 Her Highness the Princess.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cHis Majesty the Emperor is calling for you. It is said that Elita sent precious tea leaves as a gift.\u201dIt was the first time Eustis had called Philomel first without her sending a word to him.\u2018Well, I didn\u2019t have time to do that because I went to visit him without calling.\u2019She didn\u2019t know what to say, but when he called, she had to go.\u2018But\u2026\u2019Dump.Philomel\u2019s body stretched back.\u201cMy princess?\u201d\u201cTell His Majesty I\u2019m not feeling well.\u201d\u201cOh, where are you sick?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing serious. What can I say\u2026 I\u2019m just a little tired.\u201d\u201cAll right. Rest, Your Highness.\u201dEven after the countess had left, Philomel continued to play her late. By the way, the Countess Deles, who had left, returned. But it was not her alone.\u201cMajesty. His Majesty the Emperor is coming in person.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201dPhilomel jumped up from her couch in embarrassment.\u2018But I don\u2019t want to see your face right now\u2026\u2019\u201cPlease tell him I fell asleep.\u201d, said Philomel as she lay down with her face toward the back of the sofa. Then she pretended to be asleep.Countess Deles hesitated for a moment, looking at Philomel, who heard the sound of her going out the door. She knew it was a useless act. If the emperor visited, even if the other person was sleeping, they had to wake him up. She didn\u2019t wake up right away, and she even tell the countess to reject the emperor.She thought, \u2018I don\u2019t like that but\u2026\u2019After a while the door opened.Philomel, who thought the Countess had returned to wake her up, stopped breathing at the sound of a voice she heard.\u201cPhilomel.\u201dThe emperor spoke softly.\u201cI know you are not asleep.\u201d\u2018Ugh. what a ghost\u2019, Philomel flinched.She wondered if she should get up for a moment, but she decided to pretend to be asleep and didn\u2019t open her eyes.\u201c\u2026You don\u2019t want to face me now, do you?\u201dHis voice was deeper than usual. How come she didn\u2019t feel good?\u2018His Majesty must be very angry!\u2019At some point, she felt like she had to quit halfway and get up.\u201cI still don\u2019t know why you want that ring so much. There is no successor but you.\u201dThe sound of his footsteps came closer.\u201cBut\u2026 if you really want it.\u201dShe could feel Eutis coming all the way behind her. Something tickled in Philomel\u2019s head.\u201cThree years later. The year you turn fifteen, I will give you the ring of red flames then.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dPhilomel jumped up. Eutis removed his outstretched hand from her and nodded his head.\u201cYes. You won\u2019t be an adult yet, but at that point, it shouldn\u2019t be too much of a burden on your body. Still, it is better to use it as little as possible.\u201d\u201cThank your Majesty! It\u2019s the best!\u201dHa ha oh. Philomel was so moved by it that she hugged Eustis unconsciously.\u2018\u2026Oops. What am I doing right now?\u2019, Philomel quickly fell out of her arms before the emperor could say anything.He would hug Philomel when she needed it, but he never wanted to be hugged first. In fact, Eustis looked a bit surprised.\u201cWow! I\u2019m glad!\u201dWhen Philomel awkwardly raised her hands high, he didn\u2019t ask what she had just done.\u201cIs it that good?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d3 years. It was a long time, but compared to the first six years, three years was reduced by half.\u2018Besides, it was before Elencia appeared.\u2019Anyway, there was a limit to getting the ring right away and running away with the body of a child. She was glad she didn\u2019t get reported as an orphan.At 15, she was still not an adult, but she was not the only one who couldn\u2019t walk around alone. 3 years. If she waited 3 years, she could go outside.Philomel clenched her fists.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 14": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/There Is No Place For FakesCH 14Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTime passed and Philomel turned fourteen.She was about to make her debut. The debutante was usually given to young girls over the age of sixteen, but due to the vacancy of the empress position, Philomel had to take it rather early. Because it was needed for an adult of the imperial family to lead the social circle. That adult used to be the Marquise of Elros, the former princess, but after she was kicked out, there was no one who deserved the position. This was because among the remaining collateral imperial families, there was no person close enough to her direct line to replace the empress.Even though it was like that, she did not have to do anything big, but since there was no one to hold the center in the social world, the conflict between factions was sharp and the atmosphere was not good.\u2018Can I play the role??\u2019 She was reluctant to stand as Philomel, as if she had been burdened for nothing, but as a princess, she could not neglect her duties. Anyway, before Ellencia appeared, she was the princess.She thought, \u2018I have no choice but to fulfill my given role.\u2019Moreover, Countess Deles said it would not be too difficult. The wives would take notice of her if she was watching over Philomel. Although she was a temporary princess, she was a princess, and it was unknown how difficult it would be for nobles with high self-esteem.\u201cMy God! You are so beautiful!\u201dThe cheers of the Countess Deles burst out beside her, and Philomel realized the situation she was in. The debut date was today. The banquet would start in just a few hours. So Philomel turned back and forth to check her reflection in the mirror.\u201cWouldn\u2019t this be too flashy?\u201dLooking at the dress decorated with countless red ribbons over her white fabric, Philomel asked in embarrassment. The Countess shook her head and straightened the dress.\u201cNot at all! Your Highness has only been dressed very neatly.Her maids also helped her to get her ribbon undone. She checked carefully.\u201cThis dress may not suit your taste, but please bear with it for today. Everyone else is dressed up.\u201d\u201cUm, that\u2019s right.\u201dActually, it was Philomel\u2019s taste. Rather, the other dresses in her closet were clothes that were out of her own taste. Even before she was nine years old, Philomel had a taste for fancy dresses that would roll her eyes. Decorate as much as possible, materials of the highest quality. But it\u2019s only a matter of time before she becomes the extravagant \u2018Philomel\u2019 in the book, who keeps buying such dresses.Her face was not thick enough to spend the emperor\u2019s money. So Philomel changed her taste. She usually wore neat and elegant dresses, and she was thrifty as much as possible without spoiling the dignity of her royal family. As a result, others thought that her Philomel had naturally changed her taste as she got older. The Countess, who was regretful that she couldn\u2019t wear a cute and fancy dress, encouraged her to wear the dress she had chosen for her debut.\u2018It\u2019s a little bit\u2026\u2019 It was awkward but not bad.Philomel, looking at herself in her mirror, confirmed that the time had passed, and quickly left her room. The emperor was waiting in front of her carriage.\u201cYour majesty! Have you been waiting long?\u201d\u201cNot really. Rather\u2026\u201dEustis\u2019 gaze turned to the dress. Philomel was irritated at the thought of his eyes rebuking the price of the expensive dress, even though his personality wouldn\u2019t allow it.\u201cIs it very strange?\u201d\u201cNot. Goes well.\u201d\u201cHis Majesty, suit suits you very well.\u201dThe emperor laughed at the flattering words, climbed into his carriage, and held out his hand. From some time ago, he often smiled at Philomel.\u201cRide.\u201dIt was he who would escort Philomel today. Philomel held her hand without hesitation. Even on the grounds of the imperial palace, the carriage passed through the inner palace on the inner side and ran to the outer palace. While the Inner Palace was mainly the living space of the imperial family, the Outer Palace was where officials worked, palace attendants lived, and banquets were held. Soon they arrived at the banquet hall.\u201cThe Sun of the Great Empire and the Little Sun, His Majesty the Emperor and Her Highness the Princess are entering!\u201dWhen they appeared with the shouts of the servants, the attention of the hall was focused.\u201cGlory to Belerov!\u201d\u201cGlory to Belerov!\u201dPeople bowed down and put their right arm on their chest. And the debutante began.According to the general custom, the young nobles who participated in the debut dance danced with a member of the opposite age, accompanied by a family escort. At that time, there was a popular belief that marriage was done with the person who they danced with for the first time, and for that reason, finding a first dance partner was the greatest concern for the young ladies.Philomel heard that there was a young lady who ended up crying at the debut stage because she couldn\u2019t find a partner she liked. Of course, it\u2019s not a story that applies to those who have a certain partner.Philomel, who found her fianc\u00e9 far away, reported to the emperor.\u201cThen I will have my first dance with the heir of Avrydon.\u201dBut there was no answer coming back. Looking back in wonder, Eustis had a somewhat displeased face.\u201cYour majesty?\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s a superstition that you\u2019ll bond with your first dance partner. So don\u2019t be too entangled. There are still countless possibilities for you.\u201d\u2018I think you wanted to say something, but\u2026 Is this your own advice?\u2019Although she didn\u2019t know the possibility, she knew from long ago that she would not be connected with Nassar.\u201cEveryone knows. Don\u2019t worry.\u201dPhilomel gave a cool answer and proceeded toward Nassar, dealing with the people who were greeting her. Nassar was the heir who had both the literary and military skills of a noble family. In addition, he was praised as the best groom in the empire for his outstanding personality.He was watching Philomel approaching. He was very dazed, as if possessed by something, and Philomel called his name.\u201cNassar?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cNassar, are you not feeling well?\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m fine, I was just lost in thought.\u201d\u201cYou weren\u2019t too overbearing yesterday, were you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine. I had a good rest yesterday.\u201dThe Duke of Avrydon\u2019s passion for education never cooled. He recently brought in a sword master who uses auras as Nassar\u2019s swordsmanship teacher. Sympathy welled up in Philomel when she saw the bruises on his sleeves. One side of her heart was cold. It may have been the feelings of lament for the sick man.\u201cYour Highness, please give me your hand.\u201dWith a faint trembling voice, Nassar held out his hand.Participants were gathered around the banquet hall. The first thing to do was to wait for the princess and her fianc\u00e9 to start the dance.Philomel held his hand again without hesitation. Until she left this place, she was able to serve as Ellensia\u2019s substitute.* * *Time passed again. Philomel turned fifteen.\u201cGreetings, Little Sun of the Empire, His Highness Philomel Matias Belerov.\u201dAt a ballroom, a young lady with a nervous face greeted the princess.\u201cOh. Aren\u2019t you Lady Lusan? How is Countess Lusan\u2019s health these days? I wonder if the prescription of the doctor invited from abroad was effective.\u201dThe Countess\u2019s daughter, moved by the fact that the princess cared for the health of her mother even though she was not from a very powerful family, responded happily.\u201cShe has improved a lot. It is all thanks to Your Highness for helping me call a doctor.\u201d\u201cIt was nothing great. I was just a bridge in the middle.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re too humble. If Her Highness hadn\u2019t helped me, my mother would still be lying in bed.\u201dBefore long, several nobles flocked to Philomel\u2019s side. Those who were impatient to share a few words with the princess.Nassar Avrydon watched the scene from a distance, holding a crystal glass. Philomel was responding to every word they were talking about without showing any annoyance. Her soft brown hair swayed against her white skin every time she nodded a little. Nassar watched it quietly. Until someone did hit him on the shoulder.\u201cNassar! You were here.\u201d\u201cKenny.\u201dKenny Odelli, the second son of the Marquess of Odelli, was Nassar\u2019s best friend. He had a playful and chatty personality, but he was on the side of taciturn and had a lot in common with Nassar.\u201cWho are you looking at that way?\u201dKenny, seeing the direction Nassar\u2019s gaze was heading, blew his whistle.\u201cWhew. Very desperate, desperate. Do you want to see her again after watching her while dancing together earlier?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201d\u201cNo, then what?\u201dKenny slapped Nassar on the shoulder again.\u201cIs she so good? Enough to look at her all the time?\u201dNassar, who was silent for a moment, gave an answer that was somewhat different from Kenny\u2019s question.\u201c\u2026You danced with the princess too.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s me, I asked, and she answered. But you are the first dance partner.\u201d\u201cOf course it\u2019s because I\u2019m her fianc\u00e9.\u201d\u201cOhhh. That\u2019s all? You only danced because you were fianc\u00e9e?\u201dKenny looked at Nassar mischievously. As if to stop admitting it.\u201cYes. That\u2019s all.\u201d\u2018At least for her.\u2019Nassar swallowed his words and turned his gaze back to the princess.\u201cDo not lie. I can see the love dripping from your gaze.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKenny babbled at his friend who kept his mouth shut.\u201cLooking at this, I\u2019m jealous of this guy. Why did you get upset because the princess danced with other guys?\u201d\u201cNoisy.\u201d\u201cWell then, what are you worried about? You are the man who will have the honor of marrying her anyway.\u201d\u201c\u2026I wonder if that\u2019s the case.\u201dKenny clicked his tongue at his lack of confidence. The princess and Nassar were a perfect couple that everyone acknowledged, but his friend was always strangely defensive.\u201cWhat are you talking about? If not you who\u2026\u201dSuddenly, the murmur of words ceased, and the people in the hall bowed their heads. The emperor appeared.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Greetings from the sun of the Empire.\u201d\u201cThe protection of the sun god will be with his descendants forever\u2026\u201dThe emperor ignored all who greeted him and approached his daughter.\u201cYour Majesty, have you finished your business?\u201dPhilomel asked with a broad smile.\u201cYes. Let\u2019s go back now.\u201d The emperor, who was not interested in such a banquet, disappeared as soon as the ball began in earnest, as always.He must have had important conversations behind the scenes with several high-ranking nobles, including the Duke of Avrydon. In the meantime, it was up to the princess to deal with the many nobles in the venue. The princess, who had been following the emperor, turned around to say goodbye to the people they left behind.\u201cI hope you all have a good night.\u201dAn impeccably perfect greeting.Princess Philomel left the ballroom with an elegant and straight gait, as always. As she returned to the palace, her clear and quiet voice filled the emperor\u2019s carriage.\u201cThe Countess of Lusan\u2019s illness has been cured. Apparently, the treatment that was effective in Elita seems to have worked well this time as well. It seems that the epidemic is spreading to the southern part of the empire, which borders Elita, so shouldn\u2019t we supply the treatment medicine? \u201c\u201cRight. I will give instructions to those involved tomorrow.\u201dPhilomel selected and summarized what she had seen and heard while Eustis was away. From the social news that the late Marquis Nugu had a daughter, to the political and diplomatic rumors that the Countess Mo was planning to have a relationship with a foreign ambassador. The type of information varied. However, information that did not necessarily need to be heard by the emperor was excluded. If she didn\u2019t know if it was important, just briefly informed about it.It took a lot of effort to get used to this simple but difficult task. When she finished her prepared words, Eustis\u2019 deep blue eyes stared at Philomel.\u201cGood work.\u201dIt was always a compliment what followed.\u201cThank you.\u201dPhilomel also responded in a familiar way.In recent years, her relationship with Eustis has never been better. They often spent time together eating or drinking tea. Most of the time, it was requested from her side, but sometimes the emperor asked about the schedule first. Philomel always tried to be fair with a precarious feeling as if she was walking on a precipice. So far away so you don\u2019t forget, so close so you don\u2019t get intrusive.The limits were clear. There was no way Philomel, who was not his blood relative, could be a beloved daughter like Ellencia. She just tried hard enough to not die, and she became an acceptable child in her own way.\u201cCome to think of it, it\u2019s your birthday soon.\u201dShe didn\u2019t expect it, but Eustis spoke to her first. Perhaps Count Paul gave him a hint.\u201cIs there anything you would like to receive as a gift?\u201dThe time had finally come. She gulped at the question Philomel had been waiting for. It was time for her to put her long-established plan into action.Shouldn\u2019t she show that she\u2019s waited too long? She started by saying the words of the specification.\u201cIt is a gift. You don\u2019t have to take care of it every year. The ring you gave me last time is enough.\u201dPhilomel stretched out her right hand.The red jewel on her middle finger showed off its brilliant color. If one looked closely, it looked like a fire burning inside the jewel. An essential item for Philomel\u2019s escape plan was the Ring of Prominence. On the last birthday, Eustis gave Philomel the ring as promised.\u201cNot that.\u201dThe expected answer came back.\u201cIf you say so\u2026\u201dThere were words that welled up in her throat, but she deliberately held back.\u201cRather than what I want to receive, there is something I would like His Majesty to do.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cThat, at Yutina\u2019s villa\u2026\u201d\u201cYutina\u2019s separate palace? Come to think of it, you often visited it. Got it. I\u2019ll give it to you as a gift.\u201d\u201cNo! That\u2019s not it.\u201dThe impatient emperor stopped him before gifting her the real palace. What would she do if she received a huge gift like a royal palace? She couldn\u2019t even pick it up when it bounces.\u201cThen what?\u201dPhilomel paused for a beat before she opened her mouth shyly.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 I want to go on a spring outing to the royal palace with His Majesty this time.\u201d\u201cWith me\u2026?\u201dEustis\u2019s eyes widened slightly. She had asked for a meal and tea time together, but it was the first time she had asked for a few days outing together.\u201cIt\u2019s okay to refuse if you\u2019re busy! I can go alone.\u201dPhilomel\u2019s gaze was directed somewhere down.\u201cI just\u2026 the last time I went to the palace, the scenery was so beautiful that I wanted to show it to His Majesty someday.\u201dThe voice got smaller and smaller.\u201cComing to think of it, we\u2019ve never been on a trip together\u2026\u201dShe needed to create an atmosphere that was hard to refuse as much as possible.\u201c\u2026But, after all, it\u2019s impossible, right?\u201dThere was no certainty. Philomel\u2019s birthday was the anniversary of Empress Isabella\u2019s death in childbirth. As each year approached that time, the Emperor\u2019s mood rocked. Philomel\u2019s birthday present was always brought by Count Pollan instead. However, there was a possibility of consent. For some reason, these days he tried to play the role of a protector, and he wasn\u2019t the type to talk twice.\u2018Please say you\u2019re going! Say you\u2019re going!\u2019Her heart skipped a beat as she watched Eustis open his mouth.\u201c\u2026I didn\u2019t say it was impossible. I will go with you.\u201d\u201cReally? Thank you! I\u2019m very happy!\u201d\u201cIs it that good?\u201d\u201cAh. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dShe thought he was used to hiding her emotions, but she seemed excited as the end was near.\u201cYou have nothing to apologize for. But on that day, there was a scheduled government meeting.\u201dYes. A government meeting was scheduled for Philomel\u2019s birthday. Philomel, who had recently been involved in political affairs, albeit slightly, knew this.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You can go after the outing meeting. It\u2019s not like the scenery disappears if you go a day or two late.\u201dWhat mattered was not the date, but taking Eustis there. In the first place, she did not expect Eustis to go on an outing on his wife\u2019s death day.\u201cIf I do that, I won\u2019t be on your birthday.\u201d\u201cYes? Oh, that\u2019s right. But country affairs are more important than that\u2026\u201dEustis narrowed his eyes at Philomel\u2019s words.Did she say something wrong? Looking back at the contents of the conversation, there was nothing unusual. She didn\u2019t know about other agenda items, but diplomatic issues surrounding trade had to be discussed with the ministers as soon as an envoy arrived from Elita. It was said that the schedule of the meeting could not be advanced or postponed. So, of course, the procrastinator had to go out. Besides, even he would want to avoid his wife\u2019s death date\u2026\u201cThe government meeting will be held at the royal palace.\u201d\u201c\u2026.Pardon?\u201d\u201cI will ask Elita\u2019s envoy to come to Utina as well. If they come from the port, it will be the same.\u201dThe distance was different from each other\u2026 Why bother with such a thing?Philomel asked questions starting with the most questionable flaws..\u201cWhat will the ministers do?\u201dIt was not something that can be done only by changing the destination of the envoys or the emperor alone.\u201cOf course they should follow me.\u201dAs if asking why she was asking something obvious, he replied casually.\u201cAre you saying that ministers will follow you to Utina..?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u2018Oh my gosh. They\u2019re going to take me to the horde.\u2019There was no way the ministers would come without bags with their daughters since they were aristocrats. How many secretaries and servants to bring? A grand procession heading to Utina was drawn in her mind.\u2018Isn\u2019t it already an outing?\u2019\u201c\u2026Wouldn\u2019t that be too complicated?\u201d\u201cI only need to bring the ministers related to diplomacy. It\u2019s not that there aren\u2019t too many rooms in the villa, and it\u2019s enough to accommodate ministers and their attendants.\u201dShe had been visiting for several years and was well aware of the fact that Yutina\u2019s villa was unnecessarily huge. Philomel, whose head hurts, tried to refute a little more, but quit.Eutis said he would go to Yutina. Although the middle process was very absurd and irrational, there is no need to go against it.\u201cYes. Let\u2019s do so. It looks like this outing will be on a grand scale.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll send the flies right away after the meeting.\u201dUntil then\u2026 she had to live.\u201cThe more people congratulate you, the better.\u201dShe felt a little sympathy for the ministers who would follow them to the royal villa and would be treated as uninvited guests in order to not disturb her. But what could she do? The emperor they served was so selfish. Come to think of it, it seemed that the crowded side might be more helpful for the plan she had in mind.But why was Eustis stubbornly insisting on Philomel\u2019s birthday?She chose not to mind. She pretended his presence would be just a birthday present given to her. Philomel suppressed her feelings and turned her head away from the wagon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Welcome\u201d\u201cDid anything happen while I was gone?\u201d\u201cNothing. I have prepared the bath water for you.\u201d\u201cThank you. I\u2019ll just take off my clothes and go right in.\u201dThe maids helped take off the cramped dress.\u201cAre you going to bed after the bath?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to see that and sleep.\u201dShe pointed to the stack of papers on the desk. These were documents related to the imperial family\u2019s internal budget plan for the next month.\u201cDon\u2019t push yourself too hard.\u201dThe Countess looked anxiously.\u201cI\u2019m fine. It\u2019s just a lot of numbers, but it\u2019s not that difficult.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Are you sleeping well these days?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dPhilomel smiled flawlessly.The countess seemed to want to say something more, but she retreated when she was told to go and rest.Philomel bit off all the maids, washed, came out, dried herself, and changed into her pajamas.It was more comfortable to be alone, not having to wear a mask.My body was heavy, but I sat down at my desk to review the paperwork.The seat next to the Emperor was still vacant. Many women were still targeting the young Eustis, but none had succeeded in seducing him.Philomel took over some duties of the empress that had been in charge of the Emperor some time ago. After wrestling with the numbers for about an hour, my eyes became tight.\u201cDid I work too hard?\u201dPhilomel muttered as she leaned against the back of the chair and stretched out.As the Emperor\u2019s successor, she had a very important job, and she was dying to do the duties of the empress.\u2018In the novel, Philomel does nothing but spends money and lives.\u2019The Emperor and the imperial family were almost in a state of giving up on \u2018Philomel\u2019 because she was such a foolish princess. In other words, she is now an exemplary princess who is expected by everyone as she is in charge of many important responsibilities.\u2018Living like a rat is dead. I don\u2019t have to pay attention, I don\u2019t even know it\u2019s there.\u2019When I was alone, I remembered what I overheard six years ago when I went to check on the Emperor\u2019s sincerity.The first time I heard that I was going to live as he wanted. To be buried in a corner of the imperial palace and forgotten in everyone\u2019s memory.However, because I was doing various things for the escape plan, I came to live this hard.I was planning on doing my best in moderation so as not to get criticized, but \u2018moderately\u2019 as a successor was a pretty high goal. Philomel raised her arms and pulled herself together.\u201cI lived such a kind and diligent life, but even if it turned out to be fake, would I have to kill it? They might see you rot for a few years in prison.\u201dThe best thing would be to succeed in escaping and live without being caught for the rest of my life, but I had to prepare for any eventuality.There\u2019s not much left anyway.\u201cYou just have to hold on a little longer.\u201dPhilomel took out the key she always carried and opened the safe.There was a jewelry box, cash, and a book in the safe. I took out a book from them.On the outside, it was an ordinary foreign language dictionary, but when I opened it, the contents of <Princess Ellencia> caught my eye. It was camouflage, just in case.I read so much that the yellow paper fluttered over. I stopped at the page I read the most.It was the scene of Philomel\u2019s execution.\u2018I don\u2019t want to die\u2026 !\u2019When I wanted to give up everything since I was young, I opened this part and settled down.Lately, Philomel\u2019s mind has been very restless. When she thought of the future where she would be free after leaving this place, joy and loneliness came to her at the same time. It was so contradictory.The goal is to survive first, survive second, and survive third. Let\u2019s just think about that for now.Philomel sat in the dark room and gently stroked the paper.* * *A day before her birthday.They arrived at Utina with a group of people.Loved as a resort for generations of royalty.As much as she received, Utina boasted beautiful scenery. Among them, the best was Utina Lake, and the detached palace was also built near the lakeside.Philomel was crouching down and looking at the lake. trying to reach into the clear, deep water.\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous to go too close.\u201dA soft, low-pitched voice was heard.Philomel brushed off her skirt and stood up.\u201cAre you worried that I might drown?\u201d\u201cI apologize if I was worrying unnecessarily.\u201dAlthough only a year older than Philomel at the age of seventeen, Nassar, who had matured like an adult, bowed his head.The height you have to look up at, the platinum hair that\u2019s a bit darker, and even your sculptural appearance. Nassar, who was almost boyish, was more of a perfect male lead described in the novel.Moreover, now as a minor duke who helped his father led the ducal family, he was a permanent member of the political council.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I accept the Duke\u2019s concerns, so a lake tour is enough. More than that, do you have anything to say to me?\u201d\u201cWill you give me the honor of sharing a cup of tea with Your Highness?\u201d\u201cCoincidentally, I drank tea with His Majesty the Emperor earlier. It would be good for the Little Duke to find another opponent.\u201dPhilomel turned her gaze to the young ladies on the bridge in the distance. The eyes that had been watching this way were busy all at once. They were the daughters of the ministers who accompanied them on the outing.They wanted their daughters to have a strong relationship with the princess. The purpose was to be the maid of honor for Philomel, which was almost vacant.Philomel still had only one lady-in-waiting, Countess Deles. If it was a lady-in-waiting position for a princess who might become an emperor in the future, she would be coveted.However, the young ladies seemed to be more interested in the handsome little duke.\u201cNo. If Your Highness has already eaten, I\u2019m fine too.\u201dThe tips of Nassar\u2019s eyebrows went down.It was a beautifully sad impression. She would have been able to do anything for him when she liked him, but it didn\u2019t inspire much for Philomel today.He only feels sorry for not being able to fulfill his role as the princess\u2019 fianc\u00e9. Nassar always did what others expected him to do, so he must be sorry for his only flaw.Philomel wanted to tell him not to worry if he could.\u2018When Ellencia appears, you will be the perfect match for the princess.\u2019But I couldn\u2019t say that.\u201cThen I\u2019m done. The Duke, please enjoy the beautiful scenery.\u201d\u201c\u2026 The lake is really beautiful.\u201dHis voice caught the steps that were about to leave.\u201cI understand why the princess often visited this place. I think I will like this place deeply from today.\u201dPhilomel went on her way without looking back.There was not much evidence in the novel to infer the location of Ellencia\u2019s residence. Only the phrase that Ellencia frequently came to play at Utina Lake indicated that it was nearby.However, there are one or two rural villages nearby. It has been many years since Philomel pretended to visit Utina Lake and visited the village where Ellencia lived.Thanks to this, people around her knew that the princess had a special affection for Utina Lake.Even such misunderstandings will end tomorrow.It was because she had found Ellencia on her last visit.\u201cYour Majesty, did you call?\u201dIt was after dinner that the Emperor called.It is not common to be called at this time of day, so Philomel went to Eustis\u2019s room with a curious mind.\u201cSit here.\u201dEustis dressed comfortably and pointed to the front seat. There is a chocolate cake on the table.\u201cI even ate the dessert that came with the meal. Why cake?\u201dMoreover, it was a whole cake. I used to eat cake at tea time, but it was the first time that it came out as a whole rather than a piece.As Eustis picked up the cake knife himself, Philomele reached out her hand.\u201cI will do it.\u201d\u201cAll right. Now, listen.\u201d\u201cYes, thank you for the meal.\u201dPhilomel took her share of the cake on the plate.Why are you giving out a cake that\u2019s so uncomfortable to eat?He didn\u2019t say anything until Philomel sipped her tea and ate half the cake.An awkward hour passed as we only looked at each other\u2019s faces.\u2018It\u2019s uncomfortable!\u2019I couldn\u2019t read anything from the expressionless Emperor\u2019s face.Philomel was desperately looking for something to talk about.Years of experience have given me the ability to strike up a good conversation with this man. Politics, society, diplomacy, stories about the world, etc.They were topics that could be talked about without touching each other\u2019s deepest intentions.\u2018All right, let\u2019s say fabric woven from fairy wings is being smuggled through Shuburn.\u2019But before Philomel could speak, he held out something. It was an ebony box the size of an adult\u2019s palm.\u201cIt\u2019s your birthday present.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dOnly then did Philomel realize why the Emperor had called her.\u201cI was originally going to give it to you tomorrow\u2026 I might be busy tomorrow, so just take it now.\u201d\u201cThank you\u201dShe accepted the box in a dazed mood.Opening the box revealed a golden object.\u201cIs this a model ship\u2026 isn\u2019t it?\u201dPhilomel put a ship made of gold in her hand.The shape is as elaborate as a real ship, but overall it is very sophisticated and luxurious. It was even equipped with an awning to block out the sunlight, like a nobleman\u2019s boat.\u201cIt\u2019s miniature and the real thing is still in production. It took longer to produce than expected.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s real\u2026?\u201d\u201cA boat you can ride. When it is completed, it will be floated on Lake Utina, so feel free to come and ride it anytime.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes, thank you.\u201dPhilomel dazedly repeated the words of thanks she had just said.The first time, I got a present directly from the Emperor, and\u2026 I celebrated my birthday.\u201cIt\u2019s just a model, but unlike the real thing, you can decorate your room. After hearing reports that it wouldn\u2019t be finished until the ship left, Pollan recommended something like this. And\u2026\u201dOddly enough, Eustis was more talkative than Philomel today. It was always the opposite.\u201cYour birthday is tomorrow, but let me tell you in advance. Happy sixteenth birthday, Philomel.\u201dThe side face of the Emperor, who said that, seemed somewhat calm. It was a bit embarrassing, but it also seemed embarrassing.I felt strange. My stomach was boiling.Tomorrow is your daughter\u2019s birthday, not mine! My real birthday is today!My mouth was itching to shout right away.The words that couldn\u2019t come out of her mouth were scattered like bubbles, and Philomel just took the birthday cake to her mouth.The chocolate flavor of the birthday cake spreading in my mouth was sweet.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His face, which kept giving presents, flickered before her eyes.Did he not have the confidence to sincerely celebrate his wife\u2019s anniversary?\u201cIt\u2019s not my business. Never mind.\u201dPhilomel nervously crumpled the letter she was writing. She tore it up and threw it in the trash.What she was writing was her last letter to the Emperor. By the time Eustis sees this tomorrow, Philomel will be gone from here.The pen, which opened the beginning with the conventional word \u2018Dear,\u2019 got lost on the letter paper.Soon after that, I pressed the word \u2018Dear Father\u2019 with stroke after stroke.\u201cBecause it\u2019s the last time anyway\u2026\u201dPhilomel murmured as if to make an excuse.The next morning, an envoy from Elita arrived at the villa.The Emperor only showed his face when the envoys greeted him for the first time, and then disappeared. Compared to the past, when he didn\u2019t even come out of his room for a week after his wife\u2019s death, it was a huge improvement.Philomel, on behalf of the imperial family, attended the ceremony to welcome them and treat them to a meal.However, there was no order to enter the political meeting. On her birthday, it seemed to be Pollan\u2019s consideration.After the political meeting, Philomel\u2019s birthday party is held.The remaining time until the banquet is approximately four hours. Enough to finish the planned task.The young ladies approached and invited them to spend time together, but Philomel adamantly refused.\u201cCountess Deles. Shall we go out in a carriage?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine, but would it be okay if you didn\u2019t rest? There\u2019s a banquet in the evening.\u201d\u201cWe can come back soon. It\u2019s not easy to stay indoors in such nice weather.\u201d\u201cThe sun is beautiful today.\u201dShe climbed into the carriage with only Countess Deles, the escort, and the coachman. It was something that could not even be dreamed of in the imperial palace, but it was different in the detached palace, where everything was loose.Even the maids who offered to pack food for me because I wasn\u2019t going to be out for a long time refused.Where we were going, we told the coachman the name of the village. It was the village I stopped by on my last visit.\u201cThe princess really likes watching the lives of the people. After that, you\u2019ll want to become a saint.\u201dSaid Countess Deles, who was sitting on the other side of the carriage.She immediately believed Philomel\u2019s excuse to go to town.Of course, she also freaked out when Philomel first said she would look around the streets in ordinary clothes.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re going to go out on the street again this time\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, not today.\u201dPhilomel reassured the Countess and looked out the carriage window.A spring breeze mingled with the scent of flowers, and blew in through the slightly open window. The carriage rattled all the way through the winding road.After some time passed, the view of the small town began to appear.A story of a certain woman came to mind over the quiet scene.A foolish woman who, blinded by jealousy, swapped her child for the princess.It was the mother of Ellencia and Philomel, who lived in that village.* * *The birth mother\u2019s name, which I learned through <Princess Ellencia>, was Catherine Hounds.She was originally a close friend of Empress Isabella.Catherine and Isabella had the same hometown. Isabella was the daughter of a lord, and Catherine was the daughter of a wealthy merchant family.When Catherine was young, she met Isabella while following her father who delivered goods to the Lord\u2019s castle, and the two became friends.Despite the difference in status, the two shared a friendly friendship. I could get a glimpse of Isabella\u2019s free-spirited personality in the fact that she lived casually with commoners.However, with the advent of the young Emperor, the gap between the two began to widen.At that time, Eustis, who had just ascended the throne, was engaged in an active war of conquest.A ruthless, bloody tyrant with no mercy to be found. That was the general opinion of Eustis.Then, Eustis met Isabella at a country estate he visited for military stationing.The two quickly fell in love with fate.Eustis fell for a sweet woman, and Isabella also fell in love with a man who seemed lonely. Thus, the Emperor defeated all opposition and received the daughter of a foreign family as the empress of the empire.Catherine entered the imperial palace as Isabella\u2019s handmaid.It was all thanks to her friends that Catherine, who was only the daughter of a rural merchant despite being rich, was able to become a lady-in-waiting to an empress who was hardly noble.As a commoner, she became the empress\u2019 maid, so it would be nice if she could be satisfied with that, but Catherine harbored excessive greed. She came to want the Emperor\u2019s love.She also had the Emperor in her heart from the first meeting.\u201cJust being a mistress is fine. I want to be your woman.\u201dWhat returned to Catherine, who dared to convey her heart, was the anger and contempt of the man she loved.From the standpoint of Eustis, it would have been hard to tolerate because a friend of his wife betrayed his wife.Philomel couldn\u2019t understand what her real mother believed and did such a big thing as confessing.Looking at Eustis, who becomes a meek sheep in front of his wife, I can only guess that she may have overlooked his tyrannical side.The Emperor thought of his wife and spared Catherine\u2019s life. He was concerned about the shock his wife would receive when she found out about her friend\u2019s betrayal.Also, even if Isabella knew all of that, she wasn\u2019t the kind of person who wanted Catherine dead.\u201cDo not appear before us again. If not, I will kill you.\u201dIn the end, Catherine ran away from her hometown crying.Shortly thereafter, Isabella became pregnant and suffered from homesickness as the delivery date approached.Due to his wife\u2019s earnest desire to have a child in her hometown, Eustis reluctantly allowed her to return home.Sending the most competent doctors, magicians, and midwives of the empire, the emperor made a promise that he would come as soon as the due date approached.The first thing Isabella heard after returning to the palace-like lord\u2019s castle was that a friend she thought had gone far away was back in her hometown.Catherine was also pregnant.This is the part I am most curious about, but nowhere in the book is it written in detail about how Philomel\u2019s mother and father met.It was only written that she had a child because she came into contact with a certain magician.\u2018I guess it\u2019s okay since they\u2019re not the main character\u2019s parents.\u2019Anyway, back to the main point.Isabella, who had no idea what had happened between her husband and her friend, went to Catherine with joy.Isabella sincerely welcomed her friend, but a monster called jealousy roamed in Catherine\u2019s heart.Two people were pregnant at the same time but in opposite circumstances.Isabella, who gives birth to a child under everyone\u2019s extreme care, and Catherine, who had to give birth alone.Moreover, Catherine had not yet forgotten Eustis.It was a really heartbreaking story for Philomel. Because Philomel\u2019s real father was the owner of the Magic Tower.\u2018If I had been involved with such a great man, I would have thought about living a new life. Why can\u2019t you forget someone else\u2019s husband!\u2019Philomel let out a long sigh as she glared at the innocent landscape.\u2018Well, maybe there was a reason\u2026?\u201dThe biological father left behind the pregnant woman, and the biological mother could not abandon her attachment to another man. In other words, the two of them were likely just one-night stands from the beginning.Philomel comforted herself with the feeling of being depressed.It didn\u2019t matter if the real parents loved each other or not.The important thing was that Catherine had switched Ellencia and Philomel, putting herself in a precarious position.It was Catherine who gave birth first.The day after giving birth, Isabella went directly to Catherine\u2019s house to see her friend, despite everyone\u2019s disapproval.But then something happened.The empress felt sudden labor pains with several days left until her due date and almost passed out.Rather than forcefully moving the empress to the Lord\u2019s castle, the attendants decided to give birth there.Catherine had to get out of bed.After several hours of labor, the child was safely born, but Isabella, who lost too much blood during childbirth, became critically ill.Even so, many doctors and wizards couldn\u2019t save Isabella in the end. The moment the empress died.That moment when all the people present except for one closed their eyes to pray for the empress\u2019 rest.By chance or fate, Catherine was near the cradle where the two children lay.It was in an instant that she switched places between the two.Fortunately for Catherine, there was not much difference in appearance between the two newborn children. Back then, Philomel\u2019s hair color was closer to blonde.Furthermore, because Catherine did not take proper care of herself during pregnancy, Philomel, a premature baby, was about the same weight as Ellencia.Neither of them had yet opened their eyes, so the color of their eyes was even less known.Later, when all the people who followed the empress died, even those who knew the details of the birth disappeared.That\u2019s what Eustis did when he saw his wife\u2019s obituary in the capital.Amid the surrounding chaos, Catherine quietly left her hometown and moved to a secluded village. To live while raising Ellencia as her own daughter.\u201cYour Highness, Princess. We have arrived where you said.\u201dI suddenly came to my senses at the coachman\u2019s voice outside.When the sound of the horses\u2019 hooves stopped and the escort Martin opened the door, Philomel got out of the carriage.\u201cIf there is a house with a green roof on the hillside in this village, that is the only one.\u201dWhen Martin pointed his finger, she saw a small house.A two-story house with a green roof. Even the appearance of the hole in the roof being roughly patched up with a bore matched the description in the novel.\u201cFrom here on, the carriage can\u2019t go up, so I guess I\u2019ll have to go up myself. Shall I send someone to call the people who live in that house?\u201dMartin opened his mouth cautiously.\u201cI\u2019ll go myself.\u201dPhilomel shook her head.And when they\u2019re almost up the hill.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201dA small but clear voice was heard.Philomel turned very slowly in the direction of the voice.\u201cDo you have any business at my house?\u201dThe first thing that caught my eye was blonde hair, as pretty as sunlight. Next, the familiar blue eyes. Even the two reddish cheeks are reminiscent of peaches.Except for the color of her eyes, her face resembled that of Empress Isabella in portraits.It was Ellencia.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It is a rural village with nothing to see. Oh! Was it a useless question? Sorry!\u201dIt was lovely to see her being wary but unable to hide her curiosity. She was dressed as an ordinary mountain girl, but she had an unconcealed elegance.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Is that house yours?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes. This is the house where my mother and I live.\u201dUneasy, her long eyelashes move ceaselessly.Philomel asked politely.\u201cIf you will excuse me, may I take a look at the house? I happened to see it while passing by, and the house is really pretty.\u201d\u201cMy house? Compared to the lady\u2019s house, it would be shabby.\u201dShe knew that it was a ridiculous excuse.\u201cCan\u2019t I?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that I can\u2019t\u2026 I\u2019m a bit embarrassed. But if you want, of course, you have to show it. Come here.\u201dEllencia took the lead, probably deciding that there would be nothing good if she refused the request of a nobleman.\u201cMadam, please wait in the carriage.\u201dShe instructed Countess Deles, who was a short distance away.\u201cBut going alone\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be back soon.\u201dPhilomel overruled the countess\u2019 dissuade and followed Ellencia.\u201cMom! I\u2019m here!\u201dWhen I opened the front door, I could smell the food being cooked.Philomel slowly looked around the house.The furnishings were simple, but everything was there, and it was clean. It was an ordinary, cozy country house.\u201cHey! It\u2019s been a while since you left, why are you coming in now? You ran around like a colt again, didn\u2019t you? Why are you so\u2026\u201dThe woman came out of the kitchen, nagging and stopped.\u201cThere\u2019s someone I\u2019d like to introduce to you. The lady here said she would like to see our house\u2026 Mom? What\u2019s wrong?\u201dThe eyes of the woman who saw Philomel were stained with astonishment.\u201cAre you\u2026? \u201cThe woman asked in a trembling voice.\u201cHello, I was passing by and wanted to take a look at this house, so I asked your daughter.\u201d\u201cLooking at the house\u2026 please go back, I don\u2019t want to be a spectacle for noble people.\u201dShe turned away from Philomel.\u201cThen shall we talk about something else?\u201dPhilomel continued without changing the tone of her voice.\u201cDon\u2019t you know me?\u201dAs she took one step closer, the woman swallowed a shrill groan.The dark brown eyes of the woman looking at Philomel wavered aimlessly.Meanwhile, Philomel also observed the woman\u2019s appearance.The hair is dark brown. She had some wrinkles for her age, but she was beautiful. When she was young, she must have been a beauty with a slightly stubborn look.Her facial features resembled her own.That\u2019s what I thought, too.\u201cMom!\u201dEllencia supported the woman, who collapsed as her legs gave out.\u201cAre you okay? Where are you sick?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m okay. Don\u2019t shout because my head is ringing.\u201d\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be in bed?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine\u201dA mother-daughter relationship that looks good in every way. To them, Philomel was an uninvited guest.The woman shook off her daughter\u2019s arm and stood upright.Philomel said to Ellencia, who was at a distance.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but could you give us a minute? I need to talk to your mother.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cGo up there.\u201dAt her mother\u2019s determined tone, Ellencia hesitated and went up the stairs.As in the novel, Ellencia\u2019s room was upstairs, I thought to myself.There were only two people left in the living room. The woman fidgeted and opened and closed her fists.\u201cYou, you\u2026\u201d\u201cLet me introduce you. My name is Philomel. It\u2019s a name I took from an ephemera flower that blooms only here in Utina.\u201dEllencia went up, but Philomel spoke in a low voice, just in case.\u201cPhil, Philomel\u2026\u201dThe woman covered her mouth with both hands and sobbed.\u201cWhy, why did you come here? It is not a place for someone as precious as you to come. Go back to where you belong.\u201d\u201c\u2026 You know as well as I do there\u2019s no place for me.\u201dPhilomel calmly replied. She was a foolThe woman was blinded by her jealousy and changed the lives of the two children. She said that she didn\u2019t become an empress herself and that she made her daughter her empress, she wasn\u2019t even funny.Besides, if you decided to raise her as your daughter, you would raise her well.The person who tortured Ellencia while recalling the crime she had committed.However, the person who finally opened the door to the good child constantly approached me.It was a future that had yet to come, but she confided the secret of her birth to Ellencia one year later, the year her daughter turned 17.Even though she knew for sure what situation Philomel would find herself in if the real princess appeared in search of her real father.\u2018A heartless person. My mother.\u2019\u201cListen carefully, I will take your daughter to the Emperor.\u201dPhilomel spoke quietly but firmly.Catherine\u2019s pupils dilated.\u201c\u2026 Such! Such a thing!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m trying to get a father and daughter who have lived without knowing each other\u2019s existence to meet.\u201d\u201cNo!\u201dPhilomel looked coldly at the howling Catherine.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cEven if I didn\u2019t give birth to her, Ellen is my daughter!\u201dDaughter.Philomel was devastated.The lovely Ellencia is loved even by her non-blooded parents.\u201cWhether you are the real mother or not is for Ellencia to decide after knowing everything.\u201d\u201cNo! She\u2019s already my daughter! How did I raise Ellen alone\u2026 !\u201dCatherine started to weep.Philomele scoffed coldly.\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask until the end.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI guess you have no idea how I lived.\u201dOnly then did the woman shut her mouth tightly with a surprised expression.\u201cThat, that\u2019s\u2026! Of course, being in the luxury imperial palace\u2026\u201dLuxury? Have you lived your life justifying yourself with those words?\u201cJust as you don\u2019t care about me, I don\u2019t care about the life you\u2019ve lived.\u201dMy eyes were cold.Philomel\u2019s voice trembled slightly. She couldn\u2019t love that woman either. Just like she doesn\u2019t love herself.\u201cSo if you want to live, run away right now.\u201dThat was the only consideration she could give to the woman who gave birth to her.\u201cYou know better than anyone else that if the Emperor learns the truth, neither you nor I will be safe, right?\u201dIn the novel, Eustis finds and kills Catherine as soon as he learns the truth.Even Ellencia\u2019s plea to save the mother who raised her did not call for mercy from the Emperor.\u201cThen I will take Ellencia.\u201dA look of despair spread over Catherine\u2019s face. She seemed to realize that no matter what she did, she couldn\u2019t be stopped.Philomel passed Katrin and took Ellencia from the room.\u201cThere\u2019s a place you have to go with me.\u201dEllencia tilted her head at the brief explanation.\u201cMom?\u201d\u201cFollow her. It\u2019s not a bad thing, don\u2019t worry.\u201dCatherine, sitting on a chair at the table and bowing her head, said without looking at her daughter.Ellencia followed Philomel in bewilderment. It was, in effect, a farewell between her mother and daughter.The carriage returns to the annex palace like that.\u201cDo\u2026 Do you mind if I ask where you\u2019re going?\u201dEllencia wiggled her fingers in discomfort.\u201cWe are on our way to Lake Utina.\u201d\u201cAh! Lake Utina is a really beautiful place. I heard that there are many villas of aristocrats nearby, so the lady must have come to see them too.\u201dEven in this situation, she grew up being loved with a bright smile.\u201cSo, um\u2026 What\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Philomel.\u201dPhilomel did not mention a surname that would soon lose its meaning.\u201cMy name is Ellencia. Wait! Ellencia and Philomel are all flower names!\u201dEllencia and Philomel were the pride of the empire, as they were flowers that only grew wild near Lake Utina.\u201cWhat a strange coincidence!\u201d\u201cI know, right.\u201dIt\u2019s no coincidence.These were names that Isabella, who loved flowers, thought of giving her daughter when she was born.It was kind of funny to have two names, one real and one fake.\u201cCome to think of it, you have the same name as the princess. I heard that His Majesty, the Emperor, and the Princess also stopped by Utina\u2026\u201dHaving said that, Ellencia\u2019s expression darkened.\u201cCould you be the princess\u2026?\u201d\u201cWell, what do you think?\u201dEllencia, who was in tears at Philomel\u2019s cryptic attitude, looked at the countess as if seeking confirmation.But Countess Deles, who had lost her mind, did not notice the gaze.She was in that state from the moment she brought Ellencia and sat next to her. Ellencia seems to have realized who her face resembles.No one entered the imperial palace and did not know the face of the empress in the portrait.\u201cWhy are you taking me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t tell you right now. You\u2019ll find out soon.\u201d\u201c\u2026 yes\u201dAfter that, Ellencia did not open her mouth.A heavy silence fell inside the carriage. Philomel thought that Ellencia\u2019s face, as she closed her mouth, was as cool as any other people.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Did you enjoy your outing?\u201d\u201cYes. Where is His Majesty now?\u201dPhilomel nodded in greeting and asked.\u201cThe political meeting has been prolonged, and he is still at the conference hall. But she is\u2026?The attendant asked after seeing a commoner girl descending after the princess.\u201cThis is my guest. Ellencia, follow me.\u201dPhilomel replied lightly and quickly walked to the conference hall in the palace. She did it quickly, and she just wanted to leave this place.\u201cPrincess, wait a moment\u2026!\u201d\u201cThis way.\u201dEllencia\u2019s slow steps were frustrating, so I held her hand and led her.\u201cOh my goodness. Your Highness, are you back?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s have a cup of tea together\u2026\u201dI\u2019ve been talking to everyone I\u2019ve encountered. Normally, I would have answered one by one, but Philomel ignored everything and headed to the meeting hall.Among them, some who looked closely, at Ellencia\u2019s face hardened their expressions.\u201cYour Highness, the Princess! What are you doing?\u201dA knight guarding the meeting hall blocked the way.\u201cI need to see His Majesty right now.\u201d\u201cOh, the meeting isn\u2019t over yet.\u201d\u201cIt is urgent. Get out of the way.\u201dThe knight hesitantly turned toward the inside at the princess\u2019s sullen expression.\u201c\u2026 Your Majesty, Princess Philomel, asks to see you.\u201dThe answer came right away.\u201cCome in.\u201dInside were several ministers and the Emperor seated on the throne. Strange lines of sight followed the princess, who suddenly appeared.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? You wouldn\u2019t have come over for nothing\u2026\u201dAfter staying with Philomel, the Emperor\u2019s gaze naturally turned to the side and was nailed to the spot. So did the others.\u201cThere is someone I would like to introduce to Your Majesty.\u201dPhilomel pushed Ellencia forward, who was confused and did not know what to do.\u201cWe met by chance while visiting a nearby village. This girl\u2019s name is Ellencia.\u201dA murmur arose among the ministers.\u201cShe looks a lot like my late mother, right? I invited you to the royal villa because I wanted to show it to His Majesty.\u201dNo matter what Philomel kept talking about, Eustis\u2019 gaze never turned to Philomel.I understand, but I\u2019m a little saddened.* * *\u201cPhew.\u201dAs soon as she returned to her room, Philomel sat down on the floor. Her palms were sweaty as she remembered what she had just done.When Ellencia appeared, the meeting hall became quiet as if it had been hit by a bomb.Philomel pretended that\u00a0 Ellencia might be a relative of Isabella and brought her here, but it wasn\u2019t very convincing.The Emperor, who had to settle the situation, stared at Ellencia\u2019s face for a long time, but Pollan, who was worse than that, stopped the meeting. The ministers left the conference room, whispering among themselves.\u201cI\u2019ll arrange a seat elsewhere. Her Highness will go too.\u201dCount Pollan said that with a serious face.Philomel came out under the pretext of changing her clothes. By now, the father and daughter should be having a touching reunion in Eustis\u2019s room.It bothered me that Ellencia was thrown into an embarrassing environment without saying anything.But it won\u2019t be a problem. In the novel, Eustis recognizes at a glance that Ellencia is his daughter.A kind Eustis would be comforting for his daughter. I didn\u2019t want to reveal \u2018I\u2019m a fake\u2019 with my mouth.Philomel squeezed her trembling hands.There is no turning back now. I had to move forward.She quickly got up and took out the bundle she had hidden under the bed.Even the maids who packed Philomel\u2019s luggage didn\u2019t know what was in it.Since the princess warned them not to touch it, they could only guess that there might be valuables there.When I unpacked the bundle, I found casual clothes for commoners. It was a plain navy blue dress. Sometimes she mingled among the people and was the one who used to walk on the streets, so even when she bought these clothes, she didn\u2019t raise any suspicion.\u201cMay I help you change your clothes?\u201dCountess Deles asked from outside the room.\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s okay. I\u2019m thirstier than that. Could you bring me a glass of cold water with ice?\u201dPhilomel tried to answer in a calm voice.\u201cAll right, wait a minute, please.\u201dYou have to go to the kitchen to get some ice. It is a long distance from Philomel\u2019s residence to the kitchen, so it will take time for her to return.\u2018Countess Deles. Thank you for taking good care of me during this time. I probably won\u2019t forget it.\u2019Philomel ended her silent goodbye.I took off the dress roughly and put on the clothes I had prepared. The hair was tied in a ponytail and wrapped in a kerchief. Now, all that was left in the bundle was a pocket containing several gold coins and a book.<Princess Ellencia>.\u2018I don\u2019t want to be seen by others, so I have no choice but to bring it.\u2019Philomel took the letter out of the drawer and put it on the desk so that it could be seen. It was a letter I wrote last night.She hesitated as she was about to leave the room after checking her outfit in the mirror. A shiny object on the dresser caught my eye. It was a golden ship model received as a birthday present from the Emperor yesterday.Philomel raised her hand and brushed the surface of the smooth metal.You can\u2019t take it. The ring on your finger was a must-have item, but this is just a model.If you take it, you will be accused of running away with something of value. It is fitting to leave it here like any other valuable.\u2018Let\u2019s not be greedy. Originally, it wasn\u2019t even mine.\u2019Philomel put the model back in place and came out quietly.There was no one nearby.She passed the hallway carefully to avoid being noticed. With the appearance of Ellencia, a commotion arose, and they were busy talking about it.\u201cThe girl the princess brought, doesn\u2019t she look just like the empress?\u201d\u201cAre they related?\u201d\u201cNonsense. Looking at what she was wearing, they looked like commoners, but the Empress\u2019s relatives couldn\u2019t be commoners.\u201d\u201cMaybe a distant relative.\u201d\u201cDo distant relatives look so alike? I heard she resembles the empress more than the princess. Rather, the princess and the empress\u2026 \u201c\u201cShh! Watch your language. A mouse can disappear without even realizing it.\u201dEveryone expected it.Philomel slipped leisurely through them. Since they were out, nobles often went out to play, and the servants who served them were often dressed in street clothes.In addition, many outsiders were coming in and out because of the preparations for the birthday banquet. She was dressed plainly, so Philomel could only be seen as a maid.It was when I was half relieved that no one was paying close attention to the maid passing by.\u201c\u2026 Princess?\u201dNassar\u2019s voice from behind startled Philomel.\u201cAre you the princess?\u201dIf you turn around, you\u2019ll be seen.But even so, a single maid could not ignore the little duke.\u2018What do I do?\u2019My heart raced wildly.\u201cNassar. What\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201c\u2026 father.\u201dThen, unexpectedly, the Duke of Avrydon reached out for a helping hand.\u201cWhat are you doing standing still? Do you have any business with that maid?\u201dI felt the gaze of the Duke behind my back.\u201cNo. I think I was mistaken for a moment.\u201d\u201cOkay, you too. We have something to discuss, so hurry up and follow us.\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201dWhen the sound of their footsteps receded, Philomel moved her legs again.She came out of the building safely and arrived at the main gate of the palace. There were so many people coming in and going out that the gatekeepers seemed busy just checking who came in.\u201cI will control access when the banquet begins. Until then, come back!\u201dIt was all about shouting at those who were going out.Philomel got out of the villa safely without much difficulty.She went in a crowded direction and fell into a side road in the middle. And walked for a long time along the bumpy road.The figure of Utina\u2019s villa disappeared beyond sight. At this distance, even if you use divine power, Eustis in the palace would not be able to detect it.Philomel took the ring from her pocket and put it on her finger.The ring of red flame was an item that allowed people without divine power to use divine magic.On her birthday last year, Eustis imbued the ring with his divine power. So even Philomel, who had no divine power, could use the ring.One of the many magics that could be cast with a ring was movement magic. She pictured in her mind the place she would like to go to.\u2018Let\u2019s focus. Concentration.\u2019If the concentration is blurred, the body may be separated and moved. Philomel carefully rubbed the red jewel with her index finger. Immediately, the bright light from the jewels enveloped her body.It was a farewell.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was a name I didn\u2019t know. But I think I\u2019ve heard it too.\u2018It\u2019s not an uncommon name, but someone with a name like that\u2026 ?\u2019Pollan put aside his fading memories and glanced sideways at the Emperor\u2019s eyes.Eustis had been unable to look straight at the girl named Ellencia from earlier.The gaze is directed obliquely downward.It\u2019s not unreasonable. It\u2019s a little creepy that Isabella, who died, seems to have come back alive, but he\u2019s scared.When the Emperor couldn\u2019t get out of the grief of losing his wife, he wondered if there was a woman who miraculously resembled her.\u201cHey. You\u2019re the Emperor, aren\u2019t you?\u201dEllencia, who had been quiet, opened her mouth.It was admirable that she dared to speak to him first, even though she knew he was the Emperor.From the moment she first entered this place, the girl seemed bewildered, but she didn\u2019t seem intimidated.Her expression was also on the bright side, so it was amazing. It gradually faded as time went on, but that\u2019s all.\u201c\u2026 Yes.\u201dAfter some time, Eustis answered.\u201cThis may sound very arrogant, but\u2026\u201dThe two cute cheeks became even rosier.\u201cAre you my father?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dNot only Eustis but also Pollan were surprised to the point that their eyes popped out at the sudden remark.\u201cAs I already said, I didn\u2019t have a father, so my mother raised me alone. When I asked about my dad, she said he was a very nice person. You have dark hair and deep blue eyes like me\u2026\u201dThe girl looked up at Eustis with expectant eyes.\u201cIs Your Majesty my father by any chance?\u201dHowever, Eustis was silent at the bold question and suddenly turned his head.\u201cYour Majesty?\u201dThere was only a wall on the side Eustis was staring at.\u201cMy strength just\u2026 \u201cHe seemed to see somewhere beyond the wall.\u201cYour Majesty! It\u2019s a big deal!\u201dJust then, Countess Deles burst open the door, and entered. It was uncharacteristic of her always polite behavior.The knights stopping her also followed.\u201cMadam, what\u2019s going on\u2026\u201dThe distraught Countess cut off Pollan\u2019s words.\u201cPrincess Philomel\u2026\u201dShe cried out after taking a moment to catch her breath.\u201cThe princess has disappeared!\u201dEustis immediately burst into the room where the princess was staying. They were walking, but their pace was so fast that Pollan and Ellencia had to run after the Emperor.Countess Deles, exhausted from running to the Emperor\u2019s room, arrived last.Eustis, who was looking at the dark room where not a single ray of warmth remained, asked Countess Deles.\u201cWhat happened?\u201dPollan felt the emotions boiling in that short word. Here is what Countess Deles said, half-crying.When I returned with the ice water the princess had requested, no one was already in the room.I waited in the room, wondering where she had gone for a while, but the owner of the room did not come back for a long time.Anxious, she wandered around the room and found this letter on the desk.On the outside of the letter envelope, only \u2018Dear Father\u2019 was written.If the princess had a letter she wanted to deliver to the Emperor, she wouldn\u2019t have left it on the desk.She felt strange, but she couldn\u2019t bear to open the letter she had written to the Emperor and put it back.After leaving the room, she asked the maids outside the room for the whereabouts of the princess.No one knewShe searched for the princess with a few people, but couldn\u2019t find her anywhere.Then she ran to the Emperor and informed him of this fact.Pollan bit his lip. If the Countess\u2019 words were true, it was too late. Whether she was kidnapped or voluntarily disappeared, the probability of finding her was as much as the previous time was inversely proportional.Moreover, the princess had a ring of red flames. If used, the search range would expand to the entire continent.The Emperor picked up the letter from the desk as soon as the countess mentioned it.When the seal was opened, a piece of the letter came out. The straight and elegant handwriting was familiar to the eye.[Dear fatherFather, Ellencia is your biological daughter. On my last outing, I visited a nearby village and accidentally found Ellencia on the street. I inadvertently followed her because she looked so much like my mother and met Ellencia\u2019s mother.Her mother\u2019s name is Catherine Hounds.As you know, she was my mother\u2019s friend and maid of honor. Seeing my face, she cried and confessed everything to me.When my mother gave birth in her hometown, she was there, and she switched her child and the princess out of jealousy.Yes, I wasn\u2019t your biological daughter. I was the child of Catherine and a man whose name I don\u2019t know.Sorry to inform you now. I wanted to tell you right away, but I didn\u2019t know how to say it.The fake daughter is leaving because there is no way to see you. Thank you for raising me.I will repay the various favors I have received as the princess up to this point by doing things that will be of utmost help to the Belerov Empire.Please stay healthy and be happy with your daughter.\u2014 Philomel Dream]That was it.There was no indication of where she was going.Eustis\u2019 arm fell helplessly. The letter in his hand was crumpled.\u201cRelease the soldiers right now. Use all available personnel.\u201dThe voice was infinitely low. But when he said his last words, he exploded like a volcano.\u201cFind my daughter!\u201dPollan and the knights bowed down and obeyed, searching the whole continent for the princess.* * *At that time. Philomel was walking on a street crowded with people.\u201cA bag of bread baked today is only 2 bells! The shop is closing soon, it\u2019s a special discount!\u201d\u201cDid you see the new dress that came into Gina\u2019s dressing room? A transaction that copied the identity of the genius designer, Mrs. Margaret.\u201dThe market streets dyed in the glow of the sunset were full of life with people and merchants.She is now in Saint-Jen, a city in the northern part of the Empire. It was one of the five largest and most prosperous cities in the empire.If possible, she wanted to move to the destination at once with magic, but the ring of red flame could only move the user to a place he had been to.It was best to move to the closest area to Philomel, which had never been to that place.The destination is Angelium, a magical city located in the northernmost part of the empire. Crossing the border from Angelium and going a little further will bring you to the Magic Tower.There is that person in the Magic Tower.Archmage Le Guin, Philomel\u2019s father and owner of the Mage Tower.Her thoughts drove her crazy, and her arms tightened around her bundle.The first thing she wanted to do after leaving the imperial palace was to meet her biological father. On particularly sad nights, Philomel read <Princess Ellencia> and imagined her real parents who gave birth to her.What kind of people are they? What did he look like, how did they meet, and why did she give birth to Philomel?Her mother, Catherine, is Ellencia\u2019s adoptive mother, and since she appeared at the beginning of the novel, she knew a lot of information.A mean mother who mistreats the kind and pretty protagonist, Ellencia. However, in the end, being influenced by Ellencia, she repents her sins and confesses the secret of her birth.Then Ellencia meets Eustis and when everything is revealed, she pays for her sins by dying. However, her sins and self-reflection cause enormous damage to the life of her daughter, Philomel.Philomel grew up as a fake princess because of her mother\u2019s sins, and after a night of self-reflection, she fell from a princess to a criminal.As a result, her vague hopes naturally focused on her father, Le Guin.Compared to Catherine, little information was known about Le Guin, both in real life and in books.Even after asking Humphrey when she was young, Philomel continued to investigate in his way, but there was little information obtained.A geek who has great power but never goes public.In the book, when \u2018Philomel\u2019 is in danger of being executed for the first time, she runs away from prison and entrusts herself to her real father. That was the first mention of Le Guin.However, when \u2018Philomel\u2019, who couldn\u2019t abandon her jealousy of Ellencia, borrowed his power to commit evil, he also gave up on his daughter later.That was all there was to it in the book. Since the novel progresses from the point of view of Ellencia, the main character, only a brief description of how \u2018Philomel\u2019 lived in the Magic Tower is given.The description was close to \u2018the villain who was thought to have been defeated, persisted and committed evil again\u2019.The father also felt that the villain \u2018Philomel\u2019 was a new weapon.\u2018Since nothing is known like this, I have no choice but to go and check it myself.\u2019Anyway, since Le Guin made an effort to protect \u2018Philomel\u2019, he might have some affection for his daughter.Philomel thought as she moved her gaze toward the border.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You must move as quickly as possible. She did not know when a search order would fall on her, and the divine power contained in the ring was limited.It would be nice if the Emperor would turn a blind eye to Philomel running away with the affection he had accumulated over the years.\u201c\u2026isn\u2019t that impossible?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no limit to what we can do!\u201dI was surprised when I heard the answer to my small voice.\u201cCome in and have a look. If you have a hat that suits you, I\u2019ll give you a lot of discounts! \u201cThe clerk at the hat store was in the middle of soliciting customers.\u2018Pretty? Did you recognize my face?\u2019Unknowingly, my hand went to the ring.Philomel was currently using one of the magics of the ring, the magic of erasing the presence.It left a vague impression on others, so even if they tried to remember Philomel later, it was difficult to remember clearly.\u201cLook at the pretty sister over there!\u201dA middle-aged woman who passed by at the clerk\u2019s cheeky smile entered the store.It was a word to all the women nearby. Thank God there\u2019s no magic problem.\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s a hat shop.\u201dInside the show window, I could see hats decorated with colorful feathers and artificial flowers.I couldn\u2019t afford to shop. I had to find out the transportation to Angelium and the accommodation to stay today. But\u2026\u201cI do need a hat to cover my face. The headscarf is a bit tacky. \u201cPhilomel excused herself and entered the store.The expression of excitement was not hidden. For the first time in her life, she was experiencing a great sense of release.* * *\u201cCount Pollan.\u201d\u201cThe Duke of the Avrydon.\u201dPollan, who was walking fast, was called by Nassar to stop him.\u201cHave you received any new information?\u201dNassar\u2019s expression darkened as Pollan shook his head.It\u2019s already been a week since Princess Philomel disappeared. The fate of the princess was still unknown.The Emperor, who had no wish to leave Utina, came back to the capital, but there was no such gain in the capital.Three days ago, he gave up the secret search and announced the news of the princess\u2019s disappearance across the country.The whole country was shocked to hear that the only princess had gone missing.Even though the princess\u2019s description was spread all over the country and a huge reward was offered, not a single hair came out.Even after hearing the report that they had seen the princess, it was just a resemblance, or it was the informant\u2019s misunderstanding.\u201cWhere the hell is she? I need to find her as soon as possible.\u201dNassar said with a worried expression. Since he was the princess\u2019 fianc\u00e9, he wouldn\u2019t be lying, either.Nassar\u2019s eyes when he came to Pollan and asked him to share the information were not forgotten.There was so much desperation that I couldn\u2019t even think of a little duke who was always upright in everything.These days, he was living a life where he frequently went back and forth between the place where the princess was seen and the capital. Even leading the Duke\u2019s knights.\u201cI know how you feel, but take care of your body. What if you fell\u2026\u201cHas anyone fallen?\u201dI said things I shouldn\u2019t have said.Nassar\u2019s expression darkened as Pollan shook his head.\u201cI-I think I\u2019m about to collapse, because I have a lot of work.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s right. The Count must be having a hard time too.\u201dFortunately, Nassar didn\u2019t seem to mind Pollan\u2019s excuses.\u201cI\u2019m going to leave. Any information is fine, so please let me know when the information comes in.\u201d\u201cAre you going somewhere new again?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m going to Saint-Gen.\u201d\u201cWhy Saint-Gen?\u201d\u201cThey said that the ring of red flame only transports you to places you\u2019ve been to before. The other day, I visited with the princess before. It\u2019s just a guess, but\u2026 She may have been there.\u201dNassar quickly moved away.\u201cI must be tired too, after making all these mistakes\u2026\u201dPollan sighed as he walked down the road to the Emperor\u2019s office.A search is a search, but other things have also been a headache.Rumors quickly spread that the girl who appeared in the villa and resembled the empress was the real princess and that Princess Philomel was a fake.Every person I met secretly talked about rumors. Even if he dismissed it as a groundless rumor, everyone seemed convinced.Something was strange.Rumors spread too fast. Now, even ordinary people complained that the princess was ruined when they found out that she was a fake.I tried to calm the rumors as much as possible, but the portrait of Philomel on the street was regarded as a wanted letter.To be honest, even Pollan had no idea if all the rumors were true. However, he was certain that the Emperor had not ordered the princess to seek her out to punish her.What monarch in the world would go so far as to faint to find a criminal to punish?Even now, when I think about it, my heart skips a beat. When Eustis was lying on the floor of his office.\u201cYour Majesty! Are you all right?\u201c\u2026noisy.\u201dHe soon came to my senses with Pollan\u2019s shouts, but it was a dizzying moment.The cause of his collapse was the excessive use of divine power.It is said that to detect the divine power emitted by the ring of red flame, the sacred power was stretched thinly and spread like a spider\u2019s web.I don\u2019t know how far you think the princess is willing to go and use such an ignorant method.It was the first time I had seen Eustis pushed to such a limit after his wife\u2019s death. It was only natural that his daughter had disappeared before the shock of encountering a girl who looked just like his wife had gone.Moreover, Princess Philomel, whom he had only thought of as his real daughter, was a fake.After thinking about this and that, I arrived in front of the office.I heard conversations inside. A cute voice that speaks loudly. Ellencia?Returning from Utina to the capital, they couldn\u2019t leave a girl who might be the princess behind, so they brought Ellencia.The Emperor had several meetings to confirm the girl\u2019s authenticity, but he was not convinced.\u201cYour Majesty, this is Pollan. Can I come in?\u201d\u201c\u2026 come in.\u201dIn the office were Eustis, Ellencia, and an elderly lady. She was the one who was kicked out after being the princess\u2019s nanny a long time ago.\u201cOh! Your Majesty, this is Isabella\u2019s daughter, for sure! She looks just like the little girl.\u201dThe nanny, with tears in her eyes, hugged Ellencia tightly.Ellencia was summoned here to see if she is the daughter of Empress Isabella.The empress\u2019s parents had passed away a long time ago, and the fate of one sister was unknown. So the nanny was the only one who remembered the empress\u2019 childhood.Ellencia blinked and asked.\u201cAm I the daughter of His Majesty, the Emperor, and the Empress?\u201d\u201cOf course! Who else is their daughter?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so happy! I can\u2019t believe I found my dad!\u201dEllencia and Nanny hugged each other and smiled brightly.In contrast, Eustis, who was sitting a little further away, opened his mouth with a complicated expression.\u201cThe year you quit your job was the year Philomel turned nine.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201dAre you uncomfortable with the topic of Philomel?The nanny answered shyly.\u201cYou\u2019ve taken care of Philomel since she was a baby. A total of nine years. You took care of her.\u201d\u201cIt is.\u201dEustis smiled. With a face that doesn\u2019t look happy at all.\u201cBut you accept it very quickly. I still\u2026 I can\u2019t believe my daughter isn\u2019t my daughter.\u201dThe atmosphere grew quiet.When everyone was only looking at the Emperor, the knights came in.\u201cYour Majesty. I caught the woman, you said. She was spotted by an inspector trying to cross the adjacent border gate in Utina.\u201dA brown-haired woman with her arms tied with ropes was thrown to the floor.\u201cMom!\u201dEllencia rushed after confirming the woman\u2019s face.\u201cMom, are you okay?\u201dPollan soon remembered who the woman was.\u201cCatherine Hounds.\u201dEustis rose from his seat and approached the woman.\u201cIt was you\u201dThe flowing life strained the people who were there.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dThe face of the woman who saw the Emperor was stained with fear.\u201cDad! Calm down. Mom\u201dEustis immediately drew the sword of the knight next to him and pointed it at the woman\u2019s throat.\u201cDad!\u201d\u201cNow, tell me. Did you change my daughter with yours?\u201dCatherine, who was trembling at the vicious force, opened her mouth after a while.\u201cYe\u2026 yes. Ellencia is His Majesty\u2019s daughter. Princess Philomel\u2026 She is my daughter.\u201dPusuk. The sound of flesh being torn and terrifying screams echoed.\u201cAaaagh!\u201dThe tip of the knife was embedded in Catherine\u2019s hand, which was on the floor.\u201cKyaaaagh! Uh, Mom!\u201dPollan grabbed the screaming Ellencia by the arm and pulled her away.Considering Eustis\u2019 temper, Catherine dies on the spot. But even though she was just a kidnapper, she was an adoptive mother who raised Ellencia. It was cruel to see her die right in front of her eyes.\u201cAnswer me. Why did you do that?\u201d\u201cAhhh.\u201dThere was no time to answer to someone struggling in pain.\u201cHow did you repay Isabella\u2019s kindness? Have you forgotten how nice Isabella was to you?\u201d\u201cShank. Da, you\u2026 \u201cThe face distorted by pain barely puckered.\u201c\u2026you! If you hadn\u2019t\u2026 ignored me! If Isabella\u2026 hadn\u2019t come down to her hometown! This never happened!\u201dAs if the pain in her body had made her forget her fear, the woman cursed. It was hard to find the witty young lady of the past in her demon-like appearance.The Emperor silently pointed the blade at Catherine\u2019s throat.\u201cDad! Please! Please don\u2019t kill my mother!\u201dEven the daughter\u2019s teary appeal could not stop the raised blade.Pollan covered the eyes of the struggling girl to keep Ellencia from seeing the horrible scene.However.Cheng Kang!Instead of the expected agony, there was the sound of metal hitting the floor.Eustis let go of the sword.\u201c\u2026similar.\u201dLooking down at Catherine, who was trembling in fear, he murmured dejectedly.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I know? That she looks like you.\u201dThen he turned and walked towards the door.\u201cPut her in jail.\u201dIt was about Catherine.\u201cI will take your order.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If she wasn\u2019t, she would have been already dead.\u201cAs expected, Catherine was the culprit! I told Isabella not to hang out with that lowly girl!\u201dThe nanny, who belatedly understood the situation, jumped.As Catherine had been a friend of the empress since childhood, the nanny seemed to know her well.\u201cMadam, thank you for your hard work. I\u2019ll drive you to your house in a carriage, so you can stop and go back.\u201dAt Pollan\u2019s words, the nanny clung to Ellencia.\u201cThe Count too! Because you can\u2019t be subtle. Who else can the princess trust and depend on, no other than me? Yes? Princess Ellencia.\u201d\u201cOh, yes, that\u2019s right.\u201dEllencia, who was lost in other thoughts, nodded.\u201cSo for the time being, I will stay in the imperial palace and take good care of the princess. Please arrange a room next to the residence of the princess.\u201dAt this point, it must be our intention to use Ellencia as an excuse to speak here.Looking at the nanny\u2019s pretentious smile, Pollan thought.Even at first glance, her clothes were ragged and the wrinkles deepened, revealing that her life outside the imperial palace was exhausting.Considering the history of the nanny, it was reluctant, but it made sense.One day, Ellensia was in a strange place where she didn\u2019t know anyone. It would be helpful for her, who has a long career as a nanny, to be by Ellencia\u2019s side.\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll prepare a place for you to stay.\u201d\u201cHoho! That makes sense.\u201d\u201cHowever, it is only until a new maid is selected to serve Lady Ellencia. Always remember what caused you to be kicked out, and watch your behavior.\u201d\u201cAh, okay. You speak harshly. Now, princess, let\u2019s go to your room.\u201dEllencia, who had followed the nanny, turned to Pollan. It was a dark expression.\u201cWell, count.\u201d\u201cYes, Miss Ellencia.\u201dThe priest had already confirmed that Ellencia had divine power. It was an enormous amount that was difficult for a country girl to have unless she was from the royal family.Moreover, it was revealed that Ellencia looked just like the empress when she was young because of her nanny. It was a fact that she was the real daughter.\u201cIsn\u2019t Daddy glad he found me?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201dPollan chose words to reassure the girl.\u201cIt can\u2019t be. He needs time to accept it. For over ten years, he has lived with Philomel as his daughter. Don\u2019t be too heartbroken.\u201dEllencia must have lived her whole life longing for her father, but to Eustis, she was a daughter he could never have imagined.\u201c\u2026 I guess so, right? Thank you for your words. I\u2019ll just go.\u201d\u201cMake yourself at home.\u201dThe new princess returned to her place.* * *Four or five men sat around the table where the food was set.\u201cDid you hear? Princess Philomel is not the real daughter of His Majesty the Emperor.\u201d\u201cI heard you. Wherever you go these days, it\u2019s all about that. The officials are also frantic to find the princess.\u201d\u201cThe princess is a piece of shit! According to rumors, she is the daughter of the bitch who kidnapped the real princess.\u201d\u201cThen, did the criminal\u2019s daughter live pretending to be the princess?\u201d\u201cHey, put aside any unconfirmed stories. If it was a false rumor, we\u2019ll all be blown away!\u201d\u201cHey, how can everyone be so loud when there\u2019s no basis?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe it either. The person reputed to be benevolent could be the blood of the kidnapper.\u201d\u201cI was afraid that it would be discovered that it was fake, so I hid my true identity. Don\u2019t you know anything about that? Innocent children.\u201d\u201cWhat do you think? I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\u201cWould you like to find a fake princess and sell it for a bounty?\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, even your wife who left the house will come back!\u201d\u201cWhy is this human talking about that again?\u201dLoud laughter erupted.Afterward, the topic changed from the fake princess to the wife who left the house, and they chatted about leaving the restaurant.Philomel pushed her hat even deeper for no reason. Even though I woke up early today and changed my hair color with the dye I bought at the market, I was not relieved.Philomel was eating breakfast in the restaurant attached to the inn.When I arrived at Angelium yesterday, it was too late to visit the magic tower. The Magic Tower was only open to the public during the day.A waitress came up and asked.\u201cMy lady, when you finish eating, shall we serve tea?\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s okay, I\u2019m going out now.\u201dPhilomel put down the tableware and stood up.\u201cAre you going to stay here tonight?\u201d\u201cUm. I\u2019ll decide later after seeing the situation.\u201dA few people looked at Philomel as he left the restaurant, but soon looked away. It was the effect of presence-erasing magic.When I went outside, people were gathered in twos and threes in front of the bulletin board.\u201cIs this woman the fake princess?\u201d\u201cShe looks nice.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s still a fraud.\u201dI walked down the street, trying not to face it as much as possible.Magic isn\u2019t omnipotent. If someone suspected that she was the princess in the painting from the beginning and looked closely, they could have noticed it.Because of that, it took more time than expected to get to Angelium by bypassing the middle gateway.Copies of Philomel\u2019s portrait were plastered on bulletin boards and every wall, and the security guards patrolled from time to time, blinking their eyes.Since she was already a woman alone, she only went around when the sun was up, so the speed was slow, but the restrictions only increased.\u201cHa. Am I that bad?\u201dStill, I hoped that he would turn a blind eye to her because he still had a bit of affection.The purpose of finding and bringing\u00a0 Ellencia was also to earn the Emperor\u2019s favor as much as possible. Of course, the biggest purpose was to confuse people, so she could easily escape.In any case, seeing the extensive search operation using all the manpower at their disposal, it seemed that they wanted to capture Philomel no matter what.\u2018If I get caught, I won\u2019t be safe.\u2019Perhaps the crime of escape is added, and he may go straight to the execution site.Eustis, who was coldly looking down at young Philomel in her head, and the gentleman who gave her a birthday present crossed paths.The chest area was tingling. So she walked briskly on purpose.If Le Guin, whom she would meet in the future, accepted Philomel like in the book, she would be protected by the Magic Tower, but if not, she planned to go abroad immediately.Even in the book, since he accepted \u2018Philomel\u2019, who had fled before being executed, it seemed that she could put aside the worry of being accused of being a fake princess.After all, he was the biological father.After walking for about 10 minutes from Angelium, the magic tower appeared.The huge stone buildings resembled fortresses or castles rather than towers, except that they reached high into the sky.Originally, it was in the form of a tower, but as magicians gathered from all over the world and repeatedly expanded it, it became like this.The Magic Tower is geographically adjacent to the Empire and has free passage, but is treated as a separate administrative district. And the head of this place and the head of the wizards are called the Mage Tower Master.\u201cIf you wish to make a request, please come this way!\u201dStanding in front of the small entrance on the side of the magic tower, a man shouted.There was a long line starting from the entrance. Fifty people could easily see through eyes.Since the beginning was the wizard guild, many people came to the Mage Tower to make requests.Hesitated. She was at a loss as to how to meet Le Guin.If you claim to be the hidden daughter of the Lord of the magic tower, you will surely be treated like a madman. Even so, she couldn\u2019t blindly ask for a meeting with the owner of the tower.I heard that Le Guin, the magic tower lord wrapped in a veil, does not easily meet even if a great noble comes.\u201cShould I just pretend to be crazy and tell him I\u2019m your daughter?\u201dBut if you say it over there, it will attract a lot of people\u2019s attention.Then someone approached Philomel.\u201cLady, do you have something to do at the Mage Tower?\u201dHe was a neatly dressed old man.\u201cYes, that is correct.\u201d\u201cEh, that\u2019s wrong. Look at the line over there. Even if you stand at the end now, you won\u2019t be able to see the wizard\u2019s shadow today.\u201d\u201cI see. I should come early in the morning.\u201dPhilomel became impatient.The magic tower is not always open to the outside world. If I missed today, I would have to wait until next week, but I didn\u2019t have time. Even now, the fear of the search was choking me every moment.\u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s no way.\u201d\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m working on supplying miscellaneous goods to the tower, so I know a few wizards. I\u2019ll introduce you if you want.\u201dMaybe this is an opportunity. If she met the wizard and explained the situation well, there was a possibility that she would meet with the owner of the mage tower separately.\u201cThen Please introduce me.\u201d\u201cGreat. Fifty silver.\u201d\u201c\u2026was it paid?\u201d\u201cWhere in the world is there anything for free? I have to earn pocket money too.\u201dunderstood. This person is a broker.What Philomel felt when she jumped out into the world was that there were outside rules.\u201cI\u2019ll give it to you now. Hold on.\u201dPhilomel took out a pocket from her bosom and counted the money inside.Considering that the cost of a night\u2019s lodging was 2 silver, 50 silver was quite expensive, but it was enough money.Unfortunately, Philomel did not see the old man\u2019s eyes light up when he saw the gold coins in her pocket.\u201cGive me this!\u201d\u201cOh!\u201dThe old man suddenly snatched the bag and ran away. No, he was trying to run away.\u201cThere are still people who commit low-level scams like this.\u201d\u201cAhh!\u201dSuddenly, the old man lost his balance and rolled on the floor. What caught my eye was someone\u2019s outstretched leg.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The owner of the leg, a man in a robe, tossed the pouch toward Philomel.\u201cOh, thank you.\u201dPhilomel took the pouch and gave a bewildered thanks.\u201cAre you out of your mind? Didn\u2019t you know that scammers appear around here when you come to the Mage Tower?\u201d\u201cI did not know.\u201dPhilomel replied quietly.\u201cA child who knows nothing of the world.\u201dI was moved, but I had no words to refute it because it was true that I did not know the world. It wasn\u2019t the kind of knowledge that could be learned by studying in books.At that time, the scammer took advantage of the conversation between Philomel and the man and crawled.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201dKnock-!The man in the robe stomped hard on the scammer\u2019s back.\u201cAh! You little fellow! Do you know how old I am? You don\u2019t even have parents!\u201dThe scammer screamed, even with his back crushed.\u201cUnfortunately, my parents didn\u2019t teach me the virtue of respecting the elderly.\u201dThe man in the robe replied in a non-trivial voice.As his feet gained more strength, the scammer\u2019s face turned yellow with a thud.\u201cYou must know that this is the territory of the Mage Tower. I will deal with it according to the law of the Mage Tower, not the Imperial Law.\u201dBecause of the robe, she couldn\u2019t even see his face properly, but Philomel instinctively felt it.\u201cHe\u2019s going to kill him in this place.\u201dThe body stiffened.I had never experienced anything like the scene of a murder.\u201cSheesh.\u201dAt that moment, the man who saw the white Philomel removed his foot from the old man and shouted to the surroundings.\u201cLexion! Don\u2019t just watch, come out!\u201d\u201cOh, my God, you caught me.\u201dSuddenly, a stranger came out from behind Philomel. He was a red-haired man with glasses.\u201cAre you just watching your visitors get scammed?\u201d\u201cI just watched the situation because you went first. It\u2019s a big deal that you did a good deed.\u201d\u201cGood deeds freeze to death. I\u2019m going to hand this bastard over to the discipline department, so you should listen to what he\u2019s doing.\u201dAfter that, he grabbed the hem of the scammer\u2019s clothes and dragged him to the magic tower.The scammer was stunned because he had been hit in the face.A handsome man with an intelligent impression left beside Philomel and responded kindly.\u201cNow that it\u2019s like that, if you tell me your business, I will guide you wholeheartedly.\u201dPhilomel was still dumbfounded, but came to her senses and answered. It was an opportunity not to be missed.\u201cI want to see Le Guin, the Master of the Magic Tower. Could you arrange a meeting?\u201d\u201cHoo. Why do you want to see him?\u201dThe man raised his glasses and asked.\u201c\u2026because I am his daughter.\u201dPhilomel answered in a slightly trembling voice. The man may believe it or not, but it was true.There was a difference in the golden eyes of the man facing her.\u201cI see. If it\u2019s something like that, I\u2019ll make sure you meet him.\u201d\u201c\u2026 What?\u201dPhilomel, who didn\u2019t think the man would believe it, asked back in bewilderment.\u201cFollow me, I will guide you through the back door.\u201dBut the man took the lead with a casual look and started walking.Even after following him, Philomel couldn\u2019t erase the strangeness.The reaction was different from expected. As far as is known, Le Guin was single, and even though she was said to be his daughter, he showed no signs of doubting.He seemed surprised, but it wasn\u2019t too much of a surprise.For a moment, the assumption that Le Guin was married and might have children crossed her mind.Philomel spoke to the redhead ahead.\u201cHey, wizard.\u201d\u201cMy name is Lexion.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 Then Mr. Lexion?\u201d\u201cJust call me Lexion.\u201d\u201cThen Lexion.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cIs Mr. Le Guin married by any chance?\u201d\u201cNo way.\u201dThank God. At least, the possibility that he was having an affair with Catherine disappeared.Philomel nodded with a hard face.After a while, Lexion drew a geometric pattern with his finger on the closed iron door, and the spot turned red, and the door opened with a clicking sound.The two entered the stone building. Few people could be seen in the wide hallway.\u201cThe building is big, but there are not many people.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s still early morning for nocturnal wizards.\u201dA funny-looking dragon statue. A person running around with a bubbling test tube. A tree that bears a variety of fruits.It was full of strange and mysterious things, but Philomel was careful not to take her eyes off him.The structure of the building was entangled like a maze, and there was a risk of missing the Lexion if you distracted yourself even a little.\u201cHey, Lexion, who was the person who made the reservation to use the 6th lab today?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Cardin. But he ran out last week because he was bored, so I think it\u2019s still a long way to go before he comes back.\u201dLexion leisurely answered a passer-by\u2019s question.He did not forget to tap his foot on the wizard, who fell on the floor with the smell of alcohol.\u201cGo back to sleep, then you will turn back.\u201dAnd after setting Philomel in front of a room, he came out with an old book about ten minutes later.\u201cSorry. It\u2019s an old document, so it took me a while to find it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dHe said as he turned the paper over.\u201cIf you confirm a few things, I will meet Le Guin. What is your mother\u2019s name?\u201d\u201cYes? Ah, Catherine Hounds.\u201d\u201cHere it is.\u201d\u201cHow old are you? Please tell me what you know about your height, weight, and other physical characteristics.\u201dWhen Philomel stammered in response, Lexion closed the booklet.\u201cIt\u2019s confirmed. Let\u2019s go to Le Guin-sama\u2019s room.\u201dIt was a strange question and answer.\u2018Could it be that Catherine\u2019s information is written in that booklet?\u2019Philomel tilted her head.As they entered the large hall, Philomel asked him a question for the first time.\u201cHey\u2026 aren\u2019t you surprised?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cThat I am Le Guin\u2019s daughter.\u201d\u201cNot much. I\u2019m a little curious as to why you\u2019re late.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, you\u2019re late\u2026?\u201d\u201cWatch your step.\u201d\u201cAhh!\u201dAt that moment, the floor moved. No, the object that I thought was the floor moved. A circular footplate that was separated from the floor floated up and headed upward.\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s a floating stone.\u201dLater, Philomel relaxed quietly.Floating stones are stones that float in the air, and even in the imperial palace, they are used to having them in high buildings.\u201cYou seem to have some experience using it.\u201dOops.Philomel hastily explained. If she said she had seen something precious like floating stones, there was a risk that her identity would be revealed.\u201cI saw it in a book.\u201dPhilomel tried to ignore Lexion\u2019s curious gaze.\u201cWe\u2019ve arrived.\u201dWhen we reached the top floor and reached the innermost room, he looked at Philomel\u2019s hand.\u201cAnd why don\u2019t you leave that out? He\u2019s not a big fan of divine power.\u201dIn the corner of her gaze, the red jewel of the ring glistened.\u201c\u2026 I didn\u2019t mean to hide my identity because I had bad intentions.\u201dPhilomel took out the ring of red flame and put it in her bag as if to make an excuse. From Lexion\u2019s point of view, it could have been seen as a suspicious person trying to hide her identity.\u201cI know who you are.\u201dHowever, Lexion put his hands on the back of his neck and spoke indifferently.Philomel stared at him with her eyes wide open in bewilderment.\u201cUnlike other wizards, I read the newspaper every day, and I am very interested in what goes on in the world. Her Highness, Princess Philomel.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Are you going to accuse me?\u201dPhilomel asked in a very nervous voice.\u201cHaha. If that were the case, I wouldn\u2019t have guided you here. Hold on to your worries. If I have one piece of advice, don\u2019t listen too much to what Le Guin says.\u201dHe opened the door, speaking incoherently.\u201c\u2026thank you.\u201dPhilomel bowed her head and entered the room.The room was filled with miscellaneous items and felt cramped even though it was not a small area.Philomel stood in the doorway as Lexion made his way through the obstacles. It took me a week to come here, and I was nervous again.My biological father, who is here.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Now?\u201dIt may be a bit late, but the statement about the mother is consistent with the data. However, there is no record that the mother gave birth to a child in the data.\u201d\u201cSince there was no news, the person in charge at the time must have judged that she was not pregnant or had a miscarriage.\u201dIt was about Philomel, but Philomel knew nothing about it.\u201cShe\u2019s here right now. Would you like to meet her?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll have to see it at least once.\u201dBefore long, a figure suddenly rose from the back of the desk.Philomel looked sideways at Le Guin\u2019s face. Golden eyes shone strangely under the tousled silver hair.Having seen Eustis and Nassar, I was confident that I wouldn\u2019t budge on a tolerable handsome man, but her eyes widened.It was so beautiful that it burned.And he was very young. I vaguely imagined him to be old, but at most he looked only in his early thirties. The corner that resembles Philomel is\u2026 Do they have similar eye colors? Although her own is not a brilliant golden color like his, it is closer to the color of Forsythia.Suddenly, Philomel recalled that Lexion\u2019s eyes are similar.Just looking around a little more, she met Le Guin\u2019s sharp gaze.At that moment, a strange sense of alienation came down Philomel\u2019s body.\u2018Something differentSomehow this man felt like a creature fundamentally different from herself and the rest of us.\u201cWhat is this? This feeling.\u201dThe silver-haired man erased his sullen face when he saw Philomel and smiled seductively.\u201cHello? My name is Le Guin. What will your name be?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Phil \u2026\u201dI couldn\u2019t reveal my real name, so I gave it a nickname. She was never called by a nickname, though.\u201cYes, Phil. Sit here for now.\u201dLe Guin prepared a place by roughly cleaning out the clutter that occupied the sofa.\u201cShall I leave?\u201cI have something to say after this, so stay here.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dTo Lexion\u2019s question, Le Guin answered as if his business with Philomel would be over soon.Philomel and Le Guin sat down and Lexion stood nearby.\u201cHand.\u201dHe reached out his hand to Philomel, who was stiff with tension and wondering how to start talking.\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cCan you give me your hand?\u201dPhilomel hesitantly held out her hand, and Le Guin grabbed it. Hard, big hands\u2026\u201cHeuk\u2026!\u201dThe sudden pain made it difficult to breathe. It was the feeling of something entering her body and tearing through her body.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no magic. No, there\u2019s a bit of it, but it\u2019s kind of like an empty shell.\u201dLe Guin murmured, looking down at the squatting Philomel.\u201cAre you okay?\u201dLexion approached and protested instead of Philomel.\u201cThis man! You should do this after asking for permission. It\u2019s hard to bear if you\u2019re not a wizard.\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. I thought you were a wizard because you said you were my child.\u201dPhilomel raised her upper body and looked at them alternately.\u201cWhat the hell is this\u2026?\u201dLexion explained.\u201cHe checked your mana by injecting his mana. Mana tells us whether you\u2019re his daughter or not. It\u2019s a bit stinging for magicians, but it must have hurt you. I apologize for that. That\u2019s the kind of person he is\u2026\u201dLe Guin added, ignoring Lexion\u2019s subtle criticism.\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculously small, but the mana is there.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s my real daughter.\u201dIt was a moment of reunion that was neither touching nor dramatic.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201dIn the meantime, I have pictured the moment I met my biological father hundreds or thousands of times.From a touching encounter that cannot be seen without tears, to a development where you are coldly kicked out saying that you cannot be recognized as a daughter.But the situation that had now unfolded was of a kind that she had never imagined.Le Guin\u2019s attitude was too businesslike to meet a daughter he didn\u2019t even know existed.\u2018There were many things I wanted to ask when we met\u2026Why did you leave pregnant Catherine behind? Didn\u2019t he know that he had a daughter named me?How did you accept the \u2018Philomel\u2019 in the book?And\u2026 Do you have any affection for me?\u2019Questions that had not been asked for years floated in my heart.Le Guin spoke first.\u201cYou have a lot of questions, you can ask.\u201dPhilomele opened her mouth and asked the first question.\u201c\u2026why did you leave your pregnant mother alone?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t remember, but your mother would have wanted to stay there. Other than that, I recommended staying in the tower.\u201dI can\u2019t understand the meaning of what that man is saying.Even knowing that the conversations didn\u2019t mesh, Philomel focused more on other things.\u201c\u2026you don\u2019t remember?\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s been over ten years.\u201dI was speechless at Le Guin\u2019s natural attitude.Catherine and Le Guin had a one-night stand.\u201cMy mother\u2019s name is Catherine Hounds. She looks a lot like me. Don\u2019t you remember anything when you see my face?\u201dLe Guin put his face close to Philomel and pointed his finger at her hair.\u201cDyeing.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dCome to think of it, I dyed my hair in the morning. I thought I would erase it.When Le Guin snapped his finger, a cool energy spread through her head. In the blink of an eye, Philomel\u2019s hair returned to its original color.\u201cWell, I feel like I\u2019m going to think of something\u2026\u201dThe man who crossed his arms and searched for memories smiled brightly.\u201cSorry, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201c\u2026how, how could you not remember?\u201d\u201cDo you have any reason to remember?\u201dPhilomel\u2019s eyes grew hot when she saw a man proudly asking back.\u201cWhat do you want more than that? The reason you came to me even late is that you want something, right? It\u2019s impossible to become a wizard because you don\u2019t have enough magical power, but is it money?\u201dThe back of my hand got wet.Philomel realized a little later that the water on the back of her hand was her tears.\u201cI\u2019ll add up the amount your mother didn\u2019t take and give it to you so you won\u2019t be disappointed\u2026\u201dI\u2019ve forgotten my tears for a long time. Because the world didn\u2019t appease Philomel for crying.\u201cWhy are you crying?\u201dThe man\u2019s eyes widened as if he didn\u2019t know why.\u201cI don\u2019t need it. I don\u2019t need money or anything from you.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re just like strangers. I\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have come to you.\u201dPhilomel gathered her belongings and headed for the door.\u201cYou\u2019ll never see me again, so take care.\u201dAs she was about to leave, Philomel turned around and gave her last words to the man who brought her into the world.\u201c\u2026 Why are you so angry?\u201dLe Guin looked stunned at the spot where Philomel had left.\u201cOh! You could have said it nicely, but you are a human being\u2026\u201dLexion got annoyed and hurriedly left the room.Not knowing the way back, Philomel ran aimlessly. Hot tears continued to flow down as if the tear glands were broken.I thought I didn\u2019t expect anything, but. In one corner of my heart, I was longing for the affection of my biological father. Like a fool\u201cWait!\u201dLexion, who had followed up, called and stopped her.Philomel wiped the moisture from her eyes with her sleeve and turned her head.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cI will guide you to the exit. Could you please listen to me in the meantime?\u201dThere was no other way to get out of the Magic Tower, so Philomel accepted his offer.Lexion opened his mouth as they rode down the floating stone as they had come.\u201cJust in case, you don\u2019t seem to know much about your birth. Didn\u2019t your mother tell you?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, I don\u2019t know? No, there\u2019s a lot I don\u2019t know. But I got to know this one thing well. The fact that my biological father is a shameless person who doesn\u2019t even remember a woman with his child.\u201dEven though it wasn\u2019t Lexion\u2019s fault, the sharp words came out.Lexion scratched his cheek.\u201cThat\u2019s true, but\u2026 \u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I took out my anger for no reason. Lexion has nothing to do with it.\u201dPhilomel bit her lip and said.\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m your half-brother, after all.\u201dPhilomele gasped at the unexpected words.\u201cI see\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not surprised.\u201dI thought that not only the color of his eyes, but also his facial lines, seemed to resemble Le Guin.\u201cI heard that he never married, so he is an unscrupulous person who gave birth to two illegitimate children.\u201d\u201cFour people. You have two more brothers beside me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBy the way, all three of our mothers are different.\u201dThe shocking fact added to the shocking fact.What kind of house is this?My head is pounding.Lexion continued.\u201cI won\u2019t deny your assessment of Le Guin\u2026 but don\u2019t you want to know the secret behind your birth?\u201dPhilomel nodded helplessly as he began to explain.\u201cLe Guin is a man who doesn\u2019t know love. He doesn\u2019t exactly know most human emotions. He won\u2019t understand the slightest bit of parental love, attention, or whatever you want from him.\u201d\u201c\u2026 But he had children with several women. Was it just that desire?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s part of the misunderstanding. He has never had an intimate relationship with any woman.\u201d\u201cThen how did he have so many children?\u201d\u201cIt was an experiment.\u201d\u2026 Experiment?To Philomel, who did not understand, Lexion explained further.\u201cIn other words, we are children born through experiments.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 25": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/There Is No Place For FakesCH 25Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOnce upon a time, there was a man. The man had no parents or siblings, but he had vast powers that might come only once in a thousand years.People called it \u2018Estelion\u2019 for its special magical power that can cause a tidal wave, change the weather, and kill a dragon with a single gesture.Estelion brought the man to the top of the line as a wizard\u2026Perhaps the master of great power, the man lacked most of the emotions that a normal person should have.There was momentary interest and displeasure, but what remained constant was curiosity and inquisitiveness of Estelion.There were many mysterious parts of that power that even the man who possessed it did not know about.A man who was immersed in his studies had a fear one day. If he died, the research he devoted his life to would be in vain.The man hoped that someone with an Estelion like himself would appear and continue his research. A man who hadn\u2019t needed a family his whole life wanted children.So the man experiments.It is a method of injecting seeds made by combining Estelion and body tissue into a woman\u2019s uterus with body penetration magic, and precautions are taken when culturing seeds with a fairly difficult task\u2026Oh, skip the details, huh? Okay, I guess I overdid it.In any case, applicants with various backgrounds and physical characteristics were recruited from all over the country.It was a human experiment, but when a large amount of money that a commoner could not even dream of was promised as a reward, numerous applicants flocked to it.If you don\u2019t have luxury, you can eat and play forever. My mother still travels around the world with the money she received then.While she gave birth to me safely and raised me, she received additional money, and now she is as rich as a lower aristocrat.But not all were like mothers. Many of the experiments have failed.Whether it is because the act of artificially creating life is against divine law, because Estelion is a dangerous power, or because the experimental design itself is wrong, the reason is unknown.The placenta was not even conceived, the other half were miscarried during pregnancy, and most of the lucky births died in infancy. Well, there is also a reason why we recruited a lot of applicants because of successive failures.The number of children who have survived to this day is three, including me.No, because you are there too, it has grown to four.All three of us grew up in the facility and know each other well enough to be fed up.Ah, the facility is a place that Le Guin established inside the Magic Tower. It was to gather applicants in one place and effectively manage their health.Records show that your mother refused to enter the facility, and there were a handful of applicants who did not want to leave their residence.They would have guided such applicants to deliver the test results through a separate letter, but I wonder why your mother didn\u2019t do that.Since we have not been contacted, this site has not been able to grasp your existence at all. Returning to the original subject, the experiment story, as a result, the experiment was not successful.All three of my brothers are wizards, and each has their talents, to say the least.However, only a small part of Estelion\u2019s power was inherited. As you can see, you don\u2019t seem to have much power either.After that, Le Guin gave up trying to have a child to inherit Estelion. Instead, he stopped aging and turned to live a long, long life.Even if you look like that, your actual age is much older than your appearance. Perhaps he will live on for a long time after everyone around him is dead.Personally, it\u2019s a lonely life, but\u2026 whatever. The person does not even feel lonely.* * *After hearing Lexion\u2019s long story, Philomel asked.\u201cSo what? It\u2019s hard to help that he\u2019s a heartless father.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to make excuses. What I just wanted to say is that it was the first time he had a child like you, so I had a feeling that he was even more inconsiderate and spoke out.\u201d\u201cLike me\u2026?\u201d\u201cTo be honest, all three of our brothers are on the weak side, although not as much as Le Guin. Especially when it comes to love.\u201dLexion raised the frame of his glasses.\u201cLe Guin didn\u2019t treat us like children, and we didn\u2019t want to be fathers either. Although he provided us with food, clothing, and shelter and taught us magic, he is more like a mentor or boss than a father.\u201d\u201cI think I belong to the normal axis when it comes to emotions.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s amazing. I don\u2019t think Le Guin expected you to be so disappointed.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s hard to keep my inner emotions in check, but too much information came in.Like Estelion or an experiment. It was only a big story, so it didn\u2019t touch me very much.One thing is for sure\u2026 There was no affection anywhere in Philomel\u2019s birth.In addition, unlike Lexion and his brothers, Philomel claimed to have no magical powers. It meant a complete failure.The two of them walked quietly until they reached the entrance they had entered at first.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll just go. Thank you for the guidance.\u201d\u201cPhil.\u201dLexion called the nickname of Philomel, was about to say hello mechanically and leave.\u201cIf you need help, come to me anytime. If you pick up someone from the Mage Tower and ask them to call Lexion, you can meet me.\u201d\u201cWhy do you care about me so much? Because I\u2019m your sister?\u201d\u201cIf I say that is the only reason, you won\u2019t believe me, will you? I just said that I\u2019m on the weak side of emotions.\u201d\u201cYes. Right now, I can\u2019t believe it even if the sun rises in the west.\u201dOriginally, it was not a personality that had a deep trust in others, but it seemed that the distrust of humans would become more severe.\u201cI have an academic interest in you. Why are you born with the same experiment, yet we have half emotions and you are normal? I want to research this.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it because I only have a little Estelion?\u201dI\u2019m sure he thinks so, but\u2026 I think there\u2019s another reason, a simple one. It\u2019s just a feeling.\u201dLexion was persistent.\u201cIf you don\u2019t like research, why don\u2019t you just work as an assistant next to me? I\u2019ll pay you well.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t even know the letter \u2018M\u2019 in magic. Anything that would help\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can learn it. You can learn it in no time.\u201dLexion seemed to value Philomel higher than herself.\u201cIf you want to hide your identity, the magic tower is perfect. Even if their identity is revealed, the Mage Tower is a place that even the Emperor cannot touch.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Okay. Give me some time to think.\u201d\u201cAs much as you like. If you change your mind, come to the Mage Tower anytime.\u201dLexion stood there until Philomel disappeared. Watching my back walk on its path with no sign of sadness or disappointment.\u201cNow. Then, what should we do with that person who has no answers?\u201dLexion returned to Le Guin\u2019s room. He noticed a man squatting behind the desk, as he had on his previous visit.On the wide floor where the clutter was removed, there was a magic circle painted with red paint.Le Guin was staring at the magic circle made up of various symbols and hieroglyphs while holding a brush in one hand.\u201cLe Guin, I\u2019m here.\u201dHe knew Lexion came in, but he even pretend to not know, so he announced it out loud.\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the one who told me to stay because you need to talk to me\u201d.\u201cI saw you staring at me as if you were going to kill me. Why didn\u2019t you just go with her? Your sister.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me who killed my sister, it was Cardin.\u201d\u201cEither that or you.\u201d\u201cPhil, do you care about her?\u201dLe Guin replied bluntly.\u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d\u201cI think it bothers you. The magic circle doesn\u2019t change at all from before.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt took more than twenty minutes just to escort Philomel to the exit and back. For Le Guin, it was more than enough time to complete three more magic circles.\u201cWho cares. She ran out because she didn\u2019t like me, that\u2019s it.\u201dChildish person.Apart from his excellent abilities as a wizard, his father had a side that was less than a child\u2019s in interpersonal relationships. Maybe it was because I didn\u2019t have the opportunity to make deep emotional connections with others.\u201cAll right. If Le Guin says so, I won\u2019t care anymore. It\u2019s a pity, though. The kid seemed to have nowhere to go. How will a child who is not yet of age live in this harsh world\u2026\u201dLexion deliberately threw a small stone at Le Guin. For the purpose of further spreading the ex-communication that has already occurred.\u201cI happened to see it, and if Jeremiah hadn\u2019t helped her earlier, she would have almost lost all her money to the pickpocket.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201dListening to the weak reply, Lexion estimated when Le Guin would be honest.A week to guess? No. Judging by the strangely nervous reaction, it might be decided within two or three days.Ten hours later.Lexion, who had gone to bed early for a wizard, was awakened by the sound of a door knocking open. Le Guin, with a gruff face, was standing by his bedside.\u201cWhat are you doing at this hour?\u201dLexion asked as he fumbled across the bedside table looking for his glasses.\u201cYou know where she\u2019s staying, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dWarm-colored hair rubs against the sleeping head.\u201cOh, Phil? I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll stay in Angelium.\u201d\u201cCall her to come to the Magic Tower right away. We need to meet her one more time.\u201d\u201cDo you know what time it is? I\u2019m sure she\u2019s sleeping too. I\u2019ll call her as soon as the morning comes, so get some sleep.\u201dAfter sending Le Guin roughly, Lexion went back to sleep with a somewhat pleasant feeling. Thinking of welcoming a new family.But the next morning, Lexion, who went to Angelium to find Philomel, couldn\u2019t help but regret the choice he made last night.As Le Guin said, I had to go find her right away yesterday. Because Philomel had already left the city.In the worst possible way.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 26": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/There Is No Place For FakesCH 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter leaving the magic tower and returning to Angelium\u2019s quarters, Philomel lay down on an old bed. It was well past lunchtime, but she had no appetite.Several thoughts ran through my head. Real father, experiment, failed work, older brother, wanted flyer, escape\u2026Philomel closed her eyes as if running away from reality and tried to fall asleep.Hunger woke me from a dark sleep.I checked the clock and it was already dinner time. I skipped lunch and went to bed.\u201cHungry\u2026 \u201dGrowlEven in sadness, hunger always came.Philomel barely lifted her heavy body. I have to put something in my stomach to continue this life.When I went down to the inn\u2019s restaurant and ate some hot bread and soup, I felt a little cheered up. Her head also started spinning a bit.A child born as an experiment.Hearing her birth story for the first time was shocking. I never thought there would be a backstory like this for \u2018Philomel\u2019, who is only a supporting character in the novel.When I learned the situation, there was a puzzle that was matched.A woman who was kicked out of the imperial palace returned to her hometown, and a man who is a promising magician.I don\u2019t understand how these two people got involved, but it was the relationship between the experimenter and the subject.Also, looking at Ellencia\u2019s childhood described at the beginning of the novel, it did not feel like she was suffering from the hardships of life.Their standard of living, which I saw a few days ago, also complied. Even though there was no scene of either Catherine or Ellencia going to work for a living.The reward that Catherine would have received for participating in the experiment cleared all doubts.Up until now, she had declined, but she thought Catherine\u2019s parents, who took pity on their daughter\u2019s circumstances, were sending money.\u201cHa\u2026\u201dI didn\u2019t want my biological parents to be dead and living lovers. Still, it felt strange to know that she was born out of necessity.Both Catherine and Le Guin do not wish for themselves. Unlike Ellencia, who was loved by everyone, she was not even allowed to love her biological parents.I was at a loss as to what to do next.Reasonably, it was better to accept Lexion\u2019s proposal. She was reluctant to live under the same roof as Le Guin, but the magic tower was attractive.The tower was huge, so I thought I might not run into it if I avoided Le Guin.Even if I left for a foreign country as originally planned, there was no clear way to live.I thought about what it would be like to become a teacher by using the various knowledge I learned as a successor. \u2018A tutor for a noble family wouldn\u2019t be bad either.\u2019 and vaguely drew the future.However, the search operation to find Philomel was more thorough than expected.\u2018At this rate, it wouldn\u2019t be easy to obtain a disguised identity or to board a ship going abroad.\u2019Even if she went abroad safely, it was only natural that she would have to continue to hide her identity with anxiety.\u2018When will Eustis stop looking for me?\u2019It would be nice if he could get so drenched in the happiness of meeting his real daughter that he would soon forget about Philomel.Even though I hoped so, my fingertips got cold as I imagined the two father and daughter being close.Philomel rubbed her fingertips to get warm and suddenly looked at the red ring.The light inside the jewel has faded more clearly than at first.It was only a matter of time before the divine power contained in the ring ran out.The ring is an object made for generations of emperors and their successors, and in addition to the functions Philomel used, it is said to have the ability to use defensive magic or detoxification.I heard that it plays a role in protecting the wearer\u2019s life in the event of a major change.The current Emperor himself is so strong that he does not wear a ring, but Philomel has been wearing it ever since she received it.Only the divine power of the sun god possessed by the royal family of Belerov is the power of the ring. Therefore, it was impossible to keep using the ring unless you met the royal family who was lucky to help Philomel.Philomel left much of her meal, got up, and asked the owner for directions.\u201cExcuse me. Where is the famous magic tool store around here?\u201dAfter hearing the approximate location, I left the restaurant and walked down the dark street.The first thing to do was to prepare a replacement for the ring. Let\u2019s think about the rest later.\u2018It\u2019s okay. After all, I was alone from the beginning. Nothing changes.\u2019As before, I can do well on my own in the future. I had to do well.Philomel consciously repeated, feeling lonely even among the crowd passing by.* * *Roseanne was the famous daughter of Viscount Manon, with a confident temper and a pretty appearance.However, she preferred to introduce herself as the niece of Duchess Muriel rather than Lady Manon.Viscount Manon was a prestigious family known in Saint-Gen, but they were local nobles anyway. There was no mansion in the capital, and I couldn\u2019t even set foot in the social world of the central aristocrats.On the other hand, the name of Duke Muriel, a famous family in the capital, was enough to satisfy her vanity.However, the sad situation of not being able to properly reveal one\u2019s last name ends today.Her father, Viscount Manon, has finally formed a position in the central political world after all his hard work.A few days later, he moves into a house that he bought in the capital by spending a lot of money.Roseanne\u2019s central social life was about to put on a grand opening.Roseanne has been having a hectic day because of that recently. Careful preparation was necessary to avoid being ignored by the aristocratic young men of the high capital.That was the reason why she moved to Angelium, the outskirts of the empire, today.\u201cI don\u2019t like anything. Bring me another one.\u201dAt Roseanne\u2019s words, the clerk headed into the restaurant.\u201cLady, everything looks pretty to me. Oh, my! Look at the bright things.\u201dRoseanne\u2019s maids were busy looking at the charms on display.Roseanne shot.\u201cWhat do those who have no discernment know? Don\u2019t talk, hold my dress tight, so it doesn\u2019t drag on the floor.\u201dThe two maids kept their mouths shut and focused their attention on the hem of her dress again.Not long ago, Roseanne received information from her cousin, Princess Muriel, that decorating a necklace and bracelet with magic is the latest trend in central society.It was only natural that Roseanne, who couldn\u2019t stand anything less than the best if it was hers, came to Anghelium.Even though there were many magic tool stores, it was incomparable to the shops in the magical city of Angelium in terms of product variety and reliability.If there\u2019s one thing I don\u2019t like\u2026Roseanne glared at the woman on the other side of the store.A woman dressed as a commoner was asking another clerk something.The clerk gave an embarrassing guide.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but magic tools that erase disguises or signs can only be sold with the permission of the state. There is a lot of potential for it to be abused for crimes.\u201dThere didn\u2019t seem to be anything she was looking for, but the woman stayed longer in the store.\u2018I have to shop in the same place as a commoner!\u2019Roseanne\u2019s judgment was twisted.Angelium has been recognized as a city thanks to its geographical importance adjacent to the Mage Tower, but its size was somewhere between a large town and a city.Because of this, there were no high-end stores that only received nobles as customers or were separated from commoner areas.Besides, seeing that she was looking for such a suspicious magic tool, it was clear that she was a person with bad intentions.Roseanne took a closer look at the woman\u2019s face. She was so uncharacteristic that she would forget it when she turned around. For some reason, I lost interest in an instant.\u201cYoung lady! I brought other charms.\u201dThe clerk will be back too. A brilliant red light was captured in Roseanne\u2019s eyes as she tried to return to her original purpose. It was the ring worn by a commoner woman. Roseanne, whose hobby is her jewelry collection, could tell.The jewel in the ring differed in luster from rubies and garnets, but it did not appear to be a poor imitation. It was not something a commoner could possess.\u2018It must have been stolen.\u2019For nobles, stealing valuables has always been one of the biggest headaches.Roseanne was the most unforgivable kind. People who don\u2019t even know the subject and covet more than a fraction.Whether or not the dress was dragging, Roseanne strode forward and snatched the woman\u2019s hand.\u201cOuch! This\u2026 What are you doing?\u201dWhile frowning at the violent touch, the woman answered with dignity. She\u2019s like a noble.Working as a maid for an aristocratic family, they seem to think that they are noble as well.\u201cGuys! Hold on to this!\u201dThe maids quickly grabbed hold of the woman\u2019s arms and body.\u201cLet go of me! I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re doing this\u2026 \u201c\u201cStay still!\u201d\u201cNo!\u201dAs Roseanne grabbed the ring with her finger, the woman struggled violently, but it was not enough to break the restraint.Roseanne put the ring in her purse and looked at the woman to scold her.\u201cYes?\u201dThe woman\u2019s face, which had been blurry until recently, looked different.The slim face line, slightly raised eyes, and harmonious features were good. Aside from being quite beautiful, it was a face that gave me a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.I\u2019ve seen it somewhere too recently, quite frequently.She would have been in the newspapers every day, and her face was attached to every wall.\u201cPrincess Philomel!\u201dAt Roseanne\u2019s cry, all eyes in the store were focused on one place.\u201c\u2026 You misunderstood the person.\u201dThe woman lowered her head as if trying to cover her face, but Roseanne was convinced. For decades, she was a fake princess, a fake princess who pretended to be a princess.\u201cHey! Report to the police immediately!\u201dRoseanne urged the clerk, who was distracted, to call the police.The woman denied it was pathetically hard.\u201cLady! Feel free to set me up! I look just like her, but I\u2019m not her!\u201dIt wasn\u2019t Roseanne who would be weakened by that.\u201cNo, what is it? You have the same shameless face.\u201d\u201cIt must have been similar\u2026\u201dSlap!Roseanne slapped the wicked woman on the cheek as hard as she could.\u201cHow dare you. Do you still think you\u2019re a princess?\u201dThe woman turned her head away with one cheek flushed and was speechless.\u201cI feel like I want to get rid of it right now, but I\u2019m patient.\u201dThe type of human that Roseanne hates the most is someone greedy for something beyond their means. This woman who lived as a princess on a fake subject was the pinnacle of that kind.When they said they had caught the fake princess, Roseanne handed the woman over to the police who arrived quickly.Then, she followed them to the police station and requested the security chief to receive a promise. Tell His Majesty the Emperor and the real Princess that Roseanne Manon\u2019s contribution was the greatest in capturing Philomel.In my mind, I wanted to wait until the high-ranking person came to send Philomel away, and then tell him in person. However, when I came into contact with the inside of the messy police station, I completely lost my mind.Roseanne excitedly got into the carriage heading home.The stupid woman has given social figures something to show off. Furthermore, it seemed that I could build a close relationship with a real princess with this opportunity.Viscount Manon was the torch to build a friendship with the princess once he entered the central social circle.\u201cI\u2019m really lucky.\u201dRoseanne said, something she used to say often.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As soon as she came to the police station, she was handcuffed and put in a detention cell.Both wrists were sore from the handcuffs, and one cheek burned from being slapped.Did you say your name is Roseanne Manon? The sheriff called her a young lady.It didn\u2019t come to mind at first, but soon I found memories of Viscount Manon\u2019s family.Since she was educated as an heir, she had all the information about noble families in her head.\u2018If it\u2019s Manon Viscount\u2026 \u2018It was an ordinary family with nothing remarkable about it, except for the fact that the Viscountess was a sister to Duchess Muriel. Although the personality of the young lady was not normal.It was the first time I had been slapped, so I was dumbfounded for a moment.\u2018I\u2019ve never been slapped on the cheek by a nanny.\u2019Moreover, considering the tingling pain in the cheek, not just pain, it felt like something had scratched it.\u2018Roseanne was wearing several rings.\u2019If it was a scratch on the ring, it would be scarred with a high probability.But it was not the time to worry about wounds or pain. Not only the security guards but also the other criminals brought in were watching Philomel as if they were monkeys in a zoo.\u201cIs that woman the famous fake princess?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the same as the wanted letter, so that\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cWhy did you do that when you were fine?\u201d\u201cYou know what? The bad blood that flows through your body can\u2019t be seen through the pond.\u201d\u201cI shudder at the thought of patrolling 12 times a day because of her.\u201dAt least the security guards were on the better side.\u201cHey! You\u2019re going to die anyway. Have fun with us!\u201d\u201cWhy? Are you not satisfied with people like us because you used to play noble and pretend to be a princess?\u201d]\u201cRoll in bed with me?\u201dThe sinners blatantly looked at Philomel and made unspeakable jokes.As the members did not actively restrain it, the water level only rose.The situation of being exposed to them through the bars gnawed at Philomel\u2019s spirit. However, if you imagine what will happen in the future, even this is not a big deal.\u2018I was stupid.\u2019I exposed the ring of red flame too much. Since the magic effect only works when the ring is worn, it cannot be removed from the finger.\u2018I should have kept my hands in my pockets.\u2019At least, it wouldn\u2019t have happened this far if she had activated the defensive magic by rubbing the ring before grabbing both arms.If she is brought before Eustis like this, she will die sooner or later.Thinking that the escape she had dreamed of for years would end in vain made her feel unfair before she was scared.No matter how hard the villain tries, can\u2019t he escape from his fate?I had to do something. I didn\u2019t want to do anything and wait for a certain ending.Philomel stared at the people behind the bars.\u201cExcuse me.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dThe security guards flinched when the fake princess, who hadn\u2019t moved at all until then, spoke to them.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you again, I\u2019m not a fake princess. My name is Charlotte Tate. I am just a tourist here to visit my family.\u201dPhilomel made up an improvised alias and excuse.One of the security guards, who seemed to be the most senior among them, stepped out.\u201cOh, my. I\u2019m speechless. Hey, let\u2019s get off to a good start. There\u2019s no one here to believe such a lie.\u201dIt didn\u2019t look like a good impression, but Philomel didn\u2019t give up.\u201cIs there not a single person in the world who looks similar?\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re just a lookalike?\u201d\u201cFrom what I saw in the newspaper, all the reports received so far have been false reports. You can\u2019t say it\u2019s just me.\u201dShut up! I know you\u2019re trying to get out of here!\u201dPhilomel took out the last move she made a while ago to the snorting man.\u201cFirst of all, I have a witness who will confirm my identity.\u201d\u201cWho is that?\u201d\u201cCall someone from the mage tower and call the wizard Lexion. I am his sister.\u201dWhen the story of the magic tower came out, the atmosphere among the members changed.Angelium\u2019s economy was so dependent on the Mage Tower that it would not be an exaggeration to say that it was driven by the Mage Tower.People who visited the Mage Tower spent money while staying in the city, and magic tools from there were the main specialties.Historically, friction arose between the Mage Tower and the Empire, and when the Mage Tower closed its doors, it was the citizens of Angelium who died the most.It was said that from their point of view, there was nothing good about them because they were hated by the wizards of the Mage Tower.\u201cLexion-sama? Did that woman just say Lexion?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s Lexion, is it the chief wizard of the magic tool management department?\u201d\u201cA disciple of the Master of the Magic Tower?\u201dMoreover, Philomel\u2019s brother whom she met for the first time today must have been quite a celebrity.If managing magic tools was his job, the security guard naturally had to pay attention.If not done carelessly, there may be a disruption in the supply of special products, and cooperation from the Mage Tower is essential to investigate crimes related to magic tools.Philomel let out a sigh of relief. She thought that if Lexion\u2019s name didn\u2019t work, she would drag Le Guin in as well, but she doesn\u2019t think it was necessary.The title of the daughter of the owner of the mage tower is so grandiose that it would sound like a bluff.\u201c\u2026 How can we believe you?\u201dAsked the security guard, who was sluggish.\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, call him and tell Bernie to come over here.\u201d\u201cBut at such a late hour\u2026\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t wake him up in the middle of the night, is it okay to leave your little sister in a place like this?\u201dAt Philomel\u2019s point, they put on a sullen expression. It was just before passing.Philomel decided that she would sell it anyway and that she would sell Lexion\u2019s name.\u201cMy older brother is a person who cares very much for his only sister. he would be so heartbroken if he knew that such a younger sister was even beaten and imprisoned in a place like this by a simple mistake.\u201dThe person who beat her was Roseanne, but she subtly blamed the police for the responsibility.\u201c\u2026 Well. Wouldn\u2019t it be okay to ask whether your younger sister visited Angelium?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. If that statement were true, it could end up being the only high-ranking person walking in vain.\u201dAs the opinions of the other members declined, the man had no other choice.\u201cGrunt. I can\u2019t believe it, but I\u2019ll get in touch with you. However, if it turns out to be a lie, I won\u2019t let you go, so be prepared. Even if a sinner\u2019s limb is not repaired, no one will care.\u201dEven the bloody threats did not frighten Philomel.A sense of relief spread that somehow the crisis was over.Heard that there are only two brothers, so if they ask about his sister, Lexion will naturally think of herself.All that remains is to expect him to come to terms with minimal improvisation.\u201cHey, there you are. Go to the magic tower and see if that woman is right\u2026 \u201d\u201cThere is no need for that.\u201d\u201cCaptain!\u201dSomeone who had just listened to the man giving instructions interrupted him. What they called the captain seemed to be the chief of the peace.\u201cA person who knows the fake princess has arrived. If you ask him, he\u2019ll figure it out right away.\u201dMy head was blank.\u201cAre they here already?\u201dThe chief of police responded to a member\u2019s question.. He was able to arrive early because he was on his way this way.\u201dWho the hell is that? No, whoever he was he knew who she was, it was over.\u2018I could have gotten out if I had had a little more time\u2026?God was not on her side either.Several footsteps and voices could be heard through the narrow hallway.\u201cCome this way. A report came in a few hours ago and she is locked up. The informant is a young lady named Rosanne Marnon, and she asked me to tell you a little bit about herself.\u201d\u201cWait a minute. What do you mean, you\u2019re locked up\u2026\u201dBefore long, Nassar Avrydon appeared. Philomel was one of those people who didn\u2019t want to show this side of himself.Nassar\u2019s eyes were fixed on Philomel in the cell.His honey-colored platinum hair shimmered in the light of the police station. The Little Duke of the world shined even in a cramped and noisy environment.She turned her head, wanting to hide in a rathole.\u201cYour Highness the Princess!\u201dEven so, Nassar\u2019s miracle of not recognizing his fianc\u00e9 did not happen.\u201cYou\u2019re all right! Really\u2026 I was worried. But why are you in a place like this\u2026? Please wait a bit.\u201dHe drew his sword from his waistband.He just had to borrow the key from them, but the barricade was cut off by the sword wrapped in an aura.As Nassar entered the cell, Philomel\u2019s handcuffed wrist caught his eye.\u201cCould you hold out your arms?\u201dThe handcuffs were also broken into two, like pieces of paper.\u201cYour Highness. Please return to the imperial palace with me.\u201dHe took Philomel\u2019s cold hand as if sharing warmth. The eyes glistening with water were unfamiliar.\u2018Why is he making that face?\u2019As if he genuinely cared about Philomel.\u201cHey, Little Duke. What kind of situation is this\u2026\u201dThe Chief was taken aback by the strange turn of events.\u201cAre you cold? Put mine on.\u201dWhether or not the Chief said so, the little Duke affectionately took off his overcoat and wrapped it around Philomel.Embarrassment appeared on the faces of not only the chief of police, but everyone present.It was because the Duke of Avrydon, who was supposed to take over the fake princess and send her away, showed an unexpected action.Under the circumstances, it seemed that the woman they had captured was Princess Philomel, but they didn\u2019t understand why the duke had treated her with respect.Princess Philomel was a fake, and if so, isn\u2019t she a sinner? Everyone on the street talked like that, and the newspapers used that tone\u2026At that time, something flashed in the head of the police officer.There was never a single time that an order to \u2018capture the criminal Princess Philomel\u2019 had been issued through an official route.It was only about finding the missing princess at all costs.Combined with the rumor that the real princess had appeared, such an order was naturally accepted as a search for the guilty.Looking back, I didn\u2019t question the strangely misinterpreted interpretation.\u2018Wait, if the princess isn\u2019t a sinner, what have we done?\u2019A cold sweat broke out on the back of Chief\u2019s neck.Even though they couldn\u2019t serve the innocent imperial family, they brought them and put them in a detention cell\u2026I can\u2019t even think of more than that! It was a serious crime to the point of being merciful to kill gracefully.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I left some knights of Avrydon, so don\u2019t think about running away.\u201dThe pressure of the only seventeen-year-old child gave them chills.\u201cNassar, wait a minute.\u201d\u201cYes\u201dWhen the princess stepped forward, the little duke returned to his gentle face as if he had never done so.The princess stood in front of the security guard, who had been doing a great distance before Nassar came.\u201cHere you go.\u201dA thin, white arm stretched out.\u201cYes, Yes\u2026?\u201dThe man who had contemplated in front of the princess stuttered.Not only the chief but also the members of the crew realized that this woman was still the princess.\u201cThey said they would break my limbs if it turns out I\u2019m a fake princess. I\u2019m giving you a special opportunity, so just do as you said.\u201d\u201cI-I\u2026 how dare I\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy can\u2019t you? Then you lied to me earlier.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that\u2014I was mistaken at the time\u2026\u201dThe gibberish man fell on his stomach and put his head on the floor.\u201cI have committed a mortal sin against the princess! Please spare my life, spare the lives of my family!\u201dUnbeknownst to him, a man who had committed a crime that could destroy his family begged.\u201cIt\u2019s all my fault as the person in charge! Please kill me!\u201d\u201cKill me!\u201dWhen the chief of police fell, the other members also hurriedly fell.\u201cWhether it\u2019s a fake princess or not, it\u2019s a crime to punish prisoners who haven\u2019t been tried on their own. You can\u2019t stop someone\u2019s crime, but you agree and stand by. Even so, are you guys the security guards protecting Belerov?\u201dAt the principled scolding, all ten mouths had nothing to say.The princess, who glanced at them, next stood in front of the prison cell.The compartment she entered was the area right next to it.\u201cYou.\u201dAt the gesture of the princess, the group of criminals split into two in an instant.The figure of the person hiding behind them was revealed.It was the man who said the most vulgar things to Philomel.\u201cYou want to roll in bed with me?\u201dUnlike the crew, the man could not make a sound properly and was trembling.\u2018It\u2019s not even worth arguing with.\u2019Philomel looked down at the man. It was a truly pitiful act.He proudly uttered insulting words, but couldn\u2019t even utter the words asking for forgiveness.Not wanting to look at him anymore, she headed down the hallway to get out.When the image of the princess disappeared, those who tried to catch their breath froze again.\u201c\u2026\u201dIt was because the little duke with the sword exuded a sense of murder.He stared into the cage with an expression half-lost.\u201cHey!\u201dThe murderous sinner started the game and eventually burst into a bubble.I had heard rumors that the young Avrydon heir was a genius, but to have reached this level at the age of less than twenty. Even in the absence of circumstances, the chief of police was genuinely admiring.It was impossible to stop him even if all the members of the crew rushed at once.Everyone expected the man to die soon.over and over again. Perhaps because everyone was holding their breath, the princess\u2019s footsteps could be heard especially well through the hallway.The Duke put the sword back into the scabbard and looked elsewhere.Then, he asked a crew member who mentioned the princess\u2019 limbs.\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d\u201c\u2026.. Ian Solbrit.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll remember that. The others here are the same. I\u2019ll be back here shortly, so don\u2019t try to run away.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cNo one runaways. I\u2019m not as merciful as her.\u201dAfter saying those words, the Duke quickly walked out into the hallway.In the place where the storm swept away, only dumbfounded people remained.Everyone felt it.The moment you try to run away, you will see something worse than death.* * *\u201cPrincess. It\u2019s not that way.\u201dIn front of the police station, Nassar stopped Philomel from going in the other direction. I tried to sneak away in the hectic gap, but it was too much.\u201cI\u2019ve got a carriage. Unfortunately, we all came on horseback\u2026 It might be inconvenient since it\u2019s a regular hire car, but you can rest in peace as long as you go to Saint-Gen.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay to stay here tonight.\u201d\u201cNo. There is no suitable place to rest for Your Highness in Angelium. Let\u2019s go to the hotel in Saint-Gen.\u201dNassar said, staring at the police station building. He wanted to leave this place as soon as possible.\u201cLet\u2019s get in.\u201dWhen the carriage arrived, he politely escorted me.Passers-by on the roadside stopped to watch them.The uniformed elite knights of Nassar and Avrydon stood out too much.\u2018There\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to stay here any longer.\u2019The luggage I left at the inn was trodden on in my heart. If nothing else, the <Princess Ellencia> book is there. If you pack your luggage, even the books will fall into Nassar\u2019s hands.He will hand over Philomel\u2019s belongings to the imperial family according to the transfer procedure, and if others check the contents of the book\u2026\u2018It\u2019s the worst.\u2019The book contains the truth that you want to hide. The fake princess who pretended to be nice was a villain who deserved to be executed.\u2018Let\u2019s give up the book for now.\u2019If you succeed in convincing Nassar from now on, you can come and pick it up later.Firstly, I had to talk to Nassar alone, avoiding people\u2019s eyes.Philomel called for Nassar, who gave instructions to the knight who had brought the horse.\u201cNassar\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cPlease ride Nassar too.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Am I also in the carriage?\u201d\u201cYeah, I have something to talk about.\u201dNassar entrusted his horse to the knight and followed Philomel into the carriage.It was a strange face that seemed nervous and happy at the same time.\u201dThe two of them were silent for a while inside the carriage that started to move. Something warm touched Philomel\u2019s cheek as she was lost in thought.\u201cThe cheeks are\u2026 swollen.\u201dNassar carefully touched the reddened skin.\u201cHow did this happen?\u201dIt seems that the eyes facing each other have sharpened a little.\u201cI fell.\u201d\u201c\u2026okay.\u201dIt was a wound that anyone could see, but Philomel\u2019s pride did not allow him to explain every word.In my experience, being slapped was a very humiliating thing.\u201cIt is an ointment made by the family mage.\u201dNassar pulled out a flat medicine bottle from his pocket.\u201cThis is what I use, and it works well. If it\u2019s not a big wound, it will heal quickly.\u201dAs a knight who handles swords, Nassar was often slightly injured.\u201cWhat I\u2019m doing is\u2026 you probably don\u2019t want it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll apply it myself.\u201d\u201cYes. Here you are.\u201dI was handed the medicine bottle. He may have shown a small kindness to her as a medicine, but Philomel was a burden.Philomel opened the cap and applied a green ointment with a strong herbal scent to her cheek. Which was certainly very hot.Nassar laughed softly.\u201cSoon there will be no trace of it.\u201d\u201c\u2026thanks.\u201dPhilomele, however, could not laugh at ease.\u00a0 My head ached, not knowing how to overcome this situation.Nassar had a big misunderstanding, or perhaps he was too uptight.According to common sense, the Emperor could not have ordered Philomel to be searched for as his missing daughter.The reason for not revealing that it is fake at this point is probably because it is not too late to announce it after catching Philomel and everything becomes clear. It was refreshing to use his misunderstanding to frighten offended people.\u2018What can I do? How can I get out of this place?\u2019No matter how much I rolled my head, no trick came to mind.Nassar is different from the security guards. He was not a great man to be fooled by improvised lies.\u2026 This is how it happened, it\u2019s a judge.\u201cYour Highness, do you have any concerns\u2026\u201d\u201cNassar! Do me a favor!\u201dPhilomel took the lead before Nasar came up with it.\u201cPlease, pretend you never saw me today!\u201d\u201cYes? That\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease!\u201dI ran to the other side and grabbed him by the hem of his clothes and hung on.\u201cNow, wait a minute! It is dangerous to get up suddenly. And\u2026 It\u2019s too close!\u201dNassar flinched at the face of Philomel, who was suddenly pushed in front of his nose.Afraid that Philomel might fall in the wobbly wagon, he grabbed her by the waist. As a result, she became hugged by Nassar.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Nassar doesn\u2019t want me to be that way, does he?\u201d\u201cCalm down. It can\u2019t be. Who dares harm the princess?\u201d\u201cOf course, His Majesty the Emperor!\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes? That\u2019s a misunderstanding. Your Majesty is truly concerned about Her Highness, the princess.\u201dI suppressed my desire to question whether it made sense.\u201cWhy would you worry about me who\u2019s not even a real daughter? I\u2019m sure you\u2019re grinding your teeth.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all a rumor that the princess is a fake\u2026\u201d\u201cNo. I am certainly not his daughter.\u201dPhilomel suppressed her frustration and answered.\u201cI can\u2019t\u2026\u201dHe hesitated for a moment in shock, then shook his head.\u201cNo, even if that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s true that His Majesty is worried about the princess. Count Pollan said so, too.\u201d\u201cIt must be the Count\u2019s misunderstanding.\u201dPollan was more or less inclined to look at the world with compassion.\u201c\u2026\u201dPhilomel\u2019s determined attitude confused Nassar.He, too, had heard everything from Pollan and had not met the Emperor himself.\u201cNo way, the Emperor really\u2026?\u2019Philomel didn\u2019t miss the confusion on his face.\u201cPlease, Nassar\u2026 Please let me go. If you do, I\u2019ll do anything you want.\u201dNassar\u2019s pupils shook greatly.Seeing that face, Philomel was sure that she had a chance to survive.Nassar is upright and good in character. Like \u2018Philomel\u2019 in the book, he was merciless when she bullied Ellencia, but he was kind to everyone else. At least he didn\u2019t have the personality to push Philomel to death.For the past several years, they have maintained an amicable relationship without bothering Nassar and keeping a reasonable distance.Everyone looked at the princess and the duke and agreed that it was an ideal engagement relationship. She thought he might turn a blind eye to her once in a while if she appealed to his sympathy.It was not difficult for Nassar to silence the duke\u2019s knights and Angelium\u2019s security guard.She said that she would do anything, but it was an empty remark since the good Nassar would not make unreasonable demands.\u201c\u2026\u201dHowever, Nassar\u2019s reaction was unusual.\u201cWhy, why do you put me to the test with such words?\u201dThe tear-stained Nassar removed Philomel with an overly polite hand and sat her down. His fingers were trembling, though slightly.\u201cWhat did I\u2026?\u201dPhilomel was puzzled.\u2018What did I do!\u2019Is it my fault that I asked for help? What does it mean to put you through the test?Nassar, who was brushing his bangs, lowered his head.\u201cWhat I just said was presumptuous to Your Highness. I apologize.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t know, but there\u2019s nothing to be sorry about.\u201dAfter the meaningless apology, there was only silence.Nassar looked out of the wagon with a disappointed look on his face. It was more like a feeling for himself than a feeling for Philomel.Was there anything in the conversation he could have blamed himself for?Suddenly, Nassar opened his mouth.\u201cI cannot accept your request not to inform the Emperor.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dNassar, who saw Philomel, said in a tone that he was speechless.\u201cThe fact is\u2026 I have instructed to send a message to the imperial palace before getting into the carriage.\u201dThe image of Nassar, who was saying something to the knight, flashed through my head.\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I can\u2019t wait to tell you the good news that I\u2019ve found the princess\u2026 I sent it through a magic messenger, so it will reach the Emperor as early as the morning.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dPhilomel calmly tried to figure out the situation. At least there are no wizards in these groups, so it\u2019s a relief that they used a telegraph instead of a communication stone.While the communication stone required a wizard, anyone could use the communication stone as long as they had previously charged mana.\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped that the Emperor finds out about this, but I still want to help you.\u201dNassar looked up and continued talking.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay at the villa owned by Avrydon? I will report to the Emperor that I missed the princess, or that it turned out to be someone else.\u201d\u201cWould anyone believe that? Even if they believe it, only a little Duke will become a fool.\u201dMissing a woman with a group of men and mistaking a fianc\u00e9 were excuses that were hard to accept.And that excellent little duke of Avrydon? Not just Eustis or even a passing three-year-old would trust this.\u201cIt\u2019s okay to be treated like an idiot, I am only concerned about your well-being.\u201dIt was a touching line, but the person was wrong. She was not Ellencia.\u201cI\u2019m not okay. Above all, I don\u2019t know why the Duke of So does that for me. If you get caught in a villa owned by a duke, the duke will also be charged.\u201dCompared to just pretending not to see her, it was too much kindness.\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2026\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201dNassar opened his mouth.Even after waiting patiently, nothing came out.\u201cI know. Let\u2019s pretend I ran away. I will be grateful for the kindness of the Little Duke.\u201dWhatever the reason, Philomel was in no position to reconsider.\u201cBut I won\u2019t go to Avrydon\u2019s villa. Because I don\u2019t want to trouble the duchy.\u201dAnd Nassar may not have known, but his father, the Duke of Avrydon could not be trusted at all.As long as the real princess appeared, Philomel would just be an annoyance to the Duke.The person the Duke wanted as his son\u2019s mate was the princess, not Philomel.\u201cThen what are your plans for the future?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to go somewhere else as soon as we arrive in the imperial palace.\u201d\u201cWhere?\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t decided yet. I should think about it later. Anywhere away from the imperial palace is fine.\u201dI said so, but I was going to go back to Angelium and go to the Ma Tower.It was urgent, but time was running out to find a new place and leave. I was just reluctant to let Nasar know about this.\u2018I know he\u2019s a good person, but I can\u2019t fully trust him.\u2019Philomel peeked across the street.Nassar Avrydon.A man who had been a good fianc\u00e9 for close to ten years, but nothing more and nothing less.When they were young, they often ate together and played strange fortune-telling games, but that was also a thing of the past. Growing up, both Philomel and Nassar got busy, and their encounters dwindled drastically.\u2018In the end, this is the person who will become Ellencia\u2019s lover.\u2019I didn\u2019t hate him, but there was nothing good about being closer than necessary.Nassar, who looked sad for some reason, spoke resolutely.\u201cEven so, I would like to help Your Highness in some way on the way.\u201d\u201c\u2026do as you please.\u201dPhilomel replied so because she was no longer bothered to pay attention to him. I was tired when I decided on the plan.The sky outside the window was gloomy. It was already dawn.\u201cAre you tired? Close your eyes for a bit.\u201dAt Nasar\u2019s recommendation, I leaned back comfortably in the seat.Even if I closed my eyes, I couldn\u2019t fall asleep easily, maybe because of the tension. After tossing and turning a few times, Nasar\u2019s coat that was worn on her body flowed down.Nassar picked it up and covered it with Philomel. The hand that refines the shape was delicate enough to cover as much of the body as possible.\u201cI hope you rest in peace, even in your dreams.\u201dA whisper tickled my ear.The wind was overshadowed, and Philomel couldn\u2019t sleep a wink until dawn. I was so tired that I couldn\u2019t fall asleep.\u201cWe have arrived.\u201dAfter a few days, the scenery I saw before was no different from before.Since there was no need to take detours like Philomel, it was possible to cover it in one night. The carriage stopped near the hotel where the Duke was staying.\u201cThank you so far. I will not forget today\u2019s grace.\u201d\u201cAre you leaving right away? You must be hungry, so let me serve you breakfast.\u201d\u201cBecause I don\u2019t have much time. There\u2019s nothing nice about seeing us together.\u201d\u201c\u2026 That\u2019s a fair statement.\u201d\u201cOkay then\u201dI was going to break some money, but I was going to go to the telecommunications office and contact Lexion to come and pick me up.I thought about it in the carriage, but that was the fastest way to get to the magic tower.It would be nice if Lexion could use movement magic, but even if she couldn\u2019t, there would be at least one wizard who could.The sound of Nassar\u2019s words caught Philomel who was about to leave.\u201cWait a minute. I\u2019ll tell them to prepare something simple to eat as they go. Please don\u2019t refuse this.\u201dWhat should I do?It was true that I was hungry, so I was a little hesitant.The hotel where the Duke of Avrydon stayed was the best aristocrat-only hotel. It was also known for its delicious food.Without missing Philomel\u2019s hesitation, Nassar quickly instructed one of the knights who came with him.\u201cTell the hotel kitchen to wrap it well with a delicious, digestible, nutritious, but easy-to-eat and quick-prepared menu. It should taste light.\u201d\u201cYes, yes!\u201dConfused by the long and detailed order, the knight hurriedly ran into the hotel.\u2018You know I like plain food.\u2019For some reason, a corner of Philomel\u2019s chest ached, and she bit her lip.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Please just say anything. And again, if you tell me even the approximate destination, I can help somehow\u2026\u201dPhilomel cautiously opened her mouth.\u201cCould you lend me some money?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dPhilomel\u2019s face flushed a little with embarrassment.\u2018I\u2019m too hesitant to say this to my ex-fianc\u00e9!\u2019However, the face was ideal, and a slimmer wallet was a reality.Philomel had lived as frugally as possible for the past few days, but there weren\u2019t many gold coins left. She didn\u2019t know that maybe she didn\u2019t have enough money to rent a communication stone.\u201cAh, you are talking about money. That\u2026 because I don\u2019t have any money right now.\u201dNasar fumbled in his arms, it was unlike him.I understand, Traditionally, aristocrats often left the trivial tasks of exchanging small amounts of money to attendants.\u201cI\u2019ll borrow it from someone else and give it to you. Sir Aaron, give me all the money. When I return, I\u2019ll return it several times.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go that far!\u201dPhilomel politely dissuaded Nassar from trying to rip off another knight next to him.I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve shown you that I\u2019m incapacitated, forgave me\u201dPerhaps embarrassed, Nassar went red up to his neck.\u2018Is this your original personality?\u2019This is a fact that I did not know before when we were polite and exchanged routine conversations. It\u2019s no use trying to find out now.if, really if.\u2018If we had been open to each other a little longer, would we have been able to become friends?\u2019Philomel looked blankly at Nassar and thought.At that time, a man who appeared to be Avrydon\u2019s knight rushed out of the hotel.\u201cLittle Duke! We\u2019re in trouble!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cThe Emperor is here!\u201dPhilomel doubted her ears.Wait, wait, wait. What the hell is he saying?The blue-faced knight rambled.\u201cHe suddenly appeared a while ago, but strangely, there is no attendant\u2026 However, it certainly is His Majesty the Emperor. Guys like us have only met from afar, but that\u2019s for sure!\u201dBefore she could understand the knight\u2019s words, a large figure caught her eye.\u201cPhilomel.\u201dIt looks like a dot in the bright morning sky with black paint, but the presence of the whole world as if it were turning into the night with one black dot.It was Eustis.The Emperor, dressed in acupuncture like a man who had just jumped out of sleep, grabbed Philomel by the shoulder.\u201cWhere\u2026 where the hell have you been? Do you know how long I\u2019ve been looking for you?\u201dIt was an unrealistic sight, and Philomel\u2019s thoughts stopped.\u2018How could the Emperor be here?\u2019Even if the letter from Nassar had arrived early, he arrived at Saint-Gen as soon as it was received.How far is it from the capital to Saint-Gen, that would be impossible\u2026No. There is one way. The method used by Philomel to escape.It was movement magic.I had never heard of the Emperor being able to use movement magic, but he was the one who breathed divine power into the ring of red flames. There was nothing strange about him using it.My heart was beating so hard that I couldn\u2019t control it. I could feel the blood draining from my face.It\u2019s a real dead end now. I can\u2019t see any more holes to get out of. The execution was repeated thousands of times, tens of thousands of times in my head.I\u2019ll die.\u201c\u2026 Philomel? What\u2019s wrong? You don\u2019t look well.\u201d\u201cYour Highness? Where are you sick\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s strange.Eustis and Nassar\u2019s voices grew quieter. It turned into a hum and seemed to be saying something, but I couldn\u2019t understand it.The view was also whitened from the corner. My body was as heavy as wet cotton, so I shivered regardless of my limbs.I have to run away quickly.Soon the world turned upside down. No, Philomel\u2019s body was leaning.\u201cYour Highness\u201d\u201cPhilomel!\u201dInstead of the surface of the hard and cold floor, a hard but warm feeling wrapped around the whole body.Finally, Philomel\u2019s consciousness fell into darkness.* * *\u201cPhilomel!\u201dThe Emperor embraced the body as it collapsed. The face in his arms was pitifully pale.\u201cPhilomel, Philomel! Wake up!\u201dThe emperor continued to call out her name and brushed Philomel\u2019s face, but her eyes would not open.Nassar\u2019s heart felt like it was racing.\u201cI\u2019ll call the doctor!\u201dHe realized the obvious fact that he had to call a doctor at such times after hearing the knight cry.Before the knight even stepped forward, a dazzling light flowed from the Emperor and enveloped Philomel as well as him.And in the place where the two of them were, nothing was left. Just like when the Emperor appeared and disappeared with the movement magic.Nassar stared blankly at his hand.The hands sticking out of the Emperor\u2019s arms were too white, like her face. I wanted to hold that hand, but I couldn\u2019t. I felt guilty that I dared to touch it.Eventually, the unreachable warmth vanished in vain.Nassar clenched his fist so hard that his fingernails dug into his skin.It was obvious where the Emperor would take his fianc\u00e9e.\u201cUh, I\u2019m sure they were here.\u201dI looked around for the knight that brought a resident doctor to the hotel.\u201cThey\u2019re gone.\u201dOut of his reach.\u201cWe are heading to the capital.\u201d\u201cRight now?\u201d\u201cYes. Are there any wizards from Avrydon whom we brought that can use movement magic right now?\u201dIt was last night that the wizards, who had exhausted their mana in the process of moving to their former lives, rested at a hotel.\u201cQuickly pack up\u2026 No, I will leave first, so you guys should come later.\u201dIt would be impossible to fully recover in one night, but only Nassar would be able to move it.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 Actually\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cThe wizards all left early this morning. The Duke sent a message that he needed them for other work, so\u2026\u201d\u201cDamn it.\u201dHis father, the Duke of Avrydon, was skeptical about finding the missing princess from the beginning.Even if he didn\u2019t oppose it outright, he was dissatisfied with his son\u2019s actions.\u201cDon\u2019t waste your time and focus on your work.\u201dThe day she disappeared, another princess appeared.The Duke, who was attending a political meeting and witnessed a girl who suddenly appeared, seemed convinced that the girl was real. She looked a lot like the dead empress.Still, Nassar did not believe it. Because the princess he served was only one.\u201cShall we ask other wizards in the city? As soon as the wizard guild opens the door, I\u2019ll come running\u2026\u201d\u201cAll right, I\u2019m going to the Mage Tower. There are more capable wizards in the tower.\u201dYou can\u2019t be idle. You need someone who can take not only yourself but also others and go to the capital at one time.\u201cBring a new horse instead of a horse that runs all night. The fastest one.\u201d\u201cHow do you eat breakfast? You spent the night in the carriage, too?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dI felt like I couldn\u2019t stand it without seeing the face of the person who was fine right away.Nassar mounted his horse and took the reins.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Where did you go\u2026\u201d\u201cCall the palace! Hurry up!\u201dPollan recognized the person he held in his arms. The princess who had disappeared a few days ago was limp. The Count, who quickly understood the situation, called someone to the palace.Eustis, who put Philomel on the bed, couldn\u2019t stand the moment when the courtier arrived, and anxiously moved around, impatiently.\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, the kid looks like is going to die, so why aren\u2019t they coming sooner!\u201dThe Countess secretly checked the princess\u2019s condition. Her complexion was not good, but her breathing was steady and her pulse was even. She thought it was an exaggeration that she looked dead, but she kept her mouth shut, afraid of the Emperor\u2019s spirit.He arrived in a matter of minutes, but the court physician, who had been unfairly criticized for being slow, examined her princess.\u201cShe just passed out from accumulated fatigue and lack of sleep. She must have been overly stressed in that state\u2026. If she takes a break and replenishes her nutrition, she will soon regain her energy. I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\u201cShe looks like this because of stress?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Did she hear some shocking news or saw a stressful scene before passing out\u2026?\u201dConsidering the time lag between the disappearance and reappearance of the emperor after hearing the report from the Duke of Avrydon, the cause of stress was due to high anger. The Emperor\u2019s words, actions, or existence itself.He left, saying he would prepare medicine for when the princes woke up. One might be curious about the princess, who has been rumored lately, but the courtier showed no signs of being different. That was the way to survive for a long time in the silent battlefield, the imperial palace.\u201cI\u2019ll prepare a bed in another room. Your Majesty will rest there too.\u201dPollan lowered his voice, trying not to wake the sleeping princess.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll stay here.\u201d\u201cIt was only yesterday that you collapsed, and didn\u2019t you use movement magic twice? If you collapse again after that\u2026\u201d\u201cEven so it\u2019s okay.\u201dAs the Emperor waved his hand in irritation, Pollan had no choice but to back down. He was about to leave the room, but when he turned around, he saw Eustis pulling a chair and putting it beside the bed.Princess Philomel has returned. So the emperor and the imperial palace would return to their original form. Pollan happily walked down the aisle.* * *Loving the soft, smooth feel of the fabric, Philomel was buried under the blanket.\u2018What time is it? I have to get up, get dressed, and get ready for class.\u2019Really tired. She wanted to stay like that for a little while longer. But it didn\u2019t work. She had a routine that she had to perform every day. Besides, the economics\u2019 teacher she was having was pretty strict. If she was late for class, she\u2019d be dissatisfied with the year instructions.Her eyelids were unusually heavy, so she struggled to open her eyes.A familiar yet unfamiliar ceiling. She blinked her eyes a couple of times before realizing she wasn\u2019t in her room. Her bedding smelled of cool, heavy wood.\u2018This is the incense that comes from the body of the emperor.\u2019 Her head was all jumbled up, so she couldn\u2019t remember why she was there.She slightly turned her head, and what came into her field of vision was Eustis\u2019 face with his eyes closed.\u2018Wait, Eustis\u2026?\u2019Philomel bounced up and looked around at her false-father. That was the bedchamber of the emperor, and Philomel was lying on his bed.It all came to Philomel\u2019s mind. She ran away, met her biological father, was put in jail, and went to live with Nassar. She unexpectedly encountered Eustis, who came looking for her and after that her memory was blank.She was so shocked that she seemed to have lost her mind, but she couldn\u2019t imagine the intermediate process leading up to the current situation. They must have moved to the imperial palace with the power of Eustis. But why was Philomel lying on the emperor\u2019s bed, while the owner of the bed was dozing in a chair? And that too, with the tip of her own filthy skirt clenched in her hand.In an instant, her pulse went blank.\u2018As long as I\u2019m captured, it doesn\u2019t matter where I am.\u2019Through the wide window, the image of the imperial palace where she was born and raised was reflected.Philomel\u2019s beautiful prison.Her brief escape ended in vain. Even if she used her spirit and ran away, she was in the palm of the emperor\u2019s hand. The villainess couldn\u2019t change the given fate. Thinking about it made her feel better. It didn\u2019t change no matter what she tried, but the person who tried was stupid. She fooled around every day for seven years.\u201cPhilomel.\u201dPhilomel had no motivation whatsoever, she was dazed and she wais sitting on the bed when her name was called.\u201cYour Majesty.\u201dDark blue eyes stared at Philomel.\u201cYou\u2019re up. How are you feeling?\u201dSeeing him rubbing his brows as if he was tired, it seemed that Eustis should lie down rather than herself.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll get out of the way, so your Majesty can sleep here.\u201d\u201cNot. You lie down some more.\u201dPhilomel complied. She had no particular reason. She didn\u2019t want to roll her head as she struggled to live any longer. Everything about her became a nuisance.Compared to Philomel, who emptied her head, Eustis had a distraught face.\u201cWhy\u2026 did you leave?\u201dAfter a while, he asked something obvious so Philomel answered without hesitation.\u201cBecause I am not your real daughter.\u201dShe, he, and everybody must already know, but for some reason he put on a shocked expression. As if interrogated, several questions followed. The answers spilled out of Philomel\u2019s lips. Surprisingly, since she had let go of everything, Eustis wasn\u2019t as scary as before.\u201cDid you write that letter?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d\u201cHere and there around the neighborhood where I was born.\u201dAbout her going to Angelium, she didn\u2019t want to tell him much. It was almost certain that it would be found out anyway if Nassar officially reported it, but that was just how Philomel felt.\u201cWhy did you go there?\u201d\u201cI just wanted to go there one more time. When I visited with the Duke of Avrydon before, I thought the city was very pretty.\u201dShe was red, and she wasn\u2019t even lying.\u201cHas there been any change in the meantime?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s a change\u2026\u201d\u201cMeeting a monster, or being seriously ill.\u201d\u201cNo big deal.\u201dAlthough confronted with the secret of her birth and slapped for the first time in her life\u2026 Ah, being imprisoned was a different experience for her.\u201cThen why does His Highness\u2019 face look so bad? He\u2019s very skinny.\u201d\u201cThe bed and food must have been bad.\u201d\u2018Even if I had a hard time going out, why did he lose weight?\u2019She was just a little curious, very little Eustis, who had washed his face dry, looked serious.\u201cPhilomel. Just because you\u2019re not my daughter doesn\u2019t mean you have to leave. Even if we\u2019re not blood related, you\u2019re my daughter.\u201dIt was an incomprehensible story. How could she be a daughter when she wasn\u2019t blood related? There were people who were family even without blood ties, such as adoptive families, but Eustis and Philomel did not have that. Philomel was nothing more than a cuckoo\u2019s egg, which Catherine pushed into that stranger\u2019s nest. The original egg was pushed out of her nest and she pretends to be the offspring of her parent bird. Technically, she wasn\u2019t pushed out by Philomel, but as a result, Ellencia grew up separated from her parents.She was no different.As she looked at him with eyes seeking an explanation, Eustis solemnly declared.\u201cI will register you.\u201dRegistration.Philomel quietly chewed that word. He meant to adopt her as his adopted daughter. Why was he so inconclusive? Didn\u2019t his soul come out?\u201c\u2026why?\u201d\u201cBecause you are my daughter.\u201dShe heard the answer, but her doubts only grew. Her head hurt again. After giving up on everything at best, she was willing to accept any ending, even if it was death. However, something completely unexpected came out.Philomel first asked the most urgent question.\u201cUm. So\u2026 you have no intention of killing me?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Why would I kill you?\u201dEustis asked in dismay. As if Philomel\u2019s question was nonsense.\u201cThen why did you try to find me like that?\u201d\u201cBecause you suddenly disappeared.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t want to find out and punish me, did you?\u201d\u201cIf you didn\u2019t commit a crime, why would I punish you? The person who switched you and Ellencia was your mother, not you.\u201dIt was a fact, so there was nothing to accept. It was insanely awkward to hear the right words come out of Eustis\u2019 mouth.\u201cIf you\u2019re not trying to punish me, why are you looking for me so much?\u201d\u201cBecause my daughter was gone.\u201dShe wondered if she had heard it wrong, so she asked one more time and got an even more shocking answer.\u2018Daughter? Did he just call me his daughter?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His Majesty\u2019s daughter is Ellencia.\u201d\u201cYou and Elencia are my daughters.\u201d\u201cNo. Only Ellencia is His Majesty\u2019s daughter. Only Ellencia is the daughter of Her Majesty the Empress.\u201d\u201cIt has nothing to do with her except that she gave birth to her. I have always regarded you as a daughter, and I will continue to consider you a daughter.\u201d\u201cShe gave birth to her, so she\u2019s her child, so why doesn\u2019t that have anything to do with it?\u201d\u201cEven if blood isn\u2019t mixed\u2026\u201dOnly after repeating similar questions and answers several times with only the words changed, Philomel realized that he was serious. After all, Eustis had no reason to lie to Philomel. Because he has nothing to gain. Still, she couldn\u2019t believe it, so she kept asking.Now, even if her mouth hurted, she had to admit it. Nassar was right when he said that the emperor was looking for Philomel out of concern.\u201cSo, I will enlist you. You are, and will always be, my daughter, the princess of the Belerov Empire.\u201d the Emperor added.\u201c\u2026 I am grateful for considering me as a daughter, but I do not wish to be registered. Even if I am innocent, I am the daughter of a sinner. I don\u2019t deserve to be a princess. It is a virtue that will charge me with guilt\u2026\u201d\u201cYou deserve to be a princess.\u201d\u201cThe ministers will object.\u201d\u201cI promise you. No one will object.\u201dEustis glared at her as if he would not let him go if there was such a guy.\u2018That\u2019s because they will be scared and won\u2019t be able to express it in front of your face!\u2019Philomel swallowed her words and turned her head away.\u201cWhat does other people\u2019s opinions have to do with us building a family? The important thing is your opinion and mine.\u201dEustis continued to fire at her.\u201c\u2026 What about Ellencia? Will she want to be my sister?\u201dPhilomel asked quietly. Being his family means being a family with Ellencia too.\u201c\u2026 she said he wants to get along with you when you come back.\u201dOnly then did Eustis calmly answer.\u201cGetting along and being a family are two different things.\u201d\u201cI will not force you two to have friendship.\u201dTo think he would treat Elencia and herself fairly. It was so absurd that she was about to laugh. Why was he trying to catch Philomel by saying such absurd things? Was it even worth it to her?\u201cYou say that you will treat her the same as your fake daughter\u2026 Elencia will be sad if she hears it.\u201d\u201cPhilomel, why do you keep worrying about other people\u2019s reactions? As I said before, you are overly conscious of others. Tell me your honest opinion.\u201dWhen Philomel didn\u2019t say anything, his expression darkened.\u201c\u2026Is there anything you don\u2019t want to be enrolled in?\u201cMe?\u201dDid she hate it?She was embarrassed because she had never assumed it before. The reason she tried to look good was to reassure everyone until she ran away, and to receive even the weakest punishment when caught. She didn\u2019t expect that she would be able to become a daughter just because she worked hard. After all, his daughter was Ellencia, and she was a position that Philomel did not dare to step over.She questioned herself. Did she want to be Eustis\u2019 foster daughter? In fact, she was skeptical that the emperor considered her as his daughter. He might have mistaken the crush of \u2018a person who listens well and likes you quite a bit\u2019 as affection for your child. The previous emperor was a heartless father who competed with his children to preserve his power, and the imperial palace at the time was a silent battlefield.In <Princess Elencia>, it was stated that Eustis never felt a deep affection for Isabella, his wife. He has just met Ellencia as well, so he may not be able to tell the difference between a family bond and a shallow crush. Still, she didn\u2019t know if it would be good if she looked at the result alone, because her life was saved and she was not going to be imprisoned right away.\u2018Yes. Let\u2019s accept it.\u2019Once accepted, let\u2019s leave this place again when the time comes when he becomes so infatuated with his own daughter that he loses interest in her foster daughter. That was a reasonable decision. Except for Philomel\u2019s dislike, it didn\u2019t matter. That\u2019s when she opened her mouth to answer that she had come to that conclusion and accepted the registration.\u201c\u2026I do not like it.\u201dWords that were different from what she thought came out of her mouth. Having said that, Philomel herself was the most surprised.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be your daughter.\u201d\u2018Was she crazy? What if he changes his mind to kill her because she keeps getting on his nerves? Just say you\u2019ll accept it!\u2019However, the things buried deep in her chest poured out when she opened the stopper. Philomel couldn\u2019t stop this flow. She gave names to the remnants of emotions she had been piling up.\u201cI haven\u2019t considered you as my father since I grew up, and I don\u2019t even remember being treated like a daughter.\u201dAs she spoke, she realized she could no longer live like she had for the past seven years.\u201cYou alone may have considered me your daughter in your heart, but life here has been hell for me.\u201dFrom around the age of nine when she picked up the book, or even before that.\u201cYou said you wanted me to live as if I were dead. So I just lived as if I were dead.\u201dShe had to live as quietly as if she was dead. She killed her emotions, put on a mask, and left behind only an outer shell.\u201cDon\u2019t hold me now, Your Majesty.\u201dYour Majesty, not father. The word \u201cYour Majesty,\u201d which Philomel deliberately pronounced with great force, resounded hollowly. Eustis\u2019 interior shook like a bonfire in front of a strong wind.The past 7 years of working hard to get his favor went back to nothing in an instant. However, the relief was greater than the worry or regret. She didn\u2019t know what was so shocking, but the emperor\u2019s face was contorted with shock. He must have never expected that he would be rejected because of his pride.That was an awesome profit. There was the sound of a chair being pushed. Eustis jumped up, turned his back on Philomel, and stood facing the wall.\u2018Was he saying he didn\u2019t want to see her face now?\u2019\u201c\u2026 At that time, that\u2019s the story.\u201dHe seemed to remember the time Philomel said. For Philomel, it was a turning point in her life, but for Eustis, it would have been just a passing word.\u201cYou kept it in your heart.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cSorry.\u201dFor a moment, Philomel doubted whether it was because of her hearing ability. Was he sorry? That Eustis was apologizing?\u201cAt that time\u2026 no. Anything I say will be an excuse.\u201dA strange conversation continued, with one person looking at the wall and the other looking at the other person\u2019s back.\u201cI\u2019ll formally apologize again later. And think about registering again.\u201d\u201cI just said no\u2026\u201d\u201cOne year.\u201dSuddenly, a specific time period was presented.\u201cEven if you leave, can\u2019t you leave after staying here for just one year?\u201dsHE couldn\u2019t understand what he was talking about, so when SHE fell silent, the other person seemed to understand in a different way.\u201cIf you hate 1 year, how about 10 months?\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u20268 months?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cOkay. Six months.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201d\u201cNo. I can\u2019t give more than that.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that kind of problem\u2026\u201d\u201cYes. Three months.\u201dIt was a strange bargain indeed.\u201cAnyway, take a break and think about it slowly.\u201d\u201cYour majesty. I am\u2026\u201d\u201cYou need a break. I\u2019ll get out of the way, so make yourself comfortable.\u201d\u201cA little bit about me\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s long past time to eat. I\u2019ll tell you to come see the table.\u201dWhether he wanted to hear Philomel\u2019s answer or not, Eustis, who had kept him speechless, quickly walked away. More than that, Eustis\u2019 absurd proposal caught her heart. To suddenly stay at the imperial palace after the story of her death.\u2018Are you serious?\u2019No. It\u2019s not a big deal to say that he is sorry. Philomel tried to get the emperor\u2019s back figure out of her head.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There\u2019s no way that the news of the fake princess that spread across the country didn\u2019t reach only within the imperial palace.\u201cI\u2019ll set up a simple table so you can eat in bed.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m immobile, and it\u2019s okay to eat at the table.\u201d\u201cPlease give up your will. Your Highness needs absolute rest now.\u201dIt was clear patient treatment. In addition, all the food prepared was nutritious.\u201cWe will go back so that Your Highness can rest in peace. Call me anytime if you need anything.\u201dThe maids finished their duties and left the room before they had time to ask for any information they were curious about. She didn\u2019t want to be indebted to the imperial palace, no after she had just declared that she would leave\u2026 but then she growled.She was too hungry for that. Come to think of it, she had an empty stomach after the loaf of bread, soup, and spoon she ate at the dining room last night. She poured out the words she wanted to say, and it was such a cool feeling that her appetite returned after a long time.\u2018I don\u2019t know. Let\u2019s think about it after filling the stomach first.\u2019Philomel picked up her fork. After she finished eating, the chief servant brought her medicine this time. She carries the fruit of the World Tree, which even Philomel knew well.\u201cI\u2019m not a patient\u2026\u201dFainting was because she was surprised by the car that had been disturbing her sleep for several days, and it was not a problem with her body. But the chief chamberlain didn\u2019t seem to think so.\u201cShe\u2019s a patient. Her face has become half-shaven. Oh, she\u2019s very thin, but only her skeleton remains like this.\u201dAlthough she had lost some weight due to his escape life, that was a clear exaggeration.\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how well you walk around.\u201dTo the chief chamberlain, Philomel seemed to be in critical condition, not knowing when she would collapse. With his worried gaze, she eventually took the medicine and drank a cup of tea after dinner. As a result, her body was very stretched. She had lived as a noble princess all her life, and her body screamed of joy after suffering from an uncomfortable bed and tasteless food for the past few days. She said that the human heart was cunning, and after she sat down her appetite, she longed for a bath and clean clothes.She looked around at the dress she was wearing. She hadn\u2019t changed for days and was even dirty from lying on the floor in her cell. When she finally looked at the condition of the bed that she had covered with the clothes, she was very dirty.\u201c\u2026This is expensive.\u201dThe one-of-a-kind bedding that fairies made for the emperor of the empire over several years. The quilt was elaborately embroidered with the myth of Belerov\u2019s founding. She was also told that she was invaluable in money, as she was even blessed by the Fairy Queen herself. Fearing that it would not be erased, she tried to rub it with her clean sleeve, but only spread her dirt.\u2026 The son of the sun god Beleron and the founding emperor\u2019s face became mottled.\u201cI don\u2019t know! I didn\u2019t lie down because I wanted to lie down.\u201dPhilomel gave up her fuss and lay down again.\u2018\u2026I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to kill myself with this?\u2019Philomel shook her head and decided to think about the future direction. She was really glad she didn\u2019t die. She\u2019s a nonsense cow who says she stays on, here\u2019s\u2026Bang!But then, without knocking, the open door made a loud noise as it hit the wall.\u201cDad! I\u2019m here!\u201dHer beautiful golden hair rippled. She was Ellencia.\u201cLet\u2019s continue playing backgammon, which we stopped doing last time!\u201dPhilomel and Ellencia\u2019s eyes met.\u201cO\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dEllencia, who had turned into rabbit eyes, strode forward.\u201cOh my God! Philomel, right? When did you come?\u201d\u201c\u2026 This morning. It\u2019s been a while. Princess Ellencia.\u201dPhilomel responded by raising her words to Ellencia. It was revealed that she was a fake princess, so she was the true one.\u201cYou\u2019re fine! You don\u2019t know how worried he was when he heard that you were missing.\u201dEllencia approached Philomel and smiled as if she were meeting a long-lost friend of hers. That may have been natural to the kind Elencia, but it was awkward to herself.\u201cThanks. Why are you so worried about me?\u201dPhilomel felt ashamed of her own appearance. Her clothes were dirty and her hair was messy. Standing in front of Eustis, she was unconscious, but for some reason she wanted to show Ellencia that she was okay. Maybe it was because she was in the exact opposite position of her previous encounter with a country girl as the princess.\u201cAre you going to live here now?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that\u2026\u201dAs she slurred her words, Ellencia looked around her head without digging further.\u201cBy the way, where is Daddy?\u201d\u201cWell, it looks like he was going somewhere.\u201dRather, it was Philomel who wanted to ask. She was at a loss as to how to explain where the owner was going and how she was occupying her private room.\u201cWhat is that?\u201dPhilomel pointed to the object Ellencia was holding and turned her words away. She saw a plate and a box made of paper.\u201cOh, this? That\u2019s great! Will Philomel play dice with me?\u201dShe was led by Ellencia\u2019s hand and sat down at a table on one side of her room. It was the table often used by Eustis and Philomel for teatime.\u201cHave you ever played backgammon?\u201dThe late Elencia took out dice and small pieces from the table spread out on her table.\u201cI\u2019ve never tried it, but I know roughly what it is.\u201dShe watched her maids play a few times to pass the time. It was a way to move his pieces on the board as much as the number that came out by rolling the dice. The position of the horse was lowered or raised according to each phrase written on each of the several spaces drawn on the board. All started as serfs, and whoever reached the emperor first was the victor.\u201cIt was a game I enjoyed passing on when I was at the wedding house, but when I came here, a maid saw me bored and brought it to me. Now, my dad or nanny plays with it.\u201d\u201cA nanny?\u201d\u201cShe was my mother\u2019s nanny too! I heard that Philomel was also raised by her nanny.\u201dOne more reason to leave the imperial palace was added.\u201cLast time I was with my dad, something urgent happened and he left. So I came today\u2026\u201d\u201cHe will be back soon.\u201dIt was a scene in the novel, but the emperor playing a game that would be played by commoner children was not well drawn. It was a little funny to see the real emperor play a game of targeting the emperor.\u2018I have to do well to maintain my current status, and if I don\u2019t do it, I will lose my status.\u2019Anyway, the two started playing.She didn\u2019t know why she ended up playing dice with Ellencia in the imperial palace. She couldn\u2019t help but think that she was caught up in a sunny attitude. However, it was not a bad feeling because the first game she played was quite fun.\u2018I wanted to try it too when the maids were playing.\u2019She always acted like I wasn\u2019t very interested, but she really wanted to play together. The two of them alternately rolled the dice, going ahead and behind, advancing the horse. It was a dead-end. Philomel moved her horse, and on the arrival column, it was written, \u2018You will enter the palace as a maid.\u2019She changed her job from a merchant to a lady-in-waiting. Among the nobility, only those with guaranteed identity could become maids, and they were in their own middle-upper class.\u201cPhilomel, is she going to be a handmaid?\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s right. It\u2019s the princess\u2019 turn next.\u201d\u201cNot for play, but for real. Do you want to be my maid?\u201dPhilomel, who was moving her words, raised her head and looked at Ellencia.\u201cSince there are things I still don\u2019t know, I want Philomel to teach me a lot. And I\u2019m worried about Philomel. She\u2019s been living in the imperial palace for a while, but now you had no place to go. So live here as my maid. Yes?\u201dHer innocent face made Philomel speechless.\u201c\u2026I just decline because he wants to take care of my situation. I do\u2026 I have no intention of remaining in the imperial palace.\u201dPhilomel replied, trying to stay calm. The fact that she became Ellensia\u2019s maid made her goosebumps. It wasn\u2019t that she hated maid work or was overly proud. It was because becoming Ellencia\u2019s handmaid was the development of <Princess Ellencia>.When Ellensia appears and it is revealed that she was a fake, \u2018Philomel\u2019 was in danger of being punished for impersonating the princess. However, Ellensia, who took pity on her teeth, appealed to her emperor for mercy, and she went further and put her \u2018Pilomel\u2019, who should be kicked out, as her own handmaid. \u2018Pilo\u2019, served by her evil, repays her favor with her enemies, but her words.Even if she tried to escape, couldn\u2019t she escape her fate? Was it her fate to become Ellencia\u2019s handmaid even if she didn\u2019t want to? A cold fear spread through her chest.\u201cReally? Can\u2019t we just stay here? I\u2019ll take good care of you.\u201d\u201cI will only accept the heart of the princess.\u201d\u201c\u2026Chi, I got it. That\u2019s too bad.\u201dEllencia repeatedly did not recommend and rolled her dice handed to her by Philomel.The sound of the rolling dice rang strangely loud.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s different from the contents of the book.\u2019\u2018Philomel\u2019 could not give up the glory of the past and remained in the imperial palace, but she herself would not do that. In the first place, the position the emperor proposed was the princess, not the princess\u2019s maid. It must have been the words given to Ellencia for Philomel. She was a child who cares about others and has a lot of remnants.She thought, \u2018She\u2019s more of a mouthful than him. This human didn\u2019t explain anything to Ellencia.\u2019As she recalled the face of Eustis, who had been talking about adopting her, her fingers tightened as she picked up her words.In the end, the victory in the game went to Philomel, who reached the position of emperor first. It was an ironic result considering the future of Ellensia, who would later ascend to the throne as the sole heir. Even though they had only played one game, it was already close to night.\u201cWhy hasn\u2019t Daddy come yet?\u201dEllencia, carrying her board and her horse, looked at her watch and asked.Philomel said, \u201cIt seems that things are getting late. The princess and I should go away now.\u201dUsually at that time, there was no business that would keep the emperor tied up late. Especially in the case of Eustis, who preferred to work in his bedroom rather than his office.\u2018I\u2019m in the bedroom, so he can\u2019t come.\u2019The last time she saw him, it seemed that he didn\u2019t want to hear Philomel\u2019s answer. When they came out of the bedroom, Elencia clapped her hands cheerfully.\u201cOh, let\u2019s go to my dad!\u201d\u201cHuh? Now, wait a minute\u2026!\u201dShe grabbed Philomell by the wrist and started running, only to be dragged away.\u201cHe\u2019ll be in the office!\u201d\u201cWhat are you going to do with His Majesty the Emperor?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to ask him to let Philomel be my handmaid!\u201d\u201cI beg your pardon? But I\u2019m fine!\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say anything. You\u2019re afraid Dad won\u2019t approve, right? I tell you, Dad will listen!\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s not like that!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Leave everything to me!\u201dThey couldn\u2019t communicate at all, as if they weren\u2019t using the same language.Strength was no joke than it looks. It was hard to shake off her hand. Maybe it was because she grew up running through mountains and fields, but her strength was different from Philomel.\u201cOh, princesses! You can\u2019t run! You\u2019ll get hurt!\u201dThe courtiers she encountered on her way stopped her, but Ellencia only hesitated for a moment but did not stop.\u201cDad! I\u2019m here!\u201dThe door to the emperor\u2019s office was violently opened. The emperor was sitting at his desk signing papers.\u201cEllensia, how many times have you been asked to knock\u2026\u201dHe found Philomel behind Elencia.\u201cWhat are you two doing together?\u201d\u201cThat is\u2026\u201d\u201cDad, please! Please allow Philomel to become my handmaid!\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes. I feel so sorry for Philomel, because she has to leave the imperial palace, which is like her home. If she becomes my maid, she won\u2019t have to leave, and the work isn\u2019t difficult either. So please allow it. I\u2019ll take care of it, so there won\u2019t be any problems.\u201dThe Emperor\u2019s gaze shifted from her daughter to Philomel. He seemed to mean roughly, \u2018I don\u2019t understand what this means, so you can explain it for me.\u2019Even Philomel was like that, she had no choice but to repeat what Elencia said to her in a coherent way.\u201cSig\u2026\u201dEustis sighed deeply and pressed the back of his pen to his temple. The emperor rose from his seat and approached Elencia.\u201cSo did Philomel accept your offer?\u201d\u201cYes? That\u2019s not the case, but if father approves\u2026\u201d\u201cNo. I do not intend to accept it.\u201dPhilomel shook her head resolutely.\u201cWhat are you going to do by begging me to do something that the person concerned didn\u2019t agree to? Is it what you want to do by forcing Philomel to be your maid?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cEllensia, no matter how you grew up, you are now a princess. Bring me a ridiculous problem and\u2026\u201d\u201cSob\u2026\u201dThe sound of sobbing stopped the rebuking words.\u201cSorry, sorry.\u201dTears flowed down Ellencia\u2019s cheeks.\u201cUgh, I\u2019m sorry\u2026 I\u2019m lacking a lot\u2026 I let my dad down.\u201dEven the emperor became embarrassed as if there was no business in front of his crying daughter.\u201cDon\u2019t cry. The imperial family shouldn\u2019t show tears recklessly. And apologize. I\u2019m not the one to do it.\u201d\u201cDad\u2026\u201d\u201cHurry.\u201dUnable to withstand the awkward atmosphere, Philomel intervened.\u201cI\u2019m fine. The princess must have made a mistake because she was too concerned about me.\u201dWhen she suddenly became involved in someone else\u2019s uncomfortable family affairs, she just wanted to quickly settle things down and go back. Besides, she knew what would happen if she received an apology from Ellencia, who was loved by the whole world.\u201c\u2026 If you are fine, then.\u201dEustis agreed with her hesitantly, then tapped Ellencia on the shoulder with his awkward hand.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about Philomel\u2019s future. She\u2019s a child who can arrange a place for herself. If I register her, she\u2019ll stay in the imperial palace forever.\u201d\u201c\u2026Are you going to register her? Does Dad like Philomel?\u201dShe lifted her head, as Ellencia asked him to accept her.\u201cYes.\u201dEustis, noticing Mel\u2019s stinging gaze, added an afterword to her.\u201cOnly if she accepted it.\u201dAt that point, just when she decided to definitely reject the story of her registration, Ellensia turned around.\u201cAre we going to be sisters then?\u201dEllencia laughed with her tears still on her face.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t even know there was such a way\u2026 From now on, let\u2019s get along well.\u201dThe lamplight cast a deep female shadow on her face. It was the emperor who sorted out the situation.\u201cAnyway, it\u2019s getting late. Both of you, go back now.\u201d\u201cYes. Good night, Dad.\u201dEllensia, who replied cheerfully as if she would leave at any moment, stared at the emperor\u2019s face.\u201c\u2026?\u201dShe gestured to the puzzled Eustis to bow his head. Just as she asked, his head was lowered, and her small lips touched the emperor\u2019s cheek.\u201cHehe. Good night kiss!\u201dLeaving Eustis and Philomel, who were hardened like statues, Ellencia left with her guns.\u201c\u2026I can\u2019t get used to that child\u2019s sense of distance at all.\u201dPhilomel felt the same way. She knew from reading the book that the relationship between father and daughter was so sweet, but seeing it in front of her eyes was a different feeling. If it\u2019s Philomel, even if a knife goes into her throat, she wouldn\u2019t do anything like that.\u201cI will apologize on behalf of Elencia. I will teach her well.\u201d said the emperor.\u201cYes, well. It\u2019s okay.\u201dThis reaction was somewhat unexpected. What should she say, in the book, he was a father who was obsessed with his daughter and lost his mind. From what she just watched, it seemed to be far from that. She wondered if there was something she didn\u2019t know about.Philomel glanced at his profile and quit thinking.\u2018What does it matter?\u2019Whatever is between the two, what does that mean? It was someone else\u2019s business anyway.\u201cYour majesty. These are the words you said during the day.\u201dEustis put the pen he was holding down on the desk as if tossing it.\u201cI told Countess Deles that I originally arranged for you to stay in your room. It would be more comfortable there than in my bedroom. I have to stop too. Then rest.\u201dHe spat it out like a rapid-fire cannon, and then hurriedly covered his back and avoided the seat. He looked at Philo and turned. He glanced at the papers on the desk, but didn\u2019t even bother signing. In the first place, it was not so urgent that the emperor had to deal with it until late at night. He had no choice but to go to his room.\u2018When I left, he thought I would never come back.\u2019She looked around to see if she could run away right now, and she saw the courtiers wandering around the palace infrequently. As if they had been well educated, they politely bowed their heads without looking suspiciously at the fake princess who suddenly disappeared and appeared. However, in the corner of her field of vision, they were watching Philomel. If she tried to run again they would move to stop her.The second run away didn\u2019t seem easy, so her shoulders feel heavy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You haven\u2019t said a word to me, who\u2019s been with you for a long time!\u201d\u201c\u2026sorry. I couldn\u2019t speak.\u201d\u201cNo, no. Just being back is enough. I was worried that the princess might be wrong\u2026\u201dThe Countess sniffed and hugged Philomel tightly.\u201cWelcome back. Really.\u201dThe Countess\u2019s body and her voice were trembling. The hospitality, which was much more intense than expected, was a bit embarrassing, but Philomel slowly patted her on the back.\u201cI\u2019m back.\u201dBut the Countess was not the only one who had been waiting for Philomel until this late hour.\u201cPrincess, I wanted to see you!\u201d\u201cI knew you would come back.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you leaving again? If you want to go, you must tell us.\u201dPhilomel struggled to calm her maids, who each had their own words to say.\u201cYou! I know you\u2019re happy, but what are you doing holding onto a tired person?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201dAt the Countess\u2019 scolding, her maids bowed their heads.\u201cDon\u2019t reprimand them too much.\u201dPhilomel stopped the Countess in a good mood. After soaking in the bath water they prepared, she came out and changed into clean clothes, feeling very refreshed. In the meantime, the maids had gone and only the countess was in the room.\u201cThe Countess should go and get some rest.\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m going to spend the night here. Here, I\u2019ve brought a pastime.\u201dSitting in an armchair, the lady held up her knitting. Philomel seemed to know how she felt about staying by her side, so she didn\u2019t tell her to go again. They sat on chairs by the fire and waited for her wet hair to dry.\u201cPrincess.\u201dSuddenly, Countess Deles opened her mouth.\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dPhilomel answered quietly.\u201cI won\u2019t ask why you left. A lot of other people have already asked. Instead, promise me one thing. Promise to never leave without a word again. Just let me know and then go.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes. I promise.\u201dPhilomel hesitated for a moment before answering with a nod of her head. When she left, she was the one she cared about the most, so she had no choice but to do it even though she knew it was a difficult promise to keep. To be honest, she was stunned that the Countess and her maids cared and thought of her so much. The time they spent together was a lot, so she wondered if she would remind her from time to time, but she never thought it would be that much.It was clear that those who were closest to Philomel were in her worst position because of her own disappearance. What should she name that feeling of feeling sorry for them but slightly happy?Meow.At that moment, she was awakened from my thoughts by the sound she heard outside.Meow, meow.The crying didn\u2019t stop at once, but the sound of scratching the window was also heard.\u201cDid a stray cat sneak in?\u201dThe Countess rose from her seat and opened the terrace door slightly.Shush.Something like a small ball of hair broke into the room in an instant.\u201cEh, oh my God!\u201d\u201cOhhhh.\u201dIt was a cat. The cat passed the frightened Countess and approached Philomel.\u201cSo beautiful.\u201dPhilomel admired the shiny white hair, which was unusual there. The cat friendly rubbed himself against Philomel\u2019s leg and she, gaining her courage, stroked his head. The hair was very fine, uncharacteristic of a street child. It didn\u2019t even look dirty.\u201cI don\u2019t know how he got here, but he seems to have eyes.\u201d\u201cHe doen\u2019t avoid people, so maybe he is a child with an owner?\u201d\u201cWell. If there is an owner, he\u2019d be looking for this guy diligently by now. Judging from his condition, he seems to have grown up quite cute.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a silver cat before.\u201dLooking closely, the cat\u2019s coat was silver, not white. The Countess, who had been gazing at Philomel, who could not take her eyes off the cat for a while, said.\u201cWill he be taken care of here until we find the owner?\u201d\u201cI\u2019d like to, but I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll be leaving again\u2026\u201dThe Countess\u2019s face blurred.\u201cAre you going to leave? Can\u2019t you just stay here with us?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not the princess. I can\u2019t stay here forever.\u201d\u201cHowever, how anxiously did His Majesty the Emperor search for the princess\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026You said that His Majesty was looking for me desperately?\u201dShe knew he found her with a strange light in his eyes, but the expression \u2018anxiety\u2019 didn\u2019t suit him.\u201cOf course.\u201dIt was difficult for her to splash her cold water on the Countess\u2019s unhesitating answer.\u201cWell. Although he said he wanted to register me in the family tree.\u201d\u201cReally? So how did you answer?\u201d\u201cI declined, but he told me to reconsider it a little\u2026\u201d\u201cSay yes!\u201dShe cried out and covered her mouth with her hands.\u201c\u2026 I apologize. That\u2019s a matter for the princess to decide, but I dared to be arrogant.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. You said that because you thought of me.\u201dIn the Countess\u2019 eyes, she would rather live comfortably with her there than leave the imperial palace, where Philomel was born and raised.\u201cI\u2019m presumptuous, but to tell you my opinion, I don\u2019t think life here is bad. I\u2019m confident that you\u2019ll do really well in the future.\u201d\u201cYou are only counting on what I\u2019ve done so far.\u201d\u201cAfter all, his real daughter is Princess Ellencia, so you won\u2019t do all the hard work, such as taking the successor classes or working. So, the princess can live comfortably from now on, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cThank you, but I\u2019m really fine with things as they are.\u201dSharing the seat of Ellencia would not be very comfortable, but she was grateful for the Countess\u2019s heart for thinking of her.Suddenly, Philomel\u2019s gaze turned to the cat still nearby. His ears perked up as if he were listening to the conversation between Philomel and the countess.\u2018Nonsense.\u2019It must be a misunderstanding, Philomel thought and ignored him.\u201cI\u2019m not really going anywhere, so just go take a break.\u201dEven while Philomel dried her hair and lay down on the bed, the Countess did not let go of her knitting in her hands.She said, \u201cI will only stay until the princess falls asleep.\u201dHer sleeping seemed to be the thing that would allow the Countess rest, so Philomel closed her eyes. However, perhaps because she had slept so much in the emperor\u2019s bedchamber, her dream did not come easily. She curled up and closed her eyes, as if the cat that had settled down in front of the stove was well prepared.The cat decided to sleep here for now. She was going to see if there\u2019s an owner tomorrow or someone to take care of him until they find his owner. The Countess asked softly to Philomel, who could not sleep.\u201cIs there anything that bothers you?\u201dShe was full of things that bothered her. Things in the future, situations that are strangely different from the novel. And Ellencia\u2019s dubious attitude. Even though it had only happened yesterday, her meeting with Le Guin and the secret of her birth felt like a distant past.\u201cIt\u2019s just a little complicated in my head.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t be of much help, but I can listen to any story, so if you don\u2019t mind, tell me. You know, just confiding in someone can make you feel better.\u201dHer heart was grateful, but most of her worries were of the kind that she couldn\u2019t confide in. Philomel brought out the least of which she would be fine with.\u201cUm\u2026 His Majesty and Princess Ellencia when I wasn\u2019t here\u2026 What happened between the two of them?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t have the chance to see those two up close either. What do you mean specifically?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say\u2026 For some reason, the two of them seem a little awkward.\u201dTo be precise, Eustis was awkward, and Elencia was very friendly.\u201cThat\u2019s natural.\u201d\u201cIt is?\u201d\u201cYes. The two of them are father and daughter, but in person, they met for the first time a few days ago. Wouldn\u2019t it be rather strange to be intimate?\u201d\u201c\u2026 But isn\u2019t there a kind of bond that is different from others between parents and their children, who are related by blood?\u201dYes, the bond she never had between herself and Eustis.Living in anxiety as if the floor would collapse at any moment, she had longed for a bond between blood ties. Neither Catherine nor Le Guin, with whom she shared blood, were people who could not give her that. The Countess paused her knitting and gazed at Philomel.\u201cPrincess. No, should I call you Philomel from now on?\u201d\u201cDo whatever you feel comfortable with.\u201d\u201cMiss Philomel, do you remember what I said about my daughter?\u201d\u201cOh, you said she went to study abroad and came back a while ago.\u201dShe seems to have been told that the daughter of the Countess went to college at Elita and that she majored in political science.\u201cWhoops. My daughter was a child who said she would marry her father when she grew up, but now she and her husband are very much in love. They were so awkward with each other whn she came back. They wouldn\u2019t say a word between them.\u201dThat was the first time she had heard of her family in detail.\u201cI believe that parent-child relationships are fundamentally no different from other human relationships. You have to put in time and effort to maintain a healthy, perfect relationship. Just as my daughter and her husband felt awkward because they have been apart for so long, I can relate to His Majesty the Emperor. Her Highness will be the same.\u201dCountess Deles, who began to move her hand again, showed years of experience in her eyes.\u201c\u2026is that so?\u201dWhen she heard the Countess\u2019s story, she couldn\u2019t know more.\u2018In the book, Ellensia Hwang became a special daughter to father as soon as they met.\u2019\u201cThat\u2019s what happens. I would like to introduce my family to Philomel. Hearing my story, I just want to see you all meet\u201d said the Countess of Deles, her eyes twinkling.\u201cMe?\u201dPhilomel gave a timid reply.\u201cIf you have to leave this place, why don\u2019t you stay at my house for a while?\u201d\u201cWhat about the handmaid\u2019s job?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re not there, I don\u2019t have to work.\u201d\u201cBut if you become Princess Ellencia\u2019s maid\u2026\u201d\u201cOh. Did I look like a person who easily changes the person I serve? It\u2019s a bit embarrassing.\u201d the Countess joked. \u201cMy daughter must have returned. It was Champil who was about to go down to the manor. It\u2019s not your fault, so don\u2019t worry, Miss Mel.\u201dPhilomel knew it was a lie for her. The Countess was very fond of her own work, and if Ellencia was original, she should become her maid of honor.\u201cEven though it\u2019s rural, it\u2019s a quiet and friendly place. If you come, you\u2019ll definitely like it.\u201dMaking the lullaby of her voice explaining her hometown softly, Philomel thought she may have been building a wall for herself for a long time. She thought that the Countess was Ellensia\u2019s person anyway, so she tried not to get closer than a certain level to her. She did not want to be the villainess who coveted the protagonist\u2019s things and was punished by her. Did she give up because she was intimidated by others besides Countess Deles?\u2018If there is no way, even now\u2026\u2019Meow.It was as if the cries of the cat was the sound of a sheep in her consciousness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since she was no longer a princess, she had no other schedule, let alone her successor\u2019s classes. However, the peaceful time was broken by shouts from outside.\u201cCome out! You vulgar thing!\u201dWhen Philomel opens the door and walks out, she has the first face she has seen in 7 years.\u201cNanny.\u201d\u201cOoh, you finally came out.\u201d\u201cNanny, please stop!\u201dNanny was wheezing in front of Philomel\u2019s quarters, and Ellencia was trying to stop her.\u201cWhere do you dare to be, are you still wandering around?\u201d shouted the nanny, rolling her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know how the Emperor might have lured you in, but I won\u2019t be beaten. If you have this much conscience, leave this place!\u201dWhen she heard from Ellencia that her nanny was in her imperial palace, she expected this situation to unfold.Philo Mel looked at the nanny with her impassive expression.\u201cI\u2019ll leave even if the nanny doesn\u2019t talk to me. So why don\u2019t you stop being noisy go back your way? People have eyes.\u201dThe courtiers around them watched the atmosphere with tense faces. Seeing all the affairs of the princess\u2019s nanny and her ex-princess, it seemed that they couldn\u2019t be quick to intervene.\u201cNow that I see it, you look just like your mother! Because of you and your mother, our poor Princess Ellensia has lived without seeing her father\u2019s face until now! Do you know?\u201d\u201cStop it because I\u2019m fine!\u201dEllensia held her nanny by the arm and tried to dissuade her, but it didn\u2019t help her much.\u201cWhat disrespect is this? I can\u2019t stop right now!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re out!\u201dCountess Delles, with her natural disposition, was no match for a nanny. Philomel let out a sigh of relief. Although she hated it, the nanny was her primary caregiver for much of Philomel\u2019s childhood. Seeing such a person openly hostile made her uncomfortable. Wherever she goes, does her presence only cause trouble?When Philomel\u2019s mood subsided, suddenly the nanny\u2019s body tilted over. Where did she go? She looked like someone had pushed her.\u201cOops!\u201dThe nanny, sprawled on her floor, screamed and struggled.\u201cYou pushed me! Oh, it\u2019s my waist! It catches people!\u201d\u201c\u2026What are you doing?\u201dEveryone around her, including Philomel, looked away from the nanny.\u201cYou pushed me!\u201d\u201cWho? Me?\u201dWhen the nanny pointed her finger at Philomel, she asked in bewilderment.\u201cDon\u2019t fall for yourself and catch a live person! We\u2019ve seen it all.\u201dWhen Countess Delles came forward to speak for Philomel, the others nodded her head. Anyone could see that the nanny collapsed by herself. Except for Ellensia, no one touched her body.\u201cIt can\u2019t be! Someone pushed me\u2026 did the princess see it?\u201dThe nanny asked with her hopes, but Ellensia also shook her head.\u201cRather than that, get up sooner. Embarrassingly, what kind of insolence is this?\u201dEllencia, with her cold expression, grabbed the nanny\u2019s arm and tried to raise her up. The nanny muttered about the unfair day, but when Ellensia did not take her side, she was helpless.\u201cI can\u2019t. I can\u2019t get up because I sprained my back.\u201dThe nanny, who had been groaning for a while, muttered helplessly. Her back pain was her chronic disease. In the end, four attendants grabbed the nanny by the limbs and carried her like a piece of luggage. Even if someone tried to carry her, the nanny was too heavy, and if she tried to touch her waist even a little, she would complain that she would get sick, so she had no choice but to do so.\u201cOh, it hurts! It hurts! Move it gently!\u201dEven so, screams resonated intermittently in the corridors of the imperial palace.\u201cAww.\u201dA cry was heard from behind. She turned around and she looked out of her silver-furred cat that was stretching contentedly.Philomel looked at the cat for a moment in the strange mood, then turned away.\u201cPrincess Ellencia.\u201dShe summoned Ellencia, who was about to follow in the nanny\u2019s footsteps. She had something to tell Ellencia.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know how that sounds, but I hope you stay away from the nanny. She\u2019s the one I\u2019ve been with when I was a kid\u2026\u201d\u201cPhilomel.\u201dElencia spoke in a rather low voice.\u201cDon\u2019t speak too badly of the nanny. I\u2019ll apologize for today. I think there was a misunderstanding. But she\u2019s a good nanny.\u201d\u201cNo. She\u2019s not a nice nanny.\u201d\u201cStop. She doesn\u2019t want to say bad things in a place where there are no parties. That\u2019s not right.\u201dShe was speechless. She was only trying to give advice, but hearing Elencia\u2019s words made her feel like a gossip.\u201cPrincess, the nanny\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll just go. I guess I too have to comfort the nanny after her accident.\u201d\u201cOh,\u201d Elencia stopped talking.\u201cBy the way, how did you decide to talk about your registration? Did you accept it?\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t been able to give an answer to His Majesty the Emperor yet.\u201d\u201cWhat do you think, Philomel?\u201d\u201cThanks for the offer, but I think it\u2019s too much for me.\u201dEllencia smiled gently.\u201cConsider it positively. It would be great if we became sisters. If we stay here, the day will come when Philomel and Nanny will clear up their misunderstandings about each other.\u201dSaying that, Ellencia quietly left.\u2018Misunderstanding?\u2019It wasn\u2019t funny, so she laughed instead. At least she knew what a nanny was like, a hundred times better than Ellencia herself. However, Ellencia seemed to have a great deal of trust in her nanny, whom she had only met for a few days.\u2018Has she been baked and boiled by the nanny already?\u2019\u201cMiss Philomel!\u201dAt that time, Count Pollan, who had heard of the situation from the attendants, hurriedly ran.\u201cWhat the hell is this\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat did the Count think by bringing such a woman into the palace again? She shouldn\u2019t do that considering what she did!\u201dWhen Countess Delles strongly argued, Pollan was perplexed and asked what was going on. After a while, Pollan, who heard the details, bowed his head deeply to Philomel and the Countess.\u201cI\u2019m so sorry! I thought I\u2019d been scolded and reflected on myself a little bit\u2026 It\u2019s all my responsibility for making the wrong decision.\u201d\u201cAre you going to chase after them?\u201d\u201cOf course. I\u2019m going to inform you now.\u201dPhilomel sent Countess Deles back to her room and she accompanied Pollan to the abode of Ellencia. The Countess Deles was reluctant to go see Philomel, but she did not object.The nanny was never one to step down. Especially if Ellencia wrapped and spined herself. She didn\u2019t mean that Philomel was going to be spiky, but she was better off sitting still and sucking her finger. When she reached Ellencia\u2019s residence, her maids informed her that her nanny was being nursed in her princess\u2019 room.The nanny was lying on the luxurious bed used by the princess, and Ellensia was sitting on her chair next to her. It was kind hearted to be kind to one of her subordinates, even to her own bed. Philomel watched one step behind her, and the Count stepped in front of them to announce the dismissal and expulsion of the nanny.\u201cIt\u2019s too much! Where are you going to go when you see this weak old woman? It\u2019s no different than telling me to get out and die!\u201d\u201cYou should have come to your senses when I gave you another chance. If you tell His Majesty the emperor about the indecent behavior you committed today, you will end up noticing it.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty could not believe that I was the empress\u2019 nanny\u2026\u201d\u201cShall we check now? We can go and report right away.\u201dWhen Count Pollan stubbornly went out, the nanny, at a loss for words, only mumbled at her.\u201cDon\u2019t forget to apologize to Miss Philomel.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cUh huh.\u201d whispered the nanny into her face.\u201c\u2026 sorry. I was wrong.\u201dThe situation seemed to end like that, but an ambush appeared.\u201cI feel so sorry for the nanny.\u201dElencia was weeping as she brushed the nanny\u2019s wrinkled hands.\u201cThe nanny hurt her back and she can\u2019t move at all. How can she get out of the palace?\u201d\u201cHa, but just by not asking for any other crimes\u2026\u201d\u201cDoes the Count have no mercy? Let her stay here at least until the nanny\u2019s back heals.\u201d\u201cPrincess, that\u2019s all for me\u2026 How can you live in a rough world when you\u2019re so kind.\u201dThe nanny sniffed and held Ellencia\u2019s hand tightly with both hands.Seeing Ellencia like that, her maids were also thrilled. With the exception of Philomel and Count Pollan, a wave of emotion flowed through the room.\u201cPhilomel.\u201dEllencia stood up from her chair and faced Philomel.\u201cIf you\u2019re worried that Daddy will be angry, I\u2019ll be sure to tell him. So can you forgive her nanny? The nanny is also reflecting on herself like this.\u201dBy naming Philomel, not Count Pollan, the subject of her nanny\u2019s departure was changed to Philomel.In place of Philomel, Count Pollan stepped in.\u201cNo matter how bad the circumstances are, it\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d\u201cBut the person who was harmed by the nanny is Philomel, so back off, Count.\u201dSuddenly, Ellencia\u2019s tone changed to a command tone. And then she turned to Mel.\u2018If I refuse here, am I the only one who is struggling to chase down the homeless old woman?\u2019It\u2019s a place to leave soon anyway. Her own reputation was good, but giving up her reputation did not seem to achieve her desired goal. If Ellencia takes this to Eustis anyway, he will most likely side with his biological daughter. Only Philomel becomes a bad person, and the nanny remains intact in the imperial palace.Philomel, lost in thought for a moment, opened her mouth.\u201cOkay. Do as the princess said.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cIf the nanny promises that once her back get better, she will leave immediately. I won\u2019t object.\u201d Philomel raised her index finger. \u201cNanny, when I was about eight years old, I fell down her steps and broke my leg, right?\u201d\u201cYes? Oh, that happened.\u201dAt the sudden change of topic, the nanny put on a blurry expression as if searching for her memories.\u201cDo you remember when you looked after me for twenty-four hours while I was handicapped?\u201d\u201cOf course! At that time, I also scooped and fed the princess and carried her with me when we moved.\u201dThe nanny\u2019s eyes were filled with ecstasy as she recalled her memories. For her nanny, it must have been the golden age of her life as she wielded her power as her own as her princess\u2019s guardian.\u201cIt was so nice to have a nanny by her side to support her when she was sick.\u201dOf course, it was a blatant lie. It was a hellish time for Philomel, as she was constantly exposed to her nanny\u2019s nagging and ramblings.\u2018But\u2026\u2019Philomel smiled broadly and added.\u201cSo, why don\u2019t we help the princess in the same way?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Princess Elencia?\u201d\u201cThis time, the sick person is the nanny. The nanny can lie in bed, but she can do a lot. She doesn\u2019t need to use herself as long as she\u2019s just teaching with words.\u201dThen the nanny nodded her head in her confidence.\u201cThat\u2019s right. The princess\u2019s mother, Isabella, also grew up receiving my teachings. I didn\u2019t know that Miss Philomel would understand my hard work so well and escape.\u201d\u201cJust in case, I\u2019ll make the bed every day. How about staying in this room and taking good care of the princess like you did when I slept next to you?\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Translator Note:How to say this? Ellencia is\u2026 I won\u2019t say stupid but girl! at least listen to what a person that know the nanny has to say about her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 37": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/There Is No Place For FakesCH 37Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe nanny\u2019s eyes lit up.\u201cOh, that makes a lot of sense.\u201d\u201cWait a minute. That\u2019s a bit\u2026 Wouldn\u2019t it be hard on the nanny? I think she\u2019ll get her back going faster if she rests comfortably in a quiet place.\u201dEllencia hurriedly intervened, but the nanny insisted on expressing her loyalty.\u201cI\u2019m fine! It\u2019s okay if my back gets better slowly, so I want to help the princess by her side.\u201dShe had to leave the palace as soon as her back got better. If so, the nanny\u2019s power would come to an end on that day. So she would want to somehow stick to Ellencia and take root in her palace. Even if she stayed in her closet for the treatment, she would never have a chance to exert her influence over the princess.Philomel stood by the nanny.\u201cPrincess, please allow the nanny to stay that way.\u201d\u201cThat is\u2026\u201dThen, Ellencia hesitated and glanced sideways at Count Pollan.\u201cMiss Philomel, wouldn\u2019t you really mind doing that?\u201dCount Pollan seemed to believe that Philomel was too kind to her to play the part to her detriment.\u201cOf course. The nanny is just lying here, so what\u2019s the point of her bumping into me? It would be easier for the princess to adapt to life in the imperial palace if she stayed with the nanny.\u201d\u201c\u2026 In that case, I will follow your command. However, as long as the nanny\u2019s stay is prolonged, I will have no choice but to inform His Majesty the Emperor.\u201d, said Count Pollan sternly, looking down at the nanny.\u201cThanks Miss Philomel and serve Her Highness the Princess with all your heart and sincerity.\u201d\u201cYes, how can I not?\u201dCount Pollan asked for consent from Elencia this time.\u201cIs Her Highness okay too?\u201d\u201c\u2026that is.\u201dWhen Elencia didn\u2019t immediately answer, the nanny sniffed out loud. She also added that he would sit on the street when she went out and that she had no family to take care of her.\u201c\u2026Yes, please do so.\u201dThe kind Ellencia eventually accepted Philomel\u2019s proposal.\u201cLady Ellencia, don\u2019t worry. I will be by your side and give you clear guidance so that the princess can acquire the dignity she deserves. Even if she grew up among lowly things, her noble lineage doesn\u2019t go anywhere. I\u2019ll drain all the water from lowly things. \u201cThe nanny who had achieved her wish smirked. She wasn\u2019t talking about Philomel, but when she imagined her nanny\u2019s \u2018sure guidance\u2019, she got goosebumps.After the nanny gave Ellencia her long speech about her princess\u2019s manners, Philomel left with her countess.\u2018Ellensia, since you haven\u2019t experienced the nanny care yet, she hasn\u2019t betrayed your naive faith in people.\u2019Philomel knew the nanny well. She may have been a good nanny when she was young, but she wasn\u2019t now. Even if she was an angel who had come down to earth, she assured her that if she stayed with the nanny for a few days, she would get rid of her crane.She thought, \u2018It\u2019s a bit unfortunate that Ellencia is going to be harassed by the nanny, but it can\u2019t be helped.\u2019This was all for Elencia\u2019s own sake.Count Pollan walked beside her and started talking.\u201cI was once again impressed by the merciful kindness of the princess Philomel.\u201d\u201cI am no longer a princess.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dShe just pointed out the obvious, but he was startled.She said, \u201cThe real princess, the real daughter of His Majesty the Emperor, has returned, so I am no longer the princess.\u201d\u201cYeah, but if you\u2019re registered with the imperial family, you\u2019ll\u2026 Haven\u2019t you heard from His Majesty yet about the enlistment?\u201d\u201cI heard about it, but I declined.\u201d\u201cWhy? Why did you do that!\u201dPollan\u2019s mouth dropped open, as if he was more surprised than before. Philomel was even more surprised by his reaction.\u2018Is it really surprising that I refused to register?\u2019But she was soon convinced. She promised to reap the cuckoo chick that has rolled into someone else\u2019s nest after she had taken the place of their own child. She was so gracious that even a saint would cry. She grabs a passer-by there and asks. If she were asked to choose whether to live as a sinner\u2019s daughter or a princess, how many would choose the former? Not just from Count Pollan\u2019s point of view, but from a general point of view, Philomel\u2019s choice would have blown away her good luck.But she had no intention of telling him why she didn\u2019t want to be registered. Philomel decided to make the count understand in a different direction.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to be registered. Have there been any cases like mine in the history of the Belerov Empire?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201dPollan shut his mouth. As Philomel had said, it was an unprecedented case in the long history of the Empire.It was his job to bring someone who didn\u2019t have a drop of blood into the Emperor\u2019s hands. Enrollment of the imperial family was usually done for a thoroughly political purpose rather than the will of the person concerned. First, when the emperor had no children worthy of inheriting the throne. There were several cases in which a collateral lineage not far from the direct line was registered to inherit the throne. Second, if they needed to enter into a marriage alliance with a foreign country, but they did not have a suitable child to marry. At that time, the children of the imperial family or high-ranking nobles were formally registered and then married. But no one of those cases was Philomel\u2019s.In fact, for the same reasons as those two, even if she needed to be registered, Philomel, who was not a member of the imperial family or a noble, could not set foot in the imperial family. Even if Philomel accepted the offer, it was obvious that the nobles would strongly oppose it. She wondered if Eustis, who possessed the mighty imperial authority, pushed ahead with the determination to carry out a large-scale purge.\u2018Of course there\u2019s no way.\u2019Pollan opened his mouth without giving up persuasion.\u201cStill, it\u2019s not like there aren\u2019t any similar precedents. It is said that the 7th Emperor registered the daughter of a vassal who died while defending him and took it as his daughter. Even though that vassal was a commoner\u2026\u201d\u2018When was that story, about 800 years ago?\u2019Wrinkles formed between Philomel\u2019s eyebrows over the years. At that point, it was the realm of legend, not history. As she rummaged through what she had learned in her history class, something bothered her.\u201cWait. Isn\u2019t Eustis the 7th emperor?\u201d\u201cYes, it is.\u201dAdjudication. The royal family, who were not originally emperors, were promoted to emperors by their descendants after death. Usually, when a non-child of an emperor became emperor, the title of emperor was bestowed upon his deceased parents. Although it was nominal, it was to make up for the lack of legitimacy by becoming the son of the emperor.\u201cSince he wasn\u2019t the emperor during all his lifetime, of course there wouldn\u2019t be much opposition if he took a commoner as his daughter.\u201dIt was a matter of a completely different level from the case of an emperor living and reigning and registering a commoner.\u201cWell. It\u2019s not that there\u2019s no precedent at all, it\u2019s that good\u2026\u201d\u201cThe evidence seems insufficient.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe it\u2026 I\u2019ve spent three days and nights trying to find it\u2026\u201dCount Pollan rubbed his bright eyes and cried.\u2018You did a good job of excavating an anecdote from the days when there was not much material left.\u2019It was easy to draw Count Pollan, who must have struggled with the old records in the archives of the Imperial Palace Library.\u201cWhy did you go so far?\u201d, asked Philomel, who felt a little sorry for him.\u201cI posted that it was unprecedented, and His Majesty told me to bring it by any means. I searched all night and couldn\u2019t find it. I couldn\u2019t go back home, so it\u2019s been over five days since I saw my daughter\u2019s face.\u201dPhilomel expressed hers silent condolences to the father of a three-year-old. But it was something Count Pollan fell for the emperor\u2019s recklessness.\u2018I have to do something.\u2019It seemed that she would have to meet the emperor in person and negotiate. Before the poor Count Pollan made history that really didn\u2019t exist. But she had work to do first.\u201cCount Pollan. No, Count.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201dAlthough Philomel had given up her late title, Count Pollan had not yet given up hope of her being registered and treated her as his princess.\u2018For now, let\u2019s just let him do what he wants.\u2019Instead, Philomel spoke out what she wanted.\u201cI want to meet my real mother. Please take me to the prison where she is kept.\u201dThere was someone she had to meet before leaving that place. That was Philomel\u2019s biological mother, Catherine Hounds.Catherine\u2019s story came this morning from Countess Deles. They eat and chat together, when she brings up her words about a recent sighting on her side.\u201cWell, I happened to pass by and saw a woman being dragged out of His Majesty\u2019s office. It was so terrifying to see the blood dripping from her hands.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Do you remember what the woman looked like?\u201d\u201cWell, she kept her head down, so I didn\u2019t see anything except that her hair was brown. The maids there said the emperor was very angry. What crime did she commit? I\u2019m afraid.\u201dA woman with brown hair.During that time, she was a person who committed a crime worthy of being directly brought before the emperor.It was the nanny who appeared shortly thereafter that embodied on her side what had been nothing more than a dim light.\u201cOh, that should look like the controller in prison\u2026\u201dThe nanny, who couldn\u2019t get up because of her back sprained, said so. It was a grumble that bordered on talking to oneself, but Philomel heard it clearly. Catherine, the woman who gave birth to Philomel was in the palace.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Translator Note:Am I the only one that thought, for a moment at least, that Philomel wanted the nanny to stay in the palace to take revenge? I must be a really bad person.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 38": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/There Is No Place For FakesCH 38Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cOriginally, it\u2019s a really bad thing, but please keep it a secret if you are found.\u201dCount Pollan repeatedly asked.\u201cSure.\u201dPhilomel nodded her head as she followed Count Pollan to the Imperial Palace Prison. Still, he let out a big sigh, feeling uneasy. She was about to take the lead after coaxing Count Pollan, who jumped up and down, saying that Catherine was a high treason and cannot let her meet without the emperor\u2019s burial.\u2018In the process, after meeting my birth mother and clearing my mind, I told a white lie that I would positively consider enlisting, but\u2026\u2019\u201cIt\u2019s okay. As long as the Count makes it clear that everyone else is going to be caught.\u201dThere was only one question in Philomap\u2019s mind as she responded rather insincerely to the Count.\u2018How come Catherine is still alive?\u2019Even if Catherine escaped, the prediction that she would eventually be caught was correct. Even Philomel, who had the ring of prominence and prepared to escape in advance, was caught like that. As such, the pursuit of the empire was difficult to avoid. Even so, she told her to run away as her last consideration for her mother, who had brought herself into the world.There was a glimmer of hope that, by chance, Catherine would be lucky enough to succeed in her run, but such a future was completely unexpected even to Philomel.She thought, \u2018She was captured but is still alive.\u2019Even in the book, Catherine was captured, but she was not spared from execution.\u2018Did Ellencia\u2019s plea move the Emperor\u2019s heart because something changed?\u2019Maybe that variable was created because Philomel\u2019s actions brought everything forward by a year. Then Count Pollan pointed forward and said.\u201cThat\u2019s the imperial prison.\u201dUnlike other buildings in the imperial palace, a rough-looking stone building appeared in front of her eyes. Even the spring sunlight in sunny weather was not enough to erase the gloomy energy flowing from the building. The gatekeeper standing in front of the building recognized them and bowed.\u201cCount Pollan and the princess.\u201dPhilomap was no longer the princess, but the people of the place hesitated and treated her the same as before.\u2018Why are you so awkward?\u2019Philomel stood behind Count Pollan with a puzzled look on her face.\u201cShe came to see \u2018the woman\u2019.\u201dCount Pollan opened his mouth in a low voice.\u201cYou can go in. The prison guard will guide you.\u201dThe gatekeeper opened the door without question. The emperor\u2019s secretary and daughter passed the strict surveillance without incident. Count Pollan decided to accompany her only to the entrance and face Catherine alone with Philomel. It was because she couldn\u2019t keep him busy all the time, and Philomel had asked him to do so.Before Count Pollan left, she thanked him.\u201cIt must have been difficult, but thank you for listening to my request.\u201d\u201c\u2026my.\u201dCount Pollan stared at Philobel with serious eyes.\u201cNo matter what anyone says, the princess might be Her Majesty\u2019s.\u201dWith a shy smile, the count left the imperial prison.\u201c\u2026no, Count. I am not that man\u2019s daughter.\u201dPhilodel heard a belated reply.\u201cI just wanted to tell you this.\u201d* * *\u201cHere it is. Princess.\u201dA prison guard guided her to the prison where Catherine was. Philomel winked, and he hurried back the way he had come. This allowed him to briefly talk to Catherine.\u201cEllen? Are you Ellen?\u201dAt her pretending to be alive, the woman in the prison barred her face close to her bars. A crackling sound echoed through the prison.\u201cSorry. It\u2019s not the daughter you expected.\u201dPhilomel took a step closer to Catherine and answered quietly.\u201cPhilomel\u2026!\u201dRecognizing Philomel\u2019s face, the woman\u2019s face was stained with astonishment, just like the first time she saw her. Philomel sneered coldly.\u2018I am not your daughter until the end.\u2019Then, after a moment of hesitation, Catherine reached out her hand over her bars. Her fingertips trembled slightly.\u201cHave you been caught too? Are you all right? I\u2019m glad. I\u2019m so glad. Come and show me your face\u2026\u201dMatch!Philomel removed her hand.\u201cNow don\u2019t pretend to worry.\u201dWas it because of her own actions when she found Elencia? Catherine exclaimed in an urgent voice.\u201cNo, don\u2019t get me wrong! I didn\u2019t know you\u2019d be here. I didn\u2019t think anyone but Ellen was worth coming to see me\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, is that so? Then I\u2019ll say yes.\u201dPhilomel sneered, holding her breath. Uncharacteristically, she reacted too emotionally. Didn\u2019t she know well that Catherine was such a person anyway? She didn\u2019t see her as her daughter, and the very drawn-out woman couldn\u2019t look straight at Philomel, she only looked at the floor.She said, \u201cI fell nothing but sorry for you. I know it\u2019s a sin that can\u2019t be washed away even if I pray for the rest of my life\u2026\u201dCatherine muttered in a small voice that she could only hear if she were very attentive. Philomel looked at her silently. She had a hand wrapped in a bandage, probably injured and shackles on the ankles, but she didn\u2019t feel sympathy for her.Kidnapping the princess was a sin worthy of death. Ellensia\u2019s request might have saved her life for now, but she would soon be executed according to the book. So there was no need for Philomel to pour out her feelings.\u201cI\u2019m glad I bought the last hour of my life, even for a short while. Your daughter gave it to me, so make the most of it.\u201d\u201cPhilomel\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m leaving this place. I\u2019m going to go somewhere I don\u2019t know and live quietly.\u201dShe didn\u2019t know if there was such a place in the yard where her face was unknown all over the continent.\u201cSo goodbye. Please rest in peace until the last moment.\u201dPhilomel calmly continued. She was what she feels now. She somehow wanted her to feel at ease until her brutal death. And she was sincere in that. After all she was the one who gave birth to her but never became her mother.\u2018Hi and goodbye forever.\u2019Her pleading made Catherine\u2019s eyes wet.\u201cWait a minute! Can\u2019t you just stay here a little longer? Huh? I\u2019m begging you. Please, please\u2026\u201dDid the last goodbye at least get emotional? Philomel suddenly felt unbearably loathsome for Catherine, who stretched out her hand affectionately toward her.\u201cWhy? Ah, should I tell you about Ellencia, which you are so curious about?\u201dA black flame blazed in Philomel\u2019s chest.\u201cElencia is doing well. She plays backgammon with her real father, and her real mother\u2019s nanny takes good care of her. She lives well enjoying the things she should normally enjoy in a large and splendid room that is incomparably larger than that shabby house.\u201dAs she poured out her words as she thought, a question came to her mind. Why hadn\u2019t Ellencia visited that place yet? Wasn\u2019t she worried about her mother?She thought, \u2018Is it simply because Eustis wouldn\u2019t let her?\u2019Catherine replied weakly.\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m curious about Ellen.\u201d\u201cThen what is it?\u201d\u201c\u2026Is Ellen the same as usual?\u201dPhilomel snorted. At the end everything was to talk about Ellencia.\u201cHow do I know what he was like?\u201d\u201cThen is Ellen normal?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201dIt was a strange question. Is she \u2018normal\u2019?At that time, an alien light hovered in Catherine\u2019s eyes. There was a dark tinge of disbelief and anxiety.\u201c\u2026Ellen has changed.\u201dShe bit her lips and groaned like a scream.\u201cShe got weird a few months ago. She\u2019s not the Ellen I knew.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s weird about her?\u201dIt didn\u2019t sound like a lie to get out of the situation. Philomel frowned and asked.\u201cAll.\u201d\u201cHow specifically?\u201dCatherine pondered.\u201cHmm. Her way of speaking has changed, her gait has changed, and her appetite was like a different person\u2019s\u2026\u201dThen, as if she was surprised by what she said, she suddenly waved her hand.\u201cNo! I made a mistake. I said that Ellen had become a different person but\u2026 What must have happened to her because she\u2019s been in a place like this all along.\u201dCatherine pulled the corners of her mouth, but in Philomel\u2019s eyes she looked like she was afraid of something.\u201c\u2026\u201dAnd for a while, neither of them said anything. The woman who rubbed her hands left her last words.\u201cGo out now. If you get caught here for no reason, you might be misunderstood that you are conspiring with me. And thank you for visiting me one last time.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 39": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/There Is No Place For FakesCH 39Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayPhilomel finished the visit and walked the opposite way.\u2018Can I trust Catherine\u2019s words?\u2019Even though she was her biological mother, she did not fully trust her. After all, she\u2019s the villain who stole her friend\u2019s child.\u2018If it\u2019s a trick to alleviate even a little bit of sin\u2026?\u2019But she didn\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything to be gained by telling lies like that. In the book, Catherine calmly accepts her death as Ellencia returns to her original place. There was also a description that Catherine\u2019s nature was not evil, although she was mad with jealousy. Perhaps Philomel\u2019s move, which was different from the original, has brought about some change.\u2018Otherwise, there is no valid basis for Catherine\u2019s words\u2026\u2019Philomel soon found herself wanting to trust Catherine and collapsed.\u2018What is the strength of blood relationship?\u2019Philomel lightly patted her cheek with both hands.\u201cWake. Don\u2019t dig too deep, swayed by trivial words.\u201dPutting aside the contents of the book and looking at the situation objectively, the conclusion was obvious. Catherine, who kidnapped her friend\u2019s daughter the moment she died, and Ellencia, a kind woman who grew up being mistreated by her kidnapper. In this situation, it didn\u2019t make sense for her to trust Catherine.She didn\u2019t have to feel pity for nothing. Although she was her biological mother, it was not long before she met Catherine, and the two were close to each other. On the other hand, everyone knows that Ellencia was kind\u2026\u2018Yes?\u2019Suddenly, a strong sense of discomfort came over her.\u201c\u2026Why do you think Ellencia is kind?\u201dIf Catherine was a stranger to Philomel, then Ellencia was also a stranger. The time they had known each other was not long, and the number of times they had had conversations could be counted on one hand. But why did she believe Ellencia was good?The answer was simple. Because it says so in the book.It\u2019s because it\u2019s in <Princess Ellencia>, which has been a guideline and milestone in Philomel\u2019s life since she was nine! By that point, Philo Mel had come to her fundamental question. Could she completely trust <Princess Elencia>?It was a question that she consciously or unconsciously did not want to ask. In fact, there was not one or two things she had been suspicious about. Unlike the books known as prophetic books, it took the form of a novel. For example, the fact that it was away from the garden as if anyone was showing it.When she just picked up the book, she didn\u2019t have time to ponder deeply because she was overwhelmed by the contents, but as she grew older, her doubts about Philomel\u2019s book grew. At the time, these were questions that could not be resolved, so she just buried them.Wasn\u2019t it an existence that didn\u2019t burn even if she tried to burn it with fire in the first place? Suspiciously, there was nothing like that book.Her breath was choked. It felt as if the bottom of her feet were sinking. Philomel quickly returned to her place, as if being chased by something.\u201cAww.\u201dCountess Delles and her maids did not appear to be away, only the cat greeted Philomel. She wanted to read the book again to check it, but she had left the book at the dorm when she left Angelium.Thanks to reading it countless times, she understood everything about it, but the overwhelming anxiety did not disappear. What if there was an inadvertently overlooked hint? Were there any gaps she hadn\u2019t figured out yet? With that book telling her the future, she was able to put her mind at ease, albeit a little, even in her life where she had no corner to rely on. But since she had no books, she felt as if she had been thrown into the stormy sea with a lumbering sailboat. It was a symptom of her anxiety about trusting the books and leaving her house.Philomel chewed on her lips in her nervousness.\u201cI have to go get the book too!\u201dAs soon as she made up her mind, she headed for the door. Since she had only left the inn two days ago, there was a high probability that she had not yet disposed of the items the guest had left behind. She intended to ask Eustis to send itr to her.\u2018I will be monitored, but I will be let go if I agree to stay here for three months.\u2019For her, the most important thing was whether or not what she had firmly believed in as the truth for half her life was the truth. And if\u2026 If <Princess Ellencia> was not a prophetic book\u2026\u2018What am I\u2026?\u2019Her weak vertigo staggered her feet as she stood up. She wanted to fall forward.\u201cOops. Are you okay?\u201dSomeone\u2019s arm grabbed Philomel by the waist and supported her so she wouldn\u2019t fall. At the same time, an oddly bright golden light entered her eyes. Philomel called out to his and she pronounced the man\u2019s name.\u201c\u2026Le Guin?\u201dThe other party answered without hesitation.\u201cYes. My name is Le Guin.\u201d\u201cUh, why are you here?\u201dPhilomel freaked out and pulled Le Guin\u2019s arm away and quickly stepped back from him.\u201cObviously, movement magic is not possible in the imperial palace\u2026\u201dDue to the barrier to suppress magic, unauthorized persons could not use magic in the imperial palace. It was a semi-permanent power bestowed by the sun god for the first emperor, his beloved child. But how could Le Guin, who should be in the Mage Tower, was in there!\u201cWho do you think I am? There is no magic in this world that I cannot break.\u201dLe Guin replied with an arrogant smile.\u201cAnd we\u2019ve been together since last night.\u201dLe Guin pretended to be friendly and added those words.\u201cWhen are we? Don\u2019t get me wrong.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s too much. You told me to wait quietly before going out, so I stayed there even though I was bored.\u201dLe Guin pointed his finger at a purple cushion lying in one corner. Concerned that the bare floor might not be hard, it was the cushion she had given the cat this morning. The silver-haired cat occupied the cushion as if it understood Philomel\u2019s words.\u2018Wait, Silver?\u2019Coincidentally, the person in front of her also had silver hair. Come to think of it, the eyes are also the same gold as that sheep.\u201c\u2026Could you be that cat?\u201dPhilomel stuttered and asked.\u201cRight.\u201dLe Guin replied with a light nod of his head.\u201cLie!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not lying. Shall I show you how I transform?\u201dWhen Philomel disbelieved, Le Guin snorted at her, and soon after, with a pop, a familiar cat appeared.\u201cOhhhh.\u201dThe cat meowed proudly as if it were Le Guin.Just yesterday, Philomel\u2019s soul had been taken out of his cute appearance.Pop!The man reappeared.\u201cDid you see it? I tried to reveal myidentity when you were alone, but a woman like the Countess or something kept sticking around, so I got scolded for waiting.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m sleeping so hard to call you up. Ah, I\u2019ve been looking for an opportunity ever since you were in the center of the imperial palace, but I didn\u2019t want to approach you because you had so much divine power.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Go.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cGet out now!\u201dHe dodged the cushion thrown by Philomel with a flexible movement.Philomel trembled with rage. She was deceived.\u2018I even thought that if the original owner doesn\u2019t show up, I\u2019ll keep it!\u2019She even secretly thought about what to name him. After that, it took another thirty minutes for Philomel to calm her excitement.* * *After a while. Philomel admitted she needed to talk to her real father who came to visit her and she put off kicking him out.\u201cWhy are you sitting so far apart?\u201dBut what she decided and what her heart felt were different. Philomel calmly turned her head and answered Le Guin\u2019s question.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but please don\u2019t come near me.\u201d\u201c\u2026What did I do?\u201d\u201cIt just makes me feel a little bit like that.\u201dThe two of them were sitting at either end of a long, straight sofa and having a strange conversation.\u201cDon\u2019t you like cats? They are cute.\u201d\u201cI like cats. When it\u2019s a real cat.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t being cute a superficial attribute?According to Philomel\u2019s common sense, that standard was much more difficult. A grown man meowing like a cat and rubbing against her leg\u2026\u2018This is unscrupulous!\u2019She was not a saint, but was it okay to let the mage be? It was Philomel\u2019s theory that the leader of a large organization must have a heavy dignity. Sitting crookedly with his feet on the table, Le Guin squirmed.\u201cLexion guy, he said you\u2019d like cats\u2026 Let\u2019s see later.\u201dWhen she first saw him, she couldn\u2019t feel it because she was distracted, but no matter how she looked at it, he didn\u2019t seem like a very healthy person. At the same time, she also felt relieved. Wasn\u2019t she really lucky? She hadn\u2019t kissed the cat yet.\u2018Actually, I was going to do it after taking a bath.\u2019If it had been revealed a little too late, Philomel would have somewhat lost her will to live.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And even pretending to be a cat.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with coming to see my daughter?\u201dLe Guin crossed his arms and replied in a tone that said it was natural.\u201c\u2026Do you want to pick me up?\u201dPhilomel asked with a puzzled expression.\u201cLet\u2019s go back to the Magic Tower together.\u201dShe looked at Le Guin\u2019s outstretched hand for a moment, then jerked her head.\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re doing this now.\u201dHe acted as if he didn\u2019t need her and now he wanted to go to the Magic Tower together? His appearance was so sudden that she forgot about it for a while, but the first meeting with her real father didn\u2019t end well.\u201cI don\u2019t need it. Money or whatever you give me, I don\u2019t need it.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re just blood mixed, but we\u2019re no different.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t appear again, so live well.\u201dAfterwards, even though she learned the secret of her birth from Lexion, the disappointment she felt at that time did not change. It might be better in that he didn\u2019t mess with this or that woman, but it was still true that he arbitrarily gave birth to a child and did not properly take responsibility as his parent. Nurturing, affection, attention, things like that. Of course, he had to pay Catherine. But when it came to money, he gave the emperor too much to himself.\u2018Even though I held back to manage my reputation and didn\u2019t receive it well.\u2019If she had been extravagant like \u2018Philomel\u2019 in the book, wouldn\u2019t it have been enough to easily buy a few islands by now?\u201cI just felt like I had to see you again. I thought I\u2019d know why when I saw your face\u2026\u201d\u201cSo do you know it already?\u201dPhilomel and Le Guin looked at each other.\u201cI don\u2019t know yet.\u201dLe Guin was still expressionless, so she was unable to read his emotions.\u201cAre you sorry for me?\u201dPhilomel hesitated for a moment before asking. Then the man holding his chin furrowed his brow for a moment, then shook his head.\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never felt sorry for anyone.\u201d\u201cYou said you were sorry before.\u201d\u201cAh, sorry. Since you\u2019re my child, of course I thought you were a wizard.\u201d\u201cSorry. I\u2019m not sure.\u201dPhilomel spat out the words, recalling the conversation she had with him at the magic tower.\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 usually in situations like that, other people say they\u2019re sorry, so I just copied it.\u201dLe Guin answered lightly, as if he didn\u2019t care at all.\u2018I knew it\u2019Even then, he didn\u2019t look sorry at all.\u201cThen do you sympathize with me?\u201d\u201cHmm. I don\u2019t know that either. I\u2019ve never felt pity for another person.\u201d\u2018What the hell do you know?\u2019 the words went down her throat and then went back.Little by little, Lexion\u2019s words that Le Guin was an emotionless person reached her. She didn\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible for a creature to have no emotions at all, but at least he was in a different category than normal people.She could feel that an insurmountable river flowed between him and herself. If he had raised Philomel like other parents, he wouldn\u2019t have given her affection.\u2018I\u2019m coveting something that wasn\u2019t mine in the first place.\u2019Philomel folded her regrets and put them away. Le Guin applied for Philomel.\u201cSo you\u2019re not going to the Magic Tower?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I didn\u2019t say I wasn\u2019t going.\u201dTo be honest, she didn\u2019t really want to live in the Magic Tower. The reason why she dared to go to the Mage Tower in the first place was because it is a place where the influence of the empire did not reach. However, the emperor said yesterday that he had no intention of holding Philomel guilty. He even said he would send them wherever he wanted. If she believed those words right away, she didn\u2019t even know how to use magic, so she had no reason to go to the mage tower.\u2018To be honest, I want to go to a place where no one knows me and start a new life.\u2019She was sincere in prison about what she said to Catherine. Still, that was a good opportunity. If she stayed with him, she would be able to escape the palace even if she didn\u2019t accept the three-month residency condition.\u2018As a bonus, if you go to Angelium, the town next to the Magic Tower, you can also retrieve <Princess Elencia>.\u2019After that, she thought it would be better to think about it after leaving that place. It was a complete farewell to the imperial palace, where she had lived so far.\u201cThen it\u2019s simple. We\u2019re going to the Magic Tower.\u201dLe Guin held out her hand once more.\u201cBut.\u201dHowever, Philomel\u2019s hand, which was about to take hers, stopped in mid-air. What? For some reason, Philomel couldn\u2019t hold his hand readily. Several faces passed before her eyes.\u201cInstead, promise me one thing. You\u2019ll never leave without a word again. As for me\u2026let me know and go.\u201dFirst the Countess Deles.\u201cRegardless of Your Majesty\u2019s wishes, I also want to continue serving you.\u201dThen Count Pollan.\u201c\u2026 sorry.\u201dEustis\u2019s words of sorry sounded very awkward.\u201cIt got weird a few months ago. She\u2019s not the Ellen I knew.\u201d\u201cThank you for coming in one last time.\u201dAnd even what Catherine said.\u2018Why do these memories come to my mind at this moment?\u2019As if someone had applied glue, her lips did not come off. As Philomel hesitated, the smile on Le Guin\u2019s face slowly faded.\u2018No, I have to seize the opportunity before he changes his mind.\u2019Philomel opened her mouth hastily, noticing that he might take back the offer.\u201cThere\u2026!\u201dWhen she managed to open her heavy mouth.\u201cYes. Even just watching for a moment, I could see that you had lived a tight life.\u201dLe Guin muttered to himself and nodded.\u201cI think your life must have been very tiring. I can fully imagine how you feel right now.\u201dLe Guin continued, \u201cI know, I know\u201d and agreed to himself.\u2018You know my heart that I don\u2019t know? How can you be my father?\u2019He said with confidence.\u201cYou want to fuck the humans here?\u201d\u201c\u2026Not at all.\u201d\u201cI understand. I\u2019m the type of person who can\u2019t live without suffering. You resembles me in that way.\u201dIt didn\u2019t look like it at all. He seemed to have misunderstood Philomel\u2019s silence. She hoped he didn\u2019t create resemblances on his own. Before Philomel could say anything, the wizard laid down on the sofa and declared.\u201cThen I\u2019ll be here too.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201dWhat else are you talking about?\u201cI will stay here until you decide to go to the Magic Tower. I want to help you with your revenge.\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 What about the magic tower? Since it\u2019s the magic tower, there shouldn\u2019t be a mountain of tasks to handle.\u201dPhilomel answered with her mouth wide open. Then Le Guin grinned and gave a reason that was difficult to understand with Philomel\u2019s common sense.\u201cYou didn\u2019t know. I don\u2019t do much work.\u201d\u201cCan it be? Work rushes to the Mage Tower every day from all over the continent. Other than the Mage Tower Master who oversees the Mage Tower, who will take care of that?\u201d\u201cYou just have to let other guys do that. Phil, keep that in mind. Life is better when you work less and make more money.\u201dLe Guin said as if he was teaching a great life wisdom. From Philomel\u2019s mouth came a busy, \u2018huh\u2019.\u2018The Magic Tower, is it really okay as it is?\u2019Since it is the center of the magic world, the problem of the Magic Tower is not limited to the problem of the Magic Tower alone. Philomel swallowed the question, worrying about the future of the Belerov Empire and, by extension, the continent.Le Guin said \u201cOh.\u201d and clapped their hands.\u201cI forgot, but there was a reason why it was difficult for me to leave right now.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cBecause the roads can cross.\u201d\u201cWho have you been with?\u201dHe was on his way.\u201cSo that\u2019s\u2026\u201dEven if it was a promise, Le Guin opened his mouth and then closed it again with a sour expression.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you finish talking?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m too lazy to explain in detail. There\u2019s such a thing. You\u2019ll find out soon.\u201dEven though she didn\u2019t ask earlier, he was talking about this and that! Philomel felt like shouting, but she managed to hold back. Yet she had reasons not to listen to Le Guin\u2019s planting.Philomel asked in an impatient voice, recalling <Princess Elencia>.\u201cThen can you move me to Angelium? I left my luggage there. And earlier\u2026 I just said it, but the answer was not revenge or something like that. I don\u2019t want that.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s yours, I\u2019ve retrieved it, so don\u2019t worry. It\u2019ll be on its way here by now.\u201d\u201cIs my luggage on the way?\u201dDid he even have a foot on the load to go there? Philomel didn\u2019t understand, so she involuntarily tilted her head.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m back.\u201dPhilomel hurriedly turned her head towards Le Guin. Looking at Le Guin\u2019s outfit, it didn\u2019t look like the uniform of a court wizard. It was clear that everyone would be astonished to see a seemingly suspicious man break into the imperial palace, especially the inner palace where the imperial family resided.\u201cHide now! No. Go back to being a cat!\u201d\u201cOh, okay. Don\u2019t push me.\u201dLe Guin, who had been pushed towards the terrace by Philomel, snapped his fingers grunting. At the same time he turned into a cat, people opened the door and came in.\u201cOops. You\u2019re inside. I didn\u2019t hear an answer, so I thought you went out and didn\u2019t come back yet.\u201d\u201cHaha, I see. I guess I didn\u2019t hear it because I was thinking about something else for a while.\u201dShe could see one of the maids tilting her head as she looked at a cushion that had fallen in the wrong place.\u201cThen why did everyone go out at once?\u201dShe spoke her words hastily to divert their attention to Phil. However, the atmosphere suddenly subsided.\u201cThat\u2019s actually\u2026 Countess Deles is going to tell you.\u201d\u201cYour Highness! Please. Please save the other maids!\u201dHer maid, Nancy, jumped out and fell to her knees abruptly. She was crying, and looking closely, her eyes were red, as if she had cried once before.\u201cYou\u2026 Don\u2019t worry about it, Miss Philomel. And you, if you go this way, you might die.\u201dNancy had a flirtatious and dull side, but she was not a kid who said or did anything useless. Philomel had a hunch that they were hiding something from her.\u201cTell me what the hell is going on.\u201dPhilomel asked the Countess when she completely returned to the daytime of the princess.* * *\u201cSo, all of the servants who belonged to me were imprisoned except for the one here. That\u2019s what you mean.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. They say they are being interrogated, but the interrogation has already been over a week.\u201dAs Nancy sniffled, the other maids gave her a handkerchief to comfort her. But even they couldn\u2019t hide their worried faces. The situation was like that. It was said that right after Philomel disappeared, they were taken in for failing to properly assist the princess. However, Countess Deles was spared her guilt thanks to the fact she was the first to notice Philomel\u2019s absence.The three maids present there were not subject to punishment because they did not accompany the detached palace and guarded the palace. The purpose of their just going out together was to find out what the punishment would be for those who were imprisoned.\u201cI never thought it would turn out like this\u2026\u201dPhilomel, whose maids were being punished because of her escape, felt her heart heavy. She thought that if Philomel was the real princess, then whether or not she voluntarily disappeared, the attendants would be punished for her. It was her fault for not properly serving the one and only princess. However, she herself disappeared with the appearance of Ellensia, and it was obvious that she was a fake. She expected the courtiers to get into trouble, but she thought it would be over after just a few investigations\u2026\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me earlier?\u201dPhilomel asked with a small sigh. Countess Deles replied with an embarrassing face.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. You came so late yesterday that I was going to tell you today, but something unexpected happened\u2026\u201dSomething unexpected? Come to think of it, she remembered the incident in which the nanny started a riot in the morning. Right after that, Philomel stopped by Elencia\u2019s residence, and then immediately went to see Catherine. There was no time for Countess Deles to tell her anything.Philomel reassured them.\u201cIt happened because of me, so I\u2019ll solve it. Everyone, don\u2019t worry too much.\u201d\u201cYour Highness, thank you!\u201dThe maids thanked her in unison. It was fortunate that she had just rejected Le Guin\u2019s hand and not left. She almost didn\u2019t know for the rest of her life that if she did, things would become this crazy because of herself.Nancy, who had been laughing in relief, checked her watch and she said, \u201cWow!\u201d she screamed.\u201cIt\u2019s already time! Sorry! I\u2019ll bring you lunch soon!\u201dAfter a while, the maids served lunch.As in the morning, Philomel thought of how to rescue the trapped people while holding up the fork filled with healthy food.She thought, \u2018Shall I ask Le Guin to break out as a magician?\u2019No. He couldn\u2019t make everyone escape. And after that, if the Empire pursued it, it was obvious that it would be more difficult to rectify. The best thing would be for the Emperor to forgive them their sins. That was probably possible if she accepted the 3-month condition suggested by Eustis.\u2018Anyway, three months is too long. Can\u2019t it be reduced to three weeks?\u2019After all Philomel didn\u2019t say a word and the year transformed in three months.\u2018If I bargained well, wouldn\u2019t it have been 3 weeks, no 3 days\u2026?\u2019Just as she thought, what Nancy was saying to her reached her ears.\u201cHey, meow. You have to eat too. You haven\u2019t eaten breakfast, so don\u2019t skip lunch!\u201dNancy bruised as she set her bowl down in front of the cat. There was fresh raw fish in the bowl, but Le Guin didn\u2019t even pay attention.\u201cWhy is he like this? He looks so pretty, he has a very picky appetite.\u201dNancy muttered angrily as she stroked the cat\u2019s scruff.\u2018Ah, there was Le Guin.\u2019Philomel let out a small sigh and called out to Nancy.\u201cNancy.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019d rather not touch that cat from now on. Can you do that?\u201d\u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry! It\u2019s so cute that I didn\u2019t even realize it\u2026 I dared to touch and speak rudely to Her Highness\u2019s favorite cat. I will never do that again!\u201dNancy, her face white, apologized repeatedly and left her room.\u201cHuh? Ah, no, that\u2019s not necessary\u2026\u201dPhilomel looked at Nancy\u2019s back, who quickly disappeared, and muttered her words that she hadn\u2019t handed over to her. She heard that among nobles who keep pets, there were those who want their employers to treat animals with the same respect as they did to them. And they got jealous when someone touched their pet.Apparently, Nancy thought Philomel was of that sort.She felt a bit embarrassed. She only prevented Nancy from unknowingly groping the body of a suspicious man.\u201cAww.\u201dAt that time, the cat that came to her feet cried happily. She hated that taeyeonja\u2019s weak appearance, but she couldn\u2019t keep starving him. Looking at it now, it seemed that just because his body changed into a cat, his appetite did not change.In the morning she had a cat that wouldn\u2019t even bite a fish and she was worried, but he was a human. Rommel, who came out for his own meal, put a sandwich on a new plate and set it down on the floor.\u2018It\u2019s said that you shouldn\u2019t give human food to a cat, but it\u2019s not a real cat, so it\u2019s okay.\u2019Le Guin smelled it and started eating the sandwich. As she watched it, she felt subtle.\u2018Even though he looks like that, he\u2019s a stern human on the inside, but doesn\u2019t he have any qualms about eating like an animal?\u2019And his words that her luggage was coming this way bothered her.\u2018It\u2019s fortunate that it was recovered so it wasn\u2019t thrown away.\u2019At that time, Countess Deles, who had risen from her meal first, returned to her room.She said, \u201cYour Highness, I\u2019m sorry, but we have a guest in the middle of our meal.\u201d\u201cA guest?\u201dPhilomel\u2019s return was still unknown outside of the palace, but who could it be? Her doubts were quickly dispelled by a figure appearing behind her Countess.\u201cYour Highness the Princess.\u201d\u201c\u2026oh.\u201dThe last time she saw him, Nassar Avrydon stood there just as she was.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After serving the tea, the maids moved away. She didn\u2019t know why, but a mischievous laugh could be heard.\u201c\u2026Please drink.\u201dPhilomel pointed to a steaming cup and offered tea.\u201cThank you.\u201dBut Nassar only talked and did not touch the cup. Instead he, who had been staring at Philomel\u2019s face for a while, opened his mouth.\u201cIt\u2019s really fortunate that you\u2019re all right. I know what Your Highness is really like\u2026\u201dA voice full of thirst. She felt a sense of emotion as if he had witnessed a family member who had died and returned to life.\u201c\u2026yes. Well, that\u2019s how it happened.\u201d\u2018Well, after all, I\u2019m going to die when I get back to the palace, so I was so mean.\u2019Remembering the conversation in the carriage, Philomel felt embarrassed. Had she known it would be like this, she would not have said that she would do anything.\u201cHow are you feeling? I was really surprised that you passed out suddenly.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. At that time, I was tired and I was in shock, but there is nothing wrong with my body.\u201d\u201cI see. I\u2019m glad.\u201dBut his watchful gaze of her Philomel from her toes to the ends of her head did not fall.Burdened, Philomel changed the topic.\u201cCome to think of it, Nassar, you came here very quickly from Shengzen. Did you use the movement magic?\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s right. After Her Highness disappeared, I headed for the Magic Tower thinking that I should come to the capital as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cThe magic tower? If it\u2019s the magic tower, won\u2019t it be open for a while?\u201dWhen she was about to be scammed in front of the magic tower, she remembered what the broker had told her.\u201cThat\u2019s why I wondered if I should enter with Avrydon\u2019s name too\u2026\u201dA great aristocratic family could be the exception everywhere.\u201cI happened to meet a group of wizards heading to the capital nearby. That\u2019s why I came too.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re lucky.\u201dWhen he had to go to the capital, he accidentally met a group of wizards with the same destination. And, coincidentally, those who were capable of traveling magic accompanied by others. Philomel widened her eyes and nodded.\u201cWhat was even more amazing was that they were also on their way to the imperial palace.\u201dNassar smiled lightly at Philomel and continued his words.\u201cYesterday morning, two of the wizards belonging to the imperial palace suddenly resigned, and they said they came to apply for the vacant position after being contacted.\u201d\u201cThere are two imperial palace wizards? That\u2019s a big deal. The conditions are good, so if possible, nobody wants to quit.\u201dActually, it was a good topic, but she had nothing else to say, so Philomel pretended to be interested.Nassar answered sincerely.\u201cI think so too. However, it\u2019s a pity that one of them can\u2019t work here because there are three of them.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re a competent person, there are many places other than the imperial palace that want to hire you, so it should be fine.\u201d\u201cMy family is always looking for talented wizards.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAnd there was the expected silence.\u2018It\u2019s ruined.\u2019Philomel clicked her tongue inside her, unable to find anything to say to her. In the past, even though it was a common socialite topic, they would give and take for a long time, but it was strange to talk about it now.\u2018Because I\u2019m no longer the princess, nor am I Nassar\u2019s fianc\u00e9e.\u2019Suddenly, she couldn\u2019t figure out what it was like to live as a \u2018Philomel\u2019 other than the princess. Her lifelong goal was to become an impeccable princess, and her life\u2019s purpose was to run away at the right time while hiding the weak and vulnerable true self deep inside. It was the mask that protected Philomel from the danger of her death.\u201cThen, now that the fear of dying is gone?\u201dNow that she had thrown off the mask, she couldn\u2019t remember what the face underneath was like. Even with Nassar, whom she had known for over ten years, she did not know what to talk about.\u201cWhat kind of person was I\u2026?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know you had a cat.\u201dAt Nassar\u2019s words, Philomel\u2019s mind, which had been floating in the air, returned.\u201cA cat?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that the pet Your Highness is looking after?\u201dShe didn\u2019t know when it came along, but a silver cat was perched on one side of the drawing room.\u201cGo away.\u201dPhilomel waved her hand, telling him to get away from her seat. Eavesdropping on human conversations was a clear invasion of privacy. She couldn\u2019t do anything about her conversation with the Countess and the maids in the bedroom, but she didn\u2019t intend to have him listening to this conversation.\u201cAww.\u201dThen the cat staggered and left the parlor. Maybe it\u2019s because of her mood, but for some reason, she felt like her eyes were broken.\u201cThe cat is listening. It\u2019s like a person.\u201d\u2018Because he is a person.\u2019Philomel swallowed her words and changed the subject of the conversation.\u201c\u2026Let\u2019s drink quickly before the tea cools down.\u201dFinally, he lowers his head slightly to grab the teacup.\u2018Uh?\u2019Something caught Philomel\u2019s eyes.\u201cNassar, stay still for a moment.\u201d\u201cYes? Uh, uh.\u201dNassar let out a dazed noise as Philomel got up and moved closer. Platinum hair tickled Philomel\u2019s finger. She could feel him catch his breath.\u201cStay still.\u201dPhilomel lightly grabbed the shoulder that was about to move and pressed it. For some it\u2019s only a few seconds, but for others it\u2019s an eternity.\u201cIt\u2019s done. It\u2019s stuck in your head.\u201dPhilomel laughed as she held the shredded leaves in her hands. Nassar, who was watching her blankly, groped the back of his head.\u201c\u2026I couldn\u2019t check my clothes because I was in a hurry. Sorry for showing you this.\u201dAs soon as Nassar arrived at the capital with his movement magic, he seemed to have come right away. If any of my family members or employees of Avrydon had seen the leaves, there was no way they wouldn\u2019t have told him.\u201cI thought the young Duke was always perfect, but he had a side like this.\u201dPhilomel laughed lightly and teased him.\u201c\u2026I usually pay attention to it.\u201dNassar\u2019s handsome face turned red like a carrot at Philomel\u2019s joke.\u2018It must be very embarrassing.\u2019She felt it even when she asked him to borrow money in his lifetime, but he seems to have a shy personality.\u201cAh, do I smell too? I just ran on horseback for over half a day\u2026\u201dNassar sniffed the clothes and became restless.\u201cSuch a stupid mistake\u2026\u201dThere was self-reproach in the low muttering of his voice.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m leaving. I\u2019ll put it in properly later and see you again.\u201dShe was about to reply that there was no smell, only a refreshing scent resembling that of grass, but he hurriedly stood up.\u201cI will definitely come back, so please wait.\u201dNassar leaned over to Philomel and stepped out the door.\u2018Why are you doing that? Well, how is it?\u2019It was time for Philomel to clean up the teacup herself, without even calling her maid.\u201cYour highness.\u201dThe half-open door someone pulled out and Nassar stuck his head out. Then he asked with a worried face.\u201cDon\u2019t go without me\u201dWhere else was she going? She was afraid that the main person would disappear, and she burst into a dog-like appearance that seemed to be grunting.Philomel smiled lightly.\u201cOkay. I won\u2019t be going anywhere until Nassar comes back, so please go.\u201dAnyway, as Le Guin said, until the book came there, Philomel couldn\u2019t go anywhere even if she wanted to.\u201cYou\u2019re making a promise.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cThank you!\u201dNassar gave a strong reply and disappeared. Philomel felt a different sentiment after seeing that Nassar had a little bit of a clumsy side.\u2018To think that he came all the way to the imperial palace in one step because he was worried about me.\u2019She heard that after she disappeared, Nassar eagerly traveled all over the country looking for her. Philomel\u2019s mood was a little lifted, even though she thought the biggest reason was her sense of duty as her fianc\u00e9. Even if they weren\u2019t engaged, wouldn\u2019t it be okay to say that they were friends? But the thought of Nassar soon vanished from Philomel\u2019s mind. Because she faced another problem.\u201cHow do I clean this up?\u201d\u2018I\u2019ll clean up the tea I drank with my own hands!\u2019Having the mindset itself was a first, but\u2026 She didn\u2019t even know where to put the kicks, as her maids always took care of them. If she called Ina, the maid of the Countess, she would say that she would take care of it herself, so she didn\u2019t want to call it if possible.Philomel left the room with a teapot and a tray of teacups, hoping that there would be no one around to make questions.\u201cUh.\u201dAs soon as she came out, she met the unfamiliar face of the maid. It was too strange for her to simply stand still to assume that she was passing in front of Philomel\u2019s quarters.Philomel\u2019s eyes narrowed.\u201cWhat were you doing here?\u201d\u201cPrincess! No, hey, that\u2019s\u2026 I\u2019m sorry!\u201d\u201cI asked what you were doing.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it\u2026\u201dShe couldn\u2019t answer right away, and her hesitation added to the suspiciousness of the maid\u2019s attitude.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 43": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/There Is No Place For FakesCH 43Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cHey!\u201dThen someone ran from the direction where the maid was. As far as Philomel knew, there was only one person in the imperial palace who was capable of jumping like this without being caught in the middle of the body.\u201cNassar is here? Are you still there? It must have already gone\u2026\u201dThe figure spotted Philomel in front of the maid and stopped.\u201c\u2026Princess Ellencia.\u201dPhilomel bowed her head towards Ellencia and greeted her.\u201cUh, Philomel.\u201dEllencia smiled and approached Philomel.\u201cI saw you in the morning and see you again.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cBy the way, did Nassar come here?\u201d\u201c\u2026Your Highness and he must have crossed paths.\u201dPhilomel hesitated for a moment at the title \u2018Nassar\u2019, but replied as if nothing was wrong. Thinking that he might still be nearby, Ellensia looked around. Philomel suddenly wondered if the two of them had already met each other.\u201cHave you made an appointment with the young Duke?\u201d\u201cHehe. It\u2019s not like that.\u201d, she replied shyly, with a peachy complexion on her cheeks.\u201cI heard rumors that Nassar of the Duke of Avrydon is a really nice person, so I wanted to meet him.\u201dDid that mean they haven\u2019t officially met yet?\u201cThen is this maid the maid serving Her Highness the Princess?\u201dPhilomel asked, pointing to the maid snooping at the door.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Emily saw the little Duke near and sent another maid to inform me. I ran as soon as I heard, but I was late.\u201dIt seemed that this maid\u2019s name was Emily.\u201cIf you want, you can have the maid call the little Duke.\u201dPhilomel said, frowning in one corner of her eye. Strictly speaking, it was disrespectful for her to ask someone to come without an appointment, but no one would take pity on the imperial family for committing such rudeness. Moreover, Ellencia was not just a member of the royal family, but the only daughter of an Emperor who built unprecedented power in history.\u201cAh. I\u2019m sorry, how is that?She didn\u2019t know what it\u2019s like, but she could understand her desire to see Nassar outside.Well, the meeting between the female lead and the male lead was natural.\u2018Ah, I thought of it this way again.\u2019Realizing her insidious habit, Philomel bit her lip. Since <Princess Elencia> was, of all things, a novel, she had developed a habit of treating this world as a romance novel. She was trying to fix it, but it didn\u2019t work.Ellencia, who was staring at Mel with such a feeling, asked a question.\u201c\u2026Philomel is very close with Nassar?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not too close with him, but we met often as fianc\u00e9es. But don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re not engaged anymore.\u201dPhilomel replied in a slow tone.\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s ok. Even if the two of you are close, what should I worry about?\u201dEllencia answered with a dark expression for some reason.\u201cBut I envy Philomel.\u201d\u201cWhat are you jealous of?\u201d, asked Philomel, looking down at Ellencia.\u201cThere is no maid who bothers me. I am grateful that everyone is there for me, but to be honest, it is inconvenient for me if they keep doing things for me that I can do alone. I don\u2019t need it.\u201dThen she added, \u201cI guess it\u2019s because I grew up in an environment with no one to help me. Anyway, I\u2019ll leave now. I\u2019ll have to meet with Nassar next time.\u201dSo Ellencia took her maid, Emily, and went away. Philomel\u2019s maids didn\u2019t even have time to tell her that they had only moved out of her place for a moment. Philomel thought as she watched her recede from her back.\u2018Have I been ignored?\u2019If she hadn\u2019t listened to Catherine, she would have lightly passed it off as Ellencia being so naive that she was like that. She did, but now she had an ominous feeling of discomfort running up her spine. What if she had faced Ellencsia without reading <Princess Ellencia>? Even so, would she have accepted Ellencia as a kind and lovely girl?\u2018I guess I should read that book again\u2019Maybe she should take a closer look at Ellencia\u2019s characterization.* * *\u201cOh, we\u2019ll do these things for you! Your Highness, just rest in peace.\u201dIn the end, the tray was taken away by the returning Countess Deles, and Philomel went out for a walk. To the Countess\u2019 concern that she would be in danger without an escort, Philomel pointed at her cat.\u201cIt\u2019s okay because this cat will protect me.\u201dThen the Countess Deles and her maids burst into laughter.\u201cYou\u2019re all joking.\u201dShe was not kidding. She was that cat\u2019s daughter, though, and if she was in danger, it was unlikely that Le Guin would pretend not to know her.\u2018If it was a real cat, I would have embraced it.\u2019Not wanting to carry her father around like that, Philomel asked him to follow her. Fortunately, Le Guin followed her all the way to the garden in the imperial palace without muttering.\u201cNow go back to your original form. There\u2019s no one around.\u201dAmong the many gardens in the imperial palace grounds, Philomel said as he entered the maze garden. In the past, there used to be a garden dedicated to the imperial family at the site of this labyrinth garden. It was the place where the family of the Marquis of Elos had ruined it after making fun of her.\u201cI\u2019ve seen it often, but it\u2019s kind of boring. You should decorate it in a funny way.\u201dAt that time, the garden was reborn as a labyrinth garden at the sudden instruction of the Emperor, but since Eustis did not visit the garden unless Philomel recommended it, the garden was practically hers alone. She thought about what would be the least crowded place in the imperial palace, but she could only think of this. She was worried about what would happen to her if she didn\u2019t let her in, saying that she was no longer the princess, but the guards guarding her entrance only raised their spears to show their respect.\u201cAww.\u201dHowever, Le Guin did not intend to change into his human form.\u201cWhy is that? You can change.\u201d\u201cAwww.\u201d\u201cAre you sick?\u201dThen a voice interrupted.\u201cIt\u2019s not like nobody\u2019s here, so it doesn\u2019t change.\u201dIt was a tree located next to the canopy.\u201cWho are you!\u201dStartled, Philomel shrieked sharply. Then, a person jumped down from the tree.\u201cNow that you know it is me, change. Bad tempered old man.\u201dThe man in the robe brushed the leaves off his clothes.\u2018Wait, how about that outfit?\u2019As Philomel listened, she seemed familiar with the sweet voice, which seemed to be halfway between a boy and a man.\u201cYou are the one who caught the impostor!\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dThe man\u2019s gaze turned to the voice Philomel recognized.\u201cWhat is it? Aren\u2019t you that stupid kid back then?\u201dPhilom Mel was confused, she looked at the cat and then at the man.\u201cHuh?\u201dAs the man took off the hood of his suit, a familiar face popped out. Hiser appearance, very similar to Le Guin\u2019s, showed his eyes, only a different color. It was such a cold blue.\u201cYou dare to inspire your father. The buds you haven\u2019t seen have become even more yellow, Jeremiah.\u201d\u201cHeh, pretending to be a father. Do you remember how long I\u2019ve been away from the Magic Tower?\u201d\u201cUm. A week?\u201d\u201cSix months. Don\u2019t pretend to know if you\u2019re not interested. This is inspiration.\u201dPhilomel said cautiously towards the two arguing, as if they couldn\u2019t see her.\u201c\u2026Excuse me, both of you, please stop.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not old enough to be called that yet.\u201d\u201cOriginally, the older you get, the more you want to deny your age. You\u2019re getting uglier, Le Guin.\u201d\u201cGood. You are imprisoned for 8 hours in a dark space. Go to the bathroom beforehand.\u201dBut they only growled at each other, as if they couldn\u2019t hear Philomel\u2019s voice.\u201cI want you to stop!\u201dEventually, Philomel couldn\u2019t stand it and she screamed. Only then did the magic circle above Jeremiah\u2019s head disappear. Philomel, who involuntarily made a loud noise, shut her mouth in surprise, but she didn\u2019t seem to have upset either of them.The three of them were sitting in the middle of the maze garden, under a canopy made of wood, chatting. To be precise, it was a quarrel between father and son under the guise of chatting. Philomel opened her mouth to clear things up.\u201cSo this person\u2019s name is Jeremiah, and he is the son of the lord of the mage tower. You mean this?\u201d\u201cCall me by name, not the mage tower lord.\u201dHe gave an answer completely unrelated to Le Guin\u2019s question.\u201cYes, Lord Le Guin.\u201d\u201cLe Guin.\u201d\u201c\u2026Okay, Le Guin.\u201dDid he prefer to be called by his first name without any honorifics? Come to think of it, Jeremiah also called Le Guin by his first name. Still calling her father by name\u2026 It was against Philomel\u2019s manners, but she understood that they would have their own rules.\u201cSo Jeremiah is Le Guin\u2019s son\u2026\u201d\u201cI hate to admit it, but it\u2019s true.\u201dThis time, Jeremiah, who sat crookedly, answered.\u201cI hate to admit it too. Don\u2019t go anywhere and call me my son.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t ask for money to tell you.\u201d\u201cStop, stop.\u201dAgain, Philomel, who stopped them from starting an argument, let out a small sigh. It seemed that this father and son, who looked alike as if they were printed on a plate, had a really, really bad relationship.\u201cBut Jeremiah, how did you get in here? She\u2019s guarded by the guards.\u201d\u201cBeyond the labyrinth wall. It\u2019s understandable when you see that he\u2019s not up to the level of the royal guards at the Emperor\u2019s Palace.\u201dJeremiah seemed to have a crooked personality not only with Le Guin, but with everything.\u201cThen, is Jeremiah the person Le Guin said he was supposed to meet with?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. But what about the rest of you?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. What interview are you talking about?\u201dWas there anyone else besides Jeremiah that you\u2019re supposed to meet? In front of Philomel, who tilted her head, another person appeared in the maze garden with a certain voice.\u201cThe interview passed. It was just a simple formality.\u201dThis time Philomel knew him well.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Nice to meet you, Phil.\u201dLexion answered with a smile, narrowing his eyes. But Lexion was not alone.\u201cWow! Are you Philomel?\u201dA brown-haired man accompanying him came running busily.\u201cThis person\u2026?\u201dPhilomel asked with a puzzled expression.\u201cNice to meet you! My name is Cardin! I\u2019m your eldest brother! Oh, to be precise, the eldest is Lexion, but you can just think of me first! I\u2019m the most reliable of the siblings! Wow, it\u2019s like a dream! I was young. I\u2019ve been praying for a little sister since I was little, and my wish has come true!\u201dThe man who introduced himself as Cardin circled around Philomel and spoke quickly. The green eyes were sparkling.\u201cNice to meet you, too.\u201dIn the face of the meeting with the four rich men, Philomel could only say so. Eventually, Lexion and Cardin joined her, and the five of them sat around the table under the canopy.\u201cSo what are all four of you here for?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t Le Guin tell you?\u201d\u201cWhat do you want? You always forget about important things.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dAfter listening to the conversation between Lexion and Cardin, Le Guin seems to have no trust in all three of his sons.\u201cNoisy. Introduce yourself to Phil first. All three of you are so cheeky that she\u2019ll get confused about who\u2019s who.\u201d, said the distrustful father.\u201cMaybe?\u201d\u2018As long as they have eyes, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything to worry about confusing these three unique brothers\u2026?\u2019The first person to introduce himself was Lexion.Lexion took something out of his arms and handed it to Philomel.\u201cI have already told you my name, but this is Lexion. I work in the Magic Tool Management Department. Here is my business card.\u201d\u201cOh, thank you.\u201dOn a small piece of paper, Lexion\u2019s name and the title of \u2018Secretary to the Master of the Magic Tower and Chief Magician of the Magic Tool Management Department\u2019 were written on it.Cardin took over next.\u201cI\u2019m Cardin! If it\u2019s okay with you, I\u2019d like you to call me big brother!\u201d\u201c\u2026I will try.\u201dPhilomel answered with a puzzled expression.\u201cIdiot. Introduce yourself, not your wishes.\u201dBeside him, Jeremiah clicked his tongue. Cardin added with a cheeky laugh.\u201cI am the second of these three brothers. By the way, this sulky guy is my younger brother, Jeremiah. I don\u2019t have a good personality, but when you get to know it, it\u2019s a kind side of\u2026!\u201dHis long-winded self-introduction ended there, as Jeremiah gently pressed Cardin\u2019s foot down. Lastly, Jeremiah briefly introduced himself.\u201cAs you heard, it\u2019s Jeremiah.\u201dAfter the three of them introduced themselves, Philomel asked them what she had been curious about.\u201cSo what did the three of you come here for? How did you get into the maze garden?\u201dLexion answered as a representative.\u201cFirst of all, to answer how I got in, I crossed the wall normally.\u201d\u201c\u2026yes?\u201dHe wasn\u2019t normal at all. The walls of the maze made of bushes were two heads taller than the height of an adult male. Even if he had a good motor nerve, if he was a sane person, he wouldn\u2019t even think about overstepping it.\u2018Besides, it\u2019s the garden of the royal family.\u2019Was it possible to pay an invoice after trespassing without permission?Lexion continued.\u201cIf the purpose of coming to the imperial palace is to become a court mage, what would you say?\u201d\u201cIf you are a court mage\u2026\u201dThe conversation she had with Nassar just now came to Philomel\u2019s mind. Come to think of it, he said he was accompanied by three wizards who were applying for court mage positions. And she coincidentally had the same number of siblings he had just met. Then\u2026\u2018It wasn\u2019t a coincidence.\u2019These three wizards accompanied Nassar to the capital.\u201cOriginally, we three were planning to apply, but Jeremiah said he didn\u2019t like it, so I held out.\u201d\u201cWhy should I do that? I didn\u2019t even want to come here in the first place. It was an emergency, so when I returned to the Magic Tower, they forcibly dragged me there.\u201dAt Jeremiah\u2019s grumbling, Cardin slammed the table and shouted.\u201cA younger sister! It appeared, but what if it\u2019s not an emergency! I\u2019ve always dreamed of having a younger sister! So I came running while catching the Great King Wyvern, but I don\u2019t regret it at all!\u201dLe Guin grumbled, covering his ears with his fingers.\u201cOh, it\u2019s noisy. Someone make it quiet again.\u201d\u201cIt is impossible voluntarily. Otherwise, the Mage Tower soundproof wall reinforcement work was not done.\u201dLexion replied calmly.\u2018Whoaaaaa!\u2019In the end, Cardin stopped talking only after the light emitted from Le Guin\u2019s hand hit her mouth.\u201cIt\u2019s quiet now.\u201d\u201cEup.\u201dCardin, whose whole body was restrained by the string of light, rolled on the floor and whimpered. Jeremiah, who was looking down at the formulation with his pitiful eyes, said.\u201cLexion. So how did the interview go?\u201d\u201cOf course I passed. And Cardin was close to it.\u201d\u201cTo let that idiot go through, all the court wizards have their eyes twisted.\u201d\u201cWhen Cardin grabbed the interviewer by the collar, I honestly thought he would fall. Fortunately, the qualifications required for the correspondence position are low.\u201d\u201cTo think that the son and disciple of the owner of the Mage Tower is only supplying mana to the communication stone. If this is known, Le Guin\u2019s status will fall to the ground.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s already the bottom, so there must be more to fall.\u201d\u2018Whoaaaaa!\u2019\u201cIt\u2019s fun. Tell me more.\u201dWhen the same light flowed from Le Guin\u2019s hand, the two of them shut their mouths. Philomel was a little confused. It was difficult to think that they had come simply because they wanted to occupy the imperial palace.\u2018But why?\u2019\u201c\u2026Anyway, congratulations on achieving what you wanted.\u201dIt\u2019s nice to see their faces. Lexion answered without hesitation.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that we\u2019ve seen Phil\u2019s face, so we\u2019ve achieved our goal. We became court wizards to meet you.\u201d\u201cEup-up!\u201dCardin, who was rolling on the floor, made a sound as if he agreed with the gear.\u201cYes? Wait a minute. What does it have to do with meeting me and becoming a court wizard?\u201d\u201cActually, it stemmed from a small misunderstanding.\u201dLexion did not even look at Cardin and began to explain calmly.\u201cWe heard rumors that Phil was taken by the security forces and taken to the capital, so we thought you were being taken away as a prisoner.\u201d\u201cEup!\u201dCardin sounded in agreement again.\u201cLe Guin went to see you first, but we couldn\u2019t enter this place with movement magic because of the barrier. That\u2019s why we pretended to be applicants to become court wizards.\u201d\u201cAnnoying. If you leave that to Le Guin, you will lose.\u201d\u201cWhere do you trust Le Guin to send him alone to the heart of the Empire?\u201dHe continued talking after responding to Jeremiah\u2019s complaint.\u201cAnd this morning, I learned from Le Guin\u2019s communication that you are not imprisoned and are doing well. I decided to go through an interview with Kim.\u201dPhilomel, who had been quietly listening to their story, raised her question.\u201cIf you just asked for an audience, you could have met me.\u201dConsidering Nassar\u2019s visit today, it wasn\u2019t that Philomel was not particularly forbidden from having outside visits. Lexi came back and smiled and showed his two fingers.\u201cHe had two reasons why he decided to become a court mage.\u201d\u201cWhat reasons?\u201d\u201cI thought of two possible scenarios. The first is when you want to leave this place but can\u2019t. In that case, being an insider makes it easier to get you out.\u201d\u201cWhat about the second?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s time for you to hope for someone else\u2019s opinion. The imperial palace is not a place where you can enter your mind, so we have to become court wizards so we can often face you.\u201d\u201cEup!\u201d\u201cCardin seems to feel the same way.\u201dLooking at their smiling faces, Philomel was stunned. She couldn\u2019t understand why they became a court wizard just for that reason. They said she and they were brothers, but she only knew them a few days ago. It was the first time she met Cardin.\u201cIf I said I would go to the Magic Tower right away, what were you planning?\u201dPhilomel asked in a trembling voice.\u201cYou should have written your resignation the day after you got a job, huh?\u201dThe ruined workplace of many wizards\u2019 dreams suddenly seemed shabby.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 45": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/There Is No Place For FakesCH 45Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cIt\u2019s exquisite that there are two vacant court mage positions just in time.\u201d\u201cEveryone packed their bags happily when they said that the Mage Tower would provide the best research environment.\u201d\u201cThe job of a court mage is great for honor and salary, but there are quite a few people who want to quit because of the limitations in research.\u201dIt seems that there was even an underhand operation that Philomel did not know about. Le Guin asked Lexion.\u201cYou were the one who packed Phil\u2019s luggage, right? You found it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give it to you now.\u201dLexion pulled out a familiar cloth bag from a backpack that had fallen to the floor. It was a bag that Philomel herself bought at the market. In Angelium, he inquired about Philomel\u2019s whereabouts, and he found her at an inn, and he said that he kept it.As she opened the bag he was handed to her, Philomel hesitated.\u201cHave you checked inside?\u201d\u201cPlease. I\u2019m not a ruthless person who rummages through other people\u2019s luggage.\u201d\u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mean to doubt it.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dSeeing that <Princess Elencia> was in this, she became sensitive. The book was like a shame she didn\u2019t want anyone to see. She opened the bag slightly and looked inside, and a familiar brown cover caught her eye. Fortunately, she didn\u2019t lose it.\u201cIs anything missing?\u201d\u201cNo. Thanks for bringing it to me, Lexion.\u201dPhilomel closed the bag again and answered quietly.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d\u201cThe person who brought it seems to want to say it\u2019s him.\u201d\u201cCardin, thank you too.\u201d\u201cYay!\u201dIt was kind of funny to see him actively expressing his opinion even though he was tied up tightly.\u201cIt\u2019s noisy. It talks a lot on a tied topic.\u201dPuck!\u201cEup-up!\u201dJeremiah kicked him in the ass, causing Cardin to jump.\u201cPooh.\u201dEven knowing that it would be rude to laugh at the sight of him being beaten, Philomel burst out laughing at them. The book was also in her hands again, and there was also a part of her heart that was relieved. As Philomel burst out laughing at them, the four rich men stopped all their movements and looked at her.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you smiling like that.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dLe Guin agreed with Lexion\u2019s words.\u201cMe? You must be looking at it wrong.\u201dA little embarrassed, Philomel erased her expression and let go of her pretense. Without taking her eyes off Le Guin, she put the question she had asked before into her mouth again.\u201cCome to think of it, what are you going to do now? Now that you\u2019ve found your belongings, are you going to the Magic Tower?\u201d\u201c\u2026I have to leave the imperial palace for now.\u201dShe didn\u2019t want to go to the Mage\u2019s Tower, but Philomel had to leave. A new life must be waiting for Philomel somewhere other than here where Elencia, Nanny, Catherine, and Eustis were. Because that place was not a place for her.At that time, Lexion gave a rather serious voice.\u201cPhil, what do you really want to do?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cYour face doesn\u2019t look very happy right now. Like a child with homework he doesn\u2019t want to do.\u201d\u201c\u2026It can\u2019t be. I want to leave.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dPhilomel had no answer.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to take you against your will. If you don\u2019t want to, tell me honestly.\u201d\u201cI want to take you.\u201d\u201c\u2026Le Guin, are you not going to respect Phil\u2019s will again? Have you already forgotten your work at the Mage Tower?\u201d\u201cUgh, why are you bringing that up?\u201dLe Guin glanced at Philomel, and he ruffled her hair.\u201cYes! People have to live doing what they want to do. I lived that way and I taught them to do that too.\u201d\u201cIt was a problem because you did everything you wanted to do.\u201d\u201cHa!\u201dJeremiah and Cardin, who had returned to their seats, added one word at a time.\u201cAnyway, don\u2019t look at us and decide. No, not only our notices, but if there\u2019s anything that gets in your way, ignore everything and think about what you want to do in the future.\u201d\u2018\u2026What do I want to do?\u2019Philomel blinked her eyes. She was confused. She\u2019s stuck here with an immediate reply, \u2018I want to leave this place.\u2019 She did, but she\u2019s strangely speechless, \u2018What do I want? Not what I have to do, but what I want to do.\u2019It was a very quick question to ask.Her own pure hope always took a backseat. Over the years, Philomel made big and small decisions. Most of what Philomel did was not what she wanted to do. Because she didn\u2019t want to die, she was recognized by the Emperor, and because she didn\u2019t want to die, she fled.\u2018And that\u2019s how I ended up living like that. Ugh.\u2019Philomel ran her fingers across the outside of the bag in her bosom. The outline of the leather cover was touched under the thin cloth. \u2018It was all because of this book.\u2019For the past 7 years, her most desired wish was to sleep peacefully in a place without worrying about her life. But today, Philomel saw some potential. That this book, which had influenced her life so far, might, really, possibly be wrong. It was a cruel possibility that she kept burying even though she felt it implicitly.Philomel impulsively opened her mouth without even being able to organize what he was about to say.\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve been running away from some huge facts all this time.\u201dBecause if she acknowledged that possibility, all her efforts for the past seven years would be in vain. She wondered if all the fear, resignation, worry, etc. were for nothing. She guessed it was a wrong choice not to open her heart to the people who approached her from the bottom of her heart.\u2018But now I don\u2019t want to run away. I want to know.\u2019What was the identity of this book that has wielded her for a long time, and why did it come into her hands? What truth was hidden. She wanted to face it without avoiding it anymore.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe guys didn\u2019t say anything. Ever since Philomel grew up, she had developed the habit of always chewing her tongue several times before speaking. Being the emperor\u2019s heir was such a position, and as the fake princess, she had to be even more careful.Suddenly, the words that had just come out of her mouth were ashamed. Moreover, it would have been a sound to catch a cloud if she said anything about the contents of the book.\u201cMy, if I said something that you didn\u2019t understand\u2026what does this mean?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. If it\u2019s nonsense, Le Guin always does it.\u201d\u201cThank you for being honest. To tell you the truth, I don\u2019t fully understand, but I get a sense of how you feel.\u201d\u201cOooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!\u201dPhilomel examined the faces of the three brothers in turn. No one looked puzzled or embarrassed. They just took her word for what she said. It was the same with Le Guin.\u201cOkay. I don\u2019t know the details, but you mean you have to be here to achieve what you want anyway?\u201d\u201c\u2026I think so.\u201dAll keys must belong to Ellencia. At least Philomel thought so.The main character of <Princess Ellencia> and the real princess was Ellencia. However, a girl who shows a different side than the one mentioned in the book appeared as Ellencia and Philomele\u2019s intuition whispered that something was different from the book.\u201cThen, the future policy has been decided. I want to act with Phil. Let the rest take care of themselves.\u201dPhilomel asked in surprise.\u201cAre you staying here?\u201d\u201cI told you so.\u201dHis grinning face was believable. It would be a great help if he, the owner of the Mage Tower, stayed with her. Even if the Emperor says he has no intention of killing her right now, she didn\u2019t know the future. If Le Guin could ignore the barrier, he could be able to take Philomel out with his movement magic in case of emergency.\u201cIf you stay with me for a while, you will want to go to the Mage Tower very much.\u201dHowever, he was so confident that she became anxious.\u2018\u2026Will we be able to get along?\u2019Next to Le Guin were Lexion and Cardin.\u201cI must adapt to life in the imperial palace as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cEup!\u201d\u201cThe two of you too? Is it really okay not to go back to the Mage Tower?\u201d\u201cI just got a job, but I can\u2019t quit. We will actively cooperate with what Phil is doing.\u201d\u201cOooh!\u201dA little lump of Cardin\u2019s feeling welled up in her chest. But Jeremiah\u2019s attitude was callous.\u201cTake me out. I want to go back.\u201d\u201cHe was always doused with cold water.\u201d\u201cYou must have seen the face of the newly-made man. You have seen it all.\u201dAfter hearing her father\u2019s words, he turned towards the exit of the garden.\u201cWait!\u201dWhen Philomel called him, he turned his head away.\u201cI have no personal feelings for you, but I\u2019m not into group action.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that\u2026 I want to ask you something.\u201dJeremiah nodded his chin as if to say something. Philomel hesitated but at the end she asked what she had been wondering since the beginning of the episode. She had cared about Jeremiah ever since he revealed his name.\u201cJeremiah, is your nickname the Freezing Scion?\u201d\u2018The glacier of ice.\u2019It was a nickname for a certain magician. In fact, ever since she heard his name Philomel had been questioning whether he was a Freezing Scion or not.\u201c\u2026\u201dHowever, Jeremiah\u2019s white face instantly warmed up. As if he was covering it up, he pressed down and hit the outside.\u201cDon\u2019t call me by that name!\u201d\u201c\u2026Did I excuse myself?\u201dLexion, who was giggling, stepped out.\u201cHe hates that nickname. He doesn\u2019t like it because Cardin teased him a lot with it.\u201d\u201cWhat are you laughing at!\u201dCardin smirked and kicked and ran away in her dreams to avoid her brother approaching.\u2018It was wrong to call him that.\u2019\u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t even know that\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay!\u201dShe asked just in case, but Jeremiah was really the scion of freezing.\u2018It\u2019s difficult.\u2019That situation was very embarrassing. Because Jeremiah was a mystery when he was the other male protagonist in <The Princess Ellencia>.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 46": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/There Is No Place For FakesCH 46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe mage Jeremiah.In the novel <Princess Ellencia> he was the second male lead, who loved Princess Ellencia passionately.At the end the one who took the seat next to Ellencia was Nassar, but Jeremiah was described as a noble and innocent person who secretly protected the woman he loved.The only problem is that he was a great threat to the \u2018Villainess\u2019 Philomel.There was more than once in the book that \u2018Philomel\u2019 almost got convicted by Ellensia for harassing her with the qualification that she was not a real princess.\u2018To think that the love interest was the villainess\u2019 brother \u2026?\u2019Jeremiah\u2019s family circumstances were not stated in <Princess Ellencia>, so Philomel didn\u2019t know it until now.Once the initial surprise at the realization wore off, annoyance took its place.\u2018Why didn\u2019t you mention such important information in the book!\u2019Fierce hostility toward the author of <Princess Ellencia> arose, but first Philomel had to take care of the problem at hand; second male lead Jeremiah.\u2018I\u2019m sure he won\u2019t listen to me if I tell him to stay here.\u2019Even in the book, Jeremiah was morbidly disobedient. And a rebel by nature.After considering for a while, Philomel approached Le Guin.\u201cLe Guin.\u201d\u201cYes.?\u201d\u201cYou told me to do what I want to do from now on, right?\u201d\u201cI did.\u201d\u201cThere is something I want right now, but I need your help with it. Will you help me?\u201d\u201cFinally, you see my true worth.\u201dLe Guin looked at Philomel and smiled confidently, holding her gaze.\u201cAll right. Tell me what you want me to do.\u201d\u201cPlease don\u2019t let Jeremiah go anywhere.\u201d\u201cWhat? Are you crazy? Who do you are-\u201dJeremiah didn\u2019t even get the chance to protest.\u201cGot it.\u201dWhoaaaaa!In the blink of an eye Le Guin used the same spell as before and Jeremiah shared the same fate with the brother he\u2019d ridiculed a mere moments ago.\u201cEup-up-up-up!\u201dJeremiah, whose limbs were suddenly bound, burst into anger, but fortunately, it was nothing more than a meaningless struggle against Le Guin\u2019s powerful spell.\u2018I meant, you should persuade him, not tie him up like that\u2026 \u2018It was embarrassing, but the water had already spilled. Apparently, persuasion is not in Le Guin\u2019s vocabulary, and this might be for the best.With an apologetic look, Philomel turned toward Jeremiah.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I need you to be patient, and I\u2019ll let you go when I decide what to do with you.\u201dAccording to <Princess Ellencia>, Jeremiah and Ellencia would meet in winter, three or four months before Ellencia came to the imperial palace.It may be stupid for Philomel to worry about the appearance of Ellencia and the relationship between the two, who have yet to meet.And if Jeremiah was left as he\u2019s right now, the two might never cross paths with each other.\u2018 And Ellencia is living in the palace right now, anyway.\u2019Besides, since Jeremiah has found out that she\u2019s his younger sister, there\u2019s the possibility that he won\u2019t come to hate Philomel, like in <Princess Ellencia>.However\u2026\u2018I can\u2019t let my guards down so easily\u2019Philomel, who decided to remain in the Imperial Palace for the time being, was determined to be cautious.Because there was no guarantee that Jeremiah wouldn\u2019t cross paths with Ellencia in an unexpected place and fall in love.Now that Ellensia seemed strangely hostile towards Philomel, she couldn\u2019t give her a powerful pawn, called Jeremiah.\u2018I have no choice but to keep an eye on risk factors and manage them.\u2019The best way is to appease Jeremiah. But if that\u2019s not possible\u2026\u2018If it\u2019s impossible\u2026?\u2019\u201cI\u2019m going to take care of it.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s the face you\u2019re trying to confine.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dPhilomel was trying to think of a way to persuade Jeremiah when Le Guin and Lexion chipped in with a stupid interpretation of Philomel\u2019s silence.\u201cPhil, no matter how much you want me to get rid of him, I can\u2019t do that. Instead, if it\u2019s simple confinement, I can arrange it..\u201cEup-up-up-up!\u201d\u201cEup-up-up\u201dWhen the word confinement left Le Guin\u2019s mouth, the two brothers who were tied up side by side protested by rolling on the floor.Philomel sighed softly and opened her mouth.\u201cWhy don\u2019t Lexion and Cardin go out first? Now that you\u2019ve officially become a court mage, you should take care of your duties. And Jeremiah\u2026\u201dLe Guin interrupted Philomel.\u201cWould you like me to put him into the dark space?\u201d\u201c\u2026 A place called dark space. Is it very painful to enter?\u201d\u201cNot at all. It\u2019s cozy and nice. There\u2019s nothing, so it\u2019s suitable to sit still and reflect on yourself.\u201d\u201cThen, please do so.\u201dPhilomel nodded in agreement, and decided to think about a way to deal with Jeremiah later.Le Guin snapped his fingers and Cardin was freed from his restraints.\u201cWhoa! I thought I was going to die from frustration!\u201dCardin jumped up and stretched all the way. His somewhat tanned skin further highlighted its healthy charm.\u201cPhil, call me whenever you need me! I\u2019ll drop everything and run to you at your call!\u201dPhilomel gave a slight nod to acknowledge Cardin\u2019s offer.Cardin laughed cheerfully and disappeared over the maze with Lexion.And under the canopy, only Le Guin, Philomel and Jeremiah remained.When Le Guin snapped his fingers, a magic circle appeared on the floor, and soon a black hole opened.\u201cIs this the dark space Le Guin was talking about?\u201dPhilomel peeked through the hole curiously. It was just as its name implied, a dark space without any kind of light source. Nothing more, nothing less.\u201cIt\u2019s funny.\u201dLe Guin strode up and lifted Jeremiah. Then, as if storing socks in a closet, he threw him into that dark space.\u201cEup-up-up-up-up!\u201dJeremiah, whose veins pulsated on his forehead from anger, disappeared into the hole of darkness.Philomel didn\u2019t know much about Jeremiah yet, but she guessed he probably thought; \u2018Damn you old man! I won\u2019t forget this!\u2019 she guessed that meant something.\u201cWhat are you going to do next?\u201dLe Guin clapped his palms, closing the portal to the dark space and asked Philomel.\u201cDo you have to stay at the Imperial Palace? Can\u2019t it be a mansion close to the Palace?\u201d\u201cDo you have a mansion in the capital?\u201d\u201cI can buy it.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\u2018Buying a mansion in the capital requires a huge amount of money, you know.\u2019Watching Le Guin say it so nonchalantly, Philomel realized that he was the owner of the Mage Tower who had amassed tremendous wealth.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go through that kind of trouble. Besides It\u2019s something I can only do if I\u2019m in the palace.\u201dPhilomel turned her head and tried to say something.Of course, considering the crowd who would gossip about her, the decision to stay in the imperial palace wasn\u2019t too pleasant.However, the subject she wanted to carefully observe in the future was a princess.\u2018And the princess lives in the imperial palace.\u2019Philomel could only Observe Ellencia closely when they shared the same roof. Otherwise her effort would go down the drain.\u201cSheesh, okay.\u201dAt Philomel\u2019s determined answer, Le Guin clicked his tongue, as if he couldn\u2019t help it.\u201cYou don\u2019t like the Imperial Palace, do you?Philomel asked cautiously.\u201cIt\u2019s unpleasant because there\u2019s so much divine power in the air.\u201dCome to think of it, Philomel had heard that magical power and divine power conflicted each other.Since they are in a place where all of the descendants of the sun god resided, the Imperial Place was brimming with divine power. Philomel has never felt uncomfortable in her ten years of living in the Palace, but she guessed it\u2019s different for Mages.\u201cSorry. You\u2019re going to such lengths because of me\u2026\u201dPhilomel muttered with a sullen expression. Somehow, it seemed that everything was her fault.Le Guin was stunned and denied it.\u201cNo, what? It\u2019s not unbearable.\u201d\u201cStill\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. As long as you don\u2019t approach that human, it\u2019s quite comfortable.\u201d\u201cThat human?\u201d\u201cWho is it? The person whose body overflows with nasty divine power even when they\u2019re standing still.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dPhilomel could easily tell who Le Guin was talking about.\u201cThen Le Guin should turn into a cat and go back to my room first.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause I plan to visit \u2018that human\u2019 right now.\u201dShe still had to talk to Eustis.* * *After a while, Philomel arrived at the Emperor\u2019s office and asked for an audience. She thought that he might be reluctant to meet her, but the Emperor obediently allowed her to meet him.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect to see you so soon. Did you consider my offer?\u201dHe had a dark face, but he didn\u2019t avoid her gaze like last time.\u201cYes, I\u2019ve thought about it, and I\u2019m here to give you my answer.\u201dPhilomel spoke cautiously, sitting on the sofa facing Eustis.\u201cNo. Before that, I have something to say. No matter what your answer is, I have to say it first.\u201d\u201cGo ahead.\u201dEustis lowered his eyes and opened his heavy mouth.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dHis low voice echoed in the office.\u201cI, to you\u2026 have made a big mistake. I shouldn\u2019t have said something like that so carelessly. And I sincerely apologize.\u201dHis self-deprecating apologies continued.\u201cThat\u2019s not all. I\u2019ve been so indifferent to you. I didn\u2019t even think about seeing you properly under the pretext of my misfortune.\u201dEustis slowly rose from his seat and approached Philomel.\u201cIt\u2019s too late now, but I want to ask you for forgiveness. No, you don\u2019t have to forgive me, just please don\u2019t disappear without a word. You are only sixteen. You haven\u2019t even come of age yet or had your debutante ball.\u201dEighteen was considered an adult in the Belerov Empire. And there were nearly two years left before Philomel would come of age.\u201cEven if I am not your biological father, I am still your guardian. You still need to be protected by an adult.\u201dA black gloved hand gently rested on Philomel\u2019s shoulder. It was a very careful touch.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to be with me, I will find a place that is convenient for you. So even if you don\u2019t want to see me, I want you to be within my reach. That way, I can protect you no matter what happens.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dPhilomel looked at him without saying anything.\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. There\u2019s no other suitable word other than sorry.Philomel felt a bitterness that she could not erase, seeing Eustis\u2019 frown.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her heart pounded hard.It was strange. She got an apology, but it didn\u2019t feel good. But it wasn\u2019t that bad, either.\u2018I got an apology.\u2019But that changes nothing, either way.It wasn\u2019t even Eustis\u2019 fault. Isn\u2019t it true that she is not his biological daughter? Eustis was also a victim.\u201cDon\u2019t be so hard on yourself. Even His Majesty\u2019s words can\u2019t ease my heart.\u201dPhilomel continued speaking in a light tone as if nothing was wrong.\u201cOf course, well\u2026 I was a little resentful of His Majesty at the time\u2026 but I still can\u2019t say yes to His Majesty\u2019s offer, so I think it was a natural flow after all.\u201d\u201cA natural flow?\u201d\u201cSince I\u2019m not Your Majesty\u2019s real daughter, it\u2019s inevitable that I can not help it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSilence fell between them.\u201c\u2026 I left you alone even though I thought you were my own daughter.\u201dAfter a while, Eustis spoke again.\u201cYou must have intuitively felt that I wasn\u2019t. In the first place, I don\u2019t resemble Her Majesty the late Empress at all.\u201d\u201cIt has nothing to do with that.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s related. In a way, it\u2019s natural that His Majesty didn\u2019t show affection to me.\u201d\u201cNo! Even though it may be true when you were a child\u2026\u00a0 Now I consider you my daughter. You are my daughter.\u201d\u2018Again with this, what are you saying?\u2019Philomel sneered.\u2018I think it\u2019s time to clear up the misunderstanding.\u2019\u201cIt must be an illusion.\u201dPhilomel said, surprising herself with her determined tone.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cSince we\u2019ve been together for so long, it must be that Your Majesty has become rather attached to me. And that attachment is not affecting for your daughter\u201dPhilomel was sure.It wasn\u2019t affection. It was just that he has got used to having Philomel next to himself and all the duties she did as the heir.\u2018You\u2019re mistaking it for affection\u2019Because she knew how that man treated \u2018Philomel\u2019 in <Princess Ellencia>.Of course, Philomel has her doubts about the veracity of the book now.\u201cMy feelings are an illusion\u2026 ?\u201dEustis muttered with a shocked face.He seemed very confused, so Philomel spoke soothingly.\u201cNow that Ellencia is by Your Majesty\u2019s side, you will gradually learn what it is like to have a real daughter and what a family is like.\u201dOf course, not all blood related families got along harmoniously.For example, Philomel herself couldn\u2019t confidently say that she gets along well with her biological family. However, there is a high possibility that Eustis and Ellensa are different. Their family is originally a relationship made of love.The Emperor and the Empress fell in love with, married, and gave birth to a child out of love. The rest of the book may be false, but this was the undeniable truth.\u201cAnd I don\u2019t think my relationship with His Majesty is a matter of forgiveness.\u201dIt meant that there would be no use in forgiving.\u2018If I forgave you. Are we going to go back to the old days when we were friendly only on the outside?\u2018What if I don\u2019t forgive you? Are you going to get revenge on me for impersonating the imperial Princess and punish me along with my mother?\u2019So, this problem is over. And this is the end of Philomel\u2019s relationship with him.\u201cPlease forget about all my right and wrong doings and please let go of any resentments.\u201d\u201cPhilomel\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright to forget everything and go our separate ways. Besides, the role of my guardian can be taken by someone else like Countess Deles, so that Your Majesty doesn\u2019t have to trouble himself.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dA vast silence overcame the room. It was a distance that could never be narrowed.\u2018Originally, I wanted to cleanly cut our relationship off like this, but\u2026\u2019Philomel hesitated for a moment before opening her mouth.\u201cBut\u2026 If Your Majesty feels sorry for me even a little or has good feelings left, would you please allow me a request?\u201dEustis raised his head and looked at Philomel.\u201cWhat is it? Whatever you like, tell me.\u201d\u201cI am trying to live on my own from now on. But I\u2019m a bit at a loss as to where to begin and I have no place to stay right now.\u201dOn the way to the office, she continued to think about suitable excuses to stay in the imperial palace, but she could only come up with this.\u201cCountess Deles said it would be okay to live with her in the county Deles\u2026 But I declined. Since the countess was my lady in waiting, she\u2019ll continue to treat me like a princess, so\u2026\u201dPhilomel looked at the Emperor carefully and continued talking.\u201cIf Your Majesty doesn\u2019t mind, could I stay at the imperial palace for a while longer? If Your Majesty could provide me with the accommodation for maids, I\u2019ll use it responsibly.\u201dPhilomel added one last part as to not appear to be seriously considering to continue living in the palace, as suggested by the Emperor.\u201cOf course, until I establish my footing outside of the palace. I won\u2019t bother Your Majesty for long!\u201dOnce the doubts about Ellencia and the book are resolved, Philomel\u2019s going to leave without delay.\u201cYou can stay as long as you want. However, I can\u2019t allow accommodation for maids.\u201dEustis replied with a firm expression on his face.\u201cThen where\u2026?\u201dThe Western palace, currently used by Philomel, was a residence for the successor. However, since it was revealed that she was not the real Princess, she had to give the place to Ellencia.\u201cI\u2019m going to prepare the southern palace, so stay there.\u201d\u2018Southern palace?\u2019Philomel tilted her head.If it was the southern palace, it was the accommodation provided to state guests visiting the Empire.\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t make sense for me to stay at the southern palace, since I am not a state guest.\u201dThe Southern Palace is a state guesthouse that only members of the royal family or high nobility from other countries can use during their stay here.The southern Palace boasted with such high standards that, if the visiting country didn\u2019t possess enough power, they would reside in a general guest room and not in the state guest house, the southern Palace.\u201cWhy do you think you\u2019re not a state guest?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m no longer a Princess\u2026\u201d\u201cEven if you don\u2019t want to be my daughter, I don\u2019t intend to betray the grace I owe you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Grace?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you the benefactor who found Ellencia and reunited her with me? You found out that she was buried in the wilderness, possibly for the rest of her life, so if it weren\u2019t for you, I would have lived my whole life without knowing the existence of her.\u201dWords flowed out of the Emperor\u2019s mouth uninterrupted. It was an eloquent speech that seemed to have been prepared in advance.\u201cBesides, unless you let yourself be registered as a royal descendant, she is the Emperor\u2019s only child and heir. Not only me, but the whole Empire has received a favor that cannot be easily repaid.\u201dIs that how it works?\u2018Benefactor\u2019Philomel was bewildered because she had never thought of it that way before. Even if no one is to blame, she has lived as the child of a sinner all her life.The Emperor continued without hesitation.\u201cIf I don\u2019t treat the benefactor of the Empire accordingly, everyone will curse me out for years to come, for being less than a beast. Are you going to paint me as a beast in future history books?\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s true that philomel was involved to a degree. And listening to Eustis\u2019 words made it somehow difficult to refuse.In fact, it was more beneficial for Philomel to use a large room. It doesn\u2019t matter if she\u2019s alone in the attic, but She needs a separate space for her father who\u2019s wearing a cat\u2019s mask.After much contemplation, Philomel eventually accepted his offer.\u201c\u2026 Then I\u2019ll go to Southern Palace.\u201dThus, Philomel decided to stay at the southern palace however long she wanted to.The decision to draw attention was obvious, but\u2026 It was something she had been determined to do from the moment she decided to stay in the imperial palace.Afterward, Philomel requested that her captive maids be freed.The Emperor was reluctant, but he promised to release them.Their conversation eventually came back to the matters related to Philomel\u2019s stay in the southern Palace. Although the Emperor and Philomel had different opinions about the accommodation provided in the southern Palace, most of them were decided in Philomel\u2019s favor.\u201cPhilomel.\u201dJust as Philomel was leaving the office, a serious call stopped her at the door.\u201cI\u2019ll take this as an opportunity.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI will definitely prove to you that what I said is not a lie.\u201d\u2018So I want you to think about it again during your stay here.\u2019He didn\u2019t say the second part out loud but Philomel clearly heard it.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019ll take my leave now. Have a nice afternoon, Your Majesty.\u201dPhilomel left the room without taking another glance back.\u2018I\u2019ve done enough.\u2019It was not her fault that the Emperor had false expectations.\u2018He\u2019ll give up sooner or later.\u2019\u201cHey, Philomel. Are you coming to see father?\u201dAs soon as she left the office, Philomel ran into Ellencia. She seemed to be on her way to see Eustis.\u201cYes, actually we just finished discussing the registration that you suggested the other day.\u201dPhilomel bowed to Ellencia as a greeting and replied.\u201cReally? Have you decided to be registered?\u201dEllencia with sparkles in her eyes asked. She seemed to be very interested in Philomel\u2019s registration.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, your Highness, but I declined.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 Why? I wanted to spend more time with Philomel\u2026\u201dThe well-shaped golden eyebrows drooped. Seeing the disappointment on her face, Philomel wondered if that was really true.\u2018I want to know what Ellencia is like.\u2019\u201cIt\u2019s not a suitable seat for me, but don\u2019t be too sad, your highness.\u201dEllencia\u2019s blue eyes were stained with wonder.\u201cAlthough I declined to register, I\u2019ve decided to stay in the imperial palace for the time being. Thankfully, His Majesty the Emperor has decided to provide me with the state guesthouse at the southern palace.\u201dIn an instant, Philomel\u2019s expression softened. What was left was a bare face, resembling an empty drawing paper.\u201cI\u2019m really happy that I can continue to see the Princess who thinks so highly of me. Isn\u2019t the Princess happy too?\u201dShe wasn\u2019t sure exactly what kind of person Ellencia was, but looking at her face, Philomel was certain.She doesn\u2019t want Philomel to stay in the Palace.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If you refused to register, then Philomel wouldn\u2019t be the Princess.\u201dEllencia quickly adjusted her expression and asked with a smile.Philomel felt that smile was somehow very forced.\u201cIs there any rule that says only Princesses can stay in the Palace?\u201d\u201cBut, as far as I know, only state guests can use the state guest House\u2026\u201d\u201cAs you said, however, I was recognized for my contribution and became a state guest.\u201dPhilomel boldly decided to announce. It looks like this way she might be able to learn more about Ellencia.\u201c\u2026 Contribution ?\u201d\u201cYes, the contribution of bringing Princess Ellencia to His Majesty the Emperor. His Majesty was very grateful, saying that if it wasn\u2019t for me, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to meet the Princess.\u201d\u201c\u2026 aha. That\u2019s what you mean.\u201d\u201cIt is truly an honor that the Princess has been able to return to her original place with my little help.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 I guess. Thank you.\u201dIt was a short thank-you and a not long useless chatter.A moment of silence fell between them.The image of Ellencia talking nonstop throughout the dice game and the image of her so silent right now, was very contrarily.Philomel was about to say goodbye, when Ellencia spoke again in a small voice.\u201cHow long are you going to stay in the Southern Palace?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Well, until I feel like it? I want to stay for as long as possible. That way I can meet with Princess Ellencia more often.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great. I wanted to talk more with Phlomel, too.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s very reassuring that the Princess feels the same.\u201dIt was a conversation that didn\u2019t contain a grain of sincerity.With this level of stimulation, Ellencia\u2019s true face still could not be seen.\u2018Shall I dig a little further?\u2019Philomel stared at Ellencia\u2019s face and opened her mouth.\u201cCome to think of it, I met \u2018Catherine Hounds\u2019 who was imprisoned today.\u201d\u201cCatherine?\u201dEllencia, who asked reflexively, immediately added in an apologetic tone.\u201cOh, my mother. When my mom lived with me, she used a different name\u2026 \u201cAs far as Philomel knows, Catherine didn\u2019t change her first name.\u201cSo, what about mom?\u201d\u201c\u2026 She seemed to miss the Princess a lot. She was anxiously looking for you, calling you Ellen.\u201dHearing that Ellencia put her hands together over her face and started to sniffle.\u201cI also wanted to go to see my mom\u2026 but my dad wouldn\u2019t let me. My heart aches when I think of how much my mother is suffering there.\u201dIt seems Ellencia completely forgot about Catherine\u2019s existence until Philomel brought it up. .\u201cIs mom well? Did she look sick? Is she eating well?\u201dEllencia\u2019s eyes were watery as she mournfully asked for Catherine\u2019s safety.\u201cShe was haggard, but fortunately she didn\u2019t seem to be in any serious pain.\u201d\u201cReally? I\u2019m glad then.\u201d\u201cBut she said some strange things.\u201d\u201cWhat strange things?\u201cWhat did she say\u2026\u201d Philomel pretended to recall Catherine\u2019s words.\u201c\u2026 ah she said that from a certain point on, Princess Ellencia suddenly became like a different person?\u201d\u201c\u2026 What did you say?\u201dIt was only for a moment, but Philomel witnessed it clearly. Ellencia\u2019s perfect face painted with the act of filial piety was distorted.Perhaps feeling Philomel\u2019s gaze, Ellencia hurriedly closed her eyes and regained her composure.She tapped Philomel on the shoulder and said lightly.\u201cWhat are you talking about? What does she mean, someone else? It can\u2019t be. She must have said nonsense because she is sick and can\u2019t think clearly..\u201dWhat Philomel just had said about Catherine not being sick must not have been memorable enough.\u2018As expected\u2026 Suspicious.\u2019A corner of Philomel\u2019s heart sank coldly.\u201cMore than that, I\u2019m very worried about my mom. What if I get in big trouble if I keep going like this? I think I need to get her out of prison quickly.\u201dEllencia murmured quickly.\u201cYes? Getting her out? That person\u2019s sins are hard to forgive\u2026\u201dIt was then.\u201cI can ask my dad! Dad will forgive her if I earnestly ask for it.\u201dAnd before Philomel could stop her, she ran in the direction of the Emperor\u2019s office.\u2018No!\u2019Philomel, realizing what Ellencia was about to do, ran after her.Eustis hates Catherine. It\u2019s a miracle that she\u2019s still alive.How ridiculous to Worry about Catherine in front of Eustis, even begging him to release her?It was the same as begging Eustis to kill her.Even in <Princess Ellencia>, there are several scenes where Eustis grinds his teeth while looking at his daughter, who missed the dead Catherine.\u201cIf I could, I\u2019d like to get her out of her grave and kill her again.\u201dThe reason the Emperor couldn\u2019t fulfill his wish was because there was no tomb for Catherine\u2019s corpse that had become a crow\u2019s meal.\u201cWait a minute! Your Highness!!\u201dPhilomel shouted loudly, but Ellencia, who arrived at the end of the hallway, did not look back.Philomel gritted her teeth and ran down the hallway.Philomel didn\u2019t want Catherine to die.It wasn\u2019t just because she was her mother, however, Philomel\u2019s conscience wouldn\u2019t be at ease if she died because of what she said.Philomel still had many questions to ask her. How has Ellencia changed, and what secrets is Ellencia hiding?Catherine was an absolutely necessary informant for Philomel to dig further in Ellencia\u2019s past.\u201cWhy is she so fast?\u201dAfter a while, Philomel gasped and barely reached the office.Through the door that Ellencia had partially left open, she could see two figures. Ellencia was already clinging to her father.\u201cDad! Please! Please release my mother from prison!\u201d\u2018I\u2019m doomed.\u2018As Philomel tried to open the door completely and enter, her arms fell helplessly to the floor.She couldn\u2019t stop it at all.She felt guilty that she had provoked Ellencia too hastily.\u201c\u2026is that really what you want?\u201dThe Emperor looked down at his daughter with meaningful eyes. He looked complicated and, in a way, worried.\u201cYes! I love my mother\u2026 I know my father hates her, but to me, she is more like a mother than my real mother who gave birth to me.\u201d\u2018Oh my god.\u2019Philomel bit her lip.\u2018There\u2019s something one should say and other things that one shouldn\u2019t say. At this rate, why don\u2019t you simply ask him to kill Catherine?\u2019How much Eustis loved the former empress was a story known to the entire empire. Why would you say something like that there?Also, didn\u2019t Catherine swap Ellencia and Philomel?The figure of Catherine on the scaffold flickered in front of Philomel\u2019s eyes.\u201cI will ask you one last time. Is that really what you want?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201dEustis closed his eyes and fell silent. He felt deep anguish.Then, he found Philomel standing in front of the door.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Do you still have something to say?\u201d\u201c\u2026 no. While I was talking with Her Highness, Her Highness suddenly ran away, so I followed her because I was worried that she might be sick.\u201d\u201cNot really. Anyway, you came at the right time.\u201dIn time? What do you mean?\u201cSit down, Ellencia, you too.\u201dPhilomel and Ellencia looked at each other in bewilderment and then sat down at the table.\u201cPolan, are you there?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201dEustis gave a separate order to Count Polan, who was waiting outside the door, and soon about ten people came to the office.They ranged from knights to maids. All in common were those who worked in the palace. Among them was the prison guard Philomel met this morning. He was the one in charge of Catherine.The last to enter the office was Count Pollan.\u201cI couldn\u2019t bring the nanny because she is currently unable to move.\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped. Ellencia, take responsibility for delivering it. She is the one who keeps being under your middle name.\u201dPhilomel was surprised.\u2018You gave your middle name to keep the nanny in the palace?\u2019The middle name of the royal family was not ordinary, but a name given by God.It is said that when the founding Emperor received a revelation from God to establish the country, he was given a new name by God.Since then, his descendants prayed to God when a child was born and attached the name that came down as an oracle as a middle name for the new born.These days, oracles have become more rare, so the middle name of royal descendants are instead chosen from a list with appropriate names recommended by the government. But the symbolism and power the middle name of the royal family holds is enormous, even now.It meant that Ellencia did not only bet on the honor of a member of the imperial family, but also on the grace bestowed by God.Since each and every member of the royal family is a descendant of a god, even the Emperor could not afford to mention his middle name recklessly.Of course, middle names were not all-powerful. There were some cases where the middle name was bet on dishonest and wrong things, and as a result they lost their divine power.Philomel, who had no divine power since birth, heard rumors about those cases, but to think\u00a0 that the royal family lost their divine power due to such disgraceful incidents?\u2018It\u2019s over as a royal Princess. Plus the social burial.\u2019The nanny was not worth it for Ellencia to bet her middle name on.\u2018Moreover, Ellencia\u2019s middle name is really cool!\u2019According to <Princess Ellensia>, at dawn on the day Ellencia first appeared, the High Priestess received God in a dream and heard a certain name.When the High Priestess later heard that the real princess had appeared, she then realized that the name was the middle name of the princess.Presumably, even though Philomel brought her appearance a year earlier, the High Priestess seemed to have been revealed with the same middle name.In other words, Ellencia was wasting the grace of a true god, which was rare.\u2018If you\u2019re going to waste it like that, why not just give it to me!\u2019Philomel shouted in her heart.Philomel\u2019s middle name is just an appropriate name for Emperor Meitias, who first ascended the throne as a woman.So, when Philomel was young, there was a time when she envied a real middle name to the point of asking if there was anything entrusted to her whenever she met a high priest or priestess.\u201cDad, why did you call them?\u201dThe sound of Ellencia looking around and asking, awakened Philomel from her flashback.The Emperor answered his daughter\u2019s question.\u201cI\u2019m trying to grant your wish.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 49": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/There Is No Place For FakesCH 49Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cMy wish?\u201dEllencia asked with a puzzled look on her face.Instead of answering his daughter\u2019s question, Eustis looked at the people in the room.\u201c16 years ago from now. My wife closed her eyes while giving birth.\u201dThere was a solemn atmosphere in the room at the mention of the former Empress.Unhealed scars were visible on the profile of the man who was bringing up the past.\u201cThe place where the child was born was the house of Catherine Hounds, an old friend of my wife. At the time, Catherine also had a newborn baby.\u201dNo one could even guess why Eustis was bringing up the past.Until they heard his next words.\u201cOn that day, my child, and Catherine\u2019s were switched. By mistake.\u201dEveryone except the one who spoke took a deep breath.\u2018What?\u2019Philomel, too, opened her eyes wide in surprise.\u201cBut Your Majesty\u2026!\u201dIt was the youngest maid who dared to question. However, as everyone gave her a harsh look, she hastily bowed and shut her mouth.In the silence, Ellencia opened her mouth with a trembling voice.\u201cWhat do you mean by that? I\u2019m sure my mom had some purpose\u2026\u201d\u201cEllencia.\u201dEustis looked at his daughter with unusually dark eyes.\u201cIf it\u2019s her fault, she\u2019ll have to pay for her sins with her death.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201dEllencia looked around and shut her mouth.She seems to have realized it. She has no choice but to go with it to save Catherine, like she requested.Philomel also realized. What do the people gathering here have in common?These were the ones who knew that Catherine had deliberately swapped the two children; not from rumors, but from harsh facts.Presumably, the nanny was called to the palace to see if Ellencia looked like the empress.The book went through a similar verification process.And maybe Catherine, who was captured and brought in front of Eustis, confessed her sins and turned it from a rumor into facts.Considering that the time when Countess Deles witnessed Catherine coincided with the time at which the nanny appeared at the Imperial Palace, it is a persuasive guess.\u2018The knights must be the ones who captured Catherine, and the maids must be the ones who serve Ellencia.\u2019The nanny must have cursed Catherine so much that the maids next to her couldn\u2019t not know by now. It was obvious without looking.\u201cCatherine didn\u2019t know that the child had been changed at first\u2026 \u201cAt this point, I could feel the Emperor grinding his teeth.\u201cAs time went by, she found out the truth when she saw how much the child resembled the late Empress. And when she met Philomel by chance, she confessed.\u201dWith this, the cover story was completed.The Emperor made eye contact with each one of them.\u201cI know what\u2019s in the air right now. Soon it\u2019ll be a subdued rumor. If not\u2026\u201dThe Emperor didn\u2019t continue, however everyone could imagine what he would have said next with one glance at his fierce expression and daring eyes.\u201cI trust that everyone will take care of it themselves.\u201d* * *After the Emperor\u2019s non-threatening threats were over, everyone returned to their work.When Count Polan withdrew, there were only three people left in the office.\u201cWith this, that woman will no longer be the subject of public trial or punishment.\u201dEustis said in a low voice.\u201cBut since the sins committed will not fade away like this, she won\u2019t be able to escape imprisonment. However, I\u2019ll have her transferred to a better environment than right now, like you wished.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cEllencia?\u201dEllencia was lost in thought, and at the call of her name she came back to her senses.\u201cOh, yeah\u2026\u00a0 thank you for granting me my wish! Above all, I\u2019m happy\u00a0 that my dad thinks of me this much.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d\u201cI have to pass this good news on to my nanny. I\u2019ll go first.\u201dEllencia quickly left the office after pouring out her words.When Ellencia left, only Eustis and Philomel remained in the office.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIn the awkward silence, Philomel spoke first.\u201cWhy\u2026 Did you make that decision for Ellencia?\u201dIn the book, he couldn\u2019t overcome his anger and killed Catherine immediately and even took care of the body.Philomel swallowed the unsaid words.Eustis announced that he would cover the sins of the woman who had replaced his daughter a moment ago.For over sixteen years, he did not know the daughter his wife gave birth to in exchange for her life, because of Catherine. Philomel\u2019s sure it isn\u2019t easy to just let the sinner go like that.\u201cOkay.\u201dHe replied calmly.\u201cNo one will hold your mother accountable, so don\u2019t shrink for nothing. Originally, you weren\u2019t meant to feel responsible at all.\u201dWas it just Philomel or did Eustis also take her into consideration in covering up for Catherine\u2019s crime?That\u2019s ridiculous. Philomel is reading too much into his words.\u201c\u2026 I see.\u201dSo, Philomel returned to her quarters in a rather complicated mood.\u201cThen you\u2019re staying here all the time?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201dWhen Philomel told her remaining maids that their imprisoned colleagues would soon be freed, they were overjoyed.They were all the more delighted at the news of Philomel\u2019s longer stay.\u201cThen we should postpone the invitation to our territory until later.\u201dCountess Deles said with a smile.\u201cI will definitely go when I have time.\u201dCount Deles wanted to visit in peace after finishing their business here.\u201cIt is a promise. But if you want to move to the Southern Palace, I have to pack your things right away.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t be taking much belongings.\u201dPhilomel didn\u2019t have any lingering feelings about most of the stuff in the eastern Palace, as she threw them away once already when she ran away.\u2018They\u2019re not even mine.\u2019Everything Philomel had ever eaten, worn, or possessed was not meant to be hers.Even people were like that. So it\u2019s only right to return it to its original owner, Ellencia.\u201cMeow.\u201dAt that very moment, the only entity unrelated to Ellencia approached Philomel and pretended to know her.\u2018Ah, there is still this person.\u2019Philomel silently stroked the cat\u2019s head, then spoke to everyone.\u201cThank you for all the work you have done for me. From now on, I\u2019m trying to lighten your burden.\u201dAt Philomel\u2019s words everyone stopped in their tracks and looked at her like she had grown a second head.Countess Deles then asked with a puzzled expression.\u201cExcuse me, but what do you mean\u2026 \u201c\u201cI mean that if you go to the Southern Palace with me, you don\u2019t have to take care of me as closely as you do now. You can only do the work given at the appointed time according to the rules for the royal guests.\u201dCountess Deles and the maids were visibly embarrassed. It was unreasonable that Philomel, who had people waiting for her ever since she was born, suddenly declared that she would not accept it.\u201cYes, however, the reason for why those rules got established is because the state guests staying at the Southern Palace always brought their private servants.\u201dThat\u2019s right.It is unlikely that the distinguished guests, each of whom was a guest of the imperial palace, would not bring their own servants. Of course, it was a rule for the convenience of the guests, as the servants that originally served them were more like limbs than courtiers.\u201cAre you thinking of hiring other servants?\u201dPhilomel shook her head.\u201cI\u2019ll do it myself as far as I can.\u201dStanding alone.Philomel intends to use the period of her stay in the Imperial Palace to finally learn and stand on her own feet.She has grown up as a flower in the Imperial greenhouse under the Emperor\u2019s shadow.She felt it in her few days of escape. She didn\u2019t know how to bargain, so it was common to go overboard in the market, and if it wasn\u2019t for Jeremiah, all of her money would have been stolen. It was like experiencing it firsthand what she had only learned in theory.\u2018I thought I was all grown up, but I still have a long way to go.\u2019From basic grocery shopping to tips on choosing a safe place to stay.If it weren\u2019t for the people who were willing to lend a helping hand to her wandering around, not knowing how to do anything, she wouldn\u2019t have survived even a single day, let alone a few days.So, during her stay in the Palace, Philomel wants to do something meaningful other than finding out where Ellencia lived through a book. She wants to become her own whole person.To do that, she has to distance herself from the things she had taken for granted until now.\u201c\u2026 Are you sure you don\u2019t mind? The Southern Palace is too big. It will take a day just to clean up.\u201dNancy, the maid, expressed her concern.\u201cI just have to not make too much of a mess. And it\u2019s not like you all won\u2019t be able to serve me at all.\u201dThe state guest staying at the Southern Palace, entrusted the Palace courtiers with basic chores, once or twice a day. Which included cleaning and laundry.Actually, Philomel wanted to do everything herself, but it\u2019s impossible with one person\u2019s strength. Nobles didn\u2019t have so many servants just for show.\u201cIt must be hard though\u2026\u201dAt the words of the maid who was concerned about her, Philomel grinned and said,\u201cIf I can\u2019t fix it, I\u2019ll call you guys. Help me then.\u201dAll that was left was to clean up the dishes she ate and brew the tea on her own, but everyone was very worried.After the maids had reached some understanding, it was Countess Deles\u2019 turn.\u201c\u2026 What should I do? It seems that Philomel does not need me anymore.\u201dCountess Deles muttered self-deprecatingly.As an aristocrat, she couldn\u2019t do chores like the maids. She was done with her role when Philomel ceased to be the princess in the first place.And even now that Philomel is an honored guest, countess Deles couldn\u2019t serve her as her lady-in-waiting, since she\u2019s not a member of the Imperial Family.\u201cMadam can now rest in ease. You haven\u2019t even seen the face of your daughter yet, have you? I\u2019d like you to go back to the manor and spend time with your family for the time being.\u201dPhilomel said the words she wanted to say before the sadness formed on her face.\u201cAnd come back and be my friend. Not as those who serve and those who are served, but equals.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201d\u201cFrom now on, since I\u2019m no longer a princess, there will be fewer and fewer people visiting. So you should often come and spend time with me.\u201dCountess Deles replied with a choked voice.\u201cYes. I will.\u201dAfterward, at Philomel\u2019s request, the Countess, and the maids gathered together for dinner.Everyone hesitated at the unconventional shape, but in the end, they accepted seeing Philomel\u2019s stubbornness.It was a bustling evening.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019ll be staying at the State guest house for now.\u201dPhilomel answered, pulling the blanket up to cover her body with.\u201cHmm. The southern building has weaker divine power than here, so that\u2019s good for me.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cBy the way, will you really be okay without any attendants? Well, I\u2019d be more comfortable that way.\u201d\u201cActually, that is one of the reasons why I\u2019m not taking any attendants. Since we all will meet more often in the futur- \u201cPhilomel suddenly stopped mid sentence.Strangely, she felt uncomfortable.It felt like she had forgotten something important.\u201cWhy did you stop talking?\u201d\u201cUhm, I forgot something, didn\u2019t I?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201dSuddenly a figure came to Philomel\u2019s mind when she looked at Le Guin\u2019s face, who lifted one eyebrow casually.A cold shiver ran down Philomel\u2019s spine at that moment, she kicked the covers off and stood up and exclaimed horrified.\u201cOh! Jeremiah!\u201dShe had completely forgotten about Jeremiah, who had been put in the dark space.***Jeremiah, now outside of the dark space, still had his limbs restrained\u201c\u2026Je, Jeremiah?\u201dHis eyes flickered open at Philomel\u2019s call.He glared at them terrifyingly with his blue eyes. He seemed very angry, and rightfully so.The original plan was to talk to Eustis and then come back and release Jeremiah. But as Ellencia intervened and Catherine\u2019s problem came to light, Jeremiah was forgotten.This is not good. She was going to be hated by him before she had the chance to get on his good side.\u201cUh, please release him quickly\u2026\u201dPhilomel urged Le Guin and hid behind his back.\u201c\u2026\u201dJeremiah, who Philomel thought was going to run wild the second he was freed, was calm for some reason. But he still glared at Philomel and Le Guin in turn.\u201cWhy are you squinting so hard?\u201c\u2026\u201dAs if rebelling against his father\u2019s words, he narrowed his eyes even more.\u201cDon\u2019t do that. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dPhilomel mustered up her courage and stepped forward. It was the courage given by the so-called \u2018secret weapon\u2019 in her hand.\u201cJeremiah! I\u2019m sorry I took you out so late! It\u2019s a small gift, but would you please accept it?\u201dPhilomel held out a plate with cookies. She always had snacks in her room to eat whenever she was hungry.\u201cHumph\u201dBut Jeremiah jerked his head away.\u201cYou must be hungry, so please eat something first.\u201dNo response.\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026pretty good. It has got a lot of chocolate in it.\u201dPhilomel murmured in a small voice as if trying to coax a small child.\u201cWhat about me? Why aren\u2019t you giving me some?\u201dLe Guin frowned and asked from the side. It seemed that he didn\u2019t like the fact that she didn\u2019t offer him cookies.\u201cYou\u2019ve had the dinner I prepared for you, didn\u2019t you?Philomel, feeling a bit tired, responded by pressing her a finger between her brows.\u201cThat\u2019s that, and this is this.\u201dThis man may be the Mage Tower Master but he really acted like a child.But then an opportunity presented itself.\u201cWhat is with this act? What the hell are you two trying to pull off in front of me-\u201cWhen Jeremiah opened his tightly closed mouth, Philomel quickly pushed a cookie in.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dHe chewed the food in his mouth steadily, with a frown.Soon, a light shone in his blue eyes.\u201c\u2026 it\u2019s all right to eat.\u201d\u201cEat more.\u201d\u201cIf you think I\u2019m going to let everything go this easily-\u201cPhilomel quickly pushed another one in, so Jeremiah had no choice but to munch on it.After swallowing the cookie, he opened his mouth again.\u201cThat\u2019s enough. You can stop now-.\u201dThis time, Philomel pushed three cookies all at once. The sight of Jeremiah munching on cookies with stuffed cheeks and occasional mumbling, reminded Philomel of a hamster.\u201cYou\u2019re thirsty, aren\u2019t you? I\u2019ll get you a cup of water.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dPhilomel poured water into a cup and held it out for Jeremiah, he cleared his throat and accepted it without any fuss.\u2018If you eat cookies, you\u2019ll get thirsty!\u2019After a few \u2018huffs\u2019 and \u2018puffs\u2019, Jeremiah, now with a full stomach, said.\u201c\u2026 hmm. Now why don\u2019t you stop with this ridiculous act already, if you have something to say, say it quickly.\u201dContrary to his semi cold words, the angle of Jeremiah\u2019s raised eyebrows became gentler than before. His anger has subsided to a degree.\u201cYou have quite an appetite.\u201dLooking at the cleanly empty cookie plate, Le Guin complained from the side.But Philomel, who was relieved at her success, didn\u2019t pay him any attention.She was happy at the fact that sweet food worked well on the picky Jeremiah.Jeremiah, the Prince of Ice.He is a glutton for food although he denies it. Especially sweets.Philomel knew this fact because it was mentioned in <Princess Ellencia>.The Ellencia in the book, broke through the walls surrounding Jeremiah\u2019s heart with a sweet dessert.Jeremiah\u2019s importance in the book was not high because the male lead was Nasar, but his love for dessert was so intense that Ellencia always gave him something sweet to munch on in every scene he appeared in.\u2018It\u2019s good. If I make good use of this fact, I might be able to turn Jeremiah to my side!\u2019A brilliant plan formed in Philomel\u2019s head.\u201cHey, are you listening? Why did you lock me up?\u201dPhilomel bowed in apology again at Jeremiah\u2019s question.\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. It must have been really uncomfortable, right? It was very wrong of me to leave you there like that.\u201d\u201cNo, well\u2026 you\u2019re not the only one to blame. In the end, it was Le Guin who put me in\u2026\u201dAnother piece of information about Jeremiah mentioned in the book was that he wasn\u2019t cruel to those who admitted their mistakes and reflected on them. Even if Ellencia made a mistake, he accepted it if she apologized properly.\u201cBut I\u2019m still sorry.\u201d\u201cSo tell me why did you do that?\u201dJeremiah\u2019s eyebrows are now perfectly in place, indicating he wasn\u2019t angry anymore.\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026\u201dPhilomel cautiously opened her mouth.***The next morning was a bright sunny day.\u201cGood morning, Miss Philomel.\u201dAfter waking Philomel up, Countess Deles, who was looking around the bedroom with wide eyes, asked.\u201cWhere is the cat?\u201dPhilomel responded with a yawn.\u201cIt went out the window. I guess sleeping outside is more comfortable.\u201d\u201cWell, since he was originally a stray cat, that might be the case.\u201dIn truth, Le Guin was dragged outside after being grabbed by Jeremiah last night.Philomel asks Jeremiah to stay with her for one more day.\u201cWhat? So you locked me up because you wanted to talk to me more?\u201dJeremiah asked shockingly at Philomel\u2019s poor excuse for a cover up.But he didn\u2019t get angry.\u201c\u2026 If that\u2019s the case, just say it. There\u2019s no reason for me not to stay a day or two longer to listen to you.\u201dHis reaction, sighing and scolding lightly, was quite unexpected.\u2018I see, so you\u2019ll listen to me even if I don\u2019t make big excuses.\u2019Philomel blinked and thought.She inadvertently thought that it wouldn\u2019t be easy to get on Jeremiah\u2019s good grace since he was so hostile towards the Philomel in the book.\u201cAnyway, it\u2019s late at night, we can talk more tomorrow.\u201dJeremiah said, looking at the clock and picked his father, who had\u00a0 turned into a cat in the meantime, up and headed toward the terrace entrance.\u201cWhy are you offering us to stay here when you don\u2019t have a single room for us to stay at?\u201dThe cat scowled, but when Philomel agreed with Jeremia, he eventually went along. And they disappeared through the terrace window.Only after closing the window did Philomel finally feel at ease.She was thankful that Jeremiah had enough courtesy to go somewhere else for tonight and take Le Guin with him. It was quite uncomfortable to share a bedroom with her biological father, who had turned into a cat.Furthermore\u2026\u201cYou talk a lot in your sleep.\u201dLe Guin\u2019s fleeting comment yesterday made Philomel even more uncomfortable.\u2018I didn\u2019t know that I still have such a sleeping habit.\u2019When she was a child, her nanny nagged her about not being able to sleep well because of her sleep talking.But she hadn\u2019t heard anyone mention it since the nanny\u2019s departure, so Philomel thought she had grown out of that habit.Looking back, she was eight by the time the nanny was fired. She always slept alone afterward, so others didn\u2019t have a chance to notice her sleeping habits.\u2018I can\u2019t believe my inner feelings are leaking out without my knowledge\u2026 I hate it. I don\u2019t want anyone to know.\u2019\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful day. What do you want to do today?\u201dAt that time, Countess Deles opened the window to let fresh air in and asked.Philomel looked at her warm face for a moment before replying.\u201cI\u2019m going to rest quietly all day today. It seems the fatigue from traveling hasn\u2019t worn off yet.\u201d\u201cThen I will make sure no one disturbs Miss Philomel\u2019s rest. Can I tell them to leave your meal at the door?\u201d\u201cYes. Thank you.\u201d\u201cRest well then.\u201dThe quick-witted Countess quickly withdrew.Countess is a very nice person. She always cares about Philomel and takes care of her.\u2018But\u2026 \u2018The Countess was still among the people Philomel did not want to reveal her true self.It wasn\u2019t that she was dissatisfied or didn\u2019t trust her. It was just that Philomel couldn\u2019t be completely honest with her.Be kind to everyone, but don\u2019t open your heart to any.That was Philomel\u2019s way of living up until now.\u201c\u2026 am I truly able to change?\u201dPhilomel let out a small sigh.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I have to quickly go out and see as much as I can from the outside world.\u201dPhilomel slapped her cheeks and opened the terrace door.\u201cLe Guin! Jeremiah! Can you hear me? Are you still sleeping?\u201dNot knowing where they might have spent the night, Philomel shouted out loud.The answer came back almost immediately.\u201cI\u2019m awake.\u201dJeremiah, with a cat on his bird-nest like hair, descended from a nearby tree.\u201cYou two seem to be getting along better than I thought.\u201dPhilomel let out an amused laugh at Jeremiah\u2019s appearance. He looked somewhat cute, in her opinion. Jeremiah shook his head.\u201cDon\u2019t say that even as a joke. He said he didn\u2019t want me to look down on him and climbed up on his own.\u201d\u201cDid you sleep on the tree?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s annoying to walk around, and I couldn\u2019t find a free room. But it\u2019s okay. this person and I have slept in the wilderness before, so no big deal.\u201d\u201cMww.\u201dAs if agreeing, the cat let out a cry.\u201cSo, what is it that you wanted to tell me? I hope you can wrap it up quickly.\u201dJeremiah asked as he approached Philomel. His attitude towards Philomel was much better than when they first met, but it was still a feisty one.\u2018Hmm. The cookies I gave you yesterday aren\u2019t enough, huh?\u201dIt seems that Philomel still has to fill his stomach with lots of sweets to leave a good impression on him.\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll show it to you instead!\u201d\u201cShow?\u201d\u201cYes, will you please come with me?\u201dIt was time to put the plan Philomel had in mind since yesterday into action.\u201cTo where?\u201d\u201cTo the Central Plaza, it is the busiest street in the empire. Have you ever been there?\u201d\u2018The Central Plaza is a place that Jeremiah, who hates overpopulated places, has never been to. It\u2019s a place I won\u2019t be going to anytime in the future either.\u2019\u201cNo, I don\u2019t like it.\u201dOnce again his answer came immediately.But Philomel had her reasons to take him there.\u201cOh, it\u2019s gonna be fun because there are so many things to see. It\u2019s not a famous tourist destination for no reason.\u201d\u201cNo. We can talk here as much as you want.\u201d\u201cIf you go there with me, I\u2019ll buy you something sweet and delicious.\u201d\u201c\u2026well, I don\u2019t like sweets! I was just hungry yesterday.\u201dAn obvious lie.\u201cActually, seeing the Central Plaza was one of my dreams, since I\u2019ve never been able to go while living as an imperial Princess\u2026 So can we please go?\u201dJeremiah\u2019s mouth wriggled as Philomel tried to look as pitiful as possible.\u201cJust go with me, you don\u2019t need him.\u201dLe Guin, who transformed back into a human, pitched in, but Philomel ignored him.\u201cI would be really happy if Jeremiah went with me\u2026\u201d\u201cOkay! I\u2019ll go! I\u2019ll go!\u201dEventually, Jeremiah raised the white flag.\u201cPhil, hold my hand while we are going. I\u2019ll teleport us to the Plaza in a heartbeat.\u201dPhilomel looked at Le Guin, who held his hand out for her, with a questioning face.\u201cWhat are you doing? Le Guin should stay here.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want anyone to find out that I\u2019m gone.\u201dIf she were caught, there would be a huge commotion.However, it was cumbersome to go through formal procedures and go out.\u201cPlease. Would you Please keep an eye here. If anything happens, please trick everyone. You can do that with magic, right?\u201dPhilomel exclaimed with a grin.* * *Le Guin, who could not refuse Philomel\u2019s request, took Philomel and Jeremiah to a back alley near the Plaza via teleportation magic.He crossed the magic suppression barrier of the Imperial Palace without even blinking. Judging from the fact that the alarm didn\u2019t go off, he doesn\u2019t seem to be affected by the detection spell either.\u2018To think that the Palace security could be breached this easily, it would be better to call the person in charge and instruct them to patch the barrier up properly-.\u2019Philomel, who habitually thought like a Princess, shook her head.How to improve security? She would only make it more difficult for herself to sneak in and out of the Imperial Palace.\u201cI\u2019m more familiar with the Plaza, so I\u2019m confident I can do better than Jeremiah,\u201dLe Guin grumbled loudly, while leaning against a lamppost.\u201cBut what can I do? Phil told me to go back.\u2018You\u2019re so childish!\u2019Philomel was speechless at the childishness of her biological father.It seems that the only criteria needed to be appointed as the master of the Mage Tower is good magic skills. They do not consider sincerity or maturity.\u2018\u2026 hm, but maybe it was too much to ask the master of the Mage Tower to stay behind and look after my room?\u2019Belated worries crossed Philomel\u2019s mind.But right now, Le Guin\u2019s existence is a hindrance to the quality time she wants to spend with Jeremiah. She was sure if she took them both, her time would be spent just with the father and son arguing the whole time. And Philomel won\u2019t be able to achieve her goal today at all.However, if Le Guin got angry and left his daughter to go back to the Mage Tower, it would get difficult for Philomel to stay in the Imperial Palace.The Emperor said he would treat Philomel as a state guest, but it was unclear whether others would treat her the same way.If things suddenly went according to the development of <Princess Ellencia>, Le Guin\u2019s help was essential to her.Although he gave up in the end, Le Guin was the only one who protected \u2018Philomel\u2019 in <Princess Ellensia>.And\u2026\u2018I\u2019m afraid of Ellencia.\u2019To save Catherine, Ellencia\u2019s words and actions in front of Eustis were contrary.\u201cI love her! I know my dad hates my mom, but she\u2019s more like a mother to me than the mother who gave birth to me.\u201dDid Ellencia really try to save Catherine? Maybe she rather wanted to get her killed.In the conversation she had with Philomel just before running towards Eustis, Ellensia was visibly taken aback after hearing Catherine\u2019s words.Catherine felt that Ellensia had changed into a different person. What if Ellencia deliberately tried to anger his Majesty with those words in order to get rid of Catherine\u2026?Philomel\u2019s shoulders trembled slightly at the heavy, shady malice.It may be a rather far-fetched thought, but it wasn\u2019t an unreasonable doubt either. And if Ellencia\u2019s malice was directed at Philomel at some point, there was no suitable solution.Ellencia was a princess who would one day take over the throne, in case she turned against Philomel, she\u2019d be helpless without Le Guin\u2019s support.\u2018I need to ease Le Guin\u2019s mood.\u2019In an emergency situation, he was the most reliable shield.Philomel spoke to Le Guin with a sociable smile.\u201cAh, don\u2019t be like that, relax. Le Guin can come out to sightsee with me later.\u201d\u201c\u2026 when?\u201d\u201cWell, when we both have time? I\u2019ll give you a special tour of the capital then.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u2018It seems a bit tempting, but let\u2019s also add a little lie.\u2019Philomel lowered her voice, so Jeremiah wouldn\u2019t be able to hear her.\u201cActually, I came out this time to do a sort of rehearsal with Jeremiah. .\u201d\u201cRehearsal?\u201d\u201cYes, I want to get a better look around and discover the good places so I can take Le Guin there directly next time.\u201d\u201c\u2026 really?\u201dHe thought about it as if he didn\u2019t understand.\u2018It is a ridiculous excuse after all\u2026\u2019However, a clear conclusion soon emerged.\u201cThen\u2026 It means that I have more priority than Jeremiah!\u201dIt was an attitude that had no doubts at the ridiculous excuse Philomel\u2019s came up with, like a clear sky.Philomel realized at that moment.\u2018This person is simpler than I thought.\u2019She added flattering words to cheer him up.\u201cOf course, Le Guin has priority. Le Guin is the master of the Mage Tower, is skilled in magic, and passes through the barriers of the Imperial Palace, and uh, um\u2026 his magic is very\u2026\u201dGradually, the reasons why Le Guin was better than Jeremiah disappeared. No, if you looked carefully, that\u2019s all. In the end, it was only that his magic skills were better than Jeremiah\u2019s.What else was there? His appearance? But he looks just like Jeremiah.However, Le Guin\u2019s expression brightened, it seemed that he didn\u2019t care that much about the rest.\u201cYes, that\u2019s what it was. As expected.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s what it is.\u201d\u2018I don\u2019t know what that is, but I roughly agreed.\u2019After that, Le Guin kindly left after leaving the words to call him through the communication device if she wanted to return to the imperial palace.Philomel let out a sigh while holding her chest.That\u2019s a relief. He\u2019s as simple as he\u2019s childish and easy to handle.Taking a breather, she approached Jeremiah, who was far away.Jeremiah didn\u2019t even want to be in the same place as his father, so as soon as they teleported to the back alley, he went a block away by himself.\u201cThe Palace is not a place that I want to stay at for long because I can\u2019t use magic.\u201dJeremiah murmured as he played with a magic formation on his fingertips.Unlike his brothers, who became court Mages and were exempted from the magic suppression barrier, he was unable to exert himself within the imperial palace.In <Princess Ellencia>, he becomes a court wizard. To protect Elencia at all times.For the sake of a woman who considered him just a friend, he killed his character of seeking isolation and joined an organization.Perhaps because she sympathized with his unrequited love, Philomel somehow became attached to Jeremiah while reading the book.Although he was a character who regarded \u2018Philomel\u2019 in the book as an eyesore, it was understandable because \u2018Philomel\u2019 committed so many sins.To him who hovered around Ellencia, \u2018Philomel\u2019, who was the princess\u2019s handmaid, tried to quarrel with him about everything.The relationship between \u2018Philomel\u2019 and Jeremiah was really bitter.\u2018Would have anything changed if they knew that they were siblings by blood?\u2019Jeremiah leaves far away due to the scars of a broken heart before \u2018Philomel\u2019 commits herself to the magic tower.\u2018Philomel\u2019 might have later learned that Jeremiah was her brother while living in the Mage Tower\u2026As soon as Jeremiah left Ellencia, the weight of \u2018Philomel\u2019 also evaporated, so there is no way to know the details.The only thing I knew about \u2018Philomel\u2019s\u2019 next activities was to be caught between the Mage Tower and the Empire, and later she was dragged to the execution table.\u2018Anyway, to avoid the worst ending and find the truth about the book, what I have to do now has been decided.\u2019Looking at Jeremiah\u2019s back, Philomel braced herself.\u201cI\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re on my side!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

About how Jeremiah first feels a crush on Ellencia and how he falls in love.\u2018What would happen if I let him go through that beforehand?\u2019He may not have deep feelings for Philomel, not for Ellencia either right now, but he will definitely build up feelings for Philomel. She gave him a cookie yesterday and his attitude hadn\u2019t gotten any worse.Philomel rummaged through the plans in her head and pulled something out of her bag. And she called Jeremiah after she was ready to go out to the square.\u201cJeremiah, shall we go now?\u201d\u201cUh, yes\u2026 you! What is that!\u201dJeremiah turned to Philomel and shouted in surprise.\u201cYes? What?\u201d\u201cThat thing on your face.\u201d\u201cAh, it\u2019s a mask to hide my identity. As you know, everyone knows my face by now.\u201d\u2018So I armed myself with the hood and mask I brought beforehand.\u2019Philomel was confident that no one would notice her, even if she wandered around in the middle of the plaza.But Jeremiah made an impression as if he didn\u2019t like Philomel\u2019s appearance at all.\u201cTake it off.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou look more suspicious with that.\u201d\u201c\u2026. Do I look very suspicious?\u201d\u201cVery, very, very.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure everyone knows that the mask is for blocking the sunlight.\u201d\u201cIt would be fortunate if you didn\u2019t get a puck or an involuntary check because of that suspicious mask.\u201dPhilomel weakly touched the mask.\u2018Is it that strange? I heard that all the young ladies of the capital who care about their skin always wear this kind of mask these days\u2026\u2019That was the case in a magazine front page specializing in romance novels that Nancy had lent her.\u201cBut since it\u2019s a third-rate magazine, it\u2019s generally unreliable!\u201dCome to think of it, Nancy added this to me when lending me the book.The news viewed by the common people would often make a fuss about false or exaggerated information about the lives of the aristocracy. It is to write anything in the interest of people who yearn for high-class life.\u2018I thought masks were in fashion again, and just the young ladies didn\u2019t tell me\u2026\u2019Most of the noble ladies were friendly towards Philomel, but there was always this invisible wall separating them and Philomel the Imperial Princess. So it was difficult for Philomel to make genuine friendships.When Philomel was sullen, Jeremiah scratched the back of his head and came closer.\u201cIt\u2019s true that it looks suspicious, I can\u2019t help it.\u201dHe took a necklace out of his pocket and put it around Philomel\u2019s neck. Then he took off her mask and led her down the street.\u201cIt\u2019s okay now, no one will notice your presence anymore.\u201dJust as Jeremiah said, no one passing by the Plaza paid Philomel a glance.Instead it was Jeremiah who caught the attention of the women nearby. They whispered, blushed, and came this way.\u201cSheesh, this is why I don\u2019t like crowded places. Let\u2019s go quickly.\u201dJeremiah pulled his hood further down and grabbed Philomele\u2019s wrist to lead her.Philomel fumbled with the necklace around her neck.On the surface, she could see a silver locket necklace embossed with the shape of the mask.She already knew about this necklace through <Princess Ellencia>.It was a necklace always worn by Jeremiah, who wanted to avoid people\u2019s attention.\u201cYour face looks different to others while wearing it.\u201dJeremiah explained why he was bothered by Philomel fiddling with the necklace.He went in front of the store windows and pointed his finger at their reflection on the windows.\u201cWow\u2026\u201dA strange girl dressed as Philomel was reflected in the window. Not only her appearance, but also her hair color and eye color were all different.Philomel, who was slowly examining the window, caught the eye of a profile face resembling an ice statue that had been painstakingly carved by a craftsman.His voluminous silver eyelashes, reminiscent of snowflakes, fluttered every time he closed and opened his eyes.\u2018I can understand why he was nicknamed the Prince of Ice. Beauty must have a lot of hardships.\u2019No wonder that he would carry an item like this.As Jeremiah slowed down in the central square, Philomel spoke to his back.\u201cThank you for the necklace.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m lending it to you.\u201d\u201cThank you, either way. I know it\u2019s an important item for Jeremiah.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dIt\u2019s nothing. It is listed as a national treasure-level item in <Princess Ellencia>.Philomel pouted, invisible to Jeremiah.\u201cIt was rolling around in Le Guin\u2019s room, so I just picked it up and brought it with me.\u201dIs it really no big deal to these people\u2026?In any case, it was a good sign that he lent Philomel an item he always carries around.\u2018It won\u2019t be that hard to get a good impression at this level.\u2019Philomel thought with a grin.Jeremiah then asked, looking around the crowded plaza.\u201cSo, where are you going? It\u2019s too loud to talk here.\u201dConsistent with its nickname of being the heart of the capital, the Central Plaza was overflowing with countless crowds.Seeing Jeremiah frown already, Philomel quickly took the lead.\u201cI know a good place, so I\u2019m going there. Now, trust me and follow me!\u201d\u201cHey, wait for me!\u201dAs Philomel made her way through passers-by like a squirrel, Jeremiah followed. Fortunately, the structure of the plaza was not complicated, so Philomel was able to find her way by recalling the map provided in the magazine Nancy had lent her.After a while, Philomel was standing in awe in front of a building with a pink exterior.An extravagant signboard with the words <Cresion Bakery> flashed exceptionally.\u201cUnbelievable\u2026 \u201cBut how far is the long line of people from the entrance?It stretched out. Everyone wanted to enter the Cresion Bakery.\u201cToo many people \u201c\u201cRight.\u201dJeremiah answered with a frown on one side.\u201cWhen can I get in if I get in line now?\u201d\u201cWell.\u201dThe question was quickly resolved.[Three hours from here]It was because the clerk holding a sign with that written on it was standing at the end of the line.Philomel clasped her forehead.Three hours was too long.If you\u2019re patient, you should be able to get inside the store before it\u2019s time to go back.But the important thing was Jeremiah, not the snacks.Snacks are just offerings to break down the walls of his heart and bring about a harmonious conversation.But you want Jeremiah to line up at a place like this just\u00a0 to feed him some snacks? Jeremiah, who hates people, in a densely populated place?\u2018I never thought there\u2019d be so many people.\u2019This bakery was created when the ancestors of Count Cresion sponsored a young and talented patissier.[Delicious snacks for those who desperately want them.]This was the founding philosophy of Cresion Bakery.According to its founding philosophy, Cresion Bakery served cookies only to customers who had made reservations long ago or who had lined up.They didn\u2019t even pay attention when a respectable aristocrat came with money and demanded that they sell the snacks separately.But exceptions are everywhere.They did not dare to tell the emperor to wait, so Philomel could always eat freshly made hot cookies from Cression whenever she wanted.\u2018I knew the line would be long, but I was optimistic that I would be able to get in if I waited for 20 to 30 minutes.\u2019Jeremiah narrowed his brows and said.\u201cNow that the situation is like this, what can we do? Let\u2019s go somewhere else.\u201d\u201cStill, the snacks here are rumored to be the most delicious in the empire\u2026 \u201c\u201cEven if it\u2019s delicious, it\u2019s just a snack.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because Jeremiah couldn\u2019t eat it. How soft and crispy is the common egg tart made at Cresion\u2026 I really wanted you to taste it.\u201dA dark melancholy overtook Philomel.\u2018Why am I always like this?\u2019The escape plan prepared for 7 years was also caught and ended in just a few days. Philomel\u2019s efforts were futile, as if they were nothing.Come to think of it, since she was young, it seemed that almost nothing went the way she had planned.After struggling to live and not die, she managed to get an evaluation that was about half of the praise Ellencia heard in the book.Maybe wanting to know the truth of the book is also a vain curiosity.A criminal like herself might have to live contented with not worrying about her life anymore. Give up useless adventures for nothing.Jeremiah shouted as Philomel\u2019s expression grew darker.\u201cI don\u2019t care about that either, so\u2026 Why are you?\u201dJust then Jeremiah\u2019s eyes landed on another building.\u201cLet\u2019s go There!\u201dAt Jeremiah\u2019s fingertips, there was a small, shabby shop.Only the peeled-off signboard that read \u201cRainbow Cookie Shop\u201d revealed the identity of the store.The store was so obscure that Philomel wouldn\u2019t have even noticed that it was there if Jeremiah hadn\u2019t pointed it out.It was a great gut to open a store of the same type right across Cresion.\u201cSomehow, I don\u2019t think the sweets there will be delicious. It looks like there are no guests.\u201d\u201cThen it\u2019s rather welcome to me. There must be no one inside.\u201dIndeed. That might be a good place for Jeremiah.Philomel reluctantly decided to give up the taste of sweets from the Cresion bakery.\u2018I just need to do it, well.\u2019If she were to\u00a0 look for it, she\u2019ll find a good pastry shop besides Cresion, but she felt sorry for continuing to drag Jeremiah around.\u201cGreat. I\u2019ll treat you, so eat to your heart\u2019s content.\u201dJeremiah smiled briefly at Philomel, who took out her wallet in her bag and spat it out solemnly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Currently, the only menu available at our restaurant is apple pie.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Do you have anything but apple pie? Any kind of small cookies perhaps?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m really sorry. We have run out of materials.\u201dIndeed, there could not have been enough ingredients in a store that only flies fly. If it doesn\u2019t sell anyway, it will go bad quickly.After reluctantly ordering apple pie, the two sat down at an empty table.\u201cApple pie is enough.\u201dPhilomel smiled lightly at Jeremiah\u2019s consoling tone, but she couldn\u2019t help feeling bitter.Apple pie wasn\u2019t a bad dessert, but it was too ordinary to treat Jeremiah, who was dragged out to the central square.Fortunately, there are no customers in the store, so there is nothing to offend Jeremiah even more\u2026\u201cThere\u2019s not too much without it.\u201dThe only guests were Philomel and Jeremiah.Suddenly, Philomel was afraid of the taste of apple pie.\u2018Please, it should be delicious. Otherwise, Jeremiah\u2019s good feelings will be over forever!\u2019Philomel closed her eyes tightly and cried out earnestly inwardly.Soon after, the sweet smell of apples tickled the tip of her nose.\u201cThe apple pie you ordered is here!\u201dLooking at the grilled lattice-shaped pie, Philomel swallowed. Come to think of it, it was such a popular dessert but she, as a princess, had very few memories of eating it.\u201cLet\u2019s try it.\u201dPhilomel cut the pie beautifully and put a piece on Jeremiah\u2019s plate, and then one on her plate as well.\u201cI can do it with my own hands.\u201dIn an overly sweet scentJeremiah hesitantly lifted the fork but put it down without tasting the pie.\u2018Apple pie isn\u2019t too sweet. I\u2019ll have to try it first and let you know how it tastes.\u2019The moment Philomel hurriedly took a bite of the apple pie, her golden eyes widened in surprise.\u2018It tastes better than I expected!\u2019First of all, the texture of the crunchy apple was excellent. It seemed like they used fresh fruit. If you don\u2019t care, the taste is so sweet that your tongue hurts, and if you eat it with black tea, it goes well together.\u201cIt\u2019s good to eat. Jeremiah, you should try it too!\u201d\u201cOkay?\u201dThat was when Jeremiah stretched out his hand toward the pie with a look of hope.But suddenly, a loud rumbling sound resounded through the quiet room.The shabby door was thrown open roughly enough to break open, and the three men entered.\u201cHey! When are you going to pay the rent?\u201d I know how much it\u2019s been pushed back so far!\u201dA man with a stern look in the lead shouted.Then the owner of the bakery who served Philomel and Jeremiah the pie earlier shivered and answered.\u201cI\u2019m sorry! Could you give me a little more time? The money is not ready yet\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen will that bastard get his money! You know it\u2019s no fun if you keep doing things like this, right?\u201dClank!Then the man kicked the cabinet next to him resulting in the tableware falling to the floor and breaking.\u201cOh! Please stop it! Please stop it!\u201dThe owner wailed, but the kicking did not stop. The men\u2019s group just watched and giggled.\u201cHe let you operate in an unauthorized building and this is how you pay his grace back!\u201dPhilomel roughly grasped the situation from the little information that their conversation provided.They were thugs collecting rent from the surrounding merchants. It seemed that this shop had been doing things without permission, taking advantage of the fact that it was an unauthorized building.\u2018If it\u2019s an unauthorized building, it can\u2019t be protected by the government.\u2019The owner, unable to watch his furniture get destroyed further, grabbed the man\u2019s legs and hung on.\u201cPlease! If you destroy all of this, how are we going to do business?\u201d\u201cWhat a pain! Let go of me!\u201dWhen the man\u2019s kick was directed at the elderly owner, Philomel unconsciously tried to stand up.\u201cStop.\u201dHowever, Jeremiah dissuaded her with a cool attitude.\u201cBut\u2026!\u201d\u201cWhat can you even do in this situation?\u201d\u201cEven if it is an unauthorized building, private place rent collection and violence are serious crimes. If you report it to the authorities\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s strange that this building operates at all? Of course the government officials know about it, they are in on this.\u201dHe\u2019s right. Usually, the tyranny of the gangsters in the neighborhood takes place under the connivance of the officials. Philomel knows it, she knows, but still.Jeremiah continued, slowly mashing his pie with a fork.\u201cIt\u2019s not like you can do anything about them right now, and it\u2019s best not to interfere in other people\u2019s affairs. Even if you saved the host this time, do you think they won\u2019t come back here again?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s something that will happen someday, anyway. If you can\u2019t take responsibility until the end, don\u2019t intervene.\u201dPhilomel bit her lip, not saying anything.His comments were overly cynical but pointed right to the problem.There was nothing that Philomel, who was neither a princess anymore nor held any title, could do. Even if she mentioned the law, they wouldn\u2019t listen, and it would be considered fortunate if she got out unharmed.Crucially, Philomel wasn\u2019t even kind enough to help others without any countermeasures.But is it really meaningless to help others just because, as he said, you can\u2019t take full responsibility?Philomel said weakly, for some reason wanting to refute.\u201c\u2026 Jeremiah also helped me when I was about to be pickpocketed.\u201d\u201cIt just cleaned up the trash that fell in front of my house.\u201dJeremiah poked a piece of pie with a fork.\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m not in the mood for a conversation. Let\u2019s eat quickly and leave.\u201dAn anticipation that could not be hidden was seen in his sky-blue eyes. The pie looked delicious to his eyes, too.It was then.Plash!A shoe flew out of nowhere and landed on Jeremiah\u2019s plate.\u201cOh, my.\u201dThe apple pie was smashed under a dirty shoe.Philomel looked in the direction where the shoe came flying and saw that only one foot of the man who was assaulting the owner had no shoes. The shoe appeared to have come off while kicking the owner.One of the man\u2019s companions came up to Jeremiah and leaned a hand on his shoulder.\u201cI\u2019m sorry about this. He avoided him because he didn\u2019t want to get hit\u2026 Oh, my God, you can\u2019t eat the pie! But you know you can\u2019t get a refund, right? Because the money here is ours.\u201dThe fork in Jeremiah\u2019s hand bent with a groan.\u201c\u2026You want to die.\u201d\u201cHuh! Who the fuck do you think you\u2019re talking to-?\u201dBang!The man was unable to finish his speech because Jeremiah threw him against the opposite wall.After that, it was a breeze.\u201cYou, you bastard! What are you doing? Who do you think we are working for\u2026?Jeremiah also dealt with the man who hit the owner as fast as the wind. It was a feat accomplished not by magic, but by Jeremiah\u2019s fists and kicks.In particular, the flying kick movement was artistic beyond being superfluous and clean.\u201c\u2026 How dare you do this? Do know who we are, man!\u201dJeremiah, who easily dealt with the remaining one, dusted off his clothes.\u201cPhilomel, are you hurt anywhere?\u201dPhilomel answered as she came out from under the table.\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201dWhen the pie was ruined and Jeremiah\u2019s eyes were dyed red, she had already fled under the table.Philomel smiled slightly as she looked at the chaos in the room.\u201cWhat was that, Jeremiah? You told me not to interfere.\u201d\u201c\u2026 that was a personal revenge.\u201d\u201cAll right. Let\u2019s count it that way.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not intervening\u2026\u201dAt that time, the last man who had fallen staggered to his feet.He was a man with a nervous appearance and a small physique.\u201cAssaulting a good citizen! I will report you!\u201dJeremiah sneered.\u201cIn the Empire, it seems that those who act violently in stores are called good citizens.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a violent act! As we said, they are operating illegally in an unauthorized building, so we were just giving proper guidance. Go to the government office and ask!\u201d\u201cYou must have not been hit enough.\u201d\u201cHee-ik!\u201dPhilomel stopped Jeremiah from approaching the man.\u201cWait a minute.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI have something to say.\u201dJeremiah crumpled his face at Philomel\u2019s words, but took a step back.She sat down on the floor and stared at the man, who trembled and pursed her lips.Before philomel could say anything the man started to blabber.\u201cOoh, we were just following the law. If you look at Article 34, Paragraph 3 of the Imperial Commercial Code, unauthorized buildings\u2026\u201dUnlike the other two, who just used their pure strength, this one seemed to use his brains more.Philomel quietly agreed.\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. Certainly, Article 34, Paragraph 3 of the Commercial Act states that it is illegal to operate in an unauthorized building.\u201d\u201cYeah, yes! Knowing that and knowingly doing this\u2026!\u201d\u201cBut there are always exceptions.\u201dPhilomel\u2019s small but determined voice echoed quietly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It is a way to protect the legitimate rights of those who have lived there for ten years.\u201dThe man opened his mouth.Philomel asked the owner.\u201cNo matter how you look at it, it looks like this building has been built for well over ten years, isn\u2019t that correct?\u201dThe owner nodded several times.\u201cHave there been any dispositions from the government office in the meantime? The demolition was not carried out, even though it seemed a pretense\u2026 Did you receive a notice to vacate?\u201d\u201cAs far as I know, there is none! This building was built by my grandfather, but I haven\u2019t heard anything from either my grandfather or my father.\u201d\u201cThen it\u2019s safe to say that permission was granted earlier.\u201d\u201cIs that true?\u201d\u201cOf course. As long as you pass the safety inspection, there shouldn\u2019t be any problem.\u201dHearing this the man on the floor screamed loudly.\u201cNonsense! Where in the world is there a law like that? I will go to the government office and tell them all! They\u2019ll take that bastard\u2019s safety inspection or whatever and then he\u2019ll be operating in an unauthorized building.\u201d\u201cDo as you please.\u201dPhilomele scoffed.\u201cBut if the safety inspection results are in favor of a demolition, the government office will be in trouble. You mean you\u2019ve left a dangerous building that could collapse at any moment for over ten years, is that it?\u201dThe official in charge must have been aware of the existence of this building but neglected it. It was more beneficial to collude with these people and extort money from the owner.They took advantage of the fact that most people, except for some intellectuals, are ignorant of the law.\u201cI\u2019m going to officially complain to my superiors, so we\u2019ll see.\u201d\u201cNo, do you really think high-ranking people will listen to you?\u201dPhilomel couldn\u2019t exactly say that the highest ranking person the Emperor in this country would listen, so she put Jeremiah forward.\u201cWhose son is he?\u201dAs expected, the title of a nobleman was not given for nothing to the second male lead. Jeremiah looked like a young noble from an aristocratic family who deliberately wore shabby clothes.\u201cI, I\u2026\u201dThe man struggled to see if he wanted to respond, but eventually lowered his head.So they kicked all the men out of the store.The owner cried and bowed his head to Philomel and Jeremiah.\u201cThank you! Thank you so much!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I haven\u2019t done much.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know how to repay you\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really fine\u201dPhilomel waved her hand with a puzzled expression.\u201cNo. Please let me know if you need anything. If it wasn\u2019t for you two, I would have been threatened by them all my life.\u201dThe owner spoke with a sharp eye that made it hard to refuse.\u201cWell, in that case\u2026\u201dPhilomel glanced at Jeremiah and opened her mouth.Thirty minutes later.A new apple pie arrived at the table where Philomel and Jeremiah were sitting.The owner was worried that this Pie allone wouldn\u2019t be enough, but it was enough and overflowing. Jeremiah opened his mouth while slicing a new apple pie.\u201cAnyway, you seem very well versed in the law.\u201d\u201cYeah, after studying this and that in the Palace I memorized a few.\u201cOf course, the education of the successor also included the study of the law.Although she did not learn all the laws of the empire, she was familiar with the laws that had a profound impact on the lives of the people. Among them, Article 34 of the Commercial Act was familiar because there were many related legal disputes.\u201cRather than that, try eating the apple pie. It\u2019s very delicious.\u201d\u201cSince you insist that the pie is delicious, let\u2019s see how delicious it really is\u2026\u201dFinally, Jeremiah put the piece of pie into his mouth.In an instant, his eyes shimmered like glass beads.\u201c\u2026it\u2019s not to the point where I can\u2019t eat it.\u201dAlthough he praised the pie to be just edible, yet he kept shoving pieces of pie into his mouth. Unlike Philomel, he didn\u2019t drink black tea.\u201cWhat are you laughing at?\u201d\u201cMe? I didn\u2019t laugh.\u201d\u201cYou laughed.\u201dPhilomel quickly changed the subject before Jeremiah got angry.\u201cBy the way, Jeremiah, you fought really well when I saw you earlier. I also noticed you wear a sword around your waist, are you perhaps both, a swordsman and a mage?\u201cPhilomel pretended to have no clue, even though Jeremiah\u2019s abilities were clearly described in <Princess Ellencia>.\u00a0 So rather than genuine curiosity, she used her knowledge as a groundwork to start a conversation.Jeremiah, unaware of Philomel\u2019s intentions, answered sincerely.\u201cExactly, I\u2019m a swordmage.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re a swordmage, then you\u2019re someone who can use magic and wield a sword, right?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019ve always been interested in swordsmanship since I was a kid. And there were several swordmage in the Mage Tower.\u201d\u201cThen, are Le Guin, Lexion, and Cardin also masters of magic swordsmanship?Philomel was genuinely curious about this.Unlike Jeremiah, there wasn\u2019t much information about the other three in the book.Le Guin\u2019s face was only briefly described, and Philomel\u2019s two other brothers did not even appear.\u201cCardin is also a swordmage. Lexion has no interest in swords\u2026 and I\u2019ve never seen Le Guin handle a sword.\u201dJeremiah briefed philomel, shoving a piece of pie into his mouth.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit embarrassing to say in front of Jeremiah, but I thought all of the mages only used spells and such.\u201d\u201cDid you think we are all that worthless?\u201d\u201cNo it\u2019s because I\u2019ve never met a mage who is also a swordsman\u2026\u201cIt was true.Most of the court wizards that Philomel knew, including Humphrey, seemed to only use their brains and didn\u2019t train their body at all.\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong. In the wizarding world, people who train their bodies are treated as a different kind\u2026\u201dHe raised his fist.\u201cFists are quicker and easier than magic. This is also one of Le Guin\u2019s principles.\u201dIt\u2019s a brutal yet practical principle.The rest of the conversation between the two continued in a similar way. Philomel asked questions and Jeremiah satisfied her curiosity.Time passed by on conversations about miscellaneous yet everyday topics.After emptying the plate containing the apple pie, the two left the Rainbow Bakery.\u201cGoodbye!\u201dThe owner followed them to the door and bid his goodbyes.Philomel looked sadly at the shabby exterior of the store.\u201cThe apple pie is really good, but it\u2019s a pity there are no customers.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s such a flashy store across the street, so who\u2019s going to go over there?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201dInstead, Philomel decided that she should come to the store often so that it wouldn\u2019t collapse. Even though she didn\u2019t know how long it\u2019ll take to come back here again.Afterward, Philomel and Jeremiah walked together around the Central Plaza.Originally, the purpose of their outing was to show Jeremiah around, but Philomel also fell in love with various attractions before she knew it.When Philomel went out in stealth in the past, her escorts were constantly by her side, so she couldn\u2019t freely look around to her heart\u2019s content.After running away, Philomel saw people live freely for the first time in Saint Gen, the largest city in the north, and yet the streets of Saint Gen aren\u2019t comparable to the capital\u2019s Central Plaza.Philomel\u2019s eyes lit up as she watched the man control the snake with his flute.\u201cWow, look at that! Do snakes recognize the sound of flutes? How does he do that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just magic. Take a good look. The magic circle drawn on the flute.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Jeremiah breaks people\u2019s fantasies.\u201d\u201cHmph, you complain even though you asked.\u201c\u201cI\u2019m kidding. Thank you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s been a while. Let\u2019s go get something to eat.\u201dEmbarrassed, Jeremiah turned around and moved away.Since they had already filled her stomach with apple pie, they simply ate street food for lunch.Philomel, who was sitting on a bench and eating sausages on a paper plate, felt Jeremiah\u2019s gaze.\u201c\u2026 Is there something on my face?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cBut why are you looking at me like that\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fascinating.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cEven though you\u2019ve lived as the precious princess, you aren\u2019t a picky eater. Besides, you said that it\u2019s a wish that\u2019s not like a poem, such as visiting the Plaza.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like a poem. It\u2019s not just a Plaza tour.\u201d\u201cThen what?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s meaningful because it\u2019s a tour with Jeremiah.\u201dJeremiah was silent for a long time before answering.\u201cYou say embarrassing things so easily.\u201dis it? It was only an embarrassing thing to say, but Philomel said it without thinking. In fact, her visit to the Plaza was a behind-the-scenes work to make Jeremiah on her side.After eating, they continued walking on the main road again, but Jeremiah suddenly stopped.\u201cWait, in the end, we only talked about useless things and looked around. So what the hell did you want to tell me?\u201dOh, no. he noticed.Philomel shouted, pointing away as if she hadn\u2019t heard Jeremiah\u2019s voice.\u201cAh! It\u2019s an open-air theater over there! It looks like they\u2019re putting on a play, so let\u2019s go and watch it!\u201d\u201cHey! Slow down!\u201dAnd she ran toward the theater to keep him from speaking.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 55": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/There Is No Place For FakesCH 55Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs she settled down on the circular stone steps, Jeremiah reluctantly sat beside her.The play was in full swing, so both of them watched the play in silence.While watching the play, Philomel had other thoughts in the back of her mind.\u2018It\u2019s not the time yet. Let\u2019s wait for the time when Jeremiah can open up some more.\u2019Up until this point, it was quite similar to the development in the book.Ellencia, a country girl, meets the Mage Jeremiah in the forest one day.At the time, Jeremiah had left the Magic Tower and was traveling the world.Jeremiah rescues Ellencia, who is in danger after encountering a wolf in the forest, and Ellencia gives him a tour of the market in return.It was the largest market among the fairs held near the village where Ellencia lived.Jeremiah was reluctant, but because he had something he needed right away, he accompanied her and felt a different kind of pleasure there.It was the first time he had ever experienced a market because he hated crowded places.Suddenly, he opens the door of his heart to Ellencia and unwittingly reveals his dark side.And crucially, it\u2019s something that Ellencia said, which helped Jeremiah to open his heart.\u2018I am going to say those words first. Then wouldn\u2019t that naturally create a family affection or something similar?\u2019Even if affection isn\u2019t formed, Jeremiah has\u00a0 to hear the words Ellencia said in <Princess Ellencia>, from Philomel in advance.The first time you go through any experience is the most memorable. The second time not as much.Philomel looked at Jeremiah with a tense face. He was ignorant of his surroundings and was absorbed in the theater.Then a booming voice hit Philomel\u2019s eardrums.\u201cOh, dear! Why don\u2019t you love me? I die in sorrow today again because of your indifference.\u201dAn actress was crying out on stage. Only then did Philomel focus on the content of the play.The play performed in the amphitheater was a tragic love story that was nothing special. Two lovers fall in love normally but are separated due to opposition from their families, slander from those around them, and trivial misunderstandings.\u2018Did they say it\u2019s a huge fad in the capital recently?\u2019Although she had never seen it herself, Philomel knew roughly the plot after hearing about it from the maids.It was the man who left first, but he later realized the misunderstanding and regretet it, while the woman grieves and finds new love.Perhaps it was still in the early stages, it was a scene where a woman clings to her lover who is about to leave.\u2018Somehow, it\u2019s kind of hard to see.\u2019She knew that later the situation would be reversed, but this scene, a woman clinging to man, reminded her of something.\u2018Catherine and \u2018Philomel\u2019 in the book were like that too.\u2019Philomel couldn\u2019t comprehend why \u2018Philomel\u2019 in the book and Catherine were respectively so obsessed with Nassar and Eustis.\u2018I\u2019m determined not to do so,\u2019Philomel glanced toward Jeremiah, but somehow he looked gloomy.\u2018Oh, is it that boring? But considering that, he\u2019s still watching the play quite diligently.\u2019But suddenly, a memory flashed through her mind.It was regarding what Jeremiah had said about his mother in the book.\u201cMy mother thought that my father would love her once she gave birth to a child, but my father is an impossible human being.\u201dA long time after their first meeting, Jeremiah confided that story only to Ellencia as a side note.\u201cMother was devastated. She found out too late that her wish could never come true. She left, and abandoned the man she loved and the child who resembled him.\u201dJust as Philomel thought of Catherine and \u2018Philomel\u2019 in the book while watching the play, Jeremiah seemed to think of his mother.Putting together the contents of the book and the facts she knew, Jeremiah\u2019s mother loved Le Guin.Because of this, she participated in the experiment and even gave birth to a child, but in the end, it seemed that she left when she couldn\u2019t win Le Guin\u2019s heart.When Philomel didn\u2019t know the exact circumstances, she thought to myself while reading the book, \u201cIt is so nice that he even got married, but his father is too much.\u201dHowever, considering that the two were in a contractual relationship, it was impossible to blame only Le Guin. Philomel only felt sorry for Jeremiah, who was left behind.\u2018The world is complicated, so complicated.\u2019Philomel sighed quietly, then opened her eyes wide in realization.\u2018Wait, isn\u2019t this an opportunity?\u2019\u2018I\u2019m sorry Jeremiah\u2019Philomel has been waiting for him to show his weak side up until now. Only then was it possible for her to \u2018comfort Jeremiah by saying that\u2019 out of courtesy.Perhaps it was a godsend to induce him to see this play by chance.Philomel\u2019s conscience was pricked by the use of others\u2019 wounds, but she could not give up her chance.Anyway, Jeremiah had to stop falling for Ellencia.Fortunately or unfortunately, Jeremiah\u2019s mood was low even after the play had a happy ending.Philomel rose from her seat, brushing the dust from her clothes.\u201cNow, shall we go somewhere else?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes.\u201dJeremiah, lost in thoughts, followed her without much question.\u201cI\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re so down.\u201dHoping to comfort him a bit, Philomel took him to an ice cream shop and handed him a large two-tiered ice cream cone.\u201c\u2026\u201dHowever, when she saw that he was not ready to eat, Philomel also lost her appetite.\u2018I can\u2019t help it. I have no choice but to say that\u2026\u2019Philomel took him with her to find a suitable place.The atmosphere is the most important thing in a conversation. Jeremiah needed a place where he would want to speak his mind.When she reached the river, a natural exclamation broke out of her mouth.\u201cWow, it\u2019s pretty.\u201dBefore Philomel knew it, the sun was already setting. The waters of the Klimer River, called the lifeline of the empire, were dyed in a beautiful red light.\u2018This seems like the right place.\u2019The view of the huge river was magnificent and somewhat lonely.\u201cJeremiah, this way!\u201dLooking at the river with the sunset in the background, he was like a painting. The lonely atmosphere made him look more like a work of art.Philomel approached him and chose what to say.\u2018Would it be better to ask first if he has any concerns first?\u2019Or it\u2019s better to talk about childhood first and naturally induce old stories\u2026But why?I couldn\u2019t keep my mouth shut.\u2019Philomel was taken aback when she saw his face, which looked much more lonely than expected.Just like Ellencia did,\u201cI can see the same loneliness in your eyes.\u201d\u201cI understand your pain. I\u2019ll be your friend.\u201dI have to say these words\u2026At that moment, a sharp question dawned on Philomel.\u2018Do I understand his pain?\u2019Here, even if she doesn\u2019t understand, she has to say that she understands, but for some reason, the words didn\u2019t come out easily.The reality was different from the scenario that Philomel had when she planned.It was too clear. The loneliness of Jeremiah.He was not a character composed only of typefaces, but a living, breathing human being, and his pain was the trace of a person\u2019s past intact.Philomel still thought.\u2018I\u2019m arrogant.\u2019\u2018I thought I understood Jeremiah just because I read that book.\u2019She was confident that she could direct his heart in the direction she wanted.She would have been disgusted if someone else like her had read the book and said that she understands Philomel.\u2018Yes, let\u2019s stop doing this.\u2019Philomel brightened her clouded expression and approached him.\u201cJeremiah!\u201d\u201c\u2026 Why are you doing that, yup!\u201dShe stuffed her ice cream into Jeremiah\u2019s mouth.\u201cEat my ice cream, too! Don\u2019t worry, I will not say anything.\u201d\u201cWhy me?\u201d\u201cEat and cheer up. Why are you so low-spirited?\u201dPhilomel forced him to take the ice cream and walked along the river with a light gait. When Jeremiah saw her back, he was so dumbfounded that he laughed.\u2018I don\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019re thinking.\u2019Then Jeremiah suddenly realized.\u2018Why am I smiling?\u2019The fact that he was excited about doing something untimely today.He became acutely serious.If he was his usual self, he would have been angry, but he was splitting things up about what he liked.\u2018It isn\u2019t like me to follow her beat in the first place.\u2019At first, Le Guin, who was behind him, was obviously annoying, so he only complied with his requirements, but at some point, he stopped thinking about his father.A grump welled up in his heart. It was a kind of reaction and inertia. Wanting to return to their original form.So he spit out the thorny words that had been at the back of his mind for a while.\u201cDon\u2019t be conceited.\u201dPhilomel turned around.\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d\u201cYou seem to misunderstand something.\u201dHe said with a fishy smile.\u201cThe reason Le Guin is at your beck and call right now is not because he has affection for you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHe doesn\u2019t love his children, but he at least has the perception that we are his children. That\u2019s why he\u2019s a little more lenient with us than with others.\u201d\u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d\u201cThere are times when he is generous, mostly to the object of his self-interest. Sometimes it\u2019s an object, animal, or monster, sometimes it\u2019s a human. And you happened to awaken that self-interest in him this time.\u201dPhilomel said nothing.\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m saying, don\u2019t blindly trust the favors he gives you. He is a great person, but he will always turn his back on you if his interest fades. Don\u2019t go expecting that you will be special to him.\u201dWhen she didn\u2019t respond, Jeremiah grew impatient, even saying things he didn\u2019t want to say.\u201cI know a woman like that. A person who hoped and despaired that she would one day become special to him. In case you become like her\u2026\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI understand everything Jeremiah\u2019s trying to say. It\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t say more.\u201dPhilomel smiled feverishly.Jeremiah looked at her without saying a word.\u201cAnd don\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t expect that.\u201dA cool river breeze brushed past them. Brown hair fluttered in the wind.Philomel looked at the other side of the river, which continued endlessly somewhere.\u201cI know very well that I am no big deal to Le Guin or to my three brothers.\u201dJeremiah was stunned.A question crept into his mind, he wondered if he had just made an irreparable mistake.Jeremiah thought so, even though he wasn\u2019t sure what kind of mistake it was.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Jeremiah, you have a very delicate corner.\u2019In an instant, the gazes of Jeremiah and Philomel met.He quickly turned his face away.\u2018Oh, but I think you\u2019re looking at me to see if I\u2019m angry\u2026?\u2019Philomel\u2019s doubts were soon erased by people\u2019s murmurs. Come to think of it, the streets were noisy for some reason.\u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019Philomel took a few steps out of the back alley and looked out onto the boulevard. Many people gathered in front of the bulletin board and were whispering.\u2018It seems like it will take time for Le Guin to arrive, but a little while would be fine, right?\u2019Philomel listened to the conversation of two nearby passers-by.\u201cHey, what\u2019s written on the poster that came down from the palace, so it\u2019s such a mess? Ugh, there are so many people that I can\u2019t even see them.\u201d\u201cThe rumor that a new princess has appeared is true.\u201d\u201cI knew it!\u201d\u201cBut that\u2019s not the point! They say the old princess isn\u2019t a bad person!\u201dThe person who heard that jumped.\u201cWhat is it? Then why was she the princess when she wasn\u2019t really the Emperor\u2019s daughter!\u201d\u201cIt says on the poster that it was accidentally changed when the princess was born, due to the mistakes of the lower ones.\u201d\u201cNo, is that possible?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know! Well, doesn\u2019t it often happen that a child changes at a daycare center? It seems that the circumstances of the high-ranking people are no different from ours.\u201dThere\u2019s all that\u2019s going on.\u201d\u201cYou should watch your mouth, too. They said that if you go around talking about the princess\u2019s past, your tongue will be cut off.\u201d\u201cWho said that?\u201d\u201cThe soldier who was putting up the poster turned out to be a person who really appreciates finding the princess.\u201d\u201cIt was. I knew it for some reason.\u201d\u201cWhen did you? Didn\u2019t you shout that such things should be prematurely killed?\u201d\u201cYekki! You\u2019ll be in big trouble if someone hears you!\u201d But\u2026\u201dThe man stroked his chin with a questionable look.\u201cStrangely, I was furious at that time\u2026 In retrospect, it didn\u2019t have to be.\u201d\u201cI know. I thought that someone who didn\u2019t even read the newspaper was curiously interested.\u201dThen a sound came right behind Philomel.\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\u201cOh my god!\u201dAs Philomel screamed in embarrassment, Jeremiah, who was behind her, scratched his cheek shyly.\u201cSince Le Guin has arrived, let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cWhat about Jeremiah? Aren\u2019t you going?\u201d Are you really leaving the capital city?If that\u2019s the case, there\u2019s something I need to say before that.Philomel urgently looked at him.\u201c\u2026 You go first. I have some things to take care of before I go separately.\u201dLooking down at Philomel, Jeremiah replied.\u201cHow can you enter the palace without Le Guin?\u201d\u201cThere are ways. It takes a bit longer, and it\u2019s bothersome, but no big deal.\u201dLeaving only these words, Jeremiah disappeared towards the square.Philomel joined Le Guin and returned to the Palace.When asked why he came so late, Le Guin replied that Countess Deles kept ordering him around.Finally, Philomel realized that Le Guin had been disguising himself as her to deceive other people all this time.Le Guin claimed to have perfectly played Philomel, but\u2026\u201cMiss, Philomel? Um\u2026did you enjoy the meal?\u201d\u201cIf we did something wrong, please don\u2019t hesitate to tell us.\u201dWhen the countess Deles and her maidservants carefully watched her, it was an untrustworthy statement.\u201cWhat on earth did you do?!\u201dBut it was already spilled water.She promised herself not to give Le Guin this kind of role again.Jeremiah came back in the late evening. His clothes and hair seemed to have burned as if he had jumped into a pit of fire on his way back.He came through the window once again, holding a fancy paper bag in his hands.\u201cI found it on the way here.\u201d\u201c\u2026You found Crescion bakery\u2019s snacks on the way here?The envelope was full of various popular menu items that Crescion bakery boasted about.\u201cAhem! I didn\u2019t see any lines on the way here. I just picked it up on the way without hesitation.\u201dIf you picked it up, you picked it up, and if you bought it, you bought it. It was strange logic.Jeremy looked down at the innocent ground for no reason.\u201cAnyway! I\u2019ll give it to you, so eat it. And\u2026\u201dThe next words were gibberish.\u201cForget what I said during the day. It was nonsense.\u201dPhilemon didn\u2019t quite understand what that meant.\u201cWhat did he say during the day? What was that? Oh, that!\u201dShe\u2019s more delicate than you\u2019d think.Le Guin, who was listening to their conversation, chimed in instead of the hesitant Jeremy.\u201cWhat, what? What did Jeremiah say?\u201dPhilemon answered instead of Jeremiah, who was hemming and hawing.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Instead, why don\u2019t we eat these snacks? They\u2019re delicious!\u201dThe three of them used Le Guin\u2019s magic to move to the Maze Garden and held a midnight snack party in Caneo Peak.\u201cHey, that was the one I was going to steam and eat.\u201d\u201cHmph. The one who grabs it first is the boss.\u201d\u201cStop talking and give it to me.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s where I draw the line with the things I\u2019ve bought.\u201dThe sound of the two rich men bickering served as background noise.As if passing by, Philomel mentioned, \u201cIt would\u2019ve been nice if Lexion and Cadin were here,\u201d and the two men suddenly appeared.Lexion, who had fallen from the magic circle created by Le Guin in the air, grabbed onto his shoulders and stood up.\u201cUgh, I wish you could\u2019ve just called us normally.\u201dCadin, who had fallen asleep, showed no signs of waking up even though he fell from somewhere.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t intend to call you like that\u2026\u201dAs Philomel looked at Le Guin with an accusing gaze, he shrugged.\u201cWell, those two are rough, so it\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cUgh, let\u2019s just talk.In any case, Lexion sat down in his seat. After a while, Cadin, who had woken up with Jeremiah\u2019s foot tapping, joined them.Lexion and Cadin were appointed as court magicians today.The four of them started chatting.\u201cWow! These cookies are really delicious! What\u2019s their name?\u201dCadin exclaimed as he ate the cookies.\u201cJeez, it\u2019s too noisy to eat.\u201dJeremiah grumbled, and Lexion calmly spoke up.\u201cPhil, there was this countess or something who was really bothering me today, pretending to be you.\u201dLe Guin started the conversation.While watching her father and brothers chattering away, Philomel thought to herself. These people really only talk about themselves.\u201cIs there ever a proper conversation between us?\u201dAnyway, they were all people who thought of Philomel in their own way.And when they all gathered together, she had something she wanted to say before Jeremiah left.\u201cEveryone, please listen.\u201dAll the noise stopped and everyone\u2019s attention was focused on Philomel.Philomel cleared her throat and said, \u201cI have something I want to say to all of you. I want to express my gratitude for coming all the way here for me.\u201dShe held the hem of her dress and slightly bowed her body.\u201cI don\u2019t expect any of you to take responsibility for my life.\u201dEveryone who had been listening to Philomel intently until now was suddenly taken aback.\u201cI don\u2019t have any intention of going to Mage Tower even if I finish what I came here to do. Of course, that doesn\u2019t mean that I won\u2019t ever go. If I think of you, I\u2019ll come to visit. As long as you don\u2019t shut me out\u2026\u201d\u201cWait a minute, Phil.\u201dLexion was the first to regain his composure and raised his hand.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re not going to Mage Tower, where are you planning to live? Perhaps in the Imperial Palace?\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it. I haven\u2019t decided on anything specific yet.\u201d\u201cWell, Mage Tower wouldn\u2019t be a bad choice\u2026\u201d\u201cNo. Lexion told me to do what I wanted to do.\u201dPhilomel interrupted Lexion firmly.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve thought about it, but I just don\u2019t feel like going to Mage Tower.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dLe Guin asked with a puzzled expression that was hard to understand.\u201cEven if you became a wizard, wouldn\u2019t you want to go to Mage Tower?\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m not a wizard.\u201d\u201cThen you can become one.\u201dDespite Le Guin\u2019s insistence, Philomel did not waver.\u201cWhy are you like this?!\u201dThe three brothers also kept trying to persuade Philomel.\u201cPhil, think about it again. Mage Tower is a pretty good place.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! It\u2019s a good place\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s not bad.\u201dLexion, Caden, and Jeremiah spoke in turn.\u201cThank you for your thoughts, but I have no intention of going.\u201dBut Philomel was adamant.Of course, there was a slight concern in her heart.\u2018What if I become a criminal and have nowhere to go?\u2019If that happens, she would have to go to Mage Tower whether she liked it or not.However, there was no sign of that happening, and they all seemed to expect Philomel to go to Mage Tower after she finished her business.Continuing to receive their help without clearly expressing her own feelings was no different from deceiving them.Philomel discreetly measured everyone\u2019s reaction. She was worried about how they would feel if she became upset.But they were all thinking something different from Philomel, determined to change her mind before she left the Imperial Palace.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 57": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/There Is No Place For FakesCH 57Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayPhilomel, having understood and accepted their silence, was relieved of her worries. She had one last thing to say to Jeremiah.\u201cJeremiah, umm\u2026\u201dPhilomel cautiously called out to Jeremiah.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry for locking you up yesterday.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You\u2019ve already apologized.\u201d\u201cNow, you can go anywhere you want to go. We talked about everything we wanted to while touring the square today.\u201d\u201cWhat did you guys talk about?\u201d\u201cJust various things.\u201dActually, she had given up on her plan to make Jeremiah on her side. If it resulted in Jeremiah turning against Philomel and siding with Ellensia, it would be a painful loss. However, she didn\u2019t want to use his dark side, which she had learned from the book, to gain favor. That would be the last conscience of someone who secretly peeked into the future through the book. Also, it was the feeling of solidarity she felt as someone who didn\u2019t want to reveal a secret she didn\u2019t want.Philomel hadn\u2019t hidden the book that described her as a fake princess until now. \u2018Even if I start to dislike her, she\u2019s my sister. What could she possibly do? Plus, I have Le Guin with me.\u2019Since it was their last meeting, Philomel smiled brightly at Jeremiah.\u201cJeremiah, please go wherever you want to go. Thank you for today.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201dFor some reason, Jeremiah shook his head and said nothing. Even though he didn\u2019t know why, his fist was trembling.\u201cI don\u2019t want to go!\u201d\u201c\u2026 What\u201d?\u201dPhilomel was surprised by his unexpected reaction.\u201cI wanted to leave, but since you don\u2019t want me to, I\u2019ll give up!\u201dHis eyes, resembling the sky, were filled with betrayal.\u201cI told you yesterday that I would leave even if you stopped me. Why are you like this now?Philomel was beyond bewildered, but had no way to solve the mystery.Anyway\u2026 Jeremiah ended up staying in the palace.***A few days had passed since then.Philemon cleared out her original room and moved to the state guesthouse in Southern Palace.Now, the palace staff called her Lady Philomel or simply Philomel, not Princess Philomel.Though she was not a noble, she was treated as an honorary noble due to her status as a state guest. Actually, her residence and treatment were no different from those of foreign royalty.Le Guin spoke up suddenly, lounging on the couch.\u201cCan\u2019t you just introduce me as your father?\u201dThe workers had finished unloading and organizing Philomel\u2019s luggage at the state guesthouse.Philomel checked to see if everything had arrived safely and answered.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s a bit\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t want to acknowledge me as your father?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThat was the right answer.Le Guin continued, unfazed by Philomel\u2019s silence.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s my fault. I learned of your existence too late, and our first meeting was not very pleasant. It makes me annoyed just to think about it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 But I was the one who cried. Why are you annoyed?\u201cDon\u2019t they say \u2018annoyed\u2019 and \u2018upset\u2019 are different things? Anyway, I\u2019m not feeling good.\u201dPhilemon recalled what Lexion had told her before \u2013 that Le Guin was a complex yet simple person.\u201cLe Guin only has two emotions \u2013 feeling good or not feeling good.\u201d\u201cWhen he\u2019s feeling good, it\u2019s usually because his research is going well, he\u2019s discovered something interesting, or someone he didn\u2019t like got what\u2019s coming to them.\u201d\u201cWhen he\u2019s not feeling good, it\u2019s because someone is continually bothering him\u2026 Well, you\u2019re not going to do that, so don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\u201cIf he\u2019s not feeling good enough to get annoyed, just leave him be. Time will work its magic.\u201dLe Guin continued talking.\u201cIs this maybe a feeling of guilt? Hey, Phil, what do you think?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Imagine how you would feel if you did something wrong to someone else.\u201d\u201cWrong? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cFor example, if you accidentally stepped on somebody\u2019s foot while walking past them.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? But the person who put their foot there is the one who made a mistake.\u201dNever mind. They weren\u2019t getting anywhere.Philemon sighed softly and opened the jewelry box to check on her other belongings.But\u2026\u201cHuh?\u201dPhilomel made an absentminded sound.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cAll my jewelry is gone.\u201dThe white ceramic jewelry box was empty.***Philomel asked the Countess of Deles or the maids about the missing artifact, but they knew nothing either.They were sorry because they couldn\u2019t manage it properly, but Philomel managed to calm them down as they wished it wasn\u2019t them.Frankly, it was not questionable at all.Philomel realized again that she believed in them quite a bit. She didn\u2019t want to blame them for their negligence.\u2018Everyone must have been distracted by my disappearance.\u2019an empty room with many valuables but no owner.Knights also frequently disappear to be investigated because of Philomel\u2019s disappearance. It would have been the best game for the unsub.Even if the valuables were found to have disappeared as a bonus, it was highly likely that all the missing Philomel would be overturned.When the fake princess ran away, she took everything to her ears. What a perfect picture.At that time, Lexion appeared in front of Philomel while taking a walk around the southern Palace.\u201cPhil, you called?\u201d\u201cThank you for coming, Lexion.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201dThe Southern Palace is a place where imperial guests stay and belong to the state, which is outside the imperial palace. Thanks to this, it was good for him, a court wizard, to sneak in. Not only the court wizards\u2019 workplace, but also the accommodation in the outer palace.\u2018It\u2019s relatively easy to do.\u2019Lexion, who heard the situation, raised the frame of his glasses.\u201cThat\u2019s what happened. If you\u2019re going to, let me know\u2026 You mean you\u2019re not going to accuse him of being the official route, right?\u201dAs expected, Lexion spoke well.\u201cThat\u2019s right. If you accuse, the criminal will be punished, but I don\u2019t have anyone in my hands.\u201d\u201cYou want his safety.\u201d\u201cCan I ask you a favor? Le Guin says Lexion is the right person for this kind of thing.\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, there are some people in the capital who know me, so I can listen to Phil\u2019s wishes. But do you want no harm to your body?\u201d\u201cAs long as I can, I\u2019m afraid. It can\u2019t be helped if there\u2019s a lot of resistance.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dThe two faced each other and smiled obligingly. It was the moment when Philomel learned a new aspect of being an elite wizard.The first brother whom I only knew.\u201c\u2026What are you two doing?\u201dJeremiah, who was behind Philomel, looked tired.\u201cJeremiah\u2026 How long are you going to live with Phil?\u201dLexion said in a pathetic tone.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I do.\u201dJeremiah frowned back.\u201cI\u2019ll create a position as a court wizard, so get a job.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201dLexion shook his head.Philomel smiled awkwardly and said cautiously.\u201cI\u2019m alright. I\u2019m sharing a room with Le Guin anyway.\u201d\u201cLe Guin can transform into an animal, so that\u2019s the case, but Jeremiah can\u2019t stay hidden forever.\u201d\u201cHmph!\u201d***After some time, Lexion found and captured the criminal. It was also someone that Philomel knew.What were you doing here?\u201d\u201cYour Highness! Uh, well, that\u2026 I\u2019m sorry!\u201dEmilie, the maid who was standing outside the room in confusion when Philomel met Nassar, was also there. She was also a maid under the orders of Princess Ellensia, spying on Nassar\u2019s actions.Emilie fell to the ground, trembling and yelling.\u201cI am a maid of Princess Ellensia! Even if you\u2019re Philomel, you can\u2019t talk to me like that!\u201dPhilomel spoke softly.\u201cMy jewelry was involved in illegal activities, and the situation hasn\u2019t been fully investigated yet, right?\u201dThen Emilie made a gasping sound.Stealing from the palace, especially from nobles, was a serious offense that could result in capital punishment. Emilie imagined the future that awaited her, and her face kept turning pale.\u201cBut you\u2019re not a real princess, right? So it\u2019s not Philomel\u2019s belongings!\u201d\u201cAnyway, stealing things that I, as a noble, have purchased, is considered a crime. It should be recorded as belonging to the nobility in the books.\u201d\u201cBut doesn\u2019t that mean it automatically becomes the property of Princess Ellensia?\u201dEmilie began to panic and shout.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cNo argument? Then send me to Princess Ellensia! I\u2019ll leave it up to her to decide!\u201dThen, Jeremiah, who was leaning against the wall, looked at Lexion and spoke mischievously.\u201cYou scared her. Did you handle the case properly?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m speechless. I\u2019m not good in that area.\u201dLexion answered coldly with a smirk.Emilie trembled and looked back and forth between the two who were talking.\u201cWho are these people anyway? What are they doing with suspicious people?\u201dIt was noisy.As Philomel demanded, the Emperor blocked off access to the imperial audience hall for anyone except the court officials appointed at a designated time. Therefore, even if Emilie shouted, no one would hear her, but it was still noisy.\u201cEmilie, shut your mouth before you accuse me.\u201dPhilomel sighed softly.\u201cEh, Princess Ellensia would forgive me\u2026\u201d\u201cI bet Her Highness the Princess won\u2019t be able to protect you until the end if I make a formal accusation?\u201dPhilomel raised one corner of her mouth and sneered.Emilie was stunned.Although Nanny has a similar record, it\u2019s easy for people to hold a grudge against themselves. In fact, even to give the impression that she has become more righteous, she will treat you more harshly. It\u2019s too obvious, so I can anticipate it.As Emily thought of Nanny, her heart sank.Even though Nanny had only been in Princess Ellensia\u2019s quarters for a short time, all the maids disliked her.She comfortably laid down and bossed around others. Perhaps it was because she couldn\u2019t control herself, she always tried to control others severely.She was truly an extreme person who dried up her blood.Even the kind Princess Ellensia occasionally frowned upon seeing Nanny.\u201cIf Nanny finds out, it\u2019s the end!\u201dAnd there was another pressure on Emily, that is, Philomel.The former Princess and the current woman in front of Emily were so different.Princess Philomel smiled and overlooked the mistake of the palace servants, was generous when rewarding, and even gave small courtesies.Many palace servants liked the princess, but some followed the trend and tried to please her.Emily was one of those servants.So, if she was firmly denied, she thought she wouldn\u2019t have much to say\u2026She fell to the ground, hitting her head as if she was knocking on it.\u201cI have committed a sin that deserves death! Please forgive me once, and I will do anything for Philomel! Please have mercy!\u201dFinally, Emily found the only way she could survive.Philomel nodded satisfactorily.\u201cReally? Then\u2026 okay.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even if he obeys now, she could betray us at any moment.\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t be easy to betray us when she thinks of the nanny. Lexion said he\u2019s taken measures to prevent any contingencies. I\u2019m not sure what that means, though\u2026\u201dIn response to Philomel\u2019s answer, Lexion approached with a smile.\u201cCome to think of it, Phil still doesn\u2019t know my area of expertise.\u201d\u201cArea of expertise\u2026?\u201d\u201cEach magician has their own specialized field. Guess what mine is? Try to guess once.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dPhilomel pondered seriously.Jeremiah, who had gained the nickname Frozen Earldom, specialized in ice magic. If that\u2019s the case, then what about Lexion\u2026\u201cFire magic?\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t judge by hair color.\u201d\u201cHaha, I\u2019m caught.\u201dAs Jeremiah smirked, Lexion lightly glanced in his direction and opened his mouth.\u201cI can only use fireball that I learned at the age of ten if we go by the fire magic. My area of expertise is this.\u201dHe tapped his temple with his finger.\u201cAre you serious?\u201d\u201cYes, I can cast quite a few useful spells.\u201dLexion stuck out his red tongue.\u201cFor example, if you try to talk about a forbidden subject, your tongue will dry up.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Does that mean you won\u2019t be able to use your tongue for the rest of your life?\u201dPhilomel shuddered.\u201cYou have good comprehension.\u201dJeremiah snorted.\u201cJust kill her. She\u2019s just making a fuss.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. If a dubious death occurs in the royal palace, the magicians will be the first to be investigated. Do you want to be charged with murder?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it just because your skills are lacking?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t have a conversation with an idiot.\u201d\u201cWhat? You little\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dPhilomel simply stopped talking.***Two days had passed since then, but there were no rumors that any of Ellensia\u2019s maids had suddenly dried up their tongues.Emilie seemed to be following Philomel\u2019s orders immediately.Philomel\u2019s orders were simple.She was to ask for information about Ellensia, becoming Philomel\u2019s eyes and ears. In other words, she was just being a spy.Her conscience pricked at her a little, but she had resigned herself to leaving it at the palace. She had an instinctual feeling that walking only the straight path would not lead her to the truth of the book.It was on the way back to her room after her usual walk.In front of the State Guest House, Philomel met a familiar face.A scruffy-looking man approached Philomel with joy.\u201cYour Highness!\u201d\u201c\u2026Martin.\u201dIt was Philomel\u2019s former escort knight, Martin. \u201cOh, long time no see, Your Highness. Oh! So you\u2019re not a princess anymore.\u201d\u201cSo, what brings you here?\u201d\u201cWhy else would a guard come? Of course, I came to guard you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Me?\u201dPhilomel asked with one eyebrow furrowed, unable to understand what he was saying.\u201cOf course. Even if the real princess appears, you\u2019re the only person in this land.\u201dBut Martin just laughed naturally and thumped his chest.Philomel was taken aback.\u2018He\u2019s just sitting here and it\u2019s ridiculous. If he comes here because he has nowhere else to go, there\u2019s nothing I can do.\u2019Martin Siance.He was the younger brother of Viscount Siance and was once a promising knight, but due to his lazy personality, he was now just a mediocre knight.She had forgotten about his existence for a while, but now she saw that he had been kept with other courtiers who had accompanied Philomel.\u2018While it\u2019s good news that other courtiers have been released\u2026 this guy should have stayed locked up.\u2019She hated Martin very much, even though she brought him along for various reasons.She didn\u2019t like the way he pestered her from the first time they met\u2026\u2018He\u2019s just a noble with no substance.\u2019\u2018He stood in front of many nobles, saying he wanted to see the festival.\u2019At the age of nine, Martang witnessed the servants threatening themselves and became even more disgusted.\u201cIt still makes me angry when I think about it.\u201dPhilomel declared coldly.\u201cYou can stop being my escort now.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m firing you from your position as my knight. Find another job.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cLack of diligence.\u201d\u201cWhen did I\u2026?\u201d\u201cYou spent your working hours chatting and playing with other palace members, were late due to hangovers, didn\u2019t participate in regular duels with young knights, and most importantly, you didn\u2019t even know when I disappeared.\u201dAs Philomel listed his laziness one by one with her hands, Martang was at a loss for words.Without hesitating, Philomel summed it up briskly.\u201cIf you want witnesses, there\u2019s plenty. Shall I call them?\u201d\u201cThis is an unfair accusation!\u201d\u201cWhat is?\u201d\u201cYou turned a blind eye even though you knew everything, Philomel!\u201dWell, he wasn\u2019t wrong.Philomel had ignored his faults so far, and sometimes even protected him.Martin cried out, feeling unjust, as he wrapped his head in his hands.\u201cWhy are you blaming me now?\u201dWhy? Well\u2026\u201cBecause you\u2019re the easiest palace knight to handle!\u201dWhen Philomel had dismissed all the maids and servants at the age of nine, everyone present stayed put for the sake of fleeing.From a logical standpoint, Philomel was close to catching a star in the sky by kicking out a fully trained knight and running away.Because the opponent was Martin, she had the opportunity to escape while he was slacking off.\u201cYou didn\u2019t do this before! You trusted and followed me!\u201dNot understanding the circumstances, Martin mistakenly believed that the princess liked him enough to cover up his mistakes.\u201cYou even said that you regard me as your uncle!\u201dBecause people around her, even the Emperor, kept suggesting changing the escort, she told many lies.But she should have avoided saying things like, \u201cmore than anyone, I rely on you.\u201dPhilomel bit her tongue inwardly.\u201cWhy did you change?\u201dAt the moment when Martin was approaching her with his hand to touch her body, the sound of a sword being unsheathed was heard.\u201cWant to die?\u201dA sword blocked Martin\u2019s path.\u201cJeremiah!\u201dPhilomel looked at the person who had suddenly appeared, hiding the scar on his neck with his necklace. Although he had hidden his true intentions, it was clearly Jeremiah.\u201cI told you not to come out of the room!\u201dMartin reflexively stepped back.\u201cWhat, who are you? A knight? You\u2019re not a member of the knights\u2019 association. How did you get into the palace?\u201d\u201cYou can do whatever you want.\u201d\u201cWhat, what? Philomel! Who is this young man dressed in blue?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201dIs he a relative? A guest? How should I explain?\u201cWere you looking for a new guard? Have you found a new guard?\u201dBefore Philomel could deny it, Jeremiah answered.\u201cYes. A new guard.\u201dWhy was he suddenly like that?\u201cFrom now on, I\u2019ll be in charge of guarding her, so you can leave,\u201dJeremiah answered in a cold voice.A little later,Philomel sighed as she looked up at Jeremiah.\u201cJeremiah\u2026why did you lie?\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t lying because I\u2019ll really become your guard.\u201dJeremiah answered indifferently.Martin, who was excited by the mention of a new guard, suggested a challenge instead of a proposal.\u201cLet\u2019s determine who is fit to guard Philomel in a duel!\u201dIf he set his mind to it, he could easily dominate someone like Jeremiah, who likes a child. Since Jeremiah accepted the proposal, the two were on their way to the training area.\u201cDo you really want to be my guard?\u201d\u201cYou have to pay for my meals. You also needed a guard, right?\u201dThat\u2019s true. Eustis had been sending knight lists daily, putting pressure. She had promised the Emperor to keep her guard close, even if she had to give up other palace privileges. She had no choice but to accept him as her guard.So it was better for Philomel in many ways for Jeremiah to become her guard\u2026But there was a problem.\u201cJeremiah, have you been knighted?\u201dThen, Jeremiah pulled out his knight\u2019s badge from his pocket silently.\u201cI\u2019ve been knighted as a magic knight.\u201dUnlike knights who had to go through training for up to ten years, magic knights who applied as mages only needed to demonstrate their abilities and identity to be recognized as knights, even for a short period.This was because there was an absolute shortage of talented people who were proficient in both magic and swordsmanship.She knew he was a mage, but she didn\u2019t know he had knight qualifications. It wasn\u2019t even written in \u2018Princess Ellensia.\u2019 As they arrived at the training area, Martin, who was warming up, caught Philomel\u2019s eye.\u201cPhilomel! I\u2019ll show you the fact that there is no one like me. Let\u2019s fight fairly with real swords, not practice ones, you coward who steals others\u2019 positions!\u201dNot a practice sword, but a real one?Philomel wanted to stop, but Jeremiah drew his sword first.\u201cBe careful. He used to be a pretty skilled knight,\u201dPhilomel whispered.Ignoring her concerns, the match overwhelmingly headed in Jeremiah\u2019s favor.\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cAck!\u201d\u201cUghh, cough cough!\u201dMartin barely escaped with his blunt movements \u2013 a result of years of laziness and overindulgence. In the end, he dropped his sword and fell to his knees, shouting \u201cI surrender! I surrender!\u201d But the sword continued to rush towards Marthein\u2019s neck.Dangerous! Without realizing it, Philomel yelled out.\u201cJeremiah!\u201dHe stopped.As Philomel yelled out, Jeremiah quickly picked up his sword as if nothing had happened.\u2018Jeremiah\u2026 if I hadn\u2019t stopped him, he would have killed him\u2019There weren\u2019t many spectators around the training grounds, but Jeremiah couldn\u2019t be turned into a murderer in front of them.Regardless, this was how Philomel\u2019s position as a princess and high-ranking guest\u2019s escort knight was given to a stranger, a young mage knight.Jeremiah showed off his skills by playing with the princess\u2019 former escort in front of others as if he were a child.Afterward, Jeremiah was called in for an investigation by the palace guards about his unauthorized weaponry.However, with the help of count Polan, who had been asked by Philomel, he was able to pass through without any problems. Unlike the inner palace guards, the outer palace guards had more flexible standards for entry. But it was mostly thanks to Count Polan\u2019s efforts.At first, even Count Polan expressed concerns that Jeremiah might not be a good knight. But\u2026\u201cIn fact, he\u2019s a dear friend I met when I went missing. He\u2019s a noble person who willingly offered his help when I had nothing to offer and fought off the villains with no hesitation. And I wish to continue our relationship\u2026 Is it too greedy if I want that?\u201dPhilomel recounted the incident where Jeremiah had helped her when she was almost tricked by a con artist, further persuading Count Polan to cooperate with her request for Jeremiah to become her escort.Furthermore, even the Emperor promised to help persuade him.Indeed, connections were everything.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Princess Philomel, or rather the woman, had taken away his escort knight position and exposed him for his unfaithful behavior.\u201cDamn it! Why me!\u201dHe was a knight with no job prospects now that he had been kicked out. The aristocratic family had their own way of doing things, and Martin knew he would be ignored.He gritted his teeth, his mind filled with Philomel\u2019s cold face.\u201cShe wasn\u2019t even a noble!\u201dHe had heard rumors that her mother was close to the queen and was a commoner. Martin didn\u2019t even know who her father was.\u201cHe must have been a loser who made his living by rolling around somewhere!\u201dWas he being humiliated by a lowly commoner girl as a member of the Sciences family?He shouted angrily.\u201cI\u2019ll kill her!\u201dBut suddenly, his spine tingled. It was a creepy feeling, like bugs crawling up his body.\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201dMartin suddenly became alert, prepared to defend himself as the last remaining knight.There was a man at the other end of the alley.\u201cMe?\u201dThe man tilted his head and approached Martin. His beautiful face was revealed under the moonlight. His golden eyes glowed brightly.\u201cWho are you?\u201dMartin grabbed his sword tightly in fear.He instinctively knew. That man was different. A completely different being, qualitatively and entirely.The man laughed in a low voice.\u201cA loser who made his living by rolling around somewhere.\u201d The man\u2019s hand gleamed. In an instant, Martin sensed his impending death.\u201cWhy are you doing this to me?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. It just annoys me.\u201dAnd with that, Martin was killed, unable to even scream in his final moments.***Ignoring the gruesome scene behind him, Le Guin spoke without turning around in the dark alleyway.\u201cWhat brings you here, Jeremiah?\u201dJeremiah revealed himself quickly, scanning the scene of the brutal murder in front of him.\u201cWhat about Phil? You said you were an escort knight or something.\u201dLe Guin opened his mouth slowly to reply.\u201cShe\u2019s with Cadin now.\u201d\u201cOh, so you left your brother with her and came here to handle this.\u201dLe Guin gestured towards a barely recognizable figure.\u201cYou\u2019ve always had trouble killing trash, haven\u2019t you? Unfortunately, for you, I was faster this time.\u201dJeremiah simply smirked at Le Guin\u2019s words. Only his father tried to cloak his twisted morality in grandiose terms like \u201cjustice.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough. No matter who cleans up that garbage, it\u2019s enough. \u201cAt the end, I stepped on the scene of grumbling while looking at Philomel, and you were watching, right?\u201d\u201cYeah. We can\u2019t let scum like this interfere with Phil.\u201dBut there was another visitor in the alleyway.\u201cWhat is this?!\u201dLexion emerged from the corner and scowled at the dead body of Martin.\u201cYou\u2019ve done it splendidly. If you\u2019re going to do it, you should\u2019ve done it neatly. Easy to clean up.\u201d\u201cAlways nagging.\u201dYou\u2019re making Le Guin nag again. Why is the blood written backwards, anyway?\u201dLexion grumbled as he walked around the puddle of blood on the ground.\u201cAh, if only Jeremiah had discovered it first and taken care of it.\u201dJeremiah would have killed the person immediately. If it had been him, he would have finished it perfectly, too.But Lexion was a human who preferred positive thinking. He was grateful that no buildings were destroyed just because one person was eliminated, and that it wasn\u2019t Cadin.\u201cMaintain the barrier spell for about 30 minutes to prevent anyone from approaching. It looks like it\u2019ll take that long to clean up.\u201dLexion said lightly, clicking his tongue.\u201cI\u2019m leaving. You guys take care of it.\u201dLe Guin attempted to teleport away with disinterest, but Lexion objected.\u201cWait! Are you going to Phil like that?\u201d\u201cNo?Of course not. If she sees Le Guin dressed like that and faints, what are you going to do?\u201d Lexion continued.\u201cWhat did I tell you before? Even if Phil isn\u2019t entirely kind, her values are sensible. If you don\u2019t want to be hated by her, please hide Le Guin\u2019s true nature. Okay?\u201dAt that, Le Guin tried to flick his outfit\u201cWell, I\u2019ll have to take a shower and change clothes first.\u201dThen he muttered happily.\u201cI don\u2019t want Phil to hate me yet.\u201d***At that moment, the state guest house.Philomel was spending time with Cadin. Cadin said that his break hours were over and left, so only Jeremiah was left.\u2018Come to think of it, I can\u2019t see Le Guin at some point.\u2019Philomel decided to get closer to Cadin during this time.Cadin was the only one of the four rich men Philomel had not talked to one-on-one.He seems like a lively person, but\u2026It wouldn\u2019t hurt to become friends, since they would see each other often.However, it seemed like her decision was in vain, as Cadin was already looking at Philomel with honeyed eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming.\u201dAfter swallowing his saliva, Philomel gathered the courage to ask,\u201cUm\u2026 do you like me, Cadin?\u201d\u201cYes, I do.\u201dCadin answered without hesitation.\u201cWhy do you like me?\u201d\u201cBecause you\u2019re like a younger sister to me?\u201dPhilomel pinched the bridge of her nose with her finger.As she suspected, he had a fantasy about having a younger sister who was cute and pretty.\u2018Probably because he has two younger brothers.\u2019So, Philomel had to break his illusion before he became disappointed.\u201cI\u2019m not a cute person, like you might be thinking about me, Cadin.\u201dIn fact, everyone considered Philomel to be a mature child.In other words, they thought she was like an old woman.\u201cSo, it\u2019s better not to have any unnecessary expectations.\u201dCadin asked with a slightly gloomy expression,\u201cWhat do you mean? My head isn\u2019t that good, so I won\u2019t know unless you tell me.\u201dWas it that difficult to explain?Philomel explained again, \u201cUm, I\u2019m not a very good younger sister.\u201dThen, Cadin who was considering something, asked Philomel a question.\u201cDoes Phil want to hit me?\u201d\u201cWhat? Why would I hit you, Cadin?\u201d\u201cDo you want to curse at me?\u201d\u201cNot at all.\u201d\u201cDo you want to freeze me?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t even if I wanted to.\u201dThen Cadin burst out laughing.\u201cReally? You\u2019re such a good person! You\u2019re a good younger sister, Phil. Good. Good.\u201dIt seemed that Cadin\u2019s standard for a good younger sister was quite lenient.And it was easy to guess who made that standard.Anyway, if it was so easy to become a good younger sister, Philomel felt that she could get along well with Cadin in the future.Just don\u2019t hit, curse, or freeze him, and everything will be fine.Feeling happy, Philomel extended her hand to Cadin.\u201cShall we shake hands?\u201d\u201cIs that okay?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dCadin wiped his hand on his clothes with a tense expression before taking Philomel\u2019s hand. It was a delicate touch, as if handling fragile pottery. Despite the rough and scarred hands, there was a fine delicacy.\u201cI\u2019ll rely on you from now on.\u201d\u201cOf course, it\u2019s me!\u201dUntil a moment ago, Cadin felt burdened, but now he felt like a large dog, eager to go. Philomel raised her hand for the remaining three people.They had all seemed like peculiar individuals at first, but after spending time with them, they weren\u2019t that bad.She felt that they would be able to get along well in the future.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Jeremiah became Phil\u2019s guardian knight?\u201dCadin, who was slow to hear the news, made a fuss.\u201cWhy Jeremiah! I can do it well if you ask me!\u201d\u201cBut you\u2019re not a knight.\u201dJeremiah answered, and Lexion tilted his head beside him.\u201cCome to think of it, didn\u2019t Cadin follow Jeremiah when he took the mage knight qualification test?\u201dThen Cadin slumped and muttered on the table.\u201cI failed the written test.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s surprising. Even a basic knight would know common sense in writing. That\u2019s just a giveaway question.\u201d\u201cThis guy is stupid.\u201dJeremiah snorted.\u201cBut what do you mean by calling your brother stupid? Just say his intellect is a bit low.\u201dTheir father stepped in to stop their quarrel.\u201cQuiet down. Aren\u2019t you guys supposed to be working? Why do you keep coming to see Phil and me every day?\u201dLexion calmly replied, \u201cOf course, we finished our work before coming. And we came to see Phil, not Lord Le Guin.\u201dJeremiah shrugged.\u201cDon\u2019t you know what a guardian is? I\u2019m with Philomel for work.\u201dFinally, Cadin said, \u201cI\u2019m just playing around!\u201dPhilomel just laughed.\u201cHahaha\u2026 I\u2019m glad everyone seems to be enjoying themselves.\u201dShe let out a sigh and handed him what she had brought.\u201cBut, Le Guin. Could you take a look at this for me?\u201dLe Guin picked up the book that Philomel had handed him with his fingertips.\u201cWhat is this? A dictionary?\u201dTo be exact, it was <Princess Ellensia> with the cover of the dictionary.\u201cThis is the book I mentioned before, that I wanted you to investigate personally.\u201dDetermined to discover the truth in the book, Philomel began to read it not long ago about the prophecy.The result was not greatly different from what Philomel already knew.Even the owner of the Mage Tower seemed unaware of the existence of prophecies such as.Frankly, it was more disappointing than expected. However, it couldn\u2019t end with disappointment.Philomel took a deep breath and decided to entrust to him.It just took a bit of time for her to gather the courage. After all, Philomel had never shown the book to anyone before, let alone entrusted it to someone else.She was anxious. Although she had memorized the contents, she had an obsession that she could not do anything without the book. She found that she had relied on the book without even realizing it.When Le Guin tried to open the book, Philomel hastily grabbed his hand.\u201cSorry, but could you try not to look at the contents?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause\u2026\u201dPhilomel hesitated, unsure of what to say.\u2018It\u2019s too much to ask for someone not to check the content when investigating, right\u2026?\u2019But she didn\u2019t want to show the pages containing the contents she didn\u2019t want anyone to see.She had torn up pages that contained contents that she really didn\u2019t want to show anyone.Through various experiments, she found that if there were more undamaged pages than damaged ones, the book\u2019s restoration ability wouldn\u2019t work.Just as Philomel hesitated about showing him the contents.\u201cOkay. If you don\u2019t want to show me, I won\u2019t look.\u201d\u201cYes, thank you.\u201dPhilomel replied hesitantly.\u201cWhat, between us?\u201dLe Guin didn\u2019t seem to matter.Philomel clearly knew that to find out as many results as he wanted, the content also needed to be verified.But I didn\u2019t feel like showing them the book, either. It was also because I didn\u2019t want to show the \u201cPhilomel\u201d in the book, and because I liked them but didn\u2019t believe them completely.Let\u2019s stay together a little longer and show it when we get closer.\u2019Philomel looked down at her fingertips and thought.Le Guin, who received the book from Philomel, looked here and there and said.\u201cI don\u2019t feel much energy, but I should take it to the mage tower and take it to see it.\u201dLexion replied quickly.\u201cYes. Go this time and finish your backlog or urgent work. You never know how much longer you\u2019ll be here.\u201dPhilomel was a little worried to hear that.\u201cAs expected, isn\u2019t there a lot of work to do on the tower?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. It won\u2019t be a big deal if you\u2019re here. I\u2019m the only one who worked at the towerOne sad office worker was young at Lexion\u2019s voice.\u201c\u2026 Cheer up.\u201dThat was all Philomel could say.It was then that a maid\u2019s voice was heard at the entrance of the patronage.\u201cMr. Philomel! Are you here?\u201d\u201cOh, my God, everybody, hide\u2026\u201dThe moment, Philomel was so startled that she said it.Le Guin returned to the cat, and Lexion and Cardin\u2019s figures disappeared in an instant.It was only Jeremiah who sat peacefully in his seat as before.Philomel looked back at the maid, thinking that there was no need to worry that others would reveal their existence.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cYou were in here.\u201d\u201cI was just taking a break.\u201d\u201cI apologize for interrupting. It\u2019s just that His Majesty the Emperor has invited Lady Philomel to a banquet. I recommend it lightly, so you don\u2019t have to feel burdened\u2026\u201d\u201cIs Princess Ellensia going to be there too?\u201dPhilomel interrupted the maid\u2019s words and asked. \u201cYes, that\u2019s correct.\u201dAfter a moment\u2019s thought, Philomel nodded her head.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll go and let them know.\u201dThere was a limit to how much she could hear through other people\u2019s ears if she wanted to know about Ellensia. She couldn\u2019t leave out meeting her directly.***Philomel left for the banquet with the Emperor.Jeremy followed her, and Cadin went back to work before getting caught.Only Le Guin and Lexion remained in the state house.Le Guin was extremely dissatisfied.\u201cWhat\u2019s this? Why is he calling someone else\u2019s daughter?\u201cIsn\u2019t it their side that raised Phil for ten years as their daughter?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? It\u2019s my blood that\u2019s mixed with hers.\u201d\u201cJust because you gave birth to someone doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re the only parent. In this case, Phil recognized their side as her parents. Le Guin, you stayed here because you wanted to be recognized by that child too.\u201dIs that so? I didn\u2019t know that.\u201dThen, after thinking for a while, he opened his mouth again.\u201cShould I just kill them?\u201d\u201cWho? The Emperor? And the Princess too?\u201dLexion asked with a trembling expression.Le Guin spoke absentmindedly.\u201cAre you crazy?\u201dLe Guin, who recalled the memory of Philomel attaching the maid, who was a thief, to Ellensia as a third piece, said.\u201cThe reason Phil is staying here is because of that, princess. Killing her would solve everything.\u201dLexion sighed and rubbed his forehead.\u201cWill you just stay put in the empire? Please refrain from endangering us all the way to the mage tower. I will pass on, going to the underworld with Lord Le Guin.\u201dLe Guin became agitated from a completely irrelevant point.\u201cDo you think I\u2019ll lose? I\u2019m stronger than the emperor.\u201d\u201cWell, if we only consider personal strength, I think Le Guin is superior. He also has a history of winning.\u201dHis gaze under the glasses turned cold.\u201cBut you must know why the Bellerophontic royal family has reigned over the continent as losers for so long. The emperor can wield the power of the gods. Among the past emperors, there were even those who summoned gods in the face of the danger of the country\u2019s demise. No matter how great Le Guin is, how can he handle the gods?\u201d\u201cYou haven\u2019t fought them, so you wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be arrogant for no reason\u2026 anyway, that can\u2019t happen. Remember that if you do, you\u2019ll lose any chance of getting Phil\u2019s favor.\u201dAt the mention of not being able to win Phil\u2019s favor, Le Guin visibly flinched.\u201cShe doesn\u2019t even like murder, and she may have built up some affection for the other side from spending time with them. As I said before, pretend to be a good person in front of Phil.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Alright. I was just saying it for fun.\u201d Le Guin grumbled as he got up from his seat.\u201cI need to go to Mage tower after a long time. It\u2019s also to fulfill Phil\u2019s request.\u201dWith a flash of light, Le Guin disappeared.Lexion also headed out in the background.As if praying, he murmured, \u201cI hope nothing happens while I\u2019m staying here.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She didn\u2019t have to mention her plans.\u201cSo I jumped out to catch it, but the rabbit ran away and ended up wandering all over the mountain.\u201dThe dining table was Ellencia\u2019s solo stage. Her memories of her childhood trickled incessantly. Philomel and Eustis, who were present, were all about arguing with Ellencia\u2019s story.Philomel, slightly distraught, wondered.\u2018Was Elencia originally also such a talkative person?\u2019When she read the book, she didn\u2019t really feel that way. However, there was also no description saying that she was not talkative, so it was difficult to pin a nail on Ellencia and whether or not she was any different from the book.Philomel looked at Ellencia, who smiled.\u201cHehe, even though my body was frozen, it was really fun.\u201dShe had a face that looked innocent. With that face, she almost drove Catherine to death. A crippling suspicion crept up Philomel\u2019s spine that perhaps behind that innocent face a frighteningly different face might be hiding.\u2018No. Don\u2019t be afraid.\u2019Philomel consciously straightened her shrugged shoulders. She couldn\u2019t do anything if she let fear take control of her again. She reiterated her resolve not to run away anymore, instead take everything head on. So Philomel paid close attention to Ellencia\u2019s tales from childhood..The newly discovered Princess\u2019 cheerful voice resonated throughout the dining hall.\u201cSo she asked me to keep the baby rabbits, but her mother wouldn\u2019t let me.\u201d\u201cIf you want, let them grow here.\u201d Eustis suggested.\u201cWow, really? That\u2019ll be amazing!\u201dA friendly atmosphere spread throughout the room. To be honest, Philomel found this atmosphere very awkward. She had eaten quite a few meals with Eustis, but she was not in the same mood now. Conversation came and went like seasoning for cooking, and the two of them focused on the food rather than conversing. But that didn\u2019t mean it looked good.\u2018Too noisy and crazy.\u2019There was less conversation then, but she felt more at ease.As Elencia looked at her father, she said with excitement.\u201cI had the most fun when I skipped the temple service and went to play with my friends. Daddy, did you do something like that too?\u201d\u201cI did not.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dEustis added, perhaps conscious of the fact that his answer was too short.\u201cI have never silently missed a temple service, and I have no friends.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe atmosphere became somber. It felt like something had to be said. Just in time, Philomel, who had been silent for a while, opened her mouth to say something appropriate.\u201cCome to think of it, I also skipped services in the past\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay! I\u2019ll be your friend!\u201dEllencia cut off Philomel\u2019s words as if she hadn\u2019t heard her and started talking again.\u2018It seems that you don\u2019t like me opening my mouth, huh?\u2019Well, that\u2019s ok. Since Philomel didn\u2019t have to deliberately squeeze a comment out, she was rather comfortable like that. Leaving the two to make noise on their own, Philomel returned to observing Ellencia from the side.There were things that could be different about the real princess and the main character of <Princess Ellencia>.There is also the question for what purpose did the author of \u201cThe Princess Ellencia\u201d write the book in the first place? Like other books of prophecy, it bothered her that the narrative form was a novel to be considered as a record of the future she saw. Of all the prophetic books that Philomel researched, none focused more on a personal love story than this one.It was said that there would be a war in the future, that natural disasters would occur, and that magic tools would be distributed without being regulated and ordinary people would be able to use magic freely. There were only some big and amazing prophecies. There must be a reason why <Princess Elencia> was different from other prophetic books.But why? For what reason?\u2018Is there any benefit to the author only in the form of a novel?\u2019But she had no idea what the benefit could be.If the author wanted money or power, he could write a book and inform the Emperor of the existence of the real daughter and get the price. But the author only wrote one book, to say he wanted to spread his reputation as a prophet, one book wouldn\u2019t suffice.There\u2019s way too few clues to crystallize the author\u2019s intentions. The only thing certain about him is that he wrote <Princess Elencia>.But that\u2019s also a clue, no? Don\u2019t they say a book is the mirror of its author? There must have been traces left by the author in the book as well. Philomel flipped through the pages of <Princess Ellencia>, which she knows all too well, in her mind.Personality, preferences, and linguistic habits\u2026Anything was good as long as it reflected the author\u2019s self-consciousness. Now, she desperately looked for even the slightest clue that she may have overlooked in the past. Faint outlines flashed through the innumerable types. Some of them became clearer.\u201c\u2026How are you, Philomel?\u201dHer thoughts that had been running a thousand per second, stopped at once at the unexpected question. The Emperor was staring blankly at Philomel.\u201cYes? I\u2019m sorry, but I didn\u2019t hear.\u201dPhilomel asked in bewilderment.\u201cDo you have anything in particular to tell to me?\u201d\u201cWell. Not really\u2026\u201d\u201cAny topic is fine. I want to hear your story.\u201dShe barely got a strand, but she was talking to him when it\u2019s like this. Philomel was about to say something in order to quickly jump back into the sea of thoughts. But\u2026 she had nothing to say. If the flow of the conversation continued, it was Philomel\u2019s turn to bring up some pleasant memories of her. The problem was that there was no such thing.Politics, diplomacy, high society, if it\u2019s about such topics, she could lead the conversation. But when conversations entered the private realm, Philomel was always the one listening.\u201cOh, um\u2026\u201dDid she have any plausible memories? Looking back, all that came to mind was the boring and monotonous daily life of a Princess. Then an apple from her dessert caught Philomel\u2019s eye.\u2018Right. There was that.\u2019\u201cThe other day, one of the maids brought me an apple pie sold in the Central Plaza, and when I ate it, it tasted surprisingly good. The common people\u2019s food is also quite tasty.\u201dActually, the story was from the time she and Jeremiah went out without Eustis\u2019 knowledge, but she appropriately dramatized it and told it.Eustis\u2019 eyes lit up.\u201cExactly where did your maid say they sell it in the Central Plaza?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 That kid said something about a rainbow.\u201dWhy was he like that? Did he like apple pie?Ellencia suddenly jumped in.\u201cIt\u2019s so delicious, I want to try it! I came to the palace and tasted all kinds of splendid sweets, but sometimes I miss the simple taste of the old days\u2026\u201dIn this way, the initiative of the conversation was again taken by Ellencia. Just as Philomel was now relieved and was about to indulge in her thoughts.\u201cRight. I\u2019ll let the palace chef know to serve you the food you had in the past from time to time. By the way, Philomel, don\u2019t you have anything else to tell me?\u201dEustis cut off Ellencia from talking endlessly and put Philomel into the spotlight once again.\u2018Why are you so interested in me? Leave me alone!\u2019But Philomel swallowed her cry and looked for something else to talk about.\u2018I really don\u2019t have any topic. I can\u2019t help it. It\u2019s a memory I don\u2019t want to recall, but let\u2019s get over with it.\u2019Among the topics that could be mentioned here was one of her fresh experiences that none of these people have ever had.\u201cAs you may know, when I left the imperial palace, and after being found, I was confined to the police detention center\u2026\u201d Philomel\u2019s voice faded.It was because Eustis\u2019 face was fiercely distorted.\u201cYou were in jail?\u201dLife dripped from the low voice.\u201cUh\u2026 yes. Didn\u2019t you hear from the young Duke of Avrydon?\u201d\u201cThere was no report like that.\u201d\u2018This\u2026\u2019Philomel clicked her tongue. Nassar must have left it out by mistake.Eustis sharpened his teeth.\u201c\u2026That cheeky kid.\u201dPhilomel opened her mouth to defend Nassar.\u201cThe little Duke was busy bringing me here. Everyone makes mistakes, so please have mercy.\u201d\u2018It\u2019s because of him that I feel better when I\u2019m punished for something insignificant like this!\u2019Philomel\u2019s persuasion softened the Emperor\u2019s momentum, although his eyes were still unimpressive. Frankly, she didn\u2019t know if Nassar\u2019s omission in the report upset him, but she was glad he calmed down a bit.After that, an awkward current of evil flowed over her frame. Philomel kept her mouth shut, not knowing how the Emperor would react, and he seemed lost in other thoughts. Ellencia, who had only been talking about her bright memories of the past before, for some reason, suddenly started talking about the difficulties of her life in the imperial palace.The meal ended in such discomfort. The Emperor hurriedly left, and Ellencia followed him like a young chick who follows their mother hen. Philomel, who was the last to get up, hesitated. The pungent smell of something tickled her nostrils.\u201cWhat is this smell?\u201d asked Philomel to the maid who was removing the table.At the place she pointed to, there was a small container of seasoning. The maid stopped her action and bowed to her respectfully.\u201cIt\u2019s Hosa powder.\u201dHosa was a vegetable with a spicy taste, and powder made from Hosa was used to add a spicy taste to food.\u201cWhy is Hosa powder here\u2026?\u201dMost people of the Empire did not enjoy the spicy taste. Hosa powder was only used in the extreme regions of the empire.\u201cHer Highness sprinkles it on every meal. Spicy food seems to suit the smell of rats.\u201dIt was Josiah\u2019s seat. The seat where the barrel was placed was Ellencia\u2019s. It was not a coincidence that the author of <Princess Ellencia> came to mind at that moment.[The death god picked up an appetizing red chicken leg. At the addictive spiciness that filled his mouth, he tasted it greedily.]A clue to the author that Philomel just found.The envoys from the conspiracy of the southern country had a secret meeting among themselves. \u2018Appetizing red chicken legs\u2019 and \u2018addictive spiciness\u2019 were quite heterogeneous expressions. Yes, in the Empire, spicy taste was just spicy. There were some people who liked sour tastes or bitter tastes, but it was absolutely not delicious from a general point of view. So far, she thought that it was expressed from the perspective of an envoy who ate food because the locality preferred spicy taste.\u00a0 However, the feeling that the taste of the recording was reflected in the author\u2019s taste became clearer. And Elencia also likes spicy food.\u2018It must be a coincidence\u2026??\u2019She could overlap as many flavors as she wanted, and it\u2019s delicious\u2026Philomel\u2019s hand trembled easily, and it felt uncomfortable, so Philomel squeezed her hand tightly to stop it from trembling.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Count Pollan continued his report with more tension.\u201cHowever, we could not find out the details of what happened at the time. I apologize.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cIt is said that none of those who were at the police station at that time have remained in Angelium to this day. The prisoners who were detained together have all gone missing, and all the police officers are said to have left the city after abruptly resigning.\u201d\u201c\u2026Avrydon\u2019s kid must have interfered.\u201dEustis said in a low voice.\u201cCome to think of it, I heard that Duke Avrydon had hurriedly returned from Angelium, met Miss Philomel, and left the capital the same day. If he had used his resources, I think that would make sense.\u201d\u201cThat arrogant bastard. How dare he hide things about my daughter from me and have it his own way?\u201d\u201cWould you like to bring the Duke in and reprimand him?\u201dCount Pollan asked cautiously.\u201c\u2026No, for now. He is Philomel\u2019s fianc\u00e9e.\u201dAfter a moment of hesitation, Eustis waved his hand in refusal. Seeing this, Count Pollan let out a sigh of relief. There\u2019d nothing good come out if the Emperor had a conflict with the best public servant in the Empire.The Emperor may overlook the young Duke\u2019s actions but not the others involved.\u201cBut one person is enough to show mercy to. Track those who have disappeared. If they are still alive, kill every one of them.\u201d\u201cI will take your order.\u201dCount Pollan, taking his order, brought up another story.\u201cThere is one more thing that I and Your Majesty should know about.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cNow Sir Humphrey is waiting here to report directly to His Majesty.\u201d\u201cTell him to enter.\u201dSoon, Humphrey, the highest-ranking court mage, stepped in. He was an outstanding mage who entered the palace just a few years ago, rose through the ranks and even received a title.After bowing to the Emperor, Humphrey opened his mouth.\u201cThis is a matter concerning the two new court Mages.\u201d\u201cIs there a problem?\u201dThe Emperor\u2019s eyebrows furrowed when only the new court mages were mentioned.\u201cIt may not be a problem, but it bothers me that they are both children of the Dawn.\u201d\u201cChildren of the Dawn?\u201dChildren of the Dawn. It was a name that referred to an experiment in the past and the children born as a result of it.Eustis knocked on the desk and reminisced about his past.\u201cChildren of the Dawn\u2026 A grandiose name was attached to the madness of a mad Mage.\u201dIt was a secret experiment in its own way at the Mage\u2019s Tower, but the scale was large and there were many people involved, so it couldn\u2019t be completely hidden. Countries, including Belerov, were keenly aware of the results of the experiment. It was a natural procedure, as he did not know that a great power might be born in large quantities. It was an experiment as fascinating as it was dangerous. What if the power that was uncontrollable until now falls into their hands? Each one was swollen with desire and salivated.Humphrey spoke cautiously.\u201cThree children were born as a result of the experiment. One is extremely reluctant to show up, so I don\u2019t know, but I know for sure about the other two.\u201dThe expression of Count Pollan, who was listening by his side, suddenly became serious.\u201cYour Majesty, shall we arrest the recruit right now?\u201dEustis stared at Humphrey without answering.\u201cDid you ask them why they became court mages?\u201d\u201cI asked, but they only replied that it was for personal reasons.\u201d\u201cWere the two of them suspicious?\u201d\u201cNo. I kept watching, but there was nothing unusual.\u201d\u201cThen there\u2019s no reason to arrest them. Just keep them under surveillance.\u201d\u201cBut they might be up to something!\u201dCount Pollan exclaimed sharply.\u201cPolan, if you get entangled with the mage Tower and the children of the Dawn, you\u2019ll only get annoyed. Report it then\u2026\u201dEustis smiled arrogantly.\u201cEven if they have other intentions, do you think they are as dangerous to me as their nails?\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cIf their father came directly, the story might be a little different. But he\u2019s not the kind of person who would do such troublesome tricks. I wonder if he\u2019d come in openly.\u201d\u201c\u2026All right.\u201dEventually, Humphrey returned with only orders to watch over the two brothers.Count Polan spoke to the Emperor as he went back to carry out the mandate he had been given. For some reason, the Emperor was making a face that was not refreshing.\u201cYour Majesty, is there anything that worries you?\u201d\u201c\u2026no. No. It must be my delusion. Go.\u201dCount Pollan was puzzled and withdrew.* * *Lexion arrived at the promised place after the time he specified.Jeremiah sighed.\u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d\u201cSorry.I was being watched like a hawk.\u201d\u201cDid they notice?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like I went in under a pseudonym, so there\u2019s nothing I can do about it. Well, even if we had come in disguise anyway, we would have been caught right away. The intelligence power of this country is not to be underestimated.\u201dJeremiah sighed.\u201cCold down well with Cardin. If you leave him alone, he might be under surveillance for the rest of his life.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been careful. With Le Guin\u2019s help, it\u2019s easy to evade Cardin\u2019s surveillance.\u201d\u201cWhy do I have to go through such hardships\u2026\u201dJeremiah clicked his tongue.\u201cTo take Phil. Didn\u2019t you stay because of that?\u201d Lexion continued with a non-trivial tone.\u201cHer existence has not yet been exposed. Please we need to\u00a0 convince the child as quickly as possible\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026Even if it\u2019s persuasion, how are we supposed to do that?\u201d\u201cThe surest way is to change the mage tower into a place that Phil will be attracted to.\u201d\u201cHow?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s simple. Just bring Phil\u2019s favorite things to the Mage Tower.\u201d\u201cWhat does she like?\u201dJeremiah muttered and asked.\u201cThat\u2019s for you and Le Guin to figure out. If you can\u2019t figure that out while sticking by Phil, what are you even doing?\u201dLexion narrowed his eyes.\u201cThink about it. You may have already figured it out.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as that\u2026!\u201d\u201cI heard that the two of you went to the central square last time too.\u201dJeremiah, who was going through his memories, brought it up.\u201cShe likes sweets from a confectionery shop called Cresion.\u201d\u201cCresion is a bit difficult. Since it\u2019s a place with such a high reputation, the owner wouldn\u2019t want to come to the Magic Tower. Should I try to blackmail them?\u201d\u201c\u2026And the apple pie I ate at the crumbling confectionery store was also delicious.\u201dJeremiah remembered Philomel\u2019s flushed face, she showed after she ate the apple pie.\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be difficult. I\u2019ll do the casting.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cOf course. Wouldn\u2019t it be tempting to move to the Mage Tower if you offer very good conditions?\u201dLexion was confident. But the news he brought the next day didn\u2019t.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve been there, but the owner\u2019s family has already disappeared.\u201dJeremiah narrowed his brows.\u201cWhere?\u201d\u201cI left in a hurry since I had a limited period of time where I could disappear without no one noticing. The <Rainbow cookie shop> was also closed.\u201d\u201cIt was in vain.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t be. But where did they go?\u201dTheir doubts were soon resolved. The correct answer was on the breakfast table Philomel received.\u201cJeremiah, look.\u201d This apple pie was made by the owner of the place we ate at.\u201d\u201cWhat? Is he here?\u201d\u201cAccording to the maid who gave me the news, he was suddenly hired as a special employee by the imperial palace.\u201dIt was not nice to lose a card. The Emperor used his hand first. Philomel was completely unaware of the squabbles going on under the water because of her magnetism.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because of me. I once talked about apple pie in front of Ellencia, and she said she wanted to eat it. So I guess His Majesty gave such an order.\u201dJeremiah decided not to give the details to her naive little sister. It was to their advantage that Philomel did not know.\u201cAnyway, it\u2019s nice to have this apple pie here. Now that he\u2019s working in the imperial palace, it\u2019s good for the owner.\u201dPhilomel pushed a spoonful of the pie in her mouth, she made a very happy face as she savored it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 63": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/There Is No Place For FakesCH 63Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTime passed and the season changed and it was already late spring. The high society is already in the midst of preparing for this year\u2019s Debutante Ball. This year\u2019s Debutante Ball is particularly special, so a lot of care was being put into it. All of this is because the newly found Imperial Princess is going to have her first official debut in high society.Invitations flowed everywhere and Philomel also received one as well. The Emperor however said that if it was inconvenient, she did not have to attend.\u2018I can\u2019t do that.\u2019As a State guest, Philomel couldn\u2019t just hide and not appear in front of people and with her luck everyone will assume she has rotten plans. Even so, it was difficult to go and announce to the world that she was not an impersonator of the princess. When the Emperor said that it was not Philomel\u2019s fault that Philomel and Elencia were reversed, a small ripple arose in her heart.Yes. It wasn\u2019t her fault that the two of them were switched, or that she was a fake princess. She suddenly felt embarrassed. Philomel finally was able to feel the resentment she\u2019d had buried deep down out of fear. Why should she live in hiding because of a wrong she didn\u2019t even commit? Even if she left the Empire, if she could not clear her name, she would have to live in the dark for the rest of her life. She didn\u2019t like to live like that. Philomel wants to live alone and free of any dirt.In order to do that, she had to show her confident side to people at least once. She wouldn\u2019t hide. And there was also another, secondary purpose. \u2018That person\u2019 is probably also coming to the Debutante Ball for their debut.\u2018I\u2019m sure this time they moved to the capital and took their first steps in the central high social scene.\u2019Philomel stroked one of her cheeks. It was finally smooth and unscathed now. She looked around the room for something suitable and picked up a cushion on the sofa. Then she began to strike it with her right hand and put all of her strengths into it.Thud! Thud! Thud!\u201cHey, Phil\u2026\u201d\u201cKyaaa!\u201dPhilomel, who was so focused on hitting her cushions, nearly had a heart attack when she heard her name.Le Guin, who appeared out of nowhere, was looking at her with awe-inspiring eyes.\u201c\u2026Please make a sound when moving around. You surprised me.\u201d said Philomel, trying to calm her thumping heart.\u201cI will try harder next time. But why are you hitting the cushion\u2026?\u201dWell, she couldn\u2019t hide it from that person.\u201cI was practicing beforehand because there\u2019s someone I want to slap.\u201dPhilomel replied in a cold voice.\u201c\u2026is it me?\u201d\u201cNo! Why would I slap Le Guin? Someone else.\u201d\u201cOh is that what it is? Then it\u2019s okay as long as it\u2019s not me.\u201dHis reaction was too bland for someone who just heard of his daughter\u2019s plans to hit someone.\u201c\u2026Really?\u201dWhen she asked back in a puzzled voice, Le Guin answered immediately.\u201cWhy not? If you want to slap someone, then you have to do it. I lived my life beating everyone I wanted to beat.\u201dPhilomel didn\u2019t know if her father is a back alley bully or the Mage Tower\u2019s Master. she just shook her head, giving up.\u201cBy the way, what happened to the book I entrusted you with?\u201d she asked, looking at her father, who was lying on her sofa as soon as he arrived.<Princess Ellencia> was still in his hands. And still nothing in particular was found.\u201cI am investigating. I\u2019m back because it\u2019ll take a bit more time to analyze the ingredients.\u201d\u201cOkay\u2026\u201dIt would be nice if there were any new discoveries through research. For some reason, Philomel was lost in her thoughts as she fiddled with the cushion in her hand.\u201cKeep hitting the cushion. I\u2019ll tell you how well you do it.\u201d\u201cAh, yes\u2026\u201dAt Le Guin\u2019s urging, Philomel, feeling embarrassed, started hitting her cushion again. Le Guin, who had been watching her closely, opened his mouth.\u201cYou\u2019re really not good at using your body.\u201dThat was an accurate analysis. The strength drained from Philomel\u2019s slender shoulders very soon.\u201c\u2026Still, it\u2019s important for me to slap that person myself. They still have to return the ring of red flame that they stole from me.\u201dBefore the Emperor finds out that Philomel did not have the ring in her possession, she intended to retrieve it from Roseanne and return it to the imperial family. It\u2019s a national level treasure, but it\u2019s a custom made product, so it shouldn\u2019t be like that originally \u2013 she thought it would be okay to pretend she didn\u2019t know for a while.In fact, there was nothing she couldn\u2019t understand when Roseanne handed Philomel over to the police force. Even if there was someone other than Roseanne, if she was in the same situation, she would have reported the fake princess who had run away. However, she would never forgive being slapped on the cheek. She had to give back what she received to free her heart.\u201cGood. I will help you.\u201dA red magic circle formed in Le Guin\u2019s hand who readily expressed his assistance to his daughter. The same magic circle then appeared at Philomel\u2019s feet and started glowing. At the same time, power surged within her body.\u201cHa!, ha\u2026\u201d\u201cHit it again.\u201dHesitantly, Philomel slammed the cushion weakly. She was obviously trying to hit it weakly. However, the cushion was ripped apart with a loud bang, louder than ever.\u201c\u2026!\u201dThe cushion feathers fluttered through the air. The Mage Tower\u2019s Master laughed out loud.\u201cHow is it? Are you satisfied with this?\u201d\u201cGood! Perfect! A bit overkill, but much better than weak!\u201dThe two of them smiled. Only Jeremiah, who heard the strange noise, made a strange expression.\u201cWhat are you going to do if you don\u2019t want to give your child a reinforcing horse that you only use when going to hunt higher level monsters\u2026\u201dHer sighs were buried in the popping sound of the cushions. In Le Guin\u2019s hands, other magic circles began to be created one after another.\u201cAt this point, I\u2019ll also cast an automatic defense spell on you.\u201dAutomatic magic was magic that was activated regardless of anyone\u2019s will. In other words, automatic defense magic was magic that automatically activated when the Person or the subject it was cast on was in danger.\u201cIsn\u2019t that dangerous to people around you?\u201dPhilomel was also well aware of the existence of automatic defence magic, but gave up because there were many things to be careful about. In order for the magic to be activated automatically, an objective factor was needed to act as a criterion. If it was vaguely based on the physical damage the target received, the magic would be activated even with a weak blow. In an extreme case, it happened in an annoying situation where the magic was activated even if the target was only slightly bumped.Le Guin replied casually.\u201cThere is a possibility that it will result in unintended sacrifices, but it cannot be done.\u201d\u201cNo, you can\u2019t do that. What if a person passes by and our shoulder bumps slightly, and they die?\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll set it to when the other person contacts you with the intention of harming you.\u201d\u201cCan you do that too?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a bit annoying, but it\u2019s possible. If someone tries to harm you, they\u2019ll die painfully in front of your eyes.\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s a little distasteful.\u201dIf she witnessed such a scene, she would be stunned for the rest of her life.\u201cYou\u2019re picky.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing tricky, just plain old.\u201dAfter arguing like that, finally the completed magic circles emerged at Philomel\u2019s feet one by one. As a result, Philomel acquired several layers of magic from the Master of the Mage Tower, which is said to be difficult to receive even after spending a large amount of money. She felt so full that she could strain the food. That day, while testing her magic performance, she broke several more things.* * *Ellencia burst into exclamations when she saw the visitor.\u201cAre you Miss Margaret?\u201dMargaret stooped, thrilled once again that the princess knew her.\u201cGreeting Her Highness, the Princess. This is Margaret Goat.\u201dMargaret Goat. She was a well-known tailor in Elida, but she hadn\u2019t made a name for herself in the Empire yet. It was only natural since she had just returned from studying abroad. However, she was more confident in her skills than anyone else. She had a strong belief that in just one year, she would become a tailor recognized by the whole country. It was a week before the Debutante Ball when the miraculous news of the Princess\u2019 wish came to Margaret, who was full of thoughts of gradually widening her feet from now on. The new Princess wanted Margaret\u2019s dress!It was such happy news that she could even dance in the square right away. All the way to this place in the carriage sent from her palace, Margaret was swollen with her dreams.\u2018What is a year! I\u2019ll be the best tailor in the empire in a month!\u2019The newly appeared Princess was the empire\u2019s greatest concern. What if such a person made her first appearance in a dress Margaret has designed? Just thinking about it made her cheeks go up. Margaret held out a sketch of her own design before her princess.\u201cIf there is a dress you like, please choose it.\u201d\u201cWow! All of them are pretty! Can I choose several?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I only need to make the urgent debutante dress first and then slowly make the other things.\u201dShe had already heard the emperor\u2019s message that if the princess wanted, she could make as many dresses as she wanted and offer them. The princess, who said she had lived on a flat surface until now, excitedly passed over her sketch. Margaret was delighted as she examined her dresses, which her princess took a particularly long time to look at.\u2018These are all expensive dresses.\u2019She found none of Margaret\u2019s dresses cheap, but the princess recognized the splendid and expensive ones among them. That was one of the differences she had from Princess Philomel before her. Thanks to Princess Philomel, who was wary of her extravagance, a trend of thrift prevailed in the social world for a while. It wasn\u2019t that noble ladies were looking for cheap dresses, but as they made them less flashy, the prices of dresses naturally went down. It could be said that it was a dark age for the tailors of Belerov. However, looking at Princess Ellencia, it seems that the time has come for such a dark dawn to come to an end. However, when she looked at her sketch for a while, the princess\u2019s face became blurred.Margaret asked anxiously.\u201cIsn\u2019t there a dress you like?\u201dIt couldn\u2019t be. Wasn\u2019t there a lot of excitement until just now?\u201cNo. I like all of them and they are pretty. But\u2026 there\u2019s not a single one that attracts me to choose as my debutante dress. It\u2019s an important day, so I want to wear the prettiest dress\u2026\u201d\u2018It\u2019s tricky.\u2019Margaret did not lose her sociable smile.\u201cIf your Highness tells me your taste, I will create anything.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 I don\u2019t know much about dresses, but is there a style like this?\u201dThe Princess diligently explained the dress she wanted, even drawing a picture herself. As Margaret listened to the explanation, a strange sense of deja vu bloomed in her.\u2018This is that dress!\u2019It was very similar to the dress she had vaguely envisioned. It was a dress she was confident that if she made it one day, it would be her greatest masterpiece. The princess\u2019s drawing was poor, but her idea was clear. Rather, it was as if the details that Margaret had been struggling with became clearer as the Princess\u2019 real name. As if she had seen it from the future.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Please leave it to me.\u201d\u201cThank you!\u201dMargaret\u2019s brain was already planning on how and where to start, she had to do the dress in a hurry and she had to enlist the manpower needed. Just as the young designer was about to take her leave, the Princess hesitantly asked her one more thing.\u201cUm\u2026 Would it be rude if I asked for just one more Debutante dress?\u201d\u201cAre you planning to entrust me with the dresses you will wear on other days of the Debutante Ball too?\u201dThis debutante banquet would be held for five days longer than usual. It was to commemorate the appearance of a new Princess. Among them, the debut in the true sense was, of course, the first day of the banquet. Usually, the debut dress meant the dress to be worn on the first day. Since the duration was five days, a five-star dress was required to attend every day. No matter how much it was a great honor to be in charge of the Princess\u2019s debutante dress, it was unreasonable for Margaret to make five dresses. There was only a week left until the Debutante Ball. And in the meantime, she had to make two dresses.\u2018I heard they leave the rest to another tailor,\u2019 she remembered.Princess Elencia wiggled her fingers.\u201cActually, a friend of mine is also attending this debut event, and I thought, \u2018Can I make a dress for that kid?\u2019 Oh! Of course, I have no intention of forcing Margaret. If it\u2019s too much trouble, you can deny it.\u201dThe Princess fiddled with her hair.\u201cI\u2019m worried because my friend is in a lot of trouble right now. I want to give her joy with something like this. But it would be difficult to make another dress on such short notice, right?\u201dAttending the debutante meant that her friend was also an aristocrat. The princess, who had just entered the imperial palace and has not officially debuted, has already made friends with other aristocrats?Margaret\u2019s suspicions were soon cleared, the only person that the Princess could be referring to could only be that person. Since she\u2019s still at the Imperial Place as a state guest, it\u2019s highly likely that she ran into Princess Ellencia. The former Imperial Princess Philomel. It\u2019s a relationship that\u2019s likely to be uncomfortable, but the Princess still managed to become friends with her.A warm feeling spread in Margaret\u2019s chest. The Princess\u2019s heart was admirable, so she replied with a smile.\u201cCould that friend be the former Imperial Princess Philomel?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cThen you don\u2019t have to worry. I\u2019m already supposed to make a dress for Miss Philomel\u2019s debutante!\u201d\u201c\u2026yes?\u201dMargaret did not notice that the way Ellencia\u2019s face hardened slightly.\u201cThanks to your Highness\u2019s recommendation of me, it seems that His Majesty has taken good care of me as well. He also entrusted Miss Philomel\u2019s debutante dress to me.\u201d\u201c\u2026Dad?\u201dMargaret couldn\u2019t help but feel that something was wrong with the Princess\u2019 expression, which had clearly changed from before.\u201c\u2026That, that\u2019s right. Is something the matter\u2026?\u201d\u201cHah.\u201dIt sounded like a cold sigh. However, the Princess quickly returned to her original kind face.\u201cThat\u2019s a relief! I hope you make Philomel\u2019s dress pretty too!\u201dMargaret left the Princess\u2019 quarters, bewildered.* * *Nassar visited the palace two days before the Debutante Ball. He scratched his cheek and explained why he couldn\u2019t come earlier.\u201cMaybe it was because I came in blindly the other day, so I couldn\u2019t get permission to enter the palace for a while.\u201dPhilomel, who was walking along with Nassar, thought.\u2018No wonder, last time you barged in without permission after all.\u2019The Emperor had not given the young Duke permission to enter because it was a chaotic situation shortly after Philomel\u2019s return.\u201cThe Duke has a more reckless side than I thought.\u201dNassar was visibly embarrassed.\u201cWhy are you using honorifics? Please feel free to address me comfortably.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t do that. I\u2019m not even a Princess anymore, so how could I call the Duke of Avrydon comfortably\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, Your Highness.\u201d\u201cNo Duke, you should start addressing me correctly. I\u2019m not a Princess anymore.\u201d\u201c\u2026sorry. I will correct it.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to use honorifics, Duke.\u201d\u201cNo. Unless it\u2019s an order.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not an order\u2026\u201dPhilomel decided to just let Nassar do whatever he wanted.\u201cThen how will the Duke treat me? How should I treat the Duke?\u201dAfter seriously pondering over an insignificant question, Nassar opened his mouth.\u201cThen why not call me by my first name like before?\u201d\u201cYour name?\u201d\u201cYes. You always used to call me by my name when we were children.\u201d\u2018Did I?\u2019Come to think of it, it seems that that is the case. She was not conscious of it herself, but Nassar must have been paying attention to her. It wasn\u2019t even a difficult request for her, so Philomel readily accepted it.\u201cIs it so? I\u2019ll do that, Nassar.\u201dNassar smiled brightly. It was a beautiful smile that seemed to brighten up the world.\u201cThank you!\u201d\u201cThen Nassar should call me by name too.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cYou can call me Philomel from now on.\u201d\u201cI, how dare I, call your name\u2026\u201dNassar rattled like a broken tin doll.\u2018What? Or are you going to tell me that you\u2019ll continue to treat me like a Princess?\u2019In that case, if someone listened, Philomel would be in trouble the most. There would be misunderstandings that she still has lingering attachments to the position of the imperial Princess. In order to prevent such an unfortunate incident from happening, Philomel firmly pressed Nassar.\u201cNassar, be sure to call me by my first name. I want you to call me by my first name.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201dNassar, who blushed, added in a small voice after a while.\u201c\u2026Miss Philomel.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to add the \u2018Miss\u2019.\u201d\u201cI cannot do that.\u201dNassar answered firmly.\u201cWow, Nassar, when you\u2019re determined, you\u2019re very assertive.\u201dPhilomel chuckled. Nassar\u2019s gaze, which had been laughing at Philomel, suddenly turned to her back.\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you around before, are you Miss Philomel\u2019s new escort?\u201dJeremiah, who had taken a completely different appearance, looked at them with his stubby face. When Jeremiah had to escort Philomel to the outside of Southern Palace or when Philomel had guests over, he\u2019d disguise himself with the power of the necklace he once lent her. Originally, he could only use allowed magic items on the Palace grounds due to the effect of the Imperial Palace barrier, but when Le Guin touched it, the necklace quickly found its function.Jeremiah responded with his characteristic impoliteness.\u201cCan\u2019t you tell just by looking at me, I\u2019m an escort.\u201dPhilomel approached Jeremiah and lowered her voice.\u201cJeremiah, you should be respectful.\u201d\u201c\u2026Shit, I apologize to the great little duke. I\u2019m the new escort.\u201dNassar did not change the color of his face and accepted it flexibly.\u201cI see. It must be our first meeting, but it feels strangely familiar. Perhaps we met somewhere\u2026?\u201dCome to think of it, it was said that when Nassar came back from Angelium, he accompanied Philomel\u2019s three brothers. It seemed that he couldn\u2019t recognize him now because of the effect of the necklace, but there was nothing good about being caught by him.Philomel hurriedly grabbed both of them by the arms.\u201cHaha, Jeremiah has a rather common face. In the future, the two of you will see each other often. How about shaking hands?\u201dThen Jeremiah tilted his face awkwardly.\u201cWell, maybe not often.\u201dNassar said firmly and reached out his hand first.\u201cIt will be often.\u201dThe two joined hands. Strangely, it was a handshake that seemed to have taken too much force. She thought only Jeremiah was harsh, but Nassar\u2019s eyes weren\u2019t quite as nice.\u2018Aren\u2019t the two of them very incompatible?\u2019Philomel thought she should avoid having the two of them encounter as much as possible.After giving Jeremiah a harsh look to prevent friction between the two men, Philomel and Nassar continued their walk. However, a disturbing scream came from far away. A maid was hanging out under a large tree. She was Emily, whom Philomel used as a spy.Emily exclaimed, looking up at her tree.\u201cYour Highness the Princess! Stop and come down! You\u2019ll get seriously hurt!\u201dIt was only then that the figure of a young woman, hidden between the leaves, was revealed. Ellencia was hanging from a tree and climbing up. Philomel\u2019s eyes widened at the appearance of the unexpected person.\u2018What are you doing here?\u2019This palace was far from the West Palace where Ellencia lived.Standing on the lowermost stem, Ellensia reached her hand higher.\u201cButterfly, I\u2019ll save you!\u201d\u2018Butterfly?\u2019She couldn\u2019t see her closely because she\u2019s far away from here, but Ellencia seemed to be trying to save a cat on the tree. Why Ellencia had moved all the way here and why she\u2019s putting all her heart into rescuing a cat, was beyond Philomel.Nassar\u2019s words helped to understand Philomel\u2019s embarrassing situation.\u201cThat\u2019s Princess Elencia. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen her.\u201dYes. This is the first meeting between Ellencia and Nassar.\u2018It\u2019s when the two people fall for each other!\u2019The first meeting of the two of them in <Princess Ellencia> unfolded in Philomel\u2019s head. The situation was pretty much the same as now. Ellencia was also climbing a tree. She was in the middle of returning the fallen baby birds back to their nest, but she ended up falling from the tree. At that time the person who happened to pass under the tree was Nassar. He caught the falling Princess wonderfully and the moment their eyes met, they fell in love at first sight. Nassar thought Ellencia was an angel falling from the sky or something like that.Why is a similar situation like the novel still happening, even though a lot changed and Ellencia came to the Palace a year earlier?Is this fate?Goosebumps rose on Philomel\u2019s back from the exquisite arrangement of fate.Philomel squinted at Nassar next to her. She wondered if he would really fall for Ellencia at this moment. At that time, Nassar, who had been watching Ellencia, opened his mouth.Philomel was nervous. What is going to be his reaction when he sees the woman he would passionately love in the future?\u201cShe looks like a monkey. It\u2019s amazing. She makes a good nuthatch too.\u201d\u201c\u2026Is that all?\u201d\u201cWhat more is there?\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s alright.\u201d\u2018No, that\u2019s a compliment in its own way, but\u2026 But could he see a monkey in the princess?\u2019Did he fall in love only after accepting that too? Philomel tilted her head.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Where is Her Highness\u2019 escort knight?\u201d he murmured calmly.In the meantime, Philomel and Nassar closed the distance between them and the tree. Philomel could now also see the outline of a cat hanging on the tree. Where Elencia stretched out her hand\u2026 A cat with silver fur was showing its teeth as if saying \u2018Why are you out there!\u2019The cat continued to be hopeless. There was no way he could climb the tree and not come down. However, Ellencia seemed to be so mistaken.Ellencia gave the cat a word of hope.\u201cAren\u2019t you scared? Wait a bit. Come down and I\u2019ll give you some delicious fish, so don\u2019t be afraid!\u201dLe Guin was engrossed in washing his face as a cat, regardless of who else below him.\u201cWhat are you doing there!\u201dPhilomel unknowingly ran out. Only the determination to retrieve that cat quickly was firm.\u201cMiss Philomel!\u201dNassar followed her.As Philomel neared her tree, Le Guin spotted her and jumped down from the tree.The cat came snugly into her bosom. it was successfully received.\u201cAlas! Ah\u2026\u201dBut at the impact Philomel stumbled and tripped on the roots of the tree, falling down on her buttock. But the bad luck didn\u2019t stop there.\u201cYour Highness the Princess!\u201dElencia, who was hanging on the tree previously, was falling. That\u2019s right, on top of Philomel, who closed her eyes tightly. But the shock she had foreseen did not overtake her.\u201cAre you all right!\u201dWhen she opened her eyes, Nassar was looking down at Philomel anxiously. When Philomel did not answer, Nassar\u2019s expression darkened even more.\u201cAre you seriously hurt?\u201dThe answer to the question came from a completely different place.Elencia shouted cheerfully.\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201dLanding on the floor, she gracefully lifted the hem of her skirt.\u201cHello. Thank you for saving me. May I ask your name?\u201dPhilomel realized that this is the moment where the two of them will fall in love with each other. She got up hastily and tried to get away from them. It was then that Jeremiah, who had been far away, came running to her.\u201cYou! Are you okay? Did you fall down?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, I\u2019m fine. Let\u2019s find a quick place to hide\u2026\u201dPhilomel didn\u2019t intend to go far, she wanted to observe the two of them from a distance. It was a good opportunity to observe how Elencia reacted. However, things went the exact opposite of what was expected.A familiar voice erupted from Philomel\u2019s back.\u201cWait!\u201dNassar followed after Philomel, leaving Ellencia behind by the tree.\u201cWhy are you going? Your Highness?\u201d\u201cI asked for your understanding to not refer to me by that title anymore, your grace. The title of the Imperial Princess belongs to their rightful owner. Please use my proper name to address me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry Miss Philomel I got carried away. But are you hurt anywhere? I apologize, if I had been a bit more alert, I could\u2019ve prevented Miss Philomel from falling down.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Alright now and I\u2019m not hurt. But Nassar\u2026 Aren\u2019t you in a strange mood right now?\u201dPhilomel studied Nassar\u2019s face for signs of his love.\u201cWhat does Miss Philomel mean by strange mood?\u201d\u201cFor example, is your heart pounding?\u201d\u201c\u2026A little bit.\u201dHe averted his gaze.Has he already fallen in love?\u201cDo you want to go to Princess Elencia?\u201d\u201c\u2026Do I have to go?\u201dFor some reason, Nassar looked sad at Philomel\u2019s suggestions to go back to Ellencia.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll stay here.\u201dNassar answered, taking a step closer to Philomel\u2019s side. In the end, Philomel had no choice but to admit it. Nassar didn\u2019t fall for Elencia.Another outcome that was different from <Princess Ellencia>.* * *Eustis, who was on his way back to his chambers after a political meeting, when Ellencia suddenly ran towards him and looked grim.\u201cDaddy daddy!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m hurt here.\u201dShe held out her right ankle. There were faint traces of something. She didn\u2019t have any serious injuries or scars, but judging by her whimpering, she seemed pretty hurt.\u201cI need treatment. Call for a physician.\u201d\u201cAnything else besides that?\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cDad, when you see my wounds, don\u2019t you think you need to treat them?\u201d\u201cThen what else do I need to think about?\u201dEllencia\u2019s face immediately distorted.\u201cDad! Your daughter is hurt, how can you not worry?\u201dEllencia, who got angry at the lack of the attention from her father, ran in the other direction. But judging by the way she jumped, Eustis concluded that she wasn\u2019t seriously injured.Eustis said in a low voice.\u201cI have no idea what that kid is thinking.\u201dCount Pollan, who was watching from the side, cautiously spoke up.\u201cThis is my guess, but I think her Highness probably wanted a warm response from Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cA warm response?\u201d\u201cYes. His Majesty\u2019s reaction is a bit businesslike.\u201d\u201cAre you saying it\u2019s wrong to treat an injury?\u201d\u201cNo, no. It\u2019s not wrong, but Her Highness would be happy if you greeted her more warmly.\u201dThen the Emperor, who was briefly lost in thought, opened his mouth.\u201cThen you do it.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve got children, so you must know \u2018that warm reaction\u2019.I\u2019m not sure, so show me an example.\u201d\u201cHaha, why would I do something like that here\u2026\u201d\u201cHurry.\u201d\u201cHow would you react if your child came to you injured?\u201dPolan knew from years of experience of serving the Emperor that he was very serious. And that he\u2019ll get the short end of the stick if he showed his Majesty a poor demonstration.\u2018If my daughter came back with her ankle hurt, I would\u2026\u2019Polan portrayed his imaginary daughter, lowered his stance, and put his heart into the performance.\u201cOh, my daughter, are you hurt? Your legs are all damaged. Dad will protect you! Who dared to hurt our Princess? What kind of stone? I\u2019ll throw it away!\u201dHalfway, the count got too engrossed. He imagined it way too realistically, and it ended up hurting his weak heart.Eustis\u2019 contemptuous gaze turned to Pollan.\u201c\u2026Really?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cYou have no face.\u201d\u201cYes! But how can you save face in expressing love to your children!\u201d\u201c\u2026Can\u2019t I lose face.\u201d\u201cAt least that\u2019s what I think. What if the child grows up and leaves after worrying about this and that and not being able to hear enough \u2018I love you\u2019. It\u2019s so sad.\u201dThe Count explained his stand on the matter.\u201c\u2026I see. I did not know. I thought all fathers were like that.\u201dSeeing his lonely back, Polan chose his words.\u201cEven now, it\u2019s not too late. No, even if it\u2019s late, don\u2019t stop approaching.\u201d\u201c\u2026I get it. I will try to do the same as you.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cThe warm response you showed me, I will do it too.\u201d\u201c\u2026Wouldn\u2019t it be a bit difficult to suddenly change like that? Moreover, Her Highness Princess Ellencia is not three years old like my daughter\u2026\u201d\u201cThe basic gist is not different. The trick is grasped. Isn\u2019t it just a matter of making an exaggerated fuss about the child\u2019s wound, treating it, and then removing the cause of the wound?\u201dThe Count questioned, \u2018Is that how it is?\u2019, but couldn\u2019t actively dissuade the Emperor. It was because he was afraid to say anything else on the subject of actively recommending love for children while thinking about approaching them. But Pollan\u2019s hesitation led to another incident.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was reprimanding Le Guin who\u2019d returned to his human form.\u201cWhy were you climbing the tree?\u201d\u201cI just like it there, can\u2019t I be there?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like you can\u2019t, but when Ellencia saw you and wanted to save you, you should\u2019ve come down.\u201d\u201cAh. That kid who looked stupid? But why should I?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because Ellencia was almost hurt\u2026\u201d\u201cIt has nothing to do with me whether she gets hurt or not.\u201dIn hindsight, that\u2019s it. Philomel was well aware that Le Guin, who did not possess any emotions, was not so amiable. But his mood was a little strange. If his interest in Philomel faded, then she too, might be treated the same way.\u2018I need to finish my work here before that time comes.\u2019She glanced at the clock.\u201cIt\u2019s already time. I have something to do, so I\u2019ll get going.\u201dPhilomel got up from the couch, but the moment she stood on her feet, a stabbing pain radiated from her hip, causing her to fall back into the couch.\u201cOuch.\u201d\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d\u201cYes. When I fell down earlier, I must have bruised myself.\u201d\u201cShould I use healing magic on you?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s really nothing.\u201dPhilomel was ashamed to ask for treatment. She pretended to be fine and acted as nonchalantly as possible, as she got up again to leave. However, her movement became more and more ragged. She was in pain\u2026 but since she was already halfway to her destination. She reasoned that when she got the urgent matter handled, she\u2019d visit the Court Physician\u2019s office to get treatment.Philomel\u2019s destination was the Emperor\u2019s office. An attendant brought a message from him requesting a visit anytime soon. She speculated it was a matter related to her treatment as a state guest. Philomel gathered her strength and somehow reached the Emperor\u2019s office.\u201cHello, how are you doing your Majesty?\u201dShe greeted him normally, but the nape of her neck was wet from sweat. The Emperor was staring at her with fierce eyes.\u2018What did I do wrong?\u2019Philomel\u2019s heart sank.\u201cPhilomel.\u201dHe approached slowly, calling her name in a very low voice.\u201cWha- what is it your Majesty?\u201d\u201cAre you feeling uncomfortable anywhere? Your gait is ragged.\u201d\u201cOh, I fell down earlier. It doesn\u2019t hurt that much, so don\u2019t worry\u2026\u201d\u201cNo. You are not looking good.\u201dNot looking good? What does he mean by that?\u201cYour condition is very serious. It is a miracle that you are even walking.\u201dEustis made Philomel\u2019s small injury sound a dozen times more serious than it is.\u201cI\u2019ll call the Court Physician right now!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll pay him a visit later! There\u2019s no need for it!\u201d\u201cHow did you fall?\u201d\u201cWhile taking a walk I got caught in the roots of a tree\u2026\u201d\u201cI get it. I will cut down all the trees in the imperial palace.\u201d\u201cWhy? There is really no need to go that far!!\u201d\u201cPhilomel, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll take care of everything.\u201dWords, words don\u2019t reach him at all.\u2018Are you crazy?\u2019Philomel turned to Count Pollan looking for an explanation from him. But the Count became contemplative and only shook his head. As Philomel\u2019s face gradually became as pale as a ghost, the Emperor felt that something was truly wrong with her.\u201c\u2026 Majesty, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s see each other later.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t too early to express it that way! Pollan cried out in silence. After Philomel received treatment from the Court Physician, the Count resolved her misunderstanding.* * *The day of the Debutante Ball finally dawned. Philomel looked at her new dress through the mirror. She didn\u2019t need a new dress, but it was made by a tailor sent by the Emperor. When she tried to send it back, the tailor complained, saying that she could just wear it for the first day of the banquet.\u2018The Emperor and the princess both requested this dress to be made for her; she can\u2019t abandon the work entrusted to her by the two of them.\u2018Philomel could roughly guess that\u2019s what the tailor was thinking.In this Debutante Ball, the person who would attract the most attention after Ellencia, was Philomel. The tailor probably doesn\u2019t want to miss the opportunity to not only dress Princess Ellencia for her Debut but also Philomel.\u2018It\u2019s surprising that Ellencia asked for a dress to be made for me though, but\u2026\u2019After all, is this Ellencia also like the kind hearted protagonist of <Princess Ellencia>? Then why didn\u2019t she show her good side only in front of Philomel? The obvious answer was \u2018hypocrisy\u2019, but Philomel decided not to judge hastily. Debutante Ball, which was right in front of her, was an urgent priority and the best opportunity to observe Ellencia better.\u2018Let\u2019s calmly think about how Margaret, who has not yet become famous at this point, came to be in charge of Ellencia\u2019s dress.\u2019\u201cI asked you to be as frugal as possible.\u201dThe cream-colored dress Margaret had sent was elegant and simple, but it could not hide the luxuriousness that oozes out in places. Well she had to be content with the fact that it wasn\u2019t too flashy. Le Guin, who had been watching Philomel, opened his mouth.\u201cIsn\u2019t it boring? The Nobles outfits I\u2019ve seen are more luxurious.\u201d\u201cWhat would a guest living in the imperial palace do with so much luxury? People would curse me for being too extravagant with their tax money.\u201d\u201cIf there\u2019s someone who dares to curse you, can I take care of them?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dLe Guin just being still and not doing anything reckless, would help her tremendously.\u201cNo. Just watch me from afar and don\u2019t do anything.\u201dPhilomel wondered if her response was too cold and short, so she resorted to flattery for the first time in a while.\u201cBecause there would be nothing good if an incident were to happen. And Le Guin is a great source of strength for me by just being by my side.\u201dHe put a strengthening spell on her, so she was physically strong. After receiving Le Guin\u2019s magic today, Philomel\u2019s whole body was overflowed with energy. She looked forward to reuniting with Roseanne with anticipation.Philomel chuckled thinking about it, and Le Guin, who was observing his daughter, immediately felt better for some reason.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019ll take care of it today. I just had a good idea.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what that is, but wouldn\u2019t it be better not to do it\u2026?\u201dBut Le Guin didn\u2019t pay her any attention and disappeared with a flash.\u2018I don\u2019t feel good for some reason\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m inclined to lean, right?\u2019Philomel thought with a small sigh. She was then escorted to the Imperial ballroom hall by Jeremiah. After learning manners and transforming into a decent knight, he firmly supported Philomel\u2019s hand as she climbed into the carriage.\u201cCome out whenever you want.\u201dHis blunt words were tinged with concerns for her.\u201cThank you Jeremiah.\u201dPhilomel thought to herself.\u2018Only Ellencia\u2019s face will shine through tonight and heal all. Don\u2019t worry about me.\u2019\u201cAre you going to dance?\u201d\u201cI think I\u2019ve danced to my heart\u2019s content in the past. I\u2019m not a young girl who\u2019s debuting this year, so there\u2019s no need to dance.\u201d\u201cI see. But if you want, I don\u2019t mind being your dance partner\u2026\u201d\u201cJeremiah? Dance?\u201dIt didn\u2019t suit him so much that Philomel burst into laughter. Well, Jeremiah was also a knight, so he could attend the ball if he wanted to, but she couldn\u2019t imagine him dancing.\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny about it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I won\u2019t dance but thank you for your offer, I\u2019ll take your sentiment.\u201dWhile Jeremiah laughed at her with his jokes, the carriage arrived at the outer Imperial ballroom hall. She dissuaded Jeremiah from entering with her, and Philomel entered the hall alone. She was grateful for her father\u2019s and her brothers\u2019 hearts, but this was a burden she had to carry alone. She\u2019s a fake princess. A character full of rumors. No matter what kind of life Philomel chooses, the majority\u2019s interest would naturally follow.She wouldn\u2019t be able to stand alone for the rest of her life if she avoided this moment out of fear. She couldn\u2019t be protected forever, and this was the weight Philomel had to bear alone.\u2018It\u2019s okay, it\u2019s not much different from when I gave a speech at the festival when I was young.\u2019Philomel walked into the venue with dignified steps.\u201cLady Philomel is here!\u201dEveryone\u2019s eyes turned to Philomel at once. Their astonishment, their observation, their search, their interest, their arsenic, all of their attention weighed heavily on her.Philomel, unwilling to lose, straightened her back and walked further inside with her head held high. The crowd split on either side, giving her way. A few stared at her without even trying to conceal their gazes.\u2018It\u2019s good to be confident, but this is a bit burdensome\u2026\u2019Philomel was trying to get into a corner, a place where she would be less visible to people.\u201cThe Sun of the Empire, His Majesty the Emperor and the Little Sun, Her Highness the Princess are entering!\u201dThe father and daughter\u2019s appearance shifted the attention that had been focused on Philomel to them. They came out holding hands from the entrance dedicated to the imperial family on the second floor. Philomel was appreciative of the strange sight in front of her, as if somehow familiar.Ellencia made a surprised expression upon entering the hall and seeing so many people, but then she waved happily at them.\u201cYour Highness the Princess.\u201dAn exclamation flowed among the public. Even though it went against etiquette, on the contrary, it must be attractive because of it. How fresh and interesting the princess who grew up among commoners for over 16 years must be to the nobles. It was also described in detail in <Princess Elencia>. The overly callous Emperor and the benevolent and warm Princess, the conflicting yet harmonious father and daughter, became a picture just by being together.Unlike Philomel.\u2018I had to watch my every step and follow the etiquette diligently, so people wouldn\u2019t brand me as an uneducated Princess. But Elencia is liked even if she doesn\u2019t follow them.\u2019She was confident in that position in her debut just two years ago. At that time, she just wanted to quickly get out of that position. But why was a corner of her heart bitter? Even though the place she was missing was so perfect. However, Philomel shook her head instead of tearing her expression down. She had no lingering feelings for that position. No, she shouldn\u2019t.\u201cListen! This is Princess Ellencia!\u201dFortunately, Count Pollan started making announcements about Ellencia, so Philomel was able to divert her attention to something else. The Count explained the birth of Ellencia, how she came to be reversed with Philomel, and how she returned to the imperial palace. Of course, the circumstances of their reversal were lies to cover Catherine\u2019s crimes, and the process of her return was also mixed with fiction. In the Count\u2019s story, Philomel was considerably glorified. She was a benefactor who gave up her existing position and took the risk of being driven out as a criminal in order to find the Emperor\u2019s real daughter. Even if Philomel had left Ellencia alone anyway, a year later, with Catherine\u2019s confession, she would have come to the palace. It was not unreasonable for those who did not know that, to regard Philomel\u2019s actions as righteous.\u201cAccordingly, the Belerov family expresses deep gratitude to Lady Philomel for her kindness, bestows her with the highest medal, and promises to honor her as state guest!\u201dApplause erupted from all directions at the Count\u2019s impressive eloquence. Philomel was ashamed and wanted to hide in a mouse hole. Fortunately, as the subject soon shifted to Elencia\u2019s middle name, Philomel was able to escape attention as well.People cheered when Her Holiness the high Priest was presented with the middle name of Ellensia. It was a symbol that the divine protection of Belerov was still in this land. Everyone waited for the princess\u2019s middle name to be announced. Philomel, who\u2019d read the book, knew it even if she hadn\u2019t heard of it. Ellencia\u2019s middle name is going to be Halypso, Elencia Halypso Bellerov would be her full name. It was revealed at the end of the book, but \u2018halypso\u2019 meant hope that was not included in the ancient language. In other words, Ellensia\u2019s existence itself represents hope\u2026\u201cThe name the high Priest has heard is Taspel!\u201d\u2018\u2026?\u2019\u201cThis is Her Majesty Ellencia Taspel Belerov!\u201dThunderous cheers and applause filled the hall. Philomel looked at Elencia, who was smiling at everyone\u2019s attention.\u2018Taspel? Isn\u2019t it Halypso?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 67": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/There Is No Place For FakesCH 67Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter the shocking revelation that Ellencia\u2019s middle name is different than in <Princess Ellencia>, Philomel, confused, escaped to the break room to organize her thoughts. The ball had just started, so no one was already using the designated break room to rest. She couldn\u2019t even get used to it\u2026 Elencia should be doing her first dance by now, and everyone would be anxious to look good for the new princess. Philomel went back and forth anxiously in the empty break room.\u2018Why did your middle name change? Is this also because I moved the timing forward by a year?\u201dLet alone Nassar not falling for Ellencia because she yielded a hundred times, or Eustis maintaining a subtle distance from his daughter. The same goes for Ellencia\u2019s personality, which has changed to be like someone else\u2019s. It was not possible to know where people\u2019s hearts would end up, but were the works of gods the same as people\u2019s? Was it okay to change her name just because the story succeeded a year early? In the temple, the middle name of the royal family reflects their soul. One\u2019s middle name only changes when one commits countless sins under that given name. You could say their name changed, so their soul\u2026Philomel shuddered at her fleeting thought at that moment.\u201cIs that possible?\u201dNo, wouldn\u2019t it be more plausible to assume that <Princess Ellencia> was not a completely prophetic book? However, the question, once raised, was not easily quenched.\u2018What if, this is really, what if\u2026\u2019Maybe the Ellencia over there right now was a different soul from the Ellencia in the book. Also there was Catherine\u2019s words, insisting that Elencia had changed, like a completely different person.\u2018Is she possibly possessed by an evil spirit?\u2019It reminded her of cases of people who became violent overnight because of the evil spirit dwelling in their bodies. Although Elencia did not become violent, it was clear that her personality had changed for the worse.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Then the door to the break room opened.Philomel was startled, but when she saw the figure that soon appeared, she relaxed. It was Nassar.\u201cYou\u2019re here. I was surprised by your sudden disappearance.\u201dNassar arrived today, dressed in a stylish fashion.\u201cAren\u2019t you going to dance?\u201d\u201cNo. I don\u2019t want to dance today.\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s a pity.\u201dRather than asking, \u2018Why do you say that, Nassar?\u2019, there was a quicker thought.\u201cBut why is Nassar here? Aren\u2019t you dancing?\u201d\u201cI have no thoughts of dancing today either.\u201d\u201cShouldn\u2019t you have your first dance with Her Highness Princess Ellencia?\u201cWith the princess? She asked me, but I declined.\u201dDid this guy just come out of the boat? It seemed that the Emperor\u2019s wrath was not scary. When asked why Nassar turned down the first dance with Elencia, he replied:\u201c\u2026That\u2019s because my fianc\u00e9 is not Her Highness Princess Ellencia, but Miss Philomel.\u201dIt was only then that Philomel realized that the two were still engaged.\u201cWhy? It\u2019s a marriage conversation between the imperial family and the duchy. Isn\u2019t it automatically destroyed at the point when it is revealed that I am not the princess?\u201dIn the book, things went that way, and Nassar and Ellencia danced without a hitch. In real life, even though Nassar had no crush on Ellencia, Nassar was the only one she could dance with. Up until now, Nassar was the only young lord of Ellencia\u2019s age.\u2018Wait, then who is Ellencia doing her first dance with?Philomel opened the break room door out of curiosity and stepped out into the hallway. In the hall, the princess was performing her first dance to the sound of music. The person who hugs Ellencia\u2019s body in line with her melody was\u2026\u2018Hero Killian!\u201dA tall man with blue hair was holding Ellensia\u2019s hand. Killian, a veteran who defeated Cerberus, the highest level monster. He was the son of Count Escal, a prestigious aristocratic family, but he was usually referred to as a hero. In the current era, the first person who comes to mind when the name \u2018Reply\u2019 comes to mind. And Ellensia\u2019s third man.In <Princess Elencia>, there were a total of three men involved in a romantic relationship with Ellencia. Little Duke Nassar, Mage Jeremiah, and Hero Killian. According to the book, it\u2019s a bit later that Killian becomes interested in Ellencia, but what happened? Originally, he did not attend the Debutante Ball. He said he was sick of the world of aristocrats, which was only a facade.More and more accounts are unfolding that are not in line with <Princess Ellencia>.Nassar, who came out alone following Philomel, stared at Ellencia and Killian.\u201cThey\u2019re a good pair.\u201dIt was an extremely peaceful expression, as if it were someone else\u2019s business. Nassar really didn\u2019t seem to have any feelings for Ellencia. Finally, after the Princess\u2018s first dance, the music stopped. Next was the stage of young aristocrats making their debut this year. Young ladies and lords performed their first dance with a designated partner, then switched partners and danced again.Philomel anxiously searched for someone in the ranks. But Roseanne\u2019s red hair did not go unnoticed. Where was she? Could it be that she didn\u2019t come because she was afraid?\u201cPhilomel\u2026\u201dLooking to the side, Nassar couldn\u2019t take his eyes off Philomel\u2019s face.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cAt first, I thought it was because of my mood.\u201dNassar stammered.\u201cIt may be rude to say this, but today, ah, you look very beautiful.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cThe moment I entered this place, I only saw you.\u201dWhy was he doing this? Did he eat something wrong? But it wasn\u2019t just him watching Philomel in awe. Even the nobles around her, or even their young children, gazed at her for a long time, then looked away quickly when her eyes met theirs. She had never received such an enthusiastic response even when she was a Princess.\u201cNassar, is there something on my face?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that, but the light\u2026 It\u2019s like you\u2019re shining.\u201dWas it the lightning in the banquet hall?\u201cNassar, wait here!\u201dLeaving Nassar behind, she went back to the break room and grabbed the hand mirror that was provided. After that, she went out into the hallway and headed to an obscure place. When she reached the dimly lit area, she realized\u2026 Her face didn\u2019t seem to just glow, but it was actually shining.\u201cWhy are you doing this!\u201dPhilomel, holding the hand mirror, shouted.A soft light emanated not only from Philomel\u2019s face, but from her whole body. She didn\u2019t notice it when she was in the brightly lit banquet hall, but when she was in this dimly lit area, she could tell. Strangely, that wasn\u2019t the only thing. When she passed the hallway with the window open, birds came in through the window. Little birds chirped and circled around Philomel. She wanted to get the birds out, so when she went out through the terrace to the garden, something even weirder happened. Wherever Philomel\u2019s feet touched, flowers instantly bloomed. Even in a land where there was no grass, let alone buds!\u201cI\u2019ll be thrilled\u2026\u201dSomeone called out to Philomel, she stopped in her track and looked up from the ground.\u201cThis is it!\u201d\u201cHere you are.\u201dIt was Cardin and Lexion wearing court Mages uniforms. Lexion, who closely observed Philomel\u2019s condition, concluded:\u201cIt\u2019s Le Guin\u2019s work. It\u2019s a multi-complex magic.\u201d\u201cWhy did he do this\u2026\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that what he did for Phil?\u201dCome to think of it, looking at her outfit, she remembered Le Guin, who thought it was too plain.\u201cCan Lexion solve it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s impossible. If I could do that, I would have kicked Le Guin-nim out and become the Mage Tower\u2019s Master.\u201dLexion shook his hand and drove away the noisy birds.\u201cFor now, all I can do is cast my magic over it to scare away the birds. The rest is up to you to finish your errands and go back and ask him to release it.\u201d\u201cOkay. I\u2019m going to go and tell him one or two things.\u201dLexion, who saw Philomel struggling, shook his head. He chased after her, because the light was hard to see in bright places, and the flowers only bloomed on the dirt floor.\u201cGo first. We\u2019ll finish the rest and go.\u201dAfter waving goodbye to the two of them, Philomel returned to the banquet hall. There were many things that came to his mind, but at times like these, the goal in front of her had to be clear. Of course, her goal was to slap Roseanne. Fortunately, Philomel soon found Roseanne, whom she hadn\u2019t seen since that incident. Perhaps with God\u2019s help, Roseanne just so happened to be at the end of a deserted hallway.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even when the posters were damaged and publicized, she tried hard not to take them down. The false rumor that the wicked woman, Philomel, was not really a sinner!\u2018Who would believe that!\u2019Despite believing so, Roseanne\u2019s mood was extremely low. Worse still, she couldn\u2019t find a partner to take her to her Debut. Through the introduction of her cousin, the daughter of the Duchess, Princess Muriel, Roseanne came to get to know some young aristocrats to choose her partner from. But none of them were far enough to satisfy her. After rejecting the partner or being rejected, she ended up here alone. And when she saw that woman standing tall in the banquet hall, Roseanne fumed with rage.The rumors that she had been denying were true. Roseanne was not a criminal herself, but she had beaten a guest of the imperial family. She desperately hid from Philomel after the announcement.The ring she took from that woman was her answer to the question of \u201cHow can I make up for my mistake?\u201dThe red and beautiful ring. It was an enchanting jewel that the more she looked at it, the more she wanted to own it rather than tell it to the imperial family. The ring was currently stored in a jewelry box in her room. She wanted to keep it there, but\u2026Roseanne decided to hold back her greed and give the ring to the new princess. So when her dance was over, she approached the princess. She intended to win her favor with the ring, and to ask for protection from Philomel. For now, she would bring up the topic of the ring first, make an appointment, and hand over the ring later to the Princess. But the reality was not so rosy.The young ladies who had gathered beside the princess fiercely pushed Roseanne away. It was because, as she had tried to squeeze between them, Roseanne stepped on their feet and shoved them on the shoulder. All of them were daughters of high-ranking aristocratic families that were said to have a long-standing relationship with the Imperial family.\u201cOh, this is a face I haven\u2019t seen before. Who is this?\u201d\u201cWhy, the daughter of a local viscount family who is called Mano or Mono\u2026\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s Princess Muriel\u2019s cousin, and she has been chasing after her ever since she came to the capital, poor Princess who had to deal with her.\u201d\u201cI think it would be better for Princess Muril to stay away from her inferior relatives.\u201dThe face of her cousin Sasha Muriel, who was next to Roseanne, turned red.\u201cYou, don\u2019t pretend to know me from now on!\u201dUpon hearing her cousin\u2019s words, Roseanne almost burst into tears with resentment. Why did she have to be treated this way?\u2018They are proud of being born to good parents!\u2018Then the Imperial Princess appeared in front of her like her savior. The Princess looked at Roseanne and softly greeted her.\u201cHello young lady, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cYour Highness the Princess!\u201dRoseanne hurriedly raised the Princess\u2019s hand and squeezed it. Ellencia\u2019s face stiffened for a moment, then returned to normal.\u201cYour Highness, please listen to me.\u201d\u201cDo you have anything you want to tell me?\u201d\u201cThere is a story I want to tell only to Your Highness! It\u2019s a very important story!\u201d\u201cHmm. But what should I do? I have a prior appointment with the other young ladies. You have to follow the order\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have time! Your Highness, please\u2026\u201dEllencia resolutely pushed Roseanne away.\u201cKeep order.\u201dRoseanne looked around her. The ladies who surrounded the Imperial Princess were all descendants of high-ranking aristocratic families. The children of families similar in rank to Roseanne\u2019s family were just watching from a distance. Here, she was a loach that unknowingly muddy her waters. Laughter broke out among them over Rosanne.\u201c\u2026then, excuse me!\u201dShe left as if to run away. Rosanne, who was walking around the dark hallway, shouted.\u201cNo, why should I be shaking like this! What did I do wrong!\u201dRosanne\u2019s shame turned to anger and she headed for Philomel. Even if she was a state guest, in conclusion, she was a commoner. A commoner that Roseanne could trample on! It was all because of Philomel that she suffered this humiliation after all.Just then, the woman she wanted to trample on appeared in front of Roseanne, who was full of hatred.Philomel narrowed her eyes and said in a cold voice.\u201cWe meet again.\u201d\u201cP-Philomel\u2026\u201d\u201cLady Manon, do you have anything to say to me right now? It\u2019s not too late to apologize.\u201c\u201cApologize\u2026 have you gone mad? There\u2019s nothing I need to apologize for, not to you of all people! Do you know what happened to me just because of you?\u201d\u201cWhatever it is that has happened to you, I assume it\u2019s not as bad as getting forcefully imprisoned. Anyway, you said you won\u2019t apologize.\u201dPhilomel held out her hand.\u201cGive me the ring.\u201d\u201cNo! Why do I have to give it to you? It\u2019s the Royal family\u2019s treasure.\u201dAfter hearing that, Philomel withdrew her hand.\u201cAs you wish, it doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t give it to me. I had no intention of having it again. But if you don\u2019t return it to the Imperial Family, I will accuse you of theft.\u201d\u201cWhat theft?!\u201d\u201cHis Majesty the Emperor, had entrusted the ring to me, how can I describe you, who took it away from me forcefully, other than a thief? If you don\u2019t return it by the end of this banquet in five days, I will file a complaint to His Majesty.\u201dPhilomel continued when she saw Roseanne was still holding her head high.\u201cBesides that. How are you going to explain to his Majesty, why you have the ring he had entrusted to me? If he asks me, I\u2019ll have no choice but to tell him the truth. Every single detail.Philomel heavily stressed her last sentence.\u201c\u2026Can I just give you the ring?\u201dIt was humiliating, couldn\u2019t risk enraging his Majesty. If she returned the ring to Philomel, she would no longer have a problem with Roseanne.\u201cI\u2019m glad we could settle this matter, Lady Manon. You have five days to return the ring to me.\u201dA glimmer of hope shone in Roseanne\u2019s heart, however that glimmer of hope shattered at Philomel\u2019s next words.\u201cHowever, returning the ring is one matter and being slapped in the cheek is an entirely different matter. It\u2019s only fair to return the favor\u201dPhilomel smiled as she held her right shoulder in place with the help of her left hand and started to move her right arm in a circle. It was as if Philomel was doing a warm-up before a workout.Roseanne\u2019s expression crumpled mercilessly as she realized what Philomel wanted to do.\u201cWhat did that woman just say! Are you planning on hitting me? How dare you, a commoner, hit me?\u201dIt was a fatal humiliation for Roseanne to get beaten by a commoner. Not even her father, the Viscount, had ever slashed his precious daughter.Philomel chuckled.\u201cThen should I tell everyone what the Viscount\u2019s daughter has done to me, the Empire\u2019s savior?\u201dRoseanne chewed her lips until she bled. She wanted to say that from her heart, but she thought of her family. The family of Viscount Manon just moved to the Capital, this was a very important time. Both her father and older brothers were working hard to establish their family in the Capital. If, at a time like this, the other families turn their backs to them, the pillars of the Viscount\u2019s family would crumble. Besides, if the emperor\u2019s wrath were to be aroused\u2026Roseanne let out a scream-like shout out of desperation.\u201cThis isn\u2019t fair! You\u2019re just lucky!\u201dPhilomel\u2019s eyebrows curled.\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! You were lucky enough to be born at the same time as the Princess and then your mother even swapped you with the Princess, so you lived leisurely as the Imperial Princess!\u201dRoseanne poured out her words like a rapid-fire cannon.\u201cYou were lucky again that the Emperor liked you! I don\u2019t believe what they say about you being the savior of the Empire! The Emperor is trying to cover your sins! I\u2019m sure you did all sorts of tricks to please the Emperor! So? Is it good to live like that by acting cute and flattery-\u201cRoseanne, said any and everything she could think of was suddenly silenced by Philomel\u2019s piercing voice.\u201cYou talk as if you know about me.\u201dPhilomel looked down at Roseanne expressionlessly. Roseanne was taller than her, but she strangely felt smaller in Philomel\u2019s presence.\u201c\u2026\u201dOnly one word from Philomel, and a cold glance, made Roseanne frightened. But she soon felt ashamed of the fact that she was intimidated by a commoner woman like this. Roseanne, overcoming her fear, presented her face to Philomel.\u201cHit me! Try hitting me! Even if you hit me, I\u2019m\u2026\u201dIn an instant, Rosanne\u2019s left cheek felt as if it were on fire, and a great excruciating pain arose. It was the first pain she had ever experienced in her life. Roseanne\u2019s body seemed to float in the air for a moment, then she collapsed onto the floor. Her limbs trembled. It hurted. She was in so much pain that she wanted to cry.* * *Philomel looked down at Roseanne, who had fallen and could not get up. She was secretly worried about her.\u201cDid I hit you too hard\u2026?\u201dIf it caused even irreparable damage, it was a crime without any excuse. Philomel gently touched Roseanne\u2019s face. It didn\u2019t look like her bones were broken, and it didn\u2019t look like her teeth were out.\u00a0 If this was the case, even if Roseanne accused her later, she would be able to get away with saying that she just paid back what she had endured that day.The logic of \u2018an eye for an eye\u2019 was used to some extent in imperial law, so Philomel won\u2019t be in any trouble.Philomel squeezed her right hand, she could still vividly feel the feeling of hitting Roseanne\u2019s cheek. To be honest, it shouldn\u2019t feel good to hit anyone, no matter how much one hated the other person, but it surprisingly felt good. Maybe Philomel didn\u2019t know that this was her own nature. She wondered if the child who would have become the vicious \u2018Philomel\u2019 in the book could have become who she was now thanks to her constant vigilance.\u2018If I don\u2019t want to become a criminal, I have to consciously live a good life\u2026\u2019She thought so, but Philomel\u2019s hand went through Roseanne\u2019s handbag like a thief. However, the ring of red flame was not there. It seemed that Roseanne had not brought the ring to this occasion. Reluctantly, Philomel rose from the floor.\u201cBring the ring back on your own. The deadline is five days. Five days.\u201dPhilomel felt she\u2019s repeating herself way too many times but she had to make sure Roseanne heard her.Leaving the fallen noble girl alone, Philomel left the debutante Ball. She had accomplished her original purpose, so it was time for her to go back and live.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 69": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/There Is No Place For FakesCH 69Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter that day, Philomel rested for three days and it was already the fifth day of the Debutante Ball which lasted for five days. Since there was no reason for Philomel to attend, she enjoyed her leisurely reading, and Le Guin wandered by her side.\u201cPhil?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cAre you still mad?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cCalm down.\u201d\u201cNo, I do not want to.\u201d\u201cIs it because the other day I arbitrarily cast a spell on you?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all because I think of you. I want you to shine.\u201d\u201cIf you really thought of me, you should have followed me.\u201d\u201c\u2026Sorry. I\u2019ll apologize, so relieve your anger.\u201dPhilomel closed the book with a bang. In her view, Le Guin was more apologetic than sincerely feeling sorry for her. But even though he said that, it was a bit odd to keep listening to it. In fact, Philomel wasn\u2019t really mad at him either, she was just pretending to be angry so that it wouldn\u2019t happen again. She actually was a little happy to see him paying attention to her reaction so closely.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to do this again, are you?\u201dPhilomel asked in her temper, and he answered quickly.\u201cNo, I promise!\u201dAnyway, because he spoke well, Philomel smiled involuntarily. And it was the last day of the banquet, the last day of the deadline set by Philomel for Roseanne. In the late afternoon, a tip came in from Nancy. She said she had selected a dress for the banquet this time, so Philomel asked for Roseanne. She told her to let her know when Roseanne was coming. She hasn\u2019t been seen for the past three days, and today she finally came to the banquet .Philomel wondered what Roseanne was up to, and whether or not she would bring the ring. Philomel said that she was not going to attend the banquet formally, but\u00a0 she planned to watch it secretly from afar, so she headed to the banquet hall. If Roseanne gave her the ring, she would just leave, otherwise she would expose her as a thief in front of everyone. To be honest, Philomel didn\u2019t want to accuse Roseanne too much. She wanted to wrap up this quickly, not for Roseanne\u2019s sake but for her own.When the ring case was revealed, attention would be focused not only on Roseanne but also on Philomel. She decided that now she would not cower from attention, but a nuisance is still a nuisance. Philomel deep down hoped that Roseanne would live a righteous life.She arrived at the ballroom late and entered the building through the back door. Naturally, there were no guards standing in her way as she was the former princess and now a prominent guest.Philomel stood in front of one of the less traveled doors, from many, leading to the hall and peered inside. It seemed that the hall was still peaceful without much fuss. Philodel looked for Ellencia with her eyes. Ellencia was the most likely person to whom Roseanne would hand over the ring. If it\u2019s Roseanne, there\u2019s a good chance she\u2019ll try to win Ellencia\u2019s favor and attack Philomel.\u2018 can\u2019t allow that\u2026\u2019If she ever tried to contact Elencia, Philomel planned to expose her first. But among the people gathered around Ellencia, Roseanne was nowhere to be seen. Philomel narrowed her eyes for a while and looked around her. Instead of Roseanne, familiar faces stood out.Lexion was talking with some nobles. Being relatively close to Philomel, she could hear their conversation sparsely.\u201cThe friend I talked about is this friend. She\u2019s very smart, and I want to hire her unless she belongs to the imperial palace.\u201d\u201cIt is overrated. It\u2019s a lack of talent.\u201d\u201cHumility! Let\u2019s talk slowly over a drink later!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s always an honor for me.\u201dNo, when did they become close like that? It\u2019s been a few days since he came here. Lexion, who had been smiling for business, spotted Philomel and gave a slight glance. Philomel also responded with an eye salutation.This time Cardin was in her eyes. Holding a plate piled with food like a mountain, he exclaimed excitedly.\u201cThis is heaven, to give all this delicious food for free!\u201dIt was the first time she had ever seen someone who ate snacks prepared for a light meal like that. It was embarrassing so she pretended not to know him. The nobleman next to Lexion also frowned.\u201cThey\u2019re a low-level young man. He seems also to be a court Mage, do you know each other?\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t know anyone.\u201dLexion, too, turned away from his brother. After that, Philomel, who kept looking inside the hall, finally found Roseanne. She was walking through the hall with her hat slanted over her left cheek as far as possible. At first glance, her left cheek, exposed from under her hat, seemed slightly swollen. Roseanne, who had been looking around her, hid behind the pillar.\u2018What? Did you do anything bad?\u2019Suddenly, Philomel felt Someone hand on her shoulder as she wanted to enter the banquet hall. A voice resonated above her head.\u201cPhilomel.\u201dEustis talked.\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were attending today. But you\u2019re not going in. What are you doing in a place like this?\u201dA startled Philomel took a few steps back and greeted him with perfect courtesy.\u201cGreeting Your Majesty, the sun of the Empire. Have you been well?\u201d\u201c\u2026fine.\u201dThe Emperor\u2019s hand on her shoulder was withdrawn in vain. Philomel was embarrassed.\u2018I didn\u2019t hear that you\u2019d attend today.\u2019As she explained why she had come here, she aroused the Emperor\u2019s suspicion.\u201cI had no intention of attending, but I heard that there was someone here that I wanted to meet, so I stopped by for a while. And your Majesty\u2026?\u201d\u201cI am in a similar situation. I was passing by this area and followed the person I wanted to see as they entered the ballroom.\u201d\u201cOkay. I can continue to wait here, so see Your Majesty around.\u201dThe Emperor continued to be beside Philomel without moving.\u201c\u2026Your Majesty?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be here for a while too.\u201dPhilomel barely swallowed her words. Didn\u2019t he say there was someone he wanted to see? Go away!* * *Roseanne tried to touch her left cheek, but consciously lowered her arm.\u201cChi\u2026 it still hurts.\u201dShe was hit so hard that the area hit was still sore. The red marks on her cheek were covered with makeup, but the swelling did not completely go away.As soon as his daughter appeared with a messed up face at the long-awaited Debutante Ball, the viscount was furious. He pressed Roseanne, asking who the hell did it, but Roseanne couldn\u2019t bear to tell the truth.\u2018Father, wait a moment. I will give the ring to Her Highness the Princess and wash away this humiliation!\u2019As Princess Ellencia, she would naturally hate Philomel, who had taken her place. All she had to do was ignite the anger of the princess inside her. While making such an insidious plan, Roseanne took a close look at the red ring on her palm.Roseanne hid herself behind a pillar, thinking that she should wear the ring one last time. She put on her ring and fiddled with her jewels with her fingertips, tinged with her wistfulness. But, suddenly, the jewel started to glow.* * *Eustis stood side by side with Philomel for a while and talked.\u201cHow are you today?\u201d\u201cI am doing well thanks to Your Majesty\u2019s kindness.\u201d\u201cIs the Southern Palace to your liking?\u201d\u201cIt is very pleasant. All of these are blessings bestowed by His Majesty.\u201d\u201cAre you sick anywhere?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201dPhilomel licked her lips as she remembered what had happened last time. He heard Count Pollan\u2019s strange advice about his relationship with his children, much to Philomel\u2019s dismay. She didn\u2019t know the details, but who was the child that Eustis cares about so much? Ellencia.\u2018If you want to do it, you only do it to Ellencia, why are you doing it to me\u2026?\u2019Because of the Emperor\u2019s presence, it was difficult to see what Roseanne was doing. Did she bring the ring of crimson flames?\u201cBut lately, you haven\u2019t been wearing a ring of red flames.\u201d\u201cYes? The ring?\u201dPhilomel\u2019s heart skipped a beat at the mention of what she was thinking. Perhaps because of her mood, Eustis\u2019 gaze seemed to be directed towards the pillar where Roseanne was hiding.\u201cDid you lose the ring?\u201d\u201cNo. That\u2019s not it\u2026\u201dIt was more like robbery than loss. Apparently, Eustis wanted the treasure of the Imperial Family to be returned.Philomel bowed her head.\u201cSorry. It\u2019s in someone else\u2019s hands. I\u2019ll return it as soon as I can, so please give me some time.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to scold you, I just\u2026\u201d\u00a0 continued Eustis, who nervously brushed his bangs. \u201cAnyway, doesn\u2019t that mean that the ring of red flame is not in your hand right now?\u201d\u201cIt is.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not your will.\u201d\u201cThere were unavoidable circumstances\u2026\u201d\u201cAll right. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll bring you the ring myself.\u201d\u201cYes, yes?\u201dEustis walked into the venue without hesitation. People who danced in pairs in the hall hurriedly lowered their heads at the sudden appearance of the Emperor. For some reason, feeling like she had to follow him, Philomel headed inside. The place where Eustis stopped walking was the pillar where Roseanne was hiding. In an anxious premonition, Philomel measured her feet.Roseanne, who was behind the pillar, looked behind her in bewilderment. Eustis held out his hand to her without saying a word.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was watching the light of the mysterious ring from behind the pillar, but at some point, a commotion broke out in the venue. What the hell was going on? She looked behind her and\u2026Roseanne faced a man with jet-black hair and gasped, taking in her breath. It wasn\u2019t just because she saw the Emperor. Seeing the Emperor up close, he was more beautiful than any man Roseanne had ever met. His black hair and contrasting white face, his well-trained body, deep blue eyes, and even the gloomy dark aura under his eyes made the man\u2019s charm stand out.Roseanne could make a statement. There would be no way to express the Emperor\u2019s beauty in any portrait. Then, seeing the man\u2019s outstretched hand, she pondered over the implied intention. It probably meant to ask for something, but what was it?Soon, along with the answer, the entire process leading up to this situation was easily pictured in her head. There was only one thing the Emperor could want from her. Roseanne raised her hand, wearing the red ring. Her body shuddered with the flood of her explosive emotions. Suddenly, Roseanne\u2019s hand was gently placed on the black gloved hand.The man\u2019s jewel-like blue eyes opened slightly wide. Most of the people present were holding their breath, so she could clearly hear someone whispering.\u201cLook, what the hell is going on?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Suddenly, His Majesty the Emperor appeared and asked the young lady over there to dance.\u201dRoseanne displayed a smile on her face that beamed with confidence.* * *Philomel looked at the scene in horror. When Eustis held out his hand, Roseanne not only refused to give him the ring, but also gave him her hand. For a moment Philomel wondered if she slapped her so hard that Roseanne\u2019s brain was damaged along her cheek.\u201cSuddenly, His Majesty the Emperor appeared and asked the young lady over there to dance.\u201dHearing the whispers of those around him, Philomel ealized their delusion. Yes. Dance music was in full swing in the hall, and men and women were dancing in pairs. In the middle of it, reaching out your hand to the opposite sex was considered as an application to dance.The tumult gradually grew as the unprecedented incident unfolded in front of them.\u201cHis Majesty the Emperor? No way.\u201d\u201cNo. He definitely applied. I saw it with my own two eyes.\u201d\u201cBut His Majesty doesn\u2019t dance.\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t seen him dancing since Her Majesty passed away.\u201d\u201cDoes he like that young lady?\u201d\u201cThen, for His Majesty, the spring day is finally coming\u2026\u201d\u201cIs the seat next to the sun finally filled?Misunderstandings gave birth to new misunderstandings. Before anyone knew it, Roseanne was being talked about as the next Empress. In a normal case, even if the Emperor really asked an unmarried woman to dance, there would not have been such an uproar. But he was Eustis. He was a pathetic man who only danced with his wife.When his wife died, he was the one who hadn\u2019t danced at all, so it wasn\u2019t unreasonable that the request was given great significance. And of course, Roseanne was the most excited about the growing misunderstanding.Roseanne, clutching the Emperor\u2019s hand, tried to lead him into the center of her hall.\u201cMy dance skills are no match for Your Majesty\u2019s, but I\u2019ll do my best to not disappoint you!\u201dIt wasn\u2019t just Roseanne. A middle-aged man with red hair jumped out. Judging from his resemblance to Roseanne, the man was Viscount Marnon.\u201cYour Majesty! I am Viscount Marnon. I just moved to the capital. My daughter is a woman with many shortcomings, but please take good care of her.\u201dViscount Manon pushed the Emperor to go dancing. The thought of becoming the father-in-law of the Emperor seemed to have made him lose his cowardice.\u2018It\u2019s a mess.\u2019Philomel slipped behind him. Considering the Emperor\u2019s disposition, bloody winds could have blown.\u201cWe should stay and not get into trouble in vain together.\u201dPhilomel headed towards the entrance they used to stealthily enter. At that time, Eustis, who had been hardened like a stone statue, moved. After removing Roseanne\u2019s hand, he strode towards Philomel.\u201cYour Majesty, where are you going?\u201d\u201cYour Majesty the Emperor!\u201dRoseanne and Viscount Manon called anxiously, but he did not look back.\u201cPhilomel, I ask you one thing. Is she your friend?\u201d he said before the entrance.That friend meant Roseanne, Philomel rebutted, realizing what he meant.\u201cI swear not!\u201dRather than having a friend like that, she would choose to live without friends for the rest of her life.\u201cOkay. Forget about that Crimson Flame Ring.\u201dAs Philomel looked on incredulously, Eustis took off his glove and threw it away.\u201cIt\u2019s dirty. I\u2019ll make you a new one. And Pollan.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dCount Pollan, who had been there for some time, answered from behind.\u201cDid he say Manon? Dig up and bring all that comes out, regardless of family or relatives.\u201d\u201cI take your order.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s interesting.\u201dA dark smile on his face was far from funny. Philomel expressed her condolences in advance to Viscount Manon and his relatives.* * *Several days have passed since then. Philomel opened the newspaper as she started her morning routine. Even today, the topic that was intensively covered in the newspaper had not changed.[Who is His Majesty\u2019s wife, Lady Roseanne Manon?][Scoop! A conversation with an insider of the Viscount Manon\u2019s family][From the return of Her Highness the princess to the good news, the royal family\u2019s double congratulations][Viscount Manon, it\u2019s too early to discuss national marriage\u2026]Various newspapers in the empire were pouring out articles about the Emperor\u2019s new love story every day. On the day after the banquet, only a few newspapers carried eyewitness accounts of requesting a dance for the newly debuted young lady. However, as there were no gestures in the imperial palace, the number of articles gradually began to increase, and now they poured in indiscriminately. But, since there was too little related information, most of the articles were just fiction.[An attractive young lady who caught the eyes of His Majesty the Emperor, who lived in disappointment.][His Majesty, who had been watching throughout the Debutante Ball, summoned his courage and applied for a dance on the last day.]This and that was said in the articles. Philomel read the articles with piercing eyes. Jeremiah, who was seated across from her, cleared his throat.\u201cDon\u2019t worry too much. He can\u2019t live his whole life honoring his dead wife. You must have a complicated feeling, but that\u2019s how people live.\u201d\u201cJeremiah, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re mistaken about, but I\u2019m not a girl who gets depressed about her dad\u2019s remarriage.\u201dLe Guin agreed.\u201cYes. Besides, that unscrupulous fellow still considers himself to be Phil\u2019s father, so how can he see a girl of his daughter\u2019s age as a woman?\u201d\u201cNot even that.\u201dPhilomel walked to the window and looked out at the scenery outside. She never imagined that just a single ring of hers that had been forcefully taken from her, would make such a mess.\u2018Ah, I don\u2019t know. Let it be.\u2019But now at least Roseanne had nothing to do with Philomel.\u2018Even the Emperor said to forget about the ring, so I can forget about it\u2026\u2019One good thing about this whole mess was that the news of her Emperor\u2019s new lover kept everyone busy, so the gossip about Philomel died down.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 71": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/There Is No Place For FakesCH 71Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayA present arrived at the viscount\u2019s house today. Several families sent gifts to connect with Manon, who might produce a new empress. They were expensive items that would have made Roseanne\u2019s eyes wide open in the past, but now she didn\u2019t even look at them. Viscount Manon spent the money like water and was pleased with his daughter\u2019s future. Her brothers asked Roseanne, playfully, what would she do for them once she became empress? The title they used for Roseanne in the family also became \u2018Our Empress\u2019.Roseanne now stiffened her neck in front of Sasha Muriel. Even her father, who had only been bowing down to Duke Muriel, sighed.Everything was enjoyable. They were experiencing the pinnacle of happiness.That day, Roseanne was invited to a meeting by Marquis Odelli and headed to Marquis Odelli\u2019s residence. The high-end wagon they bought yesterday rode proudly down the road.Roseanne smiled heartily. Now, even the Marquis was impatient to invite her. Many young aristocrats gathered at the meeting hosted by Canny Odelli, a well-known socialite. All of them were children of good families, so it was the best place to make friends. Seeing Roseanne arrive at the meeting place, the other attendees whispered.\u201cThat young lady is that young lady.\u201d\u201cDoes she have a great charm enough to captivate His Majesty?\u201d\u201cShe wears very expensive items.\u201d\u201cI heard His Majesty gave it to her?\u201d\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m stuck on the subject of the country\u2019s nobility.\u201dRoseanne fluttered her silk fan proudly. The delicate butterfly pattern embroidered stitch by stitch by her craftsman was very lively. Because of that, it was so expensive that her eyes popped out even though it was barely a fan.Kenny Odelli greeted her.\u201cHello, Lady Manon. This is your first visit. Do you like the atmosphere here?\u201d\u201cYes, I finally found a meeting that suits my level..Kenny, who had momentarily smirked, was delighted when he saw the man just walking through the door.\u201cNassar, long time no see!\u201dAs always, Nassar Avrydon appeared, stealing the admiration of the surroundings. He was a man reminiscent of a beautiful angel statue. He was also a masterpiece created by a sculptor who gave him life.Roseanne caught her spirit as she tried to daz him momentarily.\u2018I already have a partner, so what am I doing blindly?\u2019And besides that, he was a person with a fiance. But wasn\u2019t he, the best groom in the empire, the man Roseanne was aiming for in the first place? When she saw him, Roseanne suddenly felt sorry for herself. The Emperor was charming enough and the most dignified being, but the flaw was that he had a daughter the same age as Roseanne. He was also close to twice her age. If Roseanne had met Nassar first, rather than the Emperor, would it have been different?Kenny kindly tapped Nassar on the shoulder.\u201cYou\u2019ve been frequenting Angelium lately, and you\u2019re here today.\u201d\u201cUgh. I\u2019m done with my business there.\u201dAt the name Angelium, Roseanne was startled. Her memory of the time she slapped Philomel on the cheek came automatically to her mind. For a moment, she was worried about what would happen if Nassar knew about it.\u2018It\u2019s okay, how could he know that just because he went to Angelium!\u2019Roseanne calmed down and waited for Kenny to introduce her to Nassar.\u201cYou know her, right? This is the famous Lady Roseanne.\u201d\u201cAh. I know her.\u201dSeeing Roseanne, his inside glowed coldly.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Little Duke of Avrydon.\u201dRoseanne held out the back of her hand for him to kiss her. Nassar smiled and took the back of her hand and looked at the fan in that hand.\u201cIt\u2019s Terbeia\u2019s fan.\u201d\u201cOh my God! You know?\u201d\u201cYes. It was popular in the social world at one time.\u201dRoseanne was excited and chatted.\u201cIt\u2019s Terbeia\u2019s new work, which has gone a step further from the popular style. Originally, they wouldn\u2019t sell it to anyone, but when I went to pay them a visit, they said that the fan had found it\u2019s owner.\u201d\u201cIt looks like you\u2019ve confused the words. I meant that it\u2019s similar to Terbeia\u2019s fan.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cTerbeia never embroiders twice the same pattern on an object they have already embroidered. My mother already has a Terbeia fan embroidered with butterflies.\u201dThat meant, this was\u2026Nassar laughed and hammered the nail.\u201cThis is an imitation of Terbeia.\u201dSuppressed sneers erupted from all sides. Roseanne\u2019s face turned red like a tomato. Nassar \u2018undressed\u2019 Roseanne from her head to her toes making her the object of humiliation. It was clearly his act of disrespecting her.\u201cThe fan did a good job finding its owner.\u201dRoseanne hurriedly left the Marquis Odelli\u2019s residence before the entertainment even started.\u201cAaaagh!\u201dAs soon as she climbed into the carriage she threw the fan on the floor of the carriage with a growl. What an angel, Nassar Avrydon was a serpent. A low-tempered and cunning bastard!\u201cYou dare to ignore me, the future Empress? I will definitely tell His Majesty and won\u2019t let you go!\u201dRoseanne, who had no choice but to grind her teeth, shouted at the coachman who was hesitant at her door.\u201cLet\u2019s go to the boutique street right away! This time, make sure to go to a place that only deals with genuine products!\u201dWhen she arrived at the capital\u2019s first boutique street, Roseanne swept through the shops one after another. And she bought all of her luxurious-looking products. Anything that would suit an Empress!Even the store, which originally did not allow credit, recognized Roseanne and promised to send the goods to the mansion. The payment was put in front of the viscount\u2019s family. Her father would grab her by the scruff of her neck, but it didn\u2019t matter. Viscount Manon would make his daughter feel better no matter what. In her mind, she wanted to claim it as the imperial palace, but she didn\u2019t have the right to do so because she wasn\u2019t the Empress yet. The coachman asked Roseanne from the last shop.\u201cMy lady, where are you going next?\u201dRoseanne answered without hesitation.\u201cLet\u2019s go to the imperial palace.\u201dThe carriage started moving. She intended to wait patiently until they called her, but Roseanne\u2019s patience ran out. And there was that woman in the imperial palace. Philomel, who dared to slap her cheek, that woman. It\u2019s really disgusting to see her living in the imperial palace that would become Roseanne\u2019s home.\u2018I\u2019ll kick you out.\u2019When she arrived at the imperial palace, Roseanne noticed something and stopped. It was because a series of young ladies were entering the Imperial Palace one after another.Then Roseanne suddenly remembered. Today was the day of Princess Ellencia\u2019s first tea party. She had a memory of knowing about all the ladies of powerful families being invited, and she was very angry since she didn\u2019t receive any invitation.\u201cOoh.\u201dRoseanne\u2019s eyes lit up. She didn\u2019t know if it was a revelation from God that she came to the imperial palace today of all days.\u2018You can\u2019t make a tea party that ignores me\u2026\u2019On the first day of the ball, she distinctly remembered the princess, who looked down on her coldly and shunned her. She didn\u2019t say anything then, but things are different now. Anyway, she was the one who would be her adoptive daughter if Roseanne became Empress. At this point, it\u2019s better to be sure to break the flag. Roseanne changed her destination from the Emperor\u2019s palace to the west palace, where the princess was staying.* * *In the West Palace\u2019s Garden, the Princess\u2019s outdoor tea party had just begun. The tea and food were great and the weather was nice. The flower decorations that decorated the table were luxurious. The other young ladies were happily chatting with the princess. But Melinda, from the County of Lusan, felt uncomfortable inside. Princess Ellencia, who was sitting right to her left, kindly asked.\u201cDoesn\u2019t the tea suit your taste?\u201d\u201cOh, no! The taste and smell are very good!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fortunate. I was worried that I might cause inconvenience to you because I\u2019m not used to such luxurious things.\u201dSeveral young ladies scrambled to deny it.\u201cNo, Your Highness, it is a wonderful tea party.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s the best tea party I\u2019ve ever been to\u2026\u201dSo, Melinda was uncomfortable with this atmosphere. Not too long ago, they said something similar at Princess Philomel\u2019s tea party. But now they\u2019re talking bad about her in front of Princess Ellencia.\u201cTo be honest, Miss Philomel was too frugal. Flowers blooming in the garden are enough.\u201d\u201cYes, I don\u2019t usually hold tea parties.\u201dAlthough her skillful conduct was the basic qualifications of an aristocrat, it felt too disrespectful to Melinda. Even though Philomel wasn\u2019t a Princess anymore, Melinda still liked her and saw her as her role model. But Princess Ellencia\u2026\u201cDon\u2019t be so mean. Philomel is a good person.\u201dOutwardly, she pretended to stop them, but she didn\u2019t look displeased at all. In fact, that attitude of the Princess fueled the coy gossip of the young ladies.When Melinda first saw Princess Ellencia, she thought that the Princess seemed to be an easy-going and kind person. But she was not sure now. Perhaps she wasn\u2019t the only one who felt that way since, except for a few of the ladies, the expressions on most of the guests were very awkward. However, they couldn\u2019t show any discomfort in front of the Princess, so they just laughed. The precarious atmosphere soon broke.\u201cHow are you guys!\u201dIt was because one uninvited person broke in. These days, it was Roseanne Manon, a woman who was more rumored than the newly appeared princess.\u201cLady! You can\u2019t go in without an invitation!\u201d\u201cCome out quickly!\u201dThe maids tried to drag Roseanne out, but she dared them to lay a finger in her and they\u2019ll see the rage of His Majesty, so the maids were at a loss. It was also because she did not yet have a lady-in-waiting to guide her.\u201cRo, Roseanne!\u201dSeeing Roseanne, Sasha Muriel, who was sitting in her seat, turned white.\u201cAre you crazy! Why are you here?\u201dRoseanne lifted her chin.\u201cWhy did I come to a place where I wasn\u2019t invited? More than that, did you ask me if I\u2019m crazy?\u201d\u201cOh, no, that\u2019s not it\u2026\u201d\u201cThinking about the future, you\u2019d better be careful with your mouth. There\u2019s a limit to how many times I can look away because you\u2019re a relative.\u201dThe young ladies narrowed their eyes.\u201cHow can someone be so rude\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cLady Manon, you\u2019re in front of Her Highness the Princess. Be polite!\u201dBut beyond that, she couldn\u2019t utter harsh words. It was because they were all somewhat afraid of Roseanne, who might become the Empress. Princess Ellencia held up the teacup without being shaken.\u201cLady Manon, I know that it is rude to attend a festivity without an invitation, even though my knowledge of etiquette is lacking.\u201dRoseanne put her chin on her hand, and her other hand thumped violently on the table.\u201cWe\u2019ll be seeing each other often, so please treat this level of rudeness as cuteness, Your Highness the Princess.\u201dTheir gazes collided in midair.\u201cI\u2019m not sure what you mean. I don\u2019t want to see the young lady often.\u201d\u201cOh! I feel sad because I want to see Her Highness often\u2026\u201dRoseanne stressed one syllable after another.\u201c\u2026like a family.\u201dThe Princess\u2019s smile wavered. It was only visible to Melinda, who was sitting right next to her. The ripples in the tea water in Ellencia\u2019s teacup,to be precise, Ellencia\u2019s hand holding the teacup was trembling.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was because the mood was broken. Roseanne smiled triumphantly and disappeared somewhere. When she looked in that direction, she seemed to be going towards the Emperor\u2019s Palace.Like that, the Princess\u2019s first tea party ended in disarray as soon as it started.\u201cShall I go for a walk?\u201dMelinda decided not to go back immediately, but to take a short walk. Even though she only took one bite of the sandwich, she felt like it was on her stomach. Unbeknownst to her, her steps headed toward the southern palace. It was said that Miss Philomel was currently residing there.\u201cShe won\u2019t meet me. She was so nice to me, but I didn\u2019t even greet her properly the last time I saw her\u2026\u201dMelinda\u2019s eyes met Philomell\u2019s as she passed by at\u00a0 the debutante Ball. She seemed like a chimney with a willingness to come over and talk, but she only lowered her head in the eyes of others. Recently, most nobles were estimating Philomel\u2019s position. She was a fake princess, but now a state guest, her position was unprecedented and so ambiguous that they were not convinced.If they were close friends now, would there be no regrets later? The situation of Melinda\u2019s father, Count Lusan, was no different. While feeling grateful towards the former princess for helping her wife treat her illness, the Count warned his daughter to watch over the situation for the time being. It was an environment in which the aristocratic hierarchy was impossible to foresee. Didn\u2019t the Elos family, which had no shame, collapse overnight?But then, as Melinda trudged along the road toward the southern palace without much expectation, the person she wanted to see appeared in front of her.\u201cAll you do is hit and run? I won\u2019t talk to Le Guin until he apologizes properly.\u201dThat person was scolding a cat.\u201cMiss Philomel?\u201dThen Philomel turned to Melinda.\u201cUh.\u201dIt was a voice.\u201cLady Lusan!\u201dShe smiled brightly.* * *Philomel invited Melinda to have tea at the southern palace. Contrary to Melinda\u2019s worries, she welcomed her without showing any signs of disgust.Philomel said shyly as she looked down at the simple refreshment table.\u201cIt\u2019s rushed, so it\u2019s nothing special.\u201d\u201cNo! It\u2019s so delicious!\u201dMelinda waved her hand. She wasn\u2019t telling lies, it was really good. The expensive desserts at Princess Ellencia\u2019s tea party tasted like chewy sand, but the one she was eating just melted in her mouth. And the tea was brewed by Miss Philomel herself! When she asked whether or not she had a maid, Philomel replied that she would like to do something simple in the future. And she looked somehow amazing. The feeling of indigestion disappeared in an instant.\u2018As expected, spending time with the person you like is comfortable\u2026\u2019 Looking at Philomel\u2019s unreserved attitude, Melinda became even more ashamed of herself. Trying to alienate someone. \u2018I won\u2019t do that from now on!\u2019She vowed never to repeat that mistake again. She thought that she wanted to get along with Philomel. She\u2019s sure if she convinces him well, her father would understand. Basically, he was a warm-hearted person.\u2018Let\u2019s convince the other young ladies later.\u2019Melinda thought, thinking of several young ladies who still liked the former Princess Philomel. It was then when Melinda\u2019s eyes caught the sight of a cat lying on the grass.\u201cCome to think of it, I didn\u2019t know Miss philomel had a cat.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah, well. That\u2019s it.\u201dPhilomel answered with a puzzled expression for some reason.\u201cWe also have two cats in our house. They are really cute. I\u2019d like to show them to Miss Philomel if I can.\u201dMelinda didn\u2019t care about why Philomel looked puzzled. She was glad to find a common topic among themselves, and her eyes twinkled.\u201cThen, can I visit the Lusan Mansion?\u201d\u201cOh my God! Really? You would?\u201d\u201cOnly if the lady Lusan\u2019s family is okay with it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay! Even if it\u2019s not okay, I\u2019ll make it okay!\u201dSeeing Melinda so happy, Philomel laughed.\u201cIt must come formally later! You promised!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll send you an invitation!\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dMelinda was euphoric. Her cats didn\u2019t have a belly button like Philomel\u2019s but\u2026\u201cBy the way, what\u2019s the name of Miss Philomel\u2019s cat? Didn\u2019t you say something about Guin\u2026?\u201dSuddenly, Philomel\u2019s expression darkened slightly.\u201c?\u201d\u201cGuin-Guin!\u201dAt that strange name, Melinda tilted her head.\u2018\u2026?\u2019For some reason, the cat\u2019s gaze at Philomel seemed not to be nice. But Melinda was delighted that she had discovered a new side of her.\u2018I thought you were perfect, but your sense of naming is lacking\u2026\u2019After all, people can\u2019t excel in everything! That kind of thing just felt kind of cute. Melinda continued to ask questions she had always wondered about Philomel. She wanted to know more about her.\u201cDoes Miss Philomel respect Kwon to the point of using honorifics with him?\u201d\u201c\u2026I usually use honorifics for cats.\u201d\u201cI see. But why were you scolding Kwon so much earlier?\u201d\u201cHe had a bit of an accident.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of accident?\u201d\u201cHe broke the pottery in the room.\u201d\u201cMy cat has been like that a lot. We can\u2019t keep anything at home with him in the same room.\u201dPhilomel said playfully.\u201cUgh. Kwon has been having a lot of accidents lately. He\u2019s making a lot of noise, and he keeps hitting things.\u201dMelinda wanted to be of some help to Philomel, so she said out of the blue.\u201cIsn\u2019t that a symptom of heat?\u201d\u201c\u2026yes?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because Kwon is in heat, yup!\u201dPhilomel hurriedly rose from her seat and covered Melinda\u2019s mouth.\u201cIt would be better to not say anything further than that, Lady Lusan.\u201d* * *After Melinda, who was enjoying tea time, went back to her mansion, the common room was again occupied by Philomel, her three brothers and their father.\u201cHa ha ha! It\u2019s time of heat! Heat! Oh, is our Guin-Guin in heat?\u201dCardin laughed as he folded his waist.\u201c\u2026\u201dAfter a while, he was tied up and hung upside down from a tree.\u201cOops! I was wrong! Put me down! Blood is rushing to my head. Ugg!\u201dPhilomel looked at Jeremiah rebukingly. He was the culprit who fooled Lexion and Cardin about what Melinda said.\u201cAnyway\u2026 kuh, from now on\u2026 it\u2019s better to be careful\u2026 if that young lady\u2026 heard something important\u2026 It must have been annoying.\u201dBeside her, Lexion barely suppressed his laugh and spoke. When Le Guin glared at him, he shrugged.Philomel put her question, which she had already asked, into her mouth once more.\u201cLe Guin, are you really not going to touch Melinda?\u201d\u201cNo, since there was no malice.\u201dWhile talking today, Philomel and Melinda decided to call each other by their first names. Melinda said it was an honor and she rejoiced several times.\u201cI said no. Do I look like such a bad guy to you?\u201dThe same definite answer came back from Le Guin several times. Only then did Philomel, a little relieved, get up from her seat.\u201cThen I\u2019ll go somewhere.\u201d\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u201cSomeone broke a national treasure and I\u2019m going to apologize to the Emperor.\u201dShe had to report to Eustis about the broken pottery because of Le Guin. Anyway, why was that a national treasure?\u201cI\u2019ll give you the reimbursement for it\u2026?\u201dLe Guin suggested, but it sounded more like a question.\u201cNo, there is no need. Rather, they would be suspicious about where the money came from. It\u2019s my guess, but\u2026 He probably won\u2019t make a big deal out of this.\u201dPhilomel spat out words of refusal and turned around. And she walked to the front of the Emperor\u2019s palace. However, a strange sight was unfolding in front of the Emperor\u2019s Palace. Roseanne, caught by the guardsmen, was shouting.\u201cWhere do you put your hands on my body! Do you know who I am? I know you all and I won\u2019t let you go later!\u201dIt seemed that she had been stopped for trying to enter the imperial palace without permission. Philomel leisurely passed her. One of the guards who saw Philomel greeted her.\u201cHello Miss Philomel!\u201d\u201cYou are suffering quite a lot.\u201d\u201cNo! This is our job. Come on in.\u201dA desperate scream erupted from behind Philomel as she entered the palace.\u201cWhy are you blocking me and letting her in!\u201dIt\u2019s really good too. From Philomel\u2019s point of view, Roseanne and her family were eagerly running towards the abyss of ruin. What Roseanne was doing was so famous that it was hard not to hear about it. Philomel shook her head.\u2018At least until you fall, enjoy that happiness to the fullest.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since it\u2019s just a tea party, let it be held again. Don\u2019t worry. She\u2019ll pay dearly for upsetting you.\u201d\u201cI want you to get her out of my sight right now! And why did you ask her to dance?\u201d\u201cLike I said several times; I didn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know! I\u2019m so sorry for my dad!\u201dSuddenly, the door opened. Philomel met Ellencia\u2019s eyes as she left Eustis\u2019 office.\u201c\u2026Greetings Your Highness the Princess.\u201dPhilomel was taken aback, but didn\u2019t show it and greeted Ellencia. However, unlike usual, Ellencia glanced past Philomel without saying anything. Her face was full of anger as she passed by.Philomel stepped into Eustis\u2019 office. The Emperor, who was sitting at the desk, somehow looked a little tired.\u201cWelcome. Do you have something to do with me?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2026 Unfortunately, I accidentally broke the national treasure-level pottery in the State Guest House.\u201dPhilomel spoke her words cautiously.\u201cWhich porcelain?\u201d\u201cA gift from Elita, a porcelain with His Majesty\u2019s face drawn on the surface.\u201dAs expected, Eustis didn\u2019t seem to mind at all.\u201cAh, that\u2019s okay. I didn\u2019t want to see it, so I intentionally left it in the southern palace.\u201d\u201cIs there any particular reason you don\u2019t want to see it?\u201d\u201cI hate my face.\u201dWhy did he hate that handsome face? Well, in any case, it wasn\u2019t a problem for Philomel to worry about.\u201cThank you for your generosity.\u201dPhilomel reported the matter she came for, so she was about to leave when Eustis called for her.\u201cWait a moment.\u201dEustis called Philomel over and pulled a wad of paper from his desk drawer.\u201cJust in time, you have business. Come and see this.\u201d\u201c\u2026yes, yes.\u201dPhilomel looked at him bewildered and took the papers from him. Looking closely, it was a property list. The capital\u2019s mansion, villas located in each province, mines, gold bars, land, and art were listed.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s yours.\u201d\u201cIs it mine?\u201d\u201cYes. You can leave the management to someone else, but it would be better for you to familiarize yourself roughly with what is there.\u201dphilomel, who understood the meaning after a while, exclaimed in surprise.\u201cI can\u2019t take it! How much is all this!\u201d\u201cIt is not given without reason. Aren\u2019t you the benefactor who brought Ellencia back to me? What you did is of great importance, and shouldn\u2019t be looked down upon.\u201dNo matter how the Emperor\u2019s daughter was found, this scale of rewards is still too much. Besides, Philomel was certain that everyone would point fingers at her when it became known that she was inheriting so much.\u201cAbove all, isn\u2019t this the property of the imperial family? Please give it to other people rather than me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my private property.\u201dLooking closely at the list, it seemed like that too. Philomel resolutely set the wad of paper down on the desk. Even if this was a worthy reward for a benefactor who found the Emperor\u2019s daughter, she did not deserve it. Philomel did not bring Ellencia with good intentions. Anyway, she just thought that if Ellencia appeared earlier than in the book, it would create an environment where it was easy for Philomel to escape by controlling the timing and form.\u2018If it was really with good intentions, I would have shown <Princess Ellencia> to this person at the age of nine and informed him of the existence of his biological daughter\u2026\u2019Therefore, this was too much of an award. If she accepted it, it would be a burden on Philomel\u2019s heart for the rest of her life. Maybe she couldn\u2019t leave if Eustis told her not to leave. Philomel decided that she would not accept the Emperor\u2019s gift. That she would not accept, she intended to declare it proudly. She was sure she was going to say\u2026Philomel\u2019s hand held the pen on the desk against her will. After seriously thinking through the list, she scribbled out a few items with her pen. Then she showed the result to the Emperor.\u201cThere are too many others\u2026 Shall I take only this?\u201dYes. It was a gift too precious to just refuse. Eustis looked over the list and took the pen from Philomel\u2019s hand. He marked beside several of the items that were hanging down.\u201cIt\u2019s too little, so take at least this much.\u201d\u201cNo, no, this is too much. Especially never these. Oh, this one too.\u201dPhilomel again snatched the pen from Eustis and marked the middle item.\u201cNo. I can never take this off.\u201dThis time, Eustis took the pen again.\u201cYou really can\u2019t.\u201dThe pen passed again into Philomel\u2019s hand.\u201cWhat are you going to do with just that?\u201dThen it returned to Eustis.For a long time, the two of them exchanged pens and finally found a compromise. Philomel read the list and couldn\u2019t help the twitch as she tried to go up.\u2018I\u2019m already rich with this! From now on, even if I don\u2019t work, I can play, eat, and live comfortably for the rest of my life!Even if she did not work at all in the future, she had enough wealth to play, eat and live comfortably for the rest of her life. It was too much money for her to ignore.The Emperor disapproved until the end, but when Philomel insisted, he gave way to her wishes.\u2018With this amount, I can protect my conscience and gain wealth!\u2019Philomel sighed in delight. In this case, it was helpful that her conscience was not too firm. Didn\u2019t she gain, after all, a great fortune thanks to a little compromise with her conscience? Philomel looked over the rest of the papers Eustis had given her with proud eyes. It was a document with detailed descriptions of each asset.\u201cUh?\u201dHowever, the hand that was handing over the papers stopped. A piece of disparate paper was sandwiched between the documents. It was now that she started with the words \u2018Dear Father\u2019. It was the letter she had left to Eustis before running away.\u201cWhy is this here?\u201dJudging by the remaining crumpled marks, it seemed that the letter was once crumpled and then straightened again by being pressed against something hard.\u201cCome here.\u201dAt that moment, the Emperor reached out and took away the letter Philomel was holding. A look of bewilderment was evident on his face.\u201cLooks like it\u2019s mixed in the stack of papers. Never mind.\u201dPhilomel asked in a slightly hushed voice.\u201cWhy do you still have it?? Just tear it up.\u201dPhilomel was embarrassed by the very existence of the letter. There were also points where she wrote lies that she did not even have in her heart, such as saying that she would help the Empire and repay his favor. She wanted to erase it.\u2018What am I saying?\u2019Hey, a person would live happily ever after with his real daughter. Isn\u2019t that already a great help to the Empire?Eustis paused for a moment before answering Philomel\u2019s question.\u201cBut isn\u2019t this the first letter you wrote to me?Philomel blinked her eyes.\u201cHuh? Is it?\u201dAfter all, until she ran away, they were seeing each other at least once or twice a week, and she didn\u2019t have to send a letter. Awkwardness hung in the air. It\u2019s the first letter she wrote, so he\u2019s keeping it, it\u2019s like\u2026Eustis fixed her gaze on Philomel. It looked like he had made a big decision.\u201cPhilomel, I have a confession to make to you.\u201d he spoke with difficulty. \u201cI should have said it right away, but I was too scared to do it. Actually, I\u2026\u201dBang bang bang!Words were cut off by a loud knock on the door.\u201cDaddy, daddy!\u201dIt was Ellencia\u2019s voice.\u201cDad! I\u2019m sorry I was rude earlier. I\u2019m here to apologize!\u201dEustis let out a weak sigh and looked at Philomel. And she nodded his head in agreement. She didn\u2019t know what he was trying to say, but it didn\u2019t seem like it would come out of this atmosphere.\u201cCome in.\u201dWhen permission was given, the door opened and Ellencia stuck her head out.\u201cI knocked as my father said. Did I do well?\u201dSeeing Philomel, Ellencia said \u201cWhat?\u201d and tilted her head.\u201cPhilomel, you\u2019re still here.\u201d\u201cYes. Our meeting has become longer than I thought. Since it has just ended, I will leave, Your Majesty\u2026\u201dPhilomel greeted Eustis.\u201c\u2026okay. See you later.\u201dThe Emperor accepted the greeting with a face that seemed to have a lot to say.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her reputation was restored to some extent and she became rich. It was hard to say that neither of them lacked the virtues of the Emperor. Maybe Eustis liked her more than she thought.\u201cIs the effort worthwhile?\u201dHowever, she had no idea what the \u2018confession\u2019 Eustis was talking about earlier was. At that time, a tearing shout woke Philomel from her troubles.\u201cWhy won\u2019t you let me in! I said I want to see your Majesty!\u201dShe felt that she had seen Roseanne even before entering. She was still screaming at the captain of the guards with full spirits. The captain of the guards was perplexed and said.\u201cSo\u2026 Whoa. How many times have I explained to you? The Emperor is not someone you can meet just because he invited you to dance once.\u201d\u201cTell His Majesty that Roseanne has arrived! Then he\u2019ll see me!\u201dPhilomel looked at Roseanne with tired eyes.\u201cYou were still holding out here\u2026\u201dIt was great persistence.\u201cYou!\u201dRoseanne, who suddenly spotted Philomel, glared at her.\u201cAre you teasing me? Why do you keep going in and out of here?\u201d\u201cThen where do you go back and forth after leaving the front door?\u201d\u201cYou can look down on me now, but\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re taller than me. How can I look down at you? I\u2019ll look up.\u201dWhen Philomel didn\u2019t say a word, Roseanne wheezed loudly.\u201cEven though your personality is not good, you must have had a lot of trouble pretending to be a benevolent Princess. Does His Majesty know your true nature?\u201dIn fact\u2026 that was what Philomel herself felt. Her nature, which had been suppressed by pretending to be a good child, had recently been waking up. She didn\u2019t know if that\u2019s because she\u2019s no longer the Princess, or if it\u2019s because she\u2019s hanging out with four rich people who make fun of each other every day.\u2018Anyway then.\u2019Philomel raised her finger and patted her on the forehead with her inconsiderate expression.\u201cHey, Lady Manon, if you have a brain, how about you try using it?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhy would His Majesty meet you? Why didn\u2019t he dance with you back then? Why hasn\u2019t he contacted you ever since?\u201dIt was an explanation that even a child could understand at once, but Roseanne jerked her head.\u201cThat\u2019s because His Majesty is a shy person!\u201d\u201cShy?\u201d\u201cThe reason why he left without dancing at the ballroom must have been embarrassing because everyone\u2019s attention was focused on him all of a sudden!\u201dWhose story was she talking about? Philomel even wondered if there was another Emperor in this country other than Eustis. The expressions on the faces of the Imperial Guards next to Philomel were also speechless. She shook her head as she realized that the illusion Roseanne was living under could not be broken by a word or two of hers.\u201cThat\u2019s enough. Stop talking.\u201d\u201cSo arrogant! Wait and see. When I become Empress, I will kill you early!\u201d\u201cHow are you going to do it? Shall we recreate what happened on the debut date?\u201dRosanne\u2019s complexion turned blue as Philomel waved her hand. Her body trembled like an aspen tree in fear of the imprinted slap. When Roseanne reacted that way, Philomel felt like a real gangster herself.\u2018I\u2019m an ideal pacifist where the other side doesn\u2019t use force first\u2026\u2019However, as if nothing was as instantaneous as her power, Roseanne finally turned her steps.\u201cHow long do you think you can be so confident? Wait for my world to come even tomorrow!\u201dEven after all that bullshit, and although Roseanne finished the discussion by running away and curling up her tail, contrary to the assurance, the misfortune of Roseanne and Viscount Manon began the next day.* * *Early in the morning, Viscount Manon entered Roseanne\u2019s room in a huff.\u201cRosanne! Trouble! Trouble\u201dRoseanne, who was still sleepy, replied angrily.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cWell! The inspectors have come to our house now!\u201d\u201cWhy the investigators?\u201d\u201cOur family is said to have committed tax evasion! They say there was something illegal in the process of purchasing this mansion! And again\u2026 Anyway, there are a lot of things!\u201dRoseanne\u2019s eyes flashed open.\u201cDid you really commit tax evasion?\u201dThe Viscount Manon stuttered her.\u201cThat\u2019s true, but\u2026 Eh, anyone commits something illegal like this! Is there any reason not to say that our family, who will soon become the in-laws of the Imperial Family!\u201dIt was. Aside from Viscount Manon\u2019s faults, it was blatantly disrespectful to hold the Empress\u2019s family guilty.An indignant Roseanne stormed out of her room. Investigators were going through the whole mansion, including Viscount Manon\u2019s office. In the Viscount\u2019s office, Roseanne blocked an investigator who was taking a pile of her papers to the courthouse.\u201cWhat kind of safety is this here, where are you going wild!\u201dTo her scolding with the dignity of an Empress to the fullest, the inspector answered indifferently.\u201cThis is an order from His Majesty the Emperor. If you interfere, I will charge you with obstruction of justice.\u201d\u201cWhat, what! His Majesty wouldn\u2019t do that!\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t help it even if you don\u2019t believe it.\u201dThen he passed Roseanne and went away. The other investigators were equally cocky. They all did their job, regardless of Roseanne\u2019s scolding or yelling or using her body. When the investigators left after collecting the evidence, only the ruined mansion remained. Rumors that the Viscount family was under intense scrutiny for illegal activities quickly spread throughout the capital. If Roseanne was really meant to be Empress, she couldn\u2019t be. Then it was the debtors\u2019 turn. Foreseeing the fall of the Viscount, they flocked to the mansion.\u201cWhen are you going to pay back the 100,000 gold you borrowed!\u201d\u201cGive me my money!\u201dAmong the excited creditors, Viscount Manon was sweating.\u201cHoney! Why are you doing this! If my daughter becomes the Empress, she will pay it back!\u201d\u201cThe Empress is a freak!\u201d\u201cYou haven\u2019t paid it back with that excuse yet!\u201dThe Viscount had not poured all the money he had in order to purchase a mansion in the capital, but had borrowed money using the estate as collateral. If the debt stopped there, it would have been over if he handed over the estate. However, he borrowed additional money from acquaintances to satisfy his daughter\u2019s vanity. They believed only the news of Roseanne in the newspaper and lent the Viscount a considerable sum. And eventually, Viscount Manon layed down.\u201cAh! That\u2019s because it\u2019s not there now! If you want to get it, take it yourself!\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t have money, let\u2019s search the house and get something worthwhile!\u201dAt someone\u2019s cry, the creditors trampled on Viscount Manon and burst into the mansion. All the expensive-looking items in the Viscount\u2019s house disappeared. Roseanne\u2019s older brothers asked for help from the Capital guards, but the guards who were dispatched went back after doing only a performance, such as stopping the debtors.Viscountess Manon fainted from shock.Merchants filled the gaps left by creditors. It was the merchants of the boutique shop that Roseanne had been buying her goods from just yesterday. They camped in front of the mansion and clamored for payment. The members of the family could not go out recklessly as they watched with their eyes wide open.Finally, the servants of the mansion went on strike.\u201cIt\u2019s already been three months since my salary was overdue!\u201d\u201cMy children are starving at home!\u201dIt was the fault of Viscount Manon, who didn\u2019t even pay the servants in order to save money.\u201dEverything in the house was paralyzed, and Roseanne\u2019s family couldn\u2019t even get a proper meal. As much as they were aware of the family situation, the servants ran away with the emergency money and jewelry hidden by the Manon family. The whole house was a mess.Viscount Manon, almost crying, said to her daughter.\u201cDaughter! Go to His Majesty immediately. There must be something wrong! Go to the Imperial Palace and tell His Majesty the humiliation we suffered!\u201dRoseanne put on the best one of her leftover dresses, and she took the two of her maids who had been left in her house and got into her carriage. She sneaked out through her back door, but her creditors and her merchants recognized her.\u201cThere!\u201d\u201cRoseanne got into the carriage!\u201dRoseanne urged her coachman.\u201cHurry up! Hurry up!\u201dThe coachman who remained in the mansion for similar reasons to her maids drove the horses. Until then there was still hope for Roseanne. She had no hope that everything would be resolved if she only met the Emperor.\u2018This can\u2019t be! I will definitely become an Empress! Because I am a special person!\u2019She was sure of it from a young age. She was different from others. So, when the Emperor asked her to dance, she had no doubts about her future to rise to that high position.Eventually, the carriage arrived at the imperial palace.Recalling the pursuers who were relentlessly following her carriage, Roseanne entered the imperial palace as if running. The problem arose when she tried to enter the inner palace without an invitation.\u201cNo. Go back.\u201d\u201cOh, the other day she was so confident that she would be the next Empress that she went inside like a storm. We were the only ones who hit the bell.\u201dUnlike yesterday, the gatekeepers of the Inner Palace, who kept her attention, did not let Roseanne in. However, the sky did not completely abandon Roseanne.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dThe Emperor himself appeared in front of Roseanne.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was on her way out to return a book she had borrowed from the Imperial Library. However, the area around on the way from her outer palace to the inner palace was noisy. She got curious and went closer, and there were many people who didn\u2019t look like courtiers.\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Philomel asked her former maid, who was also there.\u201cHello, Miss Philomel. The Emperor is now meeting face to face with Lady Manon.\u201dReally? Has Roseanne\u2019s obsession finally paid off?\u201cWhat are all these people up to?\u201d\u201cThey are pleading in front of the Imperial Palace that they have to receive payment from the Viscount and the young lady. His Majesty the Emperor heard the news and ordered them all to be brought\u2026\u201dPhilomel already knew where this was going. The creditors of the Viscount Manon\u2019s family came all the way to the Imperial Palace to collect their money. Even Philomel had heard the rumors that the Manon family was on the verge of bankruptcy because of their lavish spending. They must be very desperate too. It was not unreasonable that they flocked to the Emperor, who was considered the only person who could pay them. If the Emperor had any intention of making Roseanne his Empress, or at least his lover, he would pay her debts.Curious, Philomel stepped further into the crowd.The Emperor and Roseanne were in the middle, and people surrounded them in a circle. Falling on the floor, Roseanne begged the Emperor.\u201cYour Majesty, please take care of me and my family. Those insolent men harass me. I beg you to punish them and protect me.\u201dUnheard of, a man bravely stepped before the Emperor.\u201cYour Majesty the Emperor!\u201dThe man briefly introduced himself and stated his business.\u201cI lent 100,000 golds to Viscount Manon and haven\u2019t gotten them back yet! It\u2019s already been a while since the repayment date expired. Please don\u2019t believe that woman\u2019s words. We are the victims.\u201dThen the Emperor looked around at the crowd.\u201cAnything else. If you have anything to say to the Emperor about this woman and her family, do it right here and now.\u201dAs if they had made up their minds, the debtors opened their mouths one by one.\u201cI run a small boutique, and the young lady bought 30,000 golds worth of goods yesterday and they didn\u2019t pay for them.\u201dRosanne shouted.\u201cNo. I just bought it on credit!\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t want to sell it on credit, but the young lady threatened me that she wouldn\u2019t let me go if I didn\u2019t sell it\u2026\u201dThe accusations continued.\u201cIt was like that at our store too!\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t received a total of 140,000 golds yet!\u201dThe maids next to Roseanne also bowed down and pleaded.\u201cThe salaries of the servants working in the mansion have been delayed for a long time. Although, the Manon family enjoyed luxury!\u201d\u201cNot only that. Lady Manon insulted us severely and even beat us if we made even the slightest mistake!\u201dAt first, the theme was the money that was not received, but gradually, the evil deeds of Roseanne and her family came out. A man who seemed to be the coachman of the poor Viscount also stepped forward.\u201cThe Viscount hit me, saying it was my neglect that the sick and old horse died! He didn\u2019t even pay for the medicine. I had to lie down for a week!\u201dAccording to the testimony of the maid of the West Palace, it was also revealed that Roseanne had been messing around at Ellencia\u2019s tea party the other day. People couldn\u2019t hide their surprise at Roseanne\u2019s rude actions even toward the Princess. And coincidentally, Philomel was right next to the maid in the West Palace. Since the accusations continued sideways from a certain moment, people\u2019s eyes naturally focused on Philomel. And of course Roseanne knew that Philomel had something to say about her.\u2018I just came to see\u2026\u2019As she listened, more people flocked to it and she couldn\u2019t get out. But that wasn\u2019t the mood to be honest. Come to think of it, Roseanne hadn\u2019t returned the ring of red flames yet.She gave a glance as if asking Eustis if she could talk. Eventually Philomel raised her hand.\u201cLady Manon robbed me of the Red Flame ring, a treasure of the Imperial Family.\u201dShe was hesitant to uncover Roseanne\u2019s next misdeed, since she\u2019d already got her revenge on that. Besides, it seemed too trivial amongst all of her other sins.However, Philomel said her words with a feeling of \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019.\u201cAlso the young lady slapped me on the cheek while robbing me of the ring.\u201dAt that moment, the atmosphere in the audience froze. Everyone looked at the man who exuded that chilling aura.\u201cSo this woman\u2026 she dared to slapp you on the cheek?\u201dThe Emperor\u2019s voice was dozens of times colder than usual. Roseanne, who received that energy authentically, had a pale complexion like a corpse.The Emperor ordered the secretary behind him.\u201cTake this woman and bring her family. Pollan, interrogate them yourself.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take your Order!\u201dCount Pollan, who answered, disappeared.For the Emperor\u2019s secretary to interrogate them personally, it meant that the Emperor himself would decide on the punishment. And there was no light sentence in Emperor Eustis\u2019 dictionary.The Viscount family ended up collapsing splendidly afterward. In the process of investigating the crimes of the Viscount Manon, charges against the Muriel family who helped them were also discovered. The Duke of Muriel devoted a large portion of his territory to the Imperial Family, barely avoiding losing his title. However, it was unavoidable that the situation was rapidly declining. In effect, the axis of the five Ducal Families that dominated the Empire collapsed. The press, who had talked about Roseanne like a prospective Empress, shut their mouths as if it had never happened, and the Emperor restored his honor, fulfilling his promise to only know his deceased wife.Several newspapers were shut down. Compensation for the victims was made with the property of the confiscated Viscount, and the shortfall was paid by the Muriel family. The family members were imprisoned after receiving the full sentence according to the crimes committed by each of them. And Roseanne Manon, who was at the center of this situation\u2026Philomel went to see the Emperor.\u201cThat can not be done.\u201dThat was the answer the Emperor gave to Philomel\u2019s request to release Roseanne.\u201cBut haven\u2019t you tortured her enough already?Even at this level, the young lady would live with the aftereffects for the rest of her life.\u201cBut no. She deserves to die.\u201d\u201cIt is true that Lady Manon committed a great crime by pretending to be the Empress, but she doesn\u2019t deserve to die.\u201d\u201cWhy do you care so much about her? She is the one who beat you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201dPhilomel bit her lip for a moment before she spoke in a low voice.\u201cSomehow I think she is like me.\u201dTo be precise, \u2018Philomel\u2019 in the book, a girl who liked extravagance, was vain, and acted evil on others. For some reason, Roseanne had a side that overlapped with her. Besides, she seemed to be dying because Philomel had slapped her just one time, which made her feel bad.Eustis raised his voice.\u201cIt\u2019s not like that at all. Where do you resemble a woman like that?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s not now, but isn\u2019t she a bit like me when I was a kid?\u201d\u201cNot at all.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty\u2026\u201dAs Philomel persistently appealed, the Emperor eventually raised the white flag.\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s keep her alive.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dEustis\u2019s mouth went loose as Philomel smiled faintly.\u201cAh, but what happened to the ring of red flames?\u201d\u201cWe found it among the woman\u2019s belongings.\u201d\u201cThank God.\u201d\u201cI decided to dispose of it because it is dirtied now.\u201dPhilomel widened her eyes in surprise.\u201cWhy did you dispose of it! What a waste!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll make you a new one.\u201dSo he was serious when he said that he would make her a new one at the ballroom?\u201cNo, isn\u2019t the ring of Red Flame a gift given only to the Emperor and his successors? Princess Ellencia should receive it.\u201d\u201cEllencia\u2019s is under production. And I want to give it to you, so don\u2019t hesitate.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that\u2026\u201dShe was tired of arguing now. Philomel decided to just accept it. She couldn\u2019t compromise with her conscience again.\u201cOkay. Please give me the original ring to dispose of it.\u201dIn that way, the ring of Red Flame returned to Philomel\u2019s hand. Full of Eustis\u2019 divine power once again. Philomel was delighted inside as it was something she had been fond of. It\u2019s pretty useful, too. Anyway, it is said that Roseanne was seen leaving the Imperial Dungeons while limping that day. She was told that Muriel Dukedom had agreed to take her in. In a way, she was an enemy who had tilted their family, but it seemed that they felt sorry for her situation as she had no place to go even her body was not in good shape.The commotion of the new Empress seemed to come to an end in this way. But the next day, Jeremiah, with her serious face, spoke to Philomel.\u201cThey said the woman was found dead.\u201d\u201c\u2026What women?\u201dPhilomel did not understand immediately and asked with a puzzled expression. Jeremiah was talking about \u2018Roseanne.\u2019\u201cYes? How?\u201dPhilomel\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cShe was stabbed by an assailant, and she was already dead when Lexion went looking for her.\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be\u2026\u201dIt was horrifying news. She continued to listen to Jeremiah with her mouth hanging open.\u201cShe seems to have gone to her mansion to retrieve her belongings, but since there were no witnesses, they said the culprit was unknown.\u201dPhilomel held the warm cup of tea tightly without saying anything.The debts of the Viscount had been paid off beforehand, even so there must be a pretty good number of people who still hold grudges against the Manon family. Furthermore, Philomel heard that Roseanne and her family were cruel to the weak, but some sympathy arose anyway.\u2018It feels strange to hear that someone I know is dead.\u2019Philomel opened her mouth as she remembered something odd in Jeremiah\u2019s retelling.\u201cBut why did Lexion look for Roseanne?\u201d\u201cThe thing is\u2026.\u201dJeremiah took a moment to answer.\u201cWhat is it? Can you tell me a little bit?\u201d Philomel asked in her earnest voice, as she didn\u2019t want anything to happen that only she didn\u2019t know about.\u201cWe have very different values from you.\u201d Jeremiah just kept his mouth shut as he left an incomprehensible answer.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 76": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/There Is No Place For FakesCH 76Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOn the same day, in the residence of the Princess in the Western Palace.The maid, Emilie, caught a glimpse of Princess Ellencia humming a tune. The Princess seemed to be in an unusually good mood today.The Nanny lying on the bed spoke irritably, \u201cYour Highness, that melody is too frivolous! It sounds like a song that only commoners would sing. You should sing like a Princess, even when you\u2019re just humming.\u201d\u201cOkay, I got it!\u201d replied Ellencia, even brushing off the nursemaid\u2019s nonsensical criticism lightly. She usually couldn\u2019t hide her stress, even when she laughed.Emilie bit her nails.\u2018I should have been there yesterday!\u2019Yesterday, the Princess seemed to be whispering something close to another maid. Because of the errands given by the nursemaid, Emily had no choice but to leave her post.This can\u2019t go on like this.\u2018I need to bring some useful information for Miss Philomel quickly!\u2019\u2018If I can\u2019t prove my worth, I don\u2019t know where I will end up.\u2018At first, Emily also thought about sticking with Ellencia. She hesitated several times whether to tell the Princess the truth that she was being blackmailed by Miss Philomel. However, as she watched Ellencia closely, she began to have doubts.There was something strange about the Princess, whom she thought was kind and innocent. Her icy expression and actions were different from her kind words.It happened when the Princess offered to give the nursemaid a back massage.\u201cAh, Your Highness, it hurts so much!\u201d\u201cWhat can I do? Endure it a little more. They say you need to press harder when it hurts to get better,\u201d Ellencia\u2019s voice was full of concern, but Emilie saw her smiling as she heard the nursemaid\u2019s painful scream.At that moment, Emilie felt a chill down her spine.The Princess was a different person behind those kind words and angelic voice.Both Miss Philomel and the Princess were scary opponents for Emilie.Then it would have been easier to side with Miss Philomel, who already knew Emily\u2019s weakness. Blowing all of her weaknesses to Princess Elencia too, would only increase the number of people who know her weaknesses. Besides, for some reason, it seemed like Miss Philomel was more trustworthy.It was a moment when Emily was scrutinizing Ellencia, then her eyes lit up when the princess\u2019s tutors arrived. The history teacher placed the pile of textbooks on the desk.\u201cYour Highness, as I said, we will begin with the formal lessons from today.\u201dThe grace period given to Ellencia for adapting to her life in the palace was over. From today, Elensia would receive formal education in etiquette, politics and history.The history teacher looked at the textbooks and asked hesitantly, \u201cBut can you really start with the advanced course?\u201dThe Princess answered confidently, \u201cOf course! I have to catch up with Philomel quickly. If Philomel can do it, then so can I!\u201d\u201cHmm. Let\u2019s begin.\u201dHowever, the Princess\u2019s bold momentum didn\u2019t last long.Ellencia nervously rubbed her forehead. \u201cIs this really what Philomel studied?\u201d\u201cYes, it is,\u201d replied the history teacher.\u201cI don\u2019t understand this part.\u201d\u201cWell, I briefly explained it in the previous class,\u201d said the teacher.\u201cHow do you remember all of that?\u201d Ellencia asked sharply.\u201cHaven\u2019t you reviewed it since then?\u201d The Princess fell silent.The history teacher let out a small sigh and muttered to herself, \u201cMiss Philomel always thoroughly prepares for her classes, including reviewing the material.\u201dEllencia suddenly stood up and left the study room, looking quite upset. As a result, she almost collided with Emilie, who was entering the room under the guise of preparing refreshments.\u201cYour Highness! Where are you going?\u201d Emilie quickly put down the tray and followed the princess.\u201cThe bathroom! Don\u2019t follow me!\u201d The bathroom door slammed shut.A moment later, the door opened, and the Princess emerged, with her usual smile back on her face. Then, something amazing happened.The astonished teacher exclaimed with widened eyes, \u201cMy goodness! The Princess is a genius! Did you memorize all of that already?\u201d\u201cIf I have to do it, I will do it,\u201d she said with confidence, answering everything perfectly unlike in the previous class where she stuttered.The satisfied teacher left, saying that she would report this to the Emperor, and the Princess followed him.Only Emily remained in the room.However, as she was clearing up the scattered textbooks, she noticed something under the chair where Elensia had been sitting.\u201cAnd this is the object that Emilie discovered,\u201d Philomel said, placing a small bottle on the table.The yellow liquid, about half-full, shimmered inside the bottle.All four of her rich acquaintances gathered around the table in her room.Lexion, who examined the bottle closely, said, \u201cShe was a more useful servant than I thought.\u201dPhilomel agreed. Emilie showed unexpected usefulness, stealing the Princess\u2019s belongings boldly, but then again she had stolen Philomel\u2019s jewelry too, so she showed potential in that area.Jeremiah tapped the table. \u201cIf we put all the stories together, this must be a drug that enhances intelligence. Or maybe memory?\u201dLexion offered his opinion, \u201cThat\u2019s likely, but it\u2019s too early to come to a conclusion. Moreover, I roughly know about intelligence-boosting potions, but I\u2019ve never seen this color before.\u201dPhilemon said, \u201cI smelled it earlier, and it smelled like lemon.\u201dThis shocked Cadin, \u201cHow could you smell it? You have to be careful with magic potions!\u201d\u201cI just smelled it. That\u2019s all\u2026\u201d Philemon replied.\u201cWhen I was young, I sneaked into Le Guin\u2019s laboratory and drank a magical potion that looked delicious, but my body turned into a frog. You have to be careful,\u201d Cardin warned.Lexion also reminisced, \u201cI had an experience like that too. Jeremiah nearly stepped on Cardin seventeen times.\u201dCardin affectionately put his arm around Jeremiah\u2019s shoulder, \u201cHaha! This guy has a clumsy side.\u201d\u201cGet lost. I\u2019ll kill you,\u201dLooking at how Jeremiah coldly struck Cardin\u2019s arm, Philomel was convinced.\u201cThat was definitely not a mistake.\u201dAt that moment, Le Guin, who had been silent until then, caught their attention.\u201cLe Guin, why are you like that? Is there something bothering you?\u201dHe opened his mouth, which had been fixed on the glass bottle for a long time.\u201cI sense Estellion from there.\u201dEstellion was Le Guin\u2019s unique magical power.The three brothers\u2019 expressions changed at his words.Lexion nudged his father.\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\u201cUh-huh. Are you sure? It\u2019s similar, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s certain\u2026\u201d\u201cIs it one of the potions you made before, Le Guin? Magic items often carry the maker\u2019s magical power.\u201d\u201cI never made anything like that.\u201d\u201cDid you make it and forget about it? Think about it carefully.\u201d\u201cAm I suffering from dementia?\u201dJeremiah frowned.\u201cWe have to handle it even more carefully.\u201dAt that moment, Philomel raised her hand and asked a question.\u201cIs there any way to find out what kind of effect this potion has?\u201dLexion, who was clenching his jaw, replied.\u201cIf it\u2019s a medicine that helps intelligence, there might be some use in animal testing\u2026 But it\u2019s best for a person to try it and give their opinion.\u201d Le Guin made a frightening sound. \u201cLet\u2019s just catch a passerby and make them try it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not right. What if the medicine is dangerous? What crime would that person have committed?\u201d Philomel\u2019s words disappointed everyone a little.Le Guin pointed to Cardin. \u201cHey, you drink it. You like to eat anything.\u201d\u201cI hate medicine that Le Guin might have made!\u201dThe other two seemed to agree. In the end, Philomel brought back the glass bottle. \u201cI\u2019ll just drink it.\u201d\u201cWhat? No!\u201d Everyone opposed in unison.\u201cThe one who said it might be dangerous is me.\u201d\u201cPhilomel, just let Cardin drink it.\u201dPhilomel reassured the three opposing brothers.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Ellencia wouldn\u2019t have drank anything dangerous herself. And this is something I started. You\u2019re just helping me. I have to do it.\u201dPop. And the moment she pulled the cork out to drink it.\u201cGive it here.\u201dLe Guin snatched the medicine bottle from Philomel\u2019s hand.\u2018Is he trying to take it instead of me?\u2019A warm feeling started to spread throughout Philomel\u2019s chest, but the warmth disappeared as if it had been washed away at Le Guin\u2019s next action.Instead of taking it himself, Le Guin stuffed the bottle into Cardin\u2019s mouth.\u201cOOOOW!\u201dCardin writhed in agony, but the contents of the bottle quickly entered his mouth.Le Guin the cruel father held the back of Cardin\u2019s head and didn\u2019t let go until he had forced every last drop into his mouth.\u201cWell, that didn\u2019t work.\u201dLexion said this without even pretending to stop his father.\u201cIf I had said to drink it, he should have drunk it earlier.\u201dJeremiah openly giggled.\u2018\u2026They\u2019re scary people.\u2019Philomel decided not to get too close to them beyond a certain level.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 77": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/There Is No Place For FakesCH 77Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter Cardin was released from the clutches of his evil father, Lexion asked him.\u201cSo, how do you feel?\u201d\u201cUh, yeah. It was pretty good. It tasted like lemonade.\u201dCardin spoke, regaining his appetite.\u201cNot just the taste, but the effect.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 it feels like my head is clearing up\u2026\u201d\u201c37 times 9?\u201d\u201c333?\u201d\u201cDefinitely got smarter. Looks like our hypothesis was correct.\u201dLexion replied firmly, but even after confirming the hypothesis, the problem remained. How did Ellencia get this medicine? Why does Estilleon feel present in this medicine?But at this point, no one could answer those questions.\u2018It\u2019s frustrating.\u2019In fact, Philomel had not been idle during this time either. On the day of her debutante ball, she formulated a hypothesis while watching Ellencia, who\u2019s middle name suddenly was different from the book.\u2018The current Ellencia\u2019s soul may be different from the Ellencia in the book.\u2019The first thing that came to mind was possession by a demon.Philomel obtained holy water used by the actual priests who used it to exorcize demons. And when Philomel was invited to a dinner with the Emperor and Ellensia, like last time\u2026\u201cOoh, it\u2019s cold!\u201dShe lightly sprinkled the distilled holy water she had poured into a glass on the back of Ellencia\u2019s head.It was a predetermined ritual.In Philomel \u2018s heart, she wanted to ask Emily to do it, but she abandoned the idea, thinking that if a maid did it, it would cause a big fuss.It was a small amount, but Ellencia naturally noticed it.That was when Elenicia turned to Philomel, who had been talking to the Emperor all this time.Philomel made a preemptive strike before Elenicia could criticize her.\u201cOh my! Your Highness, I\u2019m sorry! My hand slipped and water sprinkled out.\u201d\u201c\u2026 How do you slip and end up sprinkling it on my head?\u201dEllenicia asked with a frown.\u201cI\u2019m really sorry.\u201dPhilomel shamelessly left the room.Philomel\u2019s fear of Ellencia was greatly diluted after Le Guin cast an automatic defense spell on her.\u201cPhilomel, you\u2026\u201dAt that moment, Eustis opened his mouth and opposed Ellencia.\u201cEllencia. Didn\u2019t Philomel apologize for her mistake?\u201d\u201cDad!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough now.\u201dAlthough Ellencia felt unjust, she remained silent.In conclusion, Philomel\u2019s assumption that Ellencia was possessed by a demon was unfounded. It was actually an unreasonable assumption to begin with.Ellencia was capable of handling Divine Power. She had even demonstrated it in front of people on her debut day. How could she handle sacred power if she was possessed by a demon?However, the fact that Philomel was even trying to explore the possibility of the book\u2019s authenticity, to the point of trying a faint possibility, was evidence that they had hit a dead end.While everyone was deep in thought, Le Guin picked up the empty bottle.\u201cI\u2019ll take this to the Magician\u2019s Tower and investigate it.\u201d\u201cBut the potion is gone, is there anything to investigate?\u201dPhilemon asked, and Le Guin pointed to the bottle.\u201cFor an ordinary magic potion container, it\u2019s remarkably well-made, don\u2019t you think?\u201dThe glass bottle was shaped like a pretty star.\u201cJudging from the attention to detail on the exterior, it\u2019s most likely be a high-end product. If we investigate, we might find out where it\u2019s sold.\u201dHis eyes narrowed.\u201cOr maybe we need to investigate the composition of the glass bottle itself, like in that book.\u201d\u201cWith book do you mean the one I gave you?\u201d\u201cYeah. I wasn\u2019t sure yet, so I hadn\u2019t said anything but\u2026 there\u2019s a good chance that the book is composed of a substance that doesn\u2019t exist in this world.\u201dLexion expressed his doubts.\u201cA substance composed of something that doesn\u2019t exist in this world\u2026is that even possible?\u201dGolden eyes sparkled.\u201cIf it\u2019s from another world, then it\u2019s possible.\u201dFrom another world\u2026does such a thing really exist?Philomel was doubtful, but her three brothers surprisingly didn\u2019t oppose the possibility any further.They seemed lost in their own thoughts.\u201cIt\u2019s just a hypothesis, but even so, it\u2019s become quite interesting to me. I might discover the power of Estellion in a place like this.\u201dLe Guin left with that sentence and teleported with a flash of light.The events of that day became an opportunity for Philomel to think about the possibility of another world.In addition to uncovering the truth about the book, Philomel\u2019s daily life was filled with various incidents.And one day, as the season gradually turned to early summer, the imperial court messenger came to Philemon\u2019s residence.\u201cThe gift that His Majesty the Emperor has prepared, is finally completed and has arrived at the Palace. Please come to the lake when you have time.\u201d\u201cGift?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the gift that the Emperor had promised for your last birthday, Miss Philomel.\u201d\u2018Ah, I had completely forgotten.\u2019Philomel looked at the golden ship minimature decorating a corner of her shelf in the receiving room. Eustis had said he would give her a real ship of the same shape.\u201cIt was still being made, but now it\u2019s complete.\u201dHonestly, she didn\u2019t need a ship. Philomel didn\u2019t particularly enjoy sailing either. Moreover, if she thought about it, it was a gift she had received when she was an Imperial Princess, so she didn\u2019t feel that great about receiving it now.Still, since it was a gift, it seemed impolite to refuse without even seeing it once, so Philomel set off on the road.When she reached the huge lake located inside the palace, the first thing that caught her eye was the magnificent ship.Indeed, it was an elegant and delicate ship.Even Philomel, who already knew the shape of the ship as she had a golden minimature of it, couldn\u2019t help but exclaim when she saw it for the first time.As she shifted her gaze slightly from the ship, she noticed a group of girls.Young ladies in their outing attire had gathered in front of the pier.Ellencia, who was at the forefront, was talking to someone.\u201cWhy can\u2019t I ride it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Your Highness. This ship is a gift from His Majesty to Miss Philomel.\u201d\u201cWhy is it? I have the right to ride it too!\u201dJust hearing Ellencia\u2019s voice gave Philomel a headache.Lexion appeared next to Philomel, who was pretending not to notice Philomel and turning his feet slightly. The two moved to a less inconspicuous place not too far away from the lake.\u201cLexion, what brings you here?\u201d\u201cI came to see the completed ship that arrived.\u201d\u201cDo you have an interest in the ship too?\u201d\u201cOf course, I participated in the construction as well.\u201d\u201cYou also build ships?\u201d\u201cTo be precise, I designed the magic spells that are attached to the ship. This ship is also a kind of magical tool.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dPhilomel nodded her head and looked up at Lexion.\u201cBut I thought managing magical tools was your job. I didn\u2019t know you were involved in construction.\u201d\u201cIt was a commission that involved a large amount of money, so I agreed.\u201dLooks like Eustis spent some money.But when Philomel lowered her eyes, Lexion said quietly,\u201cIt wasn\u2019t made hastily, but if I had known you were the owner, I would have put in more effort.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I appreciate your intentions.\u201d\u201cAre you really not going to ride it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m thinking of returning it.\u201d\u201cThe boat I made? You\u2019ve never even ridden it? I would love for you to try it at least once, Phil.\u201dShe felt bad saying no when he was asking so earnestly.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll try it out for now.\u201dEventually, Philomel moved towards the dock under Lexion\u2019s gaze.Seeing Philomel who couldn\u2019t even face Princess Ellencia, the latter had second thoughts.\u201cSo, Your Highness, this boat belongs to Philomel. I can\u2019t just let you ride on it without her permission.\u201dEllencia retorted, \u201cBut this boat was a gift from my father to Philomel when she was still a Princess. So, it was a gift to his daughter, not just to Philomel. Now that I am the Princess, it\u2019s no different than being mine.\u201dShe had her own logic, which in some ways was correct.The three attendants behind Ellencia also gave Philomel unfriendly looks.It seemed like she had invited all three high-ranking nobles, but for various reasons, Philomel had never been close to them.Ellencia looked at Philomel confidently. \u201cWhat do you think? Am I wrong? If I am wrong, tell me. I\u2019ll listen.\u201dPhilomel felt a strong annoyance rising.IShe didn\u2019t want to start a fight with Ellencia at the door of the ship over the truth of an open book.But, Lexion had expressed his wish for Philomel to ride on the ship at least once, and besides he didn\u2019t say she had to own it too. So Philomel spoke up. \u201cI\u2019m fine with it, so Princess Ellencia can have this ship.\u201dEllencia looked stunned. \u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI can have it?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dEven though Ellencia received the ship that she wanted, she didn\u2019t seem happy about it. Instead, her hand holding the handle shook as if she was angry.\u2018She\u2019s really weird.\u2019One thing for sure is that Elensia, who only smiled mysteriously when they first met, is now capable of showing negative emotions.Ellencia changed her attitude to that of the bright and loveable Princess and said enthusiastically, \u201cGreat! Since Philomel is okay with it, I\u2019ll be the first one to board this ship. Is that okay?\u201d\u201cAs you wish your Highness.\u201dHuffing, Ellencia passed by Philomel and was the first to board the ship, followed by the girls.As the boat moved with the help of magic, there was no need for people to row.The person, who was next to Philomel, kept muttering, \u201cIt\u2019s not working, why is it not working\u2026?\u201dBut he couldn\u2019t actively dissuade the princess\u2019s entourage.Philomel just watched the scene absentmindedly.\u201cI\u2019ll ask to ride later. Well, if they say no, I\u2019ll sneak in.\u201dBut the moment the last noble Lady boarded the boat\u2026Wheeeeng, wheeeeng!Suddenly, an ear screeching warning sound was heard and the boat started to jolt and shake.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 78": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/There Is No Place For FakesCH 78Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cAaah!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on!\u201dPassengers screamed as they held onto the facilities on the ship.Splash!However, the boat completely tilted, and everyone on board fell into the water.People nearby went wild.\u201cYour Highness!\u201d\u201cAre you okay?\u201dEllencia floundered in the water.\u201cHelp me! Save me!\u201dBut her rescue request stopped abruptly when she realized that the depth of the water only reached her up to her waist.The other attendants who fell together managed to walk to the shore on their own.The Palace lake was designed to deepen from the edges to the center to prevent accidents. It was natural that the location of the pier was shallow.However, since it was the Princess who fell into the water, people were in a state of confusion. Taking advantage of the commotion, Lexion approached Philomel.Without even turning around, Philomel asked him, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a safety feature. If someone tries to ride the boat without being its designated owner, the boat is designed to tip over,\u201d Lexion explained.The pleasure boat that had plunged Ellencia and her party into the water returned to its original state, with no passengers in sight.\u201c\u2026So you knew this would happen?\u201d She asked.\u201cI didn\u2019t think Phil would like to ride with the Princess, and the Princess seemed determined to ride with her own companions, so I only anticipated this might happen,\u201d Lexion replied nonchalantly.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you warn us beforehand?\u201d\u201cThe instructions were surely included with the boat. Only those who didn\u2019t read them would end up in that situation. Besides\u2026it\u2019s fun,\u201d he said, flashing a foxy smile.Ellencia ended up being carried away to her own palace, looking like a wet rat. Later it was heard that she was moaning in pain before being exposed as a fraud by the court physician who was brought by the emperor. When Philomel asked Lexion if she could change the ownership of the boat to someone else, she received the answer that it was impossible. Frustrated, she decided to just keep the ship for herself, thinking that she would buy a house by the lake later on.For now, she had no choice but to keep it in the palace lake. One person however, felt a deep sense of crisis after hearing about the gift that the Emperor gave to Philomel, it was Le Guin. Moreover, he also recently found out about the properties that the Emperor had given to Philomel.If it was money, he had plenty of it. But he didn\u2019t think that giving money would make him any different from the Emperor. After thinking for a while, Le Guin rummaged through his pockets.A little later, he approached Philomel, who was sitting at her desk reading the newspaper.\u201cPhil, look at this.\u201dHe handed her a book that looked old and had a black cover.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a magic book designated as a Golden Book. Wasn\u2019t it your birthday a while ago? It\u2019s my gift to you.\u201dPhilomel waved her hand.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not a wizard, so what\u2019s the use of me having it? And being designated as a Golden Book, doesn\u2019t that mean not to look at it carelessly?\u201dLe Guin held the book close to Philomel.\u201cNo, it\u2019s very useful. Even if you\u2019re not a wizard, with just this book, you can easily cast cursed magic.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t really want to curse anyone.\u201dBut it did sound intriguing, at least until she heard the next part.\u201cHowever, the person who cast the curse also pays a price for it.\u201d\u201cThen what\u2019s the point?\u201d\u201cUsually, curses are something that requires a certain ritual. Even if it harms me, I wouldn\u2019t try to harm others.\u201d\u201cOkay then.\u201dJeremiah, who had been watching them, intervened.\u201cWhen I asked to borrow that book for my research, you said you had lost it.\u201dLe Guin responded casually.\u201cDid I say that? I guess I was too lazy to get it for you.\u201dJeremiah frowned, but Le Guin ignored him and put the book back in his pocket.\u201cHow did it fit in there? Did you cast some magic array on your pocket?\u201dAs Philomel looked curiously at his pocket, Le Guin pulled out another item.\u201cTa-da! How about this? It\u2019s called Ginseng. You can eat it.\u201dEven Philomel knew what Ginseng was. The stem and leaves were relatively ordinary, but the roots were shaped like small human figures.\u201cWhat do you think\u2026 Ugh, it\u2019s kind of creepy.\u201dAlthough it was a precious plant with various effects, it didn\u2019t look inviting or delicious.Le Guin proudly explained.\u201cThis isn\u2019t just any Ginseng. It\u2019s the Ginseng that didn\u2019t scream when the roots were pulled out. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called the silent Ginseng.\u201dCome to think of it, it was said that a Ginseng screamed terribly while the roots were being pulled out. Some people even lost their lives from it\u2026 Ugh.\u201cIt\u2019s better if it doesn\u2019t scream, right?\u201d\u201cOf course. It\u2019s not well known, but the silent Ginseng is a great ingredient for a panacea that can cure any disease. When Ginseng root screams, many good ingredients are lost.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Uh, I see.\u201cIs this also not good enough?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s amazing, but it\u2019s just that\u2026something feels off about all the gifts you\u2019re trying to give me.\u201dAfter that, Le Guin presented several more items as gifts. But for someone like Philomel who couldn\u2019t feel happy receiving gifts like that, they were just strange items.Le Guin scratched his head and said he would find something else before disappearing to look for more things.Philomel said to Jeremiah, who was sharpening his sword, \u201cIt seems that Le Guin has a lot of rare things.\u201d\u201cIf you consider their value, they\u2019re tremendous. There are also many things that you can\u2019t even buy with money.\u201d\u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be better to receive them first and then sell them?\u2019Still, if they were such valuable things, it seemed better to go to someone who could use them more than Philomel.Jeremiah said indifferently, \u201cIf it\u2019s good for me, I think it\u2019s good for others too.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u2018He thought of me in his own way.\u2019A warm breeze blew in Philomel\u2019s heart.When she first met Le Guin, she only thought of him as the worst, but as she got to know him, she found that he had good sides as well.He wasn\u2019t regarded as much like a father, but she felt a little bit of familiarity with him.Until recently, she thought she had to get closer to him because he had helped her before, but now she doesn\u2019t pay as much attention to him as she used to.Maybe it\u2019s because Le Guin has been in the form of a cat for a long time. It also seemed to be because of his childish personality.Sometimes, Philomel herself wondered, \u2018Am I not paying enough attention?\u2019She decided to treat Le Guin better.\u2018Even if I don\u2019t like the next gift, I\u2019ll pretend to be happy!\u2019But Philomel\u2019s resolution didn\u2019t last long. That\u2019s because Le Guin returned with a giant egg and presented it to her as a gift.\u201cIt\u2019s a dragon egg. I got one from a Dragon\u2019s lair.\u201d\u201cReally? Did you get permission?\u201dLe Guin answered nonchalantly in front of Philomel, who was surprised with her mouth agape.\u201cNo. Did I need permission?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re bringing a dragon\u2019s eggs without its permission? Return it right away!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you want to raise a dragon?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t! Besides, how can a human raise a dragon?\u201d(Aoko: I would love to raise a dragon, you\u2019re so lucky Phil T-T)\u201cYou like cats.\u201dJeremiah shouted, poking his forehead from the side.\u201cAre cats and dragons the same? Go return the egg!\u201dLe Guin went to return the dragon egg, and the Empire avoided the Wrath of a powerful dragon by a hair.Philomel clarified that getting closer to Le Guin was something she needed to think about. However, other people soon appeared who also wanted to give Philomel a gift.One day, Lady Melinda and her friends visited the Southern Palace to enjoy a cup of tea with Philomel. All three of them were people who had shown an interest in Philomel since she was a Princess.While drinking tea at Southern Palace, Melinda brought up the gift she wanted to give Philomel. Lady Etwal and Lady Gordreap also expressed the same wish. The reason why these young ladies were so cautious to bring their gifts right away, was that Philomel had run away on her birthday when they originally planned to give her the gifts.\u201cI was worried that giving Miss Philomel the gift will remind her of that time,\u201d they thought, considerate of Philomel\u2019s feelings.The conversation was filled with ordinary topics, and Philomel\u2019s heart felt warm.\u2018I thought all the human relationships I made while living as a Princess were just mere illusions\u2026but they and Countess Delles, and even the Emperor\u2026 were all genuinely thinking of me.\u2019\u2018If I hadn\u2019t returned to the palace, I would never have known the story until the end. Until the moment of leaving here, I wanted to continue a good relationship with them.\u2019Philomel smiled brightly and replied to the young noble ladies,\u201cThank you, I appreciate your concerns for me.. But if those things were prepared as gifts for the Imperial Princess, they must be very expensive, is it okay to give them to me?\u201dMelinda shouted, \u201cOf course! I\u2019ll bring them next time I visit.\u201dOther people added a word each, \u201cMe too! May I tell the other noble Ladies too, who wish to give you their gifts?\u201d\u201cIf more people come, it will turn into a birthday party.\u201d\u201cA birthday party.\u201d Philomel had a good idea from those words. It would be actually the first birthday of Philomel as just Philomel, not as the Imperial Princess Philomel.Although the real birthday had passed a long time ago, it didn\u2019t matter. The day she chooses is her birthday. Philomel said spontaneously,\u201cThen I will officially invite you and the other noble ladies to my birthday party. Of course, I have to treat them since they\u2019re giving me gifts. If anyone else wants to attend, please let me know by a letter.\u201dAnd so, Philomel\u2019s belated birthday party was held.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 79": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/There Is No Place For FakesCH 79Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayPhilomel decided to prepare most of the things for her birthday party by herself. \u201c\u2018I told everyone to come, but I wonder how many people will actually show up,\u2019She thought. Above all, she wanted to show her sincere appreciation to those who truly cared for her.The venue for the banquet was decided to be sponsored by the Southern Palace.If it were just a casual gathering, it would not be a big deal, but to hold a formal party in the palace required an application process, even for non-nobles.Philomel went to the coordinator\u2019s office with her application in hand.However, the coordinator waved her off and told her to do whatever she wanted. \u201cOh dear, if I have Miss Philomel go through such a process to just hold a small party , I\u2019ll be in trouble!\u201dDespite her concerns, Philomel gave the application to the coordinator anyway.Soon after receiving permission to use the venue, Philomel also received permission to rent the necessary equipment.She opened the Southern Palace\u2019s warehouse to retrieve the items she needed, but the Palace servants blocked her way, wanting to help her move everything.Eventually, she received their assistance with the equipment and even cleaning up.However, she couldn\u2019t prepare the food herself because she had never even touched cooking utensils before.\u201cI\u2019ll have to learn later,\u201d she thought to herself as she headed to the kitchen.There, she was greeted by Harrison, the former owner of the Rainbow Bakery and now the chief pastry chef for the Imperial Family.When Philomel tried to pay him to prepare the formal party menu, Harrison jumped in protest. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessary! It\u2019s thanks to Miss Philomel that I have a job here!\u201d He said, his tone softer than when she had first met him.\u201cI heard that Miss Philomel visited our store once. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t remember it, but because of that, I didn\u2019t have to sit on the street and was able to get a position in the Imperial kitchen.\u201dAt that time, Philomel had borrowed Jeremiah\u2019s necklace to change her appearance, so it was natural that he didn\u2019t remember her.Harrison insisted on providing various desserts, including apple pie, free of charge.The situation was similar for other foods that would be prepared for the party.No one received money from Philomel.\u2018Why do they refuse when someone is offering money\u2026?\u2019Philomel returned home disappointed that she couldn\u2019t achieve what she had intended. She even began to suspect that receiving gifts from Eustis might make her appear too materialistic.However, she decided to write all the invitations herself. Philomel wrote letters one by one with the list of people to invite beside her. The attendees totaled about ten people, including Melinda, Lady Etwal, Lady Gordreap and other young ladies who had expressed their intention to attend through them.And Nassar\u2026 Oh.\u2018I wonder if I can invite him?\u2019She was worried that Nassar might feel uncomfortable since there were only young women among the invitees. But among the young men she knew, there was no one close enough to invite other than Nassar.\u201cBut I can\u2019t just not invite him\u2026\u201dThe face that looked at her with moist puppy eyes kept turning into an adult face. Moreover, he had been visiting the Southern Palace more frequently than even Melinda lately. He came for various reasons, but she didn\u2019t mind.\u201cOf course, he\u2019ll be disappointed if he\u2019s not invited, right?\u201dIn the end, she completed the invitation to the Avrydon Mansion.There were even more people who expressed their desire to be invited.\u201cWhat about me?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Would you like to attend, Le Guin?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll prepare a proper gift to bring.\u201dNo, that wasn\u2019t the problem.After the incident with the dragon\u2019s egg, Philomel ended up not receiving any gifts from him.\u201cBut oh well\u2026\u201dIt will be okay.After everyone left, Philomel urged Le Guin to come after everyone had left and gave him an invitation.So Philomel\u2019s birthday party was just one day away.Philomel hurriedly prepared for the event. She thought there wouldn\u2019t be much to do, but once she got started, there were many things she had to take care of.After decorating the table with flowers in the evening, there was nothing else to do. Compared to the parties she hosted as the Imperial Princess, it was modest, but it looked pretty in Philomel\u2019s eyes.\u201cNow it\u2019s ready!\u201dPhilomel shouted with satisfaction as she looked at the outdoor party venue that was now ready.Now all she had to do was wait for tomorrow.But on that night, mysterious shadows gathered in the Southern Palace garden.Among them, a figure with a sinister smile said:\u201cAre you ready?\u201dOther shadows nodded their heads. Their horses had stretched their necks towards the outdoor party venue that Philomel had prepared with care.It was the day of the birthday party, and Philomel woke up a little later than the scheduled time with a fluttering heart. She seemed tired from yesterday\u2019s preparations for the party.After hastily getting ready, Philomel left the inspection of the party venue to Jeremiah and headed towards the Southern Palace gate to greet the guests.\u201cI prepared today\u2019s party venue with great care, but I\u2019m not sure if there are any deficiencies,\u201d Philomel said, guiding the guests to the outdoor venue area.Fortunately, everyone said they were looking forward to it.Philomel entered the venue area with a mixture of joy and nervousness.\u201cAlright, this is where today\u2019s party will be held\u2026\u201d Philomel stopped talking. Her golden eyes trembled uncontrollably as she confirmed the state of the party venue.The surprised guests also gasped and held their breath. It was because Philomel had personally prepared the outdoor party venue, and it was so beautiful.\u201cOh my, it\u2019s so beautiful!\u201d\u201cMiss Philomel prepared this place herself?\u201dIt was because everything had transformed into something stunning, more luxurious, and brilliant, enough to widen one\u2019s eyes in amazement!\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?!\u201dPhilomel had no idea what was happening.From the entrance of the Venue, delicately carved ice sculptures greeted the guests.\u201cReal ice!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s summer, how is it not melting and staying intact?\u201d\u201cMaybe it\u2019s magic? Either way, it\u2019s refreshing.\u201dThere weren\u2019t just one or two ice sculptures. Sculptures of various forms such as angels, animals, and abstract shapes decorated the garden.The summer heat was cooled down by the chill emitted from the sculptures.That wasn\u2019t all. Flowers were blooming all over the garden too.Young ladies admired the flower beds surrounding the venue.\u201cThe chrysanthemums are pretty.\u201d\u201cBut aren\u2019t chrysanthemums flowers that bloom in the fall?\u201d\u201cYeah, why are they blooming in the middle of summer?\u201d\u201cThere are also spring flowers, azaleas, here, everyone!\u201dThe flowers were going crazy, forgetting about the sense of the season.It was easy to guess whose work all of this was.\u2018Where is that person?\u2019Philomel looked around frantically to find Le Guin, but she couldn\u2019t see the culprit.He must have been nearby, keeping watch over Philomel, but he was hiding well.\u2018He must be hiding in a high place like a tree again.\u2019As Philomel scrutinized the trees, she heard Nassar\u2019s exclamation.\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly beautiful.\u201dHe was standing in front of an ice sculpture located in the center of the venue.Philomel was amazed when she saw the statue.\u2018Jeremiah, this is too much!\u2019The ice figure had a striking similarity to Philomel\u2019s figure, looking like a goddess, bending all things around her. It was the only statue in human form, and it seemed like the most meticulously crafted one.To think they would put something like this in such a prominent place. Surely, everyone would think she is a narcissist.Nassar, who saw Philomel, said, \u201cOf course, the real Philomel cannot be compared.\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026, thank you for your kind words.\u201d\u2018Is he blind? Everyone can see that she\u2019s prettier than me.\u2019But even such a comment was turned into heavenly praise by Nassar Avrydon. His praise was full of confidence, like a gemstone.Philomel felt embarrassed by Nassar\u2019s words, feeling her cheeks flush slightly.\u201cMeow.\u201dAt that moment, a cat came between the two of them.The loud and exciting sounding meows drew the attention of Young Ladies to the cat.\u201cWow, it\u2019s so pretty! I\u2019ve never seen such a cute cat before!\u201d\u201cIts silver fur is so beautiful.\u201d\u201cBut what is the cat holding in its mouth?\u201dThe cat had an invitation card in its mouth, which was the one Philomel had written for Le Guin.\u201cLooks like it brought an invitation just like us.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s so adorable!\u201dA bright smile spread across the faces of the girls as if they were melting.\u201cEnjoy yourselves, everyone. I\u2019ll be back in a moment.\u201dPhilomel hugged the cat and disappeared behind the building.Confirming that no one was around, she spoke to the cat.\u201cLe Guin! What in the world is going on?\u201dThe cat averted its gaze and scratched its face with its hind legs.When she continued to stare at it, it tilted its head as if it didn\u2019t know anything.Philomel put her hands on her hips.\u2018I can\u2019t help it. It\u2019s already happened.\u2019The guests were surprised, but they all seemed to be enjoying themselves.Moreover, when she looked closely at the banquet hall, while it had become more splendid, the basic framework was still the one Philomel had decorated.Philomel tapped the cat\u2019s forehead with her finger.\u201cYou did it to make me happy, right? Thank you. But next time, please give me a warning or something. You scared me.\u201d\u201cMeow.\u201dAt that moment, the happy cat lifted its chin and pointed toward the sky.Looking up at the sky, Philomel was shocked and speechless. There were clouds floating in the clear blue sky in the shape of giant letters that read, \u201cHappy Birthday, Phil.\u201dShaking Le Guin\u2019s arm, she exclaimed, \u201cThis is too much! Erase it quickly before anyone sees it!\u201dAs expected, this family\u2019s birthday greetings were too much.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The guests enjoyed their freedom to mingle and chat during the reception, but as lunchtime approached, they all took their designated seats.Twelve guests were seated at three tables, and Nasser, the only man among them, sat next to Philomel. Perhaps because he had the closest relationship with her, he had the most pleasant facial expression among all the guests.During the meal, Philomel asked him, \u201cIs everything okay? Do you feel uncomfortable sitting here with all these ladies?\u201dNasser smiled and replied, \u201cNo, not at all. It\u2019s a wonderful party.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026you\u2019re the only man here, Nasser.\u201dPhilomel murmured in embarrassment.\u201cThat\u2019s what I like the most,\u201d Nasser replied firmly, although Philomel couldn\u2019t quite understand what he meant.Did he enjoy being surrounded by ladies?Philomel opened her mouth again, looking puzzled.\u201cWould it have been better if I had invited other nobles? For example, Viscount Odell, Viscount, who is a close friend of Nasser\u2026\u201dSuddenly, his charming lips tightened.\u201cI don\u2019t need friends.\u201dPhilomel became even more perplexed.\u2018Hmm\u2026 He used to have many friends before\u2026 Have his human relationships become narrow in the meantime?\u2019After the luncheon, Philomel received gifts one by one from the attendees. There were various kinds, such as earrings, silk ribbons, bookmarks, and outing hats.The last gift was from Nasser.He handed Philomel a bouquet of flowers, elegantly tied with a ribbon.Philomel\u2019s lips slightly parted.\u201cThese are\u2026\u201dShe saw several layers of pure white petals spreading widely on the fresh stems.It was a flower that Philomel was very familiar with.\u201c\u2026Philomel flowers.\u201dIt was a flower with the same name as her.However, there was something strange about it. The Philomel flower she knew had smaller buds compared to this one. And above all\u2026\u201cWhy is this flower still blooming?\u201dThat was the biggest question.The Philomel flower was a short-lived flower that only bloomed in the Utina region. More precisely, it didn\u2019t even last a day\u2014it bloomed and withered within a single night. That\u2019s why she had never seen it in person.It was nearly impossible to transport the flower from Utina to the capital before the night passed.Although hiring a skilled mage capable of exceptional transportation magic would have made it possible, Philomel didn\u2019t feel the need to go to such lengths just to see the flower. It was because she didn\u2019t like what the Pilomel flower symbolized in the language of flowers.The Philomel flower symbolized \u201cephemeral life,\u201d \u201ctransience of youth,\u201d and \u201cemptiness of good times.\u201dDespite its beauty, it represented the melancholy of a short lifespan.Well, it was a rather odd choice for a person\u2019s name. Many people didn\u2019t pay much attention to the language of flowers anyway.Nasser reassured Philomel\u2019s curiosity.\u201cWe have extended the flower\u2019s lifespan significantly through breeding and hybridization. That\u2019s why the buds have grown bigger as well.\u201dHe then handed a small pouch to Philomel.\u201cThese are the seeds. We have grown the flowers in our home garden, so they will grow well here too.\u201dShe could feel the texture of the seeds beneath the cloth.\u201cThe flower doesn\u2019t have a name yet. Please give it one, Miss Philomel.\u201dPhilomel held the bouquet to her nose and sniffed the fragrance. It was a pleasantly nice floral scent. Not too strong, not too melancholic.This flower would have a simply beautiful language of flowers attached to it. Thinking that way made her feel happy for some reason.Philomel smiled gracefully.\u201cThank you so much, Nasser.\u201dAfter the gift-giving was over, the tea party began.The seating arrangement at the table had changed from lunch, but Nasser was still seated next to Philomel.The young Ladies Melinda and Gordreap sat in the other two seats. The four of them engaged in a conversation. The topics of discussion shifted from one thing to another, with Philomel\u2019s cat becoming a topic as well. Coincidentally, Lady Gordreap also had a cat like Melinda, so the conversation flowed smoothly.That\u2019s when it happened. Lady Gordreap suddenly had a thought and made a sound of realization.\u201cBy the way, what\u2019s your cat\u2019s name, Miss Philomel?\u201d\u201cOh, the name is\u2026\u201dMelinda answered before Philomel.\u201cIt\u2019s Guinguin!\u201dNasser praised, \u201cIt\u2019s a unique and lovely name.\u201dBut from the momentary stiffness on Lady Gordreap\u2019s face, it seemed that it was only Nasser\u2019s opinion. Melinda even said something that was completely uncalled for.\u201cBy the way, the other day I saw earlier that Guinguin was in heat, and it seemed like you were worried about it, Philomel.\u201dLady Gordreap looked puzzled.\u201cOh, our cat is a female and also in heat. How about we introduce them to each other next time?\u201dPhilomel couldn\u2019t let a cat stepmom come to life, so she covered it up smoothly with a lie.\u201cWell, we were planning to have Guinguin spayed anyway.\u201dThey were chatting about such trivial matters when an uninvited guest appeared.\u201cHello!\u201dEllencia, who appeared alone in the garden of the Southern Palace, greeted everyone cheerfully.Everyone in the room stood up when the Princess appeared.Philomel approached Ellencia and greeted her.\u201cGreetings to the Little Sun of the Empire.\u201d\u201cHappy birthday, Philomel!\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s not really my birthday.\u201dThen Ellencia responded with a nonchalant smile.\u201cCongratulations though. It\u2019s the first time in your life that you\u2019re celebrating on a day other than my birthday.\u201dThe atmosphere became cold in an instant.Ellencia had a talent for pretending to say meaningful things under the guise of sincerity.Behind her recent words, there was a meaning of \u2018You\u2019ve been occupying my birthday all this time.\u2019However, Philomel responded without breaking her smile.\u201cBut what brings you here? I don\u2019t recall sending an invitation to the Princess.\u201dEllencia looked visibly upset.\u201cThis is too much! I\u2019ve been waiting for Philomel to send me an invitation, but you didn\u2019t give me one.\u201d\u201cIf you had expressed your desire, I would have given it to you.\u201d\u201cI thought it was only natural for you to give it to me without me having to ask.\u201d\u201cI apologize. I thought of hosting a modest gathering that would be unworthy of hosting someone as noble as the Princess.\u201d\u201cYeah, quite modest\u2026\u201dAs she glanced around the place, her eyes fell on Philomel\u2019s ice sculpture.Countless flowers and other sculptures. It was a gathering that couldn\u2019t even be described as modest.However, it seemed like Ellencia didn\u2019t want to admit that Philomel\u2019s gathering was splendid, so she cleared her throat and changed the subject.\u201cAnyway, seeing Philomel\u2019s gathering gave me a good idea.\u201d\u2018I have an idea of what that idea might be.\u2019With an anxious heart, Philomel squinted her eyes at Ellencia.\u201cI\u2019m planning to hold a birthday party soon too! My birthday has already passed, but I didn\u2019t receive any congratulations here. So I\u2019m planning to hold a grand one. I\u2019ll make sure to invite everyone here without exception!\u201dAs expected.Upon Ellencia\u2019s declaration, the Ladiexchanged glances with a sense of restraint.Not only did she appear in a place where she wasn\u2019t invited, but she also promoted her own gathering. It was incredibly impolite.However, the person who committed the impoliteness was none other than the Princess, so no one showed any reaction.\u2018What should I do about this?\u2019Philomel already is in a position that receives Ellencia\u2019s displeasure, so criticizing her rudeness and giving her a lesson was out of the question.If Philomel were alone she would already criticize Ellencia for her rudeness, since she had a rocky relationship with the Princess either way, but that was out of the question as there were too many bystanders.Philomel was concerned about the others present in this gathering. They are surely uncomfortable with falling out of favor with the Princess.Since no one said anything, Ellencia poked at Nassar and asked him.\u201cNassar, will you come to my gathering?\u201dHe placed a hand over his chest and deeply bowed.\u201cYour Highness, I regret to inform you that I have a prior commitment on that day and will not have the honor of attending.\u201dTrue to Nassar avrydon\u2019s character, it was a perfectly executed refusal with impeccable manners. His expression also genuinely seemed disappointed.There was only one problem\u2026 Ellencia hadn\u2019t mentioned the date of the gathering yet.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 81": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/There Is No Place For FakesCH 81Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEllencia exclaimed in astonishment, \u201cNassar, you don\u2019t even know the date of my party!\u201d\u201cOh no, I apologize. But I have prior commitments scheduled every day for the next year,\u201d Nassar replied.\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Nassar said.Nassar\u2019s natural demeanor made Philomel momentarily wonder, \u2018Is that really the case?\u2019 Of course, no matter how busy he was, it seemed unlikely to have daily commitments. \u2018Or\u2026 could it be? I remember having a tight study schedule when we were younger.\u2019Ellencia, momentarily shocked, scowled in anger and tapped her foot. \u201cYou\u2019ll regret it! My birthday party is going to be grand and spectacular, thanks to my dad\u2019s efforts! You\u2019ll definitely regret it if you don\u2019t come!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Nassar replied.Of course, Nassar couldn\u2019t care less about it.\u201cThis party will be held in a larger hall compared to the previous one. The decorations will be more splendid, and the royal orchestra will perform. After all, a true party should have an orchestra.\u201dEven after that, Ellencia continued to list more advantages of her own party, but there was no one responding positively. Everyone simply watched the Princess engage in childish behavior.At that moment, someone interjected, \u201cUm, excuse me for interrupting your conversation, but I have some information to share\u2026\u201dI don\u2019t know how long they\u2019ve been in the garden, but a servant stood there scratching his head. Ellencia asked irritably, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cI-I apologize, Your Highness,\u201d the messenger stuttered.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Ellencia asked sharply.The messenger hesitated and then spoke slowly, \u201cThe royal orchestra is currently waiting here. With Lady Philomel\u2019s permission, they will add a splendid performance to the party.\u201d\u201cWhat? The royal orchestra? Why are they here?\u201d Ellencia asked sharply.\u201cWell\u2026 The Emperor His Majesty heard about Lady Philomel\u2019s party and sent the royal orchestra. Along with words of congratulations\u2026\u201d The messenger\u2019s voice trailed off.Ellencia\u2019s beautiful face twisted in an unpleasant expression. \u201cThis is so unfair!\u201dWith a melancholic look, she left, leaving only those words behind. However, it was truly Ellencia who had gone too far.\u2018Ruining the atmosphere like this\u2026\u2019Philomel let out a small sigh. Nevertheless, the performance of the royal orchestra played a significant role in changing the mood that Ellencia had spoiled. As the beautiful melodies resounded throughout the venue, people forgot about the bewildering entrance of the Princess and immersed themselves in the music.While others enjoyed the orchestra\u2019s performance, Philomel quietly slipped away from her seat. It was a little strange. Even though the timing of the orchestra\u2019s arrival was impeccable, it felt too coincidental.\u2018Is it possible for them to appear out of nowhere at the exact moment Ellencia mentioned the orchestra?\u2019 Philomel pondered.The unexpected answer came from an unlikely source. Jeremiah, who was found sitting on a tree in a corner of the venue, nonchalantly spoke up, \u201cOh, that? I did that.\u201dPhilomel looked up at him on the tree and asked, perplexed.\u201cHow did it happen?\u201dWell, Lexion actually gave a hint to the messenger. He instructed him to roam around with the royal orchestra.It was a story I hadn\u2019t heard before.\u201cOriginally, they were supposed to stay like that until the end of the party, but I noticed the situation inside and decided to release the hint spontaneously. It\u2019s easy to release the hint when you give them a little shock.\u201d\u201cSo, that\u2019s why the messenger had a swollen forehead?\u201dBut that wasn\u2019t the important part.\u201cWhy did Lexion give such a hint?\u201d\u201cWell, it was Le Guin\u2019s idea\u2026\u201d\u201cLe Guin? Why?\u201dPhilomel raised an eyebrow at the unexpected response.\u201c\u2026There\u2019s something like that.\u201dBut Jeremiah didn\u2019t provide a proper answer. Even though Philomel continued to ask afterward, his lips remained tightly sealed.\u201cWhat\u2019s with him? He starts saying something and then stops.\u201dPhilomel grumbled quietly.After the royal orchestra finished all their performances, Philomel and the guests went to the lake for a boat ride.Philomel\u2019s boat naturally became popular among the young ladies.\u201cI want to ride!\u201d\u201cMe too!\u201d\u201cI saved a spot for myself.\u201d\u201cIn that case, I\u2019ll give mine up. Let one more person ride.\u201d\u201cNo, Lady Philomel, you can\u2019t!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t go!\u201dSince everyone was eager to ride, there was a commotion, so when Philomel said she would ride on a different boat, everyone objected.After finishing the boat ride, the group returned to the mansion, but somehow the atmosphere seemed gloomy once more.With that, the scheduled events for the party came to an end. Philomel\u2019s birthday celebration concluded successfully.\u2018Even though there were unexpected variables in the middle\u2026 they say that all\u2019s well that ends well.\u2019Philomel chose to think positively.When it was time to return home, Melinda seemed disappointed and whined, saying she didn\u2019t want to go.\u201cI\u2019m disappointed. I wanted to stay longer.\u201d\u201cThen how about having dinner and then leaving?\u201dUpon Philomel\u2019s suggestion, her face brightened.\u201cReally? Would it be alright even if it\u2019s imposing?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cWow, I\u2019m excited! Let\u2019s eat and then go.\u201dSome of the young nobles also joined for dinner. Half of them returned home, while the rest had their meal at the mansion.Nassar stayed as a matter of course.After the meal, they all played a game of jacks together. The toys Nancy brought when she was bored came in handy.After finishing the game of jacks, it was dark outside.Philomel came out to see off those who were leaving.Today was really fun. It felt like the first time in her life that she had so much fun.\u2018It\u2019s amazing. Until recently, I thought my life would only be filled with unhappiness\u2026\u2019After getting caught while she was on the run and being brought back to the imperial Palace, her unhappiness reached its peak.Philomel looked back at the sight of the palace shrouded in the darkness.A beautiful prison. The palace had been nothing but a prison to her. It was difficult to develop any attachment to a place she thought she would have to escape from someday.But ironically, the place where she found herself immersed in true happiness was also the Palace.That\u2019s when someone shouted,\u201cIt\u2019s a meteor shower!\u201dPeople walking towards the entrance of the mansion looked up.\u201cWow!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201dExclamations filled the air.Dozens, hundreds of stars were falling from the night sky.Philomel stopped and blankly gazed at that spectacle.One by one, the stars traced their paths and disappeared beyond the horizon.\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201dPure awe welled up in her heart. It was as if even the stars were celebrating her happiest day. It could only be described as a fateful coincidence\u2026Yes, a coincidence?\u2018Surely not. It can\u2019t be.\u2019Philomel, feeling an odd sensation on the back of her head, turned around.\u201cMeow.\u201dThe cat proudly meowed, as it always did.You\u2019re killing me.Later, it was revealed that the meteor shower was also an illusion created by Le Guin\u2019s fantastic magic.Philomel had been worried about what would happen if the memories of the young maids and other people didn\u2019t match, but Le Guin confidently replied that it was fine.He said it was a large-scale illusion magic that made the meteor shower visible throughout the capital.That was the least of her concerns, Philomel thought, and let it go.Would anyone notice something strange and suspect that it was all done to celebrate one person\u2019s birthday? Surely not.Philomel had learned to casually overlook Le Guin\u2019s actions. Anyway, that was a matter for later.At this moment, Philomel was admiring the beautiful meteor shower.Even though she knew it was an illusion, it was still beautiful. In fact, it seemed even more beautiful to think of it as a meteor shower just for her.\u201cPhilomel.\u201dShe turned her head and saw Nassar right beside her. She hadn\u2019t even noticed him approaching while she was engrossed in the meteor shower.Nassar spoke softly.\u201cIt\u2019s truly beautiful.\u201dIn the silence of the surroundings, a melodic voice gently spread.\u201cI adore you.\u201dLooking into Philomel\u2019s eyes, the red irises of Nassar seemed to glow like stars.It was a beautiful night.In the darkness of the night, Count Pollan asked.\u201cYour Majesty, do you really not want to meet her?\u201dThe Emperor, looking down at the Southern palace from the hill, replied, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dThe crowd heading towards the main gate to board the carriage was clearly visible.\u201cIt seems that my child currently doesn\u2019t need my gift.\u201dHe received the box that the Count was holding and opened the lid.A tiara adorned with tightly packed pearls revealed its Majestic presence. The blue gem in the center shone brilliantly.\u201cIf it\u2019s that child, she must have already received much more meaningful gifts, so she won\u2019t accept something like this.\u201dCount Pollan cautiously suggested..\u201cWell, since you\u2019re here anyway, even if you can\u2019t give the gift, at least see Miss Philomel\u2019s face once.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s already too late.\u201dIt was due to the prolonged council meeting.\u201cAnd\u2026\u201dA self-deprecating smile crossed the Emperor\u2019s lips.\u201cIf she looks at my face on this fine day, it will only hurt her feelings.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s just that I couldn\u2019t bear to keep it inside any longer\u2026\u201dAfter confessing, he simply got on the carriage and returned home.Normally, he had a face that often couldn\u2019t express himself properly, but at that moment, he had a serene expression that was surprisingly calm. It led to frivolous thoughts.\u2018Indeed, Nassar likes me.\u2019In truth, Philomel already knew. From a certain point, She had been thinking, \u2018Could it be that?\u2019 Unlike Ellencia, who hadn\u2019t noticed, Philomel sensed Nassar\u2019s dislike for Ellencia.Until yesterday, she had believed that all the kindness Nassar showed her stemmed from his sense of duty as her fianc\u00e9 and their friendship.Among them, there were some moments that seemed excessive to be attributed to mere duty or friendship\u2026 but due to the contexts of <Princess Ellencia> the truth of Philomel\u2019s life, she chose to pretend they didn\u2019t hold any meaning .Philomel wondered if Nassar would fall for Ellencia, or even if he didn\u2019t, the image of Nassar as \u201cEllencia\u2019s man\u201d was too strong in Philomel\u2019s mind.And there were many other things that occupied her thoughts. The truth of the book, Ellencia, Eustis, Le Guin, Jeremiah, and others\u2026 Oh, even Roseanne had a greater presence in Philomel\u2019s mind than Nassar.Amidst the entanglement of those who made Philomel tense, Nassar\u2026 \u2018What should I say?\u2019 When they were together, he was a comfortable person who didn\u2019t require complicated thoughts.\u2018But now, Nassar is the one who gives me the most anxiety.\u2019Philomel looked at the bouquet of flowers placed on the side table.New flowers for the new Philomel.\u2018I had a feeling that soon he would express his feelings clearly.\u2019The moment her vague suspicion turned into certainty was when she received those flowers from him as a birthday gift yesterday.It was an incredible feat to develop a new breed of flowers that bloom only for one night in Utina. Without exceptional patience, it would have been impossible. Even if someone ordered it, the cost would be exorbitant.\u2018How could I not know that he would give such a gift for my birthday?\u2019What Philomel didn\u2019t know was that he would confess his feelings on that day.\u201cI adore you.\u201d Not \u201cI like you\u201d or \u201cI love you,\u201d but an excessively weighty confession with \u201cadore.\u201dShe wrapped her head with both arms.\u201cI have to do something somehow.\u201dPhilomel couldn\u2019t accept his feelings. Even though Nassar said it was okay not to give an immediate answer, she couldn\u2019t let him hold onto futile hope.\u2018Fine. Let\u2019s reject him. Let\u2019s minimize the damage to his feelings as much as possible.\u2019But before that, there was another matter that needed to be dealt with.After having a meal and completing her preparations, Philomel left the Southern Palace.Her destination was the Imperial Office.She had to meet Eustis immediately.The Emperor seemed tired as if he had worked late yesterday.\u201cPhilomel, did the birthday banquet go well yesterday?\u201d\u2018Oh, come to think of it, didn\u2019t he send the Imperial Orchestra yesterday. I was preoccupied with various things and completely forgot.\u2019Philomel briefly expressed her gratitude and brought up the main issue.\u201cYour Majesty, please allow me to break off the engagement with Little duke Nassar Averydon.\u201dThat\u2019s right. The engagement between her and Nassar was still intact.\u2018I\u2019m not sure of the reason myself.\u2019In the book, it was clearly stated that once it was revealed that Philomel was not a Princess, the engagement would automatically be broken. However, seeing that it didn\u2019t happen like that, it seemed to require specific actions.An engagement is a promise between households.When breaking this promise, it usually required a request from one side, followed by discussions between the families for annulment.So in this case, either the Emperor or Duke Averydon had to bring up the topic of annulment first.Duke Averydon would probably be eager to annul the engagement by now.\u2018He probably doesn\u2019t want to send his well-raised son to a despised woman.\u2019But so far, the Duke hadn\u2019t taken any specific actions.A vague speculation was that perhaps Philomel\u2019s position hadn\u2019t plummeted yet, so he didn\u2019t want to demand annulment right after it was revealed that she wasn\u2019t a Princess.\u2018He\u2019s a nobleman, so he\u2019s probably waiting for the right time.\u2019Philomel also waited for the Duke to take action. The problem was that it was taking too long. Impatient, Philomel decided to take matters into her own hands.However\u2026Anger flashed on the Emperor\u2019s face. His voice trembled with anger.\u201cHow dare that insignificant Averydon say he doesn\u2019t want to marry you just because you\u2019re not my biological daughter?\u201d\u201cYour, Your Majesty?\u201d\u201cOr is it the big one? Tell me. Who said that?\u201dPhilomel was taken aback.\u2018Why is he getting so angry?\u2019Even as the Emperor, it would be better for him to break this engagement. There\u2019s nothing good that can come out of maintaining a strained relationship with a powerful noble.\u2018Could it be\u2026 Is there a special reason why Eustis hasn\u2019t brought up the annulment request first?\u2019Until now, she thought he was simply being lazy or busy.In any case, if she remained passive, it would only bring trouble to Nassar\u2019s side for no reason. So Philomel hastily denied it.\u201cNo! It wasn\u2019t demanded by the Averydon House. It\u2019s my own will.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t deceive me. That cunning old fox and his lineage must have manipulated you well.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not true. Do you see me as someone who gets easily manipulated?\u201dFortunately, it seemed that her words were accepted, and Eustis fell silent for a moment.\u201c\u2026Is it sincere?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s sincere.\u201d\u201cWhy do you want to break the engagement?\u201d\u201cI, as a commoner, cannot be married to someone from a family like the\u00a0 Duke Averydon\u2019s\u2026 \u201cEustis extended his hand.\u201cIf that\u2019s the reason, there\u2019s no need to listen. I\u2019ll handle it myself, so you don\u2019t have to worry.\u201d\u201cBut isn\u2019t it customary for nobles to marry someone of the same social standing?\u201dPhilomel spoke in a low voice.\u201cI married the person I wanted.\u201d\u2018Oh, you\u2019re such an exceptional romanticist! That\u2019s not the norm!\u2019\u201cEven if I marry the little Duke, how would they perceive me, a commoner, in the Duke\u2019s family\u2026\u201d\u201cIf it bothers you, tell me. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d\u201cI apologize, but it seems Your Majesty has already made up your mind\u2026\u201d\u201cAs long as the royal family doesn\u2019t end up being assassinated from generation to generation, the bloodline will continue.\u201dSuperficial reasons won\u2019t work.Philomel decided to be honest and open about her true feelings.\u201cI don\u2019t have any feelings for the little duke. That\u2019s why I want to break off the engagement.\u201dAt that moment, Eustis\u2019s eyes widened. For someone who had limited emotional expressions, especially surprise, it meant he was extremely astonished.He was the person who appeared nonchalant even when Roseanna was dancing or whatever.\u201cLies.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a lie.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe that.\u201d\u201cWhy are you so convinced?\u201d\u201cIf I didn\u2019t arrange your engagement with that guy when you were young, you said you wouldn\u2019t eat anything, didn\u2019t you?\u201dPhilomel swallowed her words.\u2018\u2026Did I say that?\u2019She had no memory of it.When she got engaged to Nassar, she was only six years old. Her memories were relatively vivid after she turned nine and started reading books, but before that, they were vague.Eustis continued speaking.\u201cYou said you wouldn\u2019t get up from the floor during a meeting until I arranged your engagement with him.\u201d\u2026Even during a meeting?In her memory, it remained as a mere tantrum.But it didn\u2019t end there.\u201cWhen I tried to go somewhere else, you clung to my ankles and cried, not letting me leave.\u201dConfronted with her embarrassing past, Philomel felt like hiding herself even under a rock. If she could go back to the past, she wanted to slap her younger self.\u201cBut more importantly\u2026 \u201c\u201cYou can stop now!\u201dPhilomel slammed the desk, interrupting the Emperor\u2019s words.\u2018What am I doing?\u2019She quickly regained her composure and coughed lightly.\u201cAnyway, that\u2019s a story from when I was six years old. My feelings have changed since then. Your Majesty, even at that age, it\u2019s not like one\u2019s liking for the opposite sex lasts a lifetime. You know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m not sure, but if you say so, then maybe it\u2019s true.\u201dEustis seemed somewhat uncertain, but he seemed to accept it.\u201cAlright. I will order the annulment with Duke Averydon\u2019s House.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dWith that, Philomel achieved what she desired and returned to her chambers.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I should have endured that moment.\u201dThe energy and vitality that had filled him the previous night were nowhere to be found now.\u201cThe Emperor simply commanded the breakup without any reason, but I know that it is not your will, Miss Philomel.\u201dFeeling sorry for it, Philomel spoke up.\u201cNassar\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cPlease don\u2019t apologize. It only makes me more miserable.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dYet, Philomel had offered an apology solely to ease her own heart.Nassar, whose rough lips trembled, finally uttered a single word.\u201cDo you dislike me?\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d\u201cThen why do you want to break up?\u201d\u201cDoes it really matter now?\u201dPhilomel asked quietly.She knew that bringing it up would only cause more pain to both of them.\u201cIt does matter! Could it be because of Princess Ellencia? You strangely didn\u2019t seem concerned about the relationship between her and me. If that\u2019s the reason\u2026\u201dHe seemed to hope that Philomel would say that the reason for the breakup was because of Ellencia.Philomel took a deep breath.He finally forced those words out of his mouth.\u201cI don\u2019t love you.\u201dNassar\u2019s pupils dilated, and his mouth fell open at Philomel\u2019s words.A profound shock swept over him.With a face full of astonishment, he spoke in a trembling voice.\u201cAh, I knew it. I couldn\u2019t have not known. Otherwise, you wouldn\u2019t have kept pushing me away all this time.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d\u201cYes. From a certain moment in our childhood up until now, whenever I tried to approach you, you always smiled and drew a line.\u201dWas that so? She had only wanted to alleviate the burden he carried as her fiance and as the little Duke\u2026 No, that\u2019s just an excuse.While there may not have been a complete absence of reasons, fundamentally she had erected a wall between them. Because he was destined to be Ellencia\u2019s lover.Yes, it was undoubtedly Ellencia\u2019s presence, soon to be revealed in the book, that marked the beginning.Until then, young Philomel had liked Nassar very much.Even after realizing that he didn\u2019t love her, she would have continued to like him.But through that book, she had learned about Nassar\u2019s future, where he would wholeheartedly love Ellencia.She had come to know that he was capable of loving someone so deeply.\u2018If only I didn\u2019t know, I would have thought he was someone who couldn\u2019t love deeply while being affectionate.\u2019But now, Nassar loves Philomel.However, tragically, Ellencia was no longer the issue. The issue was that Philomel\u2019s feelings for Nassar had vanished.Philomel did not love Nassar anymore.That was the beginning and the end of the problem.Nassar spoke with a pained expression on his face.\u201cI wanted to deny it. I desperately believed that your current heartless appearance was just a facade because you used to like me.\u201dSo that\u2019s how it was. She had never realized.Philomel listened quietly to his words.\u201cAfter you disappeared and came back, it seemed like you were closer to me than before, and I had hope, just in case, just in case.\u201dHe continued to blame himself.\u201cIn truth, it took me a long time to fully realize my feelings. I must be such a fool, right?\u201dHe didn\u2019t seem like a fool at all.It was just regrettable. If only he had realized and expressed his emotions even a little earlier, maybe things would have been different.There was a slight possibility.How could the human heart be sliced like a knife?The young Philomel\u2019s affection for Nassar didn\u2019t disappear in an instant. It gradually eroded from within the mask.\u201cIf that were the case\u2026\u201dBut it was a meaningless assumption.Philomel sincerely wished that he wouldn\u2019t suffer.\u201cNassar, stop now. Don\u2019t belittle yourself. You are a good person enough.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the use of that if you don\u2019t love me!\u201dHis own voice was loud, and Nassar himself was the most surprised.\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry. I lost my mind for a moment and was rude\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dPhilomel raised her sunken gaze to look at him. Nassar hadn\u2019t properly looked at Philomel.After a moment, his intense gaze turned back to Philomel.\u201cCan\u2019t it be me after all?\u201dHis eyes welled up with moisture.\u201cYou said you don\u2019t dislike me, right? Isn\u2019t that the case?\u201dPhilomel knew that it would be a hurtful remark, but she had no choice but to express her sincere feelings.\u201cI don\u2019t dislike you. I like you, as a friend.\u201d\u201c\u2026Then please don\u2019t break off the engagement.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dPhilomel\u2019s eyes widened in surprise at the unexpected words.\u201cI will undoubtedly be of help to Miss Philomel. Though it may sound arrogant, I excel in academics and martial arts, and I can even cook\u2026?\u201d\u201cWhether it helps the engagement or not, why does it matter?\u201d\u201cThen how can I stay by your side?\u201d\u201cNassar, you need to find someone who loves Nassar.\u201dReluctantly, tears rolled down Nassar\u2019s cheeks.\u201cBut\u2026 the person I love is you.\u201dPhilomel couldn\u2019t say anything.There was no word that could be said for the sake of Nassar.After enough time for the tears to dry up, Nassar spoke.\u201cIf, by any chance, there is someone you have in your heart?\u201dNot wanting to lie, Philomel spoke as it was.\u201cNo. There isn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cThen please allow me to like you a little more.\u201d\u201cNassar!\u201d\u201cYou said you feel something like friendship towards me, so I want to be by your side as a friend, at least.\u201d\u201cBut you can\u2019t.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t Miss Philomel once tell me to do what I truly desire?\u201dPhilomel was speechless.Eustis, and now Nassar, why do they remember the past so well?\u201c\u2026It will only cause suffering for Nassar.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201dNassar smiled with traces of tears on his face.\u201cIf I\u2019m not a burden to you, then I should endure the rest.\u201dThat\u2019s how Nassar left.Philomel watched him leave the Palace through the window.As if he felt her gaze, he looked up at the window where Philomel was.But their gazes couldn\u2019t meet.Le Guin, leaning his arm against the window, spoke.\u201cThat jerk? Should I get rid of him for you?\u201dPhilomel realized that Le Guin used magic to block the view outside the window from her sight.\u201cNo, don\u2019t talk like that. Nassar is a good person.\u201dNassar stood still in that spot for a while, staring at the window. Then he took heavy steps and moved away.Philomel slumped into the armchair as if collapsing.The light was too bright, so she covered her eyes with her arm.Le Guin asked, \u201cPhil, are you in pain?\u201d But she only shook her head.Jeremiah also seemed to sense her mood, but Philomel didn\u2019t want to do anything.She couldn\u2019t do it. She couldn\u2019t completely reject Nassar.If she had truly thought about him, she should have pushed him away until the end\u2026 but she accepted the person who said they would stay by her side halfheartedly.Why did she do that?Out of guilt? Because she didn\u2019t want to be seen as a bad person by Nassar?Or maybe, because she thought that if he made an effort, a good future awaited them?\u201cI\u2019m the one who\u2019s truly foolish.\u201dPhilomel murmured to herself.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Especially Duke Averyden, who expressed his satisfaction and always said, \u201cIndeed, he is my son.\u201dNassar liked hearing those words. He wanted to receive more praise from his father, so he worked even harder.However, the more he worked hard, the more responsibilities he had, and his time with people he liked decreased.\u201cIt\u2019s tough,\u201d Nassar, who was only seven years old, fell into a sense of disillusionment.No matter how hard he tried, there seemed to be no good outcome.But if he didn\u2019t work hard, the situation only got worse.The expectations from his father for Nassar were already high, and there was no possibility for the boy to return to the way things were if he slacked off.It was during that time that he first met the Princess, a cute girl one year younger than him.\u201cWow! You\u2019re pretty! What\u2019s your name? I\u2019m Philomel. Want to be friends?\u201dAs soon as Nassar met the girl, she said that enthusiastically and showed her liking for him.\u201cNassar, let\u2019s get married!\u201dHonestly, Philomel was burdensome to him.He appreciated her affection, but the boy was overwhelmed by people\u2019s favor. He had become too accustomed to receiving kindness from others to place a high value on the favor of one person.Nevertheless, the Duke was more than willing when he heard the news.\u201cThe Princess has taken a liking to you! You, Indeed, are my son!\u201dNassar was confused.Wasn\u2019t his father\u2019s praise something he could only receive when he worked hard?But he had put little effort into winning the Princess\u2019s love.Although they occasionally talked and treated each other kindly, Nassar\u2019s personality was inherently limited in showing affection to anyone.When the engagement with the Princess was decided, the Duke\u2019s satisfaction reached its peak.\u201cWell then! Who else could become the Emperor\u2019s husband if not my son? I\u2019m proud of you.\u201dIndeed, Nassar had made little effort leading up to the engagement. The engagement was a result obtained by the Princess from the Emperor.Thus, Nassar\u2019s self-esteem diminished.\u201cIf my worth is determined solely by receiving the love of the Princess, then what have all my efforts been for?\u201dNassar didn\u2019t want to admit it.To admit that would mean that most of his short life had been in vain, filled with futile efforts.So Nassar continued to make relentless efforts. He believed that if he worked hard and continued to do so, eventually his father would come to value the worth of his efforts more.One day during playtime, the Princess said, \u201cNassar, why are you doing something so boring? Instead of studying, let\u2019s play together!\u201dNassar felt that he wasted precious time every week when he met the Princess. He had reduced his sleep time at home to study, but whenever he was in the Palace, he felt extremely idle.Nassar tried to make use of that idle time by teaching the Princess about various things. He would review while teaching her, and it would be beneficial for both of them.However, the Princess seemed to have a different opinion.After persistently persuading the reluctant Princess, she spoke with a sulky face.\u201cWhy do I have to do it? I don\u2019t want to. My father doesn\u2019t care.\u201dIt was a shock to Nassar as if the heavens and the earth were being overturned. Until now, his father had always told him that he must fulfill various obligations as the heir of Duke Averyden, one of the five dukes of the Bellerov Empire and the most prestigious noble family in the empire.Nassar had unwaveringly believed in those words.Then, what about the Emperor? Isn\u2019t the Emperor\u2019s position higher and more burdensome than that of a Duke? But why doesn\u2019t the Princess, who is destined to become the Emperor, have any special responsibilities?In reality, no one seemed to care, even if the Princess neglected her studies and ignored etiquette.The Princess\u2019s attendants would nag at her, but they didn\u2019t seem to believe that the Princess would change.Nassar confided in his father about these concerns.\u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into you? Just let the Princess do as she pleases.\u201d\u201cWhat? But isn\u2019t it the duty of a loyal subject to advise and guide the lord when they stray onto the wrong path?\u201dThe Duke sighed and spoke.\u201cWell, you see, it\u2019s about time you learned the reality of this. Teachers have instilled too many ideals in you. It\u2019s time for you to learn about my reality.\u201dAnd the following words were truly shocking.\u201cIf the Princess becomes an incompetent Emperor, won\u2019t you interfere in state affairs? If she tries to do everything like the current Emperor, we\u2019ll all be at a loss.\u201d\u201cDid you think that I paid attention to your education just to keep you occupied with simple paperwork?\u201dThe values and beliefs that Nassar had upheld were shaken to their core.The noble sense of duty he had been taught was nothing more than a facade. He felt disappointment and disillusionment towards his respected father.The boy fell into deep confusion.Perhaps to conceal this turmoil, he may have acted even more coldly towards the Princess, who kept insisting on playing together.\u201cThen, Your Highness, please play alone. I will focus on studying.\u201dNassar\u2019s initial coldness caught the Princess off guard.After calling him multiple times and receiving no response, the Princess reluctantly burst into tears.\u201cDuke! What should I do? Nassar hates me!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way he\u2019d hate Your Highness. I will talk to him.\u201dNassar could never forget the magnificence his father displayed when he smiled kindly at the Princess that day.It was the first time he had witnessed such tenderness, despite the hardships he had endured since birth.One sad aspect was that he still loved his disappointed father and his mother, who could only watch over him.And Nassar was a child who couldn\u2019t survive without the shelter of their presence.So he redirected his resentment.All the doubts and confusion began when he met the Princess.He resented the Princess who had thrown him into this turmoil. It was partly born out of envy.The indifference shown by the Emperor to the Princess at that time was what Nassar had earnestly prayed for from his parents.However, Nassar didn\u2019t hate the Princess. He naturally felt fondness towards someone who liked him sincerely.Moreover, he felt sorry for the Princess. She was a lonely person. At times, he felt the desire to be a source of strength for her.However, Nassar couldn\u2019t empathize deeply with that loneliness. He was surrounded by too many people to truly experience loneliness.Nassar\u2019s feelings towards the Princess were complex.There were times when he liked her and times when he didn\u2019t. There were moments when the girl\u2019s favor was gladly received and moments when it felt burdensome.One thing that was certain was that Nassar was a presence prepared for the Princess.The disappointment towards his father remained, but his rebellion gradually diminished. It was a resignation.If he couldn\u2019t change his parents, it was easier to be on their side.Time passed in this manner.Even though the Princess started using honorifics for him and Nassar grew taller, nothing changed.No, he believed it wouldn\u2019t change.However, a change occurred. He was ten years old, and the Princess was nine.The Princess suddenly changed at some point. It was a very abrupt transformation.Nassar tried to find the cause in his own way but failed.Although there were hints, he thought it would be difficult for a person to undergo such a significant change.As he watched his playtime with the shrinking Princess, the boy became afraid.\u2018What if the Princess no longer needs me?\u2019It meant that the significance of Nassar\u2019s existence would completely disappear.One day, he kneeled before the Princess and pleaded. He wanted her to let him know, If he had done something wrong.And that day, the boy had a peculiar experience.\u201cRepeat the words after me.\u201d\u201cI am a precious person.\u201d\u201cI was not born for the sake of someone else.\u201d\u201cI will live according to my own heart.\u201dInitially, he followed the Princess\u2019s instructions involuntarily, but repeating the same words made him feel strange.Words held power.Although that incident didn\u2019t dramatically change his life, it ignited a flame in his dwindling rebellion.Gradually, he changed, like clothes soaked in drizzling rain.While he didn\u2019t directly defy the Duke, his father, he no longer nodded his head as he did before in response to his praise or approval.He could hear the scolding with one ear and let it pass through the other. Occasionally, he acted contrary to the given instructions.The Duke exclaimed that his son had become arrogant as he grew up.However, there was nothing he could do.Nassar remained a coveted child and the heir who would inherit the family externally.He wasn\u2019t the only one who changed. The Princess began her transformation into a perfect heiress.The Duke found it difficult to handle the Princess and expressed his frustration. Nassar, too, wasn\u2019t particularly pleased with the Princess\u2019s changes.Clearly, he had hoped she would become an Emperor worthy of admiration.That incident was a fleeting moment, and the relationship between him and the Princess drifted apart once again.Nassar wanted to close the widening gap, but there was no way. The more he approached, the farther the Princess moved away.Her focus seemed to be on her relationship with the Emperor, not with Nassar.Outwardly, they maintained a respectful engagement, but inside, there was nothing but awkwardness, no different from strangers.Until then, he had not realized his own emotions.He believed that his feelings towards the Princess were nothing more than sympathy as someone burdened with a similar weight.Perhaps because she had been someone he had taken for granted without much thought since a young age, he might have been slow to notice his feelings.For Nassar, that place became the starting point of his self-awareness of his emotions.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The official reason was an inspection, but in reality, it was a vacation.The Duke had his own intentions as he discussed the fatigue of the Princess in front of the Emperor.\u201cRecently, I\u2019ve been concerned about the strained relationship between the Princess and you. Take this opportunity to get closer.\u201d\u2018Without even asking for it.\u2019Nassar felt a bit disgruntled.Although Saint Jen was the most prosperous commercial city in the northern region, it wasn\u2019t an ideal environment for leisure.Since they were going to have time alone together, why not go to a beautiful place with clear water?The gloomy scenery of Saint Jen visible from the carriage only intensified his dissatisfaction.On the other hand, the Princess seemed content. After all, she had always silently fulfilled her responsibilities. The visit to Saint Jen was no different from other duties for her.Somehow, he felt melancholic.But when they arrived at the central district of Saint Jen, they saw a peculiar sight. Buildings, streets, and people were covered in white flowers as if there was nothing else but those flowers.At that moment, Nassar witnessed a glimpse of surprise in the Princess\u2019s eyes as she looked outside.What are those flowers?The identity of those flowers became known when they met the governor of Saint Jen.The governor was a typical flatterer. He greeted them while gently touching his palms together.\u201cOh my! I have the honor of meeting the esteemed Imperial Princess. And the noble offspring of Duke Averydon!\u201dWhen Nassar was alone with the governor, he subtly asked about the identity of the flowers.The market puffed up his chest as if he had heard praise.\u201cI took special care because Her Highness was visiting! Wouldn\u2019t it displease her if there were people with the same name in the vicinity?\u201dAh, the identity of the flowers turned out to be paper-made Philomel. Of course, they weren\u2019t real.The market had instructed people to create a harmony made of paper.Although Nassar had seen pictures of Philomel flowers, he couldn\u2019t recognize the paper flowers on the streets of Saint Jen because they looked so shabby.How could genuine Philomel flowers be found in a place like this?In the first place, the Utina region where Philomel flowers bloom was far away from Saint Jen.The governor was foolish.He doesn\u2019t even know that the Princess doesn\u2019t particularly like Philomel flowers.But it was Nassar\u2019s own arrogance that was what was truly foolish.Their time in Saint Jen quickly passed by.Although it was supposed to be a schedule of over a week, in the blink of an eye, it was time to return to the capital.There was no significant progress in their relationship during their time in Saint Jen.Nassar prepared for his return with a sense of regret. However, they were interrupted by a sudden rainstorm while discussing with the coachman.Although the precipitation in Saint Jen was within the normal range, it was said that there was heavy rain pouring down in the region they had to pass through on their way back. The road was completely muddy, and in some sections, landslides even occurred.Nassar sighed.\u201cWith a few teleportation spells, we could easily go back.\u201dSince the ostensible purpose was an inspection, it didn\u2019t look good to visit other regions.Nassar didn\u2019t mind, but the Princess even paid attention to such trivial matters in her naivety.In their desire to become closer to her, some people who only knew Nassar superficially still thought he was an exemplary gentleman.Nassar, the Empire\u2019s finest fianc\u00e9.\u201cIf they knew how audacious you can be, they would all be dumbfounded!\u201dHis friend Canny would often tease him with those words.Nassar Averydon, who used to hold his father\u2019s words as sacred had disappeared.What remained was a cunning man who still pretended to be that way, wanting to impress his fianc\u00e9.\u2018Why go to such lengths?\u2019He often wondered about it himself.He genuinely liked the Princess as a person. After all, they had spent a long time together, so it was natural to feel a sense of familiarity.There were also personal reasons that he was grateful for. He had a desire to serve as her loyal subject. She was a good Emperor in the making, after all.But even combining all these reasons, he couldn\u2019t understand why he had to hide his true self.Should he give up now? He had done enough.He grew tired of knocking on a door that wouldn\u2019t open.Then, the Princess appeared outside the hotel in Nassar\u2019s sight. Everyone else was busy with other tasks, so there was no one to hold an umbrella for her.Nassar\u2019s body moved on its own.\u201cYour Highness, you\u2019ll catch a cold!\u201dHe held out the umbrella he was carrying to the Princess.\u201cOh, Nassar.\u201dThe Princess turned to look at him.In return, Nassar\u2019s clothes began to get wet. But he was fine. He was confident in his stamina and health.In contrast, the Princess\u2019s small shoulders seemed to tremble.\u201cPlease go inside now. The rain is getting heavier.\u201d\u201cJust a moment. Let me pick these up and go.\u201dOnly then did Nassar realize that the Princess was crouching down and picking something up? They were the paper flowers that had fallen into puddles.The fake Philomel flowers that had been displayed in the hotel were almost completely scattered on the ground after being soaked in the rain.The wet paper flowers became even more pitiful in appearance. They were simply trash.Nassar couldn\u2019t understand. Why would someone like her be picking up such trash, even getting drenched in the rain?Nassar concealed his dissatisfaction and asked nonchalantly.\u201cWhy are you picking up those paper flowers? Is there a special reason?\u201d\u201cThey were specially made to welcome me, so I thought of taking them as a memento.\u201dEven after hearing the explanation, Nassar still didn\u2019t understand.If it was a memento, there were plenty of other nice things. If she wanted insignificant paper flowers, he would have chosen the most beautiful and intact ones.Above all, why would she want fake flowers? She didn\u2019t even particularly like real Philomel flowers.Nassar blurted out, \u201cThey\u2019re just fake anyway.\u201dUpon hearing his words, the Princess fell silent for a moment.A little while later, she looked at Nassar and smiled faintly.\u201cIt\u2019s pitiful if they\u2019re discarded here as fakes and get ruined by the rain.\u201dIt was a smile that stuck in his heart.At that moment, Nassar realized that he loved this person.He couldn\u2019t explain the exact reasons himself. He just\u2026 for some reason, it felt like the Princess would disappear at that moment. She seemed so faint and fragile that she might vanish before his eyes.He felt a desire to hold onto those shoulders, to pull her towards the place where he stood.With the awareness of his love, he also realized why the Princess\u2019s changes hadn\u2019t been particularly pleasing to him. She had become like a decoration of a Princess. The position of a Princess was not her decoration; she was the decoration of the position of a Princess.People praised her as an elegant and merciful Princess, but they didn\u2019t know what kind of person she truly was. It was because she thoroughly hid her true self.Would the Emperor know?Nassar thought that he probably didn\u2019t know either.Nassar always harbored silent anxiety about when the Princess would disappear.That\u2019s why he couldn\u2019t bear her changes. He wanted to know what kind of person she was. He wanted to grasp her clear essence.Nassar loved the Princess.No, that\u2019s wrong. He loved her, not as a Princess, but as a person.\u2018Oh, please, let me know the real you, not the Princess. My Philomel.\u2019Even though Nassar had realized his feelings, it didn\u2019t bring about any significant change in their relationship.He suddenly became afraid. He was now clearly aware of the reasons why he shouldn\u2019t lose her, and the fear of losing her gripped him too strongly. He had become a coward.He wanted to know her.But she didn\u2019t want to reveal herself.What if Nassar wants to know?Philomel, whom he had pushed away even when he wasn\u2019t aware of his feelings. It was obvious what would happen when he actively approached her after realizing his love.\u2018I\u2019ll throw myself away.\u2019He didn\u2019t know it would even break off their engagement.Their engagement was originally swiftly arranged through her request. He didn\u2019t know it would be as swiftly terminated if she made another request.Breaking an engagement with the most prestigious noble family of the empire was not a pleasant matter.But the Emperor didn\u2019t seem to care about such things.Nassar had already envisioned the dreadful future of breaking off the engagement with Philomel.He made up his mind. Yes, they were engaged after all.As long as they didn\u2019t cross that line, there was a high possibility that Philomel would eventually marry him. The hollow engagement felt quite solid in this situation.Even if Philomel didn\u2019t love Nassar, she had to get married for the sake of succession.It didn\u2019t have to be Nassar as the marriage partner, but no other suitable person seemed to exist. Considering their family, appearance, personality, and abilities, there was no one better than Nassar, the top groom candidate of the empire.He believed that if he just held onto his original position, someday he could be by Philomel\u2019s side.It was both arrogance and weakness.And when Philomel unexpectedly disappeared, he regretted his foolishness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 86": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/There Is No Place For FakesCH 86Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe news of Philomel and Nassar\u2019s breakup spread.In truth, it didn\u2019t become a big topic of discussion because it was an ending many people had anticipated. The emperor and the duke had also worked to keep things quiet.Philomel, who had been lying on the bed in the state guest chamber, suddenly sat up.\u2018I can\u2019t stay like this anymore!\u2019She lightly slapped her cheeks. Nassar was Nassar, and she had her own tasks to attend to.Uncovering the truth of the book.And it seemed to be deeply connected to Ellencia\u2019s secret.\u2018Hmm, how did she get her hands on that kind of potion?\u2019According to Cardin, it was a potion that enhanced intelligence and tasted like lemonade.Contrary to Le Guin\u2019s speculation that it was a product for sale, they hadn\u2019t yet found a place that handled such potions.Even after searching through the paths of darkness as well.So, was it a potion personally made by a magician?But that also seemed unlikely. Even if Ellencia, who had been in the palace all along, could encounter a magician, it would be limited to the court magicians.\u2018Lexion discreetly searched the laboratories of other court magicians and found no traces of such a potion\u2026\u2019The information they received from Emilie was also insignificant.Recently, Ellencia has been devoting herself to her studies in order to accumulate knowledge she hasn\u2019t learned before.The results of her studies are unpredictable. Sometimes she excels like a genius, while other times she\u2019s just average.\u201cWell, the cause must be the duration of the potions.\u201dEven though her first potion was stolen, Ellencia continued to drink other potions. It seemed like there were multiple potions from the beginning or that she was receiving a continuous supply.However, strangely enough, according to Emily, who was always by Ellencia\u2019s side, both sides seemed difficult.It wasn\u2019t suitable to secretly store a large quantity of potions, and there wasn\u2019t even an opportunity to regularly receive them from someone else.Philomel, whose mind became tangled, muttered dispiritedly.\u201c\u2026 No, could the potions just appear out of thin air?\u201dThere was truly no doubt about that potion.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I will definitely steal it again!\u201dAlthough Emily declared that, since the first theft, Ellencia seemed to have become more cautious, and there was no opportunity in sight.With her current mindset, Philomel wanted to receive Le Guin\u2019s help and install surveillance or eavesdropping devices in Ellencia\u2019s room. However, if caught, it would become a national issue.Philomel, who was tearing her hair out in frustration, shouted.\u201cAh! For now, let\u2019s put the potions aside!\u201dFor now, they had to explore other avenues.If there was no information coming directly from Ellencia herself, they could ask someone who knew Ellencia well.Of course, the person who knew Ellencia best would be Catherine, as she had raised the Princess for more than a decade.\u201cEllencia has changed.\u201dAnd she also played a role in solidifying Philomel\u2019s suspicions about Ellencia.Catherine, who was imprisoned in the palace dungeon, seemed to have been transferred elsewhere. According to Count Polan, it was said that soon formal visits would be possible.Philomel intended to meet Catherine and ask specifically how, when, and why Ellencia had changed.However, Catherine\u2019s name was heard from a completely unexpected place.Just when Philomel was planning to visit the Count to inquire about the exact timing of Catherine\u2019s visit, a maid named Nancy announced the arrival of a guest.\u201cA gentleman named William Hounds wishes to meet Miss Philomel.\u201dWilliam Hounds?If it was Hounds, it was Catherine\u2019s surname.Could it be Catherine\u2019s family?\u2018Shall I let him in?\u2019Philomel thought for a moment and nodded. She was curious about why Catherine\u2019s family had come.Although Catherine was released from prison and moved to a better environment, she was still guilty of a serious crime.She would never truly obtain freedom in her lifetime.\u2018If they came to find Catherine\u2019s whereabouts, what should I say\u2026\u2019Since leaving their hometown with Ellencia, Catherine had been missing all along. If they were her family, they must have come to Philomel because they were curious about her whereabouts.If she continued to be missing, they might never give up hope that Catherine would return someday.\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t feel inclined to do it, but it\u2019s better to lie and say she\u2019s dead.\u201dHowever, the reason William Hounds, the man who came, was completely different from Philomel\u2019s expectations.[ Southern Palace Reception Room.]The man sitting across from Philomel, crossing his legs, spoke.\u201cOh, you must be Catherine\u2019s daughter. I\u2019m William, Catherine\u2019s older brother. I run a few upper-class establishments.\u201d\u2018Speaking so informally?\u2019Philomel was momentarily taken aback but considered it understandable.If he was Catherine\u2019s brother, he wouldn\u2019t be considered an outsider to her. Uncles could speak casually to their nieces, but\u2026 ugh.\u2018He\u2019s being so rude!\u2019Ignoring Philomel\u2019s visible irritation, William openly looked around the reception room and whistled.\u201cWow, Philomel, you\u2019re living it up.\u201dPhilomel brought a teacup to her lips and decided not to comment about his rude behavior.Ignoring her, William continued to chatter on.\u201cA state guest of the royal family and the former Imperial Princess, huh? Haha, I never expected someone from our family to be doing so well! When Catherine left her position as a lady-in-waiting to the Empress, I thought the connection to the royal family was over.\u201dPhilomel felt a slight disappointment as she looked at the man claiming to be her uncle.\u2018This person\u2026 seems to care less about his younger sister than a rock by the side road.\u2019The Hounds Upper-Class establishments that the man mentioned is based in the capital.\u2018Meaning, if he intended to meet me, he could have come sooner.\u2019The fact that Philomel was Catherine\u2019s daughter and her presence in this place had already been known for several weeks.But it was obvious why William had come to the palace at this particular time.To assess whether his niece could be to any use to him.As expected, after rambling on with irrelevant remarks, William finally got to the point.\u201c\u2026 So, Uncle has something to ask of you, niece.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cFirst, take a look at this.\u201dWilliam took out something from the high-quality leather bag he had brought and handed it to Philomel. The soft texture of the fabric tickled her hand.It was a translucent material that sparkled beautifully when touched by sunlight.\u201c\u2026 Fairy-wing fabric?\u201dWilliam flicked his finger and made a \u2018click\u2019 sound.\u201cJust as I expected! Since you grew up in the Palace, you can recognize it at a glance! Yes, this is the famous fairy-wing fabric. It\u2019s a fabric woven with real fairy wings mixed into the threads.\u201dHe continued with a tone as if he were a salesperson.\u201cIf you make a dress out of this, it will be absolutely stunning. Just release it on the market. The ladies of high society will go crazy by not being able to purchase it.\u201d\u2018Well, what can you do? It\u2019s illegal to purchase.\u2019Philomel\u2019s cold gaze turned towards William.\u201cAs far as I know, the production and import of fairy-wing fabric are prohibited by imperial law.\u201dWilliam\u2019s expression noticeably faltered.\u201cThat, that\u2019s because of those people who forcibly tear the wings off fairies! Our Upper-Class establishment has obtained proper cooperation from the fairies!Is that really the case?Instead of pressing him for answers, Philomel decided to ask about the reason.\u201cWell, let\u2019s set that aside. Is that why you came to find me?\u201d\u201cNo, the request is secondary. You\u2019re my niece, I came to see\u2026\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to be asking about your younger sister, despite all that. Just tell me what the matter is.\u201dHe spoke with a sullen expression, even though his mouth was slightly twisted.\u201cYou are a smart girl, so I\u2019ll cut to the chase.I need your help with the legalization of the production and distribution of fairy-wing fabric.\u201dAs expected. I knew it would come to that.\u201cWhat power do you think I have to be able to change the law?\u201d\u201cAre you not enjoying the favor of His Majesty the Emperor? Speak well to him. The law was directly proposed by His Majesty, so it needs to win his favor.\u201dPhilomel was well aware of this fact. After all, she was the one who suggested the law to the Emperor. She had learned about the fabric through <Princess Ellencia.>In the book, dresses made of that fabric became a great trend. However, they also caused conflicts with the fairy folk. It was because some people, blinded by money, hunted fairies indiscriminately. And the person who resolved that conflict was the protagonist, Ellencia.\u2018Ellencia might be able to handle it in the future, but by then, numerous fairies would have already been sacrificed.\u2019 Philomel took preventive measures by enacting related laws. It was to prevent tragedies. William seemed visibly frustrated because of that law.Philomel placed the fairy-wing fabric she had been holding on the table.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I can\u2019t offer any help. You can leave now.\u201d\u201cW-What? Why?\u201d\u201cWhy should I do what you\u2019re asking?\u201d\u201cYou are also a member of our family! The prosperity of Hounds Upper-Class establishment brings you prosperity, too!\u201d\u201cNancy, our guest is leaving. Please see him out.\u201dWilliam stretched out his hand and gestured towards the room, shouting angrily.\u201cHow long do you think you can keep up with this attitude? Even if His Majesty has taken a liking to you and will consider your well-being! But his own daughter has appeared, how long do you think that will last? Soon enough, His Majesty will forget about insignificant people like you!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s still advantageous for our family to have you while you\u2019re still receiving his favor! If this matter goes well, I will support you well in the future!\u201dMisunderstanding Philomel\u2019s silence, William spoke condescendingly.\u201cThis is all for your own benefit and mine. You\u2019re still young and don\u2019t know how the world works.Finally, Philomel spoke up.\u201cJeremiah.\u201dJeremiah, who had been waiting behind her all this time, stepped forward.\u201cHmph\u2026!\u201dSeeing his sword, William grabbed the fabric that was on the table and quickly rushed out of the room.Leaving behind his final words.\u201cI\u2019ll give you some time to think about it! I\u2019ll come back later!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Their father\u2019s fondness for Catherine was blinding, and it put him in a state of crisis.If things continued this way, there was a possibility that even the rights of the eldest son, who would inherit the family\u2019s wealth, could be taken away.The moment William emerged from such worries was when his sister entered the palace as a Lady-in-waiting for the Empress.\u201cYou will bring honor to our family!\u201dTheir father was delighted.William was also happy. If Catherine married a suitable nobleman through the Empress\u2019s introduction, the Hounds\u2019 family would have a stepping stone to enter high society.As Lady Catherine, she would be too busy taking care of her husband\u2019s family, so the Hounds Upper-Class establishment\u00a0 naturally belonged to him.All he had to do was carry the support of his then-lady sister on his back and find a footing for the Upper-Class establishment in high society!But William\u2019s hope was shattered in an instant.\u201cFather! Brother! \u2026 I, I can\u2019t stay there anymore.\u201dCatherine had returned to her hometown, leaving the palace on her own accord.No matter how hard their father tried to coax her, Catherine remained silent as a rock.She even met some unknown rascal and became pregnant.In a fit of rage, the father left his daughter behind and moved to the capital.In fact, by the time Catherine entered the palace, he had already made plans to raise his status in the capital.From that day on, Catherine was nonexistent in the Hounds family.Curious about her whereabouts, he sent someone to inquire and learned that Catherine had disappeared around the time of the Empress\u2019s death.Since then, there has been no news. William completely forgot about his sister, until he discovered the truth that Princess Philomel was actually Catherine\u2019s daughter.The news that Catherine had switched her daughter with the Empress\u2019s daughter terrified William.\u201cShe\u2019s deliberately trying to kill us!\u201dWith such a serious crime, the Palace wouldn\u2019t turn a blind eye even to the sinner\u2019s family. He couldn\u2019t be tied to Catherine in any way.\u201cI\u2019ve worked hard to raise our status!\u201dHe quickly prepared the necessary funds and made arrangements to escape to a foreign country.If he hadn\u2019t seen the notice correcting the false rumor, he and his family would have been across the sea by now.\u201cCatherine\u2019s daughter is receiving distinguished treatment in the Palace?\u201dHe smiled with desire.This was an opportunity. A chance to further elevate the Hounds Upper-Class establishment!But reality wasn\u2019t as kind to him. He was driven away by Catherine\u2019s daughter without giving him a chance.And it was a humiliating situation.\u201cDamn it! Arrogant woman!\u201dIn his anger, William kicked a stone on the roadside, realizing that this was the palace, he looked around.To calm himself, he straightened his cravat, and a sense of composure came to his face.\u201cYeah, your arrogance is just temporary. You will come crawling back to me, begging for help for sure someday!\u201dIf he thought about it for a moment, Philomel would also realize that it would be more advantageous for her to join forces with him in the long run.Now that he had become one of the influential figures in the capital, the support of the Hounds, which held power in the capital, would be a tempting prey for her.And if that wretched girl took the bait\u2026 well,\u201cYou can enjoy the benefits and be discarded once your usefulness is gone, Philomel.\u201dWilliam unintentionally revealed his true intentions.That\u2019s right. He never had any intention of taking responsibility for his disliked sister\u2019s daughter from the beginning.Rustle.\u201cW-who\u2019s there?\u201dStartled by the voice from behind, he shouted. It would be awkward for someone to have overheard what he just said.\u201cMeow.\u201dRecognizing the source of the sound, he let out a sigh of relief.\u201cOh, it\u2019s just a cat.\u201dAfter William left, Le Guin approached Philomel, who was lingering in the reception room.\u201cPh-Ph-Phil.\u201dPhilomel, leisurely sipping her remaining tea, responded.\u201cYes, Le Guin, I\u2019m here, so you can call me anytime.\u201d\u201cSome guy was cursing at you just now.\u201d\u201cWilliam, that guy.\u201dLe Guin showed a mischievous smile.\u201cI roughly heard it from Jeremiah. You don\u2019t like that guy either, right?\u201d\u201cWell, I don\u2019t particularly like him.\u201d\u201cShould I kill him? It would be good if that guy died, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Le Guin, you often say scary things. Just because someone does something unpleasant, it doesn\u2019t mean they deserve to die. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d\u201cHuh? Is that so?\u201d\u201cEven Le Guin just talks like that. You wouldn\u2019t just go around killing people because you slightly dislike them. Right?\u201d\u201cUhh, yeah. That\u2019s right\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t kill anyone just because I don\u2019t like them . Yeah, it was just a casual remark! Hahaha\u2026\u201dIt bothered Philomel how long Le Guin took to response and how awkward it sounded.Still, Philomel didn\u2019t doubt him. Because it was something that couldn\u2019t easily happen in her common sense.Le Guin, who was observing the situation, spoke.\u201c\u2026 So you\u2019re just going to let that guy who insulted you go?\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s not because he insulted me, but I won\u2019t just let him go.\u201d\u201cWhat are you going to do then? Hit him?\u201d\u201c\u2026 No, I won\u2019t hit him.\u201dPhilomel calmly informed her confused father.\u201cWe\u2019ll deal with him legally.\u201d\u201cHow?\u201dJeremiah asked curious about what his sister was planning.Philomel smiled mischievously.\u201cYou already said it yourself. He engages in illegal activities.\u201dHe even showed evidence of the fairy-wing fabric.William thought of stupid excuses when confronted with her argument.\u201cEstablishing a cooperation with fairies to obtain fairy wings? What a laughable idea.\u201dTo do so, he would have to receive the wings of fairies that had already died or the discarded old wings that naturally fell off when fairies grew new ones.How much would those wings cost?Those wings alone would be far from enough to meet the demand for fairy-wing fabric.William definitely had a lot of weak spots.Philomel stood up from her seat.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201dLe Guin asked, and she confidently replied.\u201cI\u2019m going to report the illegal activities as a righteous citizen.\u201dAdminister the iron rod of the law.The production and distribution of fairy-wing fabric were crimes punishable by the death penalty.[Capital City, Central Security Bureau.]There was a special guest at the department responsible for commercial crimes.Philomel slammed the desk.\u201cI saw it clearly! William Hounds possesses fairy-wing fabric.\u201dThe investigator in charge of illegal goods responded indifferently.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but we can\u2019t investigate Hounds based solely on such allegations.\u201d\u201cWhy not? The production and distribution of fairy-wing fabric are crimes.\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t assert that the fabric he had was specifically fairy wing fabric. There\u2019s also the possibility that Miss Philomel has mistook-\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re treating me like a fool.\u201dThe investigator nervously stroked his mustache.\u201cThat, that\u2019s not it\u2026 Just having fairy wing fabric is not evidence of committing a crime.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cOnly the production and distribution of fairy wing fabric are illegal, mere possession is not.\u201d\u201cHe openly admitted to being involved in distribution in front of me. There\u2019s a high probability he was involved in production as well.\u201d\u201cJust because he admitted to being involved in distribution doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s actually engaging in it, and production is an unknown area. We could end up arresting innocent people.\u201dIt was a clear fallacy.The fairy-wing fabric was still being traded secretly. It hadn\u2019t been well detected if there were routes exclusive to the criminals.And amidst all this, the owner of a prominent upper-class household was requesting a change in the law and seeking favor from the Emperor\u2019s confidant by admitting to being involved in distribution?It was undoubtedly William\u2019s misconduct.A responsible investigator would not display such irresponsible behavior.Philomel had a gut feeling.\u2018This bastard took a bribe.\u2019When you think about it, isn\u2019t it strange not to bribe those involved in the regulation of illegal activities directly?She had overestimated herself.Instead, the investigator began to gently pacify her.\u201cPlease don\u2019t think that way. Isn\u2019t William Hounds related to Lady Philomel by blood? Is there any need for family members to embarrass each other?\u201dPhilomel spoke in a low voice.\u201cYou have no intention of at least investigating, do you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. We are short-staffed, so it seems difficult.\u201dThe investigator said that, but he had been playing cards with his colleagues before Philomel arrived.\u201cUnderstood. I will come again later.\u201dPhilomel left the department responsible for commercial crimes.The investigator who confirmed that wiped his chest. He let out a sigh of relief.\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of coming again later? It\u2019s not like it\u2019ll make any difference.\u201dEven though he muttered to himself, the investigator\u2019s expression remained grim.She may be a commoner, but that woman receives preferential treatment from the royal family.\u201cThere\u2019s no harm in being cautious.\u201dHe wanted to quickly go to William and inform him of the situation.Just in case, he wanted him to dispose of any relevant evidence and move the hidden fairy wing fabric to another place.And in return, he would obtain more valuable goods and go to the casino. Hehe, the investigator who laughed was about to leave the office.As the door opened, Philomel revealed herself again.\u201cOh, why are you back\u2026?\u201dShe smiled cheerfully in front of the bewildered investigator.\u201cI said I would come back.\u201dAnd then, the Chief of the Central Security Department appeared from behind, wearing a contemplative expression.\u201cI heard Miss Philomel\u2019s words. What\u2026 exactly are you up to?\u201d\u201cWhat? What did I do to make you say that\u2026?\u201d\u201cWeren\u2019t you withholding information about a prime suspect? And there\u2019s even evidence that you received a bribe!\u201d\u201cT-That\u2019s\u2026 a misunderstanding!\u201dPhilomel thoroughly enjoyed watching the trembling investigator\u2019s attempts to explain himself to the Chief.\u2018I didn\u2019t know I could throw him under the bus like that.\u2019Philomel played a significant role in moving the Chief of the Central Security Department, thanks to the influence of Count Polan.Initially, even he was lukewarm to Philomel\u2019s opinion.\u201cI don\u2019t think my friend would do something like that\u2026\u201dIt was a typical way of protecting one\u2019s own family.However, when Philomel borrowed his communication device to contact the Emperor\u2019s secretary, his attitude completely changed.Indeed, networking was something to be reckoned with. Although personal connections shouldn\u2019t have influenced official duties\u2026 Philomel quietly spoke, as if justifying herself.\u201cI tried to follow the procedure, but I had no choice.\u201dIn the end, the investigator confessed, under intense interrogation, that he had received bribes from William and turned a blind eye to the distribution of fairy-wing fabric.Immediately, police officers stormed the buildings owned by the Hounds Upper Class establishment throughout the capital.Everything unfolded within the day Philomel met William for the first time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Fortunately, there were no security guards present.This place was a warehouse that was secretly managed by the Hounds family.It seemed that the security forces were unaware of its existence, as the owner\u2019s name was registered under someone else.\u201cDamn it!\u201dFurious to the core, William angrily punched the box in front of him. He had narrowly escaped by using his subordinates as decoys.How did things get so messed up?\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201dThe security forces were convinced that the Hounds upper-class establishment had committed illegal activities. Furthermore, they had directly mentioned the fairy wings.\u201cObviously, the information got leaked. Who could have done it?\u201dThe face of the corrupt investigator, whom he had bribed, came to William\u2019s mind. It couldn\u2019t have been him.The bribe William had given him amounted to a year\u2019s salary for that man. He was not the type to give up a bribe easily.Then, the faces of those who knew about his plan to smuggle fairy wings crossed William\u2019s mind, one by one.\u201cOf course, it couldn\u2019t be family members, and the employees have a low possibility\u2026\u201dThat left only one person.The person who he had shown the fairy wings personally today.\u201cPhilomel, you wretched women!\u201dThat idiot has gone and caused trouble. Putting not only herself but the entire family at risk.\u201cSuch ungratefulness!\u201dHe kicked the object in front of him again with his golden foot.Thud\u2014!\u201cAaargh!\u201dWith a pained scream, he clutched his foot and rolled in excruciating agony. It seemed like he had kicked something extremely firm.After a while, William stood up and swore resolutely.\u201cI will definitely kill her!\u201dFor now, he had no choice but to retreat, but once the situation calmed down, he planned to come back here.William smiled wickedly as he examined the dark interior of the warehouse.\u201cHehe, with these alone, I\u2019ll be able to make a comeback like nothing happened.\u201dThis warehouse was where he stored his hidden treasures.\u201cI\u2019ll take these and head to Beleroph. The remaining family members and the upper-class establishment will suffer, but the most important thing is for me to survive for now. They will surely understand.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s so dark here.\u201dHe felt around the shelf next to the entrance. The lamp should have been around here.Found it.He took out the matches from his pocket and lit the lamp. The faint light illuminated the dim interior.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201dHe was able to see the object he had just kicked. It was William\u2019s head. More precisely, a head made of stone, resembling William.He immediately realized its identity. It was the head part of a statue made in his likeness.The head of the statue was rolling on the floor, detached from its body.It had been a hollow statue specially made to conceal smuggled goods and made transporting them easier. It had been kept in the warehouse at William\u2019s request.\u201cW-What is this?\u201dCold sweat gathered on the back of his neck.Someone was here.William hastily ran towards the location of the vault.That was the moment.\u201cLooking for this?\u201dWith a clear voice, a bright light illuminated the whole warehouse.Blinded by the light, William instinctively covered his face. After a while, as his eyes adjusted to the light\u2026\u201cWe meet again.\u201dPhilomel was there.And she was sitting on top of the vault he had desperately searched for.Without even considering how she had gotten here, William shouted at her.\u201cMove aside! You arrogant brat\u2026\u201d He suddenly realized one fact.Philomel was alone.He didn\u2019t need to wait for a long time to give her the punishment she deserved for what happened today.In such a desperate situation, he couldn\u2019t even fathom the thought that Philomel would be the one who seeks him out first.Just as he was about to rush towards her,Thud-!An object swiftly passed by his face, causing an injury where blood began to trickle from his cheek.Slowly turning his head, he looked at the object that had made a loud noise as it collided with the wall.It was the right hand of the statue.\u201cOh, I missed.\u201dThe silver-haired man holding a metal rod calmly spoke.\u201cBut it was still a nice shot.\u201dThe red-haired man next to him placed a stone on the ground. Upon closer inspection, it was the chest part of the statue.\u201cThis time, I\u2019ll aim better\u2026\u201dThe silver-haired man raised his rod towards the statue fragment.\u201cWow-wow-waaah!\u201dSoon, countless fragments of the statue flew towards William.After a while.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry. Please\u2026please give me a break.\u201dPhilomel stared at the man hanging in the air, bound by ropes. His once lively face was now covered in bruises, swollen and pitiful.\u2018He was supposed to live a good life\u2026\u2019Initially, Philomel\u00a0 had no intention of getting directly involved to this extent. She had planned to report William to the authorities and be done with it, but her feelings changed during the course of the events.Since she had started this, she wanted to see it through to the end.There was also the fact that William had not been caught by the authorities and had escaped. She couldn\u2019t leave loose ends behind.Above all, she had encountered \u2018him.\u2019Shortly after leaving the central security office, Philomel was arranged to meet \u2018him\u2019 by Le Guin\u2019s arrangement. He requested Philomel\u2019s help.She couldn\u2019t refuse that request\u2026\u201cB-But, how. How do you know about this place?\u201dPhilomel snapped out of her thoughts at William\u2019s voice.In response to the abrupt change in his tone after experiencing violence, Philomel answered him with politeness.\u201cI have my ways.\u201dThe truth was that it was thanks to the tracking magic Le Guin had placed on him. When he witnessed William in the form of a cat at the palace, he attached it just in case.\u2018I suppose it\u2019s about time I lend a helping hand, since then.\u2019Anyway, Le Guin and Jeremiah followed Philomel, so they came here together.Lexion contacted Jeremiah about another matter and followed along after hearing the story, finding it interesting.Jeremiah murmured as he stabbed William with a sword.\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just kill him here?\u201d\u201cHee-hee-hee!\u201dWilliam made a strange noise and wriggled to avoid the sword.Lexion opened each wooden box that was in the warehouse.\u201cOh, there are quite valuable items here. Let\u2019s take them with us.\u201dFrom violence to theft. They were a bunch of villains without any redeeming qualities. And now, Philomel was also part of that gang of villains.Just when Philomel was starting to feel distant from her past, William shouted.\u201cPhilomel! Ugh!\u201dAfter almost getting cut by Jeremiah\u2019s sword, he changed his address.\u201cM- Miss Philomel.\u201dPhilemon gently raised her hand to stop Jeremiah.\u201cSpeak, uncle.\u201d\u201cPlease, release me! I\u2019m Catherine\u2019s brother, aren\u2019t I? Even if you just let me see her face\u2026\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, I don\u2019t have that kind of loyalty to my uncle. Even, I am not kind enough to release someone who wants to kill me.\u201dThe man\u2019s face, like a blank sheet of paper, turned pale at the self-talk he had just remembered.\u201cI\u2019m sorry! I lost my composure and said thoughtless things!\u201d\u201cYou seem fine.\u201d\u201cIf you release me, I will give you 20% of my entire fortune!\u201d\u201cOnly 20%?\u201d\u201c50%!\u201d\u201cNot necessary.\u201d\u201cArgh, I\u2019ll give you everything!\u201d\u201cMy wealth is much greater than that, so I\u2019ll decline.\u201d\u201cLies!\u201dIt was true. The fortune Philemon received from Eustis was at least ten times the net worth of Hound\u2019s Upper-class establishment.Despite its seemingly favorable appearance, Hound\u2019s Upper-Class establishment had been plagued by chronic management difficulties. Philemon had discovered this fact while reading the establishment\u2019s records while waiting for William.The decline of Hound\u2019s Upper Estate had started about ten years ago. It was the year when the previous estate owner passed away, and William took over the business.\u2018So, he must have been frustrated with the troublesome fairy wing trade.\u2019In short, William Hounds was a human with no virtue or ability in a delicate and problematic business.No matter what persuasion he attempted, Philemon showed no sign of wavering, so he shouted.\u201cFine! Do as you wish! Hand me over to the authorities! But even if my sister manages to survive, that\u2019s it!\u201dThere was a reason why William shouted so loudly.The maximum penalty he would receive legally was death, but it was rare for someone to actually receive the death penalty.Because the beings that suffer from fairy-wing fabric are fairies, not humans.If William were to be handed over to the authorities, he would likely receive a punishment ranging from life imprisonment to thirty years in prison.If he bribed the judge well, the sentence could be even lower.William chuckled.\u201cWhen I come out of prison, I\u2019ll come find you again. Then, ugh!\u201dAs Jeremiah kicked the man, blood dripped from his nose and mouth. Jeremiah, with a rather annoyed expression, said,\u201cLet\u2019s just kill him right here.\u201dPhilemon grabbed his shoulder.\u201cHold on. That\u2019s not our job.\u201dShe looked at William.\u201cIt\u2019s not possible for you to go to the police or the empire\u2019s prison.\u201d\u201c\u2026 What? What does that mean\u2026\u201dWhooooosh!At that moment, Le Guin, who had briefly left his position along with a radiant light, arrived.\u201cI brought them.\u201dAnd behind him, a new figure revealed itself.With flowing pink hair, slightly pale skin, and translucent butterfly-shaped wings, a woman overflowing with elegance and enchanting charm spoke.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It took some time to bring all the children who wanted to come along.\u201dA voice that penetrated the ears like wind chimes. It was the same person Philomel had met before.It was the Fairy Queen, Seraphine.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

These are the fabric made from my children\u2019s bodies.\u201dThe small fairies by her side also cried softly.At the queen\u2019s gesture, the boxes containing the fabric floated in the air.\u201cWe will take these. We plan to bury them next to the graves of the deceased.\u201dTwo pupils resembling the night sky filled with stars turned towards William. The air vibrated with her anger.\u201cUgh\u2026 No, I don\u2019t want to! Let me go!\u201dWilliam struggled with all his might, but it was futile to try to free himself from the ropes.Seraphine flew towards him like flowing water.Her beautiful and cold hand touched the man\u2019s face.With a voice colder than her hand, the queen spoke.\u201cYou have to come with us.\u201dHe cried out, sensing the future that would unfold if he went with them.\u201cNo, I refuse! I am a citizen of the Belerove Empire! Even if I receive punishment, it will be in my homeland!\u201dSeraphine smiled, even to the point of enchantment.\u201cWhy should someone who committed a crime against our people on our land receive punishment here?\u201dShe gently patted the man\u2019s face.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I don\u2019t plan to kill you right away. I want you to experience the pain of our kin who were tormented and killed with their wings plucked while still alive.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t do it! It was the hunters! You know that too!\u201d\u201cWhat a foolish excuse. You were the one who provided information to those hunters.\u201d\u201cThat, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cThe process of paying the price won\u2019t be lonely. The hunters are also waiting for you in our land.\u201d\u201cI refuse! I won\u2019t go!\u201dWilliam pleaded for Philomel\u2019s help.\u201cPhilomel, please help me!\u201dHowever, she had nothing she could do or wanted to do for his sake.The enraged little fairies clung to William one by one.Surrounded by the fairies, he screamed, but soon fell silent.That was a fitting end for William Hounds.Before leaving, Seraphine expressed her gratitude to Philomel.\u201cThank you. With this, I can face my fallen comrades in my homeland.\u201dPhilomel replied awkwardly, \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t done anything.\u201d\u201cNot at all. If it weren\u2019t for you, would the Mage have revealed this man\u2019s existence to us?\u201dShe brushed her hand over the unconscious William lying on the ground.He wasn\u2019t dead. He was merely unconscious from the fairy dust. Considering the future that lay ahead, it might have been better if he were dead.Seraphine\u00a0 looked at Le Guin.\u201cI didn\u2019t know you had such an adorable daughter.\u201dPhilomel, feeling embarrassed, reached out her hand.\u201cJust adorable, that\u2019s all.\u201dTo receive such praise from the fairy queen, who possessed beauty to captivate even the same gender, was embarrassing.Seraphine smiled and held Philomel\u2019s hands.\u201cYou\u2019re not only adorable, but you are also kind and compassionate.\u201d\u201cYour praise is too much.\u201d\u201cNot at all. It was you who first conceived the idea of a law banning fairy-wing fabric for our sake, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201c\u2026 How did you know?\u201d\u201cI heard it from your other father.\u201dThe Emperor?\u201cI met him at the species conference held every three years at the World Tree. He was usually reserved, but at that time, he was unusually\u2026\u201dSeraphine\u2019s story was interrupted by Le Guin\u2019s interjection.\u201cWhat \u2018other father\u2019? You, go away! If you\u2019re going to say useless things to someone else\u2019s daughter, leave quickly!\u201dSeraphine\u00a0 playfully stuck out her tongue.\u201cHow pitiful to see a man\u2019s jealousy.\u201d\u201cWhat? I called her for no reason.\u201d\u201cHehe, anyway, you\u2019re adorable, Philomel!\u201dShe slightly floated up and brought her face close to Philomel\u2019s.And\u2026 smooch!She kissed Philomel\u2019s forehead. Warmth spread where her tender lips touched.Seraphine shouted,\u201cTo the one who saved countless of our kin from danger, and brought solace to the children who died in pain without being able to close their eyes!\u201dA gentle warmth seemed to spread throughout Philomel\u2019s entire body.\u201cI bestow upon you the protection of the fairies! May a bright future unfold before you. And also, a title.\u201dFollowing the queen, the little fairies also took flight. William, who had passed out, was the same.A long journey back to their homeland.Despite being able to return in an instant with Le Guin\u2019s power, they chose the lengthy flight. It was to be a journey honoring the rest of the deceased.And so, Seraphine and the little fairies departed.Le Guin looked at his sons and daughter and said,\u201cLet\u2019s go back, too.\u201dPhilomel had one question.\u201cBut why did you contact Queen Seraphine? It didn\u2019t seem like you were particularly close, from what I heard about her.\u201d\u201cYou said so.\u201dCompassion and Affection\u201cIt\u2019s said that you shouldn\u2019t kill people to an unpleasant extent.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cIn that case, you can let those who despise him enough to want him dead know.\u201d\u201cSo, the fairies\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes. You didn\u2019t stop them from what they were doing, either.\u201dHow could she appease the deep resentment embedded in their bones? She didn\u2019t want to, nor did she try to.Rather, when Seraphine, who restrained her sadness and anger, asked for her help, she only felt a desire to assist.Philomel believed that it was the minimum duty she, as someone who shared kinship and the same species as William, who committed unforgivable sins, should uphold.Le Guin smiled and said,\u201cThe wind is getting cold. Let\u2019s go back.\u201dPhilomel gazed at his back.\u2018Honestly, I still don\u2019t know exactly what kind of person he is\u2026\u2019Moreover, what he just said could be interpreted as using the fairies to eliminate William simply because he wanted him dead.Recalling the image of him she had seen so far, Philomel lowered her head.\u2018Well, it couldn\u2019t be just that, right? He must have had a sense of justice.\u2019Considering that he helped the fairies seek revenge in the end, he seemed like a decent person after all.\u201cLet\u2019s go together!\u201dPhilomel walked alongside Le Guin toward where her two brothers were.[The next day, in the reception room of the royal palace.]Philomel was meeting a new guest, just like the emissary William had sought.Philomel opened her mouth.\u201cSo, you\u2019re the lawyer, Mr. White?\u201dA middle-aged man with slicked-back hair neatly answered, \u201cYes, yes. That\u2019s correct. It is an honor to meet Miss Philomel.\u201dHis attitude was polite to the point of seeming somewhat obsequious.\u201cAs the head counsel of Hounds, Mr. White, what brings you to see me?\u201dWith a hidden sense of embarrassment, Philomel asked in a graceful manner.\u2018Could it be that he knows about my involvement in the downfall of the Hounds upper-class establishment and has come to claim damages or something\u2026?\u2019[Hound\u2019s Upper-class establishment Collapsed Overnight! Upper- class establishment Owner, William Hounds, Fleeing the Country?]That was the headline prominently featured in today\u2019s morning newspaper.Most of the fairy wings were taken away by the fairies themselves, but the hidden stock that the establishment secretly planned to sell was discovered by the security forces.Evidence of their ongoing transactions was also found. Not only that, but the upper-class establishment of Hounds were involved in various illegal activities, big and small.Tax evasion, collusion, bribery, and more.Of course, it was also revealed in detail how William manipulated the books to conceal the difficult situation of the establishment.The downfall of Hounds was just a matter of time. And it was during this time that this lawyer named White came to see Philomel.White wiped his hands and spoke, \u201cI have come to offer Lady Philomel a good proposal.\u201d\u201cPlease go ahead and tell me.\u201d\u201cWell, this is a secret that only Mr. William and I know.\u201dThe lawyer\u2019s voice suddenly became quieter.\u201cLady Philomel, you also have the right to inherit Hounds\u2019 assets.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Pardon?\u201d\u201cI am the head counsel of the upper-class establishment, but I have also handled the private affairs of the Hounds family.\u201d\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cWilliam\u2019s father, who is Miss Philomel\u2019s grandfather and the previous head of the Hounds family, left a will when he was still alive. He stated that he would leave half of the estate to his missing daughter, Catherine!\u201d\u201c\u2026 But I know that the inherited fortune didn\u2019t come back to my mother.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s because that wicked man, William, or rather that scoundrel, manipulated the will and seized the estate for himself!\u201d\u201c\u2026 I see.\u201dWhite stiffened his expression and pretended to wipe away tears.\u201cWhen the old man was about to die, he even uttered nonsense that I couldn\u2019t bear to hear!\u201d\u201cThat scoundrel manipulated me, who was in charge of the will, and made it seem like there was no will at all. So, naturally, all the assets would go to him, the only surviving child.\u201d\u201cSo, you cooperated with William\u2019s scheme?\u201dHe took out a handkerchief and pretended to wipe away tears.\u201cSob\u2026 I tried not to, but\u2026 I needed money for the medical expenses of my sick grandmother\u2026 In the end, I got involved in the fraud and pretended to be a victim.\u201dAfter taking a sip of tea, Philomel asked in a businesslike manner, \u201cI see. I learned something new. But why did you come to see me?\u201dThe lawyer\u2019s gaze changed. It seemed like this was where the main point would be addressed.\u201cI simply can\u2019t violate my conscience any longer! Since we have no way of finding Catherine\u2019s whereabouts, Miss, you may also be able to exercise your mother\u2019s rights.\u201dHe spoke fervently.\u201cI still have that will. If I submit it as evidence in a lawsuit, it could be a significant help in recovering Miss Philomel\u2019s share.\u201d\u201cAre you offering to help me without any compensation?\u201d\u201cYes? Well, if you just show some appreciation for my efforts, I won\u2019t ask for anything else\u2026 In short, if you want the will, pay me the money.\u201dPhilomel let out a hollow laugh.\u201cIs it a trend these days for people to come to me with strange demands?\u201dSurely this lawyer has been extorting money from William all this time. Threatening to expose the will if he doesn\u2019t pay.Since William turned him down, now he has come to her.White wiped the sweat from his face with a handkerchief.\u201cMiss, you need to make a decision quickly. If we continue like this, William and his family can drain all the assets.\u201dHe must have weighed William\u2019s family against Philomel. Which side can offer him more money?Since the prospects for the upper-class establishment\u2019s recovery are bleak, he turned to Philomel. His family is destined to become penniless.Philomel crossed her arms.\u201cMr. White, don\u2019t you have the \u2018real\u2019 intention to follow your conscience without taking a single penny?\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s a bit\u2026 um, I also have my livelihood to consider, haha\u2026 Oh, Miss, I didn\u2019t expect you to be so\u2026 not as generous as I thought\u2026\u201dJeremiah, who was standing behind, asked, \u201cWhat should we do? Should we follow some kind of procedure again?\u201dPhilomel pondered.\u201cA procedure\u2026?\u201dShe remembered what happened yesterday.\u201cI went to the Central Security Bureau and had a wrestling match with a corrupt investigator. If we follow the procedure this time, I\u2019ll have to go to the Central Security Bureau again\u2026\u201dPhilomel let out a sigh.\u201cI\u2019m tired. I\u2019ll leave it to you, Jeremiah.\u201dWith a sword in hand, he took a step, then another step towards the lawyer.White pressed himself against the backrest of his chair.\u201cWhy, why are you doing this? If you cause any harm to me, I will demand substantial compensation later\u2026 Agh!\u201dThe lawyer\u2019s screams echoed, but there was no one to come to his aid.Since Philomel\u2019s attendants rarely approached her unless there was a special reason or outside the designated time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 90": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/There Is No Place For FakesCH 90Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOn the same day, in the afternoon.For some reason, lawyer White appeared in front of the city hall with bruises on his face.\u201cTen years ago, I committed a mistake that blinded me to everything but money!\u201dHis subsequent declaration of conscience was quite shocking.The lawyer immediately revealed a new issue regarding the Hounds\u2019 upper establishment, who had become the talk of the town today.Furthermore, he announced that he would personally engage in a legal battle on behalf of Catherine Hounds. Of course, without compensation.The lawsuit hadn\u2019t even started, but the outcome was as clear as day.The client who commissioned White was none other than Miss Philomel, the honorable guest of the royal family.Her entitled share was half of the Hounds\u2019 family\u2019s assets, based on the time of the noble\u2019s death.Considering the drastically reduced state of the Hounds\u2019 wealth compared to back then, it was barely enough for William and his family to scrape by.The upper establishment of the Hounds\u2019 family were now practically Philomel\u2019s.Philomel was sitting in the Southern Palace, looking at documents with a serious expression.\u201cHmm.\u201dSeveral days had passed since William\u2019s visit. She had been reviewing documents related to the Hounds\u2019 upper establishment for several days now.The day after White\u2019s visit, a person who claimed to be the temporary head of the Hounds\u2019 upper establishment came to see Philomel.He was younger than expected. It was revealed that high-ranking employees who had been involved in William\u2019s illegal activities had been mostly arrested.He bowed her head and pleaded with Philomel.\u201cPlease, Miss Philomel, take a look at these documents!\u201dSeeing Philomel hesitate, he almost begged.\u201cThere is no one else but you, Miss, who can save our distressed upper establishment!\u201dThe lawsuit was still ongoing, but they already saw her as the new head.\u201cNot surprising at all. If I become the head, there will be some risk of the upper establishment\u2019s downfall.\u201dThe image of the Hounds\u2019 upper establishment had hit rock bottom due to all sorts of illegal activities.The central security forces were meticulously investigating any wrongdoing, and their business partners were gradually severing ties.Who would dare to meddle with the upper establishment owned by the honorable guest of the royal family? The temporary head explained that their prediction stopped at this point, assuming Philomel would become the new owner.\u201cIf you are confirmed as the head, the situation will improve even more! Please, become the owner of the Hounds!\u201dHis\u00a0 eyes looked so desperate that, without realizing it, Philomel ended up accepting the documents\u2026Philomel let out a sigh.\u201cI have no interest in the upper establishment!\u201dOn the opposite side, Le Guin, who was resting his chin on his hand, asked.\u201cThen why did you file a lawsuit? You could have just ignored that lawyer, even if you didn\u2019t like him.\u201d\u201cTo be honest, I had planned to give William\u2019s assets to the fairies. It was a way to compensate them for the damages they suffered, even if only a little\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, so that\u2019s what you meant when you asked me to connect you with the Fairy Queen a while ago.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. But Seraphine refused.\u201dShe spoke in a clear voice.\u201cWe\u2019ll just take your goodwill. Human money is of no use to us. Just go, cute Philomel.\u201dLe Guin said.\u201cStill, you have a conscience. Phil, if that\u2019s what you want, go for it. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to become the head at a time like this.\u201d\u201cDo you think I\u2019m capable of that?\u201d\u201cWhy not? You can definitely do it. I\u2019ll push you forward.\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026\u201dIf there was support from the mage tower, she could even aim for the top position on the continent.The problem was that she wasn\u2019t interested in it at all.Her main purpose was to uncover the truth of the book, and she had sufficient wealth.And above all\u2026 it was bothersome!Recently, Philomel\u2019s life had become overwhelmingly idle in no time.Until just a season ago, she had lived a busy life as the Emperor\u2019s successor, never getting a moment\u2019s rest.At first, this leisure felt awkward, but now she had grown accustomed to it.\u201cAh, should I just drop the lawsuit and let William\u2019s family have it?\u201dBut even that didn\u2019t appeal to her. The head position clearly belonged to Catherine.\u201cMeow.\u201dWhile Philomel was lost in her own thoughts, Le Guin turned into a cat. He usually did so when someone else came to visit at times like this.Suddenly, Nancy, who had entered the support role, informed her.\u201cMiss Philomel, Count Polan has arrived.\u201dPhilomel and Count Polan met in the reception room. The Count, who saw the documents spread out on the table for a brief moment, cheerfully said, \u201cCongratulations.\u201d\u201dWhat were they congratulating\u2026?\u201c Don\u2019t worry. I will spread the word that what\u2019s good is good.\u201dIt seemed that he naturally assumed Philomel would become the new owner of Hounds\u2019 Head.Philomel felt a sense of burden, but diligently organized the documents. She had a fundamentally diligent and conscientious personality.After exchanging small talk with Philomel, the Count brought up the underlying reason for his visit.\u201cVisiting Catherine is now possible. She is currently in the Eastern Tower. Would you like to meet her now?\u201d\u2018Finally,\u2019 Philomel thought as she nodded her head. It was time to meet her once again.The Eastern Tower.It referred to a long tower with an intuitive name, located in the eastern part of the palace grounds.It was a place where the Emperor had placed people he didn\u2019t want to be seen in the world for various reasons.There were emperors who imprisoned their disobedient selves and emperors who imprisoned their rebellious children.And the current Emperor, Eustis, had confined Catherine here, who was his wife\u2019s friend and the surrogate mother of his daughter\u2026 In any case, Catherine had a complicated relationship with them.Philomel climbed the long staircase of the tower, panting.\u201c\u2026Damn, it\u2019s high.\u201dThen, she exclaimed in surprise at what she just said.\u201cDamn\u2026 Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019ve been with Le Guin and Jeremiah for a longer period now. My language has become vulgar, even in my own thoughts.\u201dTo be honest, even to herself, phrases like \u201cdamn\u201d or \u201cdamn high\u201d felt lacking in refinement.\u201cI need to be careful.\u201dShe couldn\u2019t become like those two.But at some point, Philomel\u2019s breathing became easier. Her body was filled with energy.\u201cMeow, meow.\u201dLe Guin, who was following behind in his cat form, seemed to have cast the strengthening magic on her body, just like before.Philomel looked at his firm buttocks passing by and thought to herself, \u2018In times like this, having a convenient magic kit is great.\u2019Before long, the two reached the top floor of the tower.A guard stood in front of the door and saluted with a show of strength.\u201cMiss Philomel, greetings!\u201dPhilomel spoke up.\u201cI\u2019ve come to see Catherine.\u201d\u201cI heard from Count Polan. Wasn\u2019t it tiring to come all the way up here?\u201d\u201cYes, it was a bit exhausting.\u201dAlthough it wasn\u2019t her fault, the guard quickly apologized.\u201cI\u2019m sorry! I will suggest installing a floating stone!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not necessary to go that far.\u201d\u201cNo! But\u2026 Can the cat come in too?\u201d\u201cIs it not allowed?\u201d\u201cIt might be a bit difficult according to the regulations\u2026\u201dThe guard changed her words when she saw Philomel\u2019s disappointed eyebrows.\u201c\u2026It seems like it should be fine since the cat doesn\u2019t understand human language.\u201d\u201cThank you. Have a good day.\u201dZiik, the door opened, and Philomel entered the room.The furniture in the room was simple. There was a bed and a makeshift desk on the side.And near the door, there was a luxurious chair, meant for the visitors. Philomel sat on that chair.Then, the eyes of the woman sitting on the bed widened in astonishment.\u201c\u2026Pi-Philomel.\u201dPhilomel greeted her mother whom she hadn\u2019t seen in two or three months.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Catherine.\u201dIt was a dry and awkward reunion between the two.Catherine tried to approach her daughter.\u201cHow did you come here? Are you still staying at the palace? Are you doing well?\u201dHowever, with a jolt, the chains attached to her ankles tightened.The chains were adjusted so that they couldn\u2019t reach the person sitting on the chair. It was a device to protect the visitor from any potential attack from her.Catherine was still a prisoner. Even if she was provided with a cleaner and more spacious environment than the palace prison, that was the undeniable truth.\u201cBut still, it\u2019s better to be here than locked up in prison.\u201dAccording to Count Polan, on days without visits, the guards would unlock her chains.Judging by the several books placed on the desk, it seemed like she had some form of entertainment. Furthermore, she had heard that she was allowed to take a stroll in the eastern tower courtyard once a week. Considering she was a substitute mother for the Princess and not some common criminal, her situation was quite favorable.Philomel leaned back against the soft backrest of the chair.\u201cTo answer your question, I am doing well. I\u2019m staying at the palace, and the reason I came here is because I have something to ask you.\u201d\u201cOh, really? I\u2019m glad to hear that you\u2019re doing well! But how did you end up at the palace?\u201dPhilomel briefly explained her circumstances to Catherine.When Philomel mentioned being a guest of the royal family, Catherine nodded her head.\u201cI see. Only I need to bear the punishment. You\u2019ve done well.\u201dPhilomel had always found her mother\u2019s attitude strange. It was as if she sincerely felt sorry for Philomel.\u2018If you\u2019re sorry, you shouldn\u2019t have done such things.\u2019However, Philomel decided not to pour out any negative emotions towards Catherine anymore.That was not important now. Unlike Catherine, who was bound here, Philomel had to move forward.It didn\u2019t mean she forgave her. She just didn\u2019t want to waste her energy on unnecessary matters.Philomel was about to ask a question to Catherine.\u201cSo, there\u2019s something I want to ask you-\u201cBut in an instant, Catherine interrupted her.\u201cI know what it is. It must be what you\u2019re most curious about. I should have told you earlier.\u201d\u2026How did she know that Philomel wanted to ask about Ellencia without even saying it?Philomel furrowed her brows and pondered.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Come to think of it, she still didn\u2019t know that Philomel knew the identity of her biological father.\u201cYour biological father is a person more amazing than you could ever imagine. If you have nowhere else to turn, go find him. He will not ignore you. He is\u2026\u201dPhilomel interrupted her mother before she could speak any longer.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I also know that my real father is the Lord of the Magic Tower.\u201d\u201cHow do you know that!\u201dCatherine opened her mouth in surprise. Philomel talked to the cat that was by the leg of her chair.\u201cYou can return to your original form now. Looking at the thickness of the door, I don\u2019t think they can hear our voices from the outside.\u201dThen, with a popping sound, the cat disappeared and a person appeared in its place.\u201cHi, did you say Catherine? Long time no see.\u201dCatherine was startled.\u201cLe Guin!\u201dPhilomel told Catherine a brief summary of how she came to be with Le Guin.\u201cI don\u2019t know, but\u2026 You\u2019re investigating Ellen because she looks suspicious, right? Le Guin is helping you.\u201dLe Guin snapped his fingers.\u201cYeah, that\u2019s it.\u201dCatherine smiled warmly.\u201cBy the way, Le Guin, it\u2019s been a while. You haven\u2019t aged at all.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the same with you. Your face is the same as before.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t really remember me, do you?\u201d\u201cYeah. That\u2019s right, I just pretended to know.\u201d\u201cYour personality hasn\u2019t changed either.\u201dPhilomel watched them wordlessly. It was a conversation that seemed like it would be shared by neighbors in a neighborhood she hadn\u2019t seen in a long time, rather than a single parent.\u2018Well, I didn\u2019t want something dramatic hidden between the two of them, but somehow I\u2019m feeling down\u2026\u2019The two continued to reminisce for a while.\u201cLe Guin saved me from being chased by a group of monsters near Mount Palos.\u201d\u201cMount Palos\u2026? Ah! You\u2019re the woman who didn\u2019t know how precious her life was.\u201d\u201cAcross the river from there is my hometown.\u201dPhilomel interrupted the new information.\u201cHey, did Le Guin save Catherine?\u201dCatherine replied.\u201cThat\u2019s right. You were really great back then. You killed so many monsters at once\u2026\u201dIf so, wasn\u2019t it a rather romantic first meeting? In the romance novels Philomel read often, the two main characters often met in that way. She looked at her biological mother.\u2018Could it be that Catherine had at least some of her feelings for Le Guin? Even Le Guin left her, so she might be even more obsessed with her old love\u2026\u2019Noticing Philomel\u2019s meaningful gaze, Catherine waved her hand.\u201cNo! I only respected Le Guin, but the truth was nothing like this!\u201d\u201c\u2026is it so?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s real! You don\u2019t have to look at me with such pitiful eyes! In the first place, I\u2019m not interested in men unless they have dark hair\u2026\u201d\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\u201cOh no, that\u2019s\u2026\u201dPhilodel was dumbfounded and fired back.\u201cThis is all because of your terrifying obsession with that black hair.\u201d\u201cOh must! I\u2019ve forgotten him now! It\u2019s just that dark hair is my preference.\u201dA sigh escaped Philomel\u2019s mouth.\u201cIn the first place, liking people just for their hair color\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, Philomel, you probably have at least one hair color that you like.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t do that, just pick one. The guy you\u2019re going to date later on wants his hair to be this color.\u201d\u201cBecause there isn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cThen, whatever color you like.\u201d\u201cOm\u2026 then gold?\u201d\u201cWhat, he\u2019s blonde!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s with that kid! There\u2019s no kid like that!\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to hide it, you\u2019re at an age where I\u2019m sure there\u2019s at least one boy you like.\u201dCatherine said she was a mother who listened to her daughter\u2019s relationship counseling.\u201cWhat are you doing right now? Blonde hair? If you\u2019re going to do it, talk about silver hair.\u201dLe Guin looked back and forth between the two with her pouty eyes.\u2018Oops, I got caught up in Catherine\u2019s pace.\u2019 She seemed to be a much nicer person than expected.In the meantime, she was always in a serious mood with Katrin, so she didn\u2019t know it, but this seems to be her original personality. She had a strange feeling that such a person had committed such a great sin.\u2018No, now is not the time to be sentimental.\u2019She would have to listen to something about Ellencia soon so she didn\u2019t say anything else.\u201cWhat I want to ask is about Ellencia, not my real father.\u201d\u201cAh, Ellen\u2026\u201dCatherine\u2019s face blurred in an instant.\u201cShe must be resentful of me, right? She won\u2019t come here for the rest of her life\u2026\u201dPhilodel noticed from Catherine\u2019s words that Ellencia hadn\u2019t visited the mobile tower yet. Hadn\u2019t much time passed yet? Or maybe not\u2026 Philomel, who was silent for a moment, looked at Catherine and opened her mouth.\u201cYou said Ellensia changed and was like a different person before?\u201dCatherine\u2019s body trembled.\u201cMy, I could be mistaken. It\u2019s nonsense.\u201d\u201cIt could be. Please tell me though. Exactly how Elencia has changed.\u201dPhilomel, of course, never said a word about books to Catherine. Even so, she was well aware of the fact that something unusual was happening to Catherine\u2019s adopted daughter.\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll tell you anything I know.\u201dCatherine gave her a big nod, as if she had made up her mind.\u201cThe first time I felt that Ellen had changed was about three months before you showed up. It was winter.\u201dSitting on her stool, she searched for her memory.\u201cI\u2019m not sure exactly what day it was, but she went out one day and came back and felt a little strange. She came home late in the evening, and she asked me as if she couldn\u2019t even remember my name.\u201dShe didn\u2019t remember Catherine\u2019s name? Could it be? She\u2019s her mother.\u201cI thought Ellen, who had been outside for a long time in the cold weather, was talking nonsense because she had a cold, so I gave her medicine and put her to sleep. The next day, the child was in a daze, and the day after that, and the day after the day after that\u2026\u201dShe continued her speech by touching her own cheek.\u201cThen, one day after a few days, her condition changed a little.\u201dA voice suddenly rose.\u201cShould I say that she suddenly became lively? At first glance, it seemed that she had returned to her former self\u2026 But, subtly, something was different. Her emotional expression had changed dramatically. I was frank with her, but it didn\u2019t change her mood very quickly.\u201dPhilomel recalled what she had heard from her before in the prison cell.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say things like her diet and words also changed?\u201dCatherine clapped her hands.\u201cThat\u2019s right! That\u2019s why it was strange. It\u2019s hard to change that kind of thing in an instant, even if it\u2019s a human mind. But Ellen had changed.\u201dShe pointed her fingers and listed the changes in her Ellencia.\u201cOriginally, she walked slowly, but she got really fast, and she ate very quickly.\u201dBecause of her empathy, Philomel involuntarily nodded her head. Ctherine\u2019s words were not over.\u201cBesides that, minor habits change, she obviously didn\u2019t remember what I told her before, and she asked for money saying she\u2019s going to the capital\u2026\u201dPhilomel opened her mouth.\u201cEven before, did Elencia like spicy food? Did you like it?\u201d\u201cAh! I remember hearing that. She once asked if I could make the food spicy, she hadn\u2019t even found it spicy before. But she liked it.\u201d she furrowed her brow. \u201cAnd she said something else. That my cooking is too greasy?\u201dLe Guin, who had been listening while leaning against the wall, shrugged his shoulders.After that, Philomel asked Catherine a few more questions about Ellencia. Catherine answered honestly, but nothing new was discovered. Ellencia suddenly changed one day. As of now, like everyone else, this was all Philodel could know.\u2018No progress has been made since then\u2026\u2019Catherine, who saw her face darkening, took out a book and offered it to Philomel.\u201cWould you like to read Ellen\u2019s diary?\u201d\u201cDo you have a diary?\u201d\u201cHuh. It was the day she bought a diary for her old birthday. She used it occasionally. It seemed like she wrote it even after changing. Come to think of it\u2026 She actually sat in front of her desk more often than before. She looked very bored.\u201dShe did not know that the diary would be a clue to unlocking Ellencia\u2019s secret. At least she could get a glimpse of her inner thoughts.\u201cWhere is the diary now?\u201d\u201cIf nothing else, it should be at the house, right? You took Ellen out of the blue, and she ran away with only her belongings. Could it be that Ellen brought her belongings here after that?\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201dAccording to the report, there was no such thing. Millie said that Ellencia came to the imperial palace and got her everything new.\u2018I\u2019m going to go to Ellensia\u2019s hometown right now and find her diary.\u2019As Philomel got up, she asked Catherine one last time.\u201cDo you know exactly where the diary is in the house?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know because Ellen hid it. I couldn\u2019t find it at home because I was worried after she changed suddenly.\u201dIf that\u2019s the case, she would have to go and find it herself.\u201cPhilomel\u2026\u201dPhilodel\u2019s steps towards the door were stopped by Catherine\u2019s plaintive voice.\u201cI\u2019ve said it before, but I\u2019m really sorry. I\u2019ve committed a sin I can\u2019t repay even if I prayed for you all my life. I won\u2019t dare to ask for forgiveness.\u201dPhilomel answered without looking back.\u201cThat\u2019s okay. Now, what are you doing talking about that? Think about how you will throw it away from here in the future.\u201dThis was a prison. A prison where she had to be alone for the rest of her life. Anyone trapped in this room with a maddening sense of loneliness was bound to lose their mind someday. Despite that, the person currently locked in this room spoke calmly.\u201cI\u2019m fine. Compared to the sins I\u2019ve committed, I\u2019m a light star. And it\u2019s okay that you came to visit me like this.\u201dHappy. She thought she would never see her face again. In response to those words, Philomel uttered a different sound.\u201cEven if Ellencia comes to visit, what happened today is a secret. Can you do that much for the daughter you abandoned?\u201d\u201cOf course! Besides, that child now is not the Ellen I knew.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll believe you. Then goodbye.\u201dPhilomel opened the door and went outside.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The door slammed shut with an ear-piercing, grinding sound. Catherine said in silence.\u201cIsn\u2019t Le Guin going?\u201dThen Le Guin, who had been leaning crookedly against the wall until then, turned to her.\u201cI have something to tell you.\u201d\u201cWhat is that?\u201dCatherine asked, trembling slightly. Seeing those golden eyes, more like a reptile than a human, her body shrank involuntarily. In fact, she was quite surprised to see a man who was very cooperative with Philomel. Although the time spent together for his experiments was short, Catherine was able to glimpse the man\u2019s true nature. He was laughing at the time he mercilessly let even the monsters run away. That person was not a being who could put feelings in his heart. But why did he act like a cat with missing claws to Philodel? Just because she was his daughter? Or was there any other special reason?\u201cI mean. I don\u2019t like it.\u201dHe came over to Catherine, who was sitting on her stool, and grabbed her chin.\u201cBecause you did useless things, I found out about Phil\u2019s existence belatedly.\u201d\u201cSorry.\u201d\u201cIf you had informed me as soon as you gave birth, as per the contract, none of this trouble would have happened.\u201dThe man\u2019s eyes narrowed.\u2018I may die on the spot.\u2018Catherine thought for a moment and closed her eyes. But contrary to her expectations, Le Guin obediently removed his hand.\u201cWell, okay. You\u2019re the one who gave birth to Phil\u2026 and I\u2019m just annoyed, but I don\u2019t want to get rid of you. From now on, quietly cooperate with that child\u2019s plan.\u201dCatherine rubbed her chin against her cold hand.\u201c\u2026Why do you help Philomel even though you say it\u2019s annoying?\u201dIt took a lot of courage to ask just that one question. Le Guin, who was preparing to leave, answered her.\u201cI like her quite a bit.\u201d\u201cWhy? Any special reason?\u201d\u201cHmm? Well,\u201d the man who didn\u2019t even bother asking why, scratched her head. \u201cIt\u2019s fun just watching. Emotions are varied\u2026 Of course, I don\u2019t want her to cry, but anyway, I want to keep watching for a while.\u201dThe man, who had an expression of understanding alone, disappeared with the brilliance. Catherine was somehow relieved. If she stayed with him, Philomel wouldn\u2019t be in danger, she thought.\u201cPhilomel.\u201dShe remembered the child she had given birth to. She recalled her memories of the first time she decided to have the child.\u201cI\u2019m looking for a woman to give birth to my child. Would you like to apply? The more applicants, the better.\u201dThe wizard who saved himself from a group of monsters said so. At the time, Catherine was in great self-loathing. She felt like trash with no value whatsoever. Catherine\u2019s family criticized her for kicking out the Empress\u2019s maid of honor. She might have died at the hands of her brother, William, had it been discovered that, in fact, she had incurred the Emperor\u2019s wrath and driven her away. At such a time, the one who appeared in front of Catherine was the owner of the mage tower. The greatest wizard in the world.\u2018If it is the child of a great wizard, it will become a great being as well, right?\u2019Catherine wanted to have the man\u2019s child. It seemed that if she gave birth to a great child, her value would rise as well. So she volunteered for the experiment. Rather than trying to become a person of value herself, she had a weak psychology, wanting to be satisfied through her children. Of course, even if this child became a great person, she did not become great. She only realized that after she got pregnant.Catherine\u2019s self-loathing intensified.\u201cWow, long time no see! Catherine, I missed you!\u201dWhen Isabella appeared, her self-loathing was mixed with an inferiority complex. Why couldn\u2019t she treat her friend as innocently as that child?\u201cA name for the child? I\u2019m thinking between the two, but I think it will probably be Ellencia.\u201dWhy was it that the woman he loved was Isabella and not herself? On the day in question, when she came to her senses, it was after she had switched her friend\u2019s child with her own child. She, too, was an irredeemable piece of trash. Rather than mourn the death of her friend, she was blinded by her desires. Would it have been a kind of surrogate satisfaction for her desire to be loved by him instead of her own child?\u2018The self-sufficiency\u2026 I also had something in mind as a child\u2019s name\u2026\u2019Catherine muttered in her low voice, recalling the face of the child who had been here a moment ago.\u201cBut she won\u2019t need it.\u201dPhilomel. A child who didn\u2019t need the name her cowardly mother thought of. A child who straightened her shoulders confidently even in the face of harsh trials.\u2018Ah, I\u2019m so glad you don\u2019t resemble me.\u2019* * *Philomel, who had returned to the residence first, asked Le Guin, who had returned late.\u201cDid you have a good talk with Catherine?\u201d\u201cYeah. It wasn\u2019t a big deal.\u201dIt was only after she left the tower that she noticed that no cat was following her. If it was Le Guin, he would know with his movement magic and he would come back well, but the fact that he remained in the tower was unexpected.\u2018Do you have anything to talk about with Catherine?\u2019She didn\u2019t know that maybe he also had inner affairs to solve. Even if they are not a couple, weren\u2019t they the parents of one person?\u2018But no matter how I looked at it, it didn\u2019t seem like a relationship beyond the experimenter and the subject\u2026\u2019When Philomel flirted with Le Guin, he asked in a rather cautious manner.\u201cPhil, are you disappointed that Catherine and I aren\u2019t dating?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dHe pointed in the direction of Philomel\u2019s study.\u201cLooking at the books you have, it seems that a woman and a man always meet and fall into the irrational feeling of \u2018love\u2019, and then marry each other and have children.\u201d\u201cWhat book did you read?\u201d\u201cThe title is so\u2026 \u2018Fateful love\u2019, \u2018The secret of the perfect Count\u2019, \u2018The secret between the Grand Duke and the maid\u2019\u2026\u201d\u201cAaaagh! Stop!\u201dPhilomel groaned and covered Le Guin\u2019s mouth.\u201cIf you said those embarrassing titles a second time,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll never see your face again in my life.\u201dSeeing that resolute gaze, Le Guin nodded his head several times. After freeing his mouth, Philomel covered her face with the palms of her hands.\u201cHow did you see that? I must have hidden it!\u201dAs expected, it must have been too complacent to hide such books in the corner of the bookshelf covered with objects. At least she should have ripped off the colorful cover and visited the camouflage\u2026 No. She should have just burned it after seeing it all. However, another thought popped up in Philomel\u2019s mind, which was stained with shame.\u2018Why am I ashamed? I just bought those books to research <Princess Ellencia>!\u2019It was. At first, it was definitely because of <Princess Ellencia>. She wondered if another <Princess Ellencia> was circulating on the market. There was no law anywhere that the only book Philomel had was <Princess Ellencia>. Fortunately, another princess, Ellencia, was not found after a long investigation. All romance novels in which the princess or the princess were the main characters were all cooks, but there was nothing similar to them. Later, she expanded the scope to novels in which a noble lady was the main character, but the novels such as <Princess Ellencia> were the only novels she had.Philomel was relieved only after having a maid search through out-of-print books. She thought that she wouldn\u2019t be in danger of being found out by others for being a fake princess, but the problem was that she became a terrible romance novel maniac in the process. It was embarrassing to show those books, which were also mixed with vulgar content, to others, but she couldn\u2019t bear to throw them away because her heart hurts.\u201cThat\u2019s why I hid them\u2026\u201dPhilomel\u2019s hands trembled. She was so embarrassed to be caught by someone else! And that, of course, to her father!Le Guin asked even more carefully.\u201cIs it a decoy?\u201dWhat? There was nothing wrong with him reading the book, but Philodel answered with clenched teeth.\u201cYes\u2026 You can see them\u2026 But don\u2019t go wrong with them. (No. You can. But don\u2019t do that next time.)\u201d [Note to Aoko: in the original this dialogue was like that, probably because the author wanted to explain Philomel words to us, I should delete it but\u2026 I kept it so you could see it]\u201cYes\u2026\u201dPhilomel asked after taking a deep breath to calm her mind.\u201cSo what were you talking about?\u201d\u201cAre you disappointed that I and Catherine are not lovers?\u201d\u201cRight. That was it.\u201dPhilomel readily shook her head.\u201cI\u2019m not disappointed. Yes, I was a bit disappointed when I first found out, but that\u2019s an old story.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cReally. Whether you two are in love or not, what\u2019s the matter? It\u2019s not like I\u2019m changing myself now.\u201dIt was a fact that Philomel had come to realize after returning to her palace and feeling a little happiness among many people. She told Le Guin that it was no big deal, but in fact she was devastated when she first learned the truth about her birth.A test subject born without parental love.She was envious of Ellencia. How beautifully the love between the Emperor and the Empress was portrayed in the book.\u2018Because she was born as the fruit of such a beautiful and sorrowful love, Ellencia must have been destined to be loved by everyone.\u2019Philomel thought so subtly. And she naturally thought she didn\u2019t deserve it. Because she\u2019s just a failed experiment. Born out of practical interests, not love. However, many people liked Philomel.Despite knowing that she was a fake princess, there was the Countess of Deles, Count Pollan, and her maid of honor, Melinda. The other ladies\u2026 and Nasar, Le Guin and her three brothers were more friendly to Philomel than expected. If it wasn\u2019t for her, would they have dared to follow her here?Thanks to them, she realized that Philomel was someone she could be happy enough with.\u2018I don\u2019t envy Elencia anymore\u2026\u2019Whether Le Guin and Catherine were lovers or experimenter and test subject, Philomel was still only Philomel.Philodel uttered the same words in a confident voice.\u201cI\u2019m not disappointed.\u201dLe Guin\u2019s face brightened a little.\u201cThen I\u2019m glad.\u201d\u201cBut why do you ask that?\u201d\u201cJust curious.\u201dPhilomel was puzzled, but she asked no more. She had her immediate work to do. It was time for her to get Ellencia\u2019s diary in her hands.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Philomel decided to go directly to Ellensia\u2019s hometown. She said to Le Guin that it was okay for her to go alone, but he said she was his job and he felt sorry for leaving her to someone else.\u2018I want to see the house where Ellencia and Catherine lived once again\u2026\u2019Jeremiah stayed at the State Guest House to meet them as they left.\u201cSheesh, it still hurts just to stay here.\u201dHe complained, but one had to stay. Philomel looked at him and said.\u201cSorry. If someone comes, deal with it appropriately and send it back. Dolls can\u2019t speak, so Jeremiah has to convey my thoughts instead.\u201dNext to Jeremiah stood a doll that looked just like Philomel. It was a doll made with magic by Le Guin. It was indistinguishable from a real human only by appearance, and even simple movements could be followed. The only downside was that it couldn\u2019t speak, so she really needed someone to assist me.Jeremiah grumbled.\u201cOkay. Go quickly. Le Guin doesn\u2019t have to come back.\u201d\u201cA spoiled child.\u201d\u201cWhy are you fighting again? Come on, let\u2019s go. Jeremiah, I\u2019ll buy you a sweet dessert!\u201d\u2018Whoaaaaaa!\u2019A bright light soon spread.When she opened her eyes, the two of them were in the mountains. Le Guin looked around the wooded area and frowned at her.\u201cWas it wrong? I can\u2019t see the seal.\u201dThis was a place he had never been to, so he had no choice but to use movement magic by relying on the coordinates marked on the map. However, there were often cases where the location on the map and the actual location of a rural village like Ellencia\u2019s hometown were different. Philomel unfolded the map of Utina that she had brought with her.\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have gone too far. Walk a little.\u201d\u201cShall I just hug you and fly? We will look for it in the sky.\u201d\u201cCan I go?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dIt was time for Philodel and Le Guin to have such a conversation. A muffled sound could be heard not far away. The two of them walked towards it quietly as if they had promised. Miscellaneous items were placed on the ground, and five or six young men surrounded them. Judging from the awkward atmosphere, it didn\u2019t seem like an ordinary gathering. The two hid themselves in the bushes and watched what they were doing.A man with a teddy bear in his hand said sullenly.\u201cAh, there\u2019s nothing worth the money.\u201dThe man who opened the lid of the pot answered.\u201cHoney, you\u2019re the only one with one ring left in the jewelry box. Give it to me if you don\u2019t like it.\u201d\u201cAnd what I meant was that there was nothing better than the house the princess lived in.\u201d\u2026The house where the princess lived?Another took the teddy bear man\u2019s words. He was examining cosmetic bottles.\u201cMan, this is all treasure.\u201dThe teddy bear man made a puzzled face.\u201cHow is this a treasure?\u201d\u201cYou idiot. Isn\u2019t Ellencia, the new princess, the most famous person in the empire these days?\u201d\u201cWhy is that?\u201d\u201cAdvertise it as something that the princess used when she was a commoner. It will sell like crazy.\u201d\u201cSelling that well? It\u2019s just junk.\u201d\u201cOriginally, if it\u2019s a celebrity thing, it\u2019s sold even if it\u2019s garbage.\u201dThe pot man didn\u2019t say a word.\u201cI still can\u2019t believe that Ellensia is the princess. It seems like only yesterday that she was walking around her neighborhood blushing.\u201dThe cosmetics man smiled sinisterly. Besides, Ellencia was really pretty. There were perverts who wanted to get more fancy when it came to things belonging to pretty girls.The teddy bear man cheered.\u201cWow, then this is all treasure! Let\u2019s go back to the house and get some more!\u201dThe pot man giggled.\u201cWhat\u2019s left? We went all the way to the trash and cleaned it up.\u201dAt that time, the man who had been silently rummaging through the pile of books so far shouted.\u201cOh! This is great!\u201d\u201cWhy, what is it?\u201dThe man held up the pink notebook.\u201cLooks like a diary!\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s?\u201d\u201cLook at this childish picture on the cover. Did Aunt Catherine wear this? Of course it\u2019s Ellencia\u2019s.\u201dThe faces of the other men suddenly brightened.\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cOf these, it must be the most collectible.\u201d\u201cHow much would I earn if I sold it?\u201d\u201cYou know that all the money you get from selling this is divided equally, right?\u201d\u201cAre you crazy! I found it!\u201dPhilomel thought as she looked at the group of men whose atmosphere had become bloody as if a fight would break out at any moment.\u2018It didn\u2019t take too much time, since I\u2019ve been able to find the diary\u2026\u2019A faint light spread from Le Guin\u2019s hand.\u201cShould I handle it?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re bad guys\u2026but don\u2019t kill them.\u201dLe Guin made his way through the grass in front of them.\u201cWho, who!\u201d shouted the men caught at the crime scene.\u201cAre you aiming for this too!\u201d\u201cWe steamed this one first!\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re not part of this, act as an outsider and get out of here!\u201dWhoaaaaa!The men who rushed at him fell to the ground in the blink of an eye.\u00a0 Le Guin flinched, exposing only the whites of his eyes, pulling the diary from the man\u2019s arms.He said after handing the diary to Philomel.\u201cBut one guy ran away. He ran away from the beginning without attacking me. Shall I bring him?\u201dPhilomel answered as she dusted off the diary.\u201cLeave him alone. I\u2019m not here specifically for vigilante activity.\u201dThe current priority was to check the inside of this diary. A pink diary with a cute teddy bear on the cover. Would Ellencia\u2019s secret be written in it?Philomel perched on a nearby rock and opened the diary, feeling her heartbeat.\u2018First of all, from the first page\u2026\u2019Ellencia\u2019s first note in the diary was written about three years ago.[Month X, 2th, weather clear. My mom bought me a cute diary. I will write a diary every day from now on!]The next note in the diary was the date a week after that.[Month X, 9th, clear weather. I forgot to write in my diary. From tomorrow, I will use it every day!]And after a month,[Month Y, 9th, the weather is cloudy. I just decided to write a diary when I feel like it. My mother made beef stew for dinner. It was delicious.][Month Z, 1st, the weather is fine. Today\u2019s breakfast menu was tasteless cabbage soup. Lunch was hard bread, and dinner was boiled potatoes.][Month W, 1st, weather rain. Downstairs Jacqueline\u2019s older sister went out to a big town and boasted that she ate a snack called cream puff. The cream puffs were delicious and smooth, she said. I want to eat it too.]All notes\u2026[Month T, 2th, the weather is fine. My mom cooked peas and carrots. I ate the peas and secretly threw away the carrots.][Month S, 4th, cloudy weather. Bread for breakfast, potatoes for lunch, roast pork for dinner.]Philomel opened her eyes mischievously.\u2018It\u2019s almost nothing but eating..Did Elencia eat that much?\u2018Although she liked spicy food, she didn\u2019t really have that impression in the diary\u2026\u2019Anyway, the important thing was not the front of the diary, but the part written at the time when the potato person changed.Philodel quickly turned the pages of the diary.\u201cUh?\u201dThen her hand stopped. The diary, which had been short from a certain point, suddenly felt longer. Strangely, that wasn\u2019t the only thing.An endless sequence of characters. On her white paper stood letters she did not know.\u2018I don\u2019t know. I have no idea.\u2019It didn\u2019t mean that she simply couldn\u2019t interpret the meaning. It was an unfamiliar text that she had never seen before. Philomel was confused. While she was being educated as her heir to the throne, she came across almost all kinds of texts. In most of the cases she was familiar with the letters themselves, even if she did not know the meaning. However, this letter was different. It was the first time she had ever seen it, and it bore no resemblance to any text she knew.A character written by only a few tribes? Or ancient letters?? However, if it was such a character, it was strange that Elencia used it.As Philomel looked at the diary with a serious expression, Le Guin approached.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cLe Guin, do you know this letter?\u201dSeeing the page she held out, he narrowed his forehead.\u201cI don\u2019t know. First time I see it.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it an ancient letter?\u201d\u201cWell. I\u2019ve been to many ancient ruins, but I\u2019ve never seen a letter like this.\u201d\u201cMaybe a code\u2026\u201d\u201cSomehow I don\u2019t think so.\u201dThe two of them put their heads together for a long time, but they couldn\u2019t come up with a hypothesis.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Talk to Lexion or Jeremiah.\u201d\u201cCardin isn\u2019t helpful.\u201d\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201dLe Guin pointed to the men who were still lying on the floor.\u201cWhat about these guys? Do we leave them alone?\u201dPhilomell looked around her. Men and housekeeping were intertwined and chaotic.\u201cI hope these people don\u2019t steal from Ellencia\u2019s house again, but is there any way?\u201dLe Guin laughed a sinister smile.\u201cTrust me. This is a good opportunity to try out the newly developed spirit world magic.\u201dPhilomel decided not to ask about the magic in detail. After dealing with the people, the next thing was the problem. Household items resembling the years of Catherine and Ellencia were scattered all over the place. For some reason, she just didn\u2019t feel comfortable leaving it here.When Philomel suggested putting things back in the house, Le Guin said, \u201cYou\u2019re so nice.\u201d said he, but he helped at the end. After walking through the forest, the two found a village. After a while, they entered the house of Ellencia and Catherine. Philodel picked up items that appeared to belong to Ellencia on the main floor and headed to the second floor. Le Guin took over the first floor.However, there were passengers in Ellencia\u2019s room.\u201cD-do, don\u2019t move! I thought you would say no to daring to touch us in this town!\u201dHe was one of the runaways among the group they defeated earlier. He held out a small knife with trembling hands.\u201cI knew you would come here. The purpose is Ellensia\u2019s stuff, right?\u201dHe seemed to know Philomel and Le Guin as thieves just like them.\u2018You\u2019re really bothering me. If you close your eyes, I\u2019ll run away.\u2019She said after putting the items she was carrying on the floor.\u201cYou\u2019d better quit. Holding something like that is dangerous.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous! The guy who used to do weird tricks anyway, whether it\u2019s magic or not, is the guy you were with!\u201d\u201cYou have nothing, so you are homeless?\u201d\u201cY-yes!\u201dThe man was taken aback by Philomel\u2019s calm demeanor. Looking closer, he had a younger face than she thought. He was a boy who had just become a young man rather than a man?Philomel gave a final warning.\u201cIt would be good for you to put down the knife.\u201d\u201cHa. Don\u2019t talk arrogantly about something you\u2019re afraid of getting hurt! Even if you shout, you\u2019ll die at my hands before that man comes!\u201dWhoops, she laughed.\u201cYou\u2019re probably the one who\u2019s scared. A coward who doesn\u2019t even have the confidence to attack an opponent stronger than himself.\u201d\u201cHey hey\u2026!\u201dIt was clear that he was holding the hilt, but the man rushed at her as if being pushed.Papa baba babat!At that moment, the air around Philomel shuddered and an intense spark flew.\u201cHeuk!\u201dThe man\u2019s body bounced off and crashed into a wall. His twitching body soon calmed down as if he had lost his mind. The automatic defense magic that Le Guin had previously cast was activated. The magic boasted the same power as the last time it was tested. This was why Philomel was able to put the knife-wielding man in front of her and not blink her eyes.Looking down at the man, she murmured.\u201cI told you it was dangerous. Not me, but you.\u201d* * *\u201cHmm, so this was aimed at your life?\u201dThere was life in Le Guin\u2019s eyes as he looked at the man. The man, who had barely come to his senses earlier, trembled and fell forward.\u201cI\u2019ll do anything! Please save my life!\u201dLe Guin asked Philomel.\u201cI will do anything. Is there anything you want to do?\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d\u201cThen without hesitation.\u201dLight poured from the tips of Le Guin\u2019s fingers.\u201cOh, wait. I have a question for you.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI want to ask him about Ellencia. That person is a resident who lived in the same neighborhood. He might know something.\u201dThen, Le Guin chinned the man.\u201cDid you hear that? If you can\u2019t give us any useful information\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I know! Do you need information about the little-known princess? I\u2019m around the same age, so I spent most of my time with the princess.\u201dIt sounded like a lie, but since she had come this far, she decided to listen.The man spoke quickly.\u201cThe princess\u2019s hobby is to climb mountains and observe wild animals. She likes to eat delicious food, especially high-end desserts that are not found in rural areas like this. And also\u2026\u201dPhilomel said to Le Guin.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Do whatever you want.\u201d\u201cAhh! There\u2019s another one! Again! I know the place the princess used to go often in secret!\u201dThis was a bit tempting.\u201cWhere was it?\u201d\u201cA little further down there is a pond, and next to it is a shooting star rock. I\u2019ve seen the princess sitting on the shooting star rock and deep in thought a few times!\u201d\u201cHow far do I have to go?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of five minutes.\u201dIf it\u2019s that far, she could get there in no time. Philopel moved her steps in the direction the man pointed.\u201cI\u2019ll go lightly for a walk.\u201dLe Guin grabbed the man by the collar and asked.\u201cAre you okay alone?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not a kid, so how about it? There\u2019s a magic that Le Guin gave me.\u201dNot only that, but Philomel was able to immediately notice when the automatic magic was activated.\u201cOkay, have a good day.\u201dHe had something he wanted to do while Philomel was gone, and he shook his hand willingly.After going a little in the direction the man pointed, a really small pond appeared in front of Philomel. It was a small pond with clear water. And next to it\u2026\u201cIt looks like a star, so it\u2019s a shooting star rock. I thought it was a real shooting star.\u201dCuriously, the rock took the shape of a five-pointed star.\u201cHahaha.\u201dPhilomel sat down on the rock, just like Ellencia did.\u201cDid you come here for no reason? There\u2019s nothing flattering about it except for the unusual shape of the rock.\u201dThe surface of the rock was smooth as if someone had deliberately carved it out. Feeling a bit tired, Philomel laid down on the star-shaped rock.\u2018Ellencia, what the hell did you think while sitting here?\u2019A cool wind blew from somewhere. Suddenly, her eyelids grew heavy. And that moment.Tiri-ring.She heard upbeat music that she had never heard before. Philomel\u2019s vision distorted as she raised her body in surprise. The whole world was dyed pink. But the change was short-lived.\u201cUh?\u201dHer vision returned to normal in an instant.\u201cWhat? What just happened\u2026?\u201dPhilomel stayed there for a while, but nothing like the one before happened.\u2018Is it because I\u2019m tired?\u2019Come to think of it, in the morning she had drained her strength from climbing the endless stairs of the eastern tower. After much thought, Philomel concluded that she had fallen asleep and must have been dreaming of herself.\u201cBut I\u2019ll remember it for now.\u201dAfter muttering, Philomel came down from the rock and headed towards Ellencia\u2019s house.* * *Several days have already passed since she went to Ellencia\u2019s hometown. In the meantime, Ellencia\u2019s unexpected birthday party was held, but Philomel ignored her invitation to it. There were plenty of other opportunities to closely observe Ellencia\u2019s actions.\u2018I don\u2019t have to go to a tired banquet.\u2019It was another matter that Philomel was all over her mind. Needless to say, she had Ellensia\u2019s diary. With her diary in front of her, her round forehead wrinkled.\u201cMmmmm.\u201dThere was no way that the meaning could be interpreted just by involuntarily looking into the text.\u201cHa\u2026\u201dShe put the journal aside and sighed. The identity of the enigmatic code still written in Ellencia\u2019s diary was shrouded in mystery. When Lexion saw this text, he shook his head, saying he didn\u2019t know. It was the same with Jeremiah, and Cardin hadn\u2019t seen the cat that always guarded the room recently.\u201cI\u2019ll search the library of the Mage Tower.\u201dLe Guin left this place the other day, leaving only these words. Lexion also said she would find out in every way. While they were working hard for themselves, Philomel couldn\u2019t stand still.\u201cIt\u2019s highly unlikely, but we have to try.\u201dShe said sadly and left her palace. Her destination was the Emperor\u2019s Palace. She was going to ask the Emperor to let her go into the Emperor\u2019s private library. The Emperor\u2019s dedicated library was a place where records passed down from the beginning of the Belerov Empire lay dormant. All kinds of state secrets that were only allowed to the Emperor were there, from the contents of the oracle that was said to have been received in the highest secrecy to the secrets of the empire\u2019s founding.\u2018Even if you think it\u2019s a good place, there\u2019s no way they\u2019ll let me in.\u2019But there was no other way. It was because she had already read all the records allowed to Philomel that could be related to the mysterious language. Philomel entered the Emperor\u2019s office with the feeling that she would try to bump into it even if she had to broke the door.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dThe Emperor replied coolly. It was the moment when Philomel\u2019s heroic determination was disappointing.\u201cCan I really go into Your Majesty\u2019s private library?\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cReally, really?\u201d\u201cReally, really.\u201dIt was so unreasonable that she asked without even realizing it.\u201cNo, can you just let anyone in like that?\u201d\u201cYou are not anyone.\u201dPhilomel was delighted but a little discouraged. Had she known it would be like this, she would have done it sooner. Anyway, being grateful was just right in that situation.\u201cThank you! I\u2019ll see only the necessary data and come out soon!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay to have as much as you want. I\u2019ll tell the manager in advance.\u201d\u201cAh, as an outsider, I can\u2019t pry into state secrets.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not much to say that it\u2019s a state secret\u2026 Come to think of it, there\u2019s one book you shouldn\u2019t touch.\u201d\u2018A book I shouldn\u2019t touch??\u2019Philomel tilted her head.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s a waste to just leave such a pretty ring in a jewelry box.\u201dIn fact, it was to get permission from the Emperor to be seen a little better and enter the dedicated library. It was the ring he had given her, and he was the one who found it and returned it when Roseanne took it away, so Eustis smiled happily.\u201cAnyway, you really like learning, too. You\u2019re curious about an ancient language and want to enter my library.\u201d\u201cHaha, I\u2019m a bit interested in languages\u2026\u201dShe hadn\u2019t even opened the book since she stopped taking classes for successors, but when he said that, it stung her a bit. As the conversation paused, the Emperor, who had been looking at Philomel, opened his mouth.\u201cPhilodel, if you have time in the afternoon\u2026\u201dKnock, knock!However, Count Pollan\u2019s voice from outside the door along with a knock interrupted the Emperor\u2019s words.\u201cYour Majesty! I am very sorry while we were talking. However, there is a call from the western border right now\u2026!\u201dIt seemed very urgent and important that Count Pollan cut off the Emperor\u2019s audience. She felt he had to step aside, so Philomel greeted him.\u201cI\u2019ll just go away.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dAfter Philomel left the office, \u201cYour Majesty, something big is going on right now\u2026 My, what\u2019s wrong with me\u2026?\u201dCount Pollan\u2019s desperate voice was heard for no reason, but he did not attract her attention.\u2018I\u2019ll go and find it soon!\u2019Philomel made her way to the basement of the Emperor\u2019s Palace, where the Emperor\u2019s exclusive library was located. Even though she didn\u2019t have a specific light source, she\u2019s been given a call and a hug. She looked around the place filled with the smell of old books. It wasn\u2019t narrow, but it wasn\u2019t unexpectedly wide either. She did, but the bookshelves were long enough to reach the ceiling and were full of materials. They came in a variety of forms: books, stacks of papers, scrolls, and even clay tablets. The manager standing outside the store said politely to Philomel, who stepped inside. Even he, the administrator, could not enter the library carelessly.\u201cIf you want to look at the books that are high up, you can use the ladder over there. You don\u2019t have to worry about organizing the books. All books have a magic that will return them to their original place after a certain period of time.\u201dWhen the door closed and the manager was gone, Philomel moved in earnest. As she was looking for a bookshelf where language-related materials were kept, a strange object caught her eye. Unlike other books, the book was floating in the air, not on a bookshelf, and glowing deer connected to the wall were wrapped around the book.\u201cIs that the book?\u201dAn object Eustis mentioned that should not be touched. It was one of the treasures of the imperial family, the \u2018Book of God\u2019. It was said to be a book that recorded the words of the God Belveron.\u201cI want to touch it, but it\u2019s over there. How can I touch it?\u201dMoreover, it was sealed with a chain made of divine power. Surely only the Emperor knew how to break that seal. Philodel took his eyes off the Book of God and even found what she was looking for.After a few hours.\u201cAhhh, I can\u2019t find any more!\u201dPhilomel knelt down on the table in the center of the library. Several old books are stacked like a mountain on the table. Records that appear to be related to ancient languages and rare foreign languages have been brought as they exist. However, when she read it roughly, there were no letters that looked similar to the letters written in the diary. So this time, she tried to take a closer look, but the progress was slow like a turtle. Looking at a word, looking into a dictionary, looking at a word, looking into a dictionary.Philomel murmured in vain.\u201cWhat if nothing else comes out here? Do I have to break into the secret library dedicated to the 4th High Priest?\u201dA book floating in the air came into Philodel\u2019s eyes as she recalled the face of the virtuous high priest. She didn\u2019t know if even a clue was written in the Book of God. Philomel stretched out her arm toward the book. She didn\u2019t want to read the Book of God seriously. It was just a feeling of grabbing at least a straw. But she had a presence that responded to her feelings.Dig!A light shone from the ring of red flames on her right hand. And the deer of light broke in an instant and scattered into powder.\u201cMy God, that\u2019s nonsense!\u201dFlustered, Philodel panicked. She herself only stretched out her hand. The ring didn\u2019t even rub!Either that or not, the Book of God slowly descended and came to Philomel. At that moment, it came to mind that the Emperor\u2019s private library is one of the most sacred places in the imperial palace. Even her dull-witted senses could feel the holy energy that filled the library. And the ring contained the Emperor\u2019s divine power\u2026 It seemed that the key to unsealing the book was the Emperor\u2019s holy power.\u2018What should I do?\u2019But even after thinking about it, she couldn\u2019t come up with a definite answer.\u201cAnd how do I get this back?\u201dWas this book also included in the \u2018all books\u2019 that the attendant said will return to its original state when time passes? It had to be. The Book of God was a book that was only permitted to the Emperor. Even the successor could never read this book before ascending the throne. If she was caught touching this book, this time she would be sentenced to death.Philomel brushed it off. It had already happened anyway. She\u2019s not a princess now, so she wouldn\u2019t have a chance to check the contents of the Book of God again.Having made up her mind, she picked up the book with trembling hands. And with her dictionary in her arms, she slowly read through her book.\u201c\u2026Can I read it?\u201dThe inside looked relatively plain. It was an old form of imperial language, but it was not unreadable. But being able to read it and understanding what it meant were two very different things.\u2018It\u2019s too philosophical\u2026\u2019For example, it was a series of vague sentences similar to \u2018the present is the present, and also the past and the future\u2019.\u201cAll things\u2026 the dreamer\u2019s animated dream, but the dreamer\u2026 and also as a part of that dream\u2026 If you don\u2019t dream\u2026 will you be able to control your dreams?\u201dWhat did it mean? Fortunately, it wasn\u2019t just vague words. Occasionally, prophecies that clearly warned of dangers in the distant future also stood out.\u201cBeware of intruders from other worlds. They do all sorts of tricks and steal the bodies of other beings, so only a true warrior can defeat them.\u201d\u2026Another world? The words Le Guin said about Ellencia\u2019s magic potion passed through her head. There was a high possibility that <Princess Ellencia> and the bottle containing the magic potion were made of something not from this world. If so, she guessed, they were from another world.Investigations continued after that, but that view did not seem to have changed to this day. Philomel took out the pen she had brought with her and copied the passages referring to \u2018other worlds\u2019. As a bonus, other impressive passages. Then, when her stomach growled, the hand holding the pen stopped. She skipped lunch and stayed here. If she stays too long, the manager will be amazed.\u2018Let\u2019s stop here for today.\u2019Eustis gave Philomel permission to come and go here for the next week. Fortunately, the used books were slowly recovering their place in the stand. Then the Book of God will find its place on its own. After leaving the book on the table, Philomel stood up and headed for the door. And she opened the door to get out of the library\u2026Footsteps were heard. Along with the voices of the Emperor and Count Pollan. They were discussing a certain topic with serious faces.\u201cOkay.\u201dIt could be a sign of the monster wave in 2019. Certainly, \u201cOh, but hasn\u2019t it been 5 years since the last monster wave ended? At least 10 more years are needed\u2026\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that why we\u2019re going to look at the relevant records? It\u2019s about two hundred years ago, but this has never been the case in the past\u2026\u201dPhilomel quickly closed the door and caught her breath.\u2018What to do, what to do?\u2019The sign of a monster wave that suddenly appeared was also unusual, but she had more important issues. The Book of God was still on the table. The moment the Emperor enters the library, she would be caught. As long as he had eyes, he would know that the book had disappeared in the air.Shall she run away with movement magic? But even if she did, the fact that she did it was not covered up. If so, what to do\u2026\u201cYes, even if you run away, let\u2019s run into each other.\u201dPhilodel went out the door with a fake smile. Before long, the Emperor found her.\u201cPhilomel, have you been in the library all this time?\u201d\u201cYes. I lost track of time and was so absorbed in the book.\u201d\u201cI see. You haven\u2019t had lunch yet, so hurry up and eat something.\u201d\u201cUmm, how about your majesty?\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cHave you had lunch?\u201d\u201cNo. The conversation with Pollan got longer, and there were other meetings in the middle.\u201dPhilomel blocked Eustis from approaching the library door.\u201cIs there anything you want to say?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s not an urgent business, wouldn\u2019t it be better to eat first? I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll damage your health.\u201d\u201cSkipping a meal will not harm my health.\u201dAs he grabbed the doorknob, Philomel hurriedly grabbed the Emperor\u2019s wrist.\u201cI want to eat with you. Right now.\u201dThen, a strangeness appeared in his black eyes.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s been a while. What do you recommend first?Come to think of it, since returning to the imperial palace, not once did she invite him to have a meal or tea time first. The dinner to see him was usually held by the Emperor, and sometimes by Ellencia\u2019s recommendation to Philodel. Did it seem too unnatural to do this now?\u201c\u2026Are you not willing?\u201d Philomel asked cautiously.\u201cNo. It\u2019s a good night. Prepare the food now.\u201dIn fact, the Emperor ordered the attendants standing behind Count Pollan to prepare their seats as quickly as possible.He tried to reassure Philomel, \u201cYou go first and eat. I\u2019ll do my own business and go.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Wouldn\u2019t it be better to take care of it quickly and eat slowly?\u201d\u201cI want to dine with Your Majesty as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re very considerate. I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d\u2018No, I\u2019m not\u2026!\u2019Philomel bit her lip. Now there really was only one way. After taking her deep breath, she exclaimed \u201cAh!\u201d and grabbed her stomach with both hands. Her body slowly disintegrated.\u201cPhil!\u201dFortunately for her, right before she crashed to the floor, Eustis\u2019 arm braced Philomel\u2019s back.\u201cWhy!\u201d\u201cMy stomach, my stomach hurts so much\u2026\u201dIt was a performance with all the strength of the body, but her tone was hard as if she was reading a book. Philodel basically had no talent for acting. The expressions of Count Pollan and the attendants naturally became grotesque as they watched her.She could imagine her own self from others perspective. She should look like a spoiled fool.\u201cMy, my stomach\u2026\u201dHowever, she couldn\u2019t bear to quit in the middle and continued her acting. Even when nobody trusted her acting.\u201cPhilomel! Stay awake!\u201dNo, one but the Emperor cried out with Philomel in his arms.\u201cWhat are you doing! Call the court physician quickly!\u201d\u201cYes, yes!\u201dMany of the attendants scattered at his order. However, the Emperor himself moved, as if he couldn\u2019t wait for the time to call the court physician . Even through her closed eyelids, a bright radiance could be felt.He used divine power to teleport with Philomel.\u201cWhat kind of disease is this!\u201d\u201cThat is\u2026\u201dThe young doctor pointed to Philomel\u2019s belly at the Emperor\u2019s question and only put on a puzzled expression. He was the one who had the misfortune of examining her because the head doctor was away.\u201cYou have a mouth, so why can\u2019t you speak? Could it be that she has a serious illness?\u201d\u201cThat, rather than that\u2026\u201dThe doctor was almost on the verge of crying. There was no problem in his own opinion, but the Emperor came out of the way and it seemed that he couldn\u2019t say it properly.Lying on the bed and looking at the situation with narrow eyes, Philomel apologized to the doctor in her heart.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry. Please hold on a little longer.\u201dShe didn\u2019t know exactly when the Book of God would find its place, but at least it didn\u2019t seem like it yet. It was then.Growl.Still hungry, Philodel\u2019s stomach cried loudly.\u201cDamn it, what kind of disease makes that sound in the stomach?\u201dPhilomel wanted to glue that mouth together.\u201cI\u2019m embarrassed!\u201dEventually, the Emperor even spat out words he shouldn\u2019t have said.\u201cIf you can\u2019t fix it, you\u2019ll die. The same goes for the others. In this palace, I\u2019ll dry the seeds of those who are called doctors.\u201dOh, she couldn\u2019t stay still.\u201cYour majesty\u2026\u201dPhilomel gave as much limp voice as she could.\u201cPhilomel! Does it hurts a lot?\u201dThe Emperor came closer to the bed.\u201c\u2026It hurts a little. And please don\u2019t talk like that. Even if they can\u2019t fix me, how is it the doctors\u2019 fault? If all of the curt physicians disappear, who will take care of the sick? They too are someone\u2019s parent, brother, or child. I\u2019ve always felt uncomfortable whenever His Majesty spoke of who would be killed or saved\u2026\u201dAs Philomel kept talking, he put on a shy expression.\u201c\u2026I get it. Be careful, I\u2019m glad though. You seem to have the strength to speak.\u201dAt that time, the door to the doctor room opened and the head court physician walked in.\u201cI\u2019m sorry! The attendant who came to pick me up and the road crossed paths\u2026\u201d\u201cWhere did you go and are you coming back only now?\u201dThe Emperor, desperate and holding back what he wanted to say, pointed to the bed.\u201cExamine Philomel.\u201dThe chief courtier looked at the Emperor with a puzzled face and approached Philomel.\u201cExcuse me for a minute.\u201dAfter examining Philomel\u2019s body, his face changed color. Then he looked down at her own patient with mischievous eyes.\u2018I heard you. It\u2019s just malingering\u2026\u2019Unlike the young doctor, with his experience, he should be able to tell the Emperor the truth as it was. During the last boating incident, he calmly informed the Emperor that Ellencia, who had fallen into the water, was faking her illness. However, instead of going to the Emperor, the head curt physician whispered in Philomel\u2019s ear.\u201cHow many weeks would you like to transpose?\u201dAfter thinking for a moment, Philomel replied in an equally low voice.\u201cAll it takes is one day.\u201dThe head court physician smiled and told the Emperor about Philomel\u2019s illness.\u201cIt\u2019s good. Get some rest.\u201dPhilomel grabbed the Emperor\u2019s sleeve as he was about to leave the doctor\u2019s office. It would be difficult if he had already returned to the library.\u201cCan\u2019t you stay here a little longer?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019d be better off without me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sick, so I\u2019d like someone to stay by my side. Most likely, His Majesty. Is that a presumptuous request?\u201d\u201cNo. I will stay.\u201dEustis, who was sitting next to the bed, nagged at her, telling her not to overdo it and to take care of herself, but soon fell silent. He kept his seat silently, and after a while, he got up when Philomel pretended to be asleep. Thus, with the help of the head doctor, Philomel\u2019s malingering went undetected. The Book of God also returned to its original place in time, and there was no commotion after that. Philomel had time to contemplate the contents of the Book of God while recuperating in the council room for a day. And for a while, items sent by the Emperor arrived at her palace. It was a variety of restorative ingredients including the fruit of the world tree.* * *In the dining hall of her palace, the Emperor and Philomel were having lunch together.\u201cI came to do something I couldn\u2019t do before.\u201dSaying that, Eustis stopped by her palace just thirty minutes ago.\u2018Something I couldn\u2019t do the other day\u2019 refers to lunch. A few days ago, Philomel had said something to prevent him from entering the emperor\u2019s library.\u201cI want you to eat with me. Right now.\u201dShortly thereafter, the Emperor himself went to eat the meal that was canceled because she fell while holding her stomach. When Philomel asked if he had invited her to the Emperor\u2019s palace, the Emperor said with a deliberately stern expression.\u201cYou\u2019re not feeling well, but what are you going to do if you fall down again?It seemed that the last feigning illness had given him the perception that Philomel was a weakling. She couldn\u2019t even actively deny it. The dining atmosphere was very quiet. The sound of plates and forks clashing was unusually loud. The two silently brought the food to their mouths.\u2018Because it\u2019s quiet, it\u2019s really awkward because it\u2019s so quiet\u2026\u2019In the meantime, whenever she ate with him, Ellencia was always there, so she felt the silence she hadn\u2019t felt in a long time. As a child, Philomel also chattered in front of the Emperor, but as she grew older she became more reserved. Suddenly, an old memory came to mind.It was when she was nine or ten. One day while having dinner with the Emperor, he had an urgent matter to deal with. Little Philomel was left alone in front of the wide dining table. She was sad, and even though she had been told by the Emperor to eat alone, she stubbornly waited without touching the food. Because the main dish on the table that day was made from the carp she raised.At the time, she had a carp that had been kept in the Pond of Philomel\u2018s palace. Even if it was raised, all the young princess did was throw food at the fish she caught, but the title of \u2018Philomel\u2019s carp\u2019 was important. It was an expression of how much she liked and respected the Emperor, even serving carp she had raised herself.\u2018Now that I think about it, it was really childish.\u2019But at best, how could the idea that comes out of a child\u2019s head not be childish and exhausting? At the time, all of Philomel\u2019s attempts to win the Emperor\u2019s favor were similarly childish. It was a child who smiled happily at the thought of feeding the Emperor a plump, fat carp.As young Philomel watched the carp grow cold before her eyes, her heart broke.\u201cI won\u2019t eat until your Majesty comes!\u201dShe was obstinate and embarrassing her attendants. It was a time when she was conscious that she had to become dignified with her head, but her actions did not always follow. Fortunately for her, they didn\u2019t play the bell because they couldn\u2019t get her princess\u2019s meal. She was so hungry that Philomel snatched her fork and knife.\u201cHmmmm, but it\u2019s not filial piety to hurt one\u2019s body while starving. I can\u2019t cause concern to His Majesty the Emperor.\u201dEven after the meal that she noticed was over, Philomel continued to remain at the table in regret. Now that he had come, she intended to wait for the Emperor and see his face at least once. But her stomach was empty. She was drowsy while waiting. Clinging her chin, the small Philomel blinked narrowly. It wasn\u2019t until quite some time had passed that she was awakened by the sound of dishes clashing.When she opened his eyes, Eustis was sitting and eating. He was removing the flesh of a carp that had cooled down.\u201cWake up. Why didn\u2019t you go back after finishing your meal and instead slept here like this?\u201cPhilomel felt a little worried. She wondered what to do if he thought he had been fed a dish that didn\u2019t taste good.\u201cYour Majesty, it\u2019s all cold, so don\u2019t eat it. I\u2019ll told the servants to bring new food\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s worth eating.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201dDespite her objection, the Emperor continued to eat the carp until there was no more than one bit left.\u2018Something like that happened\u2026\u2019It was only for a moment, but looking back he did act like a father. Philomel corrected her mind to listen to her strange sentiments.\u2018Come to your senses. It\u2019s a thing of the past.\u2019She opened her mouth, which had been kept firmly shut.\u201cYour Majesty.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say there was something you wanted to tell me in the past? That, a confession\u2026\u201dOn the day she received the transfer of a huge fortune from him, there was something she hadn\u2019t heard since Ellensia appeared. She thought that that confession might be one of the reasons why the Emperor kept paying attention to her. If he had something he wanted to say but couldn\u2019t do, she wanted to give him the chance to say it. However, Eustis remained silent with a serious expression on his face.Philomel became uneasy with his sobriety. Is the confession such a heavy topic for him to make such an expression? Philomel thought about it very hard, but she had no idea what it was about.Come to think of it. Confession? What was he going to say to her to the extent of using such a grandiose word?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The cat came through the open door, jumped up, and sat on Philomel\u2019s lap.\u2018Why is this person like this again?\u2019Because of that, the Emperor\u2019s confession was cut off.\u201c\u2026Now, we\u2019re eating, so go down.\u201dShe picked his chubby body from her lap and put him down, but the cat jumped up again.\u201cGo down.\u201dShe put it down once more. But she came up again. The cat, sitting on Philomel\u2019s lap as if it were in place, waggled his tail.\u2018Why would you do this?\u2019Having never been on her lap before. Philomel narrowed her eyes and looked down at the cat.\u201cAre you raising a cat?\u201dAt the Emperor\u2019s question, Philodel\u2019s gaze shifted from the cat to him. Come to think of it, this was the first time the Emperor had seen Le Guin.\u201cI am.\u201d\u201cSince when?\u201d\u201cSince around the time I just returned to the imperial palace.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know you liked animals. No actually, when you were little, you raised a koi in the pond of your palace.\u201d\u201c\u2026 you remember?\u201dShe didn\u2019t expect that Eustis would still remember it.\u201cYeah. Didn\u2019t you prepare a meal for me with that carp?\u201d\u201cThe cooking was done by the chef, and I only served carp\u2026\u201d\u201cIt looked good then. You said you would grow vegetables in the garden next time and make me a salad.\u201d\u2026really? Even Philomel herself did not remember that. Come to think of it, when she asked to break off her marriage with Nassar, Eustis recalled a memory Philomel couldn\u2019t remember. But she was a person with a strangely good memory though.\u2018So I made you a salad? I don\u2019t remember that\u2026\u2019Starting with the carp that Eustis mentioned, the conversation about bygone days continued like flowing water.\u201cYou don\u2019t know how surprised I was when His Majesty suddenly hugged me during the Foundation Day.\u201d\u201cIs that so? I didn\u2019t know that, I just acted without thinking.\u201d\u201cEveryone present was equally shocked.\u201dIt almost happened at a time when Philomel was actively seeking to be recognized as his successor. She was quite surprised even as she said it. Hadn\u2019t she lived her life hiding herself wearing a mask? When she was young, she was happy whenever her plan was successful and she was recognized step by step by the Emperor. She also had a sense of accomplishment. But at night when she was alone, the fear of her future visited her as a child. Her daytime joy was washed away.Quantitatively speaking, there were more painful memories than pleasant ones. And the painful memories always came to her mind before the pleasant ones. The negative side of anything was stronger than the positive side. But how could he smile and say it like it\u2019s nothing at all? It was as if that fragmentary memory was true happiness.\u201cAww!\u201dThe friendly conversation was interrupted by a sudden sharp sound. The cat stood on the table with its front paws.\u201cWhy are you like this? Seriously\u2026!\u201dPhilomel whispered into his pricked ear, but the cat only looked straight ahead of her. The eyes of the Emperor and the cat collided only in the air with the person sitting opposite. Human and animal glared at each other.\u201cWhy are you all like this?\u201dIn an unusual atmosphere, Philomel hurriedly lifted the cat and sent it out the door. The cat struggled to get back inside, but when she squinted her eyes, the silver cat stopped moving. When she returned to her seat, Philomel looked at the rest of the people.\u2018Let\u2019s say Le Guin is like that. Originally, he didn\u2019t seem to like the Emperor very much.\u2019Even so, the personalities of the two were very different. Eustis was strict with himself as much as he was strict with others. As Philomel remembered, he was always at work. If it had not been for his painstaking efforts, the prince born under the careless Empress would not have been able to ascend the throne. Originally, he was on the side of concentrating his energy on reign, but after his wife died, he clung to work worthy of being evaluated as \u2018married to the state\u2019. In a word, he was a quiet hard worker. On the other hand, Le Guin threw away the mage tower and he didn\u2019t have enough sense of responsibility to the extent that she was left alone here. Sometimes, when he had to go to the Mage Tower, he showed signs of being reluctantly dragged away by Lexion\u2019s wiping. In his own words, after suddenly awakening his powers as a child, he became the most powerful wizard without much effort. To put it in one word, he is a lazy genius. Whether he was a cat or a human, he spent most of the day rolling around, there were times when he would nag and say things without realizing it. At such times, Le Guin would pout at her.\u201cDo you want me to be a boring human being like that Emperor?\u201dPhilomel didn\u2019t even mention the Emperor\u2019s name. It was an incomprehensible sensitivity. She thought he just really hated the emperor.\u2018Well, Le Guin is like that, but why did Eustis stare at the cat so much over there? No way\u2026 Did he discover Le Guin\u2019s true identity?\u2019If so, it was very difficult. The Empire and the Mage Tower basically had a cooperative relationship, but invisible conflicts existed. Philomel thought of the Emperor who seemed to be in a bad mood whenever there was an issue related to the mage tower. There was a great concern that the magic tower master hiding his identity and secretly living in the imperial palace would turn into a big problem. In that case, she imagined the uproar that would happen, and her head started to hurt.She tried her luck to get Eustis\u2019 intentions.\u201cYour Majesty, I apologize. My cat did a disservice. Please punish me it as its owner.\u201dThe Emperor replied with a face that seemed lost in thought.\u201cNo. But that cat\u2026\u201dDid he get the real essence? It was Le Guin\u2019s transformation technique that had never been discovered by anyone, but it seemed that the Emperor might recognize it with some special intuition.\u201cWhat about my cat\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a bit rude saying that in front of you\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine, so don\u2019t be difficult and tell me without hesitation.\u201d\u201cSince you say so, I will tell you. That cat earlier\u2026\u201dWhat was he so lazy about? Philomel\u2019s lips dried up as she waited for his answer. He opened his mouth slowly.\u201cIt was so ugly.\u201d\u201cIt looks bad?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re willing to keep another animal, then you\u2019d better pick one that doesn\u2019t look so uncomfortable.\u201dWas that all? Philomel brushed her drowsy chest. It really made people\u2019s hearts tremble. By the way, the Emperor\u2019s aesthetic sense also had an unusual corner. She was not saying this because of her own biological father, but Le Guin as a cat was objectively and subjectively very cute. Considering Empress Isabella\u2019s beauty, his taste for human beauty seemed normal\u2026 Was it only for cats that was different?Philomel just tilted her head.* * *At the same time, at the Imperial Palace, the\u00a0 Court Magician Lexion was dealing with his father who barged into his laboratory. Le Guin, who sat across his son\u2019s studies, dampened his irritation.\u201cAh! I\u2019m pissed off!\u201dLexion looked at the documents he was looking at and replied indifferently.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cThe unlucky Emperor. Why is he pretending to be friendly with someone else\u2019s daughter?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve said it before, but he is the one who raised Phil for ten years\u2026\u201d\u201cHe found his real daughter. Can\u2019t he be satisfied with one daughter?\u201d\u201cBy that logic, someone with three sons should yield.\u201d\u201cWhy am I? No matter how much I argue, don\u2019t I look more suitable as the father of the girl than he does?\u201d\u201cYes. I can see it.\u201d\u201cWhich side?\u201d\u201cEmotionally, it\u2019s hard to deeply sympathize with that child, and since you\u2019re older, Phil might feel the three generations difference\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you know? Pearl once told me that my mental age was young.\u201d\u201c\u2026That is not a compliment. How are you so arrogant?\u201dDespite his advice, Le Guin did not care about what he said, choosing to listen to his own interests.\u201cTo be jealous that I and Phil got along better.\u201d\u201c\u2026Your relationship definitely seems to have progressed more than before.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. But he keeps interfering\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not Le Guin, but that kid and Guin Guin that get along better.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s different. You honestly feel it. The way Phil\u2019s eyes look when she\u2019s facing Le Guin\u2019s real self and when she\u2019s facing the cat\u2019s are different.\u201dShe didn\u2019t seem to know herself, but Philomel gave the human Le Guin a rather cold look, while for the cat Guin Guin she was strangely warm. He also seemed to have felt it himself, but Le Guin couldn\u2019t resist and he glared at Lexion.\u201cYou\u2019re the one who proposed to gain favor with cat form in the first place.\u201d\u201cI meant it only at the beginning, but it didn\u2019t mean to be a cat for 10 years like now.\u201d\u201c\u2026She likes the cat figure more, so what should I do?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be sad. But do you know? If you keep working hard as a cat, I wonder if Philomel\u2019s father will be able to become a pet.\u201d\u201cI want to be a father!\u201d\u201cYou have to work harder. It seems to me that the other side is slightly more dominant.\u201d\u201cWhose side are you on?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m on Phil\u2019s side.\u201dThe mage lord clicked his tongue.\u201cMy son doesn\u2019t help at all.\u201d\u201cThen go and complain to the other sons besides me.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re a bunch.\u201dIf it was Jeremiah, he would ignore it altogether, and if it was Cardin, he would talk more, so he wasn\u2019t a good conversation partner.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Before you go, fix my doll and go.\u201dLexion pointed to his own figure in the corner of the lab. It was something that his father had asked him to do to get away from the surveillance placed on him by the imperial family. If there was a need to avoid the eyes of surveillance, his doll was put up as a substitute. It\u2019s a flaw that he could only do repetitive tasks, but it was much more helpful than nothing.A magic circle formed on Le Guin\u2019s hand, which was placed on the doll\u2019s forehead.\u201cIt\u2019s broken after using it for a long time. I can\u2019t do this for a long time.\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped. To take Phil to the Mage Tower.\u201d\u201cThe spell is very complicated. Can\u2019t we just go to the Magic Tower together?\u201d\u201cHonestly, we\u2019re glad Phil is still here.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly what she\u2019s trying to do, but she needs our help to do it. If it wasn\u2019t for that, Phil would have left long ago, saying she was looking for her own life.\u201d\u201cIs it?\u201d\u201cSo let\u2019s make sure to win Phil\u2018s favor while she still needs us.\u201dHmmm, Le Guin thought for a while and put on an expression as if he had decided on something.\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll try in a different direction from now on.\u201dLeaving those words behind, the Archmage disappeared in the blinding light. Left alone, Lexion murmured.\u201cPlease don\u2019t get into an accident\u2026\u201dAt that moment, his communications stone flashed and vibrated. It was a communication from the Magic Tower.\u201cYes, this is Lexion.\u201dAs soon as communication was established, a shout hit his eardrums.\u201cLexion! When the hell is the Lord of the Mage Tower returning? We\u2019ve got so many things to do that need to get his approval!\u201dAs another secretary of Le Guin, he was the one who handled most of the affairs of the current mage tower master.\u201cI\u2019ll tell him to visit the Magic Tower soon.\u201dA loud sigh came through the communications table.\u201cThat important thing, there\u2019s no sign of the end yet?\u201d\u201cYes. Le Guin is working hard too, but it\u2019s not easy.\u201d\u201cIf a person of the level of the Mage Tower lord is having a hard time\u2026 Eliminating the highest level monsters? Investigating hidden ancient ruins?\u2018Score points for his daughter.\u2018Lexion swallowed his words to protect the prestige of the Tower master. After the communication ended, he shook his head.\u201cWho would imagine?\u201dThe fact that the notorious mage lord was acting cute in the form of a cat these days. Even if he was the owner of the Magic Tower, it was difficult to win his daughter\u2019s heart.* * *In Philomel\u2019s residence. She was writing down what she had learned so far on a piece of paper.First, the person \u2018Ellencia\u2019 changed at some point.Second, the middle name that reflects Ellencia\u2019s soul was also different from the one in <Princess Ellencia>.Third, Elencia uses a magic potion of unknown origin.\u00a0Fourth, Elencia\u2019s diary was written in unknown characters from the moment she changed.Fifth, it was highly likely that <Princess Ellencia> and Ellencia\u2019s magic potion bottle were from another world.Sixth, intruders from other worlds written in the Book of Gods steal other people\u2019s bodies using evil tricks.It was like this once she gathered together the clues that seemed important. To put it all together, Ellencia was possessed by a different soul, but that was an intruder from another world, and the intruder\u2019s trick was a magic potion\u2026? If so, the letters written in the diary were from another world, and <Princess Ellencia> must also be a book from there.Philomel was troubled as she bit the soft flesh in her mouth. Was she too imaginative? It was a different world, but for some reason it was a hypothesis that didn\u2019t seem absurd. In addition to the six sentences written in large letters, there were several small scribbles on the paper.Philomel calmly went through them as well.The author of <Princess Ellencia> seemed to like spicy food like Elencia.When Philomel first came up with this speculation, she wondered if the author of the book was from the southern region, where spiciness was popular. However, if <Princess Ellencia> was an object of another world, the author must also be a being of that world. Judging from Ellencia\u2019s liking for spicy food, it seemed that spicy food was universally preferred in that world.\u2018Or that both of you lived in a specific area where spicy was preferred.\u2019Philodel took small notes and moved on to the next sentence.Elencia pinned down the not-yet-famous Margaret and entrusted her with her own dress. Her debutante dress, made by Margaret, was quite similar to the one described in her book. In the past, these phenomena were considered fate.Even if Philodel moved the timing forward by a year, what was supposed to happen eventually happened, but it wasn\u2019t exactly the same\u2026On the pretext of getting her dress tailored, Margaret, who was found by Philomel, told her.\u201cWell, isn\u2019t the dress I vaguely envisioned and the dress the princess wanted are strikingly similar? I really thought it was in and out of my head!\u201dAfter complimenting Ellencia on her debutante dress, Margaret brushed off her affair with Ellencia. It was more like a direction created by Ellencia than fate. It was as if she knew in advance what she would have to do a year from now and fitted reality into it. With that thought, the doubts she had felt so far were resolved.\u2018An unnatural first meeting with Nassar\u2026\u2019Why did Ellencia, who should be in the western palace, come to the southern palace and climb a tree? Because Nassar was there.Ellencia\u2019s maid at that time was Emily. According to her personal information later, when Nassar entered the palace, it was Emily\u2019s duty to find out where he was and inform Ellencia. She could also guess why Ellencia was trying to save the cat that was lying peacefully on the tree.\u201cThe cat was just an excuse for her to climb a tree to create a situation similar to what would happen a year later.\u201dThen, does Elencia see the future?\u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201dShe showed several loopholes in knowing the future. If she knew the future, she couldn\u2019t have drowned while trying to get on the boat, and she wouldn\u2019t have let Roseanne ruin her first tea party.\u2018Yes, rather than the future\u2026 I think she knows the contents of <Princess Ellencia>.\u2019Philomel calmly continued her thoughts. Considering the fact that the book was also from another world, that was a more reasonable reasoning. That there was another <Princess Ellencia> in that world, or that Ellencia had read <Princess Ellencia> before.Philomel took the book returned from Le Guin out of a drawer and picked it up. According to him, as of now, all possible investigations have been completed. How did the intruder who entered Ellencia, or Ellencia\u2019s body, read <Princess Ellencia> in that world?\u2018Why is the future of this world written in a book of another world? Why is it written in the language of this place even though it is a book from another world?\u2019It was still full of unknowns. Even thinking about it, she couldn\u2019t come up with a plausible hypothesis. More than anything, she couldn\u2019t get a sense of what that \u2018other world\u2019 was like. The divine world or the demon world in the legend?\u201cOr is it another world?\u201dPhilomel thoughtfully tapped the desk with her fingertips. The content of the \u2018other world\u2019 written in the Book of God was too ambiguous.\u2018I wish someone could give me an explanation.\u2019However, all the people who left records in the book were people of the distant past. No one was worth asking about the Book of God.\u201cWhew, that\u2019s difficult.\u201dIt was then that Philomel let out a big sigh.\u201cPhil!\u201dLe Guin burst into Philomel\u2019s room. He was somehow more motivated than usual.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dPhilomel asked as she got up from her seat.\u201cLet\u2019s go on a trip!\u201d\u201c\u2026yes? Suddenly?\u201d\u201cYou haven\u2019t been able to travel because you\u2019ve been living in such a stuffy place, right?\u201d\u201cThere were very few outings that could be called travel, to be sincere.\u201dThe only heir to the throne could not travel with peace of mind. There were also safety reasons, and\u2026 she couldn\u2019t even afford it. At least, the time she visited with Nassar was close to the first trip.Nassar\u2026Philomel\u2019s heart was heavy at the sight of his face that reappeared. It was said that Nassar was currently confined to the Duke of Avrydon. Refraining from all outside activities, including Ellencia\u2019s birthday party.\u201cYou said you feel like a friend, so I want to be your friend Miss Philomel.\u201dThe last time she saw him, he said that with a bright face, but there was no way it wasn\u2019t difficult. As Philomel\u2019s expression darkened, Le Guin asked cautiously.\u201cDon\u2019t you want to go on a trip?\u201dShe picked her words.\u201cEven if you ask me out of the blue\u2026\u201dIf he asked where she wanted to go\u2026 Philomel had listed all things she wanted to do later. Still\u2026\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m not in the mood right now\u2026\u201dPhilomel firmly shook her head.\u201cWhy?\u201dLe Guin asked with a somewhat heartbroken expression.\u201cMy head is complicated with other things.\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201dPhilomel gave him a summary of the story of the Book of God and the other world. It must have been absurd, but he listened to Philomel\u2019s words without showing anything like that. After he heard it all, Le Guin said.\u201cThen I\u2019ll have to go on a trip with you even more!\u201d\u201c\u2026why is that?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to meet someone who might know about that old book.\u201d\u201cWhen is that ever recorded, is such a person still alive?\u201d\u201cThe person must be dead.\u201dAfter emphasizing the word \u2018person\u2019, Le Guin smirked.\u201cIf it\u2019s a non-human being, it could still be alive.\u201d\u201cA non-human being\u2026?\u201d\u201cThe oldest of all living beings in this world, older than dragons.\u201dPhilomel realized what he meant. It was someone she knew.\u201c\u2026?\u201dLe Guin confidently held out his hand.\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s go see the World Tree for now.\u201dHaving said that, she took his hand.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNovel InfoNovel Info",
