It sounded as if the entire world was shaking.A large mountain was crushed into pieces and countless broken rocks flew into the air creating clouds of dust obscuring everything.Suddenly, with a shout, a figure broke out from the dust clouds. This figure, emmiting a dazzling light like thunder and lightning in a stormy night, was quickly flying forward. His tremendous speed led to a long streak of dust trailing him with the shape of a Chinese dragon crawling forward.Immediately after that, a crowd of figures flew through the clouds creating countless long streaks of dust, hurriedly chasing after the person in front, as if possessed!\u201cThe three largest factions had ganged together, and totalled 3496 cultivators, chasing me through thirty-seven thousand miles! Aha\u2026 you guys are really taking great efforts to eliminate me!\u201dWith a tremendous noise, Ye Xiao \u2013 the man flying in front, suddenly stopped on a flying rock, before quickly turning around with a wild laugh. The sharp light from a sword flew out of his hand at full speed, like a flashing streak of lightning of the firmament.It was the last of the power he contained!The light flew into the crowd like a lightning strike, causing pitiful cries to burst out. But, as one fell, another rose. Some of them bled in the skies before falling to the ground, all the while swinging their hands and feet!Ye Xiao was now bleeding profusely because of his previous strike which had rendered him unable to fly.\u5750\u5982\u5c71\u5cb3\u5cbf\u7136\uff0c\u7ad9\u4f3c\u901a\u5929\u957f\u8679\uff1b\u52a8\u6709\u98ce\u4e91\u6d8c\u52a8\uff0c\u884c\u5219\u9739\u96f3\u968f\u8eab\uff01(Sitting like a lofty mountain, standing like a great rainbow; acting like a storm surging, moving like a thunderbolt.)Sitting, standing, acting, moving, the four lines are excellent descriptions about the cultivators who have reached the Grade of Daoyuan [1].Although Ye Xiao had been the best of all the Daoyuan cultivators, after this last amazing sword strike, he was just a spent bullet. At the moment, he was like a lamp out of oil \u2013 he had no more energy left for flying. When he landed, the rocks under his feet had quickly become stained with his blood!Panting heavily, Ye Xiao still had the scorn in his eyes, and he sneered, \u201cHumph, I may have reached the end with no chance to get out and I may not be able to survive this, but even if I will die here today, I can assure you that most of you guys will die with me today!\u201dThe rock he was standing on, was on the peak of a huge mountain.When Ye Xiao looked back, he was like a king in the sky looking down with imperceptible stateliness even in this imminent predicament!Fearing his aggression, hundreds of the cultivators stood still in front of Ye Xiao! They were looking at him with misgivings in their eyes. Far behind them, beyond the limits of one\u2019s eyesight, there was a path. It was the path they had travelled which was currently made of countless dead bodies. An unexpected howling wind was coming over. A few decapitated heads with open eyes were blown and were sent rolling.The cost they paid for Ye Xiao\u2019s death was obviously shown by this path of death built of flesh and blood covering thousands of miles over mountains and rivers!Although this Xiao Monarch was clearly at the end of his rope and they knew that he would find it impossible to get away, for the moment, they still didn\u2019t dare to take a step forward!They all knew clearly that whoever dared to get closer at this moment, would instantly get killed and be buried with the dead and go to hell with Ye Xiao!No matter who, there would be no exception!It was a clear point with no room for any doubt.Because the guy standing in front of them, was the Xiao Monarch!Laughing out loud at all the heroes under the firmament, he was the monarch of the universe!The Xiao Monarch was a legend in the realms in the firmament!The 3496 cultivators from the three factions had set up huge traps and used countless approaches trying to hunt down Ye Xiao, travelled thirty-seven thousand miles and destroyed nearly every mountain and river they had passed. However, Ye Xiao on his own, had unexpectedly killed almost all the 3496 cultivators behind him, leaving countless broken lands and piles of dead cultivator\u2019s bodies wherever he went!Who could dare to look down upon such a formidable man?Even when he had reached his end, nobody would dare to challenge his sword!\u201cXiao Monarch! We wouldn\u2019t have ganged together to hunt you down like this if it were not for your perverseness against us.\u201d A sage-like old man in the crowd sighed, completely exhausted, \u201cI just don\u2019t understand why\u2026 our well known Xiao Monarch would suddenly declare war against us and try to kill us. What you did has led to losses on both sides. Since it won\u2019t do you any good, why are you doing this?\u201dAlthough the three factions finally had the chance to slaughter their shared enemy, Ye Xiao, the cost they had paid for it was totally unbearable. They had lost almost ninety percent of their warriors in this battle. The losses they had suffered were so massive, that they would find it impossible to revitalize themselves within the next one thousand years.The three factions would lose their top factions status in the Qing-Yun[2] realm once there were other factions rising \u2013 it must be the worst situation for them. Besides, there were still the Palace and the Temple aiming for their heads like tigers stalking their prey!After everything, they were still muddle-headed. They still couldn\u2019t understand what the problem was with this horrible Xiao Monarch?! This was truly to harm others without benefiting himself!Had the domineering Xiao Monarch, who persisted his old ways and had never cared about anything, gone crazy?Ye Xiao sneered, \u201cSo you don\u2019t get it? You really don\u2019t get it? Aha\u2026\u201dHe looked down at the huge pit on his chest through which his entrails could be seen and actually stretched his wounded body. He chillingly said, \u201cNo matter what dirty business you three factions did, I didn\u2019t give a damn about it. Except you forcibly occupied all the resources for cultivating, changed the energy sources and monopolized all valuable practice materials! You kept other people from cultivating themselves so that only you three factions could practice in the Qing-Yun Realm\u2026 You acted so overbearingly, even going as far as breaking people\u2019s futures. I just detested this! Since I detested it, I must discipline it!\u201d\u201cNo, Xiao Monarch! You are wrong! Only the virtuous should own the treasures in this world. Those who want to cultivate themselves should follow the law of the jungle. We did nothing wrong!\u201d\u201cWhat -hah!\u201d Ye Xiao laughed out coughing, \u201cThe virtuous you were saying? That is right. The treasures in the world belong to anyone. No matter who, the one who seizes them has the right to own them. On that I agree. However, you slaughtered millions of innocent people just because you wanted to control the miraculous mountains, using those souls of the dead as sacrificial offerings to build the power vein! You made large wealthy towns turn into wastelands filled with death and cold. Then you would cover your crime up with a claim that those places were suffering with pestilences and you had to do that to save the rest of the realm\u2026 How many times did you mindlessly murder a whole town and distort facts in these years? How dare you claim to be virtuous? Such bloody virtuous! HAHAHAHA!!\u201dHe laughed wildly with an undisguised tone that was full of taunt.\u201cAll cultivation resources are yours. Anyone who dares to take some will get no mercy and all his relatives will be killed \u2013 no one lives! You guys acted excessively first, I am just fighting back the same way. How difficult could it be to understand?\u201dHe bended his mouth and smiled sarcastically.After Ye Xiao spoke, the three leaders of the crowd \u2013 the heads of the three factions, had ungainly expressions.\u201cSo that\u2019s it\u2026 The reason you fought against us is simply to fight for justice\u2026 to defend cultivators against our injustice? Aha, what a noble man, Xiao Monarch! Even so, after your death today, who on earth would stand up and face us? We three factions may have suffered a great loss, but we are not destroyed. After no more than a thousand years, we will fully recover! What a pity. After today, there will no longer be a famous Xiao Monarch!\u201d The sage-like old man sneered.\u201cAs long as I am still alive, I will never let you proceed with it! If I die\u2026 the world would have nothing to do with me.\u201d Ye Xiao smiled indifferently, \u201cAs long as I can still breathe, the only thing I would like to do, is to wipe you bastards all out!\u201dEven though he was talking with disdain, he felt sorry in his heart that he could not wipe out the three factions as a revenge for his brother!It was his life\u2019s greatest regret!\u201cI see. We get it.\u201d The old man nodded slowly with a crazy murderous look, \u201cEnough talking, we will end your life! We won\u2019t let you stay alive!\u201dHe waved his hand; grinding his teeth, \u201cGo! Kill him! Whatever the cost!\u201dAll the warriors attacked at the same time with their full power! Hundreds of the warriors risked their lives by using all of their power in this final attack. Countless lights and noises mixed together with countless strong powers, striking Ye Xiao like a huge storm!The power created by the three factions together had really shook the earth and the sky. All that could be seen was dust flying up in the air as the land underneath seemed to crack. The mountains on which Ye Xiao had stood on top of previously were instantly crushed into pieces and dust now covered everything. With countless broken rocks flying up, the mountains in between them were completely destroyed all at once.Ye Xiao laughed out loud. After this one-month long battle, he was truly too exhausted. Even moving a single step felt like climbing the highest of mountains. He could do nothing to defend himself against all these destructive attacks, so he looked carelessly at his enemies with a smile on his face.Instantly, he and the mountain below his feet were about to be hit by this immense tidal wave of attacks!His voice boomed through the air right before he was hit.\u201cIt is to be regretted that I was fighting alone and failed to kill all of you! If I am given a second chance, I promise, I will cut down all your heads\u2026 Fighting alone and letting you bastards get away with your lives is my lifelong regret!\u201dAt the last moment of his life, the unbeatable loner Xiao Monarch finally realized his greatest weakness!He was solitary!Even though he had already become one of the supreme masters in this world, when facing the force of the three largest factions, he himself was simply not enough!BOOOM! An extreme explosion turned the entire sky-high solid mountain into a dust cloaked rain of pebbles and rocks.Dust overflowed and rocks rolled.The Xiao Monarch left his last words with his last breath,\u201c\u65e0\u6094\u6b64\u751f\u8def\u8270\u9669\uff0c\u552f\u6068\u65e0\u529b\u65a9\u51f6\u987d\uff1b\u82e5\u5f97\u6765\u751f\u91cd\u501a\u5251\uff0c\u5c60\u5c3d\u5978\u90aa\u7b11\u82cd\u5929\uff01\u201d(I don\u2019t regret my life even though it was so tough, but I hate that I couldn\u2019t wipe the evil out. If only I had an afterlife, with my sword in my hand, I would remove all the evil so that I could laugh out loud in the world.)In the mist, the sage-like old man looked at the mess, while murmuring with a sullen face, \u201cEven if you had realized\u2026 You wouldn\u2019t even stand a chance\u2026 and now, you will never know of the truth\u2026\u201dHe sneered, \u201cIf only I had an afterlife with my sword in my hand, I would remove all the evil so that I could laugh out loud in the world\u2026 Humph, what a pity, Xiao Monarch, there is no such thing as an afterlife!\u201d\u201cOff we go!\u201d The old man waved his hand. All the warriors turned back and left.No one had noticed that the moment when Ye Xiao died, a thin purple light had flashed briefly in the sky.As the wild wind was howling, all the dust was blown away. There were only the broken rocks on the ground. The mountain had already disappeared.Only in the air, there was the faintly discernible voice.\u201cIf only I had an afterlife with my sword in my hand, I would remove all the evil so that I could laugh out loud in the world\u2026\u201d\u2026\u2026Ye Xiao suddenly woke up!His entire body was screaming in agony. But while he was focusing on the pain; his mind fell into the endless confusion!\u201cWhat is going on? Wasn\u2019t I fighting against the three factions? Didn\u2019t I die? My body was destroyed and my spirit extinguished. My soul was gone. How could I still survive after facing that destructive attack\u2026\u201d He opened his eyes and a luxurious room entered his vision, and he felt like he was lying on a soft bed\u2026\u201cI didn\u2019t die?\u201dHe had suffered such immensely powerful attacks while having absolutely no power to fight back or even resist. He was surely smashed to pieces. How could he not be dead?Ye Xiao couldn\u2019t help but scratch his head, \u201cOh right, my body\u2026 Wait a second!\u201dHis eyes almost fell out of their sockets as he stared in shock at his stretched out arms.Hands with white skin, long bony fingers, even lovelier than those beautiful hands a girl possesses\u2026\u201cWTF\u2026These are not my hands!\u201d Ye Xiao was in a daze, while staring at his hands.The next moment, he quickly sat up and grabbed the mirror beside the bed and lifted it up to his face, then cried out.In the mirror he saw an unknown youth who was about 16 years old, with white skin and sharp eyebrows. It was a handsome guy with red lips that looked as pretty as a lady\u2019s .\u201cBeautiful\u2026\u201dHe stopped with a click of his tongue. Realizing it was not the right word to describe a guy and decided to correct himself.\u201cVery handsome\u2026\u201d He nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s better\u2026 But what the hell\u2019s going on?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThen he felt an excruciating pain in his head. A memory was flowing forcefully into his mind like a tidal wave, making him almost lose his consciousness yet again.Ye Xiao was grasping his head and he was gasping for air until he had finally absorbed the whole memory.\u201cOh, I see\u2026\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014[1] Grade of Daoyuan: There are nine Grades in the level system of Realms of the Firmament.From low to high- Grade of Renyuan, Grade of Diyuan, Grade of Tianyuan, Grade of Lingyuan, Grade of Mengyuan, Grade of Daoyuan, Grade of Xianyuan, Grade of Shenyuan, Grade of Shengyuan.There are nine levels in each Grade, which makes it 81 levels in total.[2] Qing-Yun Realm: One of the realms that lie in the sky above the mortal world, where Ye Xiao lived in his prior life.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even though he had been calm all along, he could never have imagined that this seeming impossible miracle had actually occurred.This body\u2026 had actually belonged to someone else\u2026Where Ye Xiao stayed at the moment was the Land of Han-Yang [1], the mortal world as it was known in the Qing-Yun Realm.Although this body had belonged to a stranger, he still retained the name Ye Xiao, as he and the former owner of the body coincidentally shared names. The previous Ye Xiao was the son of the Northern General Ye Nan-Tian in the Kingdom of Chen [2].It was in the General\u2019s House where our main character Ye Xiao awoke in his second life.He had been drinking all night at a brothel with his disreputable friends before he got home and died with an excruciating pain in the belly.At that moment, a tiny piece of our Xiao Monarch\u2019s soul was still active and coincedently flew into the dying body.\u201cI think I can understand my situation right now\u2026 No\u2026 I still don\u2019t get it\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao frowned, kneading his temple, \u201cI did feel my soul fading away\u2026 There was no way I can still be alive. How did I survive and got reborn in this body? Unbelievable\u2026\u201dHe didn\u2019t know what was going on, even though he was a quite knowledgeable man.It was absolutely impossible for this kind of thing to happen\u2026 but, it had really just happened to him.\u201cWell, fair enough\u2026 One who is alive has hopes and now I have mine. With my extensive experience, as long as I cultivate myself correctly, I will soon become the great Xiao Monarch again! When that day comes, I will take my revenge on the three factions and kill them all! NO MERCY!!\u201dHe gnashed his teeth, with a combative look.The three factions had spared no efforts to deal with him and they had finally beaten him to death, but they could never have thought that the annihilated Xiao Monarch was still alive at this moment.\u201cBastards, one of these coming days, I will surprise you all!\u201d He thought.While he was collecting his thoughts, he was suddenly assaulted by a pain inside his belly causing him to grimace. It was an unbearable pain that felt like his intestines were being torn apart.\u201cDamn! Now I know how this kid died\u2026 He was poisoned\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao realized what had happened to him immediately, since he had had lots of similar experiences. Even though he had realized what was happening, he couldn\u2019t stop the influence of the poison on the body. He was in too much pain to even wipe the sweat off his forehead.The boy, the son of a general, had actually been poisoned to death.At the moment, even though Ye Xiao had taken over the body, the poison still existed and had the function of causing death. However, while the poison was strong enough to have killed the boy, luckily it was not strong enough to kill Ye Xiao!\u201cIt is just nothing but a Qing-Ming Fruit Poison [3]\u2026 humph.\u201dYe Xiao thought, looking down at the poison, because he had identified the poison at once. Suddenly, his vision went black. He realized that the poison had started working again, so he decided to quickly use his spiritual power in order to clear up the poison, but was astounded to feel nothing in his body. That\u2019s when he realized that he wasn\u2019t the Xiao Monarch of his former life anymore. Now, he was just a playboy of a general\u2019s family, who seemed to have practiced some spiritual martial arts but had no spiritual power at all.Thinking of this, Ye Xiao nearly yelled out painfully while performing a face-palm.It would be a bad joke if the Xiao Monarch, who had just survived a huge disaster, would get killed by a trivial Qing-Ming Fruit Poison!The pain was turning more and more severe and Ye Xiao gnashed his teeth. He knew that he should try to survive first before considering anything else. He had no choice for now but to use the very last piece of his soul power to deal with the pain.Then, he sat still with his legs crossed and grimaced due to the pain, then transferred the soul power out of his mind. He quickly targeted the soul power to where the poison was present and then pressed it right on the poison\u2026\u201cPuff!\u201d Sputter.He spat out blood, while his face turned as white as a dead body.\u201cDamn\u2026 my last soul power\u2026 was actually used to deal with some lame poison. Now I really am faint\u2026 Who would have thought that there would be a day when I actually would be so embarrassed\u2026\u201d He wiped away the blood on his mouth and thought, \u201cFor now I have to remove the poison first\u2026 otherwise this body could rot in a few days\u2026 not to mention my revenge\u2026\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 even if I survive this stupid poison\u2026 I have no powers remaining to go with my cultivation\u2026 My experience\u2026 my classy formulas\u2026 are all wasted.\u201dHe murmured dolefully, \u201cRight now, I am like a wealthy man walking in the brothel. I have the money and there are girls, but I turned out to be a eunuch\u2026 A gloomy thing like this has happened to me. How can I be the Xiao Monarch? Why don\u2019t I claim the title of Xiao Moron\u2026\u201dComplaining wouldn\u2019t help. He realized that he should figure out a cure.\u2026\u2026\u201cWho\u2019s the steward? Come quickly!\u201d He yelled, \u201cGo buy me some herbs.\u201d He handed over a script on which he had just written a list of herbs to the steward. For the educated Xiao Monarch, spiritual power wouldn\u2019t be needed to cure the poisoning. He surely had some other way.Looking at the obsequious steward, he felt satisfied, \u201cAha, well at least it feels good to be a toff, giving orders and waiting to be served.\u201d\u201cUhh\u2026well\u2026 sir\u2026I am afraid\u2026\u201d The steward held the script, looked at it, then twitched his mouth and scratched his head, with a dazed look.\u201cUm? What?\u201d\u201cThese herbs\u2026 I am afraid that I have never heard of them\u2026\u201d The steward spoke humbly, \u201cMy lord, I have learned many of the herbs in the world. I also have read the Ben Cao Collection[4]. Yet these herbs\u2026 Ice-fruit, Fire-leaf, Phoenix bloom\u2026 I never heard of them. Where did you learn these from, if you don\u2019t mind me asking?\u201d\u201cUr\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao slapped his own forehead.Ye Xiao had almost forgotten that these herbs only existed in the Qing-Yun Realm. There should be none in this mortal world.\u201cNo no no, I was kidding buddy\u2026\u201d Sighed Ye Xiao, \u201cOff you go.\u201dThe steward scratched his head and left feeling confused. He wondered what his young master was going crazy for. He thought, \u201cHe actually sent me for some herbs? The guy thought he could pretend to be educated with some strange names written? Really, I don\u2019t have any word to say.\u201dYe Xiao then walked towards the General\u2019s study room in a rush.He got in the room, walked to the bookshelves, and began his search for some medical books, so as to find a cure for the poison.\u201cI knew it.\u201d Sighed Ye Xiao.The Qing-Ming Fruit Poison wasn\u2019t a classy poison for someone like Ye Xiao, but it was still something from the Qing-Yun Realm. There could never be any cure for it in the mortal world.\u201cIt seems that whoever poisoned me didn\u2019t spare any effort.\u201d Ye Xiao thought, \u201cHowever, if it stays like this, then I am in serious trouble. There is no cure here and I am unable to reach the Qing-Yun Realm. Do I really have no choice but to wait for death?\u201d\u201cOh right, if the poison exists only in the Qing-Yun Realm\u2026 Then, how can it be here? Maybe the poisoner has a few connections with people\u2026up there?\u201d Ye Xiao thought, and a cold light shone in his eyes.\u201cMy lord! Lord Lan has come for a visit!\u201d A guard standing outside the door reported.Not until this moment did Ye Xiao realize that the General\u2019s House was a really weird place.There were no females present, not even housemaids. All the people working and living here were guys.There were a few of them who looked spirited, but they were actually disabled.It was said that these disabled men were all ex-soldiers who had fought for General Ye.What a virtuous General, cherishing his soldiers!That was the first thing that Ye Xiao noticed about his current father!\u201cLan? Oh I see!\u201d Ye Xiao was blank for a while before a new memory came into his mind. Lan\u2019s full name was Lan Lang-Lang. He was the son of the Southern General. Now Ye Xiao and Lan Lang-Lang\u2019s fathers were the two backbones of this kingdom, one ruling the north and the other ruling the south.Ye Xiao and Lan were both sons of generals. Their fathers were often out away from home for years at a stretch, so they at some level shared similar feelings. That is why they hung out with each other and had eventually become bros. However, while the former Ye Xiao was a free nut, Lan was unable to act too unseemly because of his mother.There is even a full origin of Lan\u2019s name.The Southern General was a stammerer. The day before Lan was born, he was going home in a carriage, when he fell asleep.He had a dream while he was sleeping. A dream about sailing in the rough seas on a ship.When he got home the next day, Lan was born and the family wanted his father to name the baby.He was telling others about the dream at that moment. But, he was so thrilled when he heard of his son being born that he stammered, \u201cLa.. Lang\u2026 Lang\u2026 Lang Lang\u2026\u201d[5]Then the steward turned around and yelled, \u201cThe General has decided\u2026 My young master has been named Lan Lang-Lang\u2026\u201dAnd that\u2019s how it is. Lan Lang-Lang got his name, and became famous for it.The difference between Lang and Lang-Lang was like south and north, heaven and hell!\u201cXiao-Xiao, I heard that you were intoxicated last night.\u201d The girly voice of Lan came in before he stepped into the room, \u201cHah! Only a wise man like me would have gotten away early and thank god that I did\u2026otherwise I would have been led to become a bad guy by you playboys\u2026\u201dYe Xiao got angry and cursed, \u201cLan Lang-Lang you prick! Stop calling me Xiao-Xiao or I\u2019ll beat you to death!\u201dLan shrugged his shoulders and stepped into the room grinning cheekily, \u201cWere you not extraordinary last night? You actually got yourself senselessly drunk in a brothel\u2026 I have to say I admire that bro, I do!\u201d\u201cHumph!\u201d Ye Xiao rolled his eyes, \u201cHow do you know? You put a spy in my house?\u201d\u201cHah hah\u2026\u201d Lan started laughing, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t bother to do that in your shitty place.\u201dAfter exchanging a few words, Ye Xiao observed his current best friend. Although Lan was born in a wealthy family, he was skinny, so skinny that his clothes seemed to be oversized, which was not actually true. The slim robe on him clattered when he walked. There couldn\u2019t possibly be more than 100 grams of flesh on his body. He had weirdly curved eyebrows, a flat nose, big lips and funny naturally crossed-eyes.He had worn a big thick hat on such a sweltering day.Ye Xiao learned from the new memory that there was a reason for him to always wear a hat. His head had been affected with favus [6] earlier in the year. He had lost most of his hair and had become bald. He could not help but wear a hat\u2026Ye Xiao sighed, thinking, \u201cOh no\u2026 I was reborn in a weirdo\u2019s body, and now I have to be friends with another weirdo!\u201d\u201cOh my bloody god\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014[1] Land of Han-Yang: A realm known as the mortal world where Ye Xiao\u2019s second life starts, which is far below the Qing-Yun Realm.

Last night before I left, I put some drugs into Zuo Wu-Ji\u2019s drink. I have to check on him in any case.\u201d Lan Lang-Lang laughed loudly with a grimace, \u201cThat bastard has always been opposing us. He\u2019s too rebarbative really. After he lost the jade ruyi [1] of his father, he had been put under house arrest for like centuries. He has been released recently and I will never let this chance slip by\u2026\u201d\u201cI am not going\u2026 Wait. There is the possibility\u2026\u201d As Ye Xiao was worried about the poison being difficult to eradicate, how could he be interested in hanging out with this guy. Then he cheered up. In his memory, this Zuo Wu-Ji was one of of his disreputable friends that was drinking with him the night before, so he could be the guy who had poisoned him.This Zuo Wu-Ji, as far as he could remember, was also a weirdo. Although he was called \u2018one of the three lords\u2018 in town alongside Ye Xiao and Lan Lang-Lang, he always opposed the other two, fighting against them every time they met. It was hard for them to make peace.\u2018The three lords in town\u2019, was of course a derogatory term.There was a even a doggerel created describing them:The three lords in town, how wonderful; they were short in businesses, but good at squandering their family fortunes; they had gold, and silver too, but gave it out for mirth; they had no faces, but they were foppish. The Northern General, he had a son named Xiao; a dog mothered by tigers, was such a punk. In the Southern General\u2019s House, was like a rough sea; the man who named Lang, was a black sheep; The minister Zuo was talented, with a son named Wu-Ji, who had mortgaged the jade ruyi; what he used the mortgage for was food, drinks, toys and gals; he was such a lord, the top of the three!There was something about a jade ruyi mentioned in the doggerel. Several days ago, Zuo Wu-Ji had squandered so wantonly that he ran out of money. And in desperation, he actually mortgaged a jade ruyi of his father\u2019s collection when a bunch of his friends egged him on. The jade ruyi might not be very rare, but was a treasure nonetheless worth at least 500 kilograms of gold. Zuo Wu-Ji squandered it for a measly 50 kilograms of silver. Later, he was nearly beaten to death by his father, and became the No.1 black sheep in the Kingdom of Chen.This great Lord Zuo stood out within the three lords, which included Ye Xiao and Lan Lang-Lang, and became the champion black sheep in the group. He could really despise all others and turn up his nose at them.He exchanged something worth 500 kilograms of gold for just 50 kilograms of silver, and spent it completely in just three days\u2026 The way he squandered and dissipated the family money was really second to none.\u201cCome on!\u201d Lan Lang-Lang was so excited that his crossed eyes spread. He pulled Ye Xiao outside the house feverishly.The two dandies got on the carriage. Ye Xiao had not yet gotten used to this luxurious life, while Lan Lang-Lang was glancing left and right enjoying the scenery through the raised curtain with his crossed eyes. He rubbed his lips and whistled loudly. The loud whistle scared the women and girls on the street causing them to flee.While the carriage was proceeding, Ye Xiao suddenly felt something. This feeling made his heart beat with a bounce.It was an exclusive ability which he had used a lot of times, but had never understood how he came to posses it. This ability was used to detect treasures and items of value and when such items were nearby he would feel his heartbeat rise.He didn\u2019t expect to posses this ability even after rebirth. This should be a massive advantage in this new life.However, Ye Xiao felt confused. This was the mortal world. What was this treasure that could actually make the great Xiao Monarch use his ability?As the they moved further, the feeling got stronger.When they stopped, he felt that the treasure was right beside him, within his reach.When he got off the carriage and looked up, he saw three words Zuo Xiang Fu [2] written in gold on the gate of the House of the Minister.The feeling was actually coming from inside this house!\u2026\u2026\u201cLan Lang-Lang! You bastard!\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji shouted abusively, \u201cDid you drug me last night? Fxxk you! You nearly got me killed!\u201dZuo Wu-Ji started with the abuse as soon as he saw them.Obviously, the grudge this guy held against Ye Xiao and Lan Lang-Lang had been deeply engraved into his bones, unable to be erased.They fooled around with each other all the time and no one had admitted defeat yet. Although, he too had set traps for Ye Xiao and Lan Lang-Lang, it was merely playful\u2026 he couldn\u2019t believe that they actually drugged him \u2026Besides, the three lords used to be neck and neck, but now he had claimed the title for the biggest loser, much to the delight of the other two. Zuo Wu-Ji now couldn\u2019t help but grind his teeth every time he saw them.However, Ye Xiao didn\u2019t pay any attention to Zuo Wu-Ji. All his energy was used for observation. He focused at a table in the living room of the house again and again.On the table, there was only a white jade bottomed case, and on top of this case there sat a white stone. The surface of the stone was rough, making it look ordinary. It was totally bland except for a pair of fully spread wings engraved on it.It seemed that this was just one of the ordinary ornaments in the House of the Minister and it was never regarded as a treasure.While Lan Lang-Lang and Zuo Wu-Ji were busy quarreling, Ye Xiao was observing it with all his heart.As he observed it, he could not stop himself become delighted!\u201cYES! It is! I couldn\u2019t be wrong! That\u2019s the Pure Heavenly Crystal [3]!! It\u2019s actually the treasure!\u201dHe couldn\u2019t believe that he had found such an incredible treasure so soon after reincarnating.The Pure Heavenly Crystal is something which exists in the legends with no doubt. It takes 10 thousand years to shape up and then another 1000 years to grow 1 inch. It is something which only exists in the tales of old. People of the Qing-Yun Realm may only dream of encountering this crystal, let alone the people of the mortal world!In the Qing-Yun Realm, a tiny piece of this stone had caused a massive war between the factions. They fought crazily and caused countless deaths.Ye Xiao was puzzled about such a large piece of this crystal appearing in a mortal world such as this. And somebody had actually carved spread wings into it?!\u201cThis\u2026 this is such a fxxking waste of resources, it\u2019s infuriating\u201d, He thought.If anyone from the Qing-Yun Realm saw this situation, they would certainly pass out with heartburn. And if said person had a short temper, it would be a very easy decision for him to kill every resident in the city and burn everything down.Take our Xiao Monarch for example, he was frozen solid after witnessing such a colossal waste.It was like a pie that suddenly fell from the sky into the hands of a starving man.He needed to consider his actions which would enable him to take a bite. He didn\u2019t need to be greedy, just one bite will do\u2026There must be something over the surface of the The Pure Heavenly Crystal, covering its true exterior.And, according to where it was placed\u2026 they truly seemed to treat it as something trivial\u2026\u201cOnly if they can give it to me\u2026 no, not necessarily give the whole piece to me\u2026 just only one bite, even if I just scrape a bit powder for myself, it will be enough to cure me and be the bedrock of my super power, at once!\u201d Ye Xiao murmured, while being completely thrilled.What a treasure!It was good to be the son of a privileged government official.But what should he do to get this thing?Such a challenge!Sensing the high security in the House of the Minister, Ye Xiao was agitated\u2026 His body was as weak as a drugster, so either stealing or robbing\u2026 was not a possible option for him.\u201cYe Xiao!\u201d Lan Lang-Lang and Zuo Wu-Ji were yelling at him, \u201cWhat are you smirking for, you fool? What beauties are you imagining?\u201dNo wonder they were astonished.They had quarreled fiercely for quite a while. They even had spit a bit when they quarreled and had become really thirsty. And when they turned around, they found Ye Xiao was smirking, daydreaming and even drooling\u2026\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d Lan Lang-Lang and Zuo Wu-Ji both felt weird, \u201cWhy is he suddenly smiling with a goatish look\u2026\u201d\u201cWake up dude!\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji waved his hand in front of Ye Xiao\u2019s eyes.\u201cWHAT?\u201d Ye Xiao settled back, annoyed.\u201cCome on my dear Lord Ye, this is my house\u2026\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji, looking at the \u2018fool\u2019, eccentrically said, \u201cWhat the hell are you planning? Do me a favor all right? Don\u2019t make the satyr-like look again. We don\u2019t have any women here!\u201d\u201cWell, there are still guys. I think Lord Ye might be interested\u2026\u201d Lan Lang-Lang laughed wretchedly, eyes rolling around. What he said just now had drawn the fury of Zuo Wu-Ji.Ye Xiao also scolded him while rolling his eyes. Suddenly, he came up with an idea.\u201cOh hey, Zuo Wu-Ji, I heard that you had sold the jade ruyi recently. Is it true?\u201d Ye Xiao asked, blinking.\u201cShit\u2026\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji rushed forward and covered his mouth tightly, with a panic stricken face, spoke with a low voice, \u201cDamn you! Fxxk you dude! How dare you talk about this thing\u2026 How could I know it was worth that much? I was really out of money that day and I just took whatever was nearby to get some. Then I was enjoying it with a bunch of people for days\u2026 I didn\u2019t know it was my dad\u2019s treasure and was for some medical use until I got home a few days later\u2026 Come on man I have been through a rough time for it\u2026 The whole family treated me like a sandbag\u2026 Don\u2019t even mention it man, please. It will get me killed\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 hmm\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao\u2019s mouth was covered. He struggled quite hard to free himself. He planned something in his mind and said, \u201cIt was said that there will be an auction in Ling-Bao Hall the day after tomorrow, and\u2026 there will be a jade ruyi in the auctions\u2026 hah, it even looks just like your father\u2019s, no, it\u2019s of even better quality\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYes! Yes! There will be one.\u201d Lan Lang-Lang nodded unceasingly, \u201cIn the auction the day after tomorrow. I will be there, to enrich my experience.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014[1] ruyi: a curved decorative object that serves as a ceremonial sceptre in Chinese Buddhism or a talisman symbolizing power and good fortune in Chinese folklore.[2] Zuo Xiang Fu: The Chinese pronunciation of \u5de6\u76f8\u5e9c, which means the House of the Minister \u2013 the house of the Minister Zuo.[3] The Pure Heavenly Crystal: An extremely valuable stone, only with which our character Ye Xiao could have chance to get his super power back and become a cultivator once againPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Such a little thing could actually be worth 500 kilograms of gold\u2026 How pathetic that I was incited by you pricks to steal and sell it for only 50 kilogram of silver. Such a huge loss\u2026\u201dAnd while grinding his teeth again, he said, \u201cYou pricks have made me the No.1 black sheep in the world\u2026 I should never have mentioned it and swallowed it with my teeth and blood [1]\u2026 Now there is another jade ruyi present, but what can I do to get it?\u201dYe Xiao lowered the voice and said, \u201cHeh heh heh\u2026 It is just about money, isn\u2019t it\u2026 That\u2019s not a problem. I just want to ask you, do you want that jade ruyi?\u201d\u201cOf course! What a stupid question. Why wouldn\u2019t I want it! When I get it, I will finally get rid of the title \u2018the No.1 black sheep in the Kingdom of Chen\u2019\u2026 Only God knows how desperately I want to do so\u2026\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji nodded, grinding his teeth, \u201cBut I ran out of money when that shit happened. My allowance has been reduced from 15 kilograms of silver per month, to just a quarter kilogram\u2026 What the hell can I do with a quarter kilogram of silver?!\u201d\u201cYou want to get rid of the No.1 black sheep title\u2026 It is actually quite easy, only\u2026 You are about to be the unprecedented No.1 black sheep in the universe\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao thought.\u201cHah Hah!\u201d He laughed loud and struck his chest, speaking nobly, \u201cIf you really want it, I could lend you some money\u2026\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji was surprised, so was Lan Lang-Lang.Did the sun rise from the west?! Since when did Ye Xiao become so generous?\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d Ye Xiao nodded with a serious look.\u201cWhat on earth are you planning?\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji looked at him suspiciously, and did some calculations in his mind, \u201cThis prick, he really wouldn\u2019t be planning some business with me, would he? Could there be the possibility that he really is in love with me?\u201d\u201cYou bastard!\u201d Ye Xiao shouted with dignity and honor. Acting as if his kindness was wasted, he said with bitter hatred, \u201cZuo Wu-Ji! What the hell did you just say? I want to help you because I treat you like my brother. I am also taking a big risk doing so. Who knows when a bastard like you could give me my money back? And you\u2026 you dare to suspect me. Fine! I\u2019ll let you rot!\u201d\u201cForget it! I can save the money for gals, can\u2019t I\u2026 Lan Lang-Lang! Let\u2019s go!\u201d With anger, Ye Xiao stood up willing to leave, \u201cWe no longer have a friend like this bastard that never appreciates our kindness!\u201dLan Lang-Lang was always good at kicking up a row. He wouldn\u2019t let this chance go, so he stood up with a woosh, while shouting cheerfully, \u201cAbsolutely! We are never going to talk to this prick as he doesn\u2019t want to be our friend!\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 Please don\u2019t\u2026 brother Ye, brother Lan, stay! Ah please my dear brothers\u2026\u201d As fast as he could, Zuo Wu-Ji rushed forward and held Ye Xiao\u2019s waist tightly and apologized with a flattering tone, \u201cOhhh, I only said one tiny wrong word\u2026 Oh please, we are brothers right? We are brothers forever. You wouldn\u2019t really be mad at me, would you?\u2026 Ahhh come on just stay! Steward! Bring us some tea! The classy one! The best! The imperial tea the king awarded my grandpa with! Quick quick\u2026\u201dThen he respectfully seated Ye Xiao on the masters\u2019 chair of the house, while bowing with a servile smile, \u201cHey hey\u2026 brother Ye, hah hah, master Ye, brother, my dearest brother\u2026 Would you seriously lend me some money?\u201dYe Xiao was sitting with one ankle on his other knee, \u201cI was going to\u2026\u201d\u201cOh you can\u2019t change your mind bro\u2026\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji nearly kneeled down.He wouldn\u2019t give up the hard-found chance to rectify his mistake. God knows what kind of rough life he had been living for the past months\u2026 and he couldn\u2019t even escape because his tormentors were his own family.\u201cHumph, fair enough.\u201d Ye Xiao blew the leaves floating on the tea, with a poker face, \u201cSince I have already said it so soon, why don\u2019t you write me a receipt and give me whatever something as a guaranty. With that I will just give you 750 kilograms of gold\u2026 Let\u2019s make it clear, that you should return the money someday. Don\u2019t even try bargaining!\u201d\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d Zuo Wu- Ji said with a happy face, then he realized a problem and asked with a disconsolate look, \u201cBut what should I give you for guaranty?\u201d\u201cDo you understand human language? Anything could do, just give me something. We are brothers. I don\u2019t really want anything expensive from you, do I?\u201dZuo Wu-Ji suddenly felt relieved, \u201cIt is a good way indeed\u2026 Let me see. What should I steal this time?\u201dHe was rolling his eyes. Obviously he had decided to be the family thief one more time.\u201cOh, my!\u201d Ye Xiao instructed him feeling disappointed, \u201cCan you just be quick and pick any one of these collections in this house. It doesn\u2019t have to be costly. Anything will do\u2026\u201dAfter Ye Xiao\u2019s stark instruction, Zuo Wu-Ji finally came to an understanding all of a sudden, \u201cWell\u2026 then is it ok to be a guaranty?\u201d\u201cForget about the guaranty thing. That was what I meant. Come on, we are brothers!\u201d Ye Xiao was showing generousness and said with consideration.Zuo Wu-Ji was too happy to even close his mouth. He finally could get rid of the burden in his heart. He laughed heartily, \u201cWell then! Although every piece of this collection here was collected by my grandfather, and he loves them all\u2026 it wouldn\u2019t matter if one or two went missing \u2026 Bro, tell me which one you like. I\u2019ll directly give it to you! We won\u2019t take that back! I surely will pay back the money and you can keep whatever you choose!\u201dZuo Wu-Ji was truly very generous.Ye Xiao rightfully answered with a questioning brow, \u201cWhat do you mean? What do you think I am? I am only trying to help you. Do you think that I am hankering after your collection\u2026 You could give it to me as a gift after you get the money, as that shows your thankfulness. The gift itself may be small, but the goodwill is transferred. However, for now if I accept it, it will be seen as you bribing me!\u201d\u201cBribing?\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji thought with his mouth twitched, \u201cHow could he talk like he was an honorable officer.\u201d\u201cI am done with your dilatoriness. This one. I like the feeling of flying.\u201d What he was unconcernedly pointing at was exactly the Pure Heavenly Crystal.\u201cThat\u2026 That is too cheap, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji was suddenly moved and thought, \u201cIt looks like Ye Xiao is really trying to help me. There are so many treasures in the house and he actually has picked one of the cheapest. What a good man. Why didn\u2019t I realize it\u2026\u201d\u201cAll right, all right. You know my heart. That is enough.\u201d Ye Xiao said profoundly, \u201cWhat are we? Brothers should help each other\u2026 By the way, you should keep it as a secret, in case someone else knows that I have lend you lots of money\u2026 and they all come to me. It will be troublesome for me if I have to decide whether I should lend money to this one or that one.\u201d\u201cYou can count on me. I will keep my mouth completely shut!\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji promised, \u201cI am not that kind of person, am I\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you\u2026 just take it now?\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji was afraid Ye Xiao would change his mind, so he tried to force his hand.\u201cMoron!\u201d Ye Xiao reproached him with a low voice, \u201cCan you not think for yourself? Now if I take it right under these people\u2019s eyes in your house, how can we keep it a secret?\u201d\u201cRight, right.\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji then whispered to Ye Xiao, \u201cHow about I bring it out to you when the day turns dark?\u201d\u201cGreat idea!\u201d Ye Xiao answered full of praise, \u201cAt that time I will go to the corner of the alley south of here and I\u2019ll be waiting for you with the money.\u201dZuo Wu-Ji smiled when he heard this, \u201cI should thank you for this bro\u2026 As long as it saves my reputation in the family, I will at once get the money from the business and pay you back. Set your heart at ease. I am a man of my word!\u201d\u201cAll right dude. Could I give you my money if it were not for my trust in you?\u201d Ye Xiao and Zuo Wu-Ji were holding each other\u2019s shoulder as if they were the closest of brothers.Beside them with his jaws on the floor, Lan Lang-Lang was stupefied with the new developments.After all details were finalized, Zuo Wu-Ji respectfully saw Ye Xiao and Lan Lang-Lang off with endless gratitude while they left with smugness.\u201cWhen the day turns dark, just remember it bro.\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji shouted. Ye Xiao and Lan Lang-Lang heard the shout from Zuo Wu-Ji even though they had travelled quite far.\u2026\u2026\u201cHey listen, are you really going to give him the money?\u201d Lan watched Ye Xiao suspiciously, \u201cCome on\u2026 you are not a kind-hearted guy, are you? Are you going to walk away and betray that guy\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? You are such a flunky, while I have a tolerant heart! Do you think that I am someone like you who always breaks his word?!\u201d Ye Xiao looked at Lan with disdain, \u201cGo home and prepare a note for 500 kilogram of gold for me. I need it!\u201dIt seemed that he didn\u2019t have enough money to lend to Zuo Wu-Ji\u2026\u201cOh do you need it? Sure I will. Wait\u2026 What? What did you just say? You told me to prepare a note for 500 kilogram of gold, so that you can lend it to Zuo? Why should I? Give me a reason first!\u201d Lan exploded with fury when he had realized what Ye Xiao had exactly said.\u201cFor me to give the money to him, so that he can do some good deals. Why should I?!\u201d He thought.\u201cA reason? You can\u2019t even understand that! If you don\u2019t prepare the note for me, what do I lend to Zuo Wu-Ji? Isn\u2019t it obvious? You\u2019re being too talkative!\u201dYe Xiao rolled up his eyes, unconcernedly and slowly said with a threatening tone, \u201cLan Lang-Lang, if you don\u2019t bring me the note, causing me to break my word, that\u2019s ok. I will just tell your grandfather, your father, your mother and your aunt that you fought with Zuo Wu-Ji for a gal\u2019s favor in the brothel and ran around naked\u2026 If that is not enough for you, I can even paint some graffiti about you on every wall on the street! I shall make sure that you become famous. The whole city, no, even the whole world will know about you! I will let your reputation rise to the same level as Zuo Wu-Ji!\u201cWhat? You!\u201d Lan Lang-Lang was so angry that he nearly passed out. His eyes even turned normal due to his anger. He shouted as if bleeding, \u201cHow vicious are you? That is just taking my darkest experiences\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cUrrr\u2026 Stop it! How dare your refer to your infantile life as an experience? This deal eventually won\u2019t even cost you anything. Let me ask you again, will you do it or not?\u201d\u201cI WILL DO IT! What other choice do I have?\u201d Lan was nearly crying, \u201cI will bring it to you\u2026\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-[1] Swallow \u2026 with one\u2019s teeth and blood: A metaphor, means someone have gotten through something bad but can not say a word about it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Ye Xiao smiled with satisfaction, and turned left so as to make a detour into the alley. But just as he reached the corner, his senses were invaded by a terrifying feeling.\u201cHmm?\u201d Ye Xiao stopped immediately.He sensed immense danger!It was the instinct he had gained after experiencing countless life-and-death situations and ambushes. He had absolute trust in these instincts which he had developed after a lifetime of fighting.Ye Xiao knew that his instincts would not warn him with time to spare unless the situation was one of extreme peril.He could sense a large wave of cultivators coming towards him.And he was very near the place where the cultivators would converge.\u201cAre they coming for me?\u201d Ye Xiao frowned, and then shook his head, \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be\u2026 I am not qualified enough for them to make such a big move. They wouldn\u2019t be thinking too highly of me, would they?\u201dAt the same time, impatient footsteps were approaching from the opposite end of the alley. A murmur could be heard, \u201cYe Xiao will come, will he not? He won\u2019t play me off, right?\u201dIt was the voice of Zuo Wu-Ji.Obviously, he had arrived earlier and was waiting anxiously for Ye Xiao.His presence here made Ye Xiao eliminate him as a suspect. It meant that this ambush was planned by an unknown entity.\u201cAha\u2026 You\u2026\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji couldn\u2019t help but shout out loud when he saw Ye Xiao and he practically skipped towards him.\u201cHush!\u201d Ye Xiao covered his mouth hastily, \u201cDid you bring the item?\u201dZuo Wu-Ji nodded as his mouth was covered, and then took out a package from behind him.Ye Xiao could tell that this was the crystal without seeing it, he could feel it!Zuo Wu-Ji had pinched the crystal quite easily, perhaps as a result of him becoming used to thievery.\u201cHere\u2019s the note for 750 kilograms of gold. Remember to pay me back.\u201d Ye Xiao said as he exchanged the note for the package. He felt a huge sense of accomplishment.\u201cThank you sooooo much\u2026\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji nearly cried, \u201cBrother, a real good brother\u2026 From now on brother Ye, you are my best brother. I\u2026 I\u2026\u201dHe stuttered due to excitement.Thinking about giving the ruyi back to his father , saving his reputation and no longer remaining a sandbag for his father and grandfather\u2026 Zuo Wu-Ji had became very emotional \u201c\u2026 sniff, you really are my benefactor\u2026\u201d\u201cOh thank god! The title of the number one black sheep in the kingdom will be taken away from me soon. God knows how stressed I have been these past few days\u2026\u201d He thought.\u201cAll right now. Off you go quickly. Save your thanks for another day.\u201d Now that he got the crystal, Ye Xiao didn\u2019t want to spend another second in this alley.His instincts were practically screaming at him to get away.Luckily, Zuo Wu-Ji was even more eager to leave. \u201cBro, after the auction the day after tomorrow, I will be free again. After that, we must get a drink together.\u201d Said Zuo Wu-Ji, while running away.Now that he had a chance to save his reputation, he felt that he could not longer waste even a second of his remaining life.\u201cScrew that\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao was impressed, \u201cThe bastard runs even faster than me\u2026\u201dNow that the crystal he had dreamt of was finally in his grasp, Ye Xiao was one hundred percent satisfied. He turned around to leave the alley, while petting the crystal in the package.Suddenly, he felt a strong dizziness, which made him sway on the spot forcing him to hold his forehead.The remnent of poison within his body had gotten out of his control and begun its attack.\u201cI had completely suppressed it. How could it resurrect so quickly?\u201d He thought.The dizziness in his mind got stronger and stronger, and even showed slight eagerness, as if it was alive\u2026Ye Xiao had felt the dizziness get stronger, but had failed to notice the eagerness within the poison. He, however, wouldn\u2019t dare to consider its threat insignificant. He gnashed his teeth and took out his knife. He currently had no choices but to cut off a piece of the crystal and use it against the poison as it had grown vicious enough to take his life at a moment\u2019s notice. At this point, he really couldn\u2019t care about wasting some of the crystal because what he prioritized foremost was his own survival.A grinding sound could be heard as he cut off the surface covering the crystal. But he soon discovered that its insides were extremely hard. With his present strength, he could only manage to scrape off a little powder from it\u2019s surface.\u201cIt is actually that hard!\u201d Ye Xiao felt helpless as he swallowed the powder.Ye Xiao only had some second-hand knowledge about the crystal and hadn\u2019t even seen a piece of it prior to today, let alone swallow some of it. It was only at this moment that he found out about the crystal\u2019s hardness.It felt even harder than diamond!The moment he swallowed the powder, a fragrance emerged from the crystal in his arms. It made him feel refreshed. He inhaled the sweet smell with a deep breath and felt relaxed, and then\u2026Another kind of dizziness invaded his mind. He saw some golden words flashing within his mind. The very next moment, he felt the package become weightless. The crystal was gone!The package was indeed still in his arms!How can the crystal inside it disappear? It had vanished into thin air!Ye Xiao was gobsmacked! \u201cWhat the fxxk is going on?\u201d He could clearly feel that it wasn\u2019t a superhero who had stolen it right under his nose!Although he had lost all his powers, he wasn\u2019t lame enough to not notice someone whisk away his crystal!Maybe the crystal wasn\u2019t gone, but instead had merged into his body!But\u2026 How did it get inside his body?The size of this crystal was considerable. How did it get inside? From where?Ye Xiao really felt faint at that moment, not just physically but mentally. Suddenly a flow of energy rushed up from inside his energy center [1]!It all happened in a flash. Ye Xiao turned sweaty at once, which was a result of a huge amount of spiritual energy flowing inside his body! He clearly felt his pulse beat erratically, but struggling against it was futile.\u201cOh no this is bad!\u201d Ye Xiao was crestfallen.As an expert of cultivation, he had a very good idea of what he was facing. The suddenly arising energy definitely wasn\u2019t anything good. It was very likely that he would be screwed this time.The reason for this analysis was simple. The adventitious energy which had poured into his body was too rampageous. Ye Xiao was unable to contain it with his present condition. Although he had desired for more power, but this surely was overkill\u2026 he had no possibility of controlling it! He now regretted that he had contacted this thing. Although he had known the crystal to be very powerful, he had vastly underestimated its effects!The current situation was a million miles \u2013 no, even further away from what he had predicted\u2026 The only way to solve this problem was to let the rampaging power out of his body and let it disperse. Otherwise his body would be ruined. If the poison didn\u2019t kill him, the energy would\u2026 It had become a really shitty scenario!And at that moment\u2026BOOM! A bang was heard nearby. Fire was rolling up in the sky!The piercing sound of battle could now be heard. The sounds of the weapons colliding could be compared to thousands of blacksmiths forging their iron together. Ye Xiao now truly felt like crying.The thing he had most feared was now occurring. His intuition had been spot on \u2013 a battle was taking place in the Zuo Xiang Fu!And it was taking place right when he was in this awkward situation!Fortunately, those cultivators he had perceived earlier, turned out to be aiming for the Zuo Xiang Fu, not him.Unfortunately, the place where he was standing at right now was right next to the infiltrators\u2026He was already going through a lot and now he had managed to crash into this mess.He decided to do the only thing he was capable of doing, which was to cover his head using the package in his arms, creating a makeshift hood\u2026And then, he tried to get away\u2026The messy battle had absolutely nothing to do with him\u2026The sound of fighting was getting louder and louder. It could be easily made out that the force of the Zuo Xiang Fu had begun to fight back and currently held an advantage.A weird horn was heard. Ye Xiao frowned, \u201cA long sound which is then followed by three short, should be a sign of retreat\u2026\u201dA lot had happened just now, and he had only been able to reach the end of the alley \u2013 not that he didn\u2019t want to move faster, he just wasn\u2019t able to. Suddenly, a swordlight slashed right in front of him.It turned out to be that one of them had already strayed out and arrived here.He hacked his sword and indiscriminately tried to kill all who opposed him.And he easily succeeded in killing everyone standing in his path.Ye Xiao suddenly turned bitter, \u201cThese guys who wear black and cover their faces, could never be with the Zuo Xiang Fu. They moved quicker and are way more fierce than some ordinary warriors -they should be some extremely well trained killers!\u201dMaybe even more menacing than some well trained killers!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWhile Ye Xiao was collecting his thoughts, the killer didn\u2019t stop his merciless lightning like sword hacks!On account of the spiritual force of the killer moving forward, the power of his sword actually released a shiny green light. The surface of the alley wall was now shocked into pieces while some fissures had appeared on the ground. It was as if the sword\u2019s breath [2] had even torn the air apart.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014[1] One\u2019s energy center: Refer to the dantian in Chinese, at or below the navel in one\u2019s body.[2] Sword breath: The manifestation of energy from a sword that will come out when the sword movesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

With such an overbearing sword breath, the blade would not even need to connect, just the sword breath was sufficient to kill him!Although Ye Xiao had no powers left, he had retained his vision. He was seeing everything with great clarity at the moment. This particular attack was called the Mountain Cracking Strike in the cultivation of swordplay. If this sword actually hit him, nothing in his body would be left intact. It would be completely torn apart. There would be nothing left unbroken!\u201cWant to kill me with no reasons at all and even want to tear me apart?\u201dYe Xiao was angry. He was really furious.At this moment, the raging power within Ye Xiao\u2019s body had no means of dissipating and was currently circulating within his body which gave him the illusion of regaining his lost strength. He instinctively wielded his sleeve, and without thinking performed a \u201cLaughing Eight Blast\u201d in order to defend from the attack and fight back.He began to laugh while performing the Eight Blast!This was precisely The Xiao monarch\u2019s signature move.But it hadn\u2019t occurred to him until he had already executed the move: \u201cDamn it! I am no longer the Xiao Monarch of my previous life. No matter how surging my strength is, the spiritual power inside my body was all dependent on an external source. I can\u2019t use this power as I wish, I need to be frugal. But if I don\u2019t exert this power now, how can I defend and fight back?\u201dHowever, even he was surprised by what happened next.Now that the endless raging power had found a way to burst out, it began to pour out continuously and showed no signs of stopping!With a sharp sound, a powerful wind was created followed by a burst of purple light.At that moment, Ye Xiao had a feeling, it felt like an illusion where he was back to the best condition of his prior life!The Xiao Monarch who had laughed at all heroes, had he come back?Puff\u2026A slight sound came out. The guy who was rushing towards him was now incapable of executing any more crazy sword-moves. He was unable to attack anymore because he was rendered completely immobile by an invisible force which had emerged from Ye Xiao\u2019s Laughing Eight Blast. When faced with such force, even the sword in his hand was repelled and was made to turn around and smash the head of its owner with an undefendable power!The force from the Laughing Eight Blast had made the sword strike many times fiercer than when it had originally been released.The killer facing such misfortune, besides being scared enough to lose his countenance, was actually terrified to the extreme. Unfortunately, the killer was also experienced in battle. With quick reactions, he forced himself to correct his stance and to block the blade. Kacha! Both his hands were cut off at the same time. This action caused the back of the blade to hit his head instead of its sharp edge and made him bleed at once!Receiving a powerful shock, his whole body was sent flying away like a kite with a broken string. With a bang, he crashed into a wall and rebounded back to the floor. Although all his bones were likely to be broken, he had dealt with this crisis correctly and had managed to preserve his life.Ye Xiao had just wielded his sleeve and actually managed to get such a frightening win! He had managed to redirect the fearsome Mountain Cracking Strike just by a flick of his sleeves!\u201cThe grade of a Tian-yuan Master! \u2026 Who is he?\u201d The killers were shocked to a standstill. They were now facing a situation which had caused even the tone of their voice to change!\u201cMy bloody god. Being called out for a mission, I had almost finished it and returned. And now I just casually met someone in a narrow alley and he turned out to be the stuff nightmares are made off\u2026\u2026 What fxxing luck do I have\u2026\u201dThe power inside Ye Xiao\u2019s body was still raging like before. It hadn\u2019t slowed down at all, and even after the strike just now, it was still going berserk, and was about to explode. He gave a humph, and casually reached out with his hands into the air and grabbed. With a sound of a sword being unsheathed, the space in front of him distorted into a familiar shape. He had actually conjured a sword from thin air!When the spiritual power turns into the sword, everything becomes his weapon!The special move of the Xiao Monarch, Long Sky Laugh!While smiling, this attack was used to take lives and chase after the souls of the dead.\u201cThat move \u2013 creating a sword from thin air?! You can\u2019t be\u2026\u2026\u201d The killers in the enemy camp shouted out in panic, completely terrified while stepping back at the same time. They obviously knew that they were not qualified to fight, and tried to escape with their lives.But it was too late.Ye Xiao\u2019s eyes were filled with rage. He stepped forward and stabbed.Suddenly, a splendid ball of purple qi appeared, then burst out, like some purple gorgeous fireworks were exploding in the night sky . The sword breath had disappeared at once like it was trying to get back the one-thousand years time!\u201cUrh\u2026\u201d Weird stuffy sounds were heard. The killer who had swung the sword earlier and the two other killers who had followed him had gotten their necks slashed. With their eyes popping out, they used all their strength to hold on to the wounds before eventually falling down on the floor floppily.Triple kill with one sword move!\u201cStart from nothing, the purple skyline!\u201d The leader who was standing the farthest from Ye Xiao, had the chance to observe earlier. As the only survivor in the group, he was extremely anxious to get away, but he had received a large wound on his chest, and his eyes were filled with alarm. He was looking at Ye Xiao with a horror-stricken face, \u201cIt is actually you! Ning Bi-Luo! How dare you fight against us. Even though you are the No.1 killer in the world, our lord highness would never let you get away with this!\u201dYe Xiao was puzzled, \u201cNing Bi-Luo? Who is he? The No.1 killer? There actually is an elite cultivator in this mortal world\u2026\u201dBesides, the lord highness? What lord? Who is he?When he was going to finish this guy with a further attack so as to avoid troubles in the future, he felt the plentiful power which had been running restlessly in his body now was actually quickly calming down like refluence. The crisis of his Jing and Mai[1] exploding had passed and the rampage he had gone through had drained the power acquired through the powder from the Pure Heavenly Crystal.The spiritual power which didn\u2019t belong to him was not able to persist.Without the support of the continuous supply of spiritual power, the sword in his hand disappeared. Ye Xiao yelled, \u201cHumph, you\u2019ve mistaken my identity.\u201dThe Xiao Monarch was a proud cultivator who travelled the world above. What was right was right and what was wrong was wrong. He wouldn\u2019t let others to take his blame!However, the more he denied the truth, the more firmly the guy believed he was Ning Bi-Luo. With the mountain-like bearing of a master cultivator and the recognizable fighting style he had, if he wasn\u2019t the No.1 killer, who else could he be?The killer humphed and and said, \u201cNing Bi-Luo, there will be a chance for us to meet again. Wait and see!\u201d He did a backward somersault. Under extreme fear, he actually burst forth with unbelievable potential, and twisted his body to disappear into the darkness.He thought that it was fortunate that the monster \u2013 Ye Xiao didn\u2019t attack again\u2026 The face-covered killer was dripping cold sweat, believing that he had escaped with his life\u2026The sound of soldiers was getting closer and closer.\u201cI absolutely can\u2019t stay here any longer!\u201dThe killer was unaware that Ye Xiao also secretly elated, \u201cThe killer didn\u2019t attack me. I have really escaped with my life!\u201dIn Ye Xiao\u2019s estimation, the escaping killer was actually the one with the greatest strength among them, even greater than the one who had attacked him. If he had been brave enough to attack Ye Xiao, a fight would have been impossible with the power left within him.Although, the last bit of his power that hadn\u2019t disappeared was not enough to fight against the enemy, it was barely enough to run for his life. Ye Xiao dodged like a ghost, disappearing at once from the alley.This movement was actually the skill for which he was known for in his prior life as the Xiao Monarch: One Laughter in Skyline!Ye Xiao had gone over a hundred meters with a single dodge and heavily fell on the ground. The accidentally gained power in his body, was now completely used up.The Xiao Monarch in his best condition could go dozens of miles when he use the One Laughter in Skyline skill at full power, but now it was only about a hundred meters. It was a difference similar to heaven-and-hell.Although Ye Xiao felt like sighing with a certain dissatisfaction, he felt a surprising pleasure about escaping from that central zone of the battle. Besides, as a master of martial arts, he understood the reason why he had just moved such a short distance. It was not that his One Laughter in Skyline was lame but he was in a really poor condition and the spiritual power in his body was too little. All these disadvantages were combined. That\u2019s why the distance he had moved was so lame.Although, no expert had witnessed the godlike skill of moving for hundred meters with a single breath, if they had, they would surely have been shocked enough to drop their jaws to the floor!What he was unaware of was that- at the moment, it was not only the Zuo Xiang Fu which was in disarray, the entire capital was already falling into disorder!There were people shouting and horses neighing. Countless soldiers rushed on the street conducting a search for the escaping killers.\u201cCatch the assassins!\u201d\u201cDo not let the assassins go!\u201d\u201cSearch carefully! Let no suspects go!\u201d\u201cRather kill an innocent than let them escape!\u201dThis corner of the capital was the epicentre of the disorder. It was as if a huge rock had fallen into a peaceful lake and the ripples had spread across the whole city. The situation had the signs of getting more and more serious!Inside Ye Xiao\u2019s body, although the spiritual power was depleted, he still had the strength to move his legs, which was barely enough to enable him to walk on the street. By the time he got home, he was utterly exhausted to such a degree that he didn\u2019t even want to move his little finger\u2026In fact, he had gotten through god knows how many question kiosks, but everyone had recognised the foppish son of the Northern General. While they saw him walking close with a over drunk pace and a coxcombical look, what interest did they have to bother with him?Even if they were searching everyone, they would never suspect that one of the three lords would be involved, and hence, they won\u2019t bother to interrogate him.The Xiao Monarch had just reached the door at home, when he heard a voice yelling with anger, \u201cWhere have you been? At such a dangerous time you\u2019re actually still lingering around. I\u2019ll beat you to death! Arghhhhh\u2026\u2026\u201dAlthough the voice was filled with anger, it was delicate and sweet-sounding. It was the voice of a girl.Ye Xiao looked towards the source of the voice and saw two girls standing gracefully erect under the lanterns hanging in his house. The one in front was pouting her lips while furiously staring at him, but this angry look had an indescribable charm and glamour.The guard standing beside the door was showing a bitter face, \u201cMy Lord\u2026 The princess has come to see you\u2026\u201dYe Xiao immediately felt that his scalp burning. From the successive memory, he learned that this girl in front was indeed his fiancee that his present father selected for him. She was the daughter of the Royal Highness Hua-Yang, the well known princess Moon in the capital.\u201cHmmm, isn\u2019t it claimed that she is gentle, soft and virtuous? She just yelled like a female lion when seeing me. What is going on\u2026\u201dBefore he could react, his ear was grabbed by a soft small hand, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get in here!\u201dThe maids beside her were tittering away while covering their mouths. Ye Xiao was grabbed on the ear in an extremely awkward fashion and led through the door.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cOyi oyi. Take it easy\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao had a bitter face. It was only recently that all his power had been exhausted, now his body was at its weakest. He was really not going to make it\u2026\u201cSpeak! What have you been up to? Bastard!\u201d Princess Moon was looking at Ye Xiao who was facing her, with a tiger-like face.It really felt different to see a beauty under the light. The Princess Moon had a face like flowers, curved eyebrows, clear and clever eyes, firm nose and a little mouth like a cherry. Her hair was slightly rolled up on her head\u2026\u2026 She really was like a beauty from poems and paintings. Even though she was forcing an evil and scary look, she was still a stunning beauty, only one in millions. She had the ability to make a thousand faces and no one could recognize her true face.\u2014 \u2014 \u2014[1] Jing and Mai: Jing is the Chinese word for \u201cessence\u201d, specifically kidney essence.

The Xiao Monarch had spent his entire prior life cultivating the Pure Yang Martial Arts[1], so he hadn\u2019t spent any time with women. As for now, there was a beautiful girl standing in front of him; a girl who was pretty no matter if she was angry or happy. His mind suddenly felt a little blank and his tongue seemed dull.Thuck!Ye-Yue swung her hand and struck Ye Xiao\u2019s head. She shouted hysterically, \u201cThere is a disturbance going on right now and you were actually hanging around outside? Do you know there is a serious event happening in the capital today? If you keep staying out on the street, you may carelessly get yourself killed somewhere! Uncle Ye had given me a whip when he was leaving, so I have the right to discipline you. If you dare to oppose me, I will lash you with it!\u201dYe Xiao was thinking, \u201cYou sure have some guts! How dare you threaten me \u2013 the Xiao Monarch?! Maybe I should lash you to death instead!\u201dBut he decided to feign ignorance, \u201cReally? What is going on in the capital?\u201dYe-Yue humphed, rolled her eyes and said while gloating, \u201cI heard that Zuo Xiang Fu was raided\u2026 Many thieves had broken in and The Minister Zuo who has now lost a lot of priceless things is in a violent temper at the moment\u2026 Now all military forces in the capital are mobilized to guard the nine gates of the capital so that no one can get in or out. They are searching for the assassins and trying to arrest them with their loots.\u201dThe princess was actually tittering and then she caught herself losing manner and stateliness in front of Ye Xiao, so she pretended to cough slightly to regain composure and said, \u201cIt looks like the lord Minister Zuo will suffer a great loss. To catch the assassins and retrieve the stolen goods and recover his loss is proving to be really difficult\u2026\u201dYe Xiao rolled his eyes and said, \u201cDo you know what treasures were stolen from him?\u201d\u201cI have no idea, but it should be something very valuable. Otherwise why would he make such a big movement?\u201d Ye-Yue shook her head.Ye Xiao thought, \u201cThe thing I got\u2026 Could it be what they were aiming for?He thought and thought again, \u201cI should probably make a duplicate of this sculpture with a different material when I get a chance. In case Zuo Wu-Ji asks it back sometime in the future. Carefulness keeps a boat sailing for thousands of years\u2026\u201d\u201cListen! You are not allowed to attend the auction taking place the day after tomorrow. I have invited some of my sisters to go and play with me. If you are there, you will definitely bring shame to me! Furthermore, you are not allowed to go to the Wen-Hua Event later this week either\u2026 Anyway, there is nowhere you can go in this period of time. Do you understand? Will you keep it in mind? Do you hear me?!\u201dThe girl made threatening gestures for a while before feeling satisfied as she saw Ye Xiao nod repeatedly. She stood up and started to leave.Then she sighed and said with a nearly inaudible voice, \u201cAyy\u2026 You are actually not that annoying\u2026 but if only you try to behave yourself and change all those shortcomings, how nice would it be\u2026 Ayyy\u2026\u201dUnder Ye Xiao\u2019s gaze, Ye-Yue got on the sedan chair [2] and went further and further in the dim light of night.Ye Xiao felt vaguely helpless from deep within his heart towards this girl.Following orders from her parents, listening to the words from the matchmakers, a girl would never have the right to choose her husband. Although the girl was born in a noble family, she had no right to make a decision in regards to her own marriage.Since her parents had betrothed her to Ye Xiao, she would marry him sooner or later.However, it was unlucky for her that her fiancee was such a foppish playboy. There was nothing she could do but sigh\u2026But it could be seen that Ye-Yue wasn\u2019t totally heartless to the prior Ye Xiao. After all they grew up together\u2026 Otherwise she would not have worry so much that she had even come here to show her concern at such a dangerous time\u2026Her sweet scent was still in the air. Ye Xiao couldn\u2019t help sighing and his heart was filled with an indescribable feeling \u2013 it was a feeling he had never felt before\u2026\u2026\u2026Ye Xiao lied down when he got back to his room, dropped the alertness of his mind briefly and suddenly felt completely exhausted, as if he was dying. He felt faint as if his body was empty; he did use up all of his energy for the escape a few hours ago\u2026 Besides, he had even coped with Ye-Yue just now, so the moment when he relaxed, he instantly felt difficult to hold on.The poison in his body was not yet cured. It was like a sharp blade hanging around his neck. Although the Pure Heavenly Crystal he had just used had entered his body for a short time, it had restrained the poison to a certain extent \u2013 and now, just with a push, the poison could be totally forced out of his body.The sooner he removed the hidden danger, the better. Ye Xiao calmly and patiently controlled the remaining spiritual power in his body. Although the extreme burst before had consumed ninety-nine percent of the spiritual power which had originated from the Pure Heavenly Crystal, a tiny little bit of it still remained in Ye Xiao\u2019s body. Fortunately, Ye Xiao scored a lucky hit. This tiny dissociative spiritual power was actually an amount which he could control and apply freely at present.Ye Xiao was leading the spiritual power to cover up the poison completely in the Jing and Mai. Tiny pieces of the dissociative power from the Pure Heavenly Crystal got together in his Dantian. Then the powers went through the Jing and Mai all around his body from the Dantian. The stubborn Qing-Ming Fruit poison was soon covered up and flowing out through the Jing and Mai.The poison that was acknowledged incurable in the mortal world was actually covered by a thin layer of spiritual power and compelled out of his body! If cultivators in this world saw this, they would definitely be shocked enough to drop their jaws to the floor!Finally, Ye Xiao felt a swelling pain in his whole Jing and Mai and, with a puff, he opened his mouth and spat out some black blood. The blood dropped on the floor with an indescribable stink!The whole floor suddenly turned black.At that moment, the Qing-Ming Fruit poison had finally been dispelled completely!Ye Xiao just felt relieved, \u201cThis god damn poison has finally cleared up.\u201dThe relief he had felt at this moment was truly indescribable.He could finally have a good night\u2019s rest after this\u2026\u2026 At least he wouldn\u2019t need to worry about getting killed by the poison anymore.Ye Xiao lied down and relaxed his whole body to have a good rest to restore his strength\u2026However, the next moment, -Wooosh! He got up and sat on the bed instantly.Because when he just lied down, he felt several words appearing in his mind.Some golden words!Where had he seen them? \u2026Ye Xiao recalled that when he first got the Pure Heavenly Crystal, he felt dizzy once and there seemed to be some golden words appearing in his sight, then the crystal had completely disappeared\u2026Ye Xiao hastily sat upright and tried to transfer his soul power. Then, to his delight, he discovered that he could actually circulate his soul power again!Besides, from within his sea of consciousness, there came a strong attraction force\u2026Shock instantly replaced the usual calm and collected gaze on Ye Xiao\u2019s face.The sea of consciousness was enshrouded in mist. Above the mist, there was a peculiar sphere shining in all its splendor.One after another, wave of purple qi came from the sphere flowing away.\u201cThis\u2026 Isn\u2019t this the sphere that I had randomly stumbled upon when I was exploring the Death Domain in Qing-Yun Realm? When did it get into my sea of consciousness? What is going on?!\u201dYe Xiao opened his eyes wide. He had no idea how such a thing could have happened.However, a plausible explanation started to brew in his mind, \u201cIs it even possible that\u2026 In the final battle of my prior life, I should have died completely, but instead, I got reincarnated here without any reasons. Could this be the doing of this peculiar sphere?\u201d\u201cOr could it be, that this Pure Heavenly Crystal consequently fulfilled a certain requirement of this peculiar sphere\u2026 so it finally decided to reveal itself?\u201dYe Xiao was very well-informed. He admitted that his suggestion was ridiculous, but he was ninety percent sure that he had got it right. Otherwise, everything would become unexplainable.If something as ridiculous as rebirth could happen, was anything else really impossible?!There was another faint thought brewing inside Ye Xiao\u2019s mind \u2013 this sphere could not be something simple!Neither its origin nor its functions would be simple!\u201cMaybe\u2026 It is highly possible that after I failed to walk on the road to the top in my last life, I will once more proceed on the path of cultivation in this new life, and the path starts with this sphere?\u201dYe Xiao was imagining with whimsicality. Although he knew that his thought was ridiculous, he was filled with eagerness. Even the well-informed Xiao Monarch had never heard of such a strange thing before!Ye Xiao gazed at the sphere in his sea of consciousness and remained puzzled after pondering over it a hundred times. Something which he had randomly found before was actually an earthshaking treasure? How could he not have realized it before?At that moment, Ye Xiao\u2019s eyes suddenly lit up!It felt like a huge bolt of lightning which could split the earth and the sky, was striking him!After the lightning struck, everything turned white!Right at that moment, Ye Xiao felt his body shake and a ball of light appeared in his mind!The light was turning bigger and bigger. Step by step, he found that all the lights wereoriginating from this ball!It was like a sun rising in the horizon of his sea of consciousness.The ball rolled and ten golden words abruptly appeared, shining in front of the ball! It shined right into Ye Xiao\u2019s eyes!All of the pain in his body had vanished, as if a miracle had happened at that moment.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cPeerless lord in the world, and foremost spirit in chaos!\u201d [3]\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014[1] In Chinese philosophy, yin and yang describes how opposite or contrary forces are actually complementary, interconnected, and interdependent in the natural world, and how they give rise to each other as they interrelate to one another.

What terrified Ye Xiao was that his soul followed the shrinking and also drew into the sphere!\u201cThe sphere is obviously inside my body. How could it draw me in? What is going on?\u201d When the confusion had just aroused in Ye Xiao\u2019s mind \u2013 woosh! his consciousness fell into a curious space.After being blank for a short time, Ye Xiao quickly regained his composure. He looked around and saw a huge palace standing like mountains with clouds curling around!Right below the palace there were two giant doors made of two huge white jades. The surface of the doors was smooth like a mirror \u2013 there was nothing on it!When Ye Xiao was checking carefully, he heard a sound \u2013 whoosh! A character was like a meteor flew from beyond the horizon and crashed on the blank doorframe of the left door!\u5929 \u2013 Tian!And then another character fell.Ye Xiao was already prepared to see them. He looked at those characters flying down and embedding themselves on the doorframe of both sides. They were exactly the ten words he just saw \u2013 \u5929\u5730\u65e0\u53cc\u4e3b\u3001\u6df7\u6c8c\u7b2c\u4e00\u7075 (Peerless lord in the world, and the foremost spirit in chaos)!After that, more words started showing up one by one on the white-jade doors.\u201cFrom heaven to hell, there is only one absolute ruler. But who is he?\u201d\u201cWhen the universe was just born, the sphere showed up. It took all efforts of creating and energy of the whole space to create such things. It brought about all livings beings \u2013 the sun, moon and stars in the sky, and the mountains and rivers on the earth\u2026\u201dIt was such a long text.Ye Xiao read it and felt confused, \u201cThe words inside the sphere are really overstated, are they not? The sun, the moon and the stars could be all created by you huh?That\u2026 is impossible\u2026Who do you think you are, a god? A sage? Or a sovereign being?\u201dThe next moment, the closed doors suddenly opened!An extremely dense fog flooded out!And beyond the fog was a long tunnel.As Ye Xiao was about to enter,golden flashing lights suddenly appeared in front of his face showing a line of words.\u201c\u6b32\u5165\u6b64\u95e8, \u751f\u6b7b\u4e00\u5ff5 (Enter, gain absolute power or face total annihilation)!\u201dYe Xiao stopped walking and looked at them attentively.After the eight words, there came another twelve flashing like they were directly carved in his mind.\u201c\u4e0d\u6210\u5929\u5730\u4e3b\u5bb0\uff0c\u4fbf\u5316\u5b87\u5b99\u5c18\u57c3 (Either become the absolute ruler of the universe or yet another insignificant speck of dust in the world!)!\u201dYe Xiao felt shocked deep inside his heart!It was a clear statement: If you get in here, you have decided to accept this legacy, and you will only have a single way out \u2013 by becoming the absolute ruler of the universe.If he couldn\u2019t succeed, he would become a speck of dust!Withering away!In simpler terms: If he failed, he would die!The condition was really taking it to the extreme.Live or die!There was no other option to consider.Ye Xiao stood silently for a while and said with a low voice, \u201cA single man in the world should have dominated everything! Even if I fail, at least I would have fought once. I may die, but with no regrets! A speck of dust, so what? A deadwood, so what? Life is inherently like a leaf living through autumn!\u201d\u201cIf I succeed, I will be the absolute ruler!\u201dHe leisurely walked through the doorway with his hand folded behind his back.He actually disdained looking at those warnings flashing around him.Success would let him look down upon the universe while failure would lead him to annihilation!He felt as if his blood was boiling and he was filled with an indescribable desire!\u201cThere it is, a method, a way back into the Qing-Yun realm. The three factions, wait and see! I, the Xiao Monarch, will return soon!\u201dA place filled with warnings like these were just a perfect fit for his personality! \u2014 Succeed or die!That was actually what he had done in his previous life!However, the present Xiao Monarch was perhaps even more resolute than he\u2019d ever been!\u201cHere it is!\u201d Above the empty main hall, there was a strange zone. The Pure Heavenly Crystal was right at its center and was slowly spreading wave after wave of heavy fog. This heavy fog was filling the main hall and the purple qi from the hall was slowly entering the Pure Heavenly Crystal.\u201cI was right! They are connecting with each other, stimulating each other, and then building up a regular cycling pattern.\u201d Ye Xiao pondered. Although he didn\u2019t understand what was really going on, he could see that inside the sphere, the Pure Heavenly Crystal was actually the catalyst for the sphere\u2026Ye Xiao tried to take the Pure Heavenly Crystal but found himself unable to reach it.\u201cWhat the hell is this?! I had battered my brains to obtain that thing and now I can\u2019t even touch it?\u201d Ye Xiao was a bit pissed.After finding the Pure Heavenly Crystal inside the sphere, Ye Xiao started to look at his surroundings. He realized that even though he had entered a huge palace, he had actually only explored a very small part of it. The rest of the buildings behind were still shrouded by the heavy fog. One couldn\u2019t even see his fingers clearly, let alone tell directions.DAANGG! Suddenly, a ringing sound filled the air, like the melodious sound of an evening drum or a morning bell\u2026Ye Xiao felt his mind go blank after hearing this ring. He attained a shocking enlightenment which had truly appeared from nowhere. He could clearly feel that the bell\u2019s ring was leading him through thousands of his past lives!At that moment, the thousands of lifetimes turned into a ray of light that rapidly flew through Ye Xiao\u2019s sight!It seemed both real and dreamlike at the same time; seemingly existing in front of him, yet impossible to reach\u2026The purple qi continued to expand till the ringing sound died out. A wave of the purple qi thrust up from the central grounds and formed ten words!\u201c\u5929\u5730\u521d\u59cb\uff0c\u552f\u6709\u7d2b\u6c14\u4e1c\u6765 (At the very beginning of the universe, only the purple qi from the east was in existance)\uff01\u201dAn extreme dense purple qi suddenly rose with splendid lights surrounding it. As sudden as lightning, it thrust forward and landed in between Ye Xiao\u2019s eyes!Instantly, Ye Xiao felt his head becoming heavy as a martial arts method quickly took shape within his mind\u201c\u4e07\u7269\u5f97\u9020\u5316\uff0c\u7d2b\u6c14\u4e1c\u6765\u529f!\u201d (The creation of the universe depends on the East-rising Purple Qi!)\u201c\u5929\u5730\u521d\u59cb\uff0c\u7d2b\u6c14\u4e1c\u6765\uff0c\u662f\u4e3a\u4e07\u7269\u4e4b\u6bcd\uff0c\u6ecb\u6da6\u82cd\u7a79\u22ef\u22ef\u6b64\u7d2b\u6c14\u63d0\u805a\u4e4b\u6cd5\uff0c\u6b63\u5fc3\u6b63\u795e\uff0c\u6211\u5fc3\u4e3a\u5929\uff0c\u9634\u9633\u8f6c\u52a8\uff0c\u4e09\u5149\u5408\u4e00\uff0c\u7075\u53f0\u51b0\u6e05\uff0c\u7d2b\u6c14\u4e1c\u6765\u3002\u201d(At the beginning of the universe, there was a purple qi rising from the east. It is the mother of the world and the benefactor of the firmament\u2026 The method of cultivating the purple qi strengthens the heart and refines the soul. My heart is the heaven; Yin and Yang are revolving; three lights are converging; my soul is crystal clear; the purple qi rises from the east.)\u2026\u2026\u201cThe East-rising Purple Qi!\u201dYe Xiao read this method word for word and sentence for sentence. Eventually, within his mind, he found enlightenment. It felt like finding a treasure!The Xiao Monarch had earned such a great title in his prior life. While the strong basic cultivation of him was an ascent to transcendence, the method of martial arts he had been using was also something out of the ordinary. His discernment was also surely a transcendental skill. In Ye Xiao\u2019s eyes, no matter if this East-rising Purple Qi was the first martial arts method in the universe or not, it was much better than the Pure Yang Martial Arts he had used in his prior life. The two methods were totally not in the same level; they were like cloud and soil. Even saying that the East-rising Purple Qi was in the sky and the Pure Yang Martial Arts was on the earth, was actually flattering the latter one. They absolutely belonged in different realms!Just by reading the beginning of this method, it had made him feel its endless power.He was sitting on the bed, wholeheartedly performing the new cultivating method again and again. He was transferring the poor small piece of spiritual qi into the route of the new method and began cultivating\u2026The scattered spiritual qi in the world converged towards his body, then gradually entered within him and flowed towards his dantian\u2026Inside the sphere, the Pure Heavenly Crystal was still persistently emitting the pure qi. The space materialized while the purple qi kept on spreading\u2026Ye Xiao sat on his bed the entire night!Ye Xiao remembered clearly, when he was performing the new martial arts method for the 1999th time, suddenly, with a buzz, his soul seemed to shake and all his acupoints[1] opened at once! The qi from all over the world crazily rushed into his body.His dantian was holding the scattered qi from this world and there was a wave of faintly discernible cool energy forming an extremely tenacious thread flowing into his Jing and Mai!That was an energy created by the mixture of the sphere and the Pure Heavenly Crystal \u2014 the first piece of the saint spiritual power!When the normal qi got into his dantian, they merged together. If both strings would be compared, then the normal string would be made of some normal silk, while this saint spiritual power would be a strand of superior silk that could hold a thousand kilograms.That was like the absolute difference between a god and a mortal!The difference between Heaven and hell!While Ye Xiao was cultivating by absorbing the East-rising Purple Qi, his skin gradually excreted layers of sticky mucus which was black and smelly\u2026Ye Xiao didn\u2019t move one bit, seemingly unaware of his body getting dirtier and dirtier. An inexplicable excitement was engulfing his mind!His condition right now, was actually what most cultivators could only dream about \u2014 ablution of the muscles and bones!This is the first step on the long journey of cultivation. If he had been using normal methods, he would need to reach an unimaginable high level before he would be able to enter the ablution stage in order to transform his mortal body into a saint-body.Surprisingly the East-rising Purple Qi actually started the ablution right at the beginning!He had really found an unimaginable treasure.Maybe it was true that this method was the first martial arts method in the universe, like it was said in its description!\u2026\u2026The next morning, when the sky was still dark, Ye Xiao hurried out from his room and jumped into the pond.Splash!!!In the pond, several big fish were scared by the unexpected visitor and walloped around.Ye Xiao actually had no other choice. He had just woken up from cultivating and had found himself stinking like a shit hole!God knows how much dirt was inside the body of this foppish playboy. This time all the filthy things had been exuded and formed a heavy layer on his body\u2026Ye Xiao even felt that his eyes were totally covered by filth\u2026He casually rubbed his body and removed a handful of dirt\u2026 and he rubbed again then got a miters long finger-width strip of them\u2026 People who didn\u2019t know what was going on would think that Lord Ye was catching a catfish in the pond of his house\u2026The stinky smell was being spread out by the wind. Anyone who smelled it would definitely puke immediately!The smell was just too strong! There was even a guard who, while covering his nose, had come to see what was going on, but he was berated away by Ye Xiao, \u201cDon\u2019t you see I am having a bath? What have you come for?\u201dThe guard began to run away in an attempt to save his nose while scolding: \u201cShit! I know you are having a bath, but there are two questions ok? The first: Don\u2019t you think it is too early to take a bath before sunrise? The second: I fxxking know you are taking a bath but it smells like somebody\u2019s washing the toilet!!!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe pond in the General Ye\u2019s house was really big. It was enormous!However, when Ye Xiao got out of the pond and looked back, all the fish in the pond were floating on the surface of the water, showing their white bellies and breathing the fresh air as if suffocating, with their mouths moving\u2026If those fish could talk, they would cry before talking, \u201cWhat the fxxk?! This is some nasty shit\u2026 I-Is this the end?\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014[1] Acupoints: Acupoints are locations on the body that are the focus of acupuncture, acupressure, sonopuncture and laser acupuncture treatment.

He had finally began the journey of cultivating the number one martial arts method since the beginning of time \u2013 the East-rising Purple Qi!He tried using a normal method to circulate the power he had gained from cultivation. As he guided his qi towards his palm, it started to shine with a bright primrose yellow light.\u201cLevel 1 in the Grade of Diyuan!\u201dYe Xiao felt relieved. What a nice surprise!He had realized that this mortal world was quite different from the Qing-Yun Realm that he had stayed in during his previous life. In Qing-Yun Realm, the lowest grade was the Grade of Lingyuan. When he was in his prior life, he had reached the top in the Grade of Daoyuan, which was the highest level in the Qing-Yun Realm.However, in this mortal world, it began with the Grade of Renyuan.The Grade of Renyuan, Grade of Diyuan and Grade of Tianyuan were the only three grades in the mortal world at the moment. Above the Grade of Tianyuan, it was the Grade of Lingyuan, which only appeared in the Qing-Yun Realm.The nine levels in the Grade of Renyuan were the nine steps to become a hero. The nine levels in the Grade of Diyuan were like nine mountains that were, one after the other, harder and harder to climb. The nine levels in the Grade of Tianyuan were like nine different clouds at various heights while each upgrade equaled a step closer to heaven!\u201cLevel 1 in the Grade of Renyuan allows people to establish themselves in the mortal world; level 5 would allow one to get wealthy; Aside from life and death, all routes in this world lead to the 9th level. The level that officially lets you truly stand apart from ordinary people!\u201dA man in the Grade of Diyuan could be called a real cultivator. People who had reached this grade usually had already achieved numerable accomplishments\u2026 However, in the Grade of Diyuan, to level up could be compared to climbing the tallest, most challenging mountains in the world..\u201cSo in fact I have already become stronger than ordinary people\u2026 I deserve to be called a real cultivator now\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao actually started to show a slight trace of complacency.In his prior life, he had spent a full year to cultivate himself from level 1 in the Grade of Renyuan to level 1 in the Grade of Diyuan. This time however, it only took him one day!\u201cSuch speed\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao was rubbing his chin and felt a bit lightheaded. A cultivation speed like this was something he wouldn\u2019t dare to dream about in his past life.Although he knew that it was the benefit of being a cultivator of the East-rising Purple Qi, he was still satisfied enough that he wouldn\u2019t regret dying again for it. Only those who had cultivated themselves before knew the difficulties of increasing their strength\u2026Although the former Ye Xiao \u2013 the foppish playboy \u2013 was ignorant, he had practiced some spiritual kung fu under pressure from his father. He was more or less at level 3 in the Grade of Renyuan. There was a silver lining found after living in the General\u2019s House after all. The departed lord Ye had a certain amount of qi inside his body, however, there were too many impurities in it.\u201cIt is good he had created a base for me, although he had debilitated his body so much that I don\u2019t even want to look at it\u2026 However, at least I have a body and am alive.\u201d Since he was very satisfied at the moment, he didn\u2019t wish to dwell on it.\u201cI wonder\u2026 Would there be any other functions in the sphere?\u201d Ye Xiao was in good spirits.While enjoying the progress he achieved in cultivation, he was more interested in the Pure Heavenly Crystal. He had only just entered the space inside the sphere and used the qi obtained from the Pure Heavenly Crystal, yet the ablution of his muscles and bones had already taken place. This was truly wondrous! Moreover, the waste-like body had broken into the Grade of Diyuan because of it.\u201cWhat if\u2026 What if I take another piece, what would happen\u2026 like, I want to laugh hehe hehe heh\u2026\u201dThinking of that, he reentered the sphere. Ye Xiao walked straight to where the Pure Heavenly Crystal was located and looked up. He rubbed his chin and thought, \u201cShall I\u2026 cut off another piece?\u201dYe Xiao thought of something and immediately took action. He jumped up and reached his hands out to grab the Pure Heavenly Crystal\u2026He had previously failed to cut the crystal with a knife, but now that he had the power of the Grade of Diyuan. He thought, \u201cThis time I can finally fiddle with this tough thing no matter what!\u201dHowever\u2026Booom!Purple lights attacked him at once.Ye Xiao was blown onto the floor and nearly got his hip decimated into eight pieces. The shock, however, made him oblivious to the screaming pain of his body.The Pure Heavenly Crystal was right in front of him and could be clearly seen.But\u2026 He might be able to lay his eyes upon it, but it was still far beyond reach. He couldn\u2019t reach it no matter what he tried!That wasn\u2019t all, the moment he had tried to lay his hands on it, he was cruelly beaten away by the purple lights coming from within the Pure Heavenly Crystal\u2026\u201cWhat the hell is going on? This thing had cost me innumerable hardships to obtain and now that it has finally become mine, I can only look at it from a distance?! Is there still justice?!\u201d Ye Xiao was kneading his hip with frustration flashing across his face.He wouldn\u2019t give up just like this and gave it another shot, but the results were the same.Ye Xiao was frustrated after being beaten down time and again, with dirt smeared all over his face, \u201cIt really is impossible to reach!\u201dLooking up at the highly standing Pure Heavenly Crystal, Ye Xiao sighed and groaned, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen something like this shit\u2026 I got it and it is in my place. It is obviously mine, but it actually won\u2019t let me touch it! You\u2026 ratty space in the sphere, can you be reasonable?\u201dAfter trying a few more times, Ye Xiao feebly lied down on the floor of the space.He finally understood. Even though he could get the Pure Heavenly Crystal into this sphere, his level was too low to take charge of this space. He didn\u2019t have the right, or should we say power, to rule here.Ye Xiao knew clearly that using such a treasure like the Pure Heavenly Crystal for now would really be a huge waste! Although it could immediately boost his cultivation to unimaginable heights, it could bring some hidden troubles with it. After all, it strength didn\u2019t come from arduous cultivation then a cultivators base was doomed to be weak. It would be a difficult journey for him to get back to the status of his power growing endlessly.However\u2026 the chance to achieve a meteoric rise in a single night was so alluring that no one would be resist it at all. As it was within sight but beyond reach for now, he no longer held any interests for it.\u201cFine. This place will make for a fine storage room.\u201d Ye Xiao settled for the second best option in an attempt to comfort himself.Then he exited the space, grabbed a chair outside and tried to take it back into the space within the sphere\u2026\u201cErhh, no?\u201d Ye Xiao looked at the chair in his hand and scratched his head.\u201cIs it too big? Maybe a smaller one will do.\u201dYe Xiao grabbed a stone about the size of an egg.But\u2026 it failed once again.\u201cWhat is the problem?\u201d Ye Xiao was really confused.\u201cEven I can get in, how come this small stone can\u2019t?!\u201dHe tried it once again!He had tried for several times until he shifted his attention and took a jade-crystal, which contained the essences of the universe and was left to him by his father, and at this point finally something happened\u2026It was not that the jade-crystal could enter the space, however\u2026\u201cIt lost some\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao looked at the jade-crystal which he held and found that something had changed, making him feel both happy and annoyed.Normal people may not have been able to tell the difference, Ye Xiao on the other hand obviously felt it. The jade-crystal didn\u2019t look different \u2013 it retained the same scale and the same sheen. However, the most essential qi it was harboring was gone, so it had become nothing more than a pillow with an embroidered case \u2014 pretty to look at, yet absolutely useless.\u201cCould it be that this space only accepts certain higher-class things\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao started to analyze it, \u201cThat means, every fancy treasure needs to be higher than a certain class to be able to enter this space. This fade-crystal is quite an example. Except for the most essential part of it, the rest is below the required class, so it can\u2019t get in!\u201dYe Xiao rubbed his chin and was thoughtful for a while, \u201cThis thing is picky with its food, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cTo absorb the essence of the sky and the earth and to gather the qi from everything, so as to expand the space and feed yourself. Only then can you become the unparalleled Monarch of this unbound space\u2026 This is the first temple of the unbinded space. To open the second temple, you need to master the second degree of East-rising Purple Qi.\u201d Ye Xiao had finally found some words on the wall.In other words, it was telling Ye Xiao that he should go get more valuable things to expand the space in this sphere before it could feed him back. Such circulation would cause both of them to improve.\u201cHmm humph, so there it is\u2026\u201d At this moment, Ye Xiao couldn\u2019t help but frown, \u201cAt the moment I just started with the East-rising Purple Qi, and I am even not at the first degree; I am only at the beginner\u2019s degree.\u201dAs for the present circumstance, he couldn\u2019t know what the requirements would be to enter this second temple.The Grade of Diyuan only corresponded with the beginner\u2019s degree; it should at least be the supreme master\u2019s level in the Grade of Tianyuan to achieve the second degree.A question started to form in his head, \u201cHow many degrees of the East-rising Purple Qi were there?\u201dFollowed by another question, \u201cWhat degree would be the maximum he could possibly reach?\u201d\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao sighed deeply.A vast and hazy future had appeared in front of him. There was still a seemingly endless road for him to travel!But in any case, the East-rising Purple Qi was absolutely thousands of times stronger than what he had been practicing in his previous life! Anyway, he would practice it to the supreme level and cultivate it even further!The urgent question now was\u2026 where could he get all of the treasures which he was going to need?From all the things around him in the General\u2019s House, only the jade-crystal could barely be considered worthy \u2014 it was only a partial pass at best \u2014 what a tragedy!\u201cIf you give me nothing, how can I obtain countless treasures?\u201d Ye Xiao felt depressed and sighed deeply at the space, \u201cEven if a treasure shows up, it will be in the hands of a noble family and used as tribute to coax someone like the king. Even if there would really be one that was worthy\u2026 I would still need the money to make the deal. If I were at a higher level, I could just go and rob it\u2026 but I am a mere weakling for now. If I go rob a top-level treasure to expand this shitty space, I am afraid that a single fart from the enemy will instantly kill me. What am I even complaining about?\u201d A wonderful housewife could never cook a meal if she had no rice [1], just like Ye Xiao now, he also couldn\u2019t do something if he wasn\u2019t capable.No one knew whether the space was disgusted by the pathetic tone of some Monarch or not, however, there was the purple qi floating in the air and the space was shaking. On the west corner of the space, a deep and serene tunnel appeared.Ye Xiao went blank when he saw this. He was just simply grumbling, he didn\u2019t actually expect any reaction from it.\u201cIs it because I am too pathetic so the gods showed pity for me? Oh no, I mean the space showed pity for me!\u201dHe walked through the tunnel and saw a purple colored table at the end of it. On this purple colored table there was a lotus pedestal and at the center of the pedestal, there was a\u2026An egg?Endless purple qi was coming out from inside the lotus pedestal and going into the egg while the surplus qi frantically flew away\u2026\u201cErhh\u2026 an egg? No\u2026 a duck egg?\u201d Ye Xiao was looking at the egg on the table and felt really confused.It was obviously an egg!Yet it was slightly bigger than an egg. Well if there was an egg with two yolks\u2026 it could be about this big.\u201cWhat kind of being could be in this egg?\u201d Ye Xiao was stretching out his hand to pick up and see the egg up close, but when he reached it, he shockingly found himself unable to pick it up. He quickly triggered all his powers to pick it up apprehensively\u2026BAMMYe Xiao fell down on the floor!He still couldn\u2019t pick it up. He actually still couldn\u2019t do it!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIt was nothing but a small egg. For Ye Xiao\u2019s cultivation now \u2014 he at least could carry up to a thousand kilograms \u2014 yet he actually couldn\u2019t pick it up!\u201c!!!!!\u201d Ye Xiao goggled widely, unable to utter a single word.The next moment, he felt a burning sensation in his heart.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014[1] Something like if you have no hand you can\u2019t make a fist.

What if it hatches\u2026 heh heh heh\u2026\u201dAll of a sudden, Ye Xiao\u2019s eyes filled with an endless desire.Such happiness!\u201cHahahahahaha\u2026 How could I\u2019ve ever thought that anything inside this quirky place would be ordinary?!Only a super mythical creature, would be able to brazenly leave its egg here, wouldn\u2019t it?Look at the table\u2026 Hmm, obviously all the qi in this space is gathering here to feed this egg. Only a fraction of the qi arriving at this egg got rejected and was thrown back out after entering the egg\u2026\u201d\u201cIt turns out that all the purple qi I was using for cultivation is actually the inferior qi which this egg doesn\u2019t care about\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao was left speechless.\u201cI wonder when this egg will hatch\u2026\u201d After some imagination, Ye Xiao checked around the purple table carefully, expecting some other surprises to show up.It must have been his lucky day because yet another surprise dawned upon him.There was a small delicate purple box under the table. Inside this box, there were about a dozen round beady pills with the size of soybeans. They were all enveloped by a weak white halo of light.\u201cThis is Pei-Yuan Dan [1].\u201d Ye Xiao was knowledgeable and clear-sighted. How could he not know this stuff?However, Pei-Yuan Dan was nothing extraordinary in the Qing-Yun realm\u2026But these Pei-Yuan Dan were at a very high level \u2013 they could very well be of the highest quality. When they were made, there wasn\u2019t any efficacy lost due to it being restrained by spiritual energy. They had almost broken through the limit of dan!Anyway, Ye Xiao had never been able to produce something at such a high level in his prior life.However\u2026 even if it was of the highest level, it was still just Pei-Yuan Dan.The cheapest of the dans!\u201cAnd this is the only benefits I can get?\u201d Ye Xiao felt speechless as he put the Pei-Yuan Dan beads into a jade bottle and left the space with a loud sigh and a groan.\u201cThe qi I get is the discarded qi from that strange egg and the extra profit I get are actually some cheap dan beads. I really can\u2019t think of a word to say!\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cSteward, how much money do we have in the family? How much can I use?\u201d Ye Xiao asked the steward.\u201cUhh\u2026 Well\u2026\u201d The steward seemed to feel awkward, \u201cThe money in this family naturally all belongs to you my lord, but the salary of the general and the spoils of war are all for some certain uses. As for those left for you to use, they are\u2026 are all in your own closet.\u201dWhat he meant was obvious: For those given by the general, he could use them freely; those that wasn\u2019t given to him, he\u2019d better not plan on touching them.Ye Xiao stared, and then he sighed feebly.He knew about his father. General Ye was really an uncommonly/extremely nice boss to the soldiers. Most of his incomes were used to pension the relatives of the soldiers who had sacrificed themselves in battles, as well as those left disabled after wars\u2026This family really didn\u2019t have much money left for their own use\u2026Thanks to the departed Lord Ye Xiao, who had saved some gold and silver by acting recklessly. However, it was only about 500 gold bars [2]. Last time when he lent some to Zuo Wu Ji, it had taken him 250 gold bars already.He also took another 500 gold bars from Lan Lang-Lang by blackmailing him\u2026\u201cPoor! Truly poor!\u201d Ye Xiao was struggling.\u201cForget it. Go on with your own business. Just leave me alone.\u201d Ye Xiao waved his hand instructing the steward to move away.Ye Xiao collected his thoughts for a long time and eventually decided to change his appearance. For him, who used to be the world-renowned Xiao Monarch, it was child\u2019s play to change his appearance by transferring his spiritual power. Besides, now he was\u2026 an expert of the Grade of Diyuan.Although the Pei-Yuan Dan wasn\u2019t good stuff in Ye Xiao\u2019s eyes, it should still be considered one of a kind of tonics in this mortal world\u2026 So it would be better not to be found out that he was the one who released them to the public\u2026Otherwise, there would be endless troubles for him.A face with a dark and rough look, whiskers that seemed to have been growing for over 30 years and an extremely muscular body.That was exactly what Ye Xiao looked like after disguising himself. After checking himself out in the mirror over and over, he eventually nodded with satisfaction and then put on a bamboo hat as an extra form of insurance to keep his true identity hidden.\u201cThe Ling-Bao Hall Salesroom!\u201dYe Xiao was standing in front of the biggest salesroom in town. It was where tomorrow\u2019s auction was scheduled to be held. It was already bustling with people concerning themselves with decorating this salesroom in preparation for the auction that would take place the following day.What Zuo Wu-Ji wanted, would appear at this auction\u2026\u201cWell the name of the salesroom\u2026 is truly decent.\u201d Ye Xiao was looking at the busy staff and thinking deeply, murmured in his head, \u201cWasn\u2019t there a Heaven Attaining Salesroom in\u2026 I wonder if all these salesrooms are connected to each other, perhaps they\u2019re just branches?\u201dHe threw his thoughts aside for now and stepped through the door.\u201cPlease hold on, warrior.\u201d A man with a goatee from the salesroom came up to him and smiled fawningly, \u201cThe auction will not start till tomorrow\u2026\u201dIt was an obvious statement: Don\u2019t come before tomorrow.\u201cI come bringing business.\u201d With a raucous voice, Ye Xiao talked chillily, \u201cHow can I not know that the date for the auction is tomorrow? That is exactly why I am here today. Go fetch me your boss. Ask him if he wants some supreme dan on his auction. If you don\u2019t do this quickly, I will turn around and leave!\u201d\u201cSupreme dan?\u201d The man with the goatee frowned lightly.In the Land of Han-Yang, there would only be one in every one thousand people capable of making drugs. For a drug-maker to be able to reach such a level that he can create a dan, not even one in ten thousand drug-makers would reach such a level! As for dan, it was a wonderful thing that even an unfathomable cultivator couldn\u2019t easily obtain!Moreover, it was the supreme dan!But this guy\u2026\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me asking sir, the dan you are talking about\u2026 Could you show it to me?\u201d This goatee-beard man changed the term of address at once, from warrior to sir.Ye Xiao let out an annoyed grumble and without further ado shook the bottle in his hand, before taking its lid off.Suddenly, a dense wave of wonderful scent was released.The governor could only manage to get a measly sniff of it before Ye Xiao had decided to reseal the bottle. Even so, with just a sniff, the governor felt his entire body relax and a comfortable feeling entered his heart.\u201cPlease follow me. I will bring you to our most capable connoisseur immediately.\u201d Only with a sniff, the governor could judge: This supreme dan was very likely genuine!As the governor of the salesroom, he was naturally well informed, but today was still the first time that he got to appreciate this wonderful scent.All the ordinary tonics, even other valuable materials that were nearly upper-grade, were unable to be as precious as this!Ye Xiao sat on a fauteuil as if he was a warrior carrying a golden sword and riding a giant horse. He tasted the tea unhurriedly with a certain calm and confidence showing on his face.In front of him, the governor had returned in haste, \u201cSir, Master Guan from our salesroom is here. Master Guan is the number one connoisseur in our Heaven Attaining Salesroom! He\u2019ll definitely be able to tell, if the dans you\u2019re intending to sell are authentic or not.\u201dBehind him, there was a white-bearded old man radiating vigor.\u201cMay I have your noble name please?\u201d The white-bearded Master Guan smiled gently, \u201cAnd your title?\u201dYe Xiao smiled flatly, \u201cOld gentleman, are you considering\u2026 the possibility that there is a dan-maker in this kingdom? Or should we say\u2026 That there hasn\u2019t been a dan-maker of such a high level for many years in this kingdom??\u201dMaster Guan laughed, \u201cI didn\u2019t say that. There is always a smarter person and there is always a higher heaven. There is always what we cannot imagine, but nothing that can not be done\u2026 However, I have been staying here in the Chen-Xing City for 20 years. If you, sir, have actually brought some real dan\u2026 it would only be the third time that I would have the opportunity to auction dan in these 20 years! That is not only a great honor for the salesroom, but also for me!\u201dYe Xiao was deeply shocked by his words!He had still underestimated the value of dan in this mortal world!Although dan was something ordinary and common in the cultivation field, that was when it was in the Qing-Yun Realm!A dan with the efficacies of fortifying and nourishing the body was almost the same as rubbish in the Qing-Yun Realm. Who of all those elite cultivators in the Qing-Yun Realm would need such a thing? They wouldn\u2019t even have bothered to bend over and pick it from the ground!But in the mortal world, a dan like this was enough to be called the immortal dan!Only one portion could cure hundreds of illnesses!Only one portion could bring fitness!Only one portion could heal all wounds!Moreover, the Pei-Yuan Dan brought by Ye Xiao was actually the top-quality supreme dan!\u201cHere I congratulate you on having such great luck today. You can be sure that this is your third time to auction dan.\u201d Ye Xiao said flatly, \u201cBesides\u2026 If I can get a good deal this time, maybe you will\u2026 have the fourth and the fifth great honors like this one!\u201dMaster Guan trembled as he stroked his white beard and started to observe Ye Xiao. He carefully went over Ye Xiao\u2019s characteristics, his dark skin and the bamboo hat which he had worn despite being indoors, and then he said solemnly, \u201cI am Guan Wan-Shan. I dare ask how I should called your honor?\u201dYe Xiao smiled, \u201cI am\u2026 Feng Zhi-Ling.\u201d\u201cGreetings, brother Feng.\u201d Guan Wan-Shan nodded and smiled with a fist and palm salute. [3]Ye Xiao calmly nodded while retaining his previous posture. He would have never thought that the false name he had just now casually picked would turn out to become world-famous and universe-renowned\u2026 Many, many years later, it would become a legend in this world: The most honorable, the most handsome, the most unrestrained, the most elegant and the most magnanimous\u2026 The perfect-five [4] dan-maker in the world. (Eh-hem, let me play the role\u2026 I should be handsome and unrestrained somehow\u2026\u2014 words from the author)\u201cHowever, I should still see the dan first.\u201d Master Guan straightened his clothes and sat properly. His words might be mannerly, but what he meant was unavoidable.Ye Xiao wasn\u2019t surprised. He took out the jade bottle from his clothes and casually put it on the table.Guan Wan-Shan looked surprised. \u201cIf it is really supreme dan, how can he keep them in such an inferior bottle?\u201d He suddenly started to question the authenticity of these dan. But the next moment, when he took over the bottle and opened it, a dense stream of qi flowed out, which made Guan Wan-Shan\u2019s expression change instantly!His hands were shaking vigorously as he tried to seal the bottle very cautiously. It seemed as if he was afraid to let the scent flow away even just a little bit!Guan Wan-Shan took a deep breath to calm his fast beating heart down. When the dense scent had only barely reached his nostrils and he had felt the qi of life [5] which was the most potent qi he had ever seen in a dan, he realized\u2026As of now, even the thought of suspecting or disdaining the items taken out by this man in front of him had turned into a massive joke.This was the most valuable dan he had ever come across in his entire life!The very next moment he started giving a quick sequence of orders, \u201cSomebody, anybody, quick! Bring me my Purple Crystal Plate quick, and my Purple Jade Bottle\u2026 Bring me my Dan-Yang Mirror, hurry!. Quick quick quick\u2026\u201d Then he turned around and asked Ye Xiao in a straightforward manner, \u201cBrother Feng\u2026 The urh\u2026 How many pieces of this kind of high quality dan are you looking to sell? Just one? Or maybe two? Or\u2026\u201dHis voice was quivering. A 50, maybe 60 years old man, had his face reddened all over and his eyes filled with earnest eagerness and even a little craze.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu[1] Dan: One kind of medicine, mostly with miracle efficacy.

Finding such a valuable piece of dan was worth the good fortune of three generations, and he was actually hoping to see more. He really felt that greed had taken over his rationality. However, if he could obtain more than one of such a precious item, it would definitely be the best day of his life.The old man\u2019s reaction startled Ye Xiao but he still managed to reply indifferently, \u201cWell I didn\u2019t count how many are present. It should be about fifteen\u2026. maybe sixteen. Though, I truly didn\u2019t count\u2026\u201d He felt drops of sweat appear on his forehead as he started to worry, \u201cI truly don\u2019t think of this as something valuable. Why would it draw such a big reaction from this old man? This is such a hot headed old man!\u201d He was really taken aback by this kind of a reaction.\u201cWHAT?! F-fifteen\u2026 o-or sixteen?!? And you didn\u2019t even count it out?! Seriously?!\u201d Guan Wan-Shan stared at him like he wanted to hit Ye Xiao.Ye Xiao felt helpless as he innocently threw his hands up in the air..Guan Wan-Shan truly wanted to curse this man in front of him, but managed to keep his words to himself and thought, \u201cA single item is valuable enough to shake the world, yet he actually has more than fifteen of them. He has such ridiculous amounts of good luck to be able to acquire such valuable dan beads, yet he doesn\u2019t even seem to value it. He even takes it to an auction and yet, he couldn\u2019t even be bothered to do a simple count?!That was such a reckless waste of God\u2019s good gifts!This\u2026 This guy\u2026 was truly\u2026 a humongous black sheep!The three lords? They were simply three good kids compared to this guy!One could really not be compared with the other!\u201dGuan Wan-Shan\u2019s lips were trembling. He turned around and yelled, \u201c\u2026 G-go bring me twenty Purple Jade Bottles!\u201dHe couldn\u2019t scold Ye Xiao at the moment, so he vented his anger on his subordinates.Many loud shouts were heard one after the other, followed by footsteps which belonged to an approaching crowd.It had been at least a dozen years since they had seen the master connoisseur so agitated.By any chance, if they acted too slowly then they would be reprimanded at the least and in the worst case, even lose their jobs.Only a few moments later, Guan Wan-Shan had received all the equipment he had demanded.Then he took out a clean white towel and wiped his hands completely clean. He put a purple plate which was made out of crystal on the table after which, he took out a strange transparent cover and placed it over the plate.After that, he took the jade bottle from Ye Xiao and placed it on the plate through a strange opening in the cover.With that, only his hands could reach through the cover. They fit perfectly into the opening, making sure that none of the qi that was emanating from the dan bead would be able to escape.\u201cThis is some incredible equipment. It really is of great quality.\u201d The Xiao Monarch clicked his tongue in admiration for the structure of the cover.However, he didn\u2019t realize that his praise had made the old guy Guan nearly fall back down in anger. \u201cThe story about \u2018keeping the casket and giving back the pearl\u2019 [1] has become a laughingstock for over a thousand years. Now there is another living example. The cover is an artful thing but it can never even compare with the valuable dan beads. You think little of such treasure but admire a common cover. What a bloody world-class joke!\u201dWhen the jade bottle was opened, the wonderful scent spread again. Moreover, from the bottle, a mass of white mist emerged, which was much too dense to disperse.\u201cDan\u2026 cloud!!!\u201dThe white beard of Guan Wan-Shan was quivering. His eyes nearly popped out of their sockets and dropped to the ground.There are nine grades of dan and only those over grade 7 release a dan mist. At the highest grade 9, this dan mist would even contain visible dan veins.However, only the legendary, limit breaking dan that had broken through the limits of the ninth grade could produce\u2026 the legendary dan cloud!Note: The appearance of the dan cloud is, however, not a certainty! That is to say\u2026 even those legendary dan beads might only have a layer of \u2018dan mist\u2019, rather than a full dan cloud.The cloud and the mist actually share the same essential attributes, but the mist would quickly disperse while, according to the legends, the cloud would keep on rising while continuously changing its shape!That is similar to the difference between heaven and earth!The dan cloud was something that only appeared in those legendary stories from eons past. Only stories were told about it in this mortal world, but it had never been seen before!At this moment, Guan Wan-Shan was witnessing the legendary dan cloud that he hadn\u2019t even dared dreaming about, and was feeling its extremely dense scent, which brought the greatest joy to both his body and mind. He was nearly crying out in excitement.\u201cMy dear ancestors!\u201d Guan Wan-Shan thrillingly murmured, \u201cToday, I\u2026I have finally seen the legendary dan cloud with my own two eyes! Oh this dan cloud\u2026 It is worth three-generation good fortune\u2026 I no longer have regrets and I can die willingly\u2026\u201dThe Xiao Monarch was slightly stunned, \u201cWhat the hell is going on? He is just identifying some dan beads. How could such a simple thing make him go crazy\u2026 Die willingly he says\u2026 That is just a simple dan bead, not some lethal incurable poison!\u201dThe bottle was carefully being leaned forward letting a soybean-sized dan bead roll out. The soybean-sized dan bead was still enveloped by the dan cloud as it was rolling around on the plate. After a while the dan bead could be clearly identified as a golden dan bead with mysterious veins covering its entire surface\u2026Guan Wan-Shan lightly closed his satisfaction filled eyes.No further inspection was needed.Veins were densely covering this dan bead, while the dan cloud was still ever spreadingThis was \u2014 something that could only be produced by the supreme immortals from myths \u2014 the legendary magical grade 10 dan!Although it was just some Pei-Yuan Dan, with such quality, even the grade 9 dan-maker that only existed in the myth would want to buy it for a price and take it for research, because\u2026 more than just about the grade of dan, it was about opening an entrance to a tough path towards supreme dan-making!Even learning a tiny bit of the technique could bring a big upgrade to the dan-maker.Almost acting like a devotional fanatic, Guan Wan-Shan quickly grabbed a purple jade bottle and put the first Pei-Yuan Dan bead into it. Followed by the second Pei-Yuan Dan bead entering a second bottle, the third one in another bottle\u2026 and then the fourth\u2026\u201cFifteen in total!\u201dGuan Wan-Shan was utterly shocked by the number.Although Ye Xiao had mentioned it, Guan Wan-Shan still had a hard time believing this man in front of him, especially after he had confirmed the quality of the dan beads that even released the legendary dan cloud. It could be said that to even create one of these at a time in a sealed furnace would be a matter of unbelievable luck. But, it was obvious to him that the fifteen were produced from the same furnace at the same time, and they actually all had the same legendary quality!\u201cThis\u2026 Brother Feng!\u201d Guan Wan-Shan turned around, looked at Ye Xiao like a ravenous wolf and said eagerly, \u201cBrother Feng, these dan beads were so outstanding. Make a price! These dan beads, no matter what price you make, we will take them!\u201d\u201cMaster Guan\u2026\u201dThe governor standing beside them was greatly startled.\u201cWTF! He must have gone crazy\u2026\u201d He thought.Normally, as the connoisseur of the salesroom, even if he had confirmed the facticity of the dan beads, at least he should have depreciated it, declined it a little and then taken it with feigned difficulty. This was his known tactic to greatly lower the price required to acquire new items for the auction.However, now that he had said this\u2026 it was so far beyond outstanding that they would take it regardless of the astronomical costs.If Ye Xiao made a sky-high price\u2026What was he supposed to do about it?!\u201cHeh heh, these dan beads, I\u2019m not interested in selling them.\u201d Ye Xiao glanced at the governor with a mocking smile, \u201cMaster Guan, you really do have some exceptional capabilities. With such spirit, heh heh, you must have achieved great heights.\u201dGuan Wan-Shan understood the hint and hurriedly turned around and shouted, \u201cGet out! Not even a single word about today should leak out! If there is any information that leaks outside, you can forget about your puny life!\u201dThe governor quickly gave Master Guan his word, before quickly making his way out, wiping large beads of sweat off of his forehead.He might not know anything about the grades of dan, but even he had realised the seriousness of this situation.Guan Wan-Shan turned to Ye Xiao and said with an embarrassed smile, \u201cSorry. My underlings are underbred. They don\u2019t understand the rareness of these legendary dan beads\u2026 Please forgive them with your lenience.\u201dYe Xiao nodded lightly.Guan Wan-Shan clearly knew the meaning behind Ye Xiao\u2019s words: If he tried to force down the price of such supreme dan beads like he dealt with some ordinary thing\u2026 then, Ye Xiao might feel sullen and just leave, leaving him empty handed losing this three-generations worth of good fortune.An opportunity like this one\u2026 Over ten generations of his family had done auction appreciating, yet it wasn\u2019t until now that such a valuable item had appeared in their auction house!Besides, if he were to lie about his opinion, he would feel like he was desecrating the legendary dan beads this man had brought; for such high-quality dan beads, even if he had intentionally tried to force down the price, he would have very likely offended all the dan-makers in the world at the same time!Once it spread out that he had done such a vile thing, his reputation would be ruined \u2013 people might say, \u201cYou had actually dared to force down the price of the legendary dan beads that even produced an actual dan cloud?! Then what about those ordinary dan beads which were in your possession? Would you expect to be given money for taking those?!\u201d\u201cBrother Feng, you just said that you don\u2019t want to sell\u2026 What do you mean? What plan do you have? Please, could you say it out, please!\u201d Guan Wan-Shan asked humbly, and then immediately called for tea, \u201cThe good one. The best tea\u2026\u201d\u201cMy plan is simple. I just want some treasures in exchange for these dan beads.\u201d Ye Xiao said honestly, \u201cAnd you must have realized that I haven\u2019t produced these dan beads myself. The production of these dan beads is far beyond my capabilities.\u201dGuan Wan-Shan looked at him as thoughts quickly rushed through his head, \u201cHmm, he doesn\u2019t have any traces of firing on his hands, any traces of gentle and mass roasting on his face or the unique smell of a dan-maker on his body\u2026\u201d He nodded and nearly said something offensive, \u201cI dare you to\u2026 Eh-hem\u2026 Brother Feng you are being humble\u2026\u201dInstantly, he felt his face starting to burn and a dark red color quickly spread on his face. He had somehow managed to hold the second part of his sentence in his mouth, however, the half that he had already spoken out had such a clear meaning that even a fool could guess where it was going.Ye Xiao humphed, \u201cIt isn\u2019t me who produced these dan beads\u2026 but, the dan-maker who was able to create such dan beads is unwilling to show up, let alone to be in contact with ordinary people in this mortal world\u2026\u201dWhat he meant was that master Guan could do all he wanted, he was simply not worthy to meet this legendary dan-maker.Guan Wan-Shan didn\u2019t doubt these words at all; instead he comprehended tacitly and took it for granted, so he showed a humbler attitude, \u201cYes\u2026 Yes. Yes. Such an expert must absolutely be absorbed in his dan-making cultivation. He will never have some spare time on hand to get in touch with us mortal people. Brother Feng what you say is very reasonable\u2026\u201d\u201cWhenever we could get the favor from an honorable dan-making master, we would accept any proposal from him or her, no matter what was proposed. However, to exchange dan beads for treasures\u2026 This salesroom truly has never had such a case in our long history\u2026\u201d Guan Wan-Shan said, \u201cBrother Feng, I am sure that you\u2019re aware of the laws concerning trade in our Land of Han Yang. Everything has to be valuated with gold or silver and in every trade, the salesroom must give the government a fixed\u2026 expense as tax. It is not that I don\u2019t want to make this deal, but\u2026\u201dYe Xiao nodded. He understood.If they used treasures for exchange, how could the government take a percentage of the deal? What would the tax be in a scenario like this? Would it be equal to the value of a golden leave perhaps?Salesrooms were strictly overseen by the government, so they wouldn\u2019t dare to make such deals.Once they did, they would lose their qualifications and, moreover, get prosecuted.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euEven though Guan Wan-Shan knew he would offend this legendary dan-maker and even though he wanted to do anything to make this deal work, under such circumstance, he had to think of those relying on him and turn this offer down!Ye Xiao muttered, \u201cI understand your concern and difficulty\u2026 but, the senior dan-maker is eccentric. Gold and silver, he turns his nose up at them. If I go and tell him about your difficulty, the deal will certainly be canceled. I am afraid you will not be happy to see that happen!\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014[1] Keeping the casket and giving back the pearl: A Chinese idiom. It is an analogy meaning a lack of judgment and making the wrong decisions. It also refers to people who attach more importance to the appearance than the inner beauty or the quality.*A jewelry dealer put his pearls in small caskets so as to make them look precious. The caskets were made of precious wood and luxuriously decorated with perfume and gemstones. A person was very fond of these exquisite and beautiful caskets and bought one. After paying the money, he opened the casket, took the pearl out and gave it back to the dealer. He then left with just the casket.*Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Of course I know that it is a great honor to be given this proposition by the master dan-maker\u2026 Hmm, look, can we figure out something\u2026 to do it diversified and indirectly. What do you think?\u201dYe Xiao frowned, \u201cHow diversified? How indirectly?\u201d\u201cThe diversified and indirect way is actually not that complicated. We can pay you some money for the dan beads first, and then you use the money to attend the auction or just purchase the treasures\u2026 Isn\u2019t this an easy way for both of us to achieve our goals?\u201dYe Xiao squinted at him and replied significantly, \u201cWhat if we fail to get the treasures in the auction?\u201dGuan Wan-Shan smiled bitterly, \u201cBrother Feng, it seems you are well aware of the auctions\u2026 Alas, it is not all that easy these days. However, the treasures may be held on to tightly by different groups and the government has announced that some of them should be handed in, but since we can stand mighty in the capital, we surely have our secretive means\u2026 Otherwise, how can such a great amount of treasures from all over the world be gathered together?\u201dSaying those words, Guan Wan-Shan gave an impression of being proud.Ye Xiao was slightly shocked and answered, \u201cSince you say so, I can only trust you. But you know clearly about the quality of these dan beads from the master dan-maker and their value. Are there really that many treasures present over here? Besides, even if you manage to take out enough treasures this time; what about next time; or even the third time? I don\u2019t think you want this deal to be one-off, right?!\u201dAll the while he was continuously racking his brains, \u201cHow many objects in total could there be regarded as treasures in this world? Could this salesroom actually possess such resources?\u201d\u201cI think that perhaps your opinion is slightly inaccurate. Stalactite and Starlight are of course treasures. Well, then ginseng and ganoderma [1]\u2026 are also treasures, aren\u2019t they? Guan Wan-Shan said with confidence.\u201cUrh\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao couldn\u2019t help but to stare speechlessly at this old man.If some 10-year old ginseng could be considered a treasure\u2026 then the treasures in this world would be really uncountable\u2026However, Ye Xiao didn\u2019t expect getting a lot of top-level treasures all at once, just the more the better, and so, he agreed with Guan Wan-Shan, \u201cWhat you are saying is reasonable. As for these dan beads\u2026 What price can you make for them?\u201dGuan Wan-Shan smiled bitterly and said after muttering for a while, \u201cFor some ordinary Pei-Yuan Dan beads, we usually spend no more than 25 hundred silver bars for each\u2026 and then we sell them on the auctions. Anyway, although the dan beads you bring are also simple Pei-Yuan Dan, it has the sky-top quality! Of course they couldn\u2019t be mentioned in the same breath, so\u2026 Look, 25 thousand bars, for each, what do you think?\u201d\u201cAre these dan beads really that valuable?!\u201d Ye Xiao was shocked and shouted out in his mind.But his face only showed a serious frown, and answered with an unassailable tone, \u201c100 thousand silver bars, each!\u201dDifficulty was clearly shown on Guan Wan-Shan\u2019s face, \u201cBrother Feng, for these Pei-Yuan Dan beads that were produced by your master dan-maker, which has reached the legendary grade 10, it is indeed worthy of 100 thousand silver bars. As a matter of fact, it could very well be even worth more\u2026 But, because these dan beads are really so precious, we will not sell them at the auction; instead, we will keep them\u2026 Heh heh, in our present financial situation, 1500 thousand silver bars\u2026 is quite beyond our budget\u2026\u201dYe Xiao was impervious, \u201cLack of money? Well then you could buy less. Just take five of them. As for the other ten, you can sell them at the auction for me. No matter how much they are sold for, it all belongs to me.\u201dGuan Wan-Shan was stunned,\u201cThis guy really has a rigorous way of doing things.\u201dIn customary cases of auctions, if one thing was not unique and even had over ten identical pieces, the final bid price would be reduced badly. After all when there were many identical treasures, the relation between demand and supply changed. For instance, an upper-level dan bead may be sold for a sky-high price, but if there were ten identical upper-level dan bead at the same time, no matter how precious they were, the price would decrease badly for sure.What Ye Xiao suggested \u2014 one for 100 thousand silver bars and fifteen for 1500 thousand silver bars was totally inconsistent with the trade principle in auctions!However, there were always exceptions; the supreme dan beads Ye Xiao had brought, was actually such an exception. Pei-Yuan Dan with sky-high quality had reached the limit of dan-making in the world. Even if there were more than 15 pieces, the price would never decrease even a bit \u2014 it would get higher instead!If the dan beads were truly on sale at the auction, the price would definitely go higher than 100 thousand silver bars. If Guan Wan-Shan wanted to buy them after the auction, it would be simply impossible with a budget of a mere 100 thousand bars of silver per dan bead. It was his luck that he could get five in advance now!\u201cFine, that\u2019s it then.\u201d Guan Wan-Shan gnashed and promised.He knew clearly whoever could take out these supreme dan beads was no ordinary person. He believed that as long as this guy was satisfied, there would be more opportunities like this in the future.But if he wasn\u2019t satisfied, he wouldn\u2019t get another opportunity.When Ye Xiao walked into the salesroom, he only had a few grams of silver on him. Yet when he left the salesroom, he got a note for 500 thousand silver bars!He had become a multimillionaire by simply walking in, dumping some \u2018low quality\u2019 dan beads, and leaving the building!Guan Wan-Shan had amiably offered him a Skyline VIP Card, yet he had rejected it without hesitation.\u201cI will come back here for more business, however, I do not wish to be tied down here by such a simple card. Do I require a card to prove my status aroundhere?\u201dLooking at Ye Xiao\u2019s back, Guan Wan-Shan looked grave.\u201c\u2026 \u2018don\u2019t want to be tied up\u2019\u2026 He really doesn\u2019t want it?!\u201d Guan Wan-Shan was shocked.\u201cHe really is a smart guy.\u201d As a sharp-sighted man, how could he not realise what Ye Xiao had truly meant?He didn\u2019t want a VIP plate, because he was a freewheeling and unfettered man.A VIP card might be a symbol of one\u2019s status and showed his value, but it was also a binding \u2014 once Ye Xiao got a card like this, the next time he wished to attend a salesroom, he\u2019d be obligated to come back to this salesroom.That was an invisible constraint.Apparently Ye Xiao didn\u2019t like that.From within the shadows a figure suddenly quietly approached Master Guan, \u201cMaster, do we need to tail this guy?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Guan Wan-Shan showed a serious face, \u201cThis guy\u2026 he is absolutely someone we can not mess around with. If we displease him, even if we kill him, we will lose the connection with the supreme dan-maker and face serious retributions\u2026 Inform the head office first and we\u2019ll deal with him later.\u201d\u201cYes, master\u2026 Well, about the auction\u2026\u201d\u201cDelay!\u201d Guan Wan-Shan waved his hand and replied firmly, \u201cThere were a few herbs that were enough to be the main selling points. But now, compared to these supreme dan beads, they are far from enough. Make an announcement now. The auction will be delayed by ten days. Inform the head office about these supreme dan beads and ask them for a plan. We will follow their lead.\u201d\u201cYes, master.\u201dYe Xiao had left the salesroom and made his way through a couple of back alleys before he returned to one of the larger streets. He had regained the appearance of a young handsome lord. His appearance, demeanor, stature and temperament\u2026 were all changed.The tall, strong and ugly Feng Zhi-Ling was gone.\u201cThe auction is tomorrow\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao was thinking, \u201cWith these 500 thousand silver bars, I can at least buy some treasures, right? Besides, I saw the jade ruyi\u2026 I need to make sure Zuo Wu-Ji gets it. Otherwise if he retracts the deal\u2026\u201dYe Xiao was expecting the auction to proceed smoothly, but he was unaware of the actions of master Guan who had delayed the auction.And he, who wanted the auction to be smooth the most, was actually the main culprit for the delay\u2026Nothing happened on his way home. Ye Xiao practiced some martial arts after he got home, before he started reading. After all, he had understood this mortal world through the memories of the departed Ye Xiao but they were imperfect. It would be better for him to read more about this mortal world, so he would have an easier time settling in.When the night was about to come, the guard appeared in front of Ye Xiao and informed him, \u201cLord Lan and Lord Zuo have come together. They are here to meet you, my lord.\u201d\u201cWhy did they come together?\u201d Ye Xiao was surprised.\u201cFxxk! Fxxk fxxk fxxk\u2026\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji hadn\u2019t entered the room yet, but his shouts were already clearly resounding inside the mansion.Lan Lang-Lang\u2019s voice also came with a depressed tone, \u201cThe Ling-Bao Salesroom is playing us apparently\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat happened? Why are you both so angry?\u201d Ye Xiao looked at both of them while frowning with confusion.\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it!\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji sighed deeply, and then sat on the chair, \u201cThe bloody auction is delayed! Fxxk\u2026\u201dFor Zuo Wu-Ji, who wished for nothing more than to restore his reputation in his family by regaining the possession of a jade ruyi, every minute felt like a year!He had finally gotten his hand on enough money to buy the jade ruyi and all he had to do was bid on the jade ruyi at the auction\u2026 But the auction had actually been delayed!When he heard about the delay, he had nearly spit out blood, because the miserable life he was living recently had to continue for at least another ten days!\u201cI don\u2019t want to live anymore\u2026 I can\u2019t live with it anymore\u2026\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji was crying without shedding any tears.\u201cDelay? Why is it delayed?\u201d Ye Xiao opened his eye wide.It was no good news for him either. The sooner the auction was held, the earlier he\u2019d get some treasures. Which in turn could let him learn more about the sphere in his mind and the space within it and cultivate to a higher realm sooner.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThere is a goddamn moron!\u201d Lan Lang-Lang sighed, \u201cAt this important moment, he actually took out a few supreme dan beads\u2026 With such precious items, how could the salesroom not delay the auction to make advertisements for the beads? Several days are absolutely not enough to advertise it! Ten days is actually rushed, if we think of the situation\u2026 Gosh, what a shame. I have heard that a cool-steel sword is on sale at the auction. I was planning to get it as soon as possible. Now I need to wait for another ten days. Fxxk that bloody moron\u2026\u201d\u201cUrh\u2026Just because of some supreme dan beads\u2026 It is delayed?\u201d Ye Xiao was slack-jawed.Isn\u2019t it like lifting a stone to drop it on one\u2019s own foot?_________________[1] Ganoderma: A genus of polypore mushrooms that grow on wood, and they include about 80 species, many from tropical regions.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Let\u2019s Go Make Some Trouble!The reason why Ye Xiao tried to earn some money quickly was so that he could buy some treasures at the auction to feed the spiritual space. He had successfully obtained the money, but now the auction was delayed\u2026.Ten days was not a very long time, but the problem was that, Ye Xiao couldn\u2019t wait any longer. Not even one more day!\u201cBy the way, how is the robbery case\u2026 you know, of your house?\u201d Ye Xiao was feeling depressed so he changed the topic to ask about what he was interested in most at the moment.Zuo Wu-Ji\u2019s grandfather Mr Zuo, the father of the minister, had searched in every nook and cranny of the capital, Chen-Xing City, several times. Now the whole city had a dense mist of nervousness hanging over it and now, even the most insignificant of sounds could instill the greatest of fears in the hearts of the residents. The public security had even become unprecedentedly tight \u2013 thanks to Zuo Wu-Ji\u2019s grandfather.\u201cSkip it!\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji looked pale, \u201cThat night I was nearly killed. My grandfather came back home and found that most of his collection had been stolen which had made him furious! These days there is no one in the house that dares to speak out loud\u2026\u201dYe Xiao said modestly, \u201cIt seems that your grandfather must have lost something extremely valuable in that robbery\u2026\u201d\u201cApparently so\u2026\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji sighed, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen my grandpa this angry since I was a baby\u2026 Now the whole city has been thrown upside down because of my family and yet my grandpa still isn\u2019t willing to let it go\u2026\u201dYe Xiao replied with an \u2018oh\u2019 before asking thoughtfully, \u201cWell then, did your grandpa specify which was the most valuable piece amongst the stolen treasures?\u201d\u201cWho would dare to ask him in his current condition?\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji shouted, feeling wronged, \u201cAt the time I had only said one word, but I got immediately beaten several times\u2026\u201dLan Lang-Lang showed deep interests, \u201cWhat exactly did you say?\u201d\u201cNothing special\u2026 I just said \u2018be off with the old and move on with the new. Don\u2019t worry grandpa\u2019 \u2026\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji felt like weeping but was lacking tears, \u201cThen he had suddenly entered a frenzy and shouted, \u2018You damn black sheep! It is this damn attitude of yours with which you steal every valuable thing in this house and exchange them for prostitutes and alcohol\u2019 \u2026 then he gave me a beating!\u201dZuo Wu-Ji spoke sadly, \u201cTell me, what have I done wrong? I said those words only to comfort him, and yet I got mercilessly beaten. Did I really doom myself to a thrashing?\u201d\u201cEh-hem, hemm\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao started to cough loudly in an attempt to conceal the laughter that was boiling up inside of him.\u201cArhahahahah..whooppahaha\u2026\u201d Lan Lang-Lang didn\u2019t even try to cover up his laughter; instead he laughed gloatingly.Lan Lang-Lang and Zuo Wu-Ji had become extremely bored due to the auction being delayed, so they had come over to see Ye Xiao. Zuo Wu-Ji had always been hostile towards Ye Xiao \u2013 they disliked each other. However, this had all changed after the \u2018great favor\u2019 from Ye Xiao. He had even started to consider Ye Xiao to be a true friend, and so, he had come over to Ye Xiao with Lan Lang-Lang to complain about the auction and their boredom and perhaps to score a free meal from Ye Xiao.Ye Xiao smiled and looked through the window at the dark night sky as he lightly said, \u201cThe robbery\u2026 maybe it wasn\u2019t such a bad thing for your clan\u2026 There is an old saying which says that luck and misfortune come in turns\u2026 Maybe, for the loss you have suffered today it will be repaid a thousand times in the future\u2026\u201dYe Xiao spoke very slowly. It seemed like what he was saying had some obscure meanings.Zuo Wu-Ji sighed. He didn\u2019t know what Ye Xiao had really meant. He didn\u2019t understand that it was actually a precious promise. He could only feel bad about his own misery at the moment, \u201cAlas, don\u2019t talk about making it up\u2026Right now I become scared enough to piss every time I see my grandpa \u2026 I\u2019d better fix my own issues first. The bloody auction, how could they fxxking delay it? The bloody moron with his supreme dan beads. If I get a chance to meet him\u2026 I promise, I will tear him into a million shreds\u2026\u201dHe let out another sigh which was filled with endless sadness.\u201cOh I see why you two have come here. The auction is delayed and you guys are slowly dying due to boredom, right? So you are here to seek some amusement from me, right?\u201d Ye Xiao looked at them with amusement.The delay of the auction had been troubling him as well, even more so, after finding out that he had become the reason for this delay.Besides\u2026 Lan Lang-Lang and Zuo Wu-Ji could complain about it out loud while he couldn\u2019t say a word about it!And they were even calling him a moron right to his face. He really felt like giving these two in front of him an asswhooping. Though he found it extremely painful to tolerate their trash talking, he still had to!\u201cHeh heh heh\u2026 Oh right, I know of a freakish occurrence which might interest you, brother Ye. Do you remember the Shan-Hua House?\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji asked.\u201cHmm?\u201d Ye Xiao\u2019s eyes turned cold with chilliness emanating from them.How could he forget the place where he \u2013 or should we say the departed Ye Xiao \u2013 got poisoned: the brothel Shan-Hua House.\u201cNinety-eight people in Shan-Hua House were all killed. Everyone in that house is dead, no survivors.\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji sighed regretfully, \u201cI was going to have some fun there during this rough time, you know, with those pretty chicks. When I got there, all I saw were rotting corpses. That was really disappointing\u2026 It is a pity about those pretty gals\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat? All dead?\u201d Ye Xiao frowned tightly.\u201cAll dead.\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji nodded, \u201cAnd\u2026 according to the signs on their bodies, they must have died several days ago. The government are terribly distracted because of the robbery, to even miss so many dead bodies.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Ye Xiao felt relieved and thought, \u201cThey\u2019ve been dead for several days, so the murder has nothing to do with the robbery. It seems that\u2026 right after I was poisoned when I was struggling to survive, these people in Shan-Hua House had already been killed. Everyone in that brothel had been taken care of, eliminating any possible clue!\u201dThe man who planned this murder is truly wicked and merciless!\u201cZuo Wu-Ji, do you know the identity of Shan-Hua House\u2019s owner?\u201d Ye Xiao probed, \u201cThe whole house was wiped out and still the owner had not yet shown up?\u201dZuo Wu-Ji scratched his head and said, \u201cWell this is a tough question for me. I am not so sure to be honest\u2026 However, it is said that the house is related to Wan Xiao-nian, but\u2026 there is no basis for these claims.\u201d\u201cWang Xiao-Nian?\u201d Ye Xiao said with half-closed eyes, \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 The son of Wang Da-Nian, the personal guard of the crown prince, the leader of the guards in the Crown Prince\u2019s Palace, right?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s him.\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji smiled, \u201cThis bastard Wang Xiao-Nian was boasting a few days ago that his father had received a hundreds-years old top-quality blood ginseng, which was to be used to improve his strength. It is said that that ginseng can make a man reach the upper-level cultivation and become an expert cultivator in just one night\u2026 Fxxk that! The bastard is really boasting. I hate every bit of him! Well, at the end of the day, the murders at the brothel have nothing to do with us. We just lost a nice place to enjoy ourselves\u2026\u201d\u201cEnjoy? Is your disease cured?\u201d He looked at Zuo Wu-Ji sportively. The \u2018hundreds-years old quality blood ginseng\u2019 had lit up Ye Xiao\u2019s eyes.Zuo Wu-Ji turned red-faced and shouted, \u201cYe Xiao! Don\u2019t force me to fight against you!\u201d He had forgotten what he had said about the blood ginseng instantly.Lan Lang-Lang almost split his sides due to laughing vigorously and caused his hat to nearly fall off his favus infested head . He grinned, \u201cOh can\u2019t we say the truth about you any more? You went to the brothel time to time and how many times did you fxxk a girl? Is there any time you are not the one being fxxked? hahahaha\u2026. There are six prostitutes sworn brother and sister with you, and I heard that you are the youngest? Lord Zuo, you are actually very well-known as the famous Gal No.7\u2026\u201d\u201cFxxking bastard!\u201d Hearing the word \u2018Gal No.7\u2019, Zuo Wu-Ji turned into a raging beast. He rushed forward to hold Lan Lang-Lang and gave him punches and kicks, while Lan Lang-Lang was laughing and got into a clinch with him.As a matter of fact, though Zuo Wu-Ji had a foppish personality, he had an inborn disease, which was unspeakable. Eh-hem. Well\u2026 he couldn\u2019t do that thing \u2013 you know. Normally it was something a man would never tell, but the foppish and prodigal lord Zuo was liberal to face such defect. It was really something strange\u2026After the horseplay, Zuo Wu-Ji felt sad and sighed, \u201cThe auction is delayed, but I heard that these supreme dan beads are something better than the best, with quality higher than the highest\u2026 If only I could get my hand on one of them during the auction\u2026:\u201dLan Lang-Lang showed disdain, \u201cCome on, dear lord Zuo. Forget about that, will you? With our wealth, we can just afford one for sure, but\u2026 the question is there is no way we have the chance to win the bid. Those noble-blooded guys will fight until bleeding their fists.\u201dZuo Wu-Ji nodded and sighed.The three of them were called \u2018the three lords in town\u2019 like they had a splendid title, however, compared with those lads truly born with noble blood, they couldn\u2019t even be mentioned in the same sentence.The noble clans were able to function alongside each other peacefully, because they made sure not to touch each other\u2019s businesses.But they disliked each other for sure.Among the three clans, the clan of Zuo was somehow stronger than the other two \u2013 the clan of Lan and the clan of Ye. Zuo Wu-Ji had elder brothers and he was substantially given up by the clan because of his disease. Ye Xiao was the only son of the Ye clan, while Lan Lang-Lang was also the only son of the Lan clan\u2026\u201cThe real noble clans\u2026\u201d Lan Lang-Lang sighed.\u201cWhile the royal court has existed for a hundred years, the clans have existed for thousands upon thousands of years\u2026\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji smiled, \u201cOur clans are far from those noble clans. To be able to compare ourselves with the true noble clans, we will need to prosper for at least another century\u2026\u201d He shook his head helplessly.\u201cWhat noble clan has a foppish black sheep like you?\u201d Lan Lang-Lang disdainfully said.\u201cOh, so you think you are better than me?\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji glared at him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIt looked like the very next moment would be the start of a fight.Ye Xiao felt an agitation, he had never felt before, awaken deep down within his bones.\u201cStop! Shut up both of you. This is my house ok? Get somewhere else to fight\u2026 Hmm, well if you are really that bored, why don\u2019t we go make some trouble for Wang Xiao-Nian?\u201d Ye Xiao smiled and thought, \u201cThe blood ginseng shouldn\u2019t be wasted in some mortal\u2019s hand right? I wouldn\u2019t think anything of it if I don\u2019t know about it, but I do know now. So I shall not let such thing escape my hands\u2026\u201dWang Xiao-Nian was somehow related to the poison after all\u2026\u201cSure!\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji and Lan Lang-Lang were both meddlers. They both raised their hands and got excited when hearing the suggestion.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But none of them were brave enough to make careless moves, for all of them were truly scared of being annihilated.The forces of Zuo Xiang Fu had blocked the four gates of the city and had searched the most crime infested areas within the city. They began to act out against the gangs while shouting out a phony slogan: Fight against the criminals; bring back the peace!They made detailed investigations against each and every gang.Those who used to play the bullies on the street were now forced to face the music.A big suspicion crept into every resident\u2019s mind:Just what on earth was stolen from the house of the Minister Zuo? Several days have passed and they are actually still continuing with the investigation!At the same time, news of two other great events was quickly spreading throughout the kingdom of Chen!The first was about the killer group Tu-Tian Group, which was feared as the most mysterious and deadliest group. They suddenly suffered a surprise raid causing many of their top killers to be eliminated.Their secret hideout, on which their existence depended on, was no longer a mystery. Once a killer exposed both his name and face to the public, he would become the public enemy number one. Nobody knew the identity of the person who spilled the secrets of the Tu Tian Group to the world.Now that it was known where the Tu Tian Group could be found, all people with prior grudges set out to take this group out.They were like rats crossing the street!The head of Tu-Tian Group \u2013 the No. 1 mysterious killer in the world, Ning Bi-Luo, had luckily fought his way out of the siege and left his stronghold. He had completely vanished from the face of the earth.The second was\u2026 of course, about the emergence of the supreme dan beads!The Ling-Bao Hall Salesroom was gonna sell the supreme dan at the next auction which was about to take place!Pei-Yuan Dan was absolutely nothing of high value for the martial sects in this world. It was useful to a certain degree, but only at the starting stages of cultivation. Once a person had become an expert cultivator, Pei-Yuan Dan beads would become practically useless to him!However, conventional logic could not be applied in the case of these Pei-Yuan Dan beads! Although it was the lowest-grade dan, once it produced the dan cloud, it was definitely something from legends!These legendary dan beads were something that all dan makers in the world would covet!If a dan-maker could study it, it could at least boost his dan-making skills into a higher grade!And dan-making was actually the basic foundation of every martial sect! Every sect wants to strengthen their foundations.Therefore all the martial sects made their decisions at once: to send their finest men to the capital. They gave such orders without any hesitation: to try their best to acquire the supreme dan no matter what cost!To ensure that they were not duped, every martial sect had sent an experienced dan-maker!They didn\u2019t know how many of these legendary dan beads were going to be auctioned. What if there was just one\uff1fSupreme dan with dan cloud was always something from the legends. How would these martial sects dare expect there could be more than one? So when they heard about the good news, they were all thrilled but also filled with caution. Every martial sect spared no effort to fight for it!While Zuo Xiang Fu was still \u2018hunting for the criminals\u2019 all over the capital, all the mysterious martial sects and noble clans started showing up. The whole capital was quickly turning extremely chaotic!Every force in the world had the same target: Chen-Xing City, the capital of the Chen Kingdom!Qing-Yun Sect, Cang-Shan Sect, Ling-Yun Sect, Zi-Yu Sect, An-Ning Sect, Wu-Liang Sect\u2026One could go on for hours!All these superior martial sects started making preparations in advance for this once in a lifetime auction. Even those long-white-bearded old elders who hadn\u2019t shown their faces for many years were slowly reappearing.Ye Xiao could never have imagined that on the day when he casually used some movements and was mistaken for Ning Bi-Luo, he had actually caused the destruction to a top assassins guild in the Kingdom of Chen.And he could never have imagined that just by revealing some dan beads, he had caused a massive sensation in the mortal world. He was simply trying to earn some money and get some high quality treasures so that he could go faster in his road of cultivation. If he had known that the beads would receive such worldwide attention, he would have done something low-pitched instead\u2026In his previous life, he had grown up in the higher-level world of Qing-Yun Realm and had never visited the mortal world, and so, he wouldn\u2019t have guessed that even the cheapest dan could actually cause such a large scale disturbance!He had been lacking the funds to achieve his goals, so he had casually taken out the supreme dan beads to deal with this issue.He had accidentally caused tidal waves of trouble to wash over these lands. He had, however, no clue about all these events currently taking place all around the Kingdom of Chen, as he was leisurely enjoying himself in the capital\u2026\u2026\u2026At this moment Ye Xiao was in Wang Xiao-Nian\u2019s house looking to create some trouble.Wang Xiao-Nian felt the pressure emitted by these three foppish lords pressing him down, making it hard for him to breath or even to stand up straight. They were creating trouble for him and the young lord Wang couldn\u2019t handle it, so he had secretly sent for his father.\u201cWang Xiao-Nian, be honest! That night in Shan-Hua House, was it you who poisoned me?\u201d Ye Xiao stared at Wang Xiao-Nian fiercely.\u201cYes! It was you who poisoned Ye Xiao! I am the witness!\u201d Lan Lang-Lang always desired to stir up trouble, so when he heard Ye Xiao\u2019s \u2018powerful\u2019 pretext, he jumped right in. He didn\u2019t care if it was true or not, he just wanted to make some trouble here\u2026\u201cYou bastard actually dared to poison my brother. How dare you!\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji shouted cheerfully.In the two foppish lads\u2019 minds, getting poisoned was absolutely something made up by Ye Xiao. They wouldn\u2019t have known that it was the truth. Anyway, they just wanted to add fuel to the fire and at least make Wang Xiao-Nian sweat.Ye Xiao was also showing a face like he was just setting him up with some fake excuses. It became harder for Wang Xiao-Nian to tell right from left as what was true started to seem false and what was false started to seem like the truth.Wang Xiao-Nian\u2019s face turned pale, \u201cYe Xiao\u2026 you\u2026you\u2026 Don\u2019t speak nonsense! When did I poison you? You\u2026 You can\u2019t just set me up like this!\u201d\u201cI was there and it was obviously you who poisoned Ye Xiao! Your dirty tricks can never escape my eyes!\u201d Lan Lang-Lang had his eyes wide open, \u201cOtherwise how could Ye Xiao actually have gotten drunk after only a few glasses\u2026\u201dWang Xiao-Nian\u2019s face turned pale white and it looked like he would be spitting out blood any second now, \u201cWHAT! Getting drunk too quickly equals\u2026 being poisoned?!\u201d\u201cYes! Yes it is! So what?\u201d\u201cWang Xiao-Nian you work this thing out today!\u201d\u201cOtherwise we will tear your house apart today\u2026\u201dThe three lads were like monsters. They were importunately talking nonsense and running off their mouths. Apparently they were just looking for a bone in an egg [1]. Wang Xiao-Nian felt anxious, angry and wronged and he almost cried.What could he do anyway, facing the three most unreasonable men in the capital?Ye Xiao had actually been poisoned in the Shan-Hua House. That night, Wang Xiao-Nian had actually been hanging around with these three foppish lords. Besides, his father, Wang Da-Nian, actually had close connections with the Shan-Hua House\u2026Due to these reasons, Ye Xiao suspected the Wang clan\u2026The question was\u2026 Although Wang Xiao-Nian had never been a good person, would he really stoop to such a low level as to poison someone who attended the Shan-Hua House?Ye Xiao and the other two foppish lords were throwing random words out, pretending the truth to be a mere lie, leaving Wang Xiao-Nian desperately searching for a way out, as large beads of sweat were dripping down his face. They were showing the attitude which said: \u201cApparently we are pinching you, so what? Bite me!\u201dZuo Wu-Ji had the Minister Zuo in his family; Ye Xiao had the Northern General; Lan Lang-Lang had the Southern General. These three officers were truly someone Wang Xiao-Nian\u2019s father could not afford to displease.In another word, if the three officers took a little action against him, he wouldn\u2019t have a chance to get away even though he had a crown prince behind him\u2026 If the three clans fought together against the Wang clan, how could the crown prince offend three of the most influential figures in the government at the same time for a mere leader of the guards?\u201cYou are unscrupulous! How dare you poison me!\u201d Ye Xiao looked fierce.\u201cYou are heartless! How dare you poison Ye Xiao! I am the witness! I saw it with my own eyes!\u201d Lan Lang-Lang was thrilled and shouted.\u201cYou are perverse! You actually poisoned Ye Xiao!\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji went along cheerfully.\u201cYou betrayed your family! You are worse than a beast! You are against the gods! You are horrific! You actually poisoned Ye Xiao!\u201d Lan Lang-Lang spoke smoothly and actually came out with such sophisticated words. Words like these were something he wouldn\u2019t be able to think of in normal circumstances\u2026 However, there was even a \u2018you betrayed your family\u2019 in it. It seemed like he had gone a little bit over the top\u2026\u201cI\u2026I\u2026 I didn\u2019t poison you\u2026 I did not\u2026 I don\u2019t even know what poison it was\u2026\u201d By this time Wang Xiao-Nian was on the verge of crying. Suddenly, his father, Wang Da-Nian barged in.When he saw Ye Xiao standing right inside his house, his facial expression changed at once.The next moment when he heard the words \u2018actually poisoned Ye Xiao\u2019, he felt faint and nearly fell down the stairs. His face had turned extremely pale.These moves, that were obvious mistakes from a panicking person, were absolutely something that he, as the leader of the guards in the Crown Prince Palace, wasn\u2019t supposed to make!Wang Da-Nian composed himself quickly and walked forward. Fawningly he said, \u201cOh, what an honor for me to have you three lords here. Honored guests! You lit up my humble house, really!\u201d Then he turned to his son, \u201cYou rascal! We have the three lords here and you haven\u2019t even prepared tea for them yet! Is this how I raised you, to ignore your guests like this?\u201dIn fact Ye Xiao had noticed Wang Da-Nian\u2019s strange reaction earlier. The changes in his face and stumbling moves, Ye Xiao had seen them clearly. He quickly deduced the truth of this matter and sneered.\u201cDad\u2026\u201d Wang Xiao-Nian had been feeling depressed, but luckily his father had shown up now as his savior, \u201cAbout that night, it was obvious that Ye Xiao was poor at alcohol and got drunk. Now he intentionally insists that I have poisoned him. He would have died long ago if he was truly poisoned. How could he be swaggering around here\u2026 He\u2026He is obviously bullying me, isn\u2019t he?\u201cPoor at alcohol and got drunk?\u201d Wang Da-Nian was confused.At this moment, his face was really strange \u2013 a face which could only be described as weird.Ye Xiao stepped forward and was slightly shaking his body. He stared at him and said loudly, \u201cThat night it was your son\u2019s treat. He poisoned me! I need an explanation for that right away!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLan Lang-Lang felt interested and stepped forward too, \u201cThat\u2019s right! I saw it with my own eyes. I am the witness. Your son poisoned Ye Xiao! The evidence is conclusive! Do you still want to deny it?!\u201dWang Da-Nian spoke carefully, \u201cPoison? If you don\u2019t mind, lord Ye, would you care to tell me how my son poisoned you and what poison it was?!\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013[1] A Chinese idiom. The phrase means trying deliberately to find a fault with someone or something faultless. The idiom is often used to describe someone who is very picky, who finds faults with others on purpose.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

How the hell would I know how he poisoned me? As for what poison it was, honestly you should ask your baby boy. What the hell do I know about it? The only thing I know is that I am a heavy drinker with a hollow leg, and that night I got fxxking drunk after just three shots.\u201d Ye Xiao said viciously, \u201cI spent the whole night sleeping. What could I be if I wasn\u2019t poisoned?!\u201d\u201cUrh\u2026\u201d Wang Da-Nian couldn\u2019t believe him and said, \u201cIf you had been poisoned like you said, it should not have been this easy for you to recover, right? And now you are here, all fine and healthy. It means you were not poisoned. Right?\u201dWhen Wang Xiao-Nian saw his father, he thought his savior had come. When he saw that his father totally lost his usual vigour, acting weird and arguing powerlessly, he seriously felt disappointed.How could he realize that Wang Da-Nian was seriously shocked.Wang Da-Nain was arguing with his mouth, but feeling different in his mind, \u201cWho on earth cured him? Who was it? That should be incurable. How could it be cured? Who on earth knows how to deal with such powerful poison? This is so bloody weird\u2026\u201d\u201cI did get poisoned anyway! I got drunk only for three shots. That\u2019s the evidence. Lan Lang-Lang was there. He is the witness. There are both evidence and witness. How dare you disavow it?\u201d Ye Xiao didn\u2019t want to be reasonable at all, \u201cI was poisoned and I want your explanation! Otherwise, let\u2019s find someone to check my body. Ok, I will send for a royal doctor to check my body carefully. Let\u2019s see how you continue feigning. Humph\u2026\u201d\u201cThat is surely unnecessary.\u201d Wang Da-Nian was scared. He thought, \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t know who cured this bastard\u2019s poison, which was supposed to be fxxking incurable. It may remain inside his body and if it is found out, I will go to hell\u2026 Ye Nan-Tian will definitely come and wipe my family out. This foppish bastard came here only to get some advantages. I think it will be fine if I give him some money and send him away.\u201d\u201cHahahahaha\u2026\u201d Wang Da-Nian made the decision and laughed, \u201cI see. Lord Ye drank too much that night\u2026\u201d\u201cWho says I drank too much?\u201d Ye Xiao was angry, \u201cI was obviously poisoned!\u201d\u201cFine\u2026 Fine\u2026 Let\u2019s say you were poisoned.\u201d Wang Da-Nian simpered, \u201cOk then, what \u2018explanation\u2019 would you like, lord Ye?\u201dYe Xiao was surprised and turned to Lan Lang-Lang, \u201cWhat do we want?\u201dLan Lang-Lang was surprised too and couldn\u2019t find anything to say. He rolled his eyes and swallowed, before sneakily kicking Zuo Wu Ji\u2019s foot.Zuo Wu-Ji was rolling his eyes, trying to think of something he wanted, but failed. Ye Xiao suddenly frowned and murmured like he realized something, \u201cOh right\u2026 wasn\u2019t there this six-hundred years old\u2026 hmm\u2026 what was it\u2026 hmm\u2026\u201d\u201cBlood ginseng!\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji suddenly remembered what they\u2019d been discussing before coming here. He shouted excitingly, \u201cGive the blood ginseng to Ye Xiao as compensation, otherwise we won\u2019t let you get away from this!\u201d\u201cExactly! You will not get away this time! Lord Ye was badly weakened because of your poison. He won\u2019t recover unless he gets something nutritional!\u201d Lan Lang-Lang was delighted and shouted spiritedly.\u201cThis is totally unfair!\u201d Wang Xiao-Nian got really angry and his face turned red. He yelled, \u201cYou bastards! You actually want to extort our ginseng! You must be crazy! You are making a huge mistake bastards! I am going to\u2026\u201dHis mouth was covered by his father before he finished speaking.\u201cYou are gonna do what?\u201d Ye Xiao sneered, \u201cYou tried to kill me but failed and got caught. Now you want to deny your guilt. What? Do you even want to kill us all to cover your sin?! Wang Xiao-Nian, how dare you? You actually want to murder us! Are you trying to be a rebel?\u201dLan Lang-Lang and Zuo Wu-Ji went along with him, \u201cWang Xiao-Nian, are you trying to be a rebel? We are witnesses!\u201dWang Xiao-Nian breathed heavily, \u201cYou\u2026 You bastards\u2026\u201d He could hardly utter a word.\u201cBlood ginseng it is then!\u201d Wang Da-Nian agreed immediately, \u201cSince you, the three lords, want it, I can only submit and agree with your terms, but you must promise me one thing\u2026\u201dHe was sad and angry, and he quavered, \u201cI am only a low-position guard. I wouldn\u2019t dare to argue with you three lords\u2026 But from this point onwards, please forget about this issue with the poison\u2026 I can bear it this time. It is nothing but spending some money to avert trouble. However\u2026 you should know that everyone has a temper and even a rabbit will bite if it is pissed\u2026\u201d\u201cDad!!!\u201d Wang Xiao-Nian had shock covering his face, as he stared at his father with wide open eyes.He wouldn\u2019t imagine that his strong father had actually submitted to the three foppish lords.\u201cShut up!\u201d Wang Da-Nian shouted angrily.\u201cA rabbit will bite\u2026 A rabbit\u2026 Hahahaha\u2026.\u201d Lan Lang-Lang laughed and rubbed his favus infested head. On the opposite side Wang Da-Nian and his son turned red in their faces. They looked so angry, almost as if they wanted to swallow somebody.\u201cOf course.\u201d Ye Xiao pushed Lan Lang-Lang aside and said, \u201cA wise man should not tease the weak. He who leaves some leeway, will always make new friends. We are not unprincipled\u2026\u201dEveryone felt sick about what Ye Xiao had said, including Lan Lang-Lang and Zuo Wu-Ji. Their faces distorted and it looked like they were about to puke a mouthful of blood.Ye Xiao had extorted a six hundred years old ginseng by making trouble out of nothing and arguing irrationally\u2026 if that wasn\u2019t the pinnacle of being unprincipled, then who in this world could possible be considered unprincipled?.\u201c\u2026 Don\u2019t worry about it. If your baby boy didn\u2019t flaunt that he had a six hundred years old ginseng and that he would use it to boost his cultivation and beat us up\u2026 and most importantly, if he hadn\u2019t poisoned me\u2026 as a noble-minded, knightly, gentle and brave gentleman, why would I make trouble for him? I usually will not even look at small fries like your son. And none of us three are interested in rabbits\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao talked like he was a sage with a lofty attitude\u2026\u201cI see.\u201d Wang Da-Nian heard what Ye Xiao said and felt a slight sensation of relief forming in his stomach. He turned to his son and shouted, \u201cRascal! You were going about flaunting my riches! You truly are a black sheep! When will you finally let me be free of worries\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Wang Xiao-Nian opened his mouth but couldn\u2019t say a word. He felt that his blood had accumulated at his throat and he had great difficulty to keep it in his mouth and not spray it around the room.\u201cGo get the ginseng and give it to lord Ye.\u201d Wang Da-Nian sighed. He felt unwilling to give this rascal the ginseng. but he felt like he had no other choice, so he told his son to go fetch it.\u201cDad!!!\u201d Wang Xiao-Nian shouted bitterly. But, when he saw Wang Da-Nian\u2019s face turning green, he didn\u2019t dare to disobey and walked to his room completely depressed. It looked like his soul had departed early from his body, leaving it to walk this earth soulless.\u201cLord Ye!\u201d Wang Da-Nian took a deep breath, \u201cShall we get all of this over with already?\u201dYe Xiao smiled, \u201cSure. Absolutely. I am a tolerant man after all. I won\u2019t bother with your stupid son anymore!\u201dWang Da-Nian felt relief, \u201cLord Ye, a man who can not be trusted is an unwelcome guest to any party. I hope you will keep your promise\u2026 But if you don\u2019t\u2026 I might not be able to stand your behavior anymore.\u201d\u201cHaha, of course I will keep my promise. What am I? An honest man.\u201d Ye Xiao said disdainfully and thought, \u201cKeep my promise to you? In your dreams! Pooh\u2026\u201dWang Xiao-Nian was returning from his room, moving extremely slowly, hoping a miracle to fly down from the heavens and save his precious ginseng. He was holding a small box as he walked through the door. Ye Xiao shouted, \u201cQuick! Bring me my ginseng! Don\u2019t dawdle! It is mine no matter how much you dawdle!\u201d\u201cDad\u2026 I really didn\u2019t poison him\u2026\u201d Wang Xiao-Nian looked at his father sincerely. He was trying to make his last effort to keep the ginseng. The blood ginseng was a crucial steppingstone on his long path of cultivation.Wang Xiao-Nian still didn\u2019t understand why his father would give up such a valuable treasure and hand it over to the good for nothing foppish lord Ye. He, of course, couldn\u2019t know what his father was thinking. So he had no clue that there was nothing he could do to change the current chain of events.Wang Da-Nian sighed and thought, \u201cYou silly boy. If it wasn\u2019t for what I\u2019ve done and the fact lord Ye is standing right here in front of me, how would I ever let them take our blood ginseng with such ease? They were only standing here making trouble out of nothing\u2026\u201d\u201cGive it to lord Ye, son. Let\u2019s admit our misfortune.\u201d Wang Da-Nian waved his hand and said hopelessly. He was thinking, \u201cI can\u2019t afford it to be stubborn right now anyway. The poison\u2026 even it has really been cured\u2026 I know it will still need at least an entire year for it to completely leave his system. Ye Xiao is acting especially lively. That most likely means that he has a detoxifying expert helping him. Maybe Ye Xiao is a little bit muddleheaded, but that detoxifying expert behind him must have known what has happened. If I don\u2019t give up now, I will only be putting a curse onto myself. I might even put the curse on my family or even on my entire bloodline. I will just let this bastard have this little advantage\u2026 I may have lost a simple blood ginseng, but now I\u2019ve learned that Ye Xiao has actually survived the poison. It is not all bad!\u201dYe Xiao rushed forward and quickly grabbed the blood ginseng. He laughed and turned around to face Lan Lang-Lang and Zuo Wu-Ji, \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dThe three foppish lords were leaving full of vigor and feeling completely refreshed.\u201cYe Xiao, I will never leave your side!\u201d Wang Xiao-Nian shouted while trying to catch up.\u201cHahahaha\u2026 We will have a lot of time ahead of us to play these games! I am not afraid of rabbits, let alone biting rabbits!\u201d Ye Xiao\u2019s voice was coming from far down the street. They had already made quite a distance from the Wang family house.\u201cDad, Ye Xiao was obviously not poisoned! They were obviously here to extort us! They were only here to take the blood ginseng!\u201d Wang Xiao-Nian felt like heaven was playing a trick on him and asked his father sadly, \u201cWhy did you\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cShut up!\u201d Wang Da-Nian\u2019s face twitched and his eyes turned vicious. He breathed heavily and was about to say something but he stopped. Then he just said, \u201cStay at home. Don\u2019t leave the house. I need to go somewhere.\u201dThen he turned around and hurriedly left.At the same time, Ye Xiao was holding the blood ginseng with one hand and waving with the other, \u201cLet\u2019s go back to my place, let\u2019s celebrate this victory with some drinks! My treat!!\u201dZuo Wu-Ji and Lan Lang-Lang were totally impressed, \u201cLord Ye, you have really extorted the ginseng! We could have never expected Wang Da-Nian to be such a pussy\u2026\u201dYe Xiao\u2019s mouth twitched upon hearing these words. He was thinking, \u201cIt is not because Wang Da-Nian is a pussy\u2026 Instead\u2026 it is because the departed lord Ye has sacrificed his life for this blood ginseng\u2026 I was just the lucky one to take it in his name\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 16 \u2013 The Dreams Of A Simple DudeCurrently, the three lords were at Ye Xiao\u2019s house, partaking a grand 3 person feast.On the table there were delicacies of every kind accompanied with fine liquor. It was surely a regular affair for the General Ye\u2019s Residence to hold a small feast like this. Ye Xiao was in high spirits and he spoke a lot. The blood ginseng had already shriveled up even as it remained locked within the box. Its essence had already been absorbed into the space of the sphere, and was quietly being digested over there.The steward had silently entered the room and had stopped right besides Ye Xiao.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Ye Xiao asked kindly.\u201cHere\u2019s the thing, my lord\u2026 After you left the Wang\u2019s residence, Wang Da-Nian left at once,\u201d the steward spoke carefully, \u201cand headed for the Crown Prince\u2019s Palace.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d Ye Xiao frowned and looked up at the steward.He wasn\u2019t surprised that Wang Da-Nian would leave for the Crown Prince\u2019s Palace, after all that is what he had tried to lead him into doing. What actually surprised him was how the steward had followed it up.The steward had actually thought of following the tracks and had apparently made preparations for it beforehand\u2026That wasn\u2019t something an ordinary person could or would do.\u201cThe steward\u2026 is actually not an ordinary person!\u201d Thought Ye Xiao as he was staring at the man in front of him.The steward showed calmness under Ye Xiao\u2019s eyes. He then spoke gently, \u201cExcuse me.\u201d He turned to the door and walked humbly and honestly like always.But Ye Xiao had changed his evaluation of the steward.The General,Ye Nan-Tian, was always out at war. The man he trusted to look after the house and be in charge in his absence, couldn\u2019t be just some ordinary person.After finishing the food along with several drinks, Ye Xiao asked, \u201cBy the way, you know, the three of us are currently just fooling around everyday\u2026 May I ask the two of you about your plans for the future?\u201d\u201cFuture? Plans?\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji smiled and said, \u201cWhat future can I have in my life? What plan can I have? I was fxxking gifted with infertility by the heavens. Having such a sickness is something a man will disclose, as it will only arouse mocking laughter from everyone around them. Somebody has already told the world about mine. The whole capital knows that the second son of the Minister Zuo has a disabled shaft! How can I hold my head up when I go outside? What is there for me to plan for? How can a loser like me expect to have any kind future? I will just waste away!\u201dHe had guzzled up three glasses of wine during the short time he had been speaking.Zuo Wu-Ji drank quickly. Heartrending sadness was expressed on his pretty face, \u201cYou know what. Now in those brothels, those girls who are not willing to go past simple performances like customers like me the most, because they know even if they are naked in front of me, there is nothing I can do\u2026 Ye Xiao, do you think there could be any kind of plan for people like me?\u201dYe Xiao sighed lightly. In fact he really felt sorry for Zuo, as any man could understand the suffering arising from lacking the functions of their lower regions.As he was collecting his thoughts, he suddenly remembered the existence of a dan in the Qing-Yun Realm, called the Male Recovery Dan. This dan was definitely not a high grade treasure\u2013 it barely qualified as a 5th grade dan. This grade 5 dan had only a single function though. Neither was it useful for cultivation nor could it save one\u2019s life, but when it came to revitalizing one\u2019s infertility, this dan was the answer. In other words, it was a superior invigorant.The Xiao Monarch, of course, wouldn\u2019t care about this kind of dan. However, for some average cultivators, especially those lewd ones, this dan was absolutely worth every single penny.For people like Zuo Wu-Ji who were born with a slight defect between their legs, only a single dan bead would be required to accomplish a complete recovery.Moreover, since Zuo Wu-Ji\u2019s physical condition was poor, if he ate one piece of the Male Recovery Dan, he would not only get rid of his infertility, but also improve his body strength!After all, a grade 5 dan in the Qing-Yun Realm would definitely be considered to be a legendary dan in the mortal world!After he thought for a while, Ye Xiao\u2019s eyes lit up, \u201cDon\u2019t be so full of despair. Your sickness is not something which is incurable\u2026 Let\u2019s assume you can get rid of your infertility problem. In such a scenario, what would you do?\u201dZuo Wu-Ji took a deep breath and said sadly, \u201cI know that you are just comforting me, but this natural-born disease is absolutely incurable. I know it is an absurd hope but\u2026 if it can be cured, I hope\u2026\u201d his eyes suddenly lit up, \u201cthat I can become a well-known officer. I will stand besides the king and subjugate the whole world. I will be the one who stands only below the king but above all the others. I will leave my honor in history and be praised by every generation in the future! I will innovate the government and fight against the corruption within.\u201d\u201cI learn about politics day and night and I learn from everything I see. Any chance that I can find to learn or get experience in governing, I grab it with both of my hands. And then I will think about how to improve it, how to unite everyone, how to guide the country and how to be the best politician\u2026\u201dHe smiled sadly, \u201cIt may sound ironic but\u2026 Everyday when I fool around with the two of you, I might look unambitious\u2026 But when you two are sleeping with some girls at night, I will sneak off and go home\u2026 I will read my books and collect my mind to calm myself down\u2026 Because when there is nothing to keep myself busy with\u2026 All that I can think of at that time is to commit suicide so that my mind can finally be set free\u2026\u201dYe Xiao and Lan Lang-Lang were completely silent.They had never thought that the number one black sheep of the capital, Zuo Wu-Ji, would actually possess such ambition and such dedication!\u201cI know. No matter how hard I struggle, nothing will change\u2026 Stories of my natural born infertility have been spreading in the air for far too long\u2026 No matter what talent I might possess and how smart I might be, in the eyes of the king, I might only be considered as a eunuch. I can only be disgraced by the world and be made into a laughingstock.\u201dZuo Wu-Ji had by now guzzled up another three glasses. He smiled with self-mockery, \u201cYou know what. Except to pee, the thing between my legs is completely useless\u2026\u201dHearing his self-mockery, Ye Xiao and Lan Lang-Lang couldn\u2019t help but feeling depression quickly taking over the mood of the room.\u201cGal No.7, I was wrong.\u201d Lan Lang-Lang said guiltily, \u201cI won\u2019t call you Gal No.7 anymore\u2026\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji stared at him while rage seemed to be boiling up inside of him, but he quickly stopped and said with a voice full of sorrow, \u201cI always imagine that if I am cured someday, I will have four wives and be chased after by lots of pretty girls, and I will be the most romantic officer and a decorated loyalist! Haha, how is it? Isn\u2019t my dream hilarious? Maybe my dream is too unrealisable. What a ridiculous wish!\u201dYe Xiao sighed and held Zuo Wu-Ji\u2019s shoulder, \u201cHave you never considered cultivating, so you can become an immortal? Travel around the world and rule over all your enemies with an iron fist?\u201dZuo Wu-Ji shook his head and said, \u201cI am really not all that interested in those cultivators! No matter how powerful a cultivator becomes, all he does is fight and slaughter to obtain a few profits. An intellectual can devise strategies and preside the battle from thousands of miles away. One word, one decision, each of them can change the lives of every resident in the world for the better!\u201d\u201cThat will be enough for me in my short life.\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji said.Ye Xiao was shocked. During the conversation, he had found out that Zuo Wu-Ji had possessed a virtue \u2013 fortitude. In fact, Zuo Wu-Ji had always shown this virtue, but no one had ever cared enough to notice.A man who was born with a pair of disabled balls, was able to look straight at his own defects and bear with the endless mocking eyes and words. He could even overcome such challenges with an unabated dream! Ye Xiao didn\u2019t think that he could do any better than Zuo Wu-Ji if he were to stand in his shoes \u2013 He might even opt to suicide to obtain total freedom, like Zuo Wu-Ji had said!\u201cThere are only things we can\u2019t think of, but absolutely nothing we can\u2019t deal with. As long as you imagine bravely, there is always a chance to realise it.\u201d Ye Xiao nodded and said gravely, \u201cThe pioneer and the unique, the most romantic politician who stands only below the king and upon the others in the history \u2013 handsome, strong, incorruptible and honorable lord Zuo!\u201dZuo Wu-Ji was about to get angry but stopped when he saw Ye Xiao\u2019s serious face, then he asked doubtfully, \u201cAre you actually serious right now?\u201d\u201cI do have an idea to cure your disease.\u201d Ye Xiao spoke slowly.Even a man with fortitude would freak out. He had to comfort Zuo Wu-Ji first, because due to Zuo Wu-Ji\u2019s present mental condition, he might lose his mind before he got to fully use the Male Recovery Dan.\u201cWhat?! You?\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji\u2019s eyes lit up and his breath became heavy, like the sound of bellows being played.\u201cI can cure you, really.\u201d Ye Xiao said seriously, \u201cWell\u2026 I am sadly not able to do so right at this moment. Your disease is beyond ordinary treatments. The special treatment that is required to restore your manhood takes time to prepare. Zuo Wu-Ji, if you trust me, wait for one year! In no more than one year, I promise you, I can man you up!\u201dZuo Wu-Ji looked at him with a serious expression plastered on his face, until he eventually smiled, \u201cAbsolutely! Deal! I will wait. I have been waiting for eighteen years. Why don\u2019t I way for another year?\u201dLan Lang-Lang giggled, \u201cEighteen years\u2026 Good for you. So you have been thinking about girls since you were born? Admirable!\u201dThe three of them started laughing.\u201cEr Lang [1], how about you?\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji felt relieved, because he had finally been able to talk about the sorrow that had been hidden deep within his heart for many years. He had even made fun of Lan Lang-Lang \u2013 calling Lan Lang-Lang by his nickname, which he hated more than anything in this world.\u201cZuo Wu-Ji!\u201d Lan Lang-Lang nearly exploded, \u201cI am warning you one last time! Don\u2019t call me Er Lang! You can call me brother Lan, or call me Lang! My life may be full of Lang, but there is absolutely no \u2018Er\u2019! I hate \u2018Er\u2019!\u201d\u201cLang~~~\u201d Ye Xiao and Zuo Wu-Ji burst out laughing and nearly fell off their seats.\u201cCome on, Lang! Spit it out! What do you want to do?\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji had decided to call him \u2018Lang\u2019 from now on.Lan Lang-Lang rubbed his head. He didn\u2019t like the way this single word, Lang, sounded when it was pronounced with a low voice. He was, however, the one who had suggested it, so he had to bear with it.He then surprised the other two by declaring, \u201cI have ten wishes.\u201d\u201cNumber 1, to cure my favus infested head.\u201d Lan Lang-Lang rubbed his head.Puff! Ye Xiao spit out the wine and Zuo Wu-Ji couldn\u2019t stop laughing.\u201cNumber 2, my family will no longer restrain me in any way, so I can finally be free to do as I please.\u201d Lan Lang-Lang ignored the laughter from the other two as he continued listing his whishes, \u201cNumber 3, I want to be so rich that even multiple warehouses become insufficient to store all my money in! Number 4, I don\u2019t want to work for the government. I\u2019m not interested in learning either martial arts or literature. Number 5, I want to have a beautiful wife. I don\u2019t need three or four wives; a single thoughtful and beautiful one is enough. Number 6, my family will be healthy all their lives, peacefully dying once they have reached the threshold of 100 years of age. Number 7\u2026\u201dLan Lang-Lang didn\u2019t stop and listed out all his wishes. He had actually not been joking when he had said that he had 10 wishes. The last wish was, \u201c\u2026 Number 10, we will be best friends forever. Like, even when we are eighty years old, we will still fool around together. Then when we eventually turn a 100 years old, we will finish our last dinner together before peacefully closing our eyes one last time\u2026 Together\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLan Lang-Lang clicked his tongue and then said wishfully, \u201cSuch a great future. I feel delighted just thinking about it\u2026\u201dYe Xiao and Zuo Wu-Ji were speechless.Although they knew that Lan Lang-Lang was cherishing their brotherhood, the words that had come out from his mouth were a little bit over the top for them! They were thinking, \u201cWHAT?! What do you mean \u2018closing our eyes one last time\u2026Together\u2019, you fool?!\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014[1] Er: The pronunciation of the Chinese character \u201c\u4e8c\u201d.

What\u2019s your plan?\u201d Lan Lang-Lang and Zuo Wu-Ji asked Ye Xiao in unison.Ye Xiao actually looked perplexed and seemingly lost for words, as his plan was totally different from theirs.\u201cI\u2026 I want to be an expert cultivator.\u201d Ye Xiao spoke seriously, \u201cAn invincible one.\u201d\u201cHahahahaha\u2026 an expert cultivator?! Invincible?!\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji and Lan Lang-Lang felt their legs go weak and their stomachs cried out in pain from their laughter. Tears were falling down their cheeks due to laughing excessively.The foppish and lazy lord Ye Xiao actually wanted to be an invincible expert cultivator. That was perhaps the biggest joke they\u2019d had the pleasure of hearing in the entirety of their short lives.Ye Xiao was stunned, \u201cSeriously? Is my plan that unbelievable?!\u201dThe two of them had had barely any time to recover from their previous outburst of laughter, before they felt their knees go weak again and the pain in their stomach resurface as laughter once more rang throughout general Ye\u2019s manor.\u201cHonestly, in everyone\u2019s eyes we are just three foppish playboys. What dreams could we have? What decent future could we plan\u2026\u201d Lan Lang-Lang laughed, \u201cThis conversation is fine in here, where it can be kept private. Because if people outside heard of these dreams, they would definitely laugh their teeth off.\u201dIn fact, except for Ye Xiao, none of them would even dare to dream that the plans they were currently talking about, would all eventually turn into reality!Zuo Wu-Ji would hold the greatest political power \u2013 with which he would wield the scepter and dominate the world, while Lan Lang-Lang would become extremely wealthy and become an unrestricted aristocrat and Ye Xiao would become a supreme cultivator with unfathomable strength!Oh, however, Lang\u2019s final dream \u2013 to finish their last dinner and then die together, would never materialize.\u2026\u201cWhat is a foppish playboy?\u201d Ye Xiao frowned and asked.These days he kept organizing his inherited memory and he realized that Lan Lang-Lang and Zuo Wu-Ji were not some wicked lads like he had imagined. At least they had never done anything dirty, like bullying and oppressing innocent people. Maybe the biggest problem they had, was just being disappointing\u2026But, should they be regarded as foppish playboys because of that?\u201cDisappointing!\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji smiled with self-mockery, \u201cAll those good lads are following the rules. They go to the colleges, seek their teachers and practise the way of martial arts. All they are fighting for are the honors of their clans and good reputations of themselves. They try their best to get into the government so that they can contribute for their clans, or become the leaders of their clans.\u201d\u201cPeople like us are regarded as losers that are useless and have no ambitions. We are only playboys and black sheep.\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji smiled bitterly, \u201cNormally in the wealthy clans, those who often go to the brothels and bully the innocents will be called the black sheep. But things are different in our clans\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat makes us the black sheep is that we have no ambitions. Ambition means everything!\u201d Lan Lang-Lang said sadly.\u201cUrh.\u201d Ye Xiao frowned, \u201cWhat I hate most, is bullying!\u201d\u201cAha, haha, ha! Well isn\u2019t that exactly what you did to rob someone today?!\u201d Lan Lang-Lang and Zuo Wu-Ji laughed.After dinner, Lan Lang-Lang and Zuo Wu-Ji walked to the door preparing to leave. Before they left, Lan Lang-Lang seemed to have a bright insight in his drunken state. He spoke to Zuo Wu-Ji, \u201cHey dude, so all these years\u2026 have you been showing us your disguise?\u201dZuo Wu-Ji smiled bitterly, \u201cI have disguised myself for such a long time. Now the disguise has become my identity. I have been unable to tell if it is true or false.\u201dThey laughed again loudly and then left side by side.Ye Xiao stood at the door and felt blank.He felt touched by the conversation they\u2019d had during their feast. How many people like them\u2026 were actually showing their real faces?Lan Lang-Lang and Zuo Wu-Ji were not. But who was?Maybe the departed Ye Xiao\u2026 was actually a foppish playboy inside \u2013 so he died.In his prior life Ye Xiao had never seen things from this perspective \u2013 the point of view he has in this present life. He could clearly feel that it was a life lesson of outmost importance.He knew clearly that the way in which he perceived the world had such drastic changes, making him feel he was looking at the world through the eyes of someone else. Even so, the world he was living in and the realms that were in this world, were all still the exact same as they had been in his previous life.Ye Xiao smiled, \u201cIt is always in this world, no matter where I live. There are always roads, no matter where I stand. Where do we sing and laugh; where do we weep and cry? \u2026\u201dWhen he just finished the last word of the poem, Ye Xiao calmly entered the space of the sphere.Yet when he arrived inside, surprise quickly replaced the calmness on his face.The qi in the space was obviously heavier than before. There was some white qi mixed in there along with some purple qi. And there was another qi that was different from the original ones \u2013 a blood-color qi that was barely noticeable.That must be the qi from the essence of the blood ginseng.Besides, there was a smell of plants. It was a lively smell of life \u2013 the purest smell of nature.This natural smell was certainly brought by the blood ginseng too.Ye Xiao realized that the blood ginseng he brought was the first plant absorbed by the sphere, and it had contained the qi of life.He then walked along the purple tunnel and found that the qi here was heavier, just as he had expected. He took a deep breath and then felt relaxed and happy.He walked around for a moment and then prepared to get out for cultivating, but when he turned to the entrance, he suddenly felt that something was different. He quickly turned back and observed the room carefully, until he finally found it\u2026The egg!It had become bigger!It was as big as a duck\u2019s egg before, but now it had grown bigger still. It was at least as big as a goose\u2019s egg now.\u201cOh? This thing could actually grow?\u201d Ye Xiao was surprised, \u201cIt was truly an egg of a mythical creature. I haven\u2019t seen any eggs that can actually grow\u2026\u201dThat was truly his first time seeing something like this, even while counting both of his lives.Ye Xiao was certain that it was a mythical creature\u2019s egg!Because the egg was really felt amazing and mysterious.Peerless lord in the world and foremost spirit in chaos!The sphere was very arrogant, so it must be something outstanding. The egg inside it with endless qi must be something beyond the ordinary. \u201cIt must be a top-grade mythical creature!\u201d He thought.Since Ye Xiao had first come in contact with this egg, he had frequently been lost in thought. When would it finally hatch and what kind of creature would be born from it? He was even starting to dream about a creature so powerful that it could swallow the entire Qinq-Yun Realm with just a single gulp!He touched the egg and found it to be cold. But he couldn\u2019t feel any rhythm of a living creature. He murmured, \u201cYou are such a powerful being. How powerful will you be? \u2026\u201dYe Xiao was delighted. He left the space and sat cross-legged to cultivate so as to improve his strength. The qi in the space then went into his Jing and Mai like streams to assist his cultivation.Other than the qi from the sphere, the qi, that was scattered throughout the world, gathered around Ye Xiao to assist in his cultivation too. The path that the qi traversed was however invisible. Nobody, not even the expert cultivators, could sense the moves of the qi in the world. The purest qi was quietly absorbed by the space and then flowed into Ye Xiao\u2019s Jing and Mai\u2026When the world was built, the purple qi rose from the east!Another night had passed. At the moment when the sun shined its first light, Ye Xiao felt an indescribable throb!This was his first time that he truly performed the East-rising Purple Qi and felt the purple rising qi!At the moment, the sky lit up at once with sunshine. The next moment, his Ni-Wan Acupoint[1] suddenly beat, tak tak tak\u2026His blood began to boil all at once!His hair suddenly stood up, pointing at the ceiling!In his Dantian, a wave of power that had stayed dormant suddenly rushed up\u2026 All the way toward his scalp!Boom! Bang!It felt like there was a wave of qi breaking through the top of his head. His entire body was filled with an indescribable feeling of relief!He felt that he was bathing in a bathtub filled with warm water, and the heat spread all over his body. He was experiencing all of these conditions at this moment.Ye Xiao mind was now completely blank and he couldn\u2019t speak out a single word.Massive qi was breaking through in his body. Within his mind, he saw that there were stars dancing, three flowers blossoming and five streams flowing!Ye Xiao was quickly taken over by surprise.It was the sign of breaking through the first grade of the Grade of Diyuan!Could it be that he had already reached the second grade of the Grade of Diyuan?\u201cThat\u2026 It shouldn\u2019t be. I just broke through the first grade of the East-rising Purple Qi several days ago and became an expert cultivator of the Grade of Diyuan. How did I improve myself by this much so quickly?This is insane!How can a six hundred years old blood ginseng have such efficacy?Although I have only used one blood ginseng \u2013 even if I had used ten, It couldn\u2019t be possible for me to break through the first level of the Grade of Diyuan in such a short amount of time.\u201d He thought.Ye Xiao recalled that when he reached the same level in his prior life, he had suffered immense pains, comparable to the feeling of his Jing and Mai melting. However, this time he felt really comfortable.That is so simple, so easy and so comfortable!Ye Xiao immediately began to execute the East-rising Purple Qi, and then he learnt that it was still only at the first grade, even though his normal cultivation had apparently possessed immense improvements!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cComparing the level system of cultivation and the level system of the East-rising Purple Qi\u2026 How big is the gap between them?\u201d Ye Xiao could be regarded as an expert cultivator in this mortal world now, but he was still only at the first grade of the East-rising Purple Qi.Ye Xiao felt stunned when he thought of this.It was an extreme excitement that flowed through his veins, \u201cIf I improve my East-rising Purple Qi to the top grade, I will\u2026 Live forever\u2026 And become a legend, right?!\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014[1] Ni-Wan Acupoint: An acupoint on the crown of the head.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He took a long and deep breath to calm the raging blood in his body. As he did, his eyes quickly became brighter.As of this moment, Ye Xiao was unaware of the East-rising Purple Qi\u2019s power. Not just that, he also didn\u2019t realize that when he would eventually reach the peak of the East-rising Purple Qi cultivation, he would become much more than a simple immortal existence. He would become an unparalleled legend!Right now, all that Ye Xiao knew was that the awful smell from before had returned and that he badly needed a bath to clean the filth covering him. His body was completely covered by a disgusting layer of brown sticky outer skin with big beads of sweat dripping in between. These were the impurities found in every simple human being and only once one started on their journey of cultivation could they expel them out of their body.This state of the body was something every cultivator wished to attain. It was the important ablution of muscles and bones, as he had successfully broken through the first level of the Grade of Diyuan and had entered the second grade!For the current Xiao Monarch, this was an absolutely outstanding accomplishment!He had already achieved two ablutions of his muscles and bones. To achieve just one ablution was an incredible achievement, but to actually achieve a second one, and in such a short time as well, was definitely unheard of!As Ye Xiao stood up, he felt the bones in his body crack. As he fully straightened his back, he realized that he had actually grown a little bit taller over the course of this single night.After Ye Xiao had properly cleaned his body from the disgusting filth in a nice and comfortable warm bath, he turned to look in a mirror and gasped in admiration for the image he perceived, \u201cI am so bloody handsome! The girl I will eventually marry must definitely possess many generations of her family\u2019s good fortune\u2026\u201dCoincidently, the steward walked to the door and heard what Ye Xiao was saying. He nearly fell down because of that. Although he was usually a composed steward, at the moment, he couldn\u2019t help but twist his mouth and shiver\u2026\u201cWhat the hell\u2026 I have traveled extensively for 30 years and gone through fire and water for 18 years. Even so I have never seen anybody that narcissistic\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat a top wonder of the world!\u201d He spoke straight out.\u201cWhat top wonder of the world?\u201d Ye Xiao was opening the door and happened to hear that, so he asked.He knew that even though he had gotten the memory from the dead Ye Xiao, he still had much to learn about this mortal world. He wouldn\u2019t let go a chance to gain more information!\u201cHmm\u2026 Urh\u2026 Well\u2026\u201d The steward spoke slowly, \u201cMy lord, there were some supreme dan beads at the auction in the Ling-Bao Hall Salesroom. I was saying that those dan beads were truly a top wonder of the world.\u201d\u201cSupreme dan beads?\u201d Ye Xiao curled his lip and thought, \u201cSupreme dan bead he said. That\u2019s nothing. It is just something I used to earn some money, you fool.\u201d\u201cMy lord, I think it would better for you to stay at home these days.\u201d The steward said seriously, \u201cI have heard that the kingdom is extremely chaotic right now. All those martial sects including the mysterious ones and the noble clans are sending their core forces to the capital. The next few months in the capital will be filled with dangers\u2026\u201dHe looked at Ye Xiao and had an opinion that he dared not to voice, but spoke in his mind instead, \u201cA foppish young lord like you will easily be the target of their swords. Hmm, you are dead meat if you get into any trouble.\u201dIn the government and among the residents, people may be afraid of offending the General Ye, but those people who fought for living or came from some great sects or noble clans were fearless. They would easily kill anybody like crumpling a piece of paper\u2026\u201cHow can I just stay here? I am going out now\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao frowned.\u201cIt would be better if you don\u2019t.\u201d The steward also frowned and said impatiently.All the clans in the capital were recalling their fighters from the frontlines. All the young lords were forbidden to go out by their families. Every clan was preparing to receive these sects\u2026At this time, if Ye Xiao walked out on the street, he would be like a bright lamp in a dark tunnel \u2013 a vivid target.Ye Xiao signed, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I will keep myself inconspicuous\u2026\u201d He then pushed the door open and left.\u201cStay low, my lord.\u201d The steward spoke and thought, \u201cOh my lord\u2026 please don\u2019t get into any trouble\u2026\u201d\u201cAll right. Absolutely!\u201d Ye Xiao loudly replied as he had already moved far away.Both of them didn\u2019t know that Ye Xiao would neither keep away from trouble nor would he stay low, instead he was going to be the centerpiece of an earthshaking event!Ye Xiao was walking breezily on the streets. As he had the money now, he certainly was heading to the herbal medicine market. That was his most important goal at the moment.Above all, after having absorbed the blood ginseng into the sphere\u2019s space, he had great confidence in the use of herbal medicine for this space. He couldn\u2019t wait to get to the market.In Ye Xiao\u2019s opinion, no matter if it was in the Qing-Yun Realm or the mortal world, cultivation was always the top priority!He was trying to keep his promise, so he stayed low all along and showed no curiosity towards anything. In fact he had no mood for trouble.As he got closer to the herbal medicine market, he sniffed a dense smell of the herbal medicine.Ye Xiao\u2019s eyes lit up and he trotted over to the market with excitement.The market was on a street which was over six miles long and at least half of the stores in it were selling herbal medicine. The others were either clinics or stands that were selling medical equipment. Most of the people walking on this street were wearing fierce expressions.This street was the well-known Hui-Tian Street of the Chen-Xing City.In Hui-Tian Street, only herbs, medicine and medical equipments were sold.If you got hurt, got ill or got poisoned, you would either come here to find a cure or a doctor who could help you fight against death or you could simply die.Because if there was anything in this mortal world that could save you, it would be found in this Hui-Tian Street. If it wasn\u2019t for sale here, you were almost certainly going to die\u2026That was why this street was named the Hui-Tian Street. [1]Ye Xiao went in and out of one store after another. He had been spending money like running water to buy herbal medicines \u2013 and he had bought a lot. He wouldn\u2019t hesitate since he had 500 thousand silver bars at his disposal.Ye Xiao was satisfied since he had bought several hundreds of years old ginsengs and other hundreds of years old herbal medicines.But those had already cost Ye Xiao more than 150 thousand silver bars.Nobody had noticed that every time after he had bought something, he kept discarding the purchases after walking a short distance. Because once these herbal medicines came in touch with his hands, their essences would be completely absorbed by the sphere\u2019s space.These herbal medicines were far from superior treasures, but they had useful quantities of medicinal essence. They possessed quite a massive potency when gathered together.This time the space had just absorbed the most essential parts of them. Some of the herbal medicines had retained their appearances, but the essences within them were already absorbed completely. They had just become some useless shells\u2026Ye Xiao did everything covertly. He kept a few bags in his hands so that people around him would think that he had never let his purchases out of his sight.But they didn\u2019t know that these bags were replaced many times. And all the contents of the bags had become garbage.He travelled from north to south and then east to west. All the stores in the market thought that they finally had the chance to meet a heavy buyer that they had always been dreaming about.Nobody noticed that he was quietly throwing away everything he bought, spending his money like running water \u2013 this was quite a stealthy operation.When Ye Xiao was about to visit the last store, some guys walking toward the same store caught sight of him. Then one of them hurriedly moved to an alleyway to hide from Ye Xiao.This guy was actually Wang Xiao-Nian!His eyes were burning up with unquenchable hatred.He cursed in his mind,\u201cYe Xiao! You bloody son of a bxtch\uff01The god must hate you so he gave me this opportunity! Your retribution is coming.\u201dBeside him was a silk-robed youth who was followed by a small entourage. This youth was confused by Wang Xiao-Nian\u2019s reaction, so he curiously asked, \u201cWho is he?\u201d\u201cHe is Ye Xiao!\u201d Wang Xiao-Nian said, while gnashing his teeth.\u201cThat guy is Ye Xiao?\u201d The silk-robed youth was about twenty-seven or twenty-eight, with a roman nose, fiery eyes and a strapping body. He frowned, \u201cThe blood ginseng that I gave your father as a gift, was extorted by him, right?\u201dThis youth had slightly overdone the deepness of his voice, creating a heavy tone that made people who heard his voice feel depressed.Wang Xiao-Nian took a deep breath, \u201cThat is him! It was this bloody foppish black sheep that bullied and extorted us, while relying on the name of his father!\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 It really is a small world. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d The silk-robed man had a murderous look in his eyes that was emanating a thick killing intent, \u201cQuick, go away and hide yourself somewhere! Make sure no one can connect you with what\u2019s going to happen!\u201dHe spoke slowly, \u201cA gift from me is never something that can be robbed so easily. He who dares to rob me, must prepare to pay the price!\u201dWang Xiao-Nian was delighted, \u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201dWang Xiao-Nian was clear about who this man was.That\u2019s why he was so delighted!The name of this silk-robed man was Mu Cheng-Bai. He was the elder brother-in-law of the crown prince and he was from one of the well-known eight noble clans \u2013 the Mu clan.He had lived in the capital all his life. Even though he did not hold any official position, nobody dared to mess with him.Because he represented an extremely powerful force!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe main reason the crown prince could have been crowned, was because of the support he received from this great noble clan.Mu Cheng-Bai had played an important role in choosing the next crown prince.A man like him wanted to assault Ye Xiao. It seemed that Ye Xiao would not find it easy to get away this time!\u2026\u2026[1] Hui-Tian Street: Hui-Tian is \u56de\u5929 in Chinese.

Watch me!!Ye Xiao had nearly finished his shopping tour. He had just walked into the last store and was immediately attracted by a fluctuation in the surrounding qi, before he could even utter a word.He quickly follow the fluctuation of special qi and found out that it had originated from inside a dusty box sitting in a remote corner of the store.\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Ye Xiao asked as he pointed at the box, before nonchalantly picking it up.\u201cHmm\u2026 I have no idea. Well, to be honest, even our manager has no idea as to what it is. It may be just some weird weed, nothing of value really. The only strange thing about it is that it never withers. Although it has been in the box for a few years, it is still vividly green. Maybe it is useful in some way\u2026 But none of our staff really know\u2026\u201d The sales clerk answered honestly.Normally when a customer would ask about a specific good, they would be told that they had sharp eyes and that they had spotted a treasure, in an attempt to make a greater profit.But since the sales clerk was working in a store here for some time, he had developed a keen eye. He instantly guessed Ye Xiao\u2019s status from the way he was dressed and how he acted, so he didn\u2019t talk tall but decided to tell the truth instead. He knew it would be better losing the deal than getting into some trouble afterwards!The guy understood it clearly: A man like Ye Xiao could not be mentioned in the same sentence as some fools that he could casually mess around with.\u201cHmm? Since it is useless, why do you keep it?\u201d Ye Xiao displayed calmness as he asked further questions while holding the box.\u201cWe had collected it several years ago\u2026 Well I have forgotten the details. Anyway, we haven\u2019t been able to sell it, so we just keep it in the corner.\u201d The salesclerk showed embarrassment and rubbed his head.Ye Xiao nodded, and then spoke carelessly, \u201cI will take it. Give me the price.\u201dHe actually felt extreme happiness in his heart.He was thinking, \u201cWhat \u2018may be just some weird weeds\u2019? What \u2018isn\u2019t something valuable\u2019 and \u2018always stays green\u2019, you fool? How hilarious! It is the Heaven\u2019s Cyan!\u201dFrom a straw to a tree, it takes ten thousand years; to cook it into tea, he who drinks it could be led to heavens! <>The seedling of the Heaven\u2019s Cyan grows by one inch every five hundred years. It takes ten thousand years to fully grow its roots and become a tree. In the last day of the ten thousand year period, the tree will grow rapidly from twenty inch sapling to a tree approximately a foot in diameter. After that it goes back to growing one inch per five hundred years again\u2026Ten thousand years are only enough for it to grow one full cycle.It needs neither sunshine nor water, nor trials of winds and thunders. Seasons never influence it. It only needs a private space to automatically absorb the qi from the world which is present in the air.There weren\u2019t many people that knew about the Heaven\u2019s Cyan, yet Ye Xiao happened to know clearly about it. And he also knew the name of it when it had blossomed.The Tree of the Cultivating Tea!People at any cultivating level, even those at the top level of the Grade of Daoyuan like Ye Xiao was in his previous life, could boost their cultivating process with the Cultivating TeaNow in Ye Xiao\u2019s discerning eyes, the Heaven\u2019s Cyan in the box was over nine thousand years old. It needed only a short time to become a Tree of Cultivating Tea.How could he not be astounded when he saw such a treasure?It was a super valuable treasure that could hardly be found anywhere. In the Qing-Yun Realm, a pot of the Cultivating Tea was worth at least 100 thousand Golden Crystals! [1] The cost of an actual Tree of Cultivating Tea would be utterly inconceivable\uff01After the Heaven\u2019s Cyan transformed into the Tree of Cultivating Tea, it acquired the appearance of a normal tea tree that wouldn\u2019t draw any eyes. One would be very lucky to be able to come across one and recognize it. So the best way to find the tree was to find it when it was still in its infancy and could be recognised with its always-green feature.However, even if somebody found it, it would still require an entire ten thousand years to complete a single cycle of growth and obtaining the tea leaves.Who on earth could live for ten thousand years?So the Tree of Cultivating Tea was very rare, even in the Qing-Yun Realm.Ye Xiao had been extreme lucky to see a five thousand years old Heaven\u2019s Cyan, so he knew about this \u2018weird weed\u2019.He really couldn\u2019t have imagined there was really an almost blossomed Heaven\u2019s Cyan in this low-grade mortal world where it was quietly soaking in qi!Wasn\u2019t it the pie in the sky?\u201cYou\u2026 You will take it?\u201d The salesclerk blinked his eyes and felt that it was hard to comprehend why someone would like to buy such a weed, so he asked, \u201cWell\u2026 It really isn\u2019t priced yet\u2026 Do you really want it?\u201d\u201cHow on earth would I know its worth?\u201d The sales clerk thought.Ye Xiao casually took out a note worth 5 silver bars, \u201cHow about this? Is it enough for you?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 Yes\u2026\u201d The salesclerk was delighted. A weed for 5 silver bars, he felt like this was a small fortune for some weed.Meanwhile, a slow and heavy voice sounded instantly, \u201cI will take it, for 50 silver bars.\u201dA silk-robed man walked into the store with his hands clasped behind his back. It was Mu Chen-Bai!The salesclerk was stunned hearing his words. \u201cA weed, which has been here for three years and nobody ever asked about it, now suddenly two customers want it and they are even raising the price!\u201d\u201cI am the one who saw it first.\u201d Ye Xiao frowned and felt something was wrong. He thought, \u201cThis guy comes with strong hostility! But I barely know him. Who is he?\u201d\u201cWell you just offer your price. Since the deal is still uncertain, whoever gives the higher price surely gets it.\u201d Mu Cheng-Bai said chillily.In fact, Mu Cheng-Bai had no idea about the contents inside the box. But that didn\u2019t matter to him, he just did this to displease Ye Xiao.\u201cThe higher price you said? 500 silver bars then.\u201d Ye Xiao curled his mouth and a cold light shone in his eyes.\u201c5 thousand.\u201d Mu Cheng-Bai held his arms behind his back and looked up.\u201c50 thousand.\u201d Ye Xiao narrowed his eyes.If someone who had known Ye Xiao well was present, he would have recognised that Ye Xiao was actually livid.\u201c500 thousand then!\u201d Mu Cheng-Bai moved his neck and smiled disdainful. He was here to provoke Ye Xiao, so he would do anything necessary. No matter what price Ye Xiao would say, he would follow it by ten times as much.He thought that in the capital there was no one really dared to ask for his money anyway. He doesn\u2019t care what price he needed to offer, because the sales clerk would not really get his money.However, right after he spoke out his words, he felt his belly deform into a concave shape and experienced a sharp pain. WHOOSH! The next moment he flew away and a voice sounded in his ear, \u201cFxxk your five! Hundred! Thousand!!\u201dYe Xiao was really pissed and became violent. He thought, \u201cBastard how dare you mess with me, the Xiao Monarch?\u201dHe had no hesitation as he had viciously kicked Mu Cheng Bai in his stomach. This kick contained such force that Mu Cheng-Bai was kicked out of the door!He crashed through the portiere and flew out far into the street.What a spiffy kick!One moment he was still talking and in the very next moment, he suffered a crushing defeat!PUFF! Mu Cheng-Bai forcefully fell on the street, and coincidentally landed on a big basket of persimmons. Yellow pulps were now covering his body. But he couldn\u2019t stop and rolled over causing the pulps to get into his mouth. His mouth was now stained with yellow pulp and people might now think that he was getting off that big basket as he finished eating those persimmons\u2026Mu Cheng-Bai was quite a cultivator himself but he hadn\u2019t thought that this girly foppish lord could actually surprise him with a kick. He got kicked completely unprepared. This \u2018flight\u2019 had made him really embarrassed.His guards were also stunned and were unable to take any action. In the blink of an eye that they saw their master flying out like a rocket.They were just going to hit Ye Xiao angrily, but unexpectedly, Ye Xiao was the one who had rushed out through the door, now completely furious.And then the angry words boomed outside the store in succession.\u201cYou dare! I will let you have it! You want to take it from me, huh? You actually\u2026 You actually\u2026 You prick\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao swore loudly. And Bam! Puff! Slap! He didn\u2019t let up with the beating even while swearing.A moment before, he was thinking, \u201cThis prick clearly came to me to pick a fight. Then he must be either with Wang Da-Nian or the Crown Prince\u2019s Palace. Or he is just some moron! Whoever he is, I am going to beat him up today! So what if he is a big shot?!\u201dThen he kicked the man again before grabbing the box. He rushed in to leave the 5 silver bars note on the desk as payment for the weed. Then he got out on the street and stepped on the belly of Mu Cheng-Bai, and then he rained punches on him like raindrops in a storm.The first punch made Mu Cheng-Bai\u2019s left eye black and the second one, the other. He just created a panda then the panda\u2019s nose became red, and then his mouth turned black too\u2026As the young generation of the eight noble clans, Mu Cheng-Bai was a cultivator of the Grade of Renyuan, although he was doing better in literature than martial arts. But he had no ability to react when Ye Xiao had kicked him. The primary qi in his dantian had dispersed due to it. Then he was lying on the floor in disgrace and failed to get up. He could offer no resistance at that moment.After that, before he realized anything, Ye Xiao had already ridden on him like riding a horse and punched him with the two fists like a jackhammer!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Mu Cheng-Bai was only able to speak out one word before his mouth was punched by Ye Xiao. What he wanted to say was punched back into his throat.\u201cMe? What about me! You asked for this you bastard!\u201d Lord Ye was high-spirited and vigorous at the moment. He was showing his rascal specialty of \u2018the three lords\u2019 right in the crowded street.He represented the saying vividly\u2013 When reasoning didn\u2019t work, actions of a scamp really helped\u2026\u2014\u2014\u2013[1] Golden Crystal: The money in the Qing-Yun Realm.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I will kill you!People on the street started gossiping. A crowd had gathered around the fighters and were talking about the fight. Ye Xiao had been quite quickly identified as the foppish lord by some and they quickly disclosed his identity to those near them. After a while, everyone had learnt about Ye Xiao and they kept on spicing up the gossip.\u201cWhoop! I had thought that I knew who that is. It turns out to be the young lord Ye, the General Ye\u2019s son.\u201d\u201cNo wonder he acts brutally. He just rode the man and didn\u2019t stop punching.\u201d\u201cHe is Ye Xiao. You know, the young lord. For him this is so ordinary, just like any other day, like a routine\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. It would be very uncommon, very strange, and very unearthly that he doesn\u2019t beat someone\u2026 But who is that punching bag?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I have no idea. This must be his unlucky day\u2026\u201dFinally, the two guards of Mu Cheng-Bai arrived on the scene with furious howls. They burst in through the crowd and launched their fists towards Ye Xiao. Ye Xiao calmly looked over his shoulders for a bit and stood up without any particular hurry. He then firmly stamped his foot and leapt up in the air. He turned his waist in the air and a large snap of breaking bones was heard when his right foot connected with one of the two guards.Aaahhhhh! A scream of misery was heard from the mouth of the guard who had been ruthlessly kicked.Whether Ye Xiao did it on purpose or not, when his foot landed on the ground, he managed to stamp it right on Mu Cheng-Bai\u2019s crotch.The piteous cries of Mu Cheng Bai were world-shaking and one could imagine how painful it would be to get kicked in the crotch!Mu Cheng-Bai curled his body while holding his crotch like a prawn. Tears were rolling out of his eyes, snot was dripping out of his nose and a look of extreme pain was clearly visible on his twisted face.On the other side, Ye Xiao and the two guards had already begun fighting.There were many expert cultivators in the clan of Mu. No one would doubt that. But Mu Cheng-Bai had been a tyrant in the capital for many years, so he wouldn\u2019t need to use any martial force to solve problems.And for this reason, he had only brought two guards with him who were only good at bootlicking. And while they were at the Grade of Renyuan, they were still at a lower level than Mu Cheng-Bai. He had planned to just hang around on the street, so he had anticipated that he wouldn\u2019t need any heavy protection. Besides, the three of them were all at the Grade of Renyuan. That was enough for any common situations\u2026But he didn\u2019t know he would come across Ye Xiao \u2013 an unreasonable foppish young lord with ridiculous strength!Due to this miscalculation, Mu Cheng-Bai took a real beating this time.However, Ye Xiao was not aware of all these details. He was simply wondering why the guards were so lame, though they looked like some expert cultivators \u2013 steady steps, sharp eyes and strong bodies.\u201cWhat is going on? Why are they so\u2026 weak?\u201dWhile Ye Xiao\u2019s curiosity was piqued, he suddenly heard an exhausted scream from behind him, \u201cGo get him! Beat him up! If he dies, I will take the blame!\u201dThe voice was no longer calm and deep. Instead it was utterly abashed.Mu Cheng-Bai was the young generation of the well-known clan of Mu. Although he was not a direct descendant, he had never suffered through any difficulties. In the Kingdom of Chen, he was the older cousin of the crown prince, so he always got what he wanted. A powerful clan was behind him. Who would dare to mess with him?How could he bare to suffer such disgrace?Today Ye Xiao had beaten him as easily as a father would beat his son. Even though he was usually shrewd, at this moment an immense rage had taken over his rationality.Even more so, knowing that Ye Xiao was a foppish fool, had increased his feeling of humiliation. \u201cWhen eventually the news of today\u2019s event spreads throughout the capital\u2026 The whole kingdom will come to know that I, the famous young lord Mu, had got beaten by one of the three foppish lords, Ye Xiao \u2026 How can I live through the shame which comes from this?!\u201dWhen the order was given, the guards instantly turned ferocious.Honestly, they too were very upset about what had just happened. In their eyes Ye Xiao was just a fool with impractical steps, some useless punches and no spunk, but they just couldn\u2019t seem to touch him. In fact, these two experienced guards were pushed towards the limits of their abilities time and time again!They were feeling exceedingly gloomy.However, now that they had received the order form their master, they would naturally go to any lengths to beat Ye Xiao up.Shiiiing! They both quickly drew their swords, which gave of a resplendent reflections, showing their beauty, in the sun. They then quickly aimed their swords and swung at Ye Xiao.The first sword was aimed at Ye Xiao\u2019s throat after it had deceptively changed its direction thrice! Meanwhile, the other sword was aimed at Ye Xiao\u2019s waist to make sure that dodging was not an option for this foppish lord!The two swords were in unison as they slashed towards Ye Xiao. They really didn\u2019t care that Ye Xiao was from the General\u2019s House. They just wanted to chop this foppish lord apart!In the eyes of the Mu clan members, to kill the son of a mere general in a kingdom of the mortal world was just a casual monday morning.His status meant absolutely nothing to them!They had gotten the order, but even if no one would have ordered them to kill this foppish lord it wouldn\u2019t have changed a thing. Killing someone just didn\u2019t mean anything to them, with the backing of the royal forces, they would always be in the right!Meanwhile, at a corner of the street, Wang Xiao Nian was still hiding. If one would look at him closely, they would see beads of sweat rolling down his forehead as an immense fear was plastered on his face! \u201cWTF! You aren\u2019t seriously going to chop him apart, are you?!\u201d He panicked, \u201cI\u2026 I\u2026 I couldn\u2019t take the guilt.\u201d\u2026A cold light flashed in Ye Xiao\u2019s eyes.\u201cIn this crowded market place, there are too many onlookers. Many of them have actually surrounded us to enjoy the show. Those three can ignore all this because they have the royal force behind them, but\u2026 I can\u2019t.\u201d He thought, \u201cBut I really want to kill them\u2026\u201dAs he was pondering over this issue, he suddenly made his move. He flexibly turned his waist and slipped away like a fish in the ocean. He then started to loudly scream, \u201cMURDER!!! HELP!!!\u201d as he quickly ran away!Ye Xiao ran away with tottering steps, all the while acting like he was scared. At this point he wasn\u2019t interested the slightest about something as trivial as embarrassment. He reached the first corner in the street and quickly darted into it, disappearing in the blink of an eye.It seemed like he was too scared to tell right from left as he took the wrong turn and ran westwards even though the General\u2019s House was to the east.He had chosen to run in the opposite direction from his house and was getting further and further away from this safe haven\u2026\u201cYou two are truly useless! Go get him! Go!\u201d Mu Cheng-Bai furiously repeated his command.While he had finally managed to stand up, his hands were still tightly enveloping his crotch area as the pain had not subsided by the slightest amount. The muscles in his face were twitching heavily and he was gasping for air.He really had suffered a huge loss of face and he was determined to catch Ye Xiao no matter what!He had never been humiliated like this in public before.The guards were also infuriated by this foppish lord, so they rushed after Ye Xiao without further ado.Mu Cheng-Bai was so resentful, that he beared with the pain smouldering in his crotch, and followed after his two guards.Within a space of a few seconds, all the action had disappeared, both the assailant and the assaulted had ran off and the spectators were left speechlessly looking at each other.Only after a while did the spectators regain their wits and quickly started chatting, \u201cHe truly is one of those \u2018three foppish lords\u2019\u2026 Fighting on the street in front of the public, he did it like it was for his glory\u2026\u201d\u201cThat man who was beaten up didn\u2019t seem like a good guy either. He actually wanted to kill someone in the middle of the street in broad daylight.\u201d\u201cHe wasn\u2019t just thinking it, he was actually going for it. If the lord Ye didn\u2019t run fast enough, he would already have been chopped into many pieces\u2026\u201d\u201cI have seen enough for a year. The world of these lords is really something beyond our comprehension\u2026\u201d\u2026Wang Xiao-Nian had joined the crowd to look at the spectacle with a foxy smile on his face.He thought disdainfully, \u201cHumph, Ye Xiao. You have neither realised the trouble you have put yourself in nor the person you\u2019re messing with, but all in all, you are definitely dead meat now! Even if your father came back, he wouldn\u2019t be able to save you! For these men, killing you means nothing at all!\u201dShowing a sinister smile, he turned around and quietly left.He was definitely not going to follow these four men and watch the slaughter of Ye Xiao. Firstly, he simply wasn\u2019t able to do so and secondly, he didn\u2019t want to get involved in Ye Xiao\u2019s murder\u2026The General Ye might not be able to deal with Mu Cheng-Bai, but he certainly could deal with Wang Xiao-Nian.Therefore, although Wang Xiao-Nian was happy in his heart, he wouldn\u2019t dare say anything.He was already worrying about how he would confirm that Mu Cheng Bai wouldn\u2019t mention his involvement in this ordeal.\u2026.Ye Xiao went along the streets and alleys. It looked like he was fleeing through any path he could find. In fact, he was choosing these routes on purpose. The surroundings got more and more dilapidated as he ran further and further. Ahead of him there was the city slum.All he could see were ruins.Beyond the ruins in the city slum there was a rather large hill. After one went over the hill they would arrive in a forest and on the far side of the forest there was a lake.These were created by mankind in the Chen-Xing City \u2013 \u2018a hill, a forest and a lake\u2019.The three men were chasing after him!They showed an attitude like \u2018we will chase you up to the highest point in heaven and down to the lowest level of hell\u2019!But what they didn\u2019t know, was that the closer they got to Ye Xiao, the closer they got to their own death!Ye Xiao was slowly building up his killing killing intent as he ran!\u2026Ye Xiao knew that the guy he had just beaten up, must be someone special. He might not have recognized the guy, but his guts told him that he shouldn\u2019t act rashly against him. He wasn\u2019t interested in looking for useless trouble, so even though he had punched mercilessly, he had never had the intented to kill him.But Mu Cheng-Bai definitely wanted to kill him!The two guards had already made a killing move!Usually Ye Xiao would exterminate his enemies; Especially those who tried to kill him.\u2018You want to kill me? I will kill you!\u2019That\u2019s why he had chosen such a complicated route \u2013 he had wanted to draw them to this isolated place.Ye Xiao had pretended to be extremely exhausted for a while. He had arrived at the top of the hill while breathing heavily. It looked like he was about to fall down at any moment. The three men felt their desire to kill this foppish lord rise to an even higher level!\u201cBastard, you finally have nowhere to go!\u201d\u201cWe can even kill you in the middle of a busy street and now you brought us in such a desolate place? How could we not dare to kill you? Bastard! You really made a mistake in coming this way! This is your way to the hell!\u201dYe Xiao ran off the hill and looked around. He happily noticed that those three were right and that there were indeed no signs of people anywhere near him. \u201cThis really is a perfect place to get rid of their bodies without anyone noticing\u2026\u201d He thought.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euDusk had settled in by the time Ye Xiao arrived at this desolate place!Ye Xiao finally stopped with the totter and suddenly increased his speed, he was like an arrow, shooting through the air. Whoosh! The leaves on the trees shook as he rushed into the forest!The two guards followed Ye Xiao with great urgency. However, as they enter deeper into the forest, uneasiness slowly crept inside their hearts. They felt something was wrong and when they looked in the direction where Ye Xia run off to, they were instantly stunned.The foppish lord, who had seemed like a stray cur, was now standing in front of them with a calm and composed demeanor. He looked completely at ease and that fact made them uneasy!Ye Xiao was standing there with both his hands clasped behind his back. He disdainfully smiled and calmly looked at the approaching guards. He deviously nodded his head and said with a chilling smile, \u201cWell done guys. You have fulfilled your responsibilities and you have obediently chased me all the way here on your master\u2019s command. However\u2026 The road of life is long and boring. You burn in the sun and freeze in the snow. You have to overcome the bumps and survive the thorns of the brambles. To Live like the two of you is true suffering.

However, they felt extremely pressured under Ye Xiao\u2019s unyielding gaze! They wanted to curse and scream, yet under this pressure, their voices never managed to leave their throats!To them, Ye Xiao seemed to be a god from the heavens. They felt that he was invincible!After a prolonged period of silence, they finally caved in and shouted out in panic,\u201dYe Xiao you fool! You dare to speak with such arrogance while standing on death\u2019s doorstep!\u201dYe Xiao nodded and smiled gently, \u201cWell. Well. Then could you please send me to my death?\u201dMeanwhile, a completely out of breath Mu Cheng-Bai finally managed to catch up with these three. His eyes turned red out of anger when he caught the sight of Ye Xiao, and he yelled his orders to the guards, \u201cWhat in the bloody hell are you waiting for? Go kill him!\u201dThe guards could no longer stand the stress from this stand off and now they, having received the order from their master, decided to take the initiative. If they didn\u2019t make any actions soon, they would certainly go insane. Therefore, they shouted in unison and swung their bright steel swords!Ye Xiao laughed, casually stepped forward while facing the swords and said, \u201cNever speak of the hardships in life. It doesn\u2019t take a thousand bottles of wine to relieve your sorrow. It is your destiny that we have met in this narrow path. With my laughter you will be sent to your death.\u201dThe swords had started to emit flashy rays of sword lights after being infused with the guards qi.The guards had obviously gone all out with these attacks as they had felt a life-and-death crisis originating from Ye Xiao\u2019s smile. Every inch of his smile gave them an ominous sense of death!But even after going all out, they continued to feel intimidated!Ye Xiao slightly spun around while smiling, and just barely managed to slip away from the two attacking swords. Whoops!One of his fair and delicate hands hit the wrist of a guard!His actions had seemed so slow that even an ordinary person would have been able to follow the movement of his arm as he attacked.However, the guard remained absolutely powerless to defend against it!While the guard was screaming and let go of his sword, which shone brightly as it continued on its path.It almost managed to slash Ye Xiao\u2019s hand!Ye Xiao used one hand to stop the blade and tossed it to his other hand and he used this newly acquired weapon to attack the guards. A sword light burst out causing the sword slash to look like a galaxy of stars in the night sky.He looked like a master calligrapher with a hand folded behind his back and gripping a brush pen with the other hand to write on a snow white paper.It was both elegant and enjoyable.The sword flashed and all observers would only see a streak of light illuminating the path travelled by the sword! But the two guards who were fighting against it showed horror-struck looks!Moreover, they felt admiration towards a foe who was skilled to such a degree!They worshipped his talent deep within their hearts.It felt like a paramount god from the heavens was smiting them! The slashing sword seemed to represent the will of heaven and hell!It was inviolable and overwhelming!They felt like that it was their destiny to die under this sword!While the sword lights were quickly losing their splendor, blood sprayed out of the guards and painted the sky, trees and ground red.The murderous looks that had been on the guards\u2019 faces had been replaced by the fearful looks \u2013 like they had desecrated a god. Then they slowly fell down on the floor.PUFF! When their bodies hit the ground, a small cloud of dust to rose from the ground.\u2026The swordplay that Ye Xiao was using was The Monarch\u2019s Sword that he depended on to rule the Qing-Yun Realm!The Monarch holds the sword and he takes away all lives! Thousands of dead bodies fall. Beacons are lit for millions of miles! The sword of the Monarch kills with absolute certainty. It rarely shows up but it will kill when it does!There was no one who had survived after facing The Monarch\u2019s Sword.\u2026A single sword strike had actually caused two instantaneous deaths!Mu Cheng-Bai\u2019s eyes were wide open as he was utterly shocked. He looked at Ye Xiao and felt that his heart had suddenly stopped beating!At this moment, he wasn\u2019t thinking of slipping away, nor was he feeling frightened! He felt endless astonishment and bursting rage!\u201cDidn\u2019t Wang Xiao-Nian say\u2026 that this Ye Xiao was just a foppish idiot and was even too weak to hold a chicken? How come\u2026 he possesses such superior martial skills? He actually easily killed my two guards, who were both at the Grade of Renyuan, with one strike of his sword! How could a foppish idiot ever do this? Are you kidding me? Wang Xiao-Nian you are trying to get me killed, aren\u2019t you?\u201d A lot of thoughts kept spinning inside Mu Cheng-Bai\u2019s head.At this moment, the thing he wanted to do most was to find Wang Xiao-Nian and rip him to shreds! Though he was convinced that even by doing that, his anger wouldn\u2019t be relieved!Ye Xiao held the sword with only two fingers and casually looked at a drop of blood dripping down along the edge of the blade. He then looked straight at Mu Cheng-Bai and spoke, \u201cYou\u2019ve had a rough day.\u201dMu Cheng-Bai started panting and felt a chilling coldness in his heart. He couldn\u2019t even utter a single word.Ye Xiao shook his head and sighed, \u201cThis\u2026This is my first time killing in this life.\u201dHe stopped and slowly shook his head before continuing, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect the first time would come this soon.\u201dMu Cheng-Bai said hoarsely, \u201cSoon?\u201dYe Xiao smiled and explained patiently, \u201cYes, you are right. I didn\u2019t expect that I would start this kind of life again this soon\u2026\u201d One could see an extreme yearning and desire being born deep within his eyes.Mu Cheng-Bai felt a deep sense of fear when he saw the yearning and desire in Ye Xiao\u2019s eyes.Ye Xiao smiled and spoke gently, \u201cYou must be exhausted after chasing me all this way, but isn\u2019t living as long as you have done much more exhausting?\u201dMu Cheng-Bai\u2019s legs started trembling. He took a deep breath and said, \u201cYe Xiao! I know you don\u2019t have the guts to kill me!\u201dYe Xiao spoke with half-closed eyes, \u201cYou mean you have distinguished blood?\u201dThen he followed, \u201cOr special status?\u201dHe didn\u2019t stop, \u201cOr powerful backgrounds?\u201dAt last he said, \u201cNone of that will work on me.\u201d He pointed at the sharp and bloodstained blade, \u201cand neither on this.\u201dMu Cheng-Bai gnashed his teeth, \u201cI am from the Mu clan! I am Mu Cheng-Bai! I am Mu Cheng-Bai\u2026\u201dYe Xiao moved his ear forward, \u201cNever heard of them.\u201d He held the sword and stepped forward.\u201cI am the brother-in-law of the crown prince! I am the older brother of his wife!\u201d Mu Cheng-Bai was sweating. As Ye Xiao stepped closer to him, he couldn\u2019t help but step back and say, \u201cIf you kill me, the Ye clan will suffer repercussion for your actions. But if you let me go today, I promise you, Ye Xiao, I will make you rich and powerful in the government!\u201dYe Xiao straightened his back and said after thinking, \u201cDid you know me before today?\u201d\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d Mu Cheng-Bai shook his head and answered, \u201cWe have nothing against each other. You can\u2019t just kill me.\u201d\u201cNothing?\u201d Ye Xiao frowned, \u201cThen\u2026 what did you do all this for?\u201dHe was truly confused about this.\u201cWang Xiao-Nian! It was Wang Xiao-Nian!\u201d Mu Cheng-Bai nearly shouted out, \u201cThat bastard, he\u2026 he\u2026 He was angry because you had robbed something from him. He asked to come along with me today and happened to see you there\u2026 So he encouraged me\u2026 Then I\u2026 I\u2026\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao narrated, \u201cIt was Wang Xiao-Nian\u2026 Hmm, so you went after me? You bullied me and then tried to kill me\u2026 Right?\u201dMu Cheng-Bai was scared to death, \u201cNO! NO! NO! Noooo\u2026\u201dYe Xiao ignored him and said softly, \u201cSeveral days ago, I got poisoned\u2026 You know of it, don\u2019t you?\u201dMu Cheng-Bai was confused, \u201cPoison? No please\u2026 It wasn\u2019t me.\u201dYe Xiao looked right into his eyes and frowned, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t you? You know nothing?\u201dIf the brother-in-law of the crown prince didn\u2019t know\u2026 Then who did it? Wang Da-Nian was surely a suspect and he was with the crown prince\u2026 But now Mu Cheng-Bai said that he didn\u2019t know anything about it\u2026This case was getting extremely complicated and confusing.\u201cI don\u2019t know. Please. It truly wasn\u2019t me\u2026\u201dMu Cheng-Bai was willing to take out his fresh heart to show his honesty.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t you\u2026 and you know nothing\u2026 then what should I keep you alive for\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao frowned.\u201cI am useful! Please! I truly am\u2026 Lord Ye, listen to me please\u2026 I\u2026 I can help you in anyway\u2026 The government businesses, the wealth, the martial world\u2026\u201d At the moment, if there were pills for regret, Mu Cheng-Bai would spend every penny he had to buy them all. But there was no such thing in existence.He now had to beg for his life, and had started promising one beautiful thing after the other.Ye Xiao was too vicious at that moment! He was making Mu Cheng-Bai feel so stressed that he felt unable to control his bowels \u2013 he was almost certainly going to suffer from incontinence.\u201cIf I can get through this alive, I swear I will figure out ten thousand ways to torture Ye Xiao and and that father of his, Ye Nan-Tian, to death!\u201dMu Cheng-Bai was already planning his revenge, but even so, he kept on making promises to Ye Xiao in hopes to get him to change his mind. He was hoping that Ye Xiao would let him go.But he also knew that his chance of survival was truly too small\u2026If Ye Xiao hadn\u2019t kill the guards, he might have considered sparing Mu Cheng-Bai. But since he had already killed the guards, he couldn\u2019t stop anymore.Ye Xiao sighed, \u201cI really want to trust you, but\u2026 I can\u2019t. I know that if I let you go, it will bring me unending troubles. You are begging. That\u2019s true. But I can also feel that you\u2019ve already started planning your revenge\u2026 People like you, they are always standing high and never get humiliated. What happened today must have already created a seedling of burning shame deep inside your heart. If I were to let you go, your revenge would arrive at my doorsteps shortly, right?\u201dMu Cheng-Bai shook his head fearfully, \u201cNo! No\u2026 Absolutely not\u2026 You must trust me. Please, trust me\u2026\u201dYe Xiao was nonchalant, \u201cBesides, I always do things cleanly\u2026 In many situations, things will just change when I speak one word extra\u2026\u201d\u201cAhhh\u2026 Ahhh\u2026\u201d Mu Cheng-Bai gasped weirdly and strange sounds were coming out of his throat, even he didn\u2019t know why. His eyes turned wider and wider in fear as he stared at Ye Xiao. Then he suddenly screamed and started running away, as if the devil himself was chasing after him.Ye Xiao\u2019s eyes flashed as he slightly flicked his wrist. The steel sword flew out of his hand straight for Mu Cheng-Bai. PUFF! It managed to penetrate his back and quickly cut through his heart!Mu Cheng-Bai\u2019s body still ran for several steps before falling down.His eyes were inanimate but still seemed to be looking forward. There was no hate in his eyes, only fear and regret.He had messed with the wrong guy.\u201cThe brother-in-law of the crown prince?\u201d Ye Xiao looked down at the dead body and shook his head, \u201cHow can a dead man be the brother-in-law to anybody\u2026 Dead men are sharing the same title\u2026 Dead bodies.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will avenge you.\u201d Ye Xiao stared at the body, \u201cI will punish Wang Xiao-Nian soon enough.\u201dAfter saying these words, he walked away steadily and did not spare a second look. He made his way out of the forest while stepping on the fallen leaves.A calm man could be seen walking casually out of this forest, as if he had just enjoyed the sunset followed by the appearance of the moon and the stars.From start to finish, not a single drop of blood nor a single speck of dust had stained his clothes.Three bodies remained on the forest floor, silently waiting to be devoured by the hungry wildlife.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He had predicted that Ye Xiao would definitely die this time.\u201cHumph! How dare you extort me! I just played a little trick and now you\u2019re dead meat!\u201dWang Xiao-Nian was skipping away in a completely happy mood. Wang Da-Nian noticed that his son was unusually buoyant and felt dumfounded. He kept on pestering his son about his improved mood, but Wang Xiao-Nian remained tight lipped.Wang Xiao-Nian knew the seriousness of this event. If Ye Xiao had truly died\u2026 the Northern General would definitely create a massive tempest!He knew that it would be in his best interest to remain silent for now!He had restlessly spent the next two days anticipating the arrival of this good news. He had frequently daydreamed about the sorry figure of Ye Xiao\u2019s dead bodyand whether Ye Xiao had figured out the culprit responsible for his demise.Hmm\u2026Another day had passed, and Wang Xiao-Nian was still waiting for the news\u2026And the news finally came.A messenger had arrived from the crown Prince\u2019s Palace, \u201cSupervisor Wang. The crown prince sends for your son. There are some questions for him.\u201dWang Da-Nian felt flattered that the crown prince had actually sent for his son. He thought, \u201cThis\u2026 this must be the start of my son\u2019s bright future.\u201d\u201cGo. Speak well.\u201d Wang Da-Nian urged his son, \u201cThis is your best chance. Do keep that in mind.\u201dWang Xiao-Nian looked confused. He was thinking, \u201cWhy is it the crown prince who is contacting me? Why is it not Mu Cheng-Bai? What? Something doesn\u2019t feel right\u2026\u201d\u2026On the other side of the city, after killing Mu Cheng-Bai and his two guards, Ye Xiao had stayed at home for three days!He was not trying to cover the murders nor was he afraid that people would figure it out.When he had finally arrived back at home that day, he immediately jumped into the sphere. He had spend 350 thousand silver bars on treasures, so he couldn\u2019t wait to see the amount of qi that would fill the space inside the sphere!Ye Xiao was truly unable to contain himself..However, when he finally got into the space, he was stunned by what he saw.The amount of qi in the space had actually remained the same and its color showed no changes.Well, there was a tiny difference \u2013 which was the appearance of a small amount of fog-like qi. That was all.Ye Xiao took in a lungfull of the unchanged qi in the space and was rendered totally speechless.\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be! The space totally changed by just absorbing one blood ginseng\u2026 Today it has absorbed a great amount of qi from all those herbal medicines. It may not be enough to expect an improvement in the quality, but there should at least be a change in quantity. How come nothing has changed at all?\u201dHe was totally bewildered by what he saw!It was true that it shouldn\u2019t be like this. But what could have gone wrong?Blink! Ye Xiao suddenly thought of something and rushed to the egg. Once he arrived and saw the egg, he turned furious.He had found out the reason for his confusion.Endless white qi was flowing into the egg like a rapid river and it was slowly growing bigger.Ye Xiao was not only angry, but also shocked.He saw that the egg was blowing up like a balloon. It was getting bigger and had increased its size from that of a goose egg to that of a small melon. Then it finally stopped growing, but still continued to absorb all the qi that was flowing inside this space.The egg\u2019s need for the qi wasn\u2019t limited by its size.Although the egg had stopped growing, its dim surface was getting brighter and brighter. It could be seen indistinctly that some mystical patterns were appearing on its surface.\u201cDamn it!\u201d Ye Xiao couldn\u2019t help cursing.\u201cI spent 350 thousands and got through such a rough day and all I got for my troubles is some food for this god damn egg! This greedy bastard has left nothing for me! And\u2026 And it actually stopped growing! That is simply a waste of my bloody energy and money!\u201d Just a short while ago, he was fantasizing about the huge improvement of his cultivation level, but now he was really upset.\u201cHow much more is needed to quench your thirst?\u201d Ye Xiao rubbed his chin and felt completely depressed.However, at least he felt satisfied for what happened today. Actually he even felt a bit rapturous. It was because of the acquisition of the Heaven\u2019s Cyan!Ye Xiao took out the box and thought, \u201cIf the egg dares to absorb my Heaven\u2019s Cyan too, I would not care about what creature\u2019s egg it is any more and smash it into many pieces before I eat it!\u201dHe couldn\u2019t help smiling when thinking about it and he murmured, \u201cBad egg\u2026 Bad egg\u2026 Everybody is saying that I am a bad egg. Now what I have here is the real bad\u2026 No kidding\u2026\u201dWhen he opened the box, he sensed some joyfulness spreading through the environment of the space. The next moment, a strong force attacked the box.BANNG! The box was crushed into pieces at once and the Heaven\u2019s Cyan burst out of the box and flew into the air.The Heaven\u2019s Cyan was intact!It was actually entirely absorbed!Ye Xiao was totally stunned to see what just happened. Then he widened his eyes!The space was twisting and the purple qi was swaying. Suddenly the space expanded. The purple qi then spread over and there it was \u2013 a brand new cyan space had appeared!The cyan space then slowly moved adjacent to the first temple.The accessorial space was about a dozen meters wide surrounded by white mist. And standing at its center was the Heaven\u2019s Cyan.It looked like the Heaven\u2019s Cyan had always been there and that it wasn\u2019t brought from somewhere else.Everything had blended into a harmonious whole!The next moment, a lot of white qi flowed towards the cyan space like a storm. The space was quickly filled up! And yet, the qi did not stop flowing into the Heaven\u2019s Cyan!All Ye Xiao could see was that the Heaven\u2019s Cyan was quivering and some new leaves were growing one by one on it. Suddenly his vision turned black and the very next moment, when it returned, he was already outside of the sphere and back in his own room!For a while, he was still shocked and lost in amazement!It looked like the space could feed the Heaven\u2019s Cyan!Also the Heaven\u2019s Cyan could be planted in the space safely!That was to say that in a short time, Ye Xiao could have an inconsumable Tree of Cultivating Tea forever and carry it around!Thinking of this, Ye Xiao started feeling better and quickly got through his depression. Infact, he had even started to feel euphoric.He sat cross-legged and started cultivating!\u201cThe sun is shining upon the sky. The purple qi rises for me.\u201dYe Xiao performed the basic cultivation task nine hundred times daily.He knew that his cultivation was still at a low grade and was still far from the point where the qi would fluently circulate within his inner body channels, automatically performing his cultivation. The only way for him to improve himself was through hard work!Ye Xiao sat quietly and meditated.He had no idea that the crown Prince\u2019s Palace was now in a mess.But even if he knew, he wouldn\u2019t care at all!\u2026Wang Xiao-Nian was brought to the crown Prince\u2019s Palace. He felt that something must be wrong and his legs started to quiver.When he got into the main house, he felt like his heart had stopped beating!He felt extremely cold in his heart!In the yard of the main house, three dead bodies were placed on the ground, covered in white sheets.One of them had a deep sword-stab wound in the chest. It went through the body, from the chest to the back and it had left a large hole. The hands were lying aside. The sleeves of the robe were uncovered and there was a golden flower embroidered in each of the sleeves.The golden flowers were so eye-catching.Wang Xiao-Nian looked at the shiny golden flowers and nearly passed out.It was not some ordinary flower. To Wang Xiao-Nian, it was the symbol of\u2026 Mu Cheng-Bai!The day when they hung out together, Wang Xiao-Nian had seen Mu Cheng-Bai wearing this robe! He recognized the golden flowers on the sleeves at once.\u201cMu Cheng-Bai is dead?\u201d Wang Xiao-Nian almost freaked out.For him, Mu Cheng-Bai was someone who could not be killed by anyone!The crown prince was sitting still and wore a bright yellow robe. He looked down at Wang Xiao-Nian with a serious look and a sharp gaze.\u201cWang Xiao-Nian?\u201d\u201cYes, your highness.\u201d\u201cThe day before yesterday, was it you who had accompanied Mu Cheng-Bai?\u201d The crown prince spoke with a calm voice. He didn\u2019t look emotional at all.Beside him was a girl wearing the royal clothes. She was currently staring at Wang Xiao-Nian. She had a slim body, white skin and a pretty face, but her eyes were swollen and red, showing traces of tears.\u201cY\u2026 Yes.\u201d Wang Xiao-Nian quivered.\u201cHe is dead.\u201d The crown prince spoke the three words in a peaceful voice, but to Wang Xiao-Nian it was like thunder to his ears.Wang Xiao-Nian\u2019s pupils suddenly expanded, as he felt his gallbladder breaking apart due to fear!The crown prince looked at him, and spoke slowly, \u201cTell me every detail about the events from that day.\u201d\u201cY\u2026 Yes, your highness. Hmmm\u2026\u201d Wang Xiao-Nian was quivering and could hardly speak. He then licked his lips and bit his tongue heavily so that he calmed down, \u201cThat day, I hung out with lord Mu. He said that he wanted some herbs, so we went to the Hui-Tian Street\u2026 When we had only just arrived, we ran into this guy named Ye Xiao.\u201d\u201cYe Xiao?!\u201d The girl sitting beside the crown prince suddenly looked up and stared at him with sharp eyes, \u201cSon of the Northern General Ye Nan-Tian? One of the \u2018three lords\u2019 of the capital, Ye Xiao?\u201d\u201cYes, it was him.\u201d Wang Xiao-Nian lowered his head hastily.He lowered his head because he was too scared by the girl\u2019s sharp eyes. He didn\u2019t even dare to look her in the eyes at all.\u201cGo on.\u201d The girl spoke, while the crown prince kept quiet.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWang Xiao-Nian realised that this girl was most likely the sister of Mu Cheng-Bai, the crown prince\u2019s wife.\u201cCoincidently Ye Xiao was there to buy some herbs too\u2026 and the thing he wanted to buy\u2026 was\u2026 was the one thing lord Mu had targeted. So\u2026 So they got into a fight\u2026\u201d Wang Xiao-Nian spoke haltingly.\u201cWait! Mu Cheng-Bai didn\u2019t know Ye Xiao. He would never know his name, as he hated the foppish-lord kind. How did he recognize Ye Xiao?\u201d The crown prince interrupted.Wang Xiao-Nian was stunned.How did Mu Cheng-Bai recognize Ye Xiao? He felt that it was now impossible for him to get out of this!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Mu Cheng-Bai didn\u2019t know Ye Xiao at the beginning. You hate Ye Xiao because he had extorted you. When you saw him, you encouraged Mu Cheng-Bai to pick a quarrel with him. Is that right?\u201d The crown prince said in a rather calm and peaceful voice.But this calm and peaceful voice made Wang Xiao-Nian nervous. It almost made him pass out due to sheer fear.\u201cY\u2026 Yes\u2026 Your highness\u2026\u201dWang Xiao-Nian spoke out these words with difficulty. He could clearly sense the much colder gaze from the crown princess. He couldn\u2019t help quivering.\u201cThen what?\u201d\u201cAnd then they had a wrangle\u2026 And then Ye Xiao suddenly h\u2026 hit lord Mu\u2026 He knocked lord Mu down to the floor\u2026 Then lord Mu ordered his guards to fight back\u2026 Then Ye Xiao ran away\u2026 Then lord Mu and his guards ran after him\u2026\u201dWang Xiao-Nian\u2019s face turned pale. He was sweating profusely as he stutteringly narrated the events which had taken place.\u201cYe Xiao hit lord Mu and knocked him down to the floor\u2026\u201d The crown prince frowned, \u201cAs far as I know, Ye Xiao is one of the \u2018three foppish lords\u2019. He is just a fool, living a meaningless life, only to eventually waste away\u2026 Lord Mu had reached the top of the Grade of Renyuan\u2026 And there were two guards with him!\u201dHe looked at Wang Xiao-Nian doubtfully, \u201cDid Ye Xiao really beat lord Mu and knock him down to the floor?\u201d\u201cY\u2026 Yes, your highness\u2026 Th\u2026 That\u2019s true\u2026\u201d Wang Xiao-Nian stuttered. He was on the verge of fainting by the time he finished speaking. He couldn\u2019t believe that he had drawn this much bad luck.If it hadn\u2019t been for his plans to take revenge on Ye Xiao, would lord Mu have been involved in this ordeal?In his opinion, the useless trash, Ye Xiao, really deserved to die. But while Ye Xiao had managed to survive, the young lord Mu, who really didn\u2019t deserve to die prematurely, had passed away instead!Wang Xiao-Nian felt like he was being pranked by a god!This\u2026 this is just absurd!\u201cOh\u2026 Ok.\u201d The crown prince nodded, \u201cGo on.\u201d\u201cYe Xiao fled away and lord Mu chased after him with his guards\u2026 and\u2026 And then I w\u2026 went ho\u2026 home\u2026\u201d Wang Xiao-Nian finally couldn\u2019t hold his tears any longer and started to cry loudly, \u201cPlease, your highness\u2026 I know nothing about what happened next\u2026\u201d\u201cYou started all this\u2026 You forced my brother into this fight\u2026 And while he was fighting against Ye Xiao, you actually just went home? And now that my brother has been killed, you dare to tell me that you don\u2019t even know how it happened?!\u201d The crown princess stared bitterly at Wang Xiao-Nian.

He was so scared that it felt like his soul was trying to escape his body.\u201cGuards! Take this useless garbage out and chop his head off!\u201d The crown princess was so angry that she immediately gave the order to the royal guards. Wang Xiao-Nian heard this and immediately lost consciousness.The crown prince waved his hand and frowned, \u201cWang Xiao-Nian was just a remote cause. There\u2019s no need to kill him. It may force Wang Da-Nian to betray us if we kill his son. After all he is leading the royal guards\u2026 Besides, I think there is still a lot of things we don\u2019t know about, regarding Mu Cheng-Bai\u2019s death.\u201d\u201cUncertainties?\u201d The crown princess frowned angrily, \u201cWhat bloody uncertainties could there be?\u201d\u201cYe Xiao is just a stupid foppish lad. He absolutely does not possess the abilities to kill Mu Cheng-Bai!\u201d The crown prince clasped his hands behind his back, \u201cThere must be a third party\u2026 that we don\u2019t know of\u2026 involved in this case.\u201dHis eyes lit up, \u201cThis case needs a detailed investigation.\u201d\u201cThis Ye Xiao must definitely be involved!\u201d The crown princess was emitting a strong killing intent, \u201cI can not let my brother die in vain! Ye Xiao must be buried with him!\u201dThe crown prince smiled bitterly, \u201cWell we need to discuss it further. Ye Xiao is nothing, but his father, Ye Nan-Tian, holds a strong army and defends the north. He is the backbone of our kingdom. In the north, he is almost like a king. Besides, the world is currently in a great disturbance and other kingdoms are maniacal. Wars are aroused frequently and our princes are all constantly fighting to protect our kingdom\u2026 To kill the great general\u2019s son in this period of time\u2026 is truly not a smart move!\u201dThe crown princess turned offish, \u201cChen Bang-Guo! We can\u2019t do this and we can\u2019t do that! So are you saying that we should just let my brother die in vain?!\u201dThe crown prince sighed, \u201cFirst things first. We shouldn\u2019t focus on just one or two aspects, we need to focus on the overall situation and find the real culprit\u2026 Fine\u2026 Let\u2019s check on Ye Xiao first. If the murderer truly is someone else and we have killed Ye Xiao without giving him a chance to explain, we will have lost our only lead and let the actual murderer get away. That would really be the situation in which your brother would have died in vain\u201cFine! I will wait for the news!\u201d The crown princess humph and walked away with a beautiful scent trailing her. She turned her head around when she got to the door and yelled, \u201cNo mercy for this bastard Wang Xiao-Nian!\u201d\u201cEighty cudgel beatings!\u201d The crown prince frowned, \u201cLet the god judge whether he should die or live.\u201dEighty cudgel beatings could kill a normal cultivator. Wang Xiao-Nian was just a normal young lord who was already weak because of immoderate debauchery. Even though he had cultivated, more or less, it was not worth mentioning.If he really got the eighty cudgel beatings, he would absolutely die. So after thinking for a while, he said, \u201cLet Wang Da-Nian carry out this!\u201dLet Wang Da-Nian carry out the punishment to his own son\u2026 How could the lad die if so?\u201cHumph!\u201d The crown princess was pissed and left.The crown prince made sure his wife was gone, clapped and asked, \u201cHow\u2019s your investigation?\u201dA man in black came in humbly and answered, \u201cThe whole thing is generally the same with what Wang Xiao-Nian said. But there is something weird.\u201dThe crown prince frowned and didn\u2019t say anything.The man went on, \u201cFirst of all, the witnesses said that they had seen Ye Xiao knock down Mu Cheng-Bai. It is weird because it is impossible that Ye Xiao has the capability to do so.So I checked the body of Mu Cheng-Bai and found that\u2026 his dantian was wounded. But we all know that it was the hit on his back that took his life; it is a very clean hit\u2026So what happened to his dantian is suspicious. It is obvious\u2026 that someone had blocked his dantian. That\u2019s why Ye Xiao could knock him down\u2026 Whoever blocked his dantian is absolutely a world-class elite cultivator!\u201d\u201cA world-class elite cultivator\u2026\u201d The crown prince murmured, he paced around and nodded, \u201cWhat else?\u201d\u201cYes, your highness. When Mu Cheng-Bai was chasing after Ye Xiao,Ye Xiao didn\u2019t get very far. He hid behind some street debris after he turned around a corner and, after he saw lord Mu and the two guards run by, he went home. There are a lot of witnesses to this occurrence\u2026\u201dIt seemed like Ye Xiao had somehow mislead the spectators to believe in his escape, which had clearly worked.The crown prince frowned, feeling increasingly puzzled by these developments.The man in black continued, \u201cBut lord Mu hadn\u2019t noticed this. So he ran all the way to the \u2018a hill, a forest and a lake\u2019, which is where he and his two guards were killed. There are still a lot of unknown factors. I can\u2019t quite figure it out yet.\u201dThe crown prince nodded, \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe fatal wounds on the three of them are all very clean\u2026 The two guards were cut at the same time and the wrist of one guard was completely broken. From this, I concluded that the murderer seized the sword from one of the guards and killed both of the guards at the same time! It is absolutely not a move that could be performed by an ordinary cultivator. Even a man who has reached the top of the Grade of Diyuan is incapable of doing this. The murderer is more like\u2026\u201d The man in black hesitated for a second and said, \u201c\u2026like an actual swordmaster\u2026 A sword master of the Grade of Tianyuan!\u201dThe man in black felt cold sweat dripping down his back as he spoke out the last few words.The crown prince raised his eyebrows and looked up, \u201cA swordmaster of the Grade of Tianyuan\u2026 Are you sure?\u201d\u201cYes, your highness.\u201d The man in black lowered his head.The crown prince was silent for a while, and then he spoke, \u201cSo\u2026 This all had nothing to do with Ye Xiao?\u201dThe man in black hesitated slightly before he answered, \u201cIt is uncertain.\u201d\u201cIf there is a third force that got to Cheng-Bai, to whom does it belong? For what reason did they kill him?\u201d The crown prince asked as he was absorbed in these thoughts, within his voice, a strong sense of horror could be discerned. The man in black quietly listened to the crown prince as he humbly stood aside.The crown prince was just talking to himself. He didn\u2019t want any answers for the question. And the man in black didn\u2019t dare to answer it.There were too many variables and uncertainties in this whole ordeal.With half closed eyes the crown prince calmly ordered, \u201cStart from Ye Xiao. Move the investigation along from there\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, your highness.\u201d\u201cAnything else you might be working on\u2026 should be suspended.\u201dThe crown prince turned around elegantly, flicked the sleeves of his bright yellow robe, and then he left calmly.But the man in black was extremely nervous. He had been following the crown prince for many years now, so he knew better than anyone else that when the crown prince shows an unusually calm attitude, his heart would infact resemble a raging inferno!He had already deeply etched this into his mind.But he couldn\u2019t understand why the crown prince had told him to suspend all his other cases.The man in black felt cold sweat dripping on his back. He clearly understood that it was very possible that in the near future, endless amounts of blood would dye the sky and land of his beloved capital dark red!There were also words that he didn\u2019t dare to tell the crown prince \u2013 Even though Ye Xiao might not be the one to have taken Mu Cheng-Bai\u2019s life, this didn\u2019t make the investigation any easier. Besides the other princes, there were also another eight noble clans that\u2019d be very happy to see Mu Cheng-Bai\u2019s early demise.But all the man in black could do, was to keep these words deep inside his heart.\u2026At this moment, Ye Xiao was sitting cross-legged and carefully started to feel the change and increase of the qi in his dantian. This was something he enjoyed very much, because it gave him an intense feeling of getting stronger. As a matter of fact, this was a feeling every cultivator would crave for!While Ye Xiao was enjoying this wonderful feeling, the steward entered his room quietly and made a gentle cough.Ye Xiao opened his eyes at once and asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe steward was very surprised when he saw Ye Xiao sitting in a cultivating pose. He then said, \u201cMy lord, there is one thing that needs your affirmance.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Ye Xiao frowned.\u201cWas it you who killed Mu Cheng-Bai?\u201d The steward looked at Ye Xiao as he asked directly.This question, that was asked with such a peaceful tone really stunned Ye Xiao.Every time Ye Xiao met this steward, he found him more and more mysterious, he was truly an interesting fellow. He was definitely not a simple man!.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 24 \u2013 You just wouldn\u2019t stop getting in trouble, huh?\u201cWhat Mu Cheng-Bai? Who is Mu Cheng-Bai?\u201d Ye Xiao had opened his eyes really wide and they were filled with curiosity as he looked at the steward.It was only reasonable that Ye Xiao would play innocent. After all, the man he had killed was not only the brother-in-law of the crown prince, but was also from the Mu clan \u2013 one of the eight noble clans! There were things that could be done in the shadows, but one should never openly talk about it.\u201cMu Cheng-Bai, the young master of the Mu clan, the older brother of the crown princess, and brother-in-law of the crown prince.\u201d The steward spoke slowly and stared deeply into Ye Xiao\u2019s eyes, \u201cThree days ago, you got into a disagreement with him, which turned violent, young master\u2026 Eventually you ran away and he quickly chased after you\u2026 What happened after that\u2026 Nobody knows.\u201dHe stopped for a second trying to spot some kind of change in Ye Xiao\u2019s behavior, but shortly after, he continued, \u201cWhat everybody knows is that you came back safely and Mu Cheng-Bai died.\u201dYe Xiao smiled deviously, \u201cWell if no one knows what happens, then it certainly doesn\u2019t have to be me who killed him, right? If I were to be blamed for the deaths of everyone who got killed secretly, then I would be a mass murderer! Besides\u2026 Do you really think I actually have the capabilities to kill anyone?\u201dThe steward stood calmly with a straight back and said in an almost inaudible whisper, \u201cA perfect defense, young master\u2026 However, I know that it was you.\u201dHearing these words Ye Xiao couldn\u2019t help but frown.This steward was acting too calmly and seemed too certain of his words.Before Ye Xiao could clearly think it over, the steward continued, \u201cLet\u2019s put aside the topic of who made the killing blows, you\u2019re definitely going to be investigated, so we should make proper preparations for when this investigation happens. If something unexpected happens, you\u2019ll only be able to feel regret in your afterlife.\u201cEven though your defense is perfect, you\u2019re still the prime suspect in this case. Mu Cheng-Bai isn\u2019t just some random farmer\u2019s son, he\u2019s the young master from the Mu clan and the older brother of the crown princess. And at the end of the day, they\u2019ll have to catch someone. If they fail to find a scapegoat, that someone might just as well be you.\u201dYe Xiao was collecting his thoughts and could only reply with an, \u201cOh?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I wish to discuss this with you, young master. I suggest that we order the 36 blood-robe guards to send you to your father in the north.\u201d The steward spoke calmly, \u201cYou are the only son of the general! You are the heir! You can\u2019t die!\u201dYe Xiao smiled and asked, \u201cTo the north? To hide from trouble by using my father\u2019s might?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The steward answered humbly, \u201cIt is currently too dangerous to linger around here any longer. I am afraid that everyone in this house might meet an early demise if we stay.\u201d The steward sighed.He felt completely speechless and inconsolable about this situation. This brat had promised him not even two days ago that he would definitely \u2018never make any trouble\u2019. But almost before this sentence had left Ye Xiao\u2019s mouth, he had already gone ahead and slaughtered the brother-in-law of the crown prince\u2026 If this couldn\u2019t be considered \u2018making trouble\u2019, then what could?Even in a scenario where Ye Xiao didn\u2019t kill anybody, he\u2019d still be the most obvious suspect. This fact alone was unbearable for his family. If the crown prince actually wanted to kill him, he would only have to lift a finger and there\u2019d be nothing anyone could do about it.Besides, there was also an extremely powerful force behind all this \u2013 the Mu clan!The steward really didn\u2019t know what to say and thought, \u201cWhat is there I can say\u2026 For god\u2019s sake\u2026 Was it that hard to behave well for a couple of days? And here I actually believed that you had reformed yourself and that you had prepared to be a good lad for once\u2026 I even proudly send a letter to the general about this, but even before this letter will reach him, you\u2019ve brought such a calamity upon yourself!\u201d\u201cNah\u2026\u201d Said Ye Xiao.As these words reached the steward he kept himself composed on the outside, but in his mind, he was actually seriously complaining,\u201dThis whole thing is already a huge trouble for us and if that wasn\u2019t enough, you actually dare to speak these words without a care in the world\u201d He almost fell over, completely gobsmacked, \u201cNo?!\u201d\u201cNope, not going\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao spoke peacefully, \u201cIf I were to run off to my father every time a little problem came my way, then how could I possible call myself a man?\u201dThe steward\u2019s eyes lit up, as he stared incredulously at Ye Xiao.\u201cWhat is going on?! Is this really my young master? At what point in time did he grow a pair?\u201d He thought.\u201cUrgh\u2026 It is good to have a strong sense of responsibility\u2026\u201d This was the first time that the steward had seen this young lord act like a man, so he wanted to give him a word or two of praise. However, he then quickly turned solemn, \u201cBut you have to know which battles to pick and this one right now, is not the right fight. We should start by preparing countermeasures for all possible situations which may occur.\u201dHe looked at Ye Xiao wishfully and thought, \u201cWell\u2026 If you\u2019ve actually grown up just a little bit\u2026 Then please figure out a plan as perfect as your defense and share it with me.\u201dThe steward still kept himself composed on the outside, but there was a raging storm of worry brewing in his heart. However, he had already made his decision long ago: To sacrifice the lives of the 36 blood robe guards alongside his own to safely escort his young master to his father in the north!\u201cHmm\u2026 There isn\u2019t anything special that should be prepared. Just let things run their own course\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao humphed and continued, \u201cIt really isn\u2019t all that big of a deal really\u2026 Firstly, there is no evidence whatsoever. Secondly, I am nothing more than an unlikely suspect at the moment. Thirdly, the crown prince can\u2019t afford to start a brawl with one of the great generals of the kingdom if he wishes to become king one day. And lastly\u2026\u201dThe steward\u2019s eyes immediately lit up as he felt Ye Xiao was really growing up to the point where he even started to speak wisely, so he eagerly asked, \u201cWhat is this last reason?\u201d\u201cLastly\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao humphed and rolled his eyes, \u201cIf they are really going to mess around with me and manage to piss me off, I\u2019ll just kill the crown prince too. One kill will then bring peace and everything will then be solved as well!\u201dAs the last few words left Ye Xiao\u2019s mouth the steward felt like he was going to faint.\u201cWhat is wrong with this guy???!!!!\u201dThe first three reasons had made sense and made Ye Xiao seem like he had actually grown up, but when the last reason finally left his the mouth, all the steward wanted to do was to curse loudly at this foppish lord!\u201cWhat a bastard! If this can be called a plan, then jumping off a hill completely naked would be a good plan to learn to fly. If these words of yours were to be spread to the public, it wouldn\u2019t even matter if you actually killed Mu Cheng-Ba\u2026 You\u2019d have your head chopped off and sliced in eight hundred pieces anyway! You fxxking little shit! Fxxk! Fxxk! Fxxk!\u201d The steward\u2019s mind at the moment was in complete panic and disarray.\u201cOhh\u2026 Noo\u2026 Ohhhhh\u2026\u201d The usual calm and composed steward now felt extremely depressed and was actually stomping his feet on the floor. After hearing the last few words of Ye Xiao, he had quickly cast aside the idea that this young master would actually come up with a good plan, so he depressingly said, \u201cJust forget it\u2026 I\u2019ll go arrange the guards to escort you right away!\u201d\u201cNo. I don\u2019t need that. Really.\u201d Ye Xiao looked very confident as he said these words, \u201cThree days of protection from some guards will be enough to ensure our safety\u2026\u201dHe paced around a bit and eventually said, \u201cArrange for some people to spread around some gossip. Just let them say\u2026 That I actually killed the crown prince\u2019s brother-in-law and that the crown prince has gone crazy, looking to chop me into a million pieces! \u2026That should do the trick. Do make sure that this will be the leading story in the capital within the shortest possible time!\u201dShock filled the steward\u2019s face, before he quickly praised his young master, \u201cNice! Good plan\u2026\u201d But as these words left his mouth he frowned, \u201cIf we do it like this, then the crown prince will not dare to act boldly in bright daylight, but the possible stealthy attacks will be hard to defend against\u2026 Besides\u2026 even if we survive the actions taken by the crown prince, the Mu clan is also looking for the murderer and they\u2019re much more ferocious and dangerous than the crown prince.\u201dYe Xiao looked at the steward and said carelessly, \u201cWell, nothing that can be done about that right now\u2026 People will do their best to slaughter us, we either move our heads forward and face them like men, or we move our heads back and hide in the shadows, like little chickens\u2026 Why are you still so anxious? Who could have possibly predicted Mu Cheng-Bai would have this kind of luck and died just like that? Misfortune loves me!\u201dThe steward was completely gobsmacked and thought, \u201cOh\u2026 You\u2019re trying to say that Mu Cheng-Bai is actually luckier than you are? His body has been partly eaten by wild animals before it was found and who knows how much it has rotten by now\u2026 At the very least, you are still alive\u2026\u201dA while ago the steward had looked completely confident that his young master was the killer of Mu Cheng-Bai. This was, however, only a show, as he truly couldn\u2019t believe that his young \u2018foppish\u2019 master actually had the capabilities to kill Mu Cheng-Bai.Mu Cheng-Bai might not be anything special, but for the steward, the strength of Mu Cheng-Bai couldn\u2019t be mentioned in the same sentence as Ye Xiao\u2019s strength \u2013 Ye Xiao was just a foppish black sheep who enjoyed women more than he enjoyed cultivation, his strength was absolutely rubbish!The steward was confident in his knowledge concerning Ye Xiao. He was of the opinion that if Ye Xiao could actually kill Mu Cheng-Bai, with a single attack \u2013 the heir of the Mu clan\u2026 then the Mu clan should just disband already\u2026He was trying to collect his thoughts as he heard his young master murmur a few words, \u201cIf the Mu clan dares to piss me off, then watch me annihilate them\u2026\u201dIf the earlier dialogues weren\u2019t reason enough for the steward to faint, then the line spoken right now it definitely was! In his long life, he had met all kinds of people, but never had he met someone who could gloat like his young master was doing right now.\u201cDo you even know how powerful the Mu clan is? If you did\u2026 You wouldn\u2019t dare to murmur those words, or even think about them for that matter?! You won\u2019t die if you stop boasting\u2026\u201d The steward was thinking.Sadly, the steward would never come to know, that Ye Xiao would not hesitate to deal with the Mu Clan if they came looking for trouble.\u2026As the plan was pretty straightforward, the steward immediately went into action. He quickly formed a team to spread the rumor that Ye Xiao had killed Mu Cheng-Bai. The story they were to spread was purposely exaggerated and consisted about eighty percent truth, with some lies hidden in between. Whoever heard this rumor dismissed it quickly with words like, \u201cYe Xiao? The foppish lord Ye Xiao? The crown prince believes that guy can actually kill Mu Cheng Bai, like really\u2026 is he stupid?\u201d\u201cWhat the fxxk! Can\u2019t you come up with better jokes?!\u201d\u201cHa ha, that dude? Really? How is that even possible?\u201d\u201cPah hah ha. How highly can some people think of that foppish lord?!\u201d\u201cI\u2019d already find it hard to believe if you told me that he killed a chicken, but you are actually claiming that he somehow managed to kill an expert cultivator\u2026 Seriously dude\u2026. Go home. Even if a donkey would\u2019ve hit my head and knocked all sense out of it, even then I wouldn\u2019t believe you\u2026\u201dWith these reactions, the public was actually defending Ye Xiao from the crown prince. If the crown prince would still make a move on him, then he would become the laughingstock of the capital!Once he\u2019d become the laughingstock of the capital\u2026 his authority would be questioned: \u2018how could such a dumb lad become our king?\u2019 \u2018If he couldn\u2019t even spot the vivid truth in front of him, then how many people would find an unjust end by his hands?\u2019 \u2018Today the crown prince can\u2019t see the simple truth that is right in front of him and actually killed the son of one of our great generals\u2026 When he becomes king one day\u2026. Is he going to kill a minister if he farts?\u2019Even though the rumors were doing their job, the steward still went ahead and secretly arranged for the 36 blood robe guards to protect his young master \u2013 having them ready to defend Ye Xiao at a moment\u2019s notice. And if all else failed, he could also use these guards to lead Ye Xiao out of the capital and towards General Ye\u2019s army in the north!The sun hadn\u2019t even reached its highest point, yet the rumor was spreading like wildfire. People were discussing it throughout the entire capital!\u201cHey, have you heard? The Lord Ye, one of the \u2018three lords\u2019, has really outdone himself this time!\u201d\u201cWhat did he do this time?\u2026\u201d\u201cIt is said that he slaughtered the crown prince\u2019s brother-in-law\u2026\u201d\u201cWait\u2026 Seriously?! What exactly happened? Quickly! Tell me everything!\u201d\u201cIt is said that\u2026\u201d\u201cAha\u2026 Hmm? Wait a minute\u2026 No\u2026 You just said that Ye Xiao has killed the crown prince\u2019s brother-in-law\u2026 Isn\u2019t that fellow from the Mu clan?? Isn\u2019t he even their heir? An expert cultivator?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 Yes\u2026\u201d\u201cYou bloody fool! Even a donkey isn\u2019t as stupid as you are\u2026 Don\u2019t you know what Ye Xiao is like? I might believe you if you told me Ye Xiao killed a beggar, but you actually claim he killed an expert cultivator from a noble clan\u2026 I will never believe this. Not even if lightning would kill you right now\u2026\u201d\u201cHey dude! Seriously? Mind your language! Why do I have to die\u2026\u201d\u201cYou bloody deserve it, you fool!

Ye Xiao killing Mu Cheng-Bai\u2026 You actually believe that? Hahahahahahaha\u2026\u201d\u2026The rumor was spreading as fast as lightning all over the Chen-Xing City, and it kept on spreading further and further at an unimaginable pace!This event suddenly became a joke everywhere in the capital.The Crown Prince\u2019s Palace had been preparing to take actions, but then they suddenly became muddled because of this unforeseen and overwhelming rumor!\u201cAt the moment this rumor has caused quite a stir in the capital\u2026 If we insist on going for Ye Xiao at present, it will be difficult. I have a lot of misgivings about this.\u201d A middle-aged counselor was sitting opposite the crown prince. He smiled bitterly, \u201cBesides, I heard that the king is also paying attention to this event.\u201dThe counselor\u2019s words seemed to purposely hint towards a certain direction.\u201cMy father is also paying attention\u2026\u201d The crown prince smiled and said lightly, \u201cIt seems that\u2026 there is a tricky and capable person in the General\u2019s House who is pulling the strings. They stir up the public opinions and let us be trapped in the scruples\u2026 Interesting. Heh\u2026\u201d\u201cSo, we have only two options.\u201d The counselor calmly said.\u201cGo with the second one.\u201d The crown prince didn\u2019t even ask what the two options were and spoke decisively, \u201cFollow the normal procedure. Let the ministry of penalty do the investigation\u2026 Try to reduce a big trouble into a small one, and a small one into nothing. At least make it look good at the official level\u2026 After all, we need to consider the reaction of General Ye. The first option is too uncompromising and we can\u2019t do that!\u201dThe counselor nodded, \u201cYes, your highness. I got it.\u201dThat was right. The crown prince only ordered everything to look nice from the government\u2019s perspective, but he didn\u2019t mention anything about the involvement of clans or about the common folk.Of course he didn\u2019t need to consider about those two yet.The counselor had left for a while and the crown prince was still sitting there quietly.His eyes were flashing as he was murmuring, \u201cMortal? Mortal world? \u2026\u201dAnd then he suddenly let out a chilling laugh, \u201cThe glory, splendor, wealth and rank in the mortal world are wonderful things that those boring guys will never understand! They only run after the so-called ultimate goal! Even if the mortal life is just an experience spanning a limited time, at least I will taste every bit of it. If you are not a fish, then how do you know what constitutes the enjoyment of fishes\u2026 How dare you talk such nonsense that we are nonentities\u2026\u201dHe stopped laughing and stood up, and then left with long strides.\u2026Ye Xiao was sitting cross-legged and was feeling the East-rising Purple Qi silently circulate inside his body. It was a wonderful feeling that comforted him with each passing second, and he was truly enjoying it so much that he completely forgot about the passage of time and neglected to wake up.One after another, strands of qi were entering his body through his skin.When he thought about the time he killed Mu Cheng-Bai, he had mixed feelings.He understood that under the present circumstances, killing Mu Cheng-Bai was really a stupid move, because a lot of people had seen him fight against Mu Cheng-Bai that day. They had witnessed it personally. It was absolutely impossible to wipe out the witnesses. He knew that he shouldn\u2019t do it but he did it anyway. That meant that he had also put himself into a very dangerous situation.But he had to do it. Even though he knew it was a bad idea, he still went for it!Because he could feet that after being reborn in this body, the former owner\u2019s personality and instincts was still influencing him.And former Ye Xiao\u2019s personality showed irresoluteness and cowardice.He had no determination nor any sense of responsibility! All these foppish stupid young lords were in the same situation.Ye Xiao even felt that, as of this moment, he was way inferior to his previous invincible self.Occasionally, he even feels that, he is no longer a true cultivator.He knew that he couldn\u2019t let this situation escalate any further, so he used this opportunity to bring about a great danger for himself so as to arouse the instincts of his prior life.He wanted to completely get rid of the impact of the former Ye Xiao!So, although he knew that it wouldn\u2019t do him any good, he still did it with decisiveness.That was to revive his survival instincts in the face of extreme danger and to sharpen himself by overcoming these perilous situations!While he was collecting his thoughts, the qi in his body suddenly started to boil, and then it gradually pulsed along towards his Jing and Mai. Ye Xiao didn\u2019t dare to be careless, so he calmed his mind and restrained the pulses step by step. However the amount of qi going haywire was too much for him to possibly regulate, and he started to feel sick. Ye Xiao still worked very hard to perform the supreme spiritual method [2], but the longer he cultivated, the worse he felt. The qi in his body was refusing to calm down.Ye Xiao was experienced in cultivating, and so, he remained calm in such a situation. The boiling qi, although hazardous, was also a fantastic opportunity. If he stopped the East-rising Purple Qi from rampaging, it would gradually slow down, would eventually clear away and the danger would pass. If he decided to bear with it, the possible benefits would definitely be tremendous. But if he succumbed to the boiling qi, his Jing and Mai would definitely be damaged.If Ye Xiao followed the conventional knowledge about the principles of cultivation, he should have stopped cultivating the moment the qi in his body started to boil. However, at that moment, he suddenly felt inspired \u2013 actually, it was his intuition, that if he stopped now, he would miss out on a golden opportunity!He had to choose between experience and intuition, and the Xiao Monarch decided to go with the latter!He grinded his teeth and continued cultivating!But it didn\u2019t get better at all. Instead, he felt his dantian bulging, and was on the verge of exploding. If the continuous accumulation of qi inside his Jing and Mai continued, it would certainly explode!Ye Xiao was terrified.The current situation was beyond his knowledge. The result of this gamble was uncertain!Did this mean that his intuition was wrong?!But, just when he was about to consider stopping, the boiling qi in his dantian calmed down!After a while, the boiling qi that settled suddenly flowed back towards his dantian. At the same time, an unbearable piercing pain coursed throughout his body. Ye Xia instantly blacked out after spitting out a mouthful of blood!In an instant, everything in front of him was dyed red with blood!The next moment, the rolling qi in his dantian oddly separated into two parts; one was red while the other was blue!Ye Xiao realized that these were two types of qi with different attributes.The red qi contained the power of scorching hot flames; it felt like it could incinerate everything. And the blue qi contained a power of intense coldness; it felt like it could freeze anything.Were these two options for him to choose from?One stayed while the other disappeared?Or could they both coexist within him; one representing yin and the other, yang [1]?Ye Xiao frowned; it was really a tough choice.The power of the scorching red scorching qi was surely good, but the power of the blue gelid qi also had its own advantages.Ye Xiao didn\u2019t want to give up on either of them.He thought about it for a while longer and finally decided to mainly cultivate the power of the blue gelid qi.He was still in one of the realms under the same firmament as in his previous world. He was known for his scorching hot attacks in his previous life and he had even reincarnated in a body which shared the same name.If he managed to draw the attention of the three factions and was identified as the Xiao Monarch, it would certainly result in his death, because he would never be able to resist them in his present condition. He should do everything in his power to prevent them from finding out about his identity as the late Xiao Monarch before he became strong enough to oppose them.Basically, if a cultivator lost all his cultivation and had to rebuild it, he would choose to cultivate the method and attribute that he was familiar with; he would never choose to cultivate in another attribute, let alone a conflicting one.Therefore, the ultra cold attribute was a perfect mask for Ye Xiao.In fact, there was another reason why Ye Xiao chose to cultivate the gelid qi.The East-rising Purple Qi actually held a pure yang attribute, but at the moment, it showed a completely contrary attribute. Due to the profoundness of the East-rising Purple Qi, Ye Xiao thought that this gelid qi must be something extraordinarily powerful.With that, the decision was made. Ye Xiao tried transferring the power of the gelid qi. He had only just started to guide it, before it suddenly moved quickly to fill up his dantian!Simultaneously, the red scorching qi also started to disappear from his body.And then a wave of gelid qi rushed out from the dantian and ran through every inch of the Jing and Mai. Wherever this gelid qi spread, the originally mild qi was immediately replaced by the gelid qi!While the attribute of the qi was switching, Ye Xiao actually felt his mind clear up like it never had before!There were streams of the clear power running around each and every inch of his body.Ye Xiao tried reaching a finger to tap on the chair nearby lightly.A wave of frost suddenly burst out from his fingers and froze the chair until it cracked!The power of the finger tap didn\u2019t stop and the chill rapidly spread in the air.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWithin the blink of an eye, the entire room turned into his own little ice cave.However, the coldness brought by the gelid qi brought an incredible comfort to Ye Xiao. He didn\u2019t feel cold; rather, he felt an endless pleasure surrounding him.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026[1]Yin and Yang : In Chinese philosophy, yin and yang describes how opposite or contrary forces are actually complementary. In this context, Yin represents the blue gelid qi, and Yang is used for the red scorching qi.[2]Supreme spiritual method : method used to cultivate the East-rising Purple Qi.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That was all!He stayed silent for a while and let out a sigh.\u201cThis power of the gelid qi could be a nice protection for me.\u201d Ye Xiao realized this and got lost in thoughts, \u201cBut\u2026 what should I do next\u2026\u201dMeanwhile, he vaguely heard some noises coming from outside the front door.The next moment the steward ran over in a hurry, \u201cMy lord, the government office of Chen-Xing City has sent some people. They want to ask you to cooperate with them to investigate a case. I think it must be the case of Mu Cheng-Bai\u2019s death.\u201dYe Xiao remained calm as he spoke, \u201cLet them in. Lead them to the antechamber and bring them some tea.\u201dThe steward nodded his head and hurried off.Ye Xiao preened himself a bit and then walked to the antechamber. As he stepped into the antechamber, he saw three men in official uniforms sitting there and drinking tea. The three of them gave off an uncomfortable feeling, as if they were a little restrained and nervous.After all this is the house of the Northern General and they were about to make an investigation against the young lord of this place\u2026Every man who served in the house was an experienced ex-soldier. When they learnt about the purpose of these three officers, their normal gaze naturally turned into something more intimidating, as they quickly started emitting a strong sense of killing intent.The expressions in their eyes were\u2026 unfriendly.The three officers were terrified. They felt like they had come across a bunch of hungry tigers. They were very uncomfortable and nearly started to shiver. It was truly not easy for them to sit there instead of rushing out.Beads of sweat had started to appear on their foreheads unknowingly and they really felt like they would lose the control of their bladder at any moment.When Ye Xiao leisurely arrived, they felt extremely relieved and thanked the gods!\u201cLord Ye!\u201d One of the officers stood up instantly, but as he did he felt his knees go weak, so he immediately sat back down on the chair. He had been resisting the killing intent released by those ex-soldiers and had nearly used up all of his energy, so when he suddenly stood up, he had become completely powerless.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Ye Xiao paced over lightly as if floating in the air and then sat on the chair. He sat down, semi-lying like he had no spine and raised one of his legs up. While everybody thought that he would cross his legs, he just laid the leg right on the armrest and let it dangle.Apparently he looked perfectly abhorrent without any presence. His eyes were dim and spiritless and he had a voluptuary look.The officer sighed in his mind and thought, \u201cLook at this brat\u2026 I really don\u2019t know what to say. It was truly a disaster for the general to have a son like him.\u201d\u201cYes, lord Ye. We are just following orders and have absolutely no intention of offending you.\u201d The officer said meekly, \u201cThere is a case that we need to ask you about.\u201d\u201cFine. Say it.\u201d Ye Xiao tilted his head lazily and started to dig the dirt from under his nails.\u201cWell\u2026 Mu Cheng-Bai\u2026 Young lord Mu was murdered. I think you should know about this\u2026\u201d\u201cMu Cheng-Bai? Who is that? Do I know him?\u201d Ye Xiao raised his head and looked confused.He actually was audacious enough to ask who Mu Cheng-Bai was\u2026 Everyone felt like Ye Xiao was trying to tell a bad joke.\u201cEh-hem\u2026\u201d The officer, who turned out to be the leader of the three, showed a stunned look on his face and coughed, \u201cWell I\u2019d like to tell you\u2026 Mu Cheng-Bai was the man with whom you fought several days ago\u2026 It is said that you were very brave that day and that you had actually beat him up. Very admirable\u2026\u201dYe Xiao pretended that he took a tumble, \u201cOh that bastard! He was trying to steal from me. He deserved to be punched\u2026 Hmm? What? He\u2019s dead? Nice! Who killed him? I would like to reward the killer\u2026\u201dThen he showed an interested look, \u201cHmmm wait. You are here to ask me about it now\u2026 Aha, did I kill the bastard? Oh I see\u2026 That day after I beat him up, he got home and his internal injury turned heavier, and then he died, right? That means\u2026 I am the one who killed him? Ahahahaha, I have improved again! I am so strong\u2026\u201dHe sounded completely narcissistic and showed no trace of nervousness.The officer was left speechless and coughed again, \u201cYou are mistaken\u2026 That afternoon somebody found him dead in the forest\u2026 That\u2019s all\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat? I did not kill him?\u201d Ye Xiao sighed disappointedly and then got angry, \u201cFxxk it! Why wasn\u2019t it me? That bastard had seriously pissed me off and I really wanted to arrange a group of mercenaries to go and kill him! Humph! How dare he! He should know who is taking charge here in Chen-Xing City! He should know how great I am and what a mistake it is to mess with me! He was digging over the king\u2019s head and dragging teeth from a tiger\u2019s mouth! It is really too easy for him to die like this!\u201dThe officer was stunned and thought, \u201cYou really dare talking! That was the heir of the Mu clan and the brother-in-law of the crown prince! Who\u2019s the wrong guy to mess with? You actually talk so big\u2026 If he was alive, you would be the one to get killed. Now you are actually saying that\u2026 it is too easy for him to die like this\u2026\u201dHe then licked his lips and was preparing to speak, but Ye Xiao continued to say angrily, \u201cNice kill! Do you know who did it? Have you found him? I will reward him. He did help me a lot! He has saved my precious time. How could I not reward him?\u201dThe three officers were all speechless and thought, \u201cWhy are we here with you if we have already found the murderer?\u201d\u201cPlease, my lord, tell me about the fight from that day in details. We will need to report it to the upper office.\u201d The officer smiled bitterly and finally told him of their purpose.\u201cReport? What report? You don\u2019t think I killed the guy, do you?\u201d Ye Xiao squinted his eyes, \u201cI did want to kill him badly, but somebody took it over\u2026 Humph, if the bastard wasn\u2019t dead yet, I must kill him myself!\u201dThe officers were left speechless again.Then they tried very hard to persuade him and the steward helped them a little bit, so Ye Xiao reluctantly described the details of what had happened that day. When he was describing how he punched Mu Cheng-Bai, he was in such high spirits that he actually stood up and started reliving the fight. He vividly showed them how he punched, kicked, dodged, jumped and landed on Mu Cheng-Bai\u2026He represented the story like it was an extremely wonderful duel between two supreme masters.All in all, he tried to depict a tale where he, lord Ye, had been fighting doggedly and unyieldingly and he was a super powerful, handsome and elegant world-class expert cultivator\u2026 while Mu Cheng-Bai had been beaten up like a drowning dog, and finally the great lord Ye had showed mercy to him and let him keep his pathetic little life\u2026Everyone felt like sweating when hearing his story!Who didn\u2019t know that he escaped, like a dog with his tail between his legs, from that fight?He was so shameless that he described himself like a great hero\u2026 They completely looked down on him within their hearts!\u201cI see\u2026 We understand it all now. We will report this to the upper office right now.\u201d The officer was so awkward that he asked to leave right away.\u201cHold on! What are you in a hurry for? I am not done yet\u2026\u201d Lord Ye was just on a roll. How could he let them get away?\u201cWe already have a clear picture about this whole ordeal\u2026 Lord Ye you are a diligent man, I think it is better for you to go and get some rest\u2026\u201d The officers then rushed out of the General\u2019s House, like escaping from death, while shouting, \u201cWe will have to bother you another time, young lord Ye\u2026\u201d\u201cUrh\u2026 Fine. Take care.\u201d Ye Xiao didn\u2019t move at all and was still lying on the chair.The servants let the three officers out and then everyone left the antechamber except for the steward.\u201cIt is so weird.\u201d The steward frowned, \u201cI thought that they would at least take you away for the investigation, but they actually just asked some questions here, in your house. Why would they operate like this\u2026\u201dYe Xiao humphed and said peacefully, \u201cIt is just the balance of political powers. Now the other princes are all grown up and every of them is eyeing the throne\u2026 There are two of them who are holding and developing powerful forces already in both the government and the martial clans\u2026 The crown prince is at the risk of losing his crown. How could he possibly mess with such a powerful military force like us, just for a dead brother-in-law?\u201d\u201cFurthermore, we have the kick-ass rumor spreading out there.\u201d The steward added and smiled.Ye Xiao nodded, \u201cTrue. For the crown prince\u2026 Mu Cheng-Bai was a brother-in-law when he was alive, but he is just a dead body now that he is dead. That\u2019s all\u2026 Hiahia, hiahiahia\u2026\u201dHe sneered and said no more, instead he went straight back to his backyard to continue his cultivation.\u201cSomething still doesn\u2019t feel right though\u2026\u201d The steward stopped smiling and murmured, \u201cThe crown prince surely wouldn\u2019t let this go so easily\u2026 Could there be another strike coming from him?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe spoke nervously with his hands clasped behind his back, \u201cThe message to the general should\u2019ve gotten through Huang-Long Guan and reached the desert by now. The message will get to the general in two days tops. And it will take at least another six days to get his reply\u2026 If anything goes wrong during these eight days\u2026\u201dHe sighed deeply and got out the room hurriedly. He told the guards to increase the security, especially at night, and to stay vigilant\u2026\u201cThose from the government may be restrained and scrupulous, but those from the martial clans\u2026 they are truly impossible to defend against effectively\u2026\u201d His eyes showed anxiety.\u201cThe next few months should be filled with chaotic events.\u201dThe steward who always showed a calm demeanor now felt his hands full of cold sweat. He truly felt insecure about keeping his young master safe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 27 \u2013 The Mystery In WhiteThe rumor was still causing unrest within the capital.But while all this was happening, an oddly isolated courtyard house seemed to be completely unaffected by the chaos outside.This courtyard house was located at the central area of the capital. It wouldn\u2019t be a lie if one was to say that in here an inch of land was worth a bar of gold.This courtyard house was built within a pervasive bamboo forest, which was surrounded by a small continuous mountain range on three sides. This meant that the house could only be approached from a single direction.People who could purchase such land must have very powerful background and an infinite amount of wealth. The person who did purchase it had actually turned twenty percent of the land into small mountains and seventy percent into a bamboo forest. And he had only used the remaining ten percent to build a sequestered courtyard house.The extravagant spending done by this person was really shocking!But using a fortune wisely almost always brings about a considerable return!In the courtyard, the wind was blowing gently causing the bamboo forest to peacefully rustle. Bringing about a sense of serenity, like a poetic illusion.At the moment, along with the wind in the forest, there was a distinct ringing sound from a string instrument; it was as if the sound was coming from from the heavens.The sound should have been contained within the heavens, but it was actually being heard in the mortal world!In the courtyard, there stood a zither on its stand. A man in a white robe was sitting in a wheelchair, and his fingers were dancing on the strings of the zither. The melodious sound of the zither was floating around like a gentle stream.A stick of incense was alight in front of the zither stand. Continuous caesious smoke was rising slowly and then circling in the air until it scattered.There were two girls in white standing behind the man.It looked like a wonderful painting, the three of them; one was sitting while two were standing in this beautiful scenery.Even if a large group of enemies came over right now, they would not have the heart to break this scene.The breeze was gently caressing their soft robes.Suddenly a figure in black with blue stripes flashed in the forest. A man crossed the forest like the wind and stepped on the floor ever so lightly. Although the man was moving peacefully, he must be in extreme haste, as he had moved very fast. However, when he saw the scene in front of him, he said nothing and stood aside silently. He didn\u2019t even make a sound when he breathed.He didn\u2019t dare to take deep breaths because he was afraid to disturb the peace of this scene.Although an unexpected individual had arrived, the man in white kept his calm demeanor. His face was fair like white jade. He looked lost in the music. His fingers were moving really fast but they seemed extremely comfortable on the zither. His eyes were nearly closed and his pretty eyebrows were naturally stretching to his sideburns. It looked like he hadn\u2019t noticed the man who had rushed through his forest and into his courtyard and was now standing in front of him.\u2013 Zeng! \u2013 Finally, the last note was heard, as the old man stopped playing the zither. Meanwhile, the magical music from the zither was still lingering around in the air.The man in white put his hand down slowly and took a deep breath. He closed his eyes and looked up, letting his long black hair sweep down naturally.The man in black stepped forward preparing to talk, but the man in white stretched his hand forward and waved lightly.The man in black humbly stepped back.After a long silence, the man in white opened his eyes and spoke peacefully, \u201cEverything in the universe has a soul. My zither stopped; it means that the soul of the song I was playing is gone. To feel the sound\u2019s soul connect with our souls\u2026 is respecting all livings\u2026 and is also respecting ourselves greatly.\u201d\u201cIt should not be interrupted at that moment.\u201d The man in white smiled peacefully, \u201cSo, no matter what emergent problems you have, you shall wait.\u201d\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d The man in black looked humbled as he lowered his head admiringly.This man in black had actually reached the peak of the Grade of Diyuan. Counting out the top-class cultivators in the superior martial sects, no cultivators in the mortal world could beat him, but he was actually acting like an inferior servant in front of the man in white.He acted so humble, but he looked to be in high spirits, sincere, and even honored!It seemed like, being a servant to this man in white, was the best thing and the biggest achievement of his life!\u201cNow you can talk.\u201d The man in white sat still and retracted his hand to his side with a smile, and then one of the girls handed him a white silk napkin. The man in white took the napkin and rubbed his hands before he handed it back.He didn\u2019t even look at the girl, but the girl was acting very humble as she took the napkin with both of her hands.\u201cIt is about Mu Cheng-Bai from the Mu clan. He has died in the capital and it is said that Ye Xiao did this. This case is still causing disturbances in the capital. The Mu clan has even sent out their strongest forces to Chen-Xing City for an investigation.\u201d The man in black said with his head low.\u201cHmm?\u201d The man in white put his hands on his belly and nodded.\u201cThere are many doubts in the case of Mu Cheng-Bai\u2019s death, but it is certain that the murderer can not be Ye Xiao! So\u2026 I am afraid that the Mu clan has fallen into a trap this time. Normally, the Mu clan are not outwitted to this extent\u2026\u201d The man in black reported, \u201cFirst of all, Ye Xiao is only a foppish fool who would never have the capability to kill Mu Cheng-Bai; let alone that there were two superior guards. It was impossible for him to kill three guys who were at the Grade of Renyuan\u2026 Secondly\u2026\u201dHe stated eight doubts along with his analysis, and every single one of them seemed very clear and reasonable.The man in white was listening silently the whole time until the man in black finished. And then he said, \u201cThey all sound reasonable\u2026\u201dThe man in black showed excitement in his face, and his face even turned a little red, \u201cThank you for your praise, my lord!\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d The man in white curled his mouth and smiled, \u201cEverything you said was based on one assumption. It is\u2026 that the murderer can not be Ye Xiao.\u201d\u201cIf the murderer really turns out to be Ye Xiao, everything you have said will become nonsense. And we may fall into the trap of taking endless risk because of this little mistake you may have made\u2026 You know why? Because if we don\u2019t consider Ye Xiao to be a suspect and he would actually turn out to be the murderer, then we would have investigated others for sure\u2026 Then we would never be able to find out who it was\u2026 And then what? Then we would keep suspecting one expert cultivator after another and make more and more enemies. We might insist that this was the logical thing to do, but even so, everyone we would offend would turn out to be innocent\u2026 That means that we would have created endless mortal enmities!\u201dThe man in white gazed at the man in black peacefully.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d The man in black was sweating, \u201cThis Ye Xiao is truly lame\u2026 Everyone knows it\u2026 It is a common opinion\u2026\u201d\u201cOh? Everyone knows it?\u201d The man in white smiled again, \u201cDoes a common opinion make it the truth? Do you really know about Ye Xiao\u2019s capabilities? Did you watch him grow up? Or have you tested him on your own?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026 No\u2026 I haven\u2019t.\u201d The man in black was stunned.\u201cSo, when Mu Cheng-Bai died, were you there and did you see the real murderer?\u201d The man in white was still smiling.\u201cWell\u2026 No\u2026\u201d The man in black was starting to feel small.\u201cWell then, how do you know Ye Xiao can or can not kill Mu Cheng-Bai and did or did not kill him?\u201d The man in white frowned.\u201c\u2026\u201d The man in black was left speechless.\u201cThere are only things which you haven\u2019t thought of; there is nothing you can\u2019t deal with. There are so many things you don\u2019t know about, and yet you have already made your judgment\u2026\u201d The man in white spoke peacefully, \u201cUnwise.\u201d\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d The man in black was completely drenched in sweat, \u201cYou are right, my lord.\u201d\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t Ye Xiao kill Mu Cheng-Bai? Why didn\u2019t he kill Mu Cheng-Bai? Why could Mu Cheng-Bai not die in a foppish fool\u2019s hand?\u201d The man in white raised his eyelids and spoke peacefully, \u201cThere is no absolute in our world. Even if the chance of him killing Mu Cheng-Bai is one percent or lower, that still doesn\u2019t make it impossible and it simply means, that he could actually be the murderer!\u201dIt was a little bit cryptic, but the man in black got the point.\u201cWell then\u2026 about this case, what should I do? Please, show me the right direction.\u201d The man in black kept his head low as he asked respectfully.\u201cAdd fuel to the fire.\u201d The man in white smiled softly, \u201cThe more people that die, the better. People from the Mu clan, people from the Crown Prince\u2019s Palace and people from the government\u2026 It doesn\u2019t matter how many of them die. But, Ye Xiao should stay alive.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026 Why?\u201d The man in black was totally confused.His master had just said that Ye Xiao was a suspect, so he had no idea why Ye Xiao couldn\u2019t die.\u201cIf Ye Xiao died, this case would be over. What happened would be tossed aside and it\u2019d be soon forgotten.\u201d The man in white sneered weirdly, \u201cIt is truly not a good situation to be at peace.\u201d\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d The man in black said.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWell, no matter who the Mu clan has sent this time, I want them all to die!\u201d The man in white smiled softly, \u201cThey can be killed by people from other clans, from the General\u2019s House, from where the princes stays or even from the martial sects\u2026 Hei-Jiu [1], do you understand?\u201d\u201cYes, my lord!\u201d The man in black \u2013 Hei-Jiu cupped his hands.\u201cBy the way\u2026 About collecting information from the large clans and the missions about the other two kingdoms and the grassland, how are you getting along?\u201d The man in white smiled softly and asked, \u201cI have waited an extra day already. Are you trying to keep me waiting?!\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..[1] Hei-Jiu : This name literally translates to Dark-nine. So this name should be something like a secret agent code name and is unlikely to be his actual name.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 28 \u2013 You Will Never Escape My Hatred\u201cI have already received some information.\u201d The man in black kept his head lowered and spoke nervously, \u201cOur men have already reached some sources and they are now following your instructions. Your plan is truly brilliant. It is only a matter of time before we hear some good news,\u201dThe man in white nodded, \u201cFair enough. I hope that you will not let me down.\u201dThe man in black was sweating profusely and answered loudly, \u201cWe won\u2019t let you down, my lord!\u201dThe man in white laughed and made a gesture. The girls behind him stepped forward and started to push the man\u2019s wheelchair to lead him away.This mysterious white robed man turned out to be a disabled person.\u201cMy lord, about Ye Xiao\u2026\u201d The man in black asked hurriedly.The man in white, who was sitting on the wheelchair, didn\u2019t even look back as he said, \u201cWhen the violent disturbance comes, we won\u2019t need Ye Xiao anymore, do we?\u201d\u201cYou are right.\u201d The man in black felt inspired.The man in white entered the house, which was located in the center of the courtyard house.Suddenly, shadows appeared and started quivering, and then \u2013 Puff! \u2013 the courtyard house suddenly vanished. In fact, the bamboo trees suddenly started to move like they could actually walk, and the countless bamboo trees had quickly covered every open space where the courtyard was mere seconds ago.Instantly, the open space, that was previously occupied by the courtyard house, became part of the bamboo forest. This place had actually fully integrated into the bamboo forest.A faint voice appeared and sighed, \u201cMy Camouflage Array of Inversing Five Elements is still imperfect\u2026 If only it could be soundproof\u2026 and keep the sound, smell and spiritual energy inside from being detected from the outside\u2026 it becomes the perfect Anti-location Array\u2026\u201d These words must\u2019ve originated from the mysterious man in white.One of the girls, Wan-Er spoke softly, \u201cMaster, the auction of the supreme dan beads\u2026\u201d\u201cGo!\u201d The man in white spoke gently, \u201cAt least get three beads back to me. Supreme dan beads with dan clouds is something that even I have never seen before.\u201dWan-Er was astonished, \u201cMaster, maybe there are less than three beads at the auction\u2026 Maybe there is only one bead.\u201d\u201cThere must be over three.\u201d The man in white said confidently.Their voices had now completely disappeared.The man in black crouched and then he flew up. He flew away and also disappeared.\u2026Since the conversation with the three officers, it had been rather quiet around Ye Xiao. Everything was moving along peacefully.Ye Xiao was free but he stayed at home. He was seizing every minute he had to cultivate with concentration. He was converting all the qi in his body into gelid qi to further improve his strength.During this time, he had found a pleasant surprise. The scorching qi that had appeared alongside the gelid qi didn\u2019t really disappear. Instead, it hid inside his Jing and Mai all over his body. Although it was weak, it still existed.In other words, the two kinds of qi that were brought by cultivating the East-rising Purple Qi were working together; one showed on the outside, while the other was quietly working on the inside. That also meant that the present level of East-rising Purple Qi contained two skills. He needed to practice both of them.Because of this, he worked even harder.He used to have some spare time in a day to drink some tea, but now he didn\u2019t want that anymore.He was either reading or cultivating. He was like the creme a la creme of a group of good students.The steward felt excited because of this. He thought that the young lord had finally grown up and had completely transformed. He felt that the general would be overjoyed if he were to see this\u2026The steward was right, but not in the way he had intended. His young master had indeed transformed, but in a different way!Zuo Wu-Ji and Lan Lang-Lang had come to Ye Xiao twice, but Ye Xiao had driven them away multiple times, \u201cPiss off! You foppish black sheep, don\u2019t disturb me from becoming a supreme cultivator. Go on with your own businesses!\u201dZuo Wu-Ji and Lan Lang-Lang felt speechless for his fanfaronade.\u201cSuch a bastard. He actually called himself a supreme cultivator\u2026\u201d\u201cHe must be daydreaming!\u201d\u201cI say he never woke up!\u201d\u201cI really want to punch him, but I fear that I can\u2019t beat him. We are no match for him even though he isn\u2019t a supreme cultivator, I am afraid\u2026\u201d\u201cHe\u2019ll beat the crap out of us!\u201d\u201cIt is fine that he daydreamed, but he actually dared to say we are foppish black sheep\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true. Like he isn\u2019t one of us\u2026\u201d\u201cWe obviously are in the same boat. Wasn\u2019t it the older one laughing at the younger?!\u201d\u201cOf course! We are the \u2018three lords\u2019. We are even walking side by side.\u201d\u201cHumph! The foppish fool, I will beat him up eventually.\u201d\u201cRight! We can\u2019t let him leave the glorious \u2018three lords\u2019.\u201d\u201cWait and see! Humph!\u201d\u201cHumph!\u201d\u2026It was possible to kick the two of them out of the house, but there was someone else that couldn\u2019t be driven away, no matter how hard Ye Xiao had tried.Most importantly, this one had a whip in her hand, which was purposely given by Ye Xiao\u2019s father to sexually discipline\u2026 Oh no, strictly discipline Ye Xiao.That\u2019s right! She was our adorable Princess Ye-Yue!Su Ye-Yue.Her dad was the only prince with a non-royal surname in the Kingdom of Chen. To be honored with the title of prince, he must have obtained great merits and should hold great power!He was Prince Hua-Yang who had three sons and a daughter. He didn\u2019t particularly care about his sons. Instead, his daughter Su Ye-Yue received all the care in his heart and was like an apple in his eye. Naturally the girl received special treatment, it seemed like her father feared that she was like something that would melt when he had it in his mouth and something that would drop when he held it in his hands. He truly spoiled her very much.It was said that when he named the girl, he gathered every single great scholar in his house to help him think about her name. Finally he took the concept of \u2018When the world revived, the moon shined in the night sky\u2019 so that it represented the surname and the given name perfectly [1].Thus, she got the name Su Ye-Yue.It was lucky that, even though Princess Ye-Yue was spoiled a lot, she didn\u2019t have an overbearing personality. It made it easier for Ye Xiao to accept her\u2026However, at the moment, all Ye Xiao could think of when she stared at him, was how he could quickly get as far away from her as possible.It was the feeling of a guilty conscience.This kind of guilt was technically from the experiences that he had obtained during his previous life.During his previous life, the Xiao Monarch was very powerful and had an unfathomable cultivation base. He laughed and was considered to be the most elegant within the firmament. However, he was cultivating the Pure Yang Martial Arts, so he stayed single in order to retain the purity of a male virgin.In his previous life, he had missed out on so many beautiful girls. And those girls had all deeply fallen in love with him\u2026But all that Ye Xiao could do was to watch them. So he always showed a cold-hearted and uninterested look in his eyes, which had hurt more girls than he could count.When they left him despairingly, one after another, Ye Xiao could only turn his back on them and sigh deeply in his heart.Now that Su Ye-Yue, his legal fianc\u00e9e, was looking at him with her beautiful eyes, Ye Xiao felt his heart racing.He nearly ran away because of his usual practices.In fact, there was another girl\u2019s face showing in his mind \u2013 a girl with beautiful and sad eyes. It was like her face popped up blocking his sight and looking at him with tears of love and mourning.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dYe Xiao reached out his hand and murmured.But he was only able to say one word before he recovered from the trance. He laughed at himself and showed a little loneliness on his face.\u2026It was in the Qing-Yun Realm.There was a palace with clouds and fog floating in the air. It was silent and solemn.In the backyard of the grand palace, there was a grave that looked new.An entire piece of Qing-Yun Purple Jade that was three-meters wide and ten meters high was used as a gravestone! A piece of Qing-Yun Purple Jade, which would make countless people fight for it was actually just being used as a simple gravestone!A sword light suddenly flashed rapidly.Purple sparks bursting out on the surface of the Qing-Yun Purple Jade!Some broken tiny pieces of the jade fell on the floor.Six words appeared, which were carved deeply on the gravestone.\u201c\u7b11\u5c3d\u5929\u4e0b\u82f1\u96c4!\u201d (To laugh at all heroes in the firmament!)That sword light stopped immediately. The owner of the sword sighed and turned around to leave for the room on the top floor of the palace, and as she moved, she quickly disappeared from view.It was in this room.A girl that had a perfect slim body and was wearing a silk veil on her face silently admired the calligraphy on the wall for a long time, until she eventually closed her beautiful eyes. Two lines of tears coursed down her cheeks.\u201cI will avenge you!\u201d\u201cEven though you never admitted you were my husband, but\u2026 I have decided to be your wife! I would stick with you ceaselessly if you were still alive and I will avenge you if you die!\u201d\u201cNow that you are dead, how do you say \u2018no\u2019 to me? Could you actually stop me widowing myself? Ye Xiao, you bastard! I hate you! I hate you! I will hate you in all of my next lives!\u201dShe might have said something with hate, but more tears were quickly dropping down from her eyes to the floor. The sword that was stabbing in the floor was quivering, like it was going along with its master\u2019s emotions of love and hate, like it was eager for a piquant killing!On the wall, there was not only the sword, but also the calligraphy. The beautiful girl was looking at the calligraphy lovingly.The writing on the calligraphy was like a flying dragon and dancing birds; it showed unrestraint.The main lines were:\u2018\u4e00\u751f\u60e7\u89c1\u7ea2\u989c\u6cea\uff1b\u8c28\u614e\u83ab\u4f24\u7f8e\u4eba\u5fc3\uff1b\u5f85\u5230\u98d8\u7136\u6d88\u5931\u65e5\uff0c\u5316\u4f5c\u5929\u8fb9\u4e0d\u7f81\u4e91\uff01\u2019(To escape from the tear of the beauty; to prevent hurting her heart. When the death comes one day, to turn into an unrestrained cloud!)There was a smaller line below,\u2018\u4eca\u751f\u6709\u6094\uff0c\u5bb3\u4f60\u5f62\u5355\u5f71\u53ea\uff1b\u82e5\u6709\u6765\u751f\uff0c\u8bb8\u4f60\u56db\u6d77\u516b\u8352\u3002\u2019(I regret, that I let you be solitary; if there is a next life, I promise I will accompany you to travel the world.)The name of the author inscribed was \u2018\u53f6\u7b11\u2019 (Ye Xiao).The girl in white looked at the calligraphy with tears in her eyes, and felt inconsolable, \u201cYou liar! You promised me your next life! There is no such thing!\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t want to hurt a girl\u2019s heart, but you have already hurt me so much!\u201d\u201cYou wanted to become an unrestrained cloud when you died\u2026 Now that you are dead, where is my unrestrained cloud, huh?\u201d\u201cLiar! Liar! Liar! You are a terrible liar!\u201dShe turned around and laid her head and arms on the table, once again started to wail.\u201cToday is your first seven [2]. I will wear mourning attire for you for seventy-five days and stay here to keep your grave for a year.\u201d The girl stood up slowly and wiped her tears, murmuring, \u201cAfter a year, I will carry my sword to avenge you! With such hatred, I will never let them go unless I die!\u201d\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you unwell?\u201d Su Ye-Yue saw that Ye Xiao was lost in his own world, so she reached her hand out and waved it in front of him, \u201cHey, don\u2019t make such a terrible look. What are you doing?\u201dYe Xiao hurriedly drew back his mind, struck a decent pose and coughed, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\u2014\u2014-[1] About her name Su Ye-Yue, the surname is Su and the given name is Ye-Yue. Su (\u82cf) can represent \u2018revive\u2019 (\u590d\u82cf), and Ye-Yue (\u591c\u6708) means the moon (\u6708) at night (\u591c).[2] First seven: It is believed in China that when people die, the soul will come back at the seventh day after their death, and the family will prepare meals for them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 29 \u2013 Humph! You Are So Annoying~!\u201cHmm? Can\u2019t I come?\u201d Su Ye-Yue got a little angry when she heard Ye Xiao. She wrinkled her little pretty nose and said, \u201cSooner or later, it will become my house too! I will be the vice-chairman here! I am here to check my residence in advance! Can\u2019t I do that? Listen to you. You don\u2019t want me to be here from deep within your heart, do you?\u201dShe humphed and started to twist the whip in her hands. She squinted at Ye Xiao with a look like \u2018I will whip you to death, if you ever dare to piss me off again\u2019.She intentionally showed a dark look to Ye Xiao, but it turned out to be so adorable that he didn\u2019t even feel the least bit threatened.He had not been in the mood, but she had actually amused him. The words she said, \u2018will become my house too\u2019, \u2018the vice-chairman\u2019, \u2018check my residence in advance\u2019\u2026 he found them really funny.As she had behaved like this, maybe Su Ye-Yue actually didn\u2019t feel any antipathy towards Ye Xiao. Maybe she had already given in to her fate, so she cared no more about it, but it revealed her true personality.\u201cHeyyy, what are you talking about?\u201d Ye Xiao tried to comfort her, \u201cHow could I possibly not welcome you? I am super happy that you came to my house. Oh no, our house.\u201d\u201cHumph!\u201d Su Ye-Yue acted like the boss of the house and walked around Ye Xiao, holding her head high with her wrinkled nose, and then she snuffled a bit and asked interestedly, \u201cOh, Xiao-Xiao, how come you smell so good? What are you carrying with you?!\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? I don\u2019t have anything on me!\u201d Ye Xiao contested her claims, but he knew clearly about the origin of his pleasant fragrance.The reason why he smelled so good was quite simple. He had accomplished ablution of the muscles and bones twice with his body, so most of the impurities in his body had been cleared. His body was pure like a newborn child\u2019s body, so it certainly smelled good.\u201cYes! You definitely do!\u201d Su Ye-Yue was quite certain about this fact, as she took a closer look at Ye Xiao and smelled him around. Then she murmured with confusion, \u201cIt is not the smell of perfumes for girls\u2026 And it is not the smell of a flower\u2026 and\u2026 Oh? Oh!!\u201dShe found that she was too close to Ye Xiao, and then she looked up and saw Ye Xiao looking at her with a complacent smile. The pretty face and his soft eyes were really close to her. She could even feel his breath!She was so shocked that she screamed. She immediately jumped away from him and felt her heart racing. Her pretty face turned red. She suddenly felt awkward and didn\u2019t know what to do. She was flustered and embarrassed at the same time. She would have liked to turn around and run out of the house, but she found herself unable to move her legs. Instead, she realized that she would rather stay here than leave.Ye Xiao felt warmth spreading in his heart, and said softly, \u201cWhat an adorable little girl.\u201dSu Ye-Yue felt her face quickly heating up as her original beautiful pale white skin quickly obtained a deep shade of red. She managed to stutter out a few words, \u201cY\u2026 you\u2026 you\u2026 you are just slightly older than me! Humph, how dare you speak to me with a tone of seniority! I\u2026 If you\u2026 y\u2026 you speak like that again, I\u2026 I\u2026 I wi\u2026 will punch you down!\u201dYe Xiao laughed out loud carelessly. He felt pleased from the bottom of his heart.Hearing his voice and smelling his scent made Su Ye-Yue\u2019s heart beat even faster. The blush on her face didn\u2019t vanish; it became even more obvious and cute.She suddenly came out with a thought that this guy was to become her husband in the future\u2026He was to become her husband\u2026This thought had appeared in her mind and was actually lingering around for a long time. She just couldn\u2019t help but feel even more embarrassed.Before now, Su Ye-Yue had simply regarded Ye Xiao as her playmate and a man she had been loathly engaged to. Their fates were intertwined because she couldn\u2019t disobey her parents. That was it and that was all.However, at this moment, the thought of him becoming her \u2018husband\u2019 that appeared in her mind had truly surprised this vivacious girl.She lowered her head and stayed quiet for quite a while. When she finally raised her head, she found that Ye Xiao was now sitting on the chair across her and that he was actually focussing on reading a book.She finally felt relaxed and felt lucky that he didn\u2019t seem to notice her.But she couldn\u2019t help but be a little bit upset as well. She was wondering why he wasn\u2019t looking at her at all.Then she took a few steps ahead and softly sat in front of him, and observed his pretty face. A long time passed in the silence.After reading the book for a while, Ye Xiao stopped to rest and only now realized that Su Ye-Yue actually hadn\u2019t left. He looked up and saw that she was laying her elbows on the table and bracing her lower jaw. She was looking at him quietly and calmly.He felt puzzled, and asked gently, \u201cAre you ok?\u201dMaybe because Ye Xiao had spoken gently, she wasn\u2019t startled. She was still calm, and a little bit absent-minded as she murmured, \u201cXiao-Xiao\u2026 You have changed a lot recently\u2026\u201d\u201cI have changed a lot? Have I?\u201d Ye Xiao frowned.\u201cYes\u2026 Yes, you have\u2026\u201d She tilted her head and thoughtfully said, \u201cYour outer appearance hasn\u2019t changed\u2026 But you used to be very annoying, which made me want to punch you down all the time\u2026 As for now\u2026 the annoying part is gone\u2026 Instead, you are\u2026\u201dShe frowned and tried to organize proper words to clearly describe her feelings. After a while she continued, \u201c\u2026like\u2026 You are composed and credible now\u2026 Why is that? And you look like you have many things hidden in your mind, like there are so many stories in your head\u2026 That is weird.\u201dYe Xiao lifted his eyebrows and smiled.Changed? Of course he had changed! It would be weird if he had not.If this Ye Xiao was still the departed Ye Xiao, not the Xiao Monarch, that would be a massive problem!Anyway, he had to admit that girls\u2019 instincts are really frightful.Su Ye-Yue was a princess, so things that usually happened to normal girls would never happen to her. However, the annoyance she had felt in the departed Ye Xiao was the natural reaction of every normal girl had towards the foppish fools.Ye Xiao realized that sometimes even a tiny action could let people notice his changed personality. He felt that he really needed to seriously think about this.He had always been free and alone in his previous life, traveling around the world with laughter.However, everything was different now. If he showed the personality of the Xiao Monarch in this present life\u2026 people would wonder how he turned into a solitary man from a foppish teenage boy\u2026Even in this mortal world, there could be people who would regard him as a threat and were able to easily kill him.Maybe he should show himself as a foppish fool in people\u2019s faces, so that it could become his perfect disguise.Besides, after living for such a long time, Ye Xiao clearly knew that he had mostly lived wrong in his previous life.Every bit of affection he had received had actually made him understand, but he actually felt like he understood nothing.He was always confused about it.Could it be\u2026 that he had to go through all the troubles in heaven and hell before he could become successful?So he was thinking, \u201cMaybe I should try to get into a relationship?\u201dThe reason he had stayed away from relationships till now was due to him practicing the Pure Yang Martial Arts.\u201cThe disturbance you have caused this time is really serious. Although you didn\u2019t kill Mu Cheng-Bai, but all of the existing evidences are pointing at you.\u201d Su Ye-Yue expressed her anxiousness.Su Ye-Yue had not cared about this case before, because she had not thought that it would matter whether Ye Xiao would die or not; she would have probably felt nothing more than a little pity. However, she cared for him now.Even she herself didn\u2019t know how and why her mind had changed.Someone she hadn\u2019t cared about before, had suddenly become important to her. How?!\u201cYou\u2019re in a truly dangerous situation.\u201d She lovingly looked at Ye Xiao.\u201cHmm. I know.\u201d Ye Xiao nodded, \u201cI am afraid I really am getting into a perilous position\u2026 The princes are fighting for the throne; the noble clans are interfering; the supreme dan beads have shown up; the reclusive martial sects are back to the world\u2026 The thing regarding me has happened during all these events, so maybe I will be the blasting fuse to the bursts of the battles\u2026\u201d\u201cThat is true\u2026 What will you do next?\u201d Su Ye-Yue asked worriedly, \u201cI can ask my dad to send a team of guards to protect you and lead you out of the capital to the north. You can get away from this mess.\u201dYe Xiao replied after thinking for a while, \u201cA man should stand straight up in the world. How can I keep escaping from troubles. The more dangerous the situation is, the more I can get trained. If I can get through this, it will definitely be a reform of me. A danger is also an opportunity. If I can\u2019t get through it\u2026 then there won\u2019t be any big accomplishments in my life. I will be a useless fool who is unable to protect the one who he cares for and who cares for him.\u201dYe Xiao smiled, \u201cI am too young. I haven\u2019t been through anything that will make me regret when I die. So if I die, I die.\u201dWhen he said so, he suddenly thought of a pair of eyes he had seen before, which looked exactly the same like the eyes that were looking at him right now.He felt sad. Then he sighed.Su Ye-Yue\u2019s face suddenly turned red again.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euShe started to think,\u201cWhat\u2026 What does he mean? Of course, the \u2018Get through this\u2019 part is understandable. The \u2018can\u2019t get through\u2019 part\u2026 The one who he cares for and who cares for him\u2026 Who is the one he was talking about? \u2018Too young\u2019, \u2018haven\u2019t been through anything that\u2026\u2019 What was he talking about? Could it be\u2026 Could it be me?\u201dShe suddenly felt the accompaniment of gongs and drums in her mind that her heart nearly beat out from her chest. She felt shyness, happiness and sweetness at the same time. She tried her best to humph strongly, in case she got ludicrous, and then she spoke like a peevish child, \u201cOh, come on. This has nothing to do with me, I guess\u2026 Oh, you are just talking nonsense again\u2026 Come on! I am leaving. I won\u2019t hear your balderdash.

When he opened his eyes, Su Ye-Yue was no longer around. He could only hear a shy voice, \u201cLittle Soya [1]! Let\u2019s go! Let\u2019s get out of the house of the man who speaks honeyed words\u2026\u201dShe had managed to escape from his clutches.He heard the guards talk, but he couldn\u2019t make out what they were talking about, and then they stopped.\u201cYes of course\u2026 This has nothing to do with her\u2026 I never said that it did\u2026 (dialogue continued from chapter 29)\u201d Ye Xiao rubbed his head and murmured, \u201cWhy did she suddenly become shy and run away\u2026 What\u2019s wrong with her?\u201dHe was confused and murmured, \u201cOh girls\u2026 Their thoughts are truly baffling\u2026\u201dThe steward came over in a hurry and noticed that Su Ye-Yue had left. He felt relieved and grabbed onto Ye Xiao\u2019s arm, \u201cMy lord! People from the Mu clan have reached the entrance of the capital! They are now doing the blood sacrifice outside the south gate. It is said that\u2026 They are holding 77 white flags and 22 blood flags in total!\u201dYe Xiao was confused, \u201cBlood sacrifice? White flags? Blood flags? What the hell are those?\u201dThe steward was in such a hurry that he stomped his foot out of frustration before answering, \u201cYou don\u2019t know? It is a \u2018ninety-nine\u2019! The 77 white flags mean mourning and the 22 blood flags mean that they are unwilling to give up! There are 99 flags in total, and that means they will never consider any compromise! No matter how long it will take, they are unwilling to give up!\u201dYe Xiao rolled his eyelids, \u201cSo what?\u201dHearing Ye Xiao\u2019s words, the steward became dumbfounded.Ye Xiao stretched himself leisurely, \u201cTime for bed\u2026 Words like \u2018unwilling to give up\u2019 sound really horrible. I am so scared and it makes me feel sleepy\u2026 I am so terrified\u2026 So I think I need to sleep so as to hide from reality.\u201dThe steward was shocked as he watched his young master leave leisurely. He was rendered speechless and felt like there was a storm howling in his mind. When he was just considering forgetting about their relationship and beating Ye Xiao up, Ye Xiao had already closed the door in his face. After a while, snoring sounds resounded throughout the mansion\u2026\u201cI am truly\u2026\u201d The steward couldn\u2019t find words to complete this sentence. He was extremely worried but he couldn\u2019t do a thing about it, so he finally stomped his feet on the floor and then left.\u2026It was deep into the night.The steward had stayed awake the entire time.The capital was enshrouded in a tense atmosphere at this moment.However, nobody knew that in a vast bamboo forest, there was a man with a clear sight quietly observing the capital.It seemed that all the birds in the capital were arriving at this forest to set up their nests. The birds flew to the bamboo forest from all directions one after another. The silent bamboo forest had turned unusually noisy.The man in white waved his hand quietly and those birds all gathered in the sky over his head.They didn\u2019t just keep flying. Instead, they stopped on his hand one after another. It was truly a marvelous spectacle. The birds left small wax beads in his hand one after another.\u201cMaster, you should get some rest. Just let Xiu-Er and me do this job.\u201d A girl in white walked over lightly and spoke softly.\u201cIt\u2019s better I do it myself when I am able to.\u201d The man in white smiled softly, \u201cWan-Er, you two must be tired after all these years. You should relax sometimes. Don\u2019t worry. Such an easy job won\u2019t exhaust me. Besides, to do some works is a way for me to practice. It is good for me.\u201dWan-Er smiled, \u201cAs long as you stay with us, we won\u2019t feel tired. I understand that you want to practice more, but your legs\u2026 We are worried about you.\u201dThe man in white smiled peacefully, \u201cIt is my unavoidable fate. Everything will be ok and I just need to get over it. This period of time is actually the perfect time for me to improve myself. It affects my ultimate mission which I have to complete in the future. Don\u2019t worry. I will be fine. I have gotten over it long ago\u2026 really!\u201d\u201cOk.\u201d Wan-Er replied with a sweet smile, and then she covered him in the pure white cotton cloak which she had brought.As she was preparing to leave, the man in white spoke to her in a low voice, \u201cWan-Er, do you notice that the name \u2018Ye Xiao\u2019 sounds odd?\u201d\u201cOdd?\u201d Wan-Er frowned.She thought that his question was weird. The word was especially weird \u2013 \u2018odd\u2019!\u201cYou may not know about it. This name is very interesting.\u201d The man in white smiled peacefully and spoke as if deep in his thoughts, \u201cWhat a pity\u2026\u201dHis eyes slightly rolled up and he looked into the distant sky through the bamboo trees. After a long time, he sighed, \u201cWhat a pity!\u201d\u201cA pity?\u201d Wan-Er was confused and her crystal-like eyes were wide-open.But the man stopped his daydreaming so that he could read the information attentively.\u201cThe first storm will soon reach the capital\u2026 And will also be the first storm of my life\u2026\u201d The man in white murmured, \u201cWho could experience the storms of the world with me by my side?\u201dHe looked really lonely, as if the loneliness was from extracted from the bottom of his heart. A sense of coldness had formed within him.It was the kind of coldness felt when one was at the top of the world, a coldness that nobody else could withstand.He said to Wan-Er, \u201cLet the Nine Black-dressers [2] stay focussed on every movement in the General\u2019s House. If something goes wrong, make sure they do any -and everything necessary!\u201dWan-Er quickly agreed and left.\u2026The city was meant to be bustling tonight.A lot of people entered the Chen-Xing City through every entrance!People from the martial sects, the unattached cultivators and the tyrants from everywhere were all quietly making their way to the city.The security in the house of Ye was strengthened.After the princess left, eight guards had arrived from the Palace of Hua-Yang. They\u2019d joined the security group immediately after arrival.The steward was well prepared. He had actually brought a bizarre knife with him.The 36 blood guards felt surprised when they saw the knife. They looked at each other and found nothing to say. These guards, who usually expressed no emotions, were unexpectedly showing their excitement.They hadn\u2019t seen the God-Slayer\u2019s Knife for so many years. This night\u2026 would certainly become an interesting night for them.The night had fallen and the sky was at its darkest.The whole capital was enshrouded by the darkness.But the darkness tonight was different from the usual one. There was a depressing feeling contained inside it, which had quickly spread all over the capital.Tonight, even the common people could sense the danger in the air. They all closed their windows and had gone to bed early.The royal guards sensed it too, even though they had no idea what was actually going on. They paid more attentions tonight, like there were horrible enemies coming for them.It was finally midnight.It was silent in Ye Xiao\u2019s room. The snoring had stopped. It seemed like he was deeply asleep.The steward sighed and murmured, \u201cHe actually sleeps like he is dead. Oh my good lord. Should I say that you are unperturbed like an experienced general\u2026 or heartless like a hoodlum? Gosh\u2026\u201dHe truly felt that he was unable to see through this young lord\u2019s heart.The young lord was sometimes smart with personal control, but mostly he was just a foppish lad, a fool \u2013 a complete fool!In the sky, the wind howled weirdly.The steward stood on the roof of the house and saw some figures flying over.The white belt on those figures\u2019 waists were obvious, even dazzling in the dark.The steward narrowed his eyes.He felt the white color to be too dazzling.The crown prince did stop the actions considering the fight for the throne, but he had allowed the Mu clan to deal with Ye Xiao independently. It actually became more troublesome for the Ye clan.People from the Mu clan were obviously crazy. They didn\u2019t care whether Ye Xiao was the true murderer or not. Neither did they care whether Ye Xiao had the capability to kill Mu Cheng-Bai or not.They cared about nothing.They simply wanted to kill Ye Xiao!It was totally unreasonable.What was even more unreasonable was that they were actually going through with it; they were actually trying to kill Ye Xiao tonight!The steward was absolutely livid. And the people who were getting closer now had proven this fact. The Mu clan had been standing high above the masses for so long that they treated people like ants which they could kill freely without any consequences\u2026From each direction of the east, the south, the west and the north, there were two figures flying over, and they were about to step on the bounding wall of the General\u2019s House.The steward yelled, \u201cWho are you? Halt, all of you! You are not allowed to violate the territory of the General\u2019s House!\u201dA sneering laughter came from the west. A man in the west side said, \u201cWhere is the foppish lad? Tell him to come out and prepare for death! We will just think of this as a food taken at night.\u201d Harsh laughter penetrated the General Ye\u2019s house.For the Mu clan, which was one of the eight noble clans, to fight against a general\u2019s family was definitely an easy job. They didn\u2019t have any respect for them at all.These men might not be the main force of the Mu clan, because the Ye clan was not strong enough to warrant the use of their main force. But these men were more than strong enough to play the bullies in the capital.The steward was furious and spoke with a cold voice, \u201cYou are here to have some food late at night, right? You have to know that the food in our place requires one to have strong teeth. It would be a shame if you guys get your teeth broken!\u201dThe man replied with a sneer, \u201cMy teeth are steel-like. It is just a trivial Northern General\u2019s House. What could be so tough that could break my teeth!\u201d He waved his hand and shouted, \u201cGo! Go get our food!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d The other seven men answered at the same time.The next moment, the seven figures turned into seven sword lights. The lights suddenly flashed in the sky and flew fast into the house.The steward\u2019s pupils constricted at once and he shouted his orders, \u201cStop them!\u201dThe 36 blood guards who had been waiting for a long time answered affirmatively to the steward and immediately prepared to fly up to start the sanguinary fight!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euTheir enemies were from the famous Mu clan. Although they were not the core force of the Mu clan, they were still extraordinary fighters. The steward and the guards really felt insecure about this battle, but none of them ever thought of backing off!However, the next moment, everyone was stunned by what happened!\u2014\u2014[1] Little Soya: It must be the name of Su Ye-Yue\u2019s pet \u2013 it may be a dog or a cat.[2] Nine Black-dressers: It seems there are nine men in black, and Hei-Jiu must be one of them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, there were more than the expected 36 voices which had sounded out.When the 36 blood guards were preparing to take actions, seven figures popped up from different corners in the yard without any warning. The blood guards could not even react to their sudden appearance.Sword lights flashed like lightning.All the participants from both sides were stunned. The steward was the most shocked amongst them all.The rage which had shown on his face had turned into extreme astonishment! His lower jaw had dropped to the floor. His mouth was hanging wide enough to swallow an entire rabbit!Where did the seven men, who had suddenly shown up, come from?They were definitely not the guards of the General\u2019s House; neither were they the guards from the Palace of Hua-Yang!However, they rushed out fearlessly right after the steward had shouted out the order!Who were they?The events that took place in the following moments had left everyone extremely astonished. There would be nothing more shocking than what they were witnessing!They saw the sword lights flashing in the air as the seven masked men rushed toward the eight Mu clan assassins!Swords rose up and then they slashed down in the blink of an eye!\u2013 Chop chop chop \u2026-Seven heads were sent spinning in the air, decapitated!The men from the Mu clan had come with fierceness and confidence, but in just a flash, seven of them had already died! And they had all died within a span of a few seconds!Facing the seven masked men of unknown backgrounds, the so-called expert cultivators of the Mu clan had been unable to even raise their swords in defence.The seven men who just died had flown over smartly, but ended up being chopped into halves. The entire ambush had taken less than a second to pan out!Everyone had become petrified!The 36 blood guards looked at the blood spraying in the air, completely clueless. They had no idea what was going on as they simply stood there like idiots. Even the most experienced of the lot, the steward, remained rooted to the spot.Suddenly, he realized something, and this \u2018something\u2019 was not the joy obtained from the deaths of their enemies. He thought, \u201cDamn it! We were framed!\u201dThese men who came from nowhere had killed seven of the Mu clan men with a single strike and they truly had no good intentions.What would have been seen by everyone would be that, after the steward had given the order, the seven masked men came out and killed the Mu clan men.That meant that the seven men from the Mu clan were killed because of his order!The Mu clan and the Ye clan would become foes after this, even if the suspicion for Mu Cheng-Bai\u2019s death was to be lifted away from Ye Xiao!As for now, nobody could do anything to stop the two clans from being foes!The steward was absolutely livid.When he looked at the blood guards, he found that they were actually looking at him with eyes filled with worship and shock!\u201cSuper!\u201d Someone shouted.The steward nearly spit out blood\u2026 he thought, \u201c\u2018Super\u2019 your ass! Are things not bad enough for your? Can\u2019t you use your brains? We were framed!\u201dIn front of him, stood the leader of the seven dead guys. He was the only one left alive in his team. He was stunned and felt fear creep into his mind.He was completely panicking, \u201cWhat the hell! Is this really just a general\u2019s house? Is it really a general\u2019s house of the mortal world? Are you fxxking kidding me? My men wouldn\u2019t just be killed so easily even if we were fighting the Royal Palace guards! Well even if they were killed, they would never get killed in an instant! They could have at least given a decent fight, right? They actually got chopped up like they were vegetables! They were killed so easily! This is impossible\u2026\u201dIt was a fabulous instant extermination!\u201cThe house of Ye! I will remember this!\u201d The man immediately flew back to escape after recovering from his initial shock.Since the masked men could kill all his underlings so easily, he definitely would be unable to beat any of them!He was afraid that, if he had decided to leave any later, he would lose his own life too.So the only thing he wanted to do now was to get out of here as soon as possible; he wanted nothing more than keep his life!One could only do something when one stayed alive; that\u2019s what he believed!He had already flown back several meters and had almost made his getaway, but at this moment, a sharp sword light suddenly flashed again. The shiny blade of the sword had pierced his back and had come out of his chest, skewering him. It was covered in blood.A look of despair showed up in his eyes and he looked back.Another masked man was standing behind him. Nobody could comprehend how he had reached there so quickly. His eyes were cold and he slowly drew his sword back. He then spoke peacefully, \u201cYou have already come all this way. Why leave so soon?\u201dThe leader of the dead guys stared at him and blood flowed out of his mouth. His body feebly fell down on the roof.The masked man swung his sword again, even before the escaping man had touched the floor and \u2013 chop -, the head was chopped off!The masked man then raised his foot and kicked the dead body down to the ground and said chillingly, \u201cOne hit; two parts!\u201dThe next moment, all of the eight masked men had jumped on the boundary wall.The steward seemed to emerge from his reverie and ran forward shouting, \u201cWho are you? Why do you frame us?!\u201dThe eight masked men replied with silence and flew out of sight immediately.They didn\u2019t even want to speak to the steward.Watching the eight of them disappear into the night, looking at the eight dead bodies and smelling the blood in the air, the steward was totally stunned speechless.They really were framed this time, and no escape was in sight.They wouldn\u2019t even have a chance to explain.The 36 blood guards showed up from the darkness and gathered around the steward. They were delighted.\u201cHey boss, I admire you sincerely! So cool! So overwhelming! Eight bastard\u2019s heads got chopped off just because of one simple order\u2026\u201d\u201cYo boss! That was awesome\u2026\u201d\u201cHey boss\u2026\u201d\u201cShut the fxxk up! All of you!\u201d The steward drew a long face and tried hard not to freak out, \u201cWe just got framed! You foolish lubbers! In your brains there is nothing but muscles, you morons\u2026 What was so delightful? Gosh\u2026\u201dHe stamped and went to find Ye Xiao.The steward awkwardly realized that in this place, the only person he could actually talk to was the foppish young master of his, who actually was the one who had caused all this mess!When he reached Ye Xiao\u2019s room, he found it to be unoccupied.He had noticed quite a while ago that the snoring had stopped, which had made him believe that the young master was just sleeping soundly. Had Ye Xiao already left by then?The steward didn\u2019t believe it to be true, so he looked all over the house to find him. However, even after searching every corner of the house, he didn\u2019t find any trace of Ye Xiao.There wasn\u2019t any sign of a struggle , so the steward knew that Ye Xiao, at least, was not kidnapped.But where could he have gone?The steward was left wondering,\u201dHow a foppish young lord could leave without leaving a trace?\u201dThen he realized he had no time to think of such tough questions, so he just sighed.\u201cOh my dear lord. Why are you still fooling around at this troubled time? Don\u2019t you know people are all aiming for your life? Why are you still\u2026\u201dIt was so ridiculous!Now the General\u2019s House was in a big mess and they had been framed, and big trouble would head in their direction. Why did he still go out?Was it not perilous enough for him?!\u2026Well the steward was wrong about Ye Xiao!In fact, Ye Xiao had been in the house all along and had watched everything that had happened in this weird fight.When those men from the Mu clan arrived, Ye Xiao was preparing to take actions.He did know that he might expose himself if he struck out, but he also knew that everyone in this house would die if he didn\u2019t.Oh of course, except this unfathomable steward.However, when the masked guys showed up and killed seven of the Mu clan warriors in one strike, Ye Xiao stopped and stayed silent. His eyes lit up!Why are they doing this?Ye Xiao knew the answer clearly and he didn\u2019t need to ask about it. It was quite obvious to him!Ye Xiao only had one question \u2013 who were these men?When he was thinking about it, he had already moved out of his room through the window. He sneaked to the yard and waited, hidden in a shadow.He thought that those masked men would definitely go back to their base, so he decided to wait here, so as to follow them secretly when they left!He was curious,\u201cI wonder who else would want to mess with me in the capital!\u201dYe Xiao was right. The eight masked men left quickly after they successfully framed the Ye clan, and then \u2013 swish! swish! swish!\u2026- they flew over Ye Xiao\u2019s head.Ye Xiao held his breath and waited for some time to pass. He knew that it would be unwise to follow them right away.He had noticed that there were still a lot of people who were hiding around the house. If he showed up rashly, he would definitely expose himself!And he was right. After the eight masked men disappeared, dozens of figures flew out from around the house and left towards their own destinations. These guys were obviously people from other forces who had come to check the situation here.\u201cSome people just came to me directly while more people were just watching us fighting against each other.\u201d Ye Xiao sighed.After a while, from a dark corner inside the house, a figure rushed out and flew up. Puff! The figure disappeared from eyesight in just a blink.Ye Xiao had noticed this figure as he had a pair of keen eyes. Then he decided to take action.He had decided to follow this person from the shadows, and while following him, Ye Xiao\u2019s appearance had changed drastically.Ye Xiao now had a much larger frame and was a head shorter than normal.That\u2019s right! He had decided that the appearance of Feng Zhi-Ling, who he had played when was selling the supreme dan beads to the salesroom, would serve him wonderfully on this occasion.He flew in the night sky like a ghost. His speed seemed to be faster than a typhoon, but his posture wasn\u2019t affected by the howling wind at all.It was another one of his exclusive skills.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe Lunisolar Shadow!Coming like a stream while leaving like the wind.

Ye Xiao had obtained the scroll of Lunisolar Shadow after he had killed a one-footed robber in the Qing-Yun Realm. The robber had just reached the mystical Grade of Daoyuan. But it had actually taken Ye Xiao, who was at the peak of the Grade of Daoyuan at that time, an entire month to track him down!If the robber had not eventually exhausted himself, Ye Xiao might not have been able to catch him.After Ye Xiao took the scroll of Lunisolar Shadow from the robber\u2019s dead body, he came to know that the Lunisolar Shadow was truly something outstanding!The most wonderful thing about this skill was that he could use it to conceal himself instantly and then flee away as per his convenience!Such a miraculous skill was truly something that could keep him safe under any circumstance. Moreover, using it only cost a tiny bit of his energy, which made it unreasonably powerful!Ye Xiao had mastered this skill only after he had spent a lot of time to practice. But, in spite of all these benefits, this was the first time that he had been forced to use it.The Xiao Monarch had been so powerful that he did not even have to hide from anyone. He had never been in a situation in which he had been forced to use this skill, that is, until now!Ye Xiao had been diligently following this man. The man seemed very cautious and kept changing directions at unexpected intervals. Maybe, he had felt that something was wrong. In fact, he had changed no less than fifteen times.When daybreak came, he actually stopped and stood still. He kept looking around for fifteen minutes until he finally chose a direction and shot off without any warning.Ye Xiao was caught off guard.The man\u2019s cultivation level should be around the 6th rank of the Grade of Diyuan. Although Ye Xiao was not strong enough to perform the Lunisolar Shadow perfectly, he could still conceal himself to a satisfying extent. But the man really had a superior spiritual sense!Ye Xiao kept following the man at a distance of about three hundred yards. He usually kept a distance of a hundred yards while shadowing people , but he wasn\u2019t strong enough at the moment, so he kept a longer distance, so as to avoid being noticed. But he still had drawn the attention of this man, who had tried several times to shake him off.It was not until Ye Xiao had drawn back another hundred yards, that the man finally relaxed.Ye Xiao had realized that this man\u2019s spiritual sense was superior to ordinary cultivators, so he didn\u2019t dare get any closer.The man finally reached the base of a mountain and quickly started to make his way to the peak. He kept on jumping, seemingly floating, to reach the top. Ye Xiao was just about to follow him before he sensed something and immediately backed off. Ye Xiao was scared half to death, and sweat started rolling down his back.It turned out the man had suddenly turned around to check for followers, when he had just steadily landed on the mountain.And then the man transformed into several ghost shadows which ran rapidly into different directions and then disappeared.\u201cThis guy could really make one\u2019s hackles rise with his unbelievable caution.\u201d Ye Xiao thought and quietly came down from a tree, and then he gingerly moved along the grass.He guessed that this place should be where the man\u2019s base was located.He was sure about it as he had seen the man acting with increased caution over here.Whoever had been backing this man should be beyond this mountain. Ye Xiao might not be able to confirm it, but he could at least get to know something if he went ahead and investigated.However, this place must be extremely dangerous!What troubled Ye Xiao most was that this mountain wasn\u2019t just any normal mountain. It was completely devoid of any vegetation!Whoever crossed the mountain top would definitely get exposed!Ye Xiao sneaked forward and only peaked his head above the mountaintop, and then he immediately drew back.There was a bamboo forest in front of him, a sea of bamboo trees.It wasn\u2019t surprising that a bamboo forest existed among the mountains. But, it was a totally different situation when it was inside the capital. Ye Xiao thought that this bamboo forest must be under the protection of the government. Therefore, it was either something which belonged to the government like the Royal Garden or something which belonged to someone\u2026 Who even the government wouldn\u2019t dare to mess with.Ye Xiao had just taken a glance and had seen nothing but the forest.Although he had just taken a single glance, he could confirm that there were no constructions within the forest.\u201cThis bamboo forest is truly weird somehow.\u201d Ye Xiao pondered.He couldn\u2019t believe that there actually was something in this mortal world that he couldn\u2019t figure out\u2026Ye Xiao quickly analyzed what he had seen with that glance, and suddenly two words emerged in his mind.\u2018Energy Arrays!\u2019As soon as he realised this, a feeling of danger invaded his senses.The very next moment, Ye Xiao ran away at top speed.Right after Ye Xiao left, about fifty men arrived from all over. They were obviously trying to quietly outflank Ye Xiao.Every one of them was equally strong as the man Ye Xiao had been tracing; in fact some of them might even be stronger.Anyway, each and every one of them was a lot stronger than the present Ye Xiao.If Ye Xiao had left a bit later and fallen into their trap, then he would\u2019ve definitely died; even if he had a thousand lives, it wouldn\u2019t be enough to survive!However, at least Ye Xiao had something in mind this time.All the framing, the assaults and the disturbances\u2026 were originating from this place.This mountain.This forest.\u2026Just before Ye Xiao had stumbled upon the bamboo forest, the man in white was sitting on his wheelchair that was being pushed by Wan-er. They were walking leisurely.Dozens of men in black ran across the forest and gathered around him one after another, but none of them dared to make a single sound. They just stood silently.\u201cDid Hei-Yi come back?\u201d The man in white spoke with half-closed eyes.\u201cNo. But he wouldn\u2019t get into any accidents with his strength in such a place.\u201d One of the men answered humbly.\u201cAnything in the world could go wrong. Nothing is absolute.\u201d The man in white took a deep breath and said, \u201cIt is always better to be cautious.\u201dThe words just came out of his mouth right before another man in black wearing a mask arrived quietly.The masked man was just about to speak, when the man in white suddenly opened his eyes looking to his left and said seriously, \u201cSomeone has tracked you here! Go get him!\u201dThe masked man in black felt ashamed and his face immediately turned red.The other men were all looking at him with an open-mouth.The masked man couldn\u2019t believe that he had just drawn an enemy home.In fact he wouldn\u2019t even have noticed the tracer if his master hadn\u2019t said it!He was extremely abashed.With the order from their master, the men in black flew out to intercept the invader.\u201cNobody\u2019s here. What\u2019s going on?\u201d When they arrived at the barren mountaintop, they were surprised.They thought their master could not have made such mistakes, so if he said there was a tracer, there must be a tracer.But where was he?A slender figure suddenly arrived at the mountaintop with a delightful scent. It was Wan-Er.She took a deep breath and then looked into the distance. The path she was looking at was exactly the direction toward which Ye Xiao had fled.The next moment, Wan-Er frowned and said softly, \u201cIt was an expert!\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, young lady?\u201d Hei-Yi was a bit relaxed and felt lucky when he saw that nobody was here, but he turned nervous again when he heard Wan-Er.\u201cThis man was hiding here and waiting for a chance to take action.\u201d Wan-Er looked down at the grass on the mountaintop. The grass was pale green and was obviously ill.Along the direction where Wan-Er was looking at, there were actually some bent blades of grass. It was not very obvious, but it couldn\u2019t be hidden from her sight.\u201cHere. There is grass over here, but only three blades are broken. It means that this guy is very good at movement skills and is very cautious. The three broken grass blades are the result of his panic. He panicked because he noticed our presence. This guy has a perfect hiding skill.The spot where I was standing is the best place to hide on the mountaintop. It is the only spot on the three mountains from which he could watch down on us and wouldn\u2019t be detected\u2026 That means he is an attentive and experienced man.A very short period of time had passed between the time Hei-Yi left this place and the time master noticed the tracer. Even if he had seen us, he could take no more than a glance.We came here very quickly, but found nobody.This guy must have a very good spiritual sense, so he noticed the danger and left after just a glance.He is decisive. He has no hesitations. He had a very scary resolution. Most people will definitely watch us for a longer time, because it is impossible to figure out our array using a single glance. However, this man just left decisively\u2026This man must be very resolute! If a poisonous snake bit his arm, he would cut his arm off decisively!Moreover, this guy has a particular smell. It was a pure smell of nature. He must have achieved the ablution of muscles and bones. Otherwise he won\u2019t carry such smell.The three broken grass blades are not in the same spot. One of his knees must have pressed on one of them; his hands must have pressed on the others. His other knee must be bent and he must\u2019ve been preparing to move. Otherwise there would be four broken grass blades instead.According to the three marks, he can\u2019t be very tall\u2026 but he is big, well, unless he had changed his appearance with disguise skills\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIf Ye Xiao was to hear the analyses made by this girl, he would be astonished.It was hard to believe that the girl actually had inferred so many details by only three marks of broken grasses.It was very difficult to develop such skill \u2013 extremely difficult.This girl, Wan-Er, was just a maid to the man in white!If a maid was already this strong, what would her master be like?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 33 \u2013 An Absolute AccidentWan-Er frowned and thought for a while.\u201cHowever, there may be a small mistake in what I just said. This guy may not be as strong as we imagine. If he was really that strong, he wouldn\u2019t have left marks on the grass. But if he really wasn\u2019t that strong, it\u2019s terrifying that our enemy has such decisiveness.\u201dThey all understood that a stronger cultivator had a stronger determination, as he had experienced more, and it was truly terrifying that a cultivator who wasn\u2019t strong actually had such a decisive attitude.Wan-Er spoke slowly with a soft voice as her clothes were fluttering in the wind, \u201cThis guy is not very strong, but may cause some unpredictable troubles in the future. If he is from the Ye clan, then the unpredictable troubles are coming to us for sure.\u201dAll the men in black lowered their heads with shame.Then they all left.There was only Wan-Er still standing there. She was lost in her thoughts.The man in white didn\u2019t show any response to what had happened. When Hei-Yi apologized, the man in white only replied, \u201cDoesn\u2019t such an enemy make the battle more interesting?\u201dAnd he continued, \u201cAbout the Ye Clan, do what you have to do. Next time, if you are traced again, bring the culprit to me.\u201dThere was actually a sense of longing in his eyes.A nervous excitement had invaded his heart, \u2018I have finally found someone to fight against and I hope he could be a formidable rival\u2019.What he was worried about was that he would be disappointed if Ye Xiao wasn\u2019t good enough.\u2026Ye Xiao ran off the mountain like a wild wind and then snuck back into the Ye Clan house. He found that his whole body was sweating!The sense of crisis had really given him a huge shock!He had never known that there was such a horrible place with such terrifying people so close to him!He hadn\u2019t calmed down in spite of reaching his home. He still felt scared. He felt that a poisonous snake had marked him.He remembered the bamboo forest and its vastness.He couldn\u2019t forget that he had clearly sensed a sharp gaze looking and aiming at him!The one who had noticed him was absolutely not a common expert cultivator.An expert cultivator like this shouldn\u2019t exist in the mortal world; instead, he should be in the Qing-Yun Realm!Ye Xiao was very sure about that, because he knew that a mortal world would never be able to contain such a person!However, it was the truth that this guy did exist here.Why?\u2026\u201cMy lord, we are framed. We are in huge trouble right now.\u201d Right after Ye Xiao stepped inside the house, the steward spoke to him. The steward seemed very dissatisfied and worried.\u201cTrouble?\u201d Ye Xiao frowned, \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\u201cErrh?\u201d The steward was surprised.He couldn\u2019t understand how killing eight expert cultivators of the Mu clan was not a huge trouble?\u201cEven if we weren\u2019t framed\u2026 the Mu clan would never make peace with us. This time, there is obviously someone wanting to stir up a disturbance. No matter what they are up to, for now, such actions are actually good for us.\u201dYe Xiao smiled.The steward felt relieved and said, \u201cYes.\u201d He increasingly felt that his young master was scheming something\u2026Ye Xiao stopped for a while and continued, \u201cHowever, there is also something bad for us. Things are fine for us at the moment, but the force that wants to stir the mess up must not be a friend of ours.It is a powerful enemy \u2013 an enemy that is impossible to deal with at the moment!\u201dWhen he was speaking, he thought of that mountain and that forest again.\u201cWell, sometimes enemies help us. As long as we keep being the secondary enemy of every force, we could actually remain safe if the cards are played right! We need to work with them and deal with their primary enemies together! That is an unchanged, useful strategy! In fact, we may not work with them, but instead, we could just use them!\u201dThe steward lowered his head without saying a word.Ye Xiao thought bitterly, \u201cIt turns out that to be regarded as a secondary enemy is also a self-perpetuating method.\u201d He felt kind of sad about it.The Xiao Monarch had never been looked down upon in his prior life. He had always been the primary target, no matter the enemy.However, now he needed to make use of his enemies\u2019 disdain to protect himself. It was a bitter pill to swallow.\u201cYou can despise me today, but sooner or later, I will be too high for you to reach!\u201d Ye Xiao took a deep breath and he thought, \u201cSomeday I will show you that it takes a huge amount of hard work to qualify to be my enemy!\u201dYe Xiao stepped into the house, \u201cI need to rest.\u201d\u201cThe Mu clan would never make peace with us\u2026\u201d The steward murmured and then was suddenly enlightened.Ye Xiao was about to enter his room, but he turned around and asked, \u201cUncle Song, I just got to know that there is a bamboo forest in the center of the capital. Do you know anything about it?\u201dThe steward was shocked.The bamboo forest didn\u2019t shock him; he was shocked because of the \u2018Uncle Song\u2019, which he hadn\u2019t been called for a long time.He was suddenly thrilled. His young master hadn\u2019t called him uncle Song since he was six years old!Now he was being called that again.Instantly, the old times were recalled in his mind! He felt like the kid who often cuddled him and sweetly called him uncle was now hugging him again.He felt like weeping.He then came back to himself and calmed down, and then smiled, \u201cThere is this place in the capital. It is a restricted zone. No one is allowed to enter it, not even the people from the noble clans or royal clans.\u201d\u201cRestricted zone? Is it really that important?\u201d Ye Xiao was surprised, \u201cI happened to see it when I was hanging around the other day. I didn\u2019t expect such a quiet place in the capital. I was thinking about buying a piece of land so that we could build a villa on it. I wonder who made this place. It actually is a restricted zone!\u201dSteward Song remained thrilled for quite a while. If only he knew what Ye Xiao was thinking right now.Who on earth could have the luck to be called uncle by the Xiao Monarch in this mortal world?It was just that Ye Xiao had realized how he should live in this second life.He was the Xiao Monarch but at the same time, he was also the foppish lord Ye Xiao. Since he was the foppish lord, he had to start over, to be the person who would eclipse what he once was.He needed to go through all trifles and emotions of a mortal, so as to achieve ultimate success!He had to experience everything in a mortal life, and most importantly, as Ye Xiao, the young lord.He should especially change his mindset; he had to let go of the past and embrace the present.The steward smiled and said, \u201cI am not sure about the details. But I heard that the owner of that area is an exceptional man\u2026\u201d\u201cAn exceptional man\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao thought for a while and nodded.He then turned around to go into his room, but the steward spoke, \u201cMy lord, are you still thinking about doing something with that bamboo forest? You must not do that. Even the king doesn\u2019t dare plan anything against that place\u2026\u201dYe Xiao was surprised, and then he replied, \u201cOk, I got it.\u201d\u2026It was in the Crown Prince\u2019s Palace.The envoy of the Mu Clan had settled here. Although there were about 45 of them, the Crown Prince\u2019s Palace didn\u2019t seem crowded at all.The eight, who had perished after attacking the General\u2019s House the other day, had been the vanguard of their forces.The crown prince hadn\u2019t shown his face since the start. In fact he had even gone to the Imperial Palace and hadn\u2019t come out even once.The crown princess and the Mu Clan knew clearly why the crown prince did so \u2013 he was unpleased because they had used their military force just to kill a brat, Ye Xiao!The crown prince was fighting against the other princes under the table and none of them were easy to deal with.He would be utterly isolated and would bite the dust if he wasn\u2019t careful enough. If he lost the throne, his life would be more miserable than a civilian\u2019s!At this crucial moment for him, the others, including his wife, had actually shown little consideration for his situation.Therefore, the crown prince was pissed; he was very angry. He had already told them his plan, but no one listened to him.However, the current situation wasn\u2019t just about him; it was about the whole clan. Hence, the crown prince could do nothing but hold his rage inside his mind.So he hid away from home.Since he had decided to hide, he surely needed to choose a secure location; the Imperial Palace was a really good place for him.In fact, it was his only choice and it was the perfect choice.To live with his father, the king, was not a comfortable thing to do for him and he might get into some trouble, but it allowed him to have some amount of control over everything!After all, it did more good than harm to his ambition!For the Mu clan, they didn\u2019t care whether the crown prince was or wasn\u2019t with them. It wouldn\u2019t make any difference to what they had planned, because they had everything they needed for this battle.The people from the Mu Clan were waiting for a long time for response from their vanguard. They kept waiting till the late hours.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWhy have they not yet returned?\u201d Said the leader \u2013 an old man. When he just finished asking, information about the eight men was finally sent back to them.A man in black, about 30 years old, entered the palace while scratching his head and he stuttered out a few words, \u201cB-Bad news\u2026\u201d He was quivering and his face was pale and filled with fear.\u201cWhat is it? What happened?\u201d Seeing the terrified look on this man\u2019s face, people instantly felt nervous.They stood up at the same time.\u201cThe eight vanguards\u2026 who went to the house of Ye\u2026 died in the General\u2019s House!

The eight dead bodies were sent to the guardian\u2019s department of the capital\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat! What did you say?\u201d The old man slapped the table hard and stood up at once, \u201cUnbelievable!\u201dThe others looked at each other in speechless despair.They felt shocked, as they couldn\u2019t imagine that there was actually such a powerful force in a general\u2019s family.They knew clearly what strength the eight vanguards had; in fact, that was why they were shocked when they were told that the eight powerful men all got killed by a single strike!The crown princess was sitting on her chair. She was shocked and her mouth was wide open when she heard the conversation.They all felt that it was unimaginable! As if a ghost suddenly appeared right in front of them!The crown princess even felt a bit dizzy at the moment.\u201cThe Ye clan!!\u201d The old man humphed heavily and his eyes were filled with coldness, \u201cTell me. How did it happen?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 At first they were in a quarrel. Then they started to rush into the house. At the same time, the steward of the house shouted \u2018stop them\u2019, and then many voices sounded from the house. Seven men of the Ye Clan showed up first and stopped our men beyond the ground. Each of them\u2026 took only one strike! And then\u2026\u201d\u201cOne strike\u2026\u201d Everyone gasped fearfully.\u201cThat\u2019s right. One strike\u2026\u201d\u201cTonight, I am going to experience myself the unfathomable power of the Ye clan!\u201d The old man\u2019s eyes were lit up with a sense of killing.\u201cWell\u2026 Tomorrow is the day when the auction of the supreme dan beads will be held\u2026\u201d A middle-aged scholar beside him spoke out, \u201cBesides, if the Ye clan was truly that powerful, we might be defeated unexpectedly\u2026 First thing\u2019s first. I think we should aim for the supreme dan beads\u2026 and take them back to our clan. We could avenge Cheng-Bai later, after the auction. If we hold up our clan\u2019s mission because of some revenge, then we spoil the ship for a halfpennyworth of tar\u2026 No one wants to take such blame.\u201dEveryone was silent.The next moment, a voice sounded outside the door, \u201cMessage from the king.\u201dIt continued with the king\u2019s words, \u201cThe capital is involved in a great disturbance. All of you should stay dutiful. Do not make any arbitrary moves\u2026\u201dAnd then messages from different forces came to the Prince\u2019s Palace one by one.\u201cThe prime chief of the Qing-Yun Sect has brought three disciples to the Chen-Xing City.\u201d\u201cThe second prime chief of the Cang-Shan sect has settled with their disciples in the Chen-Xing City, right beside the salesroom.\u201d\u201cThe prime dan-maker and the hierarch of Ling-Yun Sect has entered the Chen-Xing City with seven disciples.\u201d\u201cThe Wu-Liang Sect has entered the Chen-Xing City.\u201d\u201cThe Long clan has come to the capital!\u201d\u201cThe Nan-Gong clan has arrived in the capital\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Gong-Sun clan\u2026\u201d\u2026Messages were piling-up in front of them. Like it was said in the king\u2019s message, the capital was caught in a great disturbance!In fact, the disturbance was caused by the auction of those supreme dan beads.If they continued messing with the Ye clan and caused another delay of the auction, then, all the sects and clans would definitely see them as the first target to hit.And\u2026 the General\u2019s House was not far from the salesroom, so it would be impossible for them to get away from those crazy people.The old man\u2019s face turned dark and he took a deep breath, \u201cYou are right. The clan comes first.\u201dHe surely needed to say something obedient, but everyone knew about his reluctance to do so just by looking at his dark face.\u201cLet\u2019s go collect the bodies of our men first!\u201d The old man felt helpless when he said so.When Mu Cheng-Bai died, they had made some plans to avenge him; now there were eight more of them who had died, but he could do nothing but wait for an opportunity!It really was driving them crazy!\u2026On the other side, Ye Xiao felt relieved when he saw the sun rising up.It was finally the day of the auction!He was certain that he would not be attacked today.In fact, one day was all Ye Xiao needed to fill up the spiritual space and to feed the Heaven\u2019s Cyan.Besides, he needed to make a plan to ensure his family\u2019s safety.However, it would be better if he could get more time.Anyway, at least he could get a day if he could hang on till the auction.The steward felt relieved too. People who were sent to watch the Ye clan all felt relieved, as well as Su Ye-Yue, Lan Lang-Lang and Zuo Wu-Ji.After the battle that happened the other night, everyone had been well prepared. At least they all knew about what the Ye clan was capable of\u2026Even the crown prince and the king, who were in the Imperial Palace, felt relieved at this moment.Although what happened between the Mu clan and the Ye clan the other night was just a battle between two forces, it was something that had drawn everyone\u2019s attention\u2026In a single day, things totally changed in the capital. Different forces settled in the capital but the whole situation was oddly kept in balance! At least it looked peaceful and gave the illusion that nothing was happening.\u2026Early morning, before the sun rose, the Ling-Bao Hall was still sparsely occupied. However, everyone who passed the door could feel that a lot of eyes were inspecting the hall.When the first sunlight shone, the colorful flag of the Ling-Bao Hall was finally raised. It was a seven-colored flag which was waving in the air and it showed the people that the auction taking place over here would be extraordinary.People who saw the flag felt excited.The seven-colored flag meant that this was a top-class auction!There had only been three instances in the mortal world when the seven-colored flag had been raised, so everyone interested in this auction felt thrilled when they saw the flag.Since the salesroom had already raised the seven-colored flag, there were going to be immensely valuable items for auction!All the clans and sects would definitely want to participate in today\u2019s auction!They needed to take advantage of the auction to improve their strength, to break through the bottleneck of their cultivation, to train their successors\u2026There was a long way to go for all of them!\u2026The sun was shining on the roof of the salesroom and the flag was gently waving in the air. A lot of instruments were creating music, which seemed to cover the entire auction hall. The door of the salesroom was suddenly opened and then two columns of girls in white came out. Their long dresses were fluttering as they walked. They stood still on each side of the door and a red carpet spread between the two columns from inside the salesroom to the street.The wind was flowing. The white dresses were fluttering, their beautiful hair was waving in the air and an enchanting scent was spreading all over!\u201cIt is the top standard!\u201dSome people couldn\u2019t help staring at the girls while everyone realized the same problem \u2013 they didn\u2019t know if they had brought enough money or not.They didn\u2019t want to be disgraced.\u201cThe auction begins shortly inside the Ling-Bao Hall salesroom! All our honored guests please get in the salesroom!\u201d A loud voice was sounding like a huge bell.Some people started to enter the Ling-Bao Hall from different ways in front of the door.They were all wearing robes and walked leisurely. They acted like sages.Some other people had actually arrived for a long time, but they didn\u2019t get into the salesroom with the crowd.There was a latent rule for entering the salesroom at the auction that people should take turns to enter the salesroom \u2013 the stronger person entered first. He who broke the rule might get killed\u2026 If one was to mess with some powerful guy, his entire clan might get wiped out.People in the martial world cared a lot about prestige.A man would enter when it was his turn; if someone entered before him and he thought this \u2018someone\u2019 was inferior\u2026 then he would start a fight against the inferior fellow who had the audacity to enter before him!And it was basically, a fight of life and death.In front of the door, there was an emcee naming the list, in a singing voice.\u201cThe prime master of the Qing-Yun Sect, Meng Wu-Fei. Mr. Meng, please!\u201d\u201cThe master of the Cang-Shan Sect, Li Chang-Qing. Mr. Li, Please!\u201d\u201cThe hierarch of the Ling-Yun Sect, Xiao Mo-Yan, Please!\u201d\u2026The names of the important persons in the martial world were read aloud one by one. People felt awed when they heard these names.All of them were legendary people in this mortal world, and now they were all here.They were all here for a simple auction!As more and more big shots were called, about twenty of them had already entered. And there were still a lot of people crowded outside the door.Everyone started to get excited. They wondered how many more great men would actually turn up.There was more than one supreme dan bead for sure, but there were absolutely not enough dan beads for all of them!A sign of a foreseeable battle was showing up silently!Well in fact, it was a battle of financial might!No matter who won, he was definitely going to pay through the nose this time.Suddenly, a man with a strong body and a square face casually stepped to the door jumping the queue. He looked somewhat handsome.People were surprised. They couldn\u2019t believe that there was actually someone who dared to break the custom!They thought that even though no one in the queue would stop him, people from the Ling-Bao Hall would definitely banish him at once!Surprisingly, people from the Ling-Bao Hall didn\u2019t do anything, except that the emcee spoke loudly, \u201cFeng Zhi-Ling, Master Feng, Please!\u201d\u201cMaster Feng? Who the hell is Master Feng?\u201dThe crowd was in an uproar.They had never heard of this name before.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBut this guy came and casually entered the salesroom\u2026Why? Was this unknown guy really that important?Who was he?Where was he from? What was his background? How could he enter before all the great men who were still standing outside?There were too many questions lying inside everybody\u2019s mind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He casually walked into the salesroom and stood against the handrail on the second floor, looking down at the crowd.He was acting high profile in everyone\u2019s eyes.All the people were giving him confused looks, but he remained indifferent and ignored them all.He just stood there silently and carefully observed everyone who entered the salesroom.The prime connoisseur of the salesroom, Guan Wan-Shan, walked over humbly and smiled, \u201cBrother Feng. You are early. I apologize for not being at the entrance to personally greet you.\u201dIn fact, Guan Wan-Shan was thinking, \u201cDidn\u2019t he say he wanted to stay low key? Why is he acting so strikingly in front of such a large crowd? Does he not know that he may expose himself?\u201dYe Xiao spoke calmly, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I just want to check and see whether my dan beads will be sold for a proper price.\u201dGuan Wan-Shan replied seriously, \u201cNo need to worry about that. Such a legendary treasure is certainly something people are willing to die for. In fact, we bought 5 beads from you for only 500 thousand silver bars. We truly have taken advantage of you.\u201dYe Xiao said peacefully, \u201cWell, I am sure that if you didn\u2019t get this little advantage, you wouldn\u2019t have been able to handle this job properly.\u201dAlthough he was experienced in reception, Guan Wan-Shan couldn\u2019t give a reply. He thought, \u201cThis guy is too straight; he talks nothing like a business man. He knows nothing about confabulation and doesn\u2019t care about my feelings at all.\u201dSo he walked away after making a few more conventional remarks.People from different sects were seated on the first floor and people from the royal families and the noble clans were taking their seats.The eight noble clans were well known worldwide and all of them held unimaginable power. Although their positions were still lower than the royal families, everyone knew that this arrangement was only in name.After all, it was the royal blood that ruled the land, not the noble clans.Meanwhile, the names from the Mu clan sounded at the door. An old man and a middle-aged man entered. Both of them were wearing robes with serious and righteous looks. They casually entered the salesroom.They acted nobly, like dragons and tigers, and showed an overbearing attitude!They were showing exactly what a noble clan should be like!Ye Xiao\u2019s eyes were distant when he saw them. He tightly clenched his right fist, which was hidden underneath his sleeve.The power of the gelid qi was aroused and was swarming in his fist.It was traceless and silent.\u201cOf course they are one of the noble clans. Look at their distinguished manners.\u201d\u201cAbsolutely. That\u2019s the spirit of a noble clan\u2026\u201dPeople couldn\u2019t stop praising these two men.The two men from the Mu clan didn\u2019t seem pleased at all; but in fact, they were delighted inside their minds. They were sure that after the auction, they would be promoted as they had rendered a great service to their clan\u2026They felt that they had already shown everyone the great image of their clan\u2026Meanwhile\u2026When the middle-aged Mu clan delegate was striding proudly ahead\u2026He suddenly felt his foot slip. He had been really complacent and vigorous, but he unexpectedly lost his balance and staggered ahead, nearly falling on the floor. But, he was an experienced cultivator and was able to use the spiritual energy in his body to forcefully steady himself. Otherwise, he would definitely have suffered an embarrassing tumble.Even so, it still looked quite awkward. Such an accident suddenly came out from nowhere. He thought that it was ridiculous!People\u2019s praises immediately turned into silence. Everyone was stunned. They couldn\u2019t believe that a delegate of the well-known Mu clan was actually acting in such a clumsy manner during this important occasion.After a while, some people in the crowd started to laugh aloud.The next moment, the middle-aged man stood straight, completely flustered. He looked down at his feet and saw nothing wrong. He continued walking ahead as he thought that it would be more embarrassing if he stopped now. So he braced himself up and took a step ahead cautiously. He acted like nothing had happened.When he took the third step he finally felt relieved. However, the next moment he suddenly felt that his foot had slipped again!Again, it was totally unexpected. It was even more embarrassing this time. \u2013 Poof \u2013 He staggered ahead with great momentum!He almost rushed forward!As he moved too fast, his hands uncontrollably rose up and he immediately fell down to the floor. He really couldn\u2019t hold himself up, so he had to quickly draw back and put his hands on the floor. He finally prevented his head from crashing on the ground disgracefully.He then used his flying skills to raise his body and stood straight. His face was totally flushed, like it was about to bleed.He had just brought shame on himself and his clan in everyone\u2019s eyes!\u201cWhy is he acting like this\u2026 What the fxxk is wrong with him? He\u2019s from one of the bloody noble clans\u2026 It may be just an accident to fall down the first time, but to fall down again is even worse, isn\u2019t it just too stupid?\u201d\u201cHey you! He is from the Mu clan alright?! Don\u2019t involve the others! Can you talk decently?\u201d\u201cUrhh\u2026 Yes, you\u2019re right\u2026 Haha ha\u2026\u201dThe crowd burst into a peal of laughter and it lasted a long time!The old man \u2013 the other delegate of the Mu clan rebuked the middle-aged man in a low voice with embarrassment written all over his face, \u201cWhat is wrong with you? How could you make such a stupid mistake at this important moment? You are really an unbecoming useless shit! You shouldn\u2019t have come with me!\u201dThe middle-aged man was so embarrassed that he had to bow and explain, \u201cIt felt like I stepped on some ice\u2026\u201dThe old man raged, \u201cBull-fxxking-shit! Ice in a hot summer?! It is in the Ling-Bao Hall! How could there possibly be ice on the floor? You could at least make up a better excuse! Moron! I should let your mother have an abortion if I knew you would bring me such shame!\u201dThe middle-aged man had no words to argue against the old man so he just kept apologising, but he was thinking, \u201cMy mother was dead long ago\u2026 You beat her to death\u2026 How dare you mention her\u2026 Old bastard, I would kick you to death if you were not my bloody father!\u201dThey both had suspected that someone was messing with them, but they quickly gave up on this idea, as they thought nobody would dare to do such a thing in front of all these people. Besides, they didn\u2019t feel any trace of spiritual power, so they had no reason to make that presumption. As the old man had said, it was in the Ling-Bao Hall; even the eight noble clans, who were usually pretentious, didn\u2019t dare declare themselves to be the most powerful.The most important thing was that even though these two fellows had seen many things in the world, they could never have thought of a wonderful martial art called the East-rising Purple Qi!On the second floor, Ye Xiao relaxed after assaulting the Mu clan delegates. He quickly loosened his fist when he felt a hint of coldness on his palm.Minutes ago, he had used his gelid qi to make two pieces of ice that were thinner than cicada\u2019s wings. He had been remotely controlling the ice and had set the ice under the poor middle-aged delegate\u2019s feet. No one had noticed it!In fact, it was a risky move.But in the end, Ye Xiao had successfully played a trick on the Mu clan and most importantly, it had gone unnoticed!People in this place might not be that powerful in the Xiao Monarch\u2019s eyes, but right now, he was just Ye Xiao. These men here were all the top-class cultivators of this world. Ye Xiao might have the chance to overwhelm one or two of them, but it wouldn\u2019t be easy!There were some people from the sects that Ye Xiao was unable to see through. So he kept his mind completely alert.The assault was just an inoffensive trick, but what it had resulted in was enough to satisfy Ye Xiao for now.\u201cThe East-rising Purple Qi is truly wonderful. It must be the number 1 martial art in the world!\u201d Ye Xiao was thinking, \u201cIf anything in the future with which I can not deal personally happened, I can totally use such skill to overcome it. No trace will be left! It is really a perfect skill for assassination and sneak raid\u2026\u201dYe Xiao kept looking at the red carpet on the first floor and found nothing. Only after this, did he show his satisfaction.The ice vanished quietly after it had made the man\u2019s feet slip. It left no marks of water or any other color. It was truly traceless and soundless.Ye Xiao believed that even if it were on dry soil, the ice would leave no trace, especially in the battle field where everyone was fighting and sweating\u2026A smile appeared on Ye Xiao\u2019s face.The next moment, Ye Xiao saw Su Ye-Yue and some of her sisters enter the salesroom. Following her were two lads who were dressed decently and walked into the house side by side. They seemed personable from a distance, but they were actually Lan Lang-Lang and Zuo Wu-Ji.One of them was walking like he had no spine and the other was looking around with his weirdly crossed eyes\u2026 They were somehow uncomely.They were muttering to each other.\u201cWhere is the little fxxker Ye Xiao? Doesn\u2019t he know that today is a big day for the \u2018three lords\u2019? We should atleast show up together\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI wonder if I can get my jade ruyi\u2026 Damn it, is it really happening? These people are not all coming for my jade ruyi, are they\u2026\u201d\u201cFxxk them all!\u201d\u201cWhat?

    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 36 \u2013 The Girl And The Golden HandThere were four groups of people who had come representing the royal families, about fifteen groups from the martial clans, and eight groups from the eight noble clans who were seated in the salesroom. There were also many people from the active sects while surprisingly, fifteen reclusive sects had actually sent their men here\u2026There were nearly four hundred people attending this auction, including those that were mentioned previously, and some unattached cultivators.Everyone who had arrived here had high status in the mortal world\u2026Such an auction was the only thing that could gather all these men in the recent ten years!It was time to close the door and begin the auction. No more people would be allowed into the salesroom.Suddenly, just as the doors were closing, a carriage slowly pulled over.The carriage had a strange appearance. It was made completely out of bamboos and it was small and exquisite. It looked upmarket and it was filled with the vivid scent of nature.The carriage stopped in front of the door.Two strong men bowed and opened the drapes. A beautiful foot reached out from the carriage slowly and stepped on the ground. It was an extreme eye catching scene.At the moment, this beautiful foot drew everyone\u2019s eyes immediately.The next moment, a girl in white with a gorgeous body and dark hair got off the carriage and stood at the entrance.She became the center of attention by simply standing there. Even though she was just wearing ordinary white clothes, its beauty surpassed thousands of glittering suits.By now, the salesroom had turned completely silent.People were all shocked by her elegance!\u201cSo this is the well-known Ling-Bao Hall, right?\u201d The girl in white entered through the doorway and smiled gently.The two lines of ceremonial girls at the door were actually charming, but they became commonplace girls when compared to the smiling beauty in white.Guan Wan-Shan hurried out and looked terrified. He was no longer his usual calm self. He stopped in front of the girl in white and gave a humble salute, \u201cIt is my honor to meet you here, my lady. How is the master?\u201dThe girl in white looked at him and smiled. She slightly returned a salute and said, \u201cOh I am surprised that Master Guan still remembers me. Thanks for your concern. My master is fine.\u201dGuan Wan-Shan felt relaxed and kept bowing, \u201cYou have graced Ling-Bao Hall with your presence, my lady! Please! Come on in, my lady.\u201dThe girl in white smiled, \u201cI came without notifying you. I hope you don\u2019t mind, Master Guan\u2026\u201dGuan Wan-Shan had started sweating and kept bowing, \u201cNo. No. No\u2026 Your presence is our enormous honor\u2026\u201dThe girl in white, along with the humbled Guan Wan-Shan, entered the salesroom with a smile.Following her were two men in black, completely expressionless, like two majestic pillars\u2013 one at her left while the other at her right.Ye Xiao looked at the girl and her guards. He felt extremely curious.Who was this girl?Guan Wan-Shan was simply the connoisseur of the Ling-Bao Hall, not a supreme cultivator, but everyone knew that there was an extremely powerful force backing the Ling-Bao Hall. That was why even the eight noble clans dared not to make any trouble in the salesroom. Yet Guan Wan-Shan acted so humbly in front of the girl in white and was actually terrified of offending her! Why?In addition, they mentioned a person when they were talking \u2013 the master!Who was the master?Ye Xiao\u2019s face was peaceful, but he was thinking nervously, \u201cGuan Wan-Shan called that guy \u2018master\u2019. That is nothing strange. But the noble girl also called that guy \u2018master\u2019. Now that is strange\u2026 Could it be\u2026\u201dYe Xiao gasped and thought about one possibility, \u201c\u2026 Could it be that this noble girl who seems powerful is only a maid of that \u2018master\u2019?\u201dAs Ye Xiao speculated, this girl was just a maid, but Guan Wan-Shan treated her respectfully \u2013 in fact, he was extremely humble. There must be a mystery behind their relationship!The question was that who on earth could actually have such gorgeous beauty as his maid?The girl was walking. She suddenly looked up at Ye Xiao with her charming eyes, and smiled, \u201cMaster Guan, the auction is still far from beginning and there is already a friend standing beside the handrail in the upper floor\u2026 I guess this friend is not an ordinary man.\u201dGuan Wan-Shan was an experienced man, so he understood that the girl was actually enquiring about Ye Xiao. It looked like the smart girl had already noticed that Ye Xiao was not an ordinary person.People of the salesroom were all busy preparing for the auction, so she was sure Ye Xiao wasn\u2019t a staff member. Everyone else was sitting and waiting for the auction to begin and wouldn\u2019t leisurely stand there.So when the girl noticed that Ye Xiao was different, she naturally felt curious about his identity.Ye Xiao stood there away from the crowd, because firstly, he wanted to watch the outstanding cultivators among the crowd, so that he could be prepared for any possible situations; secondly, he was in disguise so he didn\u2019t need to be cautious about getting into any trouble; thirdly, as a profound man, he was actually trying to attract the attention of elegant young ladies\u2026The girl in white had given her attention to Ye Xiao, and it was just what he had wished for. The girl was interested in Ye Xiao while Ye Xiao was interested in her as well. The girl had completely drawn his attention when she showed up. Ye Xiao felt her uniqueness which made him interested in both her and her master.The girl and Ye Xiao held \u2018affections\u2019 towards each other and they looked like a couple on their first date, but nobody knew that Guan Wan-Shan was in an awkward situation.The girl was asking him about Ye Xiao and he should have answered her without hesitation. However, Ye Xiao was the man who had provided the supreme dan beads, and he didn\u2019t want her to know this fact.If her master learnt this fact, the Ling-Bao Hall would lose the chance to get more supreme dan beads from Feng Zhi-Ling.So he had to lie to the girl even though he knew he might offend the powerful master!Guan Wan-Shan spoke bitterly, \u201cI beg your forgiveness my lady. The guy is an old friend of mine. He has been in the wild for a long time so\u2026 he barely knows etiquettes. Please forgive him.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d The girl answered peacefully, \u201cIt is a man without etiquettes! A man like this may bring you huge trouble someday\u2026\u201dShe had a soft voice, but this sentence sounded scary.She looked around for a bit before finally rested her gaze on Ye Xiao once again.She decided to figure out who this guy was.Ye Xiao sensed the sharpness of the girl\u2019s gaze.\u201cWell? The girl is trying to mess with me! Does she want to check my background?\u201d He thought.Then Ye Xiao spoke gently, \u201cYou are so imposing, my lady. I am afraid you have no rights to poke your nose into other\u2019s business, as you are just a little girl. A lady speaking like that, I am afraid it has showed your ignorance. In my opinion, your master should teach you more about manners.\u201dGuan Wan-Shan called her \u2018my lady\u2019 was because of his respect, but when Ye Xiao used it, it sounded sarcastic.The girl in white frowned, \u201cSir, I am afraid you are overreacting. What? Is your name really that unpresentable?\u201dYe Xiao glanced at her and replied, \u201cYou spoke bitingly first. I just stroke back. How am I overreacting? I don\u2019t know if my name is unpresentable, but I am not. I am standing right here.\u201dGuan Wan-Shan was awfully anxious. The girl and Feng Zhi-Ling were having a standoff right in his face; they might start a fight if this continues. He felt bitter in his heart, as the situation right now was completely out of his control.He didn\u2019t understand how this Feng Zhi-Ling, who used to be so steady, could become so unreasonable at this moment. He actually got himself into a quarrel right as the auction was about to begin, and that too against somebody he should never mess with.And he also didn\u2019t understand how the smart and elegant lady could become so hot-headed.However, what he truly didn\u2019t know was that they were doing exactly what they intended to do.Even though the girl and Ye Xiao didn\u2019t know each other, they felt the importance of each other. Ye Xiao felt that the girl was someone important while the girl felt the same about Ye Xiao, so coincidentally, they produced this conflict together. It created the seed for future interaction between them.They were both smart and insightful.The girl in white spoke chillingly, \u201cYou talk wildly, so you must have some outstanding abilities, I assume.\u201d She was challenging him.Ye Xiao sneered, \u201cOf course I have some specialties. It is a dangerous world after all. Do you dare to try me?\u201d He faced the challenge head on!The girl\u2019s face turned gloomy and she spoke calmly, \u201cGo get him!\u201dOne of the men in black behind her suddenly jumped up high with a focused look in his eyes. He turned into a black whirlwind in the air making a cracking noise, and then he suddenly reached his hand out to whack Ye Xiao\u2019s scalp.It was a slapping move. If Ye Xiao was incautious, he would be killed instantly!Ye Xiao glared down at the moving figure and shouted, \u201cNice move.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWhen the man was about to reach the upper floor and get Ye Xiao, Ye Xiao had already rushed out from the handrail like a flying arrow. He was rushing toward the man in black, aiming for a direct confrontation!\u2013 Puff! \u2013 His hand suddenly emerged from the sleeve and instantly turned golden!It was one of Ye Xiao\u2019s special martial skills. It allowed him to turn his hand solid, like gold; it was a hand that could crush mountains into pieces! It could crush everything!It was the Golden Hand!\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 37 \u2013 The Fight And The PromiseThe man in black was aiming to jump higher than Ye Xiao so that he could occupy a commanding position in order to attack Ye Xiao with a fierce strike. However, Ye Xiao had noticed his intention and struck out earlier than the man had expected. Now it was Ye Xiao who occupied the higher position!There was no turning-around for both of them. Both of their hands collided in an instant. \u2013 Bang! \u2013 Golden lights flashed out and dazed the surrounding people, all of them suddenly lost their vision because of these flashing lights.The man in black felt confused and withdrew his hand. He stopped his offence and immediately decided to focus on his defense. He tried everything he could to defend himself in order to stay unharmed. He wasn\u2019t rising up anymore; instead, he was falling to the ground. Ye Xiao was still above him and his golden hand was reaching for his scalp, while constantly emitting a golden glow. Ye Xiao was being extremely aggressive in order to beat the enemy as soon as possible.The girl in white had watched every move made by Ye Xiao. She looked worried instead of calm, and she said, \u201cHei-San will suffer\u2026 He shouldn\u2019t have jumped like that. The way he fights is only suitable for the situation where he has the higher position. Now he is fighting from a lower position. He may have won if the enemy had been much weaker than him, but he has made a rash move as he didn\u2019t know his enemy completely. How could an experienced cultivator like him make such an uncharacteristic mistake?\u201dThe other man in black, who was still standing behind the girl answered with a straight face, \u201cYes, he did make a mistake. But if it was me, I would take the same approach. We want to beat that guy in a challenging way so as to bring honor to you. The guy looked like he was only at the Grade of Renyuan and should have been very weak compared to Hei-San and me, so we were confident that we could beat him anyway. However, we didn\u2019t know that the guy was hiding his energy. In fact, he has at least reached the intermediate level of the Grade of Diyuan! It must be a snare he uses to fool people like us. I don\u2019t think we can win this fight.\u201dThe girl in white hadn\u2019t expected the man in black to talk this much, as he was usually quiet.During the time they were talking\u2026Ye Xiao landed on the ground with a laugh. He then proceeded to use both of his two golden hands at the same time which moved rapidly and created two lines of golden flashes. This made his hands look like it was lightning.\u2013 Swish! Swish! Swish! \u2013He was making unpredictable moves; he completely sacrificed his defense and focused only on his offence.The man in black, who was at a disadvantage, was ashamed and angry. He strained all of his muscles to keep his defense up and wait for an opportunity to counter-attack, but he got no such opportunity under the relentless barrage of strikes given by Ye Xiao.The man in black, Hei-San, hadn\u2019t thought that his enemy could hit so aggressively. He hadn\u2019t expected that he would fall into such an awkward situation where he could only suffer and not be able to retaliate. All he had done was just make a mistake in gauging the opponent\u2019s strength at the beginning!He didn\u2019t understand why Ye Xiao could pressure him to such an extent, as he knew that he was much stronger than Ye Xiao! He wasn\u2019t even getting time to breathe!Hei-San was finally forced down to the ground after he jumped up and fought against Ye Xiao. Although, only a very short amount of time had passed since Hei-San had jumped to attack Ye Xiao, he had already taken nearly 40 solid slaps from Ye Xiao!\u2013 Bang! \u2013Hei-San stood on the ground with his feet planted firmly, like two metal pillars. The floor suddenly cracked and splinters flew in the air!He finally stood on the ground after taking some severe hits. He stood straight up after only staggering a bit! His eyes turned red. He felt humiliated and was preparing to start a furious attack of his own.On the other side, Ye Xiao took a beautiful somersault in the air during which, he clapped his golden hands once, causing them to revert back to their previous state. By the time he had stepped on the ground, his hands had completely turned normal. It was a beautiful movement. He then spoke peacefully with his hands on his back, \u201cYou are washed-up!\u201dHei-San stared at him and replied with a beast-like voice, \u201cAm I?\u201d\u201cYes you are.\u201d The girl in white agreed, \u201cAlthough you are at the higher level than him in cultivation, you touched the ground first\u2026 So, you lost.\u201dHei-San showed angry blush, \u201cBut\u2026 I\u2026 No one says that the one that touches the ground loses!\u201dThe girl stopped speaking and remained silent.Her silence was eerie and actually made the men in black feel stressed and terrified.Hei-San\u2019s face suddenly turned pale and he stepped forward in terror, \u201cI am so sorry my lady. I was wrong.\u201dThe girl glanced at him and said nothing.Hei-San was sweating a lot and finally kneeled at the girl\u2019s feet after some thinking. He laid his forehead on the ground and spoke in a low voice, \u201cMy lady. I was wrong! I beg your forgiveness!\u201dThe girl looked at him and sighed, \u201cWhen you lost, you lost; it is no big deal. If you kept such attitude all the time, you can only be a boor. The world of the martial arts would never accept you! Think about it\u2026 If it was not me whom you were talking to; instead, if it was\u2026 Do you think you would still be alive after talking like that?\u201dHei-San was shivering; he was too terrified.\u201cGet up.\u201d The girl in white spoke with a charming voice.Hei-San stood up to and returned to the left side of the girl, keeping his head lowered. He dared not to say anything now. The other man in black looked at him with a look which said \u2018thank god, you are so lucky\u2019.The men in black felt relieved.The girl looked at Ye Xiao and spoke cheerfully, \u201cWell fought. May I have your name please?\u201dYe Xiao kept his hands on his back and stood naturally, like an expert cultivator. He answered casually, \u201cFeng.\u201d\u201cMaster Feng.\u201d The girl immediately turned distant, \u201cYou are a good cultivator with spectacular skills. However, you insulted my man. That is quite an offence\u2026 Now as the auction is about to begin, it\u2019s better that we don\u2019t spend too much time talking. What do you say that you accompany me after the auction, if you have guts?\u201dYe Xiao laughed, \u201cA challenge? Do you think I, as a man, would fear you, a girl? Ok. See you after the auction.\u201d\u201c A promise is a promise.\u201d The girl added.\u201cA promise is a promise!\u201d Ye Xiao nodded seriously.What happened before was nothing important; what mattered the most was the agreement which they had made at the end.The girl nodded lightly and looked at Ye Xiao. And then she left with the two men in black.\u201cWait.\u201d Ye Xiao smiled and threw over a small bottle. The bottle dropped into Hei-San\u2019s arms.\u201cMy golden hands were poisonous.\u201d Ye Xiao spoke calmly.Hei-San was shocked and looked at Ye Xiao.The girl frowned and said to Hei-San, \u201cTake it.\u201d And then she smiled to Ye Xiao, \u201cThanks Master Feng.\u201dYe Xiao smiled, \u201cNo problems. It wouldn\u2019t be good for anybody if someone died.\u201dThen they both laughed.The girl in white went on walking away with the two men in black.They became more cautious and confused, \u201cGolden Hand? Poisonous? Got poisoned imperceptibly? What is that skill?\u201dThey felt that this Master Feng deserved their respect.They didn\u2019t know that the \u2018Golden Hand\u2019 was like Feng Zhi-Ling\u2019s face \u2013 a disguise.When the two men in black walked past him, Ye Xiao felt uneasiness in his mind.The men in black had brought Ye Xiao a sense of familiarity.He seemed to know them.Moreover, when he was fighting against one of them, Ye Xiao had a felt something peculiar- a feeling of bloodlust, originating from a blademaster.He knew that only expert bladesmasters could produce such a feeling.Ye Xiao had noticed that the man had many calluses on the edge of his palm.The calluses were special.\u201cThey were not the calluses that were caused by casually playing with swords. He was a blademaster.\u201d He thought, \u201cBlades. Blademasters. It feels familiar\u2026\u201dYe Xiao suddenly recollected the figures that had flown away from his house the other night. He looked at the direction where the girl had gone, but they had vanished into thin air.\u201cIt was you.\u201d\u2026Ye Xiao had successfully gained vital information from the contact with the girl\u2019s bodyguard. He turned around and entered the salesroom. When he had just stepped inside the salesroom and the door was about to close, two new groups of people arrived at the scene.These two groups did not utter a single word and casually walked into the salesroom.\u2026\u2013 Dong! \u2013The bell rang. The salesroom turned silent.Guan Wan-Shan stood on the stage wearing a red robe. He was presiding the auction all by himself this time. His old face was filled with pride and delight.He was quite confident that, with this auction, a new record would be created.The thirty balconies were fully occupied, so was the main court in the first floor.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGuan Wan-Shan was completely pleased. He looked at the big crowd in front of him and felt a sense of achievement. Usually\u2026 it was difficult to invite just one or two of these people to attend an auction, but now they were all here!\u201cI declare the auction to have begun!\u201d Guan Wan-Shan knew well that these words were what the people wanted to hear the most, so he went straight to it.He didn\u2019t need to say anything to build the atmosphere. It might displease people if he spoke superfluous words, as right now, was definitely a special auction.\u2014\u2013[1] Hei-San: This name literally translates to Dark-Three.

The starting price has been set at 400 gold bars and the bid increment is 50 gold bars.\u201dIn fact, Guan Wan-Shan sounded downhearted.A Jade Ruyi was surely not an important item in such a top-class auction. Guan Wan-Shan originally didn\u2019t want it at the auction, but Feng Zhi-Ling had asked him to do so. And Guan Wan-Shan certainly didn\u2019t understand why\u2026When the Jade Ruyi showed up, the crowd was quiet, as expected.Everyone was either closing their eyes or looking away; nobody even thought about bidding. They didn\u2019t even want to bother showing their disdain!For these people, a Jade Ruyi really had no value.They were all revered experts; how could they be interested in such a mundane thing?Guan Wan-Shan felt helpless.He thought that Feng Zhi-Ling truly had undermined him this time\u2026 Feng Zhi-Ling had asked him to put the Jade Ruyi in the auction, but now it was going to be abortive as the first item\u2026Luckily a voice sounded, \u201cFour hundred Gold bars!\u201dIt was Zuo Wu-Ji!Guan Wan-Shan felt relieved. To him, Zuo Wu-Ji\u2019s voice was like a song from the heaven!Zuo Wu-Ji gave the first bid and then looked around nervously, but he found that no one was bidding after him. He was delighted.He didn\u2019t know that all the other people were saving their money for the supreme dan beads. They certainly wouldn\u2019t spend a penny on this Jade Ruyi. After all, they might need the 400 gold bars to win the dan beads; how could they take that risk?Guan Wan-Shan called the bid three times, but nobody even looked at him. He banged the gavel quickly and sold the first item to Zuo Wu-Ji at the starting price!Although it was a low-price deal, Guan Wan-Shan was happy about it. In fact, he felt a little bit thankful for Zuo Wu-Ji. In his mind, Zuo Wu-Ji had saved him in this awkward situation!Zuo Wu-Ji finally got the Jade Ruyi he so desperately wanted. He felt like he was dreaming, \u201cThat was so easy\u2026 I just got it? Nobody even tried to bid against me\u2026\u201dLan Lang-Lang\u2019s eyes popped wide open, \u201cWhat? That was too easy, wasn\u2019t it? What is going on?\u201dZuo Wu-Yi was holding the Jade Ruyi, yet he didn\u2019t feel happy.Instead, he was feeling a hint of depression.He used to think that his family was great, and that he was better than most of the people in this world. However, right at this moment, he found out that he was certainly not. The thing that he wanted so much turned out to be something that real cultivators disdained!Zuo Wu-Ji kept his head low while holding the Jade Ruyi in his arms.A feeling of humiliation appeared in his heart. \u201cThe Jade Ruyi is just garbage for them\u2026 Why should I want it so badly? Is it all about cultivation in this world?\u201dLan Lang-Lang was thinking, \u201cI thought millions of gold bars could be enough to make me a dragon among men. It turns out I was wrong\u2026 Having millions of gold bars means nothing\u2026 Even if I have an endless flow of money, how could I protect my wealth if I am not strong like these masters here?\u201d\u2026Ye Xiao was looking at his two best friends from the balcony and he couldn\u2019t help sighing.\u201cFinally you two have realized the truth; or maybe you have started to realize the truth.\u201d Ye Xiao sighed, \u201cWhat a shame\u2026 It is already too late. You have passed your perfect periods and it\u2019s pointless for you to start cultivating now. How can either of you ever reach the pinnacle of cultivation in your lives?\u201dWhile collecting his thoughts, he heard Guan Wan-Shan\u2019s voice, \u201cThe next item is a Crystal Lotus. This Crystal Lotus is 1500 years old. Its petals have shown some red streaks. It is about to become a Bloodshot Lotus. It is an extraordinary medical material. The starting price is 5000 silver bars; 500 silver bars is added for each bid.\u201dYe Xiao\u2019s eyes lit up.The Crystal Lotus?The old man of the Mu Clan raised his hand, \u201c5500.\u201dThe Crystal Lotus was the perfect foundation for young children to take the initial step in cultivation. When a baby was born, the pure qi that was given to him inside his mother\u2019s body would start to diminish. A Crystal Lotus could maintain the natural born pure qi inside the baby and incorporate it with the qi obtained once he started cultivating after growing older. It would help a person to become an expert cultivator in the shortest time. The child who had taken the Crystal Lotus could improve three times faster than others.However, the child needed to be a natural born cultivator, and it needed a cultivator of the Grade of Tianyuan to guide him.In fact, there were not many people who placed bids after the Mu Clan did. In fact, only the eight noble clans were bidding for the Crystal Lotus.The national order of this mortal world had always confused Ye Xiao. He couldn\u2019t comprehend how the three different kind of forces were coexisting.Bit by bit, he finally figured out the relationship of the three major figures of the mortal world \u2013 the noble clans, the martial sects and the royal families.\u201cI thought the martial sects did not have a high position in the world, but I was wrong. In fact, they have a remarkable position. They actually look down upon all the ordinary items. They are not keen for political powers; they like to control things under the table and then seize the resources for their ultimate goals\u2026 So they have political influence, but only just enough to acquire their goals. They weren\u2019t interested in political powers, they were interested in the power that came from cultivation\u2026\u201d\u201cThe noble clans are trying their best to get what the martial sects disregard. The noble clans are much weaker than the martial sects in cultivation. However, the noble clans are active in the mortal society, so they have bigger influence in the society than the martial sects\u2026 Even though the martial sects think little of influence, it is still something important in the mortal world\u2026 In fact, there are many people from the noble clans that have joined the sects, or work for the royal families\u2026 They\u2019re worse than the martial sects in cultivation, and worse than the royal families in political influence, but they are surely able to live and breed in any situation\u2026 Even if someday the royal families are gone and the martial sects are destroyed, the noble clans will surely survive.\u201d\u201cThe royal families are ruling the world in a political way, but they are not capable of dealing with problems in the social aspect, so the noble clans are needed. The eight noble clans are settled in the three most powerful kingdoms in the world. It is actually a kind of balance \u2013 the balance between the imperial power and the noble clans.\u201d\u201cAll in all, the three groups are struggling against each other, yet they\u2019re simultaneously supporting each other. They won\u2019t make full cooperation; nor will they try to obliterate each other.\u201dYe Xiao frowned. He had reached a conclusion.He was sure that what he had conjectured was absolutely right!It could be compared to a lock with three keyholes.Each of the three groups held one key. Only when the three of them gave in their keys could the lock be opened.The problem was that they would never give in their keys.If they all gave in the keys and the lock was opened, there must be someone among them that should be taking charge. That meant there would be no value of existence for them.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI should be the lock. I should make use of them all and stay safe in the world, until I get strong enough. I won\u2019t need any key; I just need to make sure they will not use their keys and keep the lock sealed forever.\u201d\u2026Ye Xiao had just recovered from his thoughts. The bids for the Crystal Lotus had come to the last stage. The Mu Clan was still sticking on it and they had just outbid the last competitor. The Long Clan had quit because they couldn\u2019t offer a higher price.The price was now up to 27,500 silver bars.Ye Xiao smiled with disdain, and then he spoke loudly, \u201c50 thousand silver bars!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 39 \u2013 The Parvenu And The Crystal SandHearing Ye Xiao\u2019s latest bid, Mu Zi-He \u2013 the old man from the Mu Clan, looked up at the balcony with indistinct rage.Mu Zi-He had planned to seize the Crystal Lotus for himself with this opportunity that was given to him. He had thought that he would definitely be successful in getting the Crystal Lotus, and he could use it for his grandson who was about to be born. However, when he had finally won against all the other competitors, Ye Xiao popped up and doubled the price.\u201c75 thousand silver bars!\u201d Mu Zi-He took a deep breath and spoke loudly.He understood that only the people from the martial sects and the royal families were able to sit in the balcony. He was sure that it was better to not play dirty in this case. But he really wanted the Crystal Lotus, so he bid with a much higher price even though it was already out of his budget.\u201c150 thousand!\u201d Ye Xiao\u2019s voice was still peaceful and he just doubled it again.\u2013 Wow\u2026 \u2013The crowd burst into discussion.Everyone who had been waiting for the result turned their heads and looked towards the Ye Xiao\u2019s balcony with astonishment.They were already surprised, as 50 thousand silver bars was already an exaggerated price for the Crystal Lotus. However, now the price had even reached 150 thousand silver bars; it was an extremely irrational price that they couldn\u2019t even comprehend.Everyone was wondering who this lunatic parvenu was. Did he know the market price for the lotus, or was he just randomly raising the price?It was a whopping price indeed.Mu Zi-He became enraged and asked loudly, \u201cMay I have your name, the master in the 17th balcony? The Crystal Lotus is one thing we, the Mu Clan, have come for. We will make every effort to get it. If you are not so keen for it, could you please give it up this time?\u201dHe was combining both hard and soft tactics. He mentioned the Mu Clan so as to periphrastically show threats, while asking for a favor so as to give Ye Xiao a good reason to give up.People nodded, as they agreed with the old man\u2019s tactics.Ye Xiao sneered and thought, \u201cI may give it up if you Mu Clan don\u2019t want it. Besides, what you know about the Crystal Lotus is just a tiny bit of its properties. You are just a bunch of fools with a very limited outlook!\u201dThe Crystal Lotus was the main ingredient of the dan bead known as the \u2018limit-breaking dan\u2019 in the Qing-Yun Realm.Apparently the mortals knew nothing about this dan.But of course, Ye Xiao knew! How could he give up such great opportunity of getting the precious Crystal Lotus?If the Crystal Lotus was developed into the Bloodshot Lotus, it would become much more potent! Now that Ye Xiao had a spiritual space where the Crystal Lotus could be planted, he would never let the Crystal Lotus slip away\u2026Ye Xiao replied peacefully, \u201cWell, it is not that useful for me, but I just have to get it, because I want to play with it.\u201dMu Zi-He was extremely pissed.He shouted, \u201c175 THOUSAND SILVER BARS!\u201d With this bid, he had reached his limit. If he allocated too much money for the Crystal Lotus, he would fail his clan by reducing their chances of obtaining a supreme dan bead.Ye Xiao was still calm and spoke, \u201c250 thousand!\u201dHe looked calm and peaceful, but in fact, his insides were dancing with joy. He was doing exactly the same thing that Mu Cheng-Bai had done to him when they first met.\u201cIt actually feels so good to tease people with money!\u201d It was the first time that Ye Xiao had bullied anyone in this manner. He usually settled matters using his fists.It was a new experience for him to financially outmuscle the enemy so easily, and he was really enjoying this empowering feeling.Mu Zi-He couldn\u2019t bear it any longer, so he stood up and slapped the table as he shouted, \u201cWhat exactly do you want?\u201dThe crowd had sensed that something was wrong \u2013 that guy in the balcony was messing with the Mu Clan on purpose! Of course he was. Otherwise who would pay such huge amount of money for just a piece of Crystal Lotus?Ye Xiao answered leisurely, \u201cI don\u2019t want anything. I am just very wealthy \u2013 too wealthy\u2026\u201dHe sighed and continued, \u201cI feel sick of all the wealth\u2026 I think I should just spend as much as I can\u2026 to alleviate my burdens\u2026\u201dPeople who heard what he said all felt speechless and a bit disgusted.What kind of excuse was that?They all could feel that Ye Xiao was totally against the Mu Clan! He was fooling the old man willfully!The girl in white frowned and glanced at the balcony murmuring, \u201cMaster Feng? What is he doing? He is messing with the Mu Clan. Oh\u2026 Would he be related to the Ye Clan?\u201dMu Zi-He was quivering because of anger. He spoke, completely enraged, \u201cFine! You are a rich man. I am short for money at the moment. But I promise, we, the Mu Clan, will definitely do something to fix it after the auction!\u201dThe threat in what he had just said was obvious; everybody understood it.Ye Xiao sneered and said, \u201cFix it? Oh I am sooo scared\u2026 Ohhh, you really scared me. The Mu Clan, oh my god, is so fxxking powerful\u2026 Woohoo\u2026\u201dMu Zi-He was burning with rage. He sat back down on his chair and was breathing heavily.He hated Feng Zhi-Ling from the bottom of his heart. He felt pissed as well as disgraced.The next few rounds were some other tonics, which were quite important for the noble clans and the royal families. The princes and lords were busy bidding. The items had all been sold as expected.After that, a few powerful weapons and martial books were bought by the noble clans and the princes.Ye Xiao had noticed that Su Ye-Yue had won a martial book named Feng-Hua Swordplay.\u201cThe girl actually wants to practice swordplay? As I know, Feng-Hua Swordplay is a fine swordplay method book\u2026 I am not sure if it is exactly the book I had seen.\u201dYe Xiao thought.The atmosphere suddenly turned tense, as the most valuable items were about to be auctioned next, as it was the last few rounds.\u201cThe last seven items, as well as the best seven items will get here in a few seconds!\u201d Guan Wan-Shan was pleased. The auction had finally reached the most awaited part.The supreme dan bead was of course the last one to show up among the seven items.However, it didn\u2019t mean that the other six items were valued any lesser than the supreme dan. They were just different in kind and could not be compared. In fact, the other six items were all delivered from the head office to be auctioned alongside the supreme dan. They had used everything they could to record the maximum possible turnover.The martial sects were thrilled.\u201cThe first is\u2026 the Sky Crystal Sand!\u201d Guan Wan-Shan spoke loudly, \u201cThere are only 150 grams of the Sky Crystal Sand\u2026 but we all know of its wonderfulness! 15 grams of Sky Crystal in an ordinary weapon can turn the weapon into a legendary one! When the Sky Crystal Sand and the material of the weapon are mixed together, it shows a wonderful phenomena: When the weapon is used long enough, it can become a weapon with a spiritual attribute!\u201dGuan Wan-Shan smiled, \u201cWe all know that weapons with spiritual attributes have been very precious since ancient times! Now, the Sky Crystal Sand. Start with 50 thousand silver bars! Each bid raises 5 thousand!\u201dWhen Guan Wan-Shan just finished his words, a loud voice sounded, \u201cA hundred thousand silver bars!\u201dPeople were astonished.The voice was exactly the same voice that competed against the old man from the Mu Clan. That\u2019s right, it was Ye Xiao bidding in the 17th balcony.This time, he made the first bid.The Sky Crystal Sand was truly valuable. Even though he doubled the price right at the first bid, it was not sure that he would get it!As expected, on the other side, a man from the Long Clan made a bid after him, \u201c105 thousand.\u201dYe Xiao was still calm, and spoke peacefully with disdain, \u201c250 thousand then!\u201dHe didn\u2019t care about money at all.He had ten supreme dan beads waiting to be sold. The money he was going to earn from them was totally enough for him to maybe acquire every other item today! For Ye Xiao, money truly had no meaning right now. All he cared about was\u2026 to get whatever he wanted in the auction!The Sky Crystal Sand was one of the things he wanted badly!The price was not important; he didn\u2019t care!\u201cEven if I don\u2019t have enough money to pay for all my winning bids, I could rob every rich man in the capital tonight.\u201d Ye Xiao thought.As a man who had been living in the Qing-Yun Realm, he knew clearly that mortal money was just completely useless garbage!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euYe Xiao had been planning to return to the Qing-Yun Realm since the first day he got to this world.The man from the Long Clan gnashed, \u201c275 thousand\u2026\u201dHe didn\u2019t even finish his words, when he heard Feng Zhi-Ling speaking peacefully in the 17th balcony, \u201c500 thousand!\u201dHe spoke out the number easily like he would throw away a piece of paper on which he had wiped his snot.He was so freaking rich!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Does he actually know anything about an auction? He must be some super rich madman.\u201d\u201cWell if this lunatic wants something, none of us can outbid him. He is as rich as Croesus [1]! What can we do?\u201d\u201cCan we stop him from spending his own money?\u201dUsually, when the noble clans faced such a situation, they might\u2019ve considered using some violent tactics. But now that they were at such an important event, they hesitated. They didn\u2019t dare to do anything to make Ye Xiao stop bidding.The man from the Long Clan shot an angry glance at the balcony, before he sat back on his chair.Guan Wan-Shan smiled bitterly, as he had no idea what this Master Feng was planning. He then spoke loudly, \u201cFor the Sky Crystal Sand, 500 thousand silver bars. Calling once\u2026 Calling twice\u2026 Final call. No one? Deal!\u201d\u2013 Bam! \u2013The gavel went down.Ye Xiao had won the auction for the Sky Crystal Sand.Everyone was observing the man sitting at balcony No.17.The crowd quickly started to gossip, \u201cHe really is a bombshell. You\u2019ll never know when he\u2019ll explode.\u201d\u201cIt really doesn\u2019t matter what I bid for it, as long as he\u2019s interested in it, he\u2019ll just double my price. He truly doesn\u2019t care how much he\u2019ll end up paying. This is such a disgrace\u2026\u201d\u201cEven if I kill him after the auction, it won\u2019t save my reputation\u2026\u201d\u201cHe really gives me a headache\u2026\u201d\u201cWhere the hell did this moron come from? Is he some kind of a freak?\u201dEveryone felt displeased by the actions of this man.\u201cThe next item is the most legendary medicine, which is well known as the rarest in the world, the Regeneration Ink Lotus! It can heal severe diseases and legend says that it can even bring back people from the brink of death! It is truly a rare and almighty medicine!\u201d Guan Wan-Shan introduced the item.\u201cThis plant of the Regeneration Ink Lotus is three thousand years old. The branches and leaves have already turned partially opalescent\u2026 50 thousand silver bars will be the starting price for this treasure. Each subsequent bid will require a minimum increase of 5 thousand silver bars.\u201d Guan Wan-Shan just finished his words, when the crowd had already burst into another uproar.A plant of the Regeneration Ink Lotus with opalescent leaves could even heal the damaged soul of a world-class cultivator!If it turned completely opalescent, it would become a Regeneration Jade Lotus! One single leave of the Regeneration Jade Lotus could heal a deadly wound of a top-class cultivator of the Grade of Tianyuan in a mere second!There was nothing that came close in this mortal world to the healing power of this lotus!Guan Wan-Shan looked at balcony No.17, where Ye Xiao sat, and murmured in his head, \u201cMy lord\u2026 My dear lord\u2026 Please don\u2019t bid anymore. It must be very awkward if the auction is ruined by your hands.\u201dHowever, things went contrary to his wishes.Master Feng was the first to bid, \u201c250 thousand!\u201dGuan Wan-Shan felt a sudden headache. He started to wonder, \u201cAre you crazy?\u201dThe other attendants of this auction were also stunned, as expected. They figured that this guy would perhaps intent to collect every item in this world-class auction.Master Feng\u2019s bid was followed by a deadly silence.Guan Wan-Shan accepted that Ye Xiao was beyond his comprehension and thought, \u201cYou got me\u2026\u201dHowever, suddenly a voice from balcony No.7 sounded out, \u201c500 thousand!\u201dIt was the voice of a girl.Extreme shock spread throughout the auction hall, leaving people unable to even guess the gender of the person behind this voice. Only one thought was found inside the heads of the attendants: lunatics always show up in groups! And now this girl actually doubled Ye Xiao\u2019s price!People were gloating and thinking, \u201cFinally you\u2019ve found yourself a rich opponent.\u201dYe Xiao was surprised, but he quickly followed, \u201cOne million!\u201d\u201cOne million and five hundred thousand!\u201d The girl showed no hesitation whatsoever.\u201cTwo million!\u201d Ye Xiao frowned. In fact he was really keen on getting this item. He just wanted to plant it in his spiritual space. So he was rather frustrated by the determination of this girl. He had even completely lost his previously obtained delight.The girl didn\u2019t give up. She instantly followed, \u201cTwo and a half million!\u201d\u2013 \u2026 \u2013One would be able to hear a drop of sweat fall on the floor, as the salesroom was filled in utter silence!This was madness!They raised an item\u2019s price from 50 thousand silver bars to 2.5 million! They were absolutely insane!Ye Xiao was stunned by finding that a girl could actually be this crazy.The voice of the girl sounded from balcony No.7 again, \u201cMy dear friend from the No.17 balcony\u2026 please accept my apologies\u2026 I\u2019m not intentionally opposing you. My father has been seriously ill for many years and we couldn\u2019t find any cures, until now\u2026 Today I have to take this Regeneration Ink Lotus even if it will cost all my savings\u2026 I am not against you.\u201dThe girl spoke softly. It made people feel sympathetic towards her. Most people in the crowd were thinking, \u201cApparently you\u2019re not the one to be blamed.\u201dYe Xiao collected his thoughts and stayed quiet for a while.Two and a half million was truly too much to spend for Ye Xiao at this moment in time. After all, he still needed the money for other items, so he eventually decided to stop bidding.When everyone was expecting him to raise the price to five million, this arrogant man actually stopped\u2026 This was completely out of their expectation.When the gavel hit the table, people realised that the man in the No.17 balcony had truly given up\u2026\u201cThank you! Thank you all!\u201d The girl\u2019s voice was full of gratefulness, but still carried a hint of sadness, \u201cIf my father can revive from the disease, it is because of all your blessings.\u201dMany people felt satisfied and spoke aloud, \u201cMy pleasure.\u201dThe girl in white, who had fought against Ye Xiao earlier, was sitting in the No.1 balcony at the moment. She suddenly felt that she might make an enemy, \u201cIt turns out there is a girl who can actually be my opponent.\u201dShe couldn\u2019t help but look at the No.7 balcony.Here was a girl in cyan clothing sitting. A layer of silk covered half of her face. However, the gentleness she had shown everyone couldn\u2019t be observed in her eyes. They were sharp and cold.\u201cMaster\u2019s wound\u2026 Now, there is hope.\u201d The girl in cyan was thinking. She couldn\u2019t help glancing at the No.17 balcony, \u201cWho is this guy? He nearly stopped me\u2026 I only have notes for 3 million silver bars in total with me today. I was trying to get a supreme dan bead after the Regeneration Ink Lotus. Now that plan is impossible\u2026\u201d\u201cThat bastard has destroyed my plan!\u201d The girl in cyan gnashed her teeth and thought bitterly.After the scene of \u2018a girl trying to save her dying father\u2019 was over, the auction continued.There were six medicines being auctioned on the stage, one by one. Ye Xiao took all of them by doubling the starting price with his first bid!No one wanted to mess with him, as they thought him to be an extremely rich lunatic.They didn\u2019t wish to be disgraced, like the guy from the Mu Clan, in front of the public.As Master Feng had won most of the items, Guan Wan-Shan\u2019s face had turned pale!In fact, the items that were bought by Feng Zhi-Ling, were all done so in very low prices, except for the Crystal Lotus!Ye Xiao had doubled the starting price for every item, and nobody dared to bid after him, as they didn\u2019t want to be disgraced. It seemed fair\u2026However, when people thought deeper about it, they realised the problem. It looked like Ye Xiao had spent a lot for all these items, but in fact he had got very good deals, because no one dared to compete with him.He was so tricky!People felt angry when they figured the situation out.Finally, one of the leading items of this auction got to the stage. It instantly drew everyone\u2019s eyes.Two young lads carried a box onto the stage. Suddenly a stream of cold qi coiled around the stage. People could clearly feel that it was getting colder and colder. They couldn\u2019t help shivering with half-closed eyes.\u201cThe next item is a stone which has come from the far reaches of the universe. Its basis is the mysterious mythical metal \u2013 the Cosmic Hades!\u201d Guan Wan-Shan said.Everyone wore an expression which said \u2018I see\u2019 when they heard about \u2018the Cosmic Hades\u2019.No wonder it had drawn everyone\u2019s eyes.Some people smiled purposefully, \u201cIt\u2019s still on sale\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThis piece of Cosmic Hades has been producing extremely cold qi since it first landed in the world three thousand years ago. No matter what it was, everything within a radius of ten meters around it would be frozen!\u201dFeeling the coldness of the stone, Ye Xiao suddenly shook. He was slack-jawed.At that moment, the spiritual space inside his body had started to shake; this was something that had never happened before\u2026\u2026[1] Rich as Croesus \u2013 Croesus was an ancient Greek king whose wealth was legendary.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I Will Take It!Guan Wan-Shan said, \u201cI believe all of you know something about this item, so I don\u2019t want to say anything redundant. This item has been in our storage for hundreds of years already. We have failed countless times to discover its value and uses\u2026 If any of you want it, just bid for it. There will be no starting price for this item. Lets begin with it now.\u201dHe had just finished his words, and the crowd turned silent at once.Everyone recognized the infamous Cosmic Hades.It was truly a mysterious stone. No one would deny that it was quite a valuable thing. It would be an understatement to say that this was an ordinary treasure. Its mysteriousness alone would make it worth a lot.However, three thousand years had passed and not one person had figured out its functions!It couldn\u2019t be cut, crushed or melted.People basically couldn\u2019t figure out anything about this extremely cold stone.Well, some people had thought about using it as a cooling tool to maybe cool down the air and preserve some food and drinks in the summer. It might be a waste of its potential to use it for such a tiny job, but at least it would become somewhat useful!However, the problem was\u2026 the cold qi that it produced was not something ordinary. It was extremely frigid and aggressive. Even an expert at the Grade of Tianyuan would fail to bear the daily effects of this kind of qi. It might not only give people a setback in cultivation, but it might even permanently damage their bodies!Everyone knew that if it was successfully developed, it could become an extremely powerful weapon!However, they all had the same question in their minds\u2026Who would be able to develop it? And more importantly, How?Anyway, in the previous three thousand years, everyone that had tried to do so, had eventually failed. No progress had been seen and the question about its uses remained unanswered.Some of these people had actually died because of its extreme coldness. As time passed, people had become wary of its coldness and no one dared to solve the mystery of the Cosmic Hades. People didn\u2019t even want to get close to it.That was why, when it showed up, all of the people turned silent.The whole room turned silent, causing the atmosphere to become rather awkward.To Guan Wan-Shan\u2019s credit, he didn\u2019t show any nervousness. He just stood still on the stage.He had been nervous when the auctioning of the Jade Ruyi had brought silence, but it was a different situation this time. People would see it as a regular result if the Cosmic Hades was abortive. He wouldn\u2019t feel disgraced at all.In fact, the Ling-Bao Hall was just showing this item to go through the motions.Of course, it would be great if someone bid and took it, but if no one did, it could still calm the audience down.The Ling-Bao Hall felt a headache every time they thought about this item.It was truly something of little value or interest.There were some people who knew more about the stone.There was a story about Ling-Bao Hall and the Cosmic Hades, and it was the reason why they had to take it out for this auction.When Wan Zheng-Hao, the owner of the Ling-Bao Hall, had just begun to run his auction business, he had nothing really valuable to draw people\u2019s attentions for the salesroom. He was on a downturn.One day, this piece of Cosmic Hades suddenly showed up and it had really strange attributes. People didn\u2019t want to take a risk by keeping it, but Wan Zheng-Hao realized that it might be an opportunity for him. He was a determined guy, so he spent eighty percent of his property to obtain this stone.After that, his salesroom suddenly became famous. The name \u2018Cosmic Hades\u2019 had been spread far and wide since then.It was really something mysterious and fanciful, so as time went by, everybody got to know the Ling-Bao Hall.However, unexpectedly\u2026 every time after the stone had been sold, it was sent back to the salesroom. The same situation had happened dozens of times.In the last two hundred years, it had even been kept inside the storage of the salesroom and no one had ever asked about it.The salesroom had spent a fortune to buy a stone that nobody wanted. It was a big joke in many people\u2019s mind\u2026However, for the Ling-Bao Hall, it was a special treasure, but also the beginning of their great success and the leading item in their collection.So, for every grand auction, they would show the Cosmic Hades.They called it \u2018seeking the man with destiny\u2019.In fact, people all knew that they just wanted to get lucky and sell it.It might be of great use when the founder of the Ling-Bao Hall had just started the salesroom, so it was reasonable for him to spend such a great deal for it\u2026Now he had been right and had brought the salesroom the success!However, for the salesroom nowadays, it was just useless garbage.Besides, people saw it as a big joke. It had already become a burden.How ironic it was, that the thing, which had helped them the most at the beginning, had now become a joke\u2026Anyway, they couldn\u2019t just hide it or throw it away, because the whole world knew that it belonged to them. The only proper way to deal with it was to sell it to someone in front of the public.They bought it; they sold it. It sounded right.But it stuck with them. There never was any man \u2018with destiny\u2019!Guan Wan-Shan had felt upset when he got the order to take the stone out again.When he was just preparing to take it back and announce an abortive auction, he heard the voice of Master Feng sounding out from the No.17 balcony, \u201c250 thousand!\u201dGuan Wan-Shan didn\u2019t feel annoyed about this voice anymore; he felt grateful and pleased instead.He hadn\u2019t felt so grateful towards Feng Zhi-Ling, even when the latter had brought him the supreme dan beads.He was thinking, \u201cOh my good lord. You really are a good man. You just solved our biggest difficulty. I hope you will not send it back, brother Feng. I appreciate it sincerely!\u201dEveryone was looking at the No.17 balcony with expressions like \u2018he\u2019s a dickhead\u2019.\u201cDoes he know anything about the Cosmic Hades?\u201d\u201cHe actually spent 250 thousand on it?\u201d\u201cI think Guan Zheng-Hao had spent less than this amount on it in the old days.\u201d\u201cNo one has spent this much for that stone ever!\u201d\u201cHe really is a stupidly rich moron\u2026\u201d\u201cI thought he was smart to play tricks to buy things at the lowest prices possible. Oh, How wrong I was! I must\u2019ve seen it wrong!\u201dThe girl in white frowned and got lost in her thoughts for a while. She nearly decided to buy the stone for a moment, but changed her mind at the last moment.She didn\u2019t want to cause any accessorial trouble with this mysterious master Feng, especially since they had already been in a quarrel. Besides, she thought it\u2019d be profitless to keep a gelid stone around her master, as he was extremely weak at the moment.It was just a strange stone; she didn\u2019t want to fight for it.\u2026Ye Xiao was feeling quite different from the others; he was full of a form of excitement that he had never felt before.He had wanted to buy some valuable medicines or treasures in the auction to feed his spiritual space. In fact, he wouldn\u2019t have been interested in things like the Cosmic Hades.However, when the stone showed up and the whole room got cold, the space inside his body suddenly shook!And then he had a strong feeling of eagerness from deep within his spiritual space!The feeling of eagerness was even stronger than when he had been absorbing the Pure Heavenly Crystal!Ye Xiao was totally surprised about it!He could even sense the howling of eagerness from his spiritual space!What was that?Could it be that this Cosmic Hades was something even better than the Pure Heavenly Crystal? Anyway, It was surely something that could benefit his spiritual space.So Ye Xiao didn\u2019t hesitate and made a bid with the high price of 250 thousand!He knew that this stone, which was useless in other people\u2019s eyes, might be a key to a massive improvement for him!It might be a great moment in his life!This price was surely reasonable for him; it could even be higher and it wouldn\u2019t scare him!No one made an offer after Ye Xiao and Guan Wan-Shan had called it three times already.Ye Xiao got the Cosmic Hades without any complications.In the No.7 balcony, the girl in cyan was staring at the Cosmic Hades and her eyes were lit up. She turned her head and said, \u201cGo check on the No.17 balcony. Find out who that guy is, where he\u2019s from and what background he has.\u201dA middle-aged woman who was standing behind the girl said yes to her and stood up preparing to leave. The girl in cyan suddenly said, \u201cWait!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAt the same time, something was happening in the No.2 balcony.It was the Ling-Yun Sect that stayed in the No.2 balcony.Xiao Mo-Yan, a sage-like man with three long wisps of moustache, who was the hierarch of the Ling-Yun Sect, spoke peacefully, \u201cThis man\u2026 is not a fool at all. But why is he so confident? Does he know how to use that stone?\u201dThe other guy who was also sitting inside the No.2 balcony, the prime dan-maker of the Ling-Yun Sect spoke, \u201cThis guy is extraordinary. He has been controlling the whole situation in the auction today. He\u2019s playing tough when everybody is saving money for the supreme dan beads. He has already seized most of the valuable items. I would say that he has already become the winner of this auction\u2026\u201dXiao Mo-Yan\u2019s eyes were lit up. He spoke peacefully, \u201cThe only thing I care about, is that\u2026 this guy\u2026 seems to have no interests in the supreme dan beads\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Otherwise he won\u2019t spend lavishly like this. Anyway, the supreme dan beads are the main items in this auction. If he can\u2019t even get a single bead, then, even though he\u2019s obtained so many precious items, he\u2019ll still have lost at this auction. With the total amount he has spent so far for the previous items, if he was to bid for the supreme dan beads, there won\u2019t be anybody that can compete. It could\u2019ve been quite easy for him to win the supreme dan beads, but he has spent a huge amount of money without reservation\u2026 It is truly unreasonable for him to do so.\u201dXiao Mo-Yan frowned and spoke with a lower voice, \u201cIt is unreasonable indeed\u2026 In fact, could he be the guy who supplied the supreme dan beads? If so, it is reasonable, right?\u201dShi Yue\u2019s eyes immediately lit up. He looked at Xiao Mo-Yan and couldn\u2019t speak a word.They both turned silent at once.After a while Xiao Mo-Yan surprisingly stood up and walked out of the balcony, and then he spoke to the balcony No.17, \u201cMy friend in No.17, may I have your name please? Would you mind if I invite you to come and join me please?\u201dIf he was just a normal person, he\u2019d obviously get no answers in such circumstance.However, he was the hierarch of the Ling-Yun Sect \u2013 one of the top-3 sects in the Land of Han-Yang!His words were obviously important.The whole room suddenly turned silent.Some people turned their heads and looked at Xiao Mo-Yan.They were all curious, as to why Hierarch Xiao would show such kindness to this rich newcomer.Ye Xiao smiled and replied peacefully, \u201cHierarch Xiao, you and me, we are both guests. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to usurp the host\u2019s role.\u201dXiao Mo-Yan laughed and said, \u201cRight. It was my impudence. You are an outstanding man. Please come to my Ling-Yun Sect sometime. You\u2019re always welcome.\u201dYe Xiao smiled, \u201cFor your cordiality, I will come and visit you someday for sure.\u201dEveryone was shocked.\u201cDid Xiao Mo-Yan just invite that mysterious guy?\u201d\u201cWhy did he do so?\u201d\u201cOutstanding? I see nothing outstanding about that rich newcomer to be honest.\u201d\u201cI say he is just a mean rich newcomer! That\u2019s all.\u201dAnyway, there were also some people from the other sects who were lost in thought.At the moment, everyone had a strange feeling. They suddenly realized that everything in this auction had been related to this guy since the auction started!He hadn\u2019t even shown his face, but had already become the focus of this auction!Now, even the hierarch of a top-3 martial sect had given him an invitation in front of the public.They wondered if he really was only a rich newcomer?In the balcony No.7, the girl in cyan suddenly stood up and gracefully walked towards the door of balcony No.17. She slightly bowed and said, \u201cThank you for being lenient just now. It is your liberality that has allowed me to get the medicine for my father. May I ask your name please? I won\u2019t forget your great kindness.\u201dYe Xiao stayed silent for a while and then replied, \u201cI am Feng. I was trying to get that item you won. I just don\u2019t have enough money. I was not giving way to you. So it deserves no mentioning. Go back to your balcony, please.\u201d\u201cNonetheless, you\u2019ve done me a great favor. I won\u2019t forget your help.\u201d The girl in cyan took out a jade pendant and suddenly threw it out. \u2013 Shoot! \u2013 It flew into the balcony. She smiled and said, \u201cIf brother Feng comes to the Kingdom of Lan-Feng someday, the whole kingdom will welcome you sincerely!\u201dYe Xiao noticed a cyan light flashing in front of his eyes and then suddenly a warm jade pendant fell in his hands.The girl in cyan seemed to be the only person that Ye Xiao couldn\u2019t completely see through.He couldn\u2019t have known that this girl was from the Kingdom of Lan-Feng.He rubbed the pendant and then casually put it into his pocket.The girl in cyan waited for a moment and then smiled, \u201cI am off then.\u201d And then she went back to her balcony.On the other side, the girl in white spoke softly, \u201cThat girl is truly unusual!\u201dThe two fellows in black that stood behind said nothing, but showing doubtful looks and thinking, \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cShe acted like she was such an innocent and nice person. She had just built up a nice image of herself in a perfect way, right after she had acted like a baleful bidder. She acts like she was weak. That is truly estimable and also horrible. Especially when she started to realize the importance of that guy, she took her action right away. Do you know how hard it is to do such a thing for a girl in front of the public? Besides, as she dared to make such an invitation, she must be someone important in the Kingdom of Lan-Feng. It is even more frightening, as she is an important person in a big kingdom.\u201dThe girl in white was vigilant suddenly, \u201cIn all these years, I\u2019ve never met anyone who\u2019s as cunning and vigorous as that girl. She is even good enough to be my opponent.\u201dOne fellow then asked doubtfully, \u201cHow come I couldn\u2019t see how good she was. I think she was kind of disgraceful to do such a thing. She had just been bidding fiercely against that guy, and then she suddenly realized that he was some important man, so she went to talk to him with flattery. I feel disdain towards her. How could such a foolish girl be your opponent my lady?\u201d\u201cThe \u2018disdain\u2019 of yours exactly shows the devilishness of her!\u201dThe girl in white humped and said, \u201cBesides\u2026 what was to be disgraced with that? She was masked with silk. Look at her perfect body. She must be a beauty.\u201d\u201cWell, she will regret if she finds out that the man is of no use at all.\u201d The man in black sneered.\u201cAccept it when I call you a moron. If he is useless, the girl only loses a jade pendant. It is nothing but a keepsake. But if this Feng is really some extraordinary man, then what she just gave him will become a bridge connecting them together! Maybe it will bring her some surprising profits someday! If you still can\u2019t understand it, after I\u2019ve told you this much\u2026 so be it.\u201d The girl in white looked disappointed.She thought, \u201cMaster educates these guys. Some of them may be good fighters, but few of them are clear-sighted\u2026\u201dThe girl in white suddenly spoke loudly, \u201cThe lady in cyan, please, may I ask your name?\u201dThe girl in cyan was turning to her balcony when she heard it. She answered, \u201cHow do you do, sister. Wen-Ren is my family name, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re familiar with it. You are so beautiful my sister. You must have a beautiful name.\u201dThe girl in white smiled, \u201cSister Wen-Ren, you can call me sister Xiu-Er.\u201d\u201cSister Xiu-Er, let\u2019s find another place to drink some tea together later.\u201d The girl in cyan smiled sweetly and bowed humbly, and then she entered her own balcony.Xiu-Er smiled gently and her eyes lit up, \u201cWen-Ren\u2026 It\u2019s the name of the royal family in the Kingdom of Lan-Feng\u2026\u201dA meaningful smile appeared on her face.When the girl in cyan was back to her balcony, the middle-aged woman asked nervously, \u201cMy lady, why did you give them your name? Wasn\u2019t it too obvious?\u201dThe girl smiled softly and answered, \u201cI just came back to this world\u2026 I guess I need to show myself a bit to the world\u2026 The situation is not good for our kingdom at present times\u2026\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m afraid\u2026 that the Kingdom of Chen will come and harm you.\u201d The middle-aged woman spoke.\u201cIf so\u2026\u201d The girl in cyan smiled softly and said, \u201cLet them try, I\u2019ll have my sword in my hand when they come\u2026 My sword has slaughtered over three million people\u2026\u201d\u2026The salesroom finally turned silent again.People started to turn their attentions from the mysterious Feng Zhi-Ling to the auction itself.The last item of the auction was finally coming!The two men of the Mu Clan were showing dark faces.As the guy they hated and had planned to kill had actually aroused so much attention, they thought that it wouldn\u2019t be easy to kill him now. They felt upset.On the stage, Guan Wan-Shan finally recovered from his gloomy mood.In fact he should be the one who had the most to complain.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThis Feng Zhi-Ling had been asking to keep himself low. Now he had suddenly popped out in front of the public and drawn everyone\u2019s attention! Guan Wan-Shan had been planning to keep the resource of the supreme dan beads to himself. But now, it was mostly assured that he had failed\u2026\u201cIf you want to flaunt yourself, then why did you act so mysteriously? I have been covering you for such a long time and now you just showed the entirety of your ass\u2026\u201d He thought.He only managed to regain control over his emotions, when the supreme dan beads were brought onto stage and he saw how the crowd was full of tenseness and eagerness.\u201cThe next item is the last item in today\u2019s auction!\u201d Guan Wan-Shan laughed. His goatee was almost tilted up, \u201cI think you all know that it is exactly the legendary supreme dan beads with dan clouds, that you have never seen before!\u201dHe laughed and continued, \u201cTo be honest, it is the first time for me to see such a great treasure, even though I have lived for such a long time.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I have struck the gavel thousands of times. However, it is my first time introducing such a dan in an auction. It is only a middle class dan, but it is of an unbelievably high quality.\u201dUpon hearing Guan Wan-Shan\u2019s words, especially the fact that the middling dan possessed such a high quality, many people subconsciously smiled.It was definitely the first time!The Pei Yuan Dan.[Editor\u2019s note: Pei Yuan, \u57f9\u5143 refers to the training of the chakra core.]From the perspective of an ordinary person, this kind of dan medicine was truly marvelous. Just one piece could heal nearly all illnesses and strengthen one\u2019s physical condition. However, this was only true for ordinary people.For cultivators, while the Pei-Yuan dan was not the lowest class of dan medicine, it was rather close to that level. Strictly speaking, by stating that it was a \u2018middle class\u2019 medicine, Guan Wan-Shan was actually overpraising it!As its name suggested, Pei-Yuan Dan was merely a kind of normal dan, that the sects gave to their rookies to strengthen their bodies and train in the initial steps of their cultivation. Once they had built a solid foundation, there was no longer any need for such low-level medicine.Basically, it was a valuable thing for ordinary people, but garbage for cultivators.However, it was precisely this lowly medicine, that had abruptly been refined to such a level that it was even radiating the legendary dan clouds!This was something no one had ever seen before.\u201cUsually, we identify items on our own, but today, for this legendary treasure, please allow me to invite the Patriarch of the Ling-Yun Sect \u2013 Xiao Mo-Yan, presbyter of the Cang-Shan Sect \u2013 Li Chang-Qing and presbyter of the Qing-Yun Sect \u2013 Meng Wu-Fei on stage to judge the item.\u201d Guan Wan-Shan bowed respectfully.These three men, which even included the Patriarch of a major Sect, were the most powerful men in this room at the moment.None of them hesitated, as they immediately made their way onto the stage.When faced with such a legendary item, the chance to examine it from close up, was of course, largely advantageous.A purple jade bottle, that had a soft glow, was placed on an intricate platform.Under the watchful gazes of the spectators, Guan Wan-Shan cautiously opened the bottle. Immediately a white mist rushed out from inside the bottle.Although the purple jade bottle itself was opaque, the moment it was opened, it glittered with a mesmerising bright light. The next moment, the entire bottle had turned almost transparent. Everyone in the auction hall could clearly see the single bead of dan medicine contained within the bottle.It was precisely the dan medicine that was radiating the warm and bright light, that pierced even the walls of the opaque bottle. This scene had captured the attention of everyone in the audience.Even though light was supposed to be blocked from exiting or entering this bottle, this supreme dan bead\u2019s mystical glow had actually managed to penetrate through the walls of this bottle.The white mist, that had gushed out from the bottle, coalesced above the bottle, forming a thin layer of fog. Unexpectedly, instead of dissipating, this fog was actually accumulating, both in size and in density. Gradually, a cloud about two meters in diameter was formed over the bottleAs the mist continued to rush out of the bottle, the cloud continued to expand. It didn\u2019t seem to have even the slightest intention of scattering.The next moment, a delicate and light fragrance started to spread throughout the room. Although the fragrance was subtle, it had instantly permeated the entire auction hall. Anyone who inhaled it, felt their spirits being lifted, as the smell refreshed and relaxed them.Within moments of its appearance, the delicate fragrance had already entranced the entire audience.\u201cThis smell\u2026 This is absolutely from a supreme dan from the heavens!\u201dThe prime dan-maker of the Ling-Yun Sect, Shi Yue, trembled, as he gazed at the bottle that contained the dan bead, on the platform. An extreme obsession could be seen in his eyes, while his face had already turned into a deep red color.He looked like he wanted to immediately rush onto stage, hug the bottle to his chest and never let go!A dan bead with a dan cloud like this, was something he had dreamed of his entire life.To refine a dan bead to this extent, it truly represented the peak of the field of dan-making! No one could surpass that!Li Chang-Qing, Xiao Mo-Yan and Meng Wu-Fei, who were standing the closest to the dan bead, were also shocked!The mystical dan cloud, that no one had seen for almost ten thousand years, actually existed in the real world?And it was right here in front of their eyes!In front of the greed-filled gazes of the three men, Guan Wan-Shan capped the bottle. Only after the bottle was sealed did the cloud above began to waver. It slowly dissipated, scattering into white mist that travelled in all directions.When the dan cloud finally disappeared, Guan Wan-Shan unexpectedly opened the bottle again. As pristine dan energy surged out from the bottle once more, a dan cloud began to form.This action greatly angered people that worked in the field of dan-making, as they stared at him like they were about to rip him apart.Wasn\u2019t this bastard purposely destroying the dan bead?\u201cLadies and gentlemen, please calm down. I am not intentionally damaging the supreme dan bead. I just wanted to double check the dan cloud. This dan bead is truly a wonder! Normally, the effectiveness of dan beads will disappear bit by bit when they\u2019re exposed to light, but this dan bead here, can actually absorb natural energy from its surroundings. As long as it hasn\u2019t been consumed, the efficiency will stay full anytime, anywhere! In other words, this supreme dan bead has created its own small circulation system within the world.\u201dGuan Wan-Shan sighed, \u201cBefore this, I believe that nobody would have expected the dan medicine to have such an ability. It has never even been recorded in the dan-making recipes. This is truly the first time, that it has been seen entering this world. The first mystical dan with dan clouds!\u201dAs people exclaimed in wonder, the auction room instantly turned as noisy as a marketplace.So it was actually such a marvelous item!The eagerness of the people to get their hands on that bead had multiplied several times.Guan Wan-Shan was truly a seasoned expert in holding auctions.With just a few sentences, he had successfully driven the ambiance of the room through the roof!But what he had said was entirely true \u2013 Indeed, this function of the dan bead was something nobody had known about. In fact, people couldn\u2019t even begin to imagine its existence!The three men on stage slowly nodded.The eyes of the dan-makers in the room lit up with intense greedy light. They were akin to old perverts, who had been starved of sex for three hundred years, before suddenly seeing a gorgeous beauty lying naked on their beds\u2026\u201cIf someone could extract this special refining technique and apply it to some higher-level dan\u2026\u201d Guan Wan-Shan rubbed his mustache and said, \u201cThat would be a grand achievement. That will not only bring us more chances to avoid death, it will also greatly increase our profits\u2026\u201dGuan Wan-Shan\u2019s continued musings made some people so angry they felt like cursing.The people who were permitted entrance to this auction hall, none of them were fools. How could they not understand what Guan Wan-Shan was actually trying to do?This bastard, was he trying to raise the price of the dan bead to the heavens?But among the audience, the dan-makers were all breathing heavily, their eyes bloodshot! Indeed, this was certainly a peerless treasure they would spend their whole lives chasing after!After sealing the bottle again, Guan Wan-Shan lips curved into a reserved smile, \u201cThank you, our three valued guests. Please exit the stage and return to your seats. Our auction for the supreme dan beads will begin right away.\u201dFrom the No. 2 balcony, Shi Yue suddenly yelled, \u201cPray tell, Master Guan. About this supreme dan, how many beads are to be auctioned today?\u201dIn fact, it was the question that had been weighing heavily on everyone\u2019s minds, so they all turned quiet and waited for the answer.The supreme dan bead was definitely a treasure, but they still needed to know how many beads there were.If there was only one, then\u2026 it would be immensely difficult for most people to acquire it. In that case, many of them might quit the auction before it even began.Guan Wan-Shan laughed and answered, \u201cTruthfully, it would already be extremely lucky for all of us to see even this one bead, as it is such a marvelous treasure\u2026\u201dWhen the audience heard his words, they instantly became incredibly anxious. Some small sects felt like giving up immediately. Even people who belonged to powerful groups had turned pale, as it would surely be a tough fight for them, if there was only one bead.Surprisingly, Guan Wan-Shan continued his words, \u201cBut luckily, we have more than one supreme dan bead at today\u2019s auction. You definitely won\u2019t be disappointed\u2026\u201dThe spectators\u2019 spirits instantly lifted. Did that mean there were more beads? If there were a large number of supreme beads auctioned today, there might be less competition and they might even spendwalk away with a much smaller hole in their purses\u2026But Guan Wan-Shan added, \u201c\u2026But still, there aren\u2019t that many supreme beads.\u201dImmediately, everyone in the hall felt like their hearts had been trampled by ten thousand alpacas.[Editor\u2019s note: Interesting fact \u2013 the Chinese term for alpaca is \u8349\u6ce5\u9a6c which sounds similar to \u8349\u4f60\u5988, or fxxk your mother, so it\u2019s often used as a slang replacement.]They wanted to drag the old bastard down from the stage and give him a good beating.They felt, that the way in which he kept playing with the suspense in the room, was really annoying.\u201c\u2026You all want one but that is definitely not going to happen\u2026\u201d Guan Wan-Shan smiled slyly, \u201cAfter all, everything is priced in proportion to its rarity.\u201dEveryone tried hard to quell the itch in their hearts, the impulse to beat someone up.This bastard, is he trying to play us to death?\u201cMaster Guan, just how many supreme dan beads are there? Tell us the exact number.\u201d Xiao Mo-Yan frowned and spoke.With his status as a Patriarch, he had been reluctant to ask, as he needed to present a calm exterior. However, since the Ling-Yun Sect was mainly committed to dan-making, the supreme dan was especially important to him. Moreover, since the question had come directly from a person as important as him, Guan Wan-Shan would have to answer.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOtherwise, if the number of beads remained unclear, people would fight amongst themselves for the beads, until their wallets became completely empty.Ye Xiao leisurely crossed his legs. He sat in balcony No. 17, as still as a stone, and overlooked the whole scene.\u201cOf course. If it is the Patriarch Xiao that wants to know it, I will absolutely give my answer.\u201d Guan Wan-Shan humbly said, \u201cThe supreme dan with dan clouds. This time, we have truly done everything we can, but we\u2019ve only managed to obtain ten beads.\u201dThe crowd burst into an uproar!Ten supreme dan beads!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In fact, it had already exceeded most of the people\u2019s expectations!However, for the people who eagerly desired these supreme dan beads, it was never enough!There were at least a hundred groups, who were determined to win the supreme dan beads!But there were only ten\u2026 What could they do about that?One by one, they started to check their wallets\u2026Xiao Mo-Yan breathed a sigh of relief before becoming a little nervous. Since there were ten beads, it was guaranteed that he would get a least one but\u2026 In order to attain just that one bead would require him to triumph through a bloody competition by paying a sizeable amount!\u201cNext, we shall begin the auction for the first supreme dan bead!\u201d Guan Wan-Shan stood on the stage, looking energetic and high-spirited. \u201cThe starting price is 100 thousand silver bars! Each overbid requires a minimum increase of 25 thousand!\u201dThe moment he said that, a hush fell over the audience.For a long, long time, nobody replied.Of course it wasn\u2019t because the beads were unwanted but rather, people were calculating silently. To be the first Sect to bid, how much would be suitable?Finally, Meng Wu-Fei of the Qing-Yun Sect frowned and spoke loudly, \u201c150 thousand from OUR QING-YUN SECT!\u201dWhen he heard what Meng Wu-Fei said, Guan Wan-Shan immediately furrowed his brows. Within the No.17 balcony, Ye Xiao felt as though he was constipated with a stomach full of shit. Many people were also cursing inside their minds.\u201cIf you wanted to bid, then just bid! What\u2019s with the emphasis on \u201cOUR QING-YUN SECT\u201d?!\u201dWhat did he mean?Well, the nuance was clear. It was definitely a threat!The way he phrased it, if someone dared to compete against him in the bidding, then they would make enemies out of the entire Qing-Yun Sect! You could weigh the consequences yourself.As expected, after that sentence from Meng Wu-Fei, no one dared to bid anymore. No matter what, it was just not an intelligent move to mess with the Qing-Yun Sect. Even Xiao Mo-Yan sat quietly without a word.The high-spirited and vigorous Guan Wan-Shan felt like he had eaten a bittergourd.As calculative as he might be, he had forgotten to account for how shameless these powerful Sects could be.\u201cMaster Meng from the Qing-Yun Sect bids 150 thousand. Are there anymore bids? Anyone\u2026\u201d Guan Wan-Shan forced the words out, all while silently cursing in his heart. \u201c150 thousand once\u2026 Anyone? 150 thousand twice\u2026 150 thousand\u2026\u201d\u201c500 thousand!\u201d From above, a loud voice resounded.It was Ye Xiao.There was no way that the Xiao Monarch could bear his supreme dan being sold at such a low price.\u201cSince you\u2019ve dared to act so shamelessly in front of everyone, then I won\u2019t hesitate to make trouble for you!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re dealing with my belongings; I won\u2019t permit them to be taken away at such a cheap price!\u201dMeng Wu-Fei\u2019s expression darkened as he swivelled around to face the direction of the voice.Ye Xiao pushed opened the door of the balcony No.17 and said blandly, \u201cTo be honest, I am not that interested in this supreme dan. I wasn\u2019t even going to bid. But to see someone trying to snatch this supreme dan for just 150 thousand, how blasphemous! You desecrate this treasure. Moreover, this trade should be fair; I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re a from the royal family, major Sect or noble clan. The moment you arrive here, you must follow the rules! Using your power to bully others, how despicable can you be! So, Master Meng, it won\u2019t be that simple. If you want it, you better be prepared to pay what it deserves. Otherwise I will be the first one to challenge you!\u201dNarrowing his eyes, Meng Wu-Fei spoke coldly, \u201cYou\u2019ve definitely got balls, Mr. Feng. But who the hell are you?\u201dThe underlying message was clear: \u201cA nobody like you, how dare you try to stop me from taking what I want?\u201dYe Xiao held his head high and replied calmly, \u201cI may be just a nobody. But, I am the original owner of these supreme dan beads!\u201dEveryone who heard his words were immediately stunned!\u201cThe owner of the supreme dan beads!\u201d\u201cHe is the owner of the supreme dan beads!\u201d\u201cNo wonder he was trying so hard to collect all those valuable medicines. He is a supreme dan-maker!\u201dThe girl in white \u2013 Xiu Er, the girl in cyan, people from the martial sects and people from the noble clans\u2026 All of them turned their gazes up towards him.Ye Xiao narrowed his eyes as he casually glanced at the people from the Mu Clan. \u201cPerhaps with my status as a supreme dan-maker, I can destroy those bastards from the Mu Clan?\u201dMeng Wu-Fei\u2019s expression instantly turned ugly as he replied, \u201cEven if you\u2019re the owner of these supreme dan, what can you possibly do?\u201d\u201cWell, I suppose the owner of these supreme dan can\u2019t really do much.\u201d Ye Xiao replied leisurely, \u201cBut for my supreme dan to have been sullied in this auction, I am truly disappointed, so I can choose to take back my supreme dan beads. Regarding other people\u2019s items, I don\u2019t have a say nor can I promise anything. But I can assure you \u2014 From today onwards, there will be no more supreme dan in this world!\u201dHe bared his teeth as he grinned, \u201cOnce I retrieve them, I will swallow all ten beads. If they are to be desecrated, I would rather have these beads cease existing!\u201dThat moment, everyone stared at him with wide eyes, unable to make a sound!This bastard was not only a supreme dan-maker, but also a supreme troublemaker.If he was not satisfied, he would destroy everything!\u201cIf you really want the supreme dan bead, then bid according to the rules. Ten is not a small number. If you offer a suitable price, you\u2019ll naturally be able to get one.\u201d Ye Xiao spoke calmly, \u201cUnder no circumstances are you to use your power to oppress others. If I see anyone do that again, this auction will end instantly!\u201dMeng Wu-Fei\u2019s face turned green.The two men who stood beside him had their hands pressed to the hilt of their swords. Their eyes, full of killing intent, were fixed at Ye Xiao.But all three of them knew that since this Master Feng had exposed his identity as the \u2018owner of the supreme dan\u2019, they couldn\u2019t do anything to him under these circumstances!In fact, even in the future, this kind of person was definitely not to be offended!For a supreme dan-maker as powerful as he was, just how much resources did he truly harbour?It was just unimaginable!Not to mention only the three of them, even the entire Qing-Yun Clan could not hope to bear his wrath!He could turn the Qing-Yun Sect into everyone\u2019s enemy by simply saying something like \u2018I will make dan for the one who destroys the Qing-Yun Sect\u2019.Meng Wu-Fei took a few deep breaths and forced a smile, \u201cYou definitely do not mince words. How admirable. But I am afraid there has been some miscommunication between us. When I offered 150 thousand just now, I was only testing the waters. It would truly be a desecration if the supreme dan bead was sold at only 150 thousand. If anyone wishes to bid, of course they are free to do so. With my status, how can I possibly forcibly oppress the market like this\u2026 Since Brother Feng has called for 500 thousand, then I shall follow. 750 thousand please.\u201dMeng Wu-Fei managed to restrain himself enough to spit out those words.\u201cI\u2019ll have my revenge another day.\u201dEveryone spectating this scene couldn\u2019t help but breathe a sigh of relief. By taking a step back this time, Meng Wu-Fei had brought shame to the Qing-Yun Sect. But had he not submitted, the Qing-Yun Sect would not only have ended up empty handed today, but also possibly face an even bigger disaster in the future!Although Meng Wu-Fei had retreated, no one would really looked down on him. Instead, his forbearance had gathered quite some admiration. After all, it had been the owner of the supreme dan he had been facing!\u201cHmm, one million!\u201d Li Chang-Qing from the Cang-Shan Sect spoke measuredly.\u201cOne million and 50 thousand!\u201d Meng Wu-Fei bidded instantly.Ye Xiao finally stayed quiet.The price had gone over one million now\u2026 and it was still rising.He was not delighted in the least at the moment; instead he was bleeding in his heart. There had been 15 dan beads in total and he had actually sold 5 of them to the salesroom for 100 thousand each\u2026\u201cI really want to jump off a building\u2026 How could I have miscalculated to incur such a loss\u2026\u201dHe had lost five million! At least!\u201cOh my god\u2026 So much money! Let me die!\u201dWhile Ye Xiao was still drowning in his sorrow, Xiao Mo-Yan finally bid.\u201cOne million and 250 thousand!\u201d\u201cOne million and 275 thousand!\u201d Meng Wu-Fei gritted his teeth.\u201cOne million and 300 thousand!\u201d\u201cOne million and 325 thousand!\u201dMeng Wu-Fei was nearly going to vomit blood.He had to win the bid for this supreme dan bead, otherwise it would really be a huge disgrace after the scuffle between him and Ye Xiao just now.In the end, for the price of one million and 400 thousand silver bars, Meng Wu-Fei acquired the first supreme dan bead!After seeing just a high price, all the spectators were shocked out of their minds.Although Meng Wu-Fei had brought this fate upon himself, this price of one million and 400 thousand silver bars was truly unreasonably high.After that, the second supreme dan bead was sold for one million and 250 thousand to Xiao Mo-Yan.The third was sold to Li Chang-Qing for the same price as the second one.Till now, the top three martial sects had gotten one of the first three supreme dan beads each. One could say that they had accomplished their most important task of today.The others bidders breathed a sigh of relief. They all understood that the first three supreme dan beads would never be theirs. No matter what, they would definitely be seized by the top three sects. Whoever encroached upon these beads would only bring enormous trouble to their own groups.But still\u2026 the prices had still been pushed so high that many of the groups had already felt depressed.Within just a few turnovers, the numbers had already risen way beyond the levels of what they could compete with.When the fourth dan bead was up, people subconsciously understood that the top three sects wouldn\u2019t bid again, so one by one, they started to bid!\u201c850 thousand.\u201d\u201c875 thousand!\u201d\u201c900 thousand\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAlthough the prices continued to rise, it had already started slowing down. It was no longer the scorching battle that accompanied the first three beads. When Mu Zi-He from the Mu Clan bid 950 thousand, no one made a sound anymore.All of them were thinking that if the prices were able to lessen even further, that would undeniably be a good thing.Some experts like Guan Wan-Shan had already predicted that the price would be no higher than one million this time.But right at that moment, the clear and cold voice of a girl suddenly resounded loudly, \u201cOne million and 250 thousand!\u201dWith this shout, she had raised the price up to the price levels of the former three dan beads straightaway!Such a price had immediately defeated most of the bidders!As the audience turned their heads towards the voice, they realised that it was in fact, the girl in white.When they found out that the bidder was a girl, they were instantly angry. \u201cPreviously, we didn\u2019t want to offend the three major sects so we didn\u2019t join the bidding. A little girl like you, who do you think you are?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euMu Zi-He, in particular, was ready to explode with rage!\u201cWhy on earth is there always someone messing with me? Am I a pushover to them?\u201d\u201cThis time, there is no way I could bear such humiliation again! If I continue to tolerate this, our Mu Clan will be known as the clan of cowardly turtles\u2026\u201d[TL: \u7f29\u5934\u4e4c\u9f9f literally means turtles who retreat back into their shells when facing danger.

And now when I bid for the supreme dan bead, somebody wants to snatch it again? Do I look that easy to bully?\u201dEven a clay figurine could only take so much, let alone an elder of the Mu Clan, one of the eight noble clans!The girl in white, Xiu Er, didn\u2019t even bat an eye as she blandly replied, \u201cOne million and 350 thousand.\u201dMu Zi-He looked at her with a sullen look. His eyes were filled with a scary warning as he said, \u201cOne million and 400 thousand!\u201dXiu Er was not moved in the least as she calmly said, \u201c One and a half million!\u201dThe auction grounds were filled with commotion.It had reached one and a half million already!The number had already exceeded the final price of the first three supreme dan beads.Even Ye Xiao who was sitting in the upper floor felt shocked when he heard the price.He had never imagined that this girl in white was actually that wealthy\u2026It seemed like the Mu Clan was about to kick against another iron board.Ye Xiao looked around him.Faced with such a bold, disrespectful challenge, Mu Zi-He couldn\u2019t hold back his fury. He stood up and yelled out loudly, \u201cThis woman! This challenge\u2026! Are you purposely trying to make the Mu Clan lose face?\u201dHe had just been thoroughly humiliated by Feng Zhi-Ling not long ago. And then his identity as the owner of the supreme dan beads was exposed and Mu Zi-He had to forcibly quash his burning desire for revenge. Just as his stomach felt like it was filled to the brim with rage, he was slapped in the face by another unreasonably high price!All the anger that he had been barely managing to hold back, exploded towards Xiu Er.\u201cThe Mu Clan? To struggle like this\u2026!\u201d Xiu Er looked at him indifferently and said softly, \u201cThis is an auction; we bid for what we want. We\u2019re competing in a fair way. Whoever bids the highest price, gets the item. I didn\u2019t think this had anything to do with losing face\u2026\u201dAs she said this, all of the people present thought that the girl was going to back off.However as Xiu Er continued speaking, her tone suddenly changed. Coldly, she continued, \u201cBut, if this member of the Mu Clan believes that I am purposely humiliating you\u2026 Then let\u2019s just say that that was my intention.\u201dThe underlying meaning of her words, was that the prestige of the Mu Clan was worth nothing to her.Her words made a huge impact on the audience, as people were immediately shocked!That was really\u2026 unfathomable.This girl in white, just who was she?Was she just bragging, or was she purposely trying to mystify herself? Or perhaps\u2026 Did she really come from a powerful background?From above, Ye Xiao saw his opportunity and appealed, \u201cPlease allow me to advise the lady to be cautious. The Mu Clan is one of the eight noble clans. Before a lady does anything rash, it\u2019d be prudent to think it over. Sometimes, it isn\u2019t unacceptable to take a step back, since it\u2019s the Mu Clan after all\u2026\u201dWhat he just said seemed well-intentioned.Moreover, it seemed that he was raising the prestige of the Mu Clan.Although Mu Zi-He was angry with him, but at this moment, he gratefully nodded to show that he accepted the kindness.The girl in white, Xiu Er, replied softly, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, brother Feng. I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201dYe Xiao worriedly continued, \u201cBut\u2026 Lady, do you really think so little of the Mu Clan? This is\u2026 The Mu Clan is truly powerful. I am afraid that you can\u2019t afford to mess around with them\u2026\u201dAs he finished speaking, everyone turned their suspicious gazes towards him.This bastard\u2026 Wasn\u2019t it a little too obvious that he was provoking dissension?As expected, Xiu Er smiled slightly, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, brother Feng. In front of me, the prestige of the Mu Clan really isn\u2019t worth even a single penny.\u201dYe Xiao rubbed his nose, sat back down and didn\u2019t say anything more.\u201cThat will do\u2026 If even such words can\u2019t induce a fight and create mutual hatred, I\u2019ll knock my head against the wall! If these fellows from the Mu Clan don\u2019t crash and burn, it\u2019ll really be a waste of my careful effort in stirring up this conflict\u2026\u201d\u201cFxxking assholes. Since you, the Mu Clan, is this unreasonable and purposely messed with me, then of course, I shall create some troubles for you.\u201dAs expected, what the girl in white said was like adding fuel to the fire. Things had already degenerated beyond repair.\u201cHmm.\u201d The girl in white thought, \u201cThis guy is obviously against the Mu Clan and wants me to pull the trigger. Anyway\u2026 Since you\u2019re the owner of the supreme dan beads, I\u2019ll show you some respect and go along with your schemes.\u201d\u201cBesides\u2026 this Mu Zi-He dared to rebuke me in front of the public. I really should teach him a lesson.\u201d \u2014 It had to be said, that the hearts of girls were truly difficult to decipher.After hearing her words, Mu Zi-He was quivering in anger. His wrath had already reached its peak as he yelled, \u201cBitch! How dare you look down upon the Mu Clan! I swear I will\u2026\u201dGuan Wan-Shan naturally knew about the status of the girl, so he couldn\u2019t just sit back and watch anymore. Interrupting Mu Zi-He, he spoke hurriedly \u201cBrother Mu\u2026\u201dMu Zi-He was boiling with anger and snarled, \u201cGuan Wan-Shan, you\u2019re just a servant in a salesroom. What makes you think you can call me brother! You\u2019re unqualified to open your mouth at the moment!\u201dHe was obviously lost in the flames of his anger and started to bite people like a mad dog.He had already been pissed off multiple times during his stay in the capital. The Mu Clan had gone for revenge at the beginning, but had failed and had even lost eight of their expert cultivators. While they had been preparing for their next attempt to settle the revenge, the auction had begun. So they had struggled to restrain their anger, but their stomachs were filled with dissatisfaction which had not yet abated.He had been in a bad mood even before the start of the auction.And when he came to the auction with his son, his son had even embarrassingly stumbled in front of the audience, losing face in front of everyone. Then the owner of the supreme dan beads had humiliated them and snatched all of the sold medicines. Moreover, they had been oppressed by the three major sects all along\u2026 He hadn\u2019t even dared to consider bidding for the first three dan beads\u2026And now, he was being scorned by a little girl. Mu Zi-He completely exploded with anger!He was in hysterics, stomping the ground with fury!Guan Wan-Shan\u2019s face turned purple when he heard Mu Zi-He\u2019s words. He had originally wanted to be kind in advising the Mu Clan against their actions. However, he had never thought that his attempt at kindness would result in him being bitten by a mad dog. It was like he had suffered a huge warm fart right in the face!He instantly felt his head heat up, as he didn\u2019t know how to reply to this insult.So he stayed silent and thought, \u201cMu Zi-He, you will definitely regret this. You\u2019ve got absolutely no idea, just who the girl you are messing with truly is and who is backing her!\u201dAs expected, Mu Zi-He\u2019s bodnegetivey trembled as he shot a wide-eyed glare at the girl in white, full of killing intent. \u201cBitch. Who are you? Give me your name! Tell me who is your backer. Do you dare?\u201d\u201cAgain with the \u2018bitch\u2019.\u201d The girl felt a sense of bewilderment spread through her, as her temper flared up straight away.\u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t see you make any threats when those guys competed for the beads earlier.\u201d\u201cIf you want the supreme dan bead, does that mean nobody else can take it? If you bid, then no one is allowed to bid after you? Why did you suddenly become so angry and even started cursing at me?\u201d\u201cDoes this guy think that I am this easy to bully, just because I\u2019m a girl?\u201dEven though she was well-cultured, she couldn\u2019t hold back the flames of anger burning in her heart.\u201cMu Zi-He, those words, are you speaking for the Mu Clan?\u201d Xiu Er spoke with a grim tone.People who knew about her status couldn\u2019t help sigh silently.\u201cHow could the Mu Clan send such a fool here?\u201dMu Zi-He laughed and said, \u201cAre you scared, bitch?! With things as they\u2019re now, what use is there to be scared?\u201dAnother \u2018bitch\u2019. Her expression was as cold as ice, Xiu Er drily said, \u201cFair enough! Since that is the case, even if you, the Mu Clan, wishes to retreat, I won\u2019t let you. I will see you in the martial world. But right now the auction for the supreme dan bead is still ongoing. Whoever bids the highest price gets the item. If you don\u2019t have the money, piss off! I don\u2019t have time to quarrel with the poor!\u201dFollowing that, she glared with her almond shaped eyes and enunciated clearly, \u201cI am from the House of the Chaotic Storm, backed by Master Bai! I am Xiu Of The Heavens! Mu Clan, I await your challenge!\u201d[Editor\u2019s Note: Xiu of the Heavens, \u5929\u4e0a\u4e4b\u79c0, literally refers to someone worthy of being born in the Heavens.]To have been disgraced in such a way, Mu Zi-He had felt his temper rise to maximum. Just as he was about to curse back at the girl, he suddenly heard what she said.When he had finally processed her words, his jaw dropped. He was totally stunned!While his face remained purple, all the anger within him had instantly vanished!The entire auction hall shot him gloating looks, as they took great pleasure in his distress.In their eyes, he was a massive fool! \u2014 \u201cNow, you finally realise who you have just offended, right?\u201dAt this moment, Mu Zi-He could only think of one thing, which was\u2026 \u2018I am fxxked\u2019!\u201cWho\u2026 did I just piss off?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026 did I just do?\u201dMu Zi-He\u2019s mind was buzzing with confusion!He felt a bit dizzy as he stood there blankly, unsure of how to proceed.\u2018The House of the Chaotic Storm\u2019!\u2018Backed by Master Bai\u2019!\u2018Xiu Of The Heavens\u2019!These few words were like a string of bombshells, continuously blowing up in Mu Zi-He\u2019s mind.At a complete loss, he looked around the room blankly with helpless eyes, hoping he could get some help from the people around him. However, everyone, who made eye-contact with him, would immediately turn their eyes away. No one wanted to have anything to do with him!They were avoiding him like he was a poisonous snake!The House of the Chaotic Storm. Across the entire Han-Yang continent, it was the legendary power! Backed by the legendary man! They were gods, who stood high above this simple world, looking down upon all beings.It received complete respect from all countries.The seas bowed deeply, showing utter reverence.In front of them, empires were but mere child\u2019s play.This, is the House of the Chaotic Storm.There was another saying: Even if an ultimate expert would stand up and conquer all lands, demanding everything under the sky to kowtow in front of him. Even he wouldn\u2019t be a match from this world\u2019s true number one.The person the proverb described was Master Bai!And the House of the Chaotic Storm, was backed by no other than Master Bai!No one knew who Master Bai really was.

He wanted to say something, anything, to try and explain himself, but he was stunned to the point of being unable to speak.In the blink of an eye, the flames of rage that had filled his chest turned into complete and utter terror!His body was flooded with sweat that couldn\u2019t stop flowing, immediately thoroughly soaking his clothes. Even after he had intensely cultivated for so many years, having a far better instinct than most, Mu Zi-He somehow didn\u2019t actually notice his perspiration.At that moment, in his mind, there remained only one thought\u2013 If the House of the Chaotic Storm truly decided to take action against the Mu Clan\u2026 Then, only complete annihilation awaited the Mu Clan.In fact, there wasn\u2019t even any need for the House of the Chaotic Storm to directly take action.

I shouldn\u2019t speak your honorable name so unadvisedly. But these few days, the Mu Clan has undergone many tribulations. My father is tired, so he was a bit short-tempered just now. He was muddle-headed and spoke impertinent words\u2026\u201dLady Xiu Er humphed and blandly spoke, \u201cHas the Mu Clan\u2026 not become extinct yet?\u201dShe turned and sat down, without saying another word.The father and son from the Mu Clan were standing there, completely stunned. They felt like the way ahead of them, was filled with endless darkness. Their bodies couldn\u2019t stop trembling, like they were going to collapse at any moment.One of the black-clad men affixed his razor-sharp gaze at Mu Zi-He and spoke clearly, \u201cThe Shadow Blades await your instructions at any time!\u201dAnd then he walked away with vigorous strides.The supreme dan bead in this round of the auction was most certainly won by Xiu Er.But now, people were no longer concerned with who the supreme dan bead belonged to. When Xiu Er revealed her identity, the supreme dan bead was already destined to be hers. If anyone dared to bid again, then he was obviously messing with the House of the Chaotic Storm. Which was equal to courting death.They started to feel sorry for the Mu Clan: \u201cThey really are unlucky. Look at what kind of men they sent for this auction. The youth doesn\u2019t have a calm personality and stumbled several times, bringing disgrace to their clan in front of everybody. The elder is even worse; he not only has a brash personality, but also lacks foresight. He actually made a world-class killing force into an enemy of their clan!\u201d\u201cWhen they return to their clan, the clan elders will probably strip them of their skins, right?\u201d Everyone was gloating in their hearts.Guan Wan-Shan called out \u2018one and a half million\u2019 for the third time before slamming the gavel down with a bang. \u201cSold!\u201dMu Zi-He\u2019s body trembled heavily.This ridiculous price of one and a half million was because he had stubbornly pushed it up.He had not only raised the price and cost Master Bai a lot of money, but he had also badly offended Xiu Of The Heavens!He couldn\u2019t help looking at Guan Wan-Shan. Only now did he understand, that when Guan Wan-Shan had tried to stop him, he was actually looking out for him. What a pity. He had treated this kindness as the viscera of a donkey\u2026[TL: viscera of a donkey \u2013 \u9a74\u809d\u80ba literally means the livers and lungs of donkeys. It means to mistake kindness for malicious intent.]He looked at Guan Wan-Shan with imploring eyes and murmured, \u201cBrother Guan\u2026\u201dGuan Wan-Shan was blank-faced as he waved his hand, \u201cI\u2019m but a servant of the salesroom, a slave of the people who will drop dead at any time. How can I accept a man from the glorious Mu Clan calling me Brother? I am not qualified to bear such a title\u2026\u201dMu Zi-He said bitterly, \u201cBrother Guan, what are you talking about. Just now, I was too impulsive. I apologize to you\u2026 Please allow me to ask Brother Guan to put in some good words for me\u2026\u201dSince Mu Zi-He had thoroughly lost his face in front of the entire audience, being humble was his best option. He was grasping for a last straw \u2014 Guan Wan-Shan, who stood before him, was truly the last chance he had to save his life now.Mu Zi-He hadn\u2019t even finished his sentence when Xiu Er spoke up coldly, \u201cWhy is this auction not continuing? What are you waiting for? Don\u2019t you want to keep running the Ling-Bao Hall Salesroom anymore?!\u201dGuan Wan-Shan shut his mouth immediately, not daring to utter another word.Apparently, Xiu Of The Heavens was rather angry\u2026Under these circumstances, who would dare to extend a hand towards Mu Zi-He? To offer any kind of help would be seen as a direct challenge against the House of the Chaotic Storm. No sensible man, who valued his life, would do something as foolish as that!When Mu Zi-He looked around at the audience again, they all turned their heads and averted their gazes. They didn\u2019t even dare to make eye contact with him. They were treating him like he carried a fatal plague\u2026After looking around him, Mu Zi-He completely gave in to his despair.He stood there in a daze, looking like he had aged several years.His son walked over quietly and whispered, \u201cFather?\u201dOnly then did Mu Zi-He sober up as he sighed sadly. He waved his hand feebly and said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to say anymore\u2026\u201dHe stood up shakily and staggered out of the salesroom. The Mu Zi-He at that moment was akin to a walking corpse.His son quietly followed behind him.No one stopped them; no one said goodbye to them, not even the staff of the salesroom.Everyone knew, that since they had offended Xiu Of The Heavens, they should leave as soon as they could. Otherwise, once the auction ended, even that opportunity would be lost to them.People watched the two men walk out. It was like they were looking at two dead bodies, filled with the smell of death.Xiu Er looked at the backs of them and sneered. She then paid no more attention to them.People all understood: If Xiu Of The Heavens wants you dead, even if you ran to the edge of the world, it would still not be a difficult thing for her to get you! Let alone a group as huge as the Mu Clan; it was impossible for them to hide well.\u201cThe fifth supreme dan bead\u2026\u201dGuan Wan-Shan\u2019s voice sounded again and it drew everyone\u2019s attention back to the stage.But then\u2013\u201cOne million!\u201d Xiu Er\u2019s clear voice sounded out. There was no sign of emotion in her voice.People all stayed silent; no one dared to snatch it.Guan Wan-Shan sighed slightly, \u201cSold!\u201dBANG!The gavel descended. He didn\u2019t even count to three.Everyone gave a sigh of relief.\u201cThe sixth supreme dan bead\u2026\u201d\u201cOne million!\u201d Xiu Er bid again.The crowd suddenly erupted into a small commotion.It seemed a little bit excessive that Lady Xiu Er would bid once again.\u201cDamn! We know you\u2019re in a bad mood. It\u2019s fine that we give in for you once. But don\u2019t you know when to stop? Do you want to snatch all the supreme dan beads? The House of the Chaotic Storm is mysterious and powerful, but you can\u2019t suppress us all!\u201dXiu Er stood up and said peacefully, \u201cPlease forgive me. I allowed myself to get upset at two nobodies just now; it has nothing to do with all of you. However, I am under strict orders from my master to secure three dan beads during this auction. Since I have been tasked to do so, I have to bid. I appreciate it if you can do me this favor. I promise that your patience will be rewarded another day.\u201dAfter Xiu Er\u2019s explanation, people instantly felt more comfortable, as the atmosphere in the room calmed down. Someone even replied amiably, \u201cWhat are you talking about, Lady Xiu Er. If Master Bai has given you orders, of course you can get as many as you wish. Even if I won a bead, I would send it to Master Bai myself\u2026\u201dPeople were all going along with his words, but in their minds, they were all cursing at that guy. How could he be so shameless?But at the same time, everyone had the same feeling of regret: \u201cWhy wasn\u2019t I the first one to stand up and say that? It was a convenient path to build a good relationship with Master Bai. What does it matter if it was shameless; why wasn\u2019t I more shameless\u2026\u201dNo one knew that Ye Xiao was gnashing his teeth with hatred.He could clearly sense that Xiu Er wasn\u2019t really angry with what had just happened, or rather, the Mu Clan was simply not significant enough to concern her. However, she used that facade of fury to snatch two supreme dan beads.She had spent the lowest price to get the supreme dan beads. And then, she had used such gentle words to appease the audience, and relax the atmosphere once again. This kind of calculative scheming, it was truly startling.What annoyed Ye Xiao even more, was that, despite the displeasure in his heart, he couldn\u2019t do anything about it.She paid for the dan beads after all, and the price was fair\u2026As he thought about that, he became even more cautious of her: \u201cShe has such a status, even though she\u2019s but a mere maid. Just who is this Master Bai? And\u2026 This House of the Chaotic Storm, what kind of place is it? How can it frighten everyone to this extent?\u201dAfter that, from the seventh supreme dan bead onwards, the competition got fiercer and fiercer. In fact, the scale of the battle could even be described as horrifying!Everybody understood clearly that six of the ten supreme dan beads were already gone!The four that remained were targeted by dozens of groups. They would never give up, as long as they still had a penny to spend!The final price of the seventh dan bead reached one million and 450 thousand!For the eighth dan bead, the price beat the previous highest price, one and a half million, and reached one million and 600 thousand!Even crazier was the price of the ninth dan bead which reached one million and 750 thousand!Ye Xiao\u2019s anger had finally been relieved; he was smiling and gleefully laughing. He seemed to see a huge amount of money flowing into his wallet, as endless as the Chang-Jiang River\u2026\u201cThe last supreme dan bead!\u201dGuan Wan-Shan turned excitedly and shouted, \u201cThis is the last supreme dan bead of this auction! The starting price is the same, as are the bidding rules\u2026\u201dHe hadn\u2019t finished when the first offer was given, \u201cOne million and 750 thousand!\u201dThe next moment, several people shouted at the same time.\u201cOne million and 800 thousand!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cOne million and 850 thousand!\u201d\u201cTwo million!\u201dWhen the record-breaking price of two million came out, the crowd turned silent for a short while. And then suddenly a faint voice was heard, \u201cTwo million and 250 thousand\u2026\u201dThe prime dan-maker of the Ling-Yun Sect, Shi Yue, sat restlessly. In the end, the way he looked at Xiao Mo-Yan was akin to begging!\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, the Pei-Yuan Dan with dan clouds could actually make people go crazy. As for now, the price had already reached an unbelievable number of 2 million and 250 thousand; and that was just for a single dan bead!Even a top-grade dan bead wouldn\u2019t be worth such a high price!However, this dan bead could give rise to unimaginable future achievements for any dan-maker.It even concerned the future of a sect!The competitors who were still bidding for the last supreme dan bead, were all comparable to the Ling-Yun Sect. Even though there were differences among them, it wasn\u2019t a huge gap. If this dan bead was snatched by any of the other sects and they managed to gain something valuable from it, the Ling-Yun Sect could very well be surpassed in the future.That would be a devastating result for the Ling-Yun Sect. Xiao Mo-Yan had to consider it.He thought for a while, before he turned his head to look at balcony No.17.\u201cThe problem now is this Feng Zhi-Ling\u2026 Can he take out any more of these supreme dan beads?Were these supreme dan beads made by himself\u2026 or did he just stumble upon them by coincidence?\u201d\u201cPatriarch\u2026 We can\u2019t take any risks on this\u2026\u201d Shi Yue was burning with anxiety.Xiao Mo-Yan eventually sighed and spoke with a deep voice, \u201c3 million and 150 thousand!\u201dThat was over half of the sect\u2019s available funds. If he couldn\u2019t win the supreme dan bead with this price, he could only give up.If he used any more of the sect\u2019s money and an accident happened, the daily operations of the sect would be badly affected.Xiao Mo-Yan secretly made a decision in mind: \u201cThe more money we have in this mortal world, the better\u2026\u201dWhen people heard the unreasonably high price of 3 million and 150 thousand, they couldn\u2019t believe their ears.\u201cOnly one dan bead!\u201d\u201cThree million and 150 thousand!\u201d\u201cThis is totally insane!\u201dMany people lowered their heads in disappointment. It was possible to run out of strength sometimes and the same could also be applied to wealth.The sects, who were still competing for the last dan bead, saw Xiao Mo-Yan stand up and raise the price of 2 million and 250 thousand by 900 thousand. Once this stage was reached, they could only give up.They all knew, that if any of them bid again, they would be offending the Ling-Yun Sect in public \u2013 even challenging it!That was like kicking a huge hornet\u2019s nest. Nobody could afford to mess with them.\u201cLunatics like Mu Zi-He\u2026 Really are rare in this world after all.\u201d Meng Wu-Fei smiled bitterly and sighed.As the Qing-Yun Sect was the major competitor of the Ling-Yun Sect, it signaled the end of the auction as soon as Meng Wu-Fei quit.The drastic bidding had finally come to an end. At this point, when everyone tried to contact Feng Zhi-Ling, they realised that this mysterious man had already left.He had already left, leaving absolutely no traces behind.The girl in cyan \u2013 Wen-Ren, the girl in white \u2013 Xiu-Er and Xiao Mo-Yan, were all surprised.\u201cThis guy has been maintaining a high-profile, acting as if other people didn\u2019t even exist, like he was the only one who mattered. Why did he disappear so quickly?\u201d\u2026Ye Xiao was sitting comfortably in the private VIP reception room, while drinking a fragrant tea.The auction has concluded. Now, it was time for him to get the cut he deserved.\u201cI\u2019m interested to see, just what kind of trouble the Mu Clan could possibly make for me this time. Humph\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao was thinking, \u201cThey must be busy dealing with their own problems right now.\u201d\u201cAnyway, this House of the Chaotic Storm sounds really powerful\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao frowned, \u201cThe other night, they had put in a lot of effort to frame me. They seem to have been plotting against me so far\u2026\u201dWhile he was thinking about what to do next, Guan Wan-Shan walked in with an accountant.They felt like they were seeing a plutus [Editor note: God of wealth] when they saw Ye Xiao. They nearly bowed in worship!The ten Pei-Yuan Dan beads from Ye Xiao had actually brought them a revenue totaling 15 million and 300 thousand!This much money couldn\u2019t even be described by simple phrases like \u2018turning a stone into gold by touching it\u2019 or \u2018a pie falling from the sky\u2019!It was actually equivalent to a mountain of gold falling from the sky!\u201cBrother Feng\u2026\u201d Guan Wan-Shan ran to Ye Xiao fervently and shook his hands, \u201cNever has an auction in my lifetime created such a profit. It has also created a miracle in this land! 15 million! 15 MILLION!\u201dYe Xiao watched him with a faint smile and said, \u201cUh-huh?\u201dHe drew back his hands from Guan Wan-Shan and said blandly, \u201cIs it really that much?\u201dGuan Wan-Shan was rubbing his hands and said, \u201cYes. Yes. Absolutely. This time, we\u2019ll take 20 percent of it as our profit, according to the agreement. However, there will still be 12 million left for you, Brother Feng!\u201dYe Xiao nodded with a faint smile, \u201cUh-huh? 12 million. That is a lot.\u201dGuan Wan-Shan noticed that something felt off, so he cautiously asked, \u201cBrother Feng, is there anything you aren\u2019t satisfied with?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d Ye Xiao smiled blandly and said, \u201cMaster Guan, those things that I got in the auction, please send them to me. As for the money\u2026 Hehe. Just deduct it from my cut.\u201dGuan Wan-Shan repeatedly promised, \u201cYes. Yes. No problem.\u201dAlthough Ye Xiao had taken a lot of items in the auction, the money which he had spent had only amounted to 2 million and 500 thousand.Under normal circumstances, this would have been an enormous amount of money.However, compared to the 12 million he was going to get, it was not a huge amount.By now, the experienced Guan Wan-Shan had noticed that something was definitely wrong.\u201cMaster Feng\u2019s smile looks\u2026 Complex somehow\u2026 No, it\u2019s weird\u2026Ordinary people would definitely faint from excitement when getting such a large amount of money. Why is he acting so nonchalantly?\u201dGuan Wan-Shan couldn\u2019t understand it.Ye Xiao remained ambivalent . He didn\u2019t say anything, but only urged them to complete the remaining tasks. Guan Wan-Shan felt confused, but he could only murmur in confusion while wrapping up the formalities, wondering what could be wrong.Ye Xiao kept a rigid and faint smile on his face, while he sat cross-legged, as he was watching the accountant.The abacus was making a noise.Guan Wan-Shan was really tense and his mind was running at full speed.\u201cWhat on earth\u2026 made this guy unhappy?\u201dThat was not a middling issue, the guy was truly their plutus. If they couldn\u2019t satisfy him, it would definitely be a huge loss for the salesroom!\u201cAll right. After deducting the cost of the purchased items, Master Feng\u2019s earnings will amount to 7 million and 550 thousand.\u201d The accountant finally finished counting while drops of sweat were rolling down his forehead, \u201cAs for the tax that should be paid to the treasury, we will cover it. That\u2019s an order from Master Guan.\u201d\u201cNo need. There\u2019s no need to bother the salesroom with such a small amount of money.\u201d Ye Xiao spoke in an odd tone, \u201cI have so much money, that it really isn\u2019t an issue. Besides, the supreme dan beads are nothing special to me anyway\u2026 I don\u2019t think you should be the one who pays that tax. You\u2019ve worked hard for this auction and only earned a little.\u201d\u201cThe supreme dan beads!\u201dGuan Wan-Shan was enlightened. He finally realised what it was that displeased Master Feng.\u201cI see.I guess what makes this guy unhappy, is that\u2026 The ten supreme dan beads were sold for 15 million and it\u2019s really a huge price, but he only got 500 thousand for the five that were sold to the salesroom.According to the average price in the auction, those five dan beads could be sold for at least 7 million and 500 thousand silver bars.500 thousand, when compared to 7 million and 500 thousand, was absolutely nothing!That\u2019s a huge loss that one could even figure it out with his toes.It\u2019d be weird if this guy felt happy about it.\u201dHowever, the problem now, was that the price of the five dan beads were previously agreed upon. And at the end of the day, business was business. Ye Xiao couldn\u2019t say anything about it, let alone go back on his word.However, it didn\u2019t mean that the Xiao Monarch would be happy with a loss of over 7 million!And to make things worse, it was given to the man who made money off of him.The Ling-Bao Hall Salesroom was not doing this auction for free; they got 20 percent of the total sales price. That amounted to almost 3 million!\u201cHold on. Stop for a second.\u201dAlthough Guan Wan-Shan had finally realised the problem, it wasn\u2019t something he could solve with his authority.Guan Wan-Shan understood one other thing: If they failed to satisfy this Master Feng\u2026 He would definitely say nothing about it, but he wouldn\u2019t come back to the Ling-Bao Hall when he got anything valuable in the future!He might\u2019ve earned a lot this time \u2013 it was of course, no loss, but he didn\u2019t feel satisfied; it wasn\u2019t enough.Time passed. Ye Xiao had already finished two pots of tea by the time Guan Wan-Shan returned, wiping sweat from his forehead. He walked over to Ye Xiao and smiled, \u201cYou see, Brother Feng, I just asked our boss for instructions\u2026 and we\u2019ve come to a decision\u2026\u201dYe Xiao replied blandly, \u201cReally? What decision?\u201d\u201cYes. Since we bought five of the supreme dan beads from you the other day for a really low price, we have taken advantage of you after all. Brother Feng is a generous gentleman and hasn\u2019t voiced his displeasure about this, but we can\u2019t just accept such kindness for nothing.\u201d Guan Wan-Shan looked at Ye Xiao\u2019s face while he was speaking.\u201cHmmm\u2026\u2026..\u201d Ye Xiao drawled.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHow about this\u2026 those items that you won in the auction, we\u2019ll give them to you as gifts. We won\u2019t charge anything for them. They are just some small things. Please don\u2019t refuse.\u201d Guan Wan-Shan said.Ye Xiao was thinking: \u201cThat was well said. You give me things worth approximately 3 million and actually called them small gifts. And you actually asked me not to refuse\u2026 You really are speaking louder than others because of wealth.\u201dA joyful expression was covering his face, however, his mouth was saying hesitantly, \u201cWell that\u2026 That isn\u2019t appropriate. It was an agreement which had been made in advance.

Look at your mouth. The grin on your face has reached your ears and you actually said that it was improper and that you couldn\u2019t accept?Is there even a single damn thing that you\u2019d feel embarrassed for?\u201dBut on the surface, Guan Wan-Shan was acting fervidly, \u201cNo No No. Please. We\u2019re pleased that you don\u2019t dislike them.\u201d\u201cOf course I like them. Even if you give small gifts like these ten times a day, I will never dislike any of them!\u201dYe Xiao answered in his mind, but the expression on his face implied \u2018it\u2019s impolite to refuse, but shameful to accept\u2019. He rubbed his hands and said with a smile, \u201cYou deserve those dan beads, but now you\u2019re\u2026 Gosh. I am really\u2026 Hahahaha\u2026 You\u2019re so generous and so enthusiastic. Master Guan, you and me, we\u2019re friends!\u201dHe tapped Guan Wan-Shan\u2019s shoulder while he was talking with an enthusiastic look.Guan Wan-Shan\u2019s cheek muscle couldn\u2019t help but twitch\u2026\u201cI knew it. I understand you\u2026 If I don\u2019t give up and give this money to you, you\u2019d definitely not make friends with me\u2026\u201dYe Xiao left the salesroom, laden with bags filled with treasures, in front of the staff of the salesroom. He left through the back door and got on the private sedan-chair owned by the salesroom, heading back home with his fruitful results.It wasn\u2019t exaggerated to say \u2018fruitful results\u2019. He had obtained about seven medical materials, one piece of the Cosmic Hades, and a bag of Sky Crystal Sand; this was quite the harvest!As for the notes of silver and gold, they were actually kind of a burden to Ye Xiao.The sphere\u2019s space wasn\u2019t able to absorb these notes.When the amount of money one possessed had expanded beyond a certain amount, it really had the ability to smother them to death. Even though they were just very thin notes, it was still frightening when there were too many of them.Therefore, Ye Xiao only took 500 notes, which were all worth the maximum value of 5 thousand silver bars. As for the rest of the money, he decided to leave it in the salesroom for the time being.Of course, Guan Wan-Shan consented at once to the request of Ye Xiao. In fact he felt happy about it: \u201cNow that you\u2019ve left such a large amount of money in the salesroom, how could you possibly abandon us?\u201dThe sedan-chair had travelled for a long distance when the two carriers suddenly realised something was wrong.What could be wrong?The sedan-chair was too light!There is a huge difference between an empty sedan-chair and an occupied sedan-chair!They stopped the sedan-chair and looked inside. Only to find the man who had been sitting inside the sedan-chair to have already disappeared. The two carriers looked at each other and nearly thought that they had seen a ghost.\u2026Ye Xiao took the notes, which were worth a huge amount of money, with him and walked through the streets like his sleeves were filled with gold. He was overcome with joy, not only because he had earned his first giant pot of gold in this second life, but also because the medical materials that he got in the auction had surprised him. He had thought that no more than two of them could be absorbed into the space, but in fact, four of the seven materials were absorbed and had taken root.As for the other three, they were naturally drained and thrown away like dried turnips by Ye Xiao. Ye Xiao was quite proficient in this process; as a matter of fact, he was extremely skilled with it.In fact, there was another thing that had surprised him. The Sky Crystal Sand had also been entirely absorbed by the space. Although he didn\u2019t know what it was used for at the moment, he was sure that the sand was valuable as it had been accepted by the space.The Cosmic Hades, which had been re-auctioned many times before, had been waiting for its rightful owner, and it had finally met him this time \u2013 or more specifically, the right \u2018space\u2019, because it was automatically absorbed by the space, just like the Pure Heavenly Crystal!It was equal in strength to the Pure Heavenly Crystal.No. The Cosmic Hades was even more powerful than the Pure Heavenly Crystal \u2013 a lot more.After the Cosmic Hades entered the space, it kept producing the gelid qi as usual. The Pure Heavenly Crystal was also producing scorching qi at the same time.These two energies, with opposing attributes, were actually blending.However, the energy from the Pure Heavenly Crystal was obviously weaker than the other. The only way it was coping with the gelid qi was through combining with the energy that originated from the other consumed medicines. But even with the help of the other medical materials, it couldn\u2019t fully withstand the gelid qi.Therefore, the temperature of the space decreased gradually\u2026The whole space seemed to come to a standstill, except for the transforming energies.The energy of the medical materials kept flowing under the egg and most of it had even been absorbed by the egg. On the jade plate at the end of the tunnel, there appeared several new dan beads.Ye Xiao walked over and had a closer look at it.He was instantly overjoyed!The dan beads that had shown up this time were also top-quality supreme dan beads with dan clouds. Among the ten supreme dan beads, there were eight Pei-Yuan Dan; the other two were purple dan beads with a shiny metallic lustre.Bone Ablutionary Dan!It was one level higher than the Pei-Yuan Dan!As an expert of cultivation, Ye Xiao recognized it with a single glance.Bone Ablutionary Dan was literally used for ablution of muscles and bones to expel the filth of the body.Cultivators who were lucky enough to use it could have a brighter future.A \u2019brighter future\u2019 wasn\u2019t just a saying. A cultivator who used 10 Bone Ablutionary Dan beads could steeply increase the quality of their Jing and Mai. No matter what kind of martial arts he cultivated in afterwards, he could get twice the result with half the effort. How could this not be a brighter future?Therefore, the Bone Ablutionary Dan was what a cultivator, who hadn\u2019t built his foundation yet, most wanted and most needed.The Bone Ablutionary Dan was quite normal in the Qing-Yun Realm, but since the Land of Han-Yang was a rather low-level realm, it was an extremely valuable dan. Even the major sects didn\u2019t have many. Basically, only the disciples who were the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me, could have a chance to use it.Ordinary disciples would never stand a chance to touch it, much less use it.\u201cMy sphere has started to produce the Bone Ablutionary Dan\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao was pleased with these qualitative improvements.And then he started to pay attention to the weird egg.The way it absorbed the energies was really horrible.Ye Xiao frowned and stared at the egg for a while and he had finally found something new. It seemed that more mysterious veins had appeared on the egg. The size of the egg had also gotten larger. However, Ye Xiao suspected that he was seeing an illusion\u2026If it wasn\u2019t an illusion, then why is it that the color of the egg seemed brighter than before?!There were no other changes, except for those mentioned above. It still had no traces of life.Ye Xiao looked at the egg, and then gnashed his teeth in hatred\u2026 \u201cWicked egg. When will you hatch? How many more cultivation resources do you need to absorb\u2026\u201dHe then turned to the side, where the planting was going on and all the gloom in his chest had instantly vanished.In the middle of the planting area, the Heaven\u2019s Cyan was already tall and straight. It was as thick as a bowl and had already reached 16 meters in height. Its crown was almost 10 meters wide!Every soft green leaf was like a flashing light.The green was even more delicate than one could imagine.It was no longer a Heaven\u2019s Cyan; it had become an early stage Tree of Cultivating Tea!Naturally, Ye Xiao was smiling from ear to ear.The four medical materials he had just gained had rooted themselves in the north, south, east and west corners of this area. He could clearly feel that they were much more animated now that they were inside the sphere.Ye Xiao did some maths and was shocked by the outcome!When he had first acquired the Heaven\u2019s Cyan, it was already over nine thousand years old. However, it still needed hundreds of years to upgrade into the Tree of Cultivating Tea. But how long was it since it first entered the sphere\u2019s space?Five or six days?!It had actually already become a Tree of Cultivating Tea? And since it was already in the early stages; it had even completely skipped the baby stage.So, how much faster was the growth rate inside\u2026 compared to outside?This question wasn\u2019t easy to answer. It required scientific research. Regardless, it was definitely a lot faster!While Ye Xiao was overjoyed and thinking about the fast growth rate of the medical materials in the space, he clearly felt the space quiver. It brought a horrible feeling, like this place was about to collapse.The horrible pressures came from all directions.The pressure was crazily pushing towards the center of the space!Ye Xiao didn\u2019t even have the time to react, before he felt himself ejected from the space.This was not the first time that he had been ejected from the space, but this time, the feeling was countless of times stronger than before!He totally lost control, like he was dangling inside the furious billows of the ocean. He felt nauseous and dizzy; he felt as if the world was spinning and he couldn\u2019t do a single thing to help himself!\u201cWhat the\u2026 What\u2019s going on?\u201d Ye Xiao closed his eyes to try and relieve the feeling of nausea, but failed. He then tried to move to a nearby street corner to find something to lean on, but he couldn\u2019t. He had to crouch down and put his hands on the ground, like he was crawling.Such an afflictive feeling was something that he had never been through before \u2013 not in his previous life, nor in his second!His thoughts were flying about in his head. He could clearly feel that his spiritual power was being absorbed. He had fallen into an idiot-like condition, as he turned completely muddle headed\u2026When his spiritual power was drained completely, Ye Xiao could no longer hold on; he collapsed on the ground and passed out.Before he passed out, he only had one thought in mind: \u201cFor goodness\u2019 sake, don\u2019t be seen by others. I am still Feng Zhi-Ling at the moment\u2026\u201d\u2026However, things always went contrary to one\u2019s wishes.Right after Ye Xiao passed out, several people were walking toward him slowly.The one walking in front was the girl in cyan. Behind her, there were two other persons \u2013 one was a middle-aged man while the other was a middle-aged woman.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cMy lady, shall we just go back\u2026 or shall we\u2026?\u201d The middle-aged woman stopped talking, as she frowned.The girl in cyan had her face covered with silk. That\u2019s right. She was the girl in cyan who had been bidding for the Regeneration Ink Lotus against Ye Xiao at the auction.\u2026Editor note: Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying this novel! We\u2019ve got a small question and we\u2019d like your input! In this chapter the space in the sphere in his head has been mentioned quite a number of times and we\u2019re not sure how to name it. Should we start the chapter with referring to it as the sphere\u2019s space and then just call it space, should we call it the sphere\u2019s space all the time, or just call it space all the time?

We came to the Kingdom of Chen to study the local customs and to observe the political scenario of this country. Of course, the most important thing is to see how the battle between the princes progresses.\u201d\u201cThat is what we are here for.\u201d\u201cWe are from the Kingdom of Lan-Feng. If we want to become the supremacy in this land, we need to be concerned about these important aspects.\u201dThe girl in cyan spoke blandly and turned around the corner.As she rounded the corner, an \u2018oh\u2019 sound leaked out from her mouth out of surprise. The three of them had run into the unconscious body of Ye Xiao.\u201cThis guy\u2026\u201d The girl in cyan\u2019s expression changed and a serious glint appeared in her eyes, \u201cThis guy\u2026 Isn\u2019t he the guy from the auction, the owner of the supreme dan beads?\u201dThe middle-aged woman walked over and identified Ye Xiao, \u201cYes. This average-size, strong body and that square jaw. He is definitely that guy named Feng!\u201dThe girl in cyan was agitated. She looked around and spoke anxiously, \u201cHe must have been assaulted\u2026\u201d She then reached her hand out to touch Ye Xiao\u2019s neck and said, \u201cHe is still alive. He is breathing\u2026\u201dShe stood up and immediately started issuing orders, \u201cAunt Hua, go get a carriage. Don\u2019t be discovered. Bring this guy to our house in the Kingdom of Chen. This guy\u2026 If I am right, he will be very useful in the future.\u201dThe middle-aged woman quickly left to find a carriage.Meanwhile, the girl in cyan lifted her foot and kicked Ye Xiao\u2019s body thrice. -Pah Pah Pah!- She had sealed Ye Xiao\u2019s three major acupoints. Now, regardless of whether Ye Xiao wakes up or not, he would be unable to perform any martial arts in the near future.She then reached out her hand and put a dan bead into his mouth before taking a black napkin from her bag and covering his head with it. She said, \u201cMr. Zhao, please carry him on your back. And be careful. Don\u2019t let anyone see his face.\u201d\u201cYes, my lady.\u201d That Mr. Zhao obeyed and bent down before lifting Ye Xiao and placing him on his back.The girl in cyan reached out her hand once again to quickly search Ye Xiao\u2019s body. Leaving her hand inside Ye Xiao\u2019s clothes, she stood there, shocked and confused.She said, \u201cApart from some notes, there is nothing left on him\u2026 It seems that this supreme dan bead owner was robbed\u2026 In spite of carrying a bunch of precious items, he still flaunted his wealth, so it is reasonable that someone would rob him. But why didn\u2019t the ones who robbed him take these notes which are worth a small fortune? Do they not like money\u2026 Why?!\u201d\u201cOr maybe\u2026 are the robbers not from the mortal world?\u201d\u201cIf so, who could it be?\u201d\u201cCould there be an unknown force behind this?\u201d\u201cThis is really surprising and beyond comprehension\u2026\u201dAs she was collecting her thoughts, she felt her palm heat up. She realized that it was the heat coming from Ye Xiao\u2019s body.The girl in cyan suddenly drew her hand back like she had suddenly received an electric shock. Her face was veiled and hence, her expression could not be seen; but her neck had visibly turned red.Realizing what she did, she cursed herself: \u201cWhat is wrong with me? Why was I so absent-minded? I actually kept my hand inside a man\u2019s clothes for such a long time\u2026\u201dWhile she was lost in thought, she realized, \u201cHmmm. This guys smell is not the kind that I dislike. It smells like a purified body, which has divorced the filth of the mortal world\u2026\u201d\u201cSince he has a purified body, he must be a supreme cultivator\u2026 So the one who robbed him must be at a much higher level to take this guy down without leaving a single mark on his body\u2026\u201d\u201cTherefore, the robber must at least have the strength of level six of the Grade of Diyuan\u2026 To find out an accurate estimate, we will have to wait for this guy to wake up and then confirm his cultivation level\u2026\u201dBy now, Mr. Zhao had walked out of the alley carrying Ye Xiao, whose head was still covered by the black napkin.Not far from them, a carriage came into sight.The middle-aged woman was walking besides the carriage.The girl in cyan grabbed Ye Xiao and got in the carriage without any hesitation and the middle-aged woman followed her in after her.Mr. Zhao didn\u2019t follow after them. Instead, he threw a piece of gold to the coachman and said, \u201cI will take the carriage.\u201dHe jumped on the coach without saying another word and picked up the whip. He yelled and lashed the horse and the carriage steadily moved ahead .He sat on the front, dangling his legs with a dim light in his eyes. He looked exactly like a coachman with years of experience driving a carriage.He could truly look like a dragon or a tiger if he wanted to be one.Such skill was truly amazing.Even when the carriage had gone far away, the coachman had still remained standing on that spot with a dreamy look on his face.\u201cIs there really someone who wishes to exchange an old carriage for a big piece of shiny gold? This piece of gold must be worth at least thirty carriages like mine! I really have made my fortune today. Pies are falling from the sky today!\u201dThe coachman finally awoke from his stupor once the carriage went out of his sight. He put the gold into his pocket joyfully and headed home.\u201cRight. I should go buy another carriage. There is still a lot more I can do with this money. I can buy some new clothes for my wife. It is so sad that she has been with me for so many years and has never experienced any good days\u2026 I can also buy some decent food for my son and daughter. Oh, and new clothes for each of them. Oh, it is time to let the kids go to school\u2026The rest of the money, I shall not use it rashly. And I need to earn more money as soon as possible\u2026 I should give the kids bright futures, not like mine \u2013 working as a coachman\u2026\u201dHe had seen a wonderful vision in his mind while he was thinking about it\u2026 He just couldn\u2019t help smiling\u2026\u2026Ye Xiao\u2019s body was twitching. Although he was unconscious at the moment, his body still twitched. It seemed like his Jing and Mai would explode at any moment\u2026His mind and his spiritual consciousness seemed to explode. His entire body was experiencing an excruciating pain.His face showed a frown but his mouth remained tightly shut and he made no sounds at all.The girl in cyan laid him on the seat in the carriage and saw his Jing and Mai sticking out and sinking back, weirdly pulsating. It looked like earthworms were wriggling within his body. She knew that he was suffering from an unimaginable amount of pain every passing moment. She couldn\u2019t help but sigh.\u201cWhat malicious thing did the robber do to him? Such an inhumane method\u2026 He has been unconscious for such a long time and the pain is still bothering him\u2026 I have tried several methods, but I still can\u2019t find any solution for this\u2026 And I can\u2019t find any clue about such a technique.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of martial arts could make people suffer like this?\u201d\u201cThe robber is really unscrupulous. He not only robbed him, but also attacked him in such a vicious fashion. It would be better to just kill him now than make him go through such horrible pain. It really makes people bristle with anger!\u201d The middle-aged woman was also filled with indignation.They had seen a lot of murders and they too had a lot of blood on their hands.However, it was the first time in their lives that they had witnessed such a malicious technique.It was apparently making him beg for death\u2026What kind of deep hatred could drive people to do such a malicious thing!\u201cHowever, no wonder this guy is the owner of the supreme dan. He really has some tough bones.\u201d The girl in cyan smiled and said, \u201cForget ordinary people, even an expert cultivator, when suffering from such extreme pain while unconscious, would at least scream out in agony. But this guy has never made a single sound. That is especially commendable.\u201dThere was a sense of appreciation in her tone. She sighed, \u201cA man with such will\u2026 Is there anything in the world he can\u2019t accomplish? He wouldn\u2019t have been able to make the legendary supreme dan beads if he didn\u2019t have such strong will. I believe, now more than ever, that the supreme dan of the auction is from this guy!\u201dThe carriage was moving steadily along the road. They were nearing the southern gate of Chen-Xing City. After a tiring journey, they arrived at the gate of a big house and the carriage finally stopped.Mr. Zhao made a gesture causing the door to open. \u2013 \u2018Tik Tak Tik Tak\u2019 -The entire carriage passed through the door.The door was closed again immediately.\u2026Ye Xiao was still insensible to the changing environment. He felt like he was drifting on the choppy sea and the rogue waves were hitting him one after another. He could have sunk and died at any moment.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euYe Xiao knew that he could do nothing more but hold onto his sense of self with all his effort. He gnashed his teeth and endured the pain to the best of his capabilities. He ignored everything that was happening outside of his subconsciousness.He didn\u2019t even know that he had already been captured by someone else like a meat on the chopping block.When the strong quivering was finally over, Ye Xiao\u2019s body had undergone over 70 bouts of intense sweating. If not for the girl in cyan taking care of him because of his status as \u2018owner of the supreme dan\u2019, he would have become a skeleton due to dehydration. That was no joking matter!It was to say, that the girl in cyan had unwittingly become the savior of the mythical supreme cultivator \u2013 the Xiao Monarch!Of course, neither the savior nor the one who was saved had any idea about it yet!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 50 \u2013 The Nine SpacesWhen Ye Xiao had completely recovered, the first thing he did was to get back into his mind and check out the Space in order to find out what had happened!The day when he had been forcibly ejected from the Space, he had truly felt that the Space was about to be destroyed. The worst possible outcome now would be if the Space really collapsed. That would\u2019ve been an absolutely fatal strike for Ye Xiao!At this moment, he truly didn\u2019t care about his whereabouts: He was simply glad to be alive!He entered the Space and was instantly stunned with what he saw!\u201cIs this\u2026 Is this the Space which I had known?\u201dIt was not destruction which had taken place; it was reconstruction!Well, it might be a bit too much to describe it as reconstruction. There weren\u2019t many changes in the minor details. However, the entire place had been separated into nine parts!The egg was placed at the core of the space!The front, the back, the left, the right, the top\u2026 The nine parts were located in nine different locations and each of them could be identified with nine different colors: Nine different spaces!The first space was on top with the Cosmic Hades inside, continually emitting the blue gelid qi. This space was obviously not filled \u2013 not even one percent of it had been occupied.There was an ivory space below which contained the Pure Heavenly Crystal. Likewise, it was barely filled.There was a space on the left containing precious plants. The plants were producing a cyan coloured-qi. Naturally, it was also far from being completely filled\u2026There was another space containing the Sky Crystal Sand. It was quite empty at the moment, but it was certainly not as empty as the remaining five spaces, because the other five spaces were completely barren.\u2018The world of nine elements\u2019!These words unexpectedly popped up in Ye Xiao\u2019s mind as he looked around the nine spaces.Within each space, distinct words could be found hovering in the air.\u2018Sky Space\u2019\u2018Earth Space\u2019\u2018Gold Space\u2019\u2018Wood Space\u2019\u2018Flame Space\u2019\u2018Water Space\u2019\u2019Soul Space\u2019\u2018Yang Space\u2019\u2018Yin Space\u2019The nine Spaces!The Cosmic Hades was in the Sky Space; the Pure Heavenly Crystal was in the Soul Space; the Tree of Cultivating Tea and the other plants were in the Wood Space; the Sky Crystal Sand was in the Gold Space!The rest were all empty. Apparently, Ye Xiao was yet to collect anything that had attributes corresponding to those Spaces.The next moment, sixteen words appeared from the void and spun extremely fast, flying past Ye Xiao\u2019s eyes. They turned into purple clouds and then into purple qi before finally entering into the Space.To assemble the nine elements; to reverse the world. The nine return to their origin; the Ruler of the Firmament!He didn\u2019t need any explanation. Ye Xiao knew exactly what it meant.To fully utilise the Space, Ye Xiao needed to collect all the nine kinds of qi. Only then could he open and enter the gate which led to ultimate strength.If he completely filled the nine spaces with the nine different types of elemental qi, he would become the Ruler of the Firmament!Looking at the items in the Space, he felt like they were just a drop in the ocean. Ye Xiao felt like weeping, but had no tears, \u201cThis is Space is going to play me till death. Where the hell can I acquire this amount of treasures? I am afraid that even filling the Space with the entire Qing-Yun Realm may not be enough to make \u2018the nine return to their origin\u2019\u2026\u201dMeanwhile, he heard faint voices from his surroundings.Ye Xiao felt like crying and drew back his mind from the Space\u2026 \u201cThat is quite a strike. So many Spaces and every one of them is massive\u2026 What am I going to do with them. How long will it take for me to fill it?\u201dAnd then he heard a voice of a girl sounding outside, \u201cHe must have made it through the pain successfully\u2026 This guy is really tough. For a whole day\u2026 he hasn\u2019t been broken down\u2026 He actually got through it\u2026\u201d\u201cSuch power of will is truly worth admiring\u2026\u201d\u201cI wonder who on earth did this\u2026\u201d\u201cYes. Such a method is really unscrupulous and cruel\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm. Bring some water and feed him. We can\u2019t let him die. If he really dies of dehydration, that is going to be a big joke.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAnd then he heard a girl stand up and leave to fetch some water.Ye Xiao understood a lot from this short conversation.\u201cFirst of all, I am not in my own house; second, the two women think that I was attacked\u2026 Third, my true status hasn\u2019t been revealed yet; fourth, this girl may have saved me, but she may not have good intentions as my Jing and Mai are blocked\u2026 Therefore, I can only conclude that I am a captive here?\u201dHe felt relieved at the same time. The mutation before was really scary and he was totally defenseless at that time. Let alone martial cultivators, even an ordinary person could have easily killed him. No matter what the girl\u2019s intention was, she had saved his life after all. He would have to repay this debt anyway.He had disguised himself and turned into Feng Zhi-Ling. Now, if he wanted to take off the disguise, he needed to perform his martial arts again.In fact, if no one had paid attention to him or done anything to him while he was in coma, his body would have automatically performed the arts in order to regain his true appearance.If so, his secret and status would have been exposed.However, someone had shown up and blocked his Jing and Mai and this caused his secret disguise to be maintained.Unfortunately, this resulted in the pain that Ye Xiao suffered to become several times stronger. However, compared to his body exploding, his status and secret\u2026It didn\u2019t matter at all.Ye Xiao groaned and woke up \u2018slowly\u2019. He opened his eyes with \u2018difficulty\u2019 and looked around.He saw a girl in cyan walkover and ask him in a soothing tone, \u201cAre you awake?\u201dYe Xiao looked at her and found that his savior was actually the girl who had bid against him for the Regeneration Ink Lotus, so he felt relaxed. He spoke \u2018faintly\u2019, \u201cLady\u2026 It is you\u2026 Where\u2026 Where am I? Did you save me?\u201dThe girl in cyan smiled softly and said, \u201cA simple gesture. Nothing to speak of. Brother Feng, you don\u2019t need to take it to heart.\u201dYe Xiao acted like he was extremely thrilled, he blushed and reached out his hands to hold the hands of the girl in cyan. He said gratefully, \u201cLady\u2026 You saved my life. What you have done is equivalent to giving me a rebirth. I will always remember your kindness\u2026\u201dThings happened so quickly that the girl didn\u2019t have time to react. She didn\u2019t expect a dying patient could reach out his hands so fast. She only felt that her hands had fallen into his warm palms.The pretty hands of hers that had never been touched by any man, were actually held firmly by this guy!A blush immediately appeared on her face and feelings of anger surged in her heart. She wanted to draw her hands back. She spoke with a constrained smile, \u201cBrother Feng, you are too kind. It really means nothing\u2026\u201dYe Xiao kept holding her soft hands and didn\u2019t let go. He spoke with a sigh, \u201cLady, you are kind-hearted and have saved me from danger. And yet you don\u2019t claim the credit. You really have a strong sense of integrity. But I am not the kind of person to treat such kindness with ingratitude, am I?\u201dHe held her hands even more strongly and said, \u201cYou are such a kind person. You are ladylike and soft, brave and gentle. You are noble and you spread joy to the whole world\u2026\u201dThe girl tried to withdraw her hands again, but failed. She was hearing every complimentary word from his mouth. She couldn\u2019t be mad, and she didn\u2019t dare to act too recklessly. She was afraid that she would hurt him again as he had just recovered from a serious condition. If so, her efforts to save him would be in vain\u2026She found it both funny and annoying as she said, \u201cBrother Feng, could you please let go of my hands first? I\u2026 I am not used to\u2026\u201d\u201cOh Oh Oh\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao instantly let go of her hands , \u201cOh. I am being rude\u2026 Sorry. Sorry\u2026\u201dHe rubbed his fingers and he could still feel the lingering presence of her soft hands in his palms. What a wonderful feeling\u2026However, there was something wrong \u2013 seriously wrong.Ye Xiao had obviously felt that this girl was a cultivator, and her strength was powerful. He felt that she was making a showy display of her ability.She had been disguising herself in order to show people that she was weak.In fact, in the Land of Han-Yang, there were not many people that could see through her disguise. However, Ye Xiao could. How could a simple trick like this escape his attention. He had once been the Xiao Monarch who had ruled the Qing-Yun Realm!The sense of her strength was faint, but it was real. Even if she had covered it very well, Ye Xiao could still feel it.Such strength wouldn\u2019t exist if she wasn\u2019t a cultivator who focused on swords.However, Ye Xiao had pretended to be a lecher so as to hold and touch her hands, but he didn\u2019t find any trace of sword play!There wasn\u2019t even any trace of martial arts!That was weird. It was totally against common sense.No matter how much she took care of her skin, or how many times her body was abluted, it wouldn\u2019t change the fact that whoever cultivated with swords, or any martial arts for that matter, would have traces of this martial art on his or her hands. These traces were not noticeable to ordinary people, but they were quite obvious to cultivators, especially to expert cultivators.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBut this girl didn\u2019t have any trace of cultivation at all!At that moment, although he hadn\u2019t touched her hands for long, the girl had asked him to let go, so he had to let go.When Ye Xiao withdrew his hands, he felt embarrassed.He was the Xiao Monarch, not some lecherous guy. After being admonished by a girl, even if he had a thick hide, he couldn\u2019t stop the blush creeping up his neck. He felt really awkward.After all, the hands of a young lady\u2026 were not something a man should casually hold, so he apologized in a low voice, \u201cWell, uh\u2026 Sorry\u2026 that I touched your\u2026 um\u2026 your hands\u2026 for that long\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You had to wonder if he was lacking a brain or that his brain had become totally mushy.So was it playing, teasing, or just bald-faced flirting? \u2014 Of course, Ye Xiao himself didn\u2019t even realize this.The girl in cyan had pretended to be unflappable at the beginning. She had decided to bear with his \u2018hand-holding\u2019 and remain oblivious to it. But now Ye Xiao had brought attention to the situation, making her whole body heat up. Her eyes widened and she felt ashamed as well as resentful. She was about to lash out at him and was glaring at him.No matter if it was intentional or not, what he had just said was too over the top!Ye Xiao knew that things had gone wrong immediately and realized that he had just said something stupid, so he groaned, tilted his head and \u2018passed out\u2019 again\u2026Although his EQ was really low, his IQ was quite high; he clearly knew how to use the current situation to seize the initiative.It wasn\u2019t the decent thing to do, but it worked!The girl in cyan was about to get mad, but she saw him faint again. She knew he was pretending, but she still found it funny in spite of being annoyed!\u201cFine. Fair enough. It can at least clear up the embarrassment at the moment!\u201dShe humphed and stood up, grabbed the bowl of water and shouted angrily, \u201cGet up and drink.\u201dYe Xiao kept pretending to be unconscious to avoid the embarrassment.The girl started to become angry. \u201cYou took advantage of me and now you\u2019re actually playing dead. You can absolutely move now. Do you want me to feed you myself?\u201d\u2013 Splash!- The water was dumped onto his face\u2026The Xiao Monarch was stunned. It looked like he could no longer pretend\u2026\u2026\u201cBrother Feng, who did this to you, who used such a despicable torture method on you?\u201d The girl held a cup of tea in her hand and smiled gently.She had taken off the silk veil that had covered her, revealing an ordinary face.Ye Xiao said faintly, \u201cBefore I start to talk, could you please unblock my Jing and Mai? I could recover faster\u2026\u201dThe girl smiled softly and said, \u201cWhat are you talking about Brother Feng? You are an expert cultivator. If I set you free, it would be like letting the dragon return to the sea and the tiger roar in the jungle. I am an infirm girl. That would be a disaster for me, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201dYe Xiao sighed and said, \u201cYou only need these two guards of yours to flick their fingers to fight against me\u2026 What are you worrying for? There is truly no need!\u201d\u201cWell it is better to be cautious while living in the mortal world. Cautiousness guarantees years of sailing for the ship.\u201d The girl smiled sweetly.No matter how hard Ye Xiao tried to convince her with a flow of eloquence, she wouldn\u2019t unblock his Jing and Mai.\u201cThis girl looks soft and sweet, but she is very stubborn inside. She won\u2019t easily change her mind on what she believes to be right.\u201d Ye Xiao came to a conclusion regarding the girl.\u201cGosh. I really did not engage with women a lot in my former life. I really don\u2019t understand how girls think. She has saved my life. Is it really necessary to take precautions against me like this? Do they think I am some kind of ungrateful rat\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao was upset and depressed.\u201cBrother Feng, you haven\u2019t talked about why you left the auction in a hurry and how you encountered such a thing\u2026\u201d The girl smiled favorably. She casually wiped her hands with a silk handkerchief.It seemed that she still minded the fact that her hands were \u2018touched by a man\u2019.\u201cIt was my bad luck.\u201d Ye Xiao showed emotions on the face and sighed, \u201cAt the auction, I purchased a lot of items and I was going to go back home early for dan-making\u2026 Besides, I had too much money with me, so I didn\u2019t leave with you guys\u2026 I hardly imagined that a masked man dressed in white would appear in front of me when I turned the corner to go into an alley\u2026\u201d\u201cA masked man in white?\u201d The girl in cyan frowned, \u201cIf he was planning to rob you, why did he dress in white? If he was in white, he must not be afraid of exposing himself, but then why did he mask himself? \u2026 That is very odd.\u201d\u201cWho knows. The man in white\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao kept bragging while he was thinking: \u201cThis girl is really scrupulous.\u201d The expression on his face was sincere though, \u201cThe man in white just swung his hand and then a stream of blue light quickly flew into my face\u2026 I couldn\u2019t defend against it. It was too powerful\u2026\u201d\u201cBlue light?\u201d The girl in cyan focused on these words and asked perceptively, \u201cWhat kind of blue light?\u201dYe Xiao was stunned, \u201cUrh? What?\u201dThe girl spoke blandly, \u201cWhat kind of blue was it. Was it an acid blue? Or sky blue? Or sea blue? Or was it light blue?\u201dYe Xiao was thinking; he acted like he was deep in thought, trying to recall the events, \u201cIt should be sky blue\u2026\u201dHis voice contained a strong sense of uncertainty.The girl exchange glances with the two men and murmured, \u201cSky blue\u2026 It is\u2026 The middle levels of the grade of Tianyuan?\u201dThe men were quiet like two puppets.Ye Xiao understood that the color blue implied the top-grade expert cultivators in the Land of Han-Yang. However, there were still nine levels in this grade.Light blue was the color of the initial-levels, level 1 and level 2; Sky blue was the color of the middle-levels, level 3 and level 4; Acid blue was the color of the high-levels, level 5 and level 6; Sea blue was the color of the peak-levels that people commonly described as the Grandmaster levels of Tianyuan.If it was purple blue, that meant the cultivator was higher than the class of expert cultivators and reached the class of ultimate masters of the world\u2026 Whoever reached this class, wasn\u2019t far from being able to ascend to the Qing-Yun Realm.However, supreme masters in this world that had reached this level and were capable of flight were very few. There were some, but certainly not many.Expert cultivators with sky blue qi were among the top-class cultivators in the martial world. They were absolutely not normal.The girl in cyan suddenly frowned, \u201cBrother Feng\u2026 If the robber is such an expert cultivator, he can\u2019t be some nameless person. Could it be that you have crossed paths with him before?\u201dYe Xiao looked innocent and waved his head as he spoke, \u201cI am doing quite well in dan-making business apparently. I usually concentrate on this and haven\u2019t gotten involved in the martial world. If I wasn\u2019t running out of money, I wouldn\u2019t have taken out the supreme dan beads for the auction. How could I possibly piss off such an expert cultivator?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s weird\u2026\u201d The girl was lost in her thoughts as a frown appeared on her face. She was obviously trying to find a clue from what he had described.The girl didn\u2019t doubt Ye Xiao\u2019s words. In fact, if someone was not extremely talented and had no perseverance in the art of dan-making, they wouldn\u2019t be able to make such world-class supreme dan beads.Because of that, her way of thinking would not lead her to discover the truth.Ye Xiao was gulping down water at the moment, as he felt really thirsty.He had been sweating for such a long time and it was lucky that he hadn\u2019t died from dehydration. Now that he had the time and opportunity, he naturally had to replenish some water.\u201cWhat happened next?\u201d The girl continued with her investigation.\u201cHmm. And then the\u2026 items I had with me were taken\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao sighed and gestured to his body, \u201cAnd now I feel like I have been punched by ten thousand strong men at the same time. In fact, I am exhausted just by sitting here and talking to you.\u201dThe girl smiled politely, \u201cIt is indeed not easy.\u201dYe Xiao asked, \u201cDo you mind if I ask for your name? You saved me today and I will repay you someday.\u201dThe girl thought for a while and said, \u201cIt was a simple favor. That\u2019s all. It is not worth mentioning. My family name is Wen-Ren. Brother Feng, you can call me Lady Chu-Chu.\u201d\u201cChu-Chu\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao praised, \u201cBeautiful name! She who is delicate and touching is certainly a beauty.\u201d[TL note: Chu-Chu, which is \u695a\u695a in Chinese. It is a part of the idiom \u2018\u695a\u695a\u52a8\u4eba\u2019, which means delicate and touching and is mostly used to describe girls.]A gleam of anger appeared on Wen-Ren Chu-Chu\u2019s face: \u201cWhat kind of person are you? I told you to call me Lady Chu-Chu\u2026 Who told you to call me Chu-Chu!\u201dShe casually put the handkerchief away and didn\u2019t touch it again. She smiled softly, \u201cBy the way, did you just say\u2026 that you were taking those items home to make dan beads?\u201dYe Xiao kept his head raised, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cBut what I have been told is\u2026 those supreme dan beads that you auctioned were not made by yourself, right?\u201d Wen-Ren Chu-Chu said cunningly with her eyes half-closed.\u201cThat is a rumor. In fact, I am the unique supreme dan-maker in this land. Only I can make the supreme dan beads; no one else can.\u201d Ye Xiao hurriedly tried to justify himself.However, this declaration made it sound like a cover-up.\u201cHeh heh\u2026\u201d Wen-Ren Chu-Chu smiled meaningfully, like she had already asked all the questions on her mind. She raised her cup and said, \u201cPlease. Brother Feng, drink.\u201dYe Xiao glanced at the handkerchief that was put aside by Wen-Ren Chu-Chu. She had only used it once to wipe her hands. It was still clean and new but it had already been discarded like a worn out pair of shoes.He made an observation about the girl: \u201cThis girl is neat freak.\u201dYe Xiao put down the cup and pretended that he was too weak to hold it. The cup fell down and rolled over to the girl. Wen-Ren Chu-Chu quickly reached out her hand to grab it\u2026Ye Xiao acted fast to grab the cup first and took it back. He then spoke embarrassedly, \u201cPlease forgive me, Lady Chu-Chu. I don\u2019t like people to touch the things I am using\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you a neat freak?\u201d Wen-Ren Chu-Chu raised her head and looked at him for the first time since the conversation started.Ye Xiao hadn\u2019t noticed until now that her eyes were clear blue, like the ocean and the sky, an endless starry sky; they were shockingly beautiful! Her eyelashes were long like two delicate tiny fans, filled with absolute sense of beauty!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIf this girl took off her disguise and revealed her true face, she would be even more beautiful than Su Ye-Yue, I guess.\u201d Somehow, Ye Xiao had such an image in mind.Rubbing his nose, Ye Xiao smiled bitterly, \u201cYes, I am. I am apparently not in my own place, but I still cannot overcome my habit. Gosh. I am sorry.\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu frowned and breathed a sigh of relief. Then she looked at the handkerchief that she had put aside and frowned again.She looked back at Ye Xiao with a sense of terror in her eyes.Ye Xiao lowered his head and drank his water. He had no idea what mistake he had committed this time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 52 \u2013 The Art of Escape And The Regeneration Ink LotusThe East-rising Purple Qi was about to resume its circulation. But what if, at this crucial moment, the girl picked up on his plan? If she noticed and then set a few more restrictions on him, then he would truly be finished. He would have wasted all the efforts he had put in previously, and the day he could escape his plight would move far into the distant future.In fact, Ye Xiao had already begun to calculate his means of escape from the moment he had woken up.But till now, he had still not been given even half a chance to do so. Even though the East-rising Purple Qi\u2019s magical abilities were miraculous and unpredictable and could still circulate slowly when Ye Xiao\u2019s cultivation was limited, his current level of cultivation was still too weak. It would take him quite a long time to break through the restriction.This girl, Wen-Ren Chu-Chu looked gentle and weak, and her voice was soft and delicate. But throughout their whole interaction till now, she had not given Ye Xiao a single opportunity to escape.\u201cBrother Feng, do you really possess mysophobia?\u201d Wen-Ren Chu-Chu\u2019s tone was still as soft as it had always been, but the forbidding quality in her voice was now clear as day.Ye Xiao smiled blandly, \u201cIs it really important right now whether I am mysophobic? The most important thing is that I\u2019m already under your control. Moreover, you have no intention of letting me go. In simpler terms, you have already made up your mind since the moment you saved me.\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu smiled sweetly, \u201cBrother Feng, you said it yourself that the supreme dan beads you refined are unique in the Land of Han-Yang, far surpassing the rest. How can I miss the opportunity to learn more about someone as awe-inspiring as you? So I thought that I should invite you to the Kingdom of Lan-Feng. Only, for this journey, depending on whether you come along comfortably or under compulsion, the process will be very different.\u201dYe Xiao laughed, \u201cLady Chu-Chu, are you threatening me? You do know how I got through the last day, do you not?\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu was startled when she heard that.\u201cThat is true. This guy is short and ordinary-looking, but he is a sturdy man with bones of steel.\u201cPreviously, even when he was suffering from such intense pain, he didn\u2019t even make a sound. He is clearly not the right opponent for physical threats to be effective on.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. But no matter what, Brother Feng\u2019s journey to the Kingdom of Lan-Feng\u2026 is destined to be unavoidable.\u201d Wen-Ren Chu-Chu smiled sweetly and said, \u201cBrother Feng\u2019s cultivation is superior. To avoid any unpleasant accidents, how about I give your body two additional finger pokes?\u201dYe Xiao sighed,\u201dAs expected, she has seen through my plan to stall for time.\u201dHe smiled bitterly, \u201cCan I say\u2026 no?\u201d\u201cOf course you can. But I will still give you a few finger pokes.\u201d Wen-Ren Chu-Chu laughed. Her hands moved as fast as wind. \u2013 Pah Pah Pah! \u2013 She stabbed Ye Xiao\u2019s Jing and Mai with her fingers three more times.The Qi that he had started gathering just now had been disrupted once again. His Jing and Mai were heavily blocked causing all of his previous efforts to be wasted.Ye Xiao sighed and said, \u201cThis is your territory. As expected, my words have no power here. Right, about the Regeneration Ink Lotus\u2026 Lady Wen-Ren, you have spent a fortune to get it but are you sure you know how it should be used? Well, everyone has their own specialisations\u2026\u201dShe replied apathetically, \u201cThat\u2026 Even if I use it wrongly and waste it, I would rather throw it away than come to beg Brother Feng for help. Brother Feng, you can relax. There is no need for you to worry about this\u201dAnother escape route was blocked.But, Ye Xiao was not discouraged at all. He smiled and said, \u201cIf you gain an object without gaining knowledge on how to use it, then you will have completely wasted it. If you really use this lotus incorrectly and throw it away, it would be such a pity. Lady Wen-Ren, you have sacrificed so much for this lotus so that you can save someone\u2019s life with it. But sometimes, if you use medicine improperly, it can turn deadly instead\u2026\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu humphed when she heard that. It seemed like she was dismissive of his words.Ye Xiao ignored her disdain and continued, \u201cBut speaking of the main purpose of the Regeneration Ink Lotus, it is not to simply heal wounds\u2026 but to save lives.\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu\u2019s smile was sweet as she scoffed, \u201cIs that so? Brother Feng\u2019s knowledge is truly vast. You know every detail about the efficacies of spirit medicine.\u201d\u201cPlease Lady Chu-Chu, I am flattered!\u201d Ye Xiao smiled blandly, \u201cI wonder, this item that you have spent so much money on, is it really for saving your father\u2019s life?\u201d\u201cNaturally. My father is fatally ill. Other than the Regeneration Ink Lotus, there are no other materials that can save him!\u201d She spoke gravely.Ye Xiao chuckled, \u201cHeh heh. Lady Chu-Chu\u2019s filial piety is admirable. The only pity is that I don\u2019t believe you\u2026\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu was nonplussed, \u201cYou don\u2019t believe it. What exactly do you not believe?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe that you bought the Regeneration Ink Lotus to save your father\u2019s life. Because although the main purpose of the Regeneration Ink Lotus is indeed to return souls and revive lives, it can only save women; it cannot save the life of a man\u2026 So, Lady Chu-chu, when you said that you wanted the item to save your father\u2019s life at the auction, I didn\u2019t believe you at all. But I wonder, with regards to what I have said, does Lady Chu-chu believe me or not?!\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu was still smiling, but her smile had already stiffened. The corner of her lips twitched as she said coldly, \u201cFrom ancient times till now, it has been said that the Regeneration Ink Lotus is mystical medicine from the heavens with miraculous effects. So why is it that from Master Feng\u2019s mouth, I hear so many misgivings?\u201dYe Xiao picked up the teacup and drank. He said, \u201cIt is a saying from the ancient times indeed. But I think that there has been no one in this Land of Han-Yang who has actually used it to save lives before\u2026 As far as I know, although it is a well-known as death-defying medicine, all those who have ever taken it have eventually died\u2026\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu\u2019s face finally stiffened.Ye Xiao pretended to not see her reaction, and continued, \u201cEven though the diseases were initially cured after the lotus was used\u2026 but years later, all of them died suddenly due to inexplicable reasons. There has been no exception\u2026\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu\u2019s eyes were twinkling and she didn\u2019t speak.\u201cThe reason is simple\u2026 The Regeneration Ink Lotus is something with an extremely cold attribute. Although it can cure every disease like a work of a god, the frigid energy of the lotus will remain within the patient\u2019s body. The effects are invisible but continuous. Eventually, the patient dies. There is no one in the Land of Han-Yang whose body can possibly survive such extreme effects. So in the end, all those who took the Regeneration Ink Lotus died with their veins frozen!\u201d Ye Xiao stared into Wen-Ren Chu-Chu\u2019s eyes and spoke slowly.\u201cWhat an excellent speech.\u201d Wen-Ren Chu-chu\u2019s poker face remained as she clapped her hands, \u201cNow, I am finally starting to believe that you are indeed a supreme dan-maker.\u201d\u201cHowever, it seems that Lady Wen-Ren does not feel anxious even after hearing my excellent speech\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao said blandly, \u201cSo\u2026 this lady must be confident that the patient can surely defuse this power of cold\u2026 But there is absolutely nobody in this Land of Han-yang who has the ability to do so. So, this person that you want to save, let me guess \u2014 Could it be that this person is from\u2026 above the sky?\u201dHis words were like a thunderous blow to her. Her body suddenly turned rigid. Turning her head, she stared at him with a dark expression. Then, a sinister smile appeared on her face, a trace of killing intent was revealed in her gaze.\u201cIf the person is from above the sky\u2026 then my deduction is quite reasonable.\u201d Ye Xiao acted as if nothing was out of the ordinary and went on speaking with fervor, \u201cHowever, if my deduction is true, then Lady Chu-chu, you indeed intend to save someone\u2019s life. But that person is absolutely not your father or your mother\u2026 It must be a woman though.\u201d\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d Wen-Ren Chu-chu\u2019s slender fingers had already started to turn pale.\u201cBecause even if the person is from above the sky, the ones who are able to make maximum use of this lotus have one thing in common \u2014 they are women.\u201d Ye Xiao chuckled, \u201cMoreover, if she wants to cure the disease in her body with this Regeneration Ink Lotus, there is still another condition which remains to be fulfilled.\u201dYe Xiao enunciated each word clearly, \u201cThat woman has to be a virgin! Women\u2019s natural attribute is Yin, so they can certainly partially disperse the cold. Even so, the risk still remains. When the frigid energy finally explodes, the consequences could be lethal. Only virgins who possess Yuan Yin bodies are able to disperse the cold energy to the maximum extent!\u201d\u201cBut then, how could a virgin possibly bear children? She can\u2019t. So she is naturally not your mother. If it\u2019s neither your father nor your mother, then who else is there for whom you\u2019d be willing to put so much effort into healing? This person\u2019s identity is almost about to be revealed.\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu clenched her small hands into fists before immediately loosening them. Her chest rose and fell once, before she spoke indifferently, \u201cGo on.\u201dYe Xiao had utter confidence that the answer in his heart was correct.He said blandly, \u201cThis woman be must at least an expert cultivator\u2026\u201d\u201cIf she isn\u2019t, she can\u2019t have such profound knowledge, let alone foster such a brilliant heir like you\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao\u2019s narrowed his eyes. Under this woman\u2019s watchful gaze, he could do nothing to escape. So Ye Xiao could only rely on his profound insight so as to make a most shocking conclusion, which was also closest to the truth.Before this day, the Xiao Monarch had never thought in either of his lives that he would fall under a girl\u2019s control. On top of this, he was being restrained tightly by his opponent and had no means of escape.When the word \u2018heir\u2019 was spoken, Wen-Ren Chu-Chu\u2019s body once again turned rigid. She bit her rosy lips with her white teeth and the coldness in her eyes became deeper.\u201cAnd I also know, that even if you feed her the lotus and temporarily bring her disease under control, the woman you are trying to save can at most live for another ten years before she breathes her last\u2026 After the ten years, she will definitely perish, that is unless you find a Regeneration Jade Lotus, whose medicinal quality even surpasses the Regeneration Ink Lotus. Only if you find the Regeneration Jade Lotus, can you\u2026 extend her lifespan by five hundred years. After that, when the five hundred years have passed\u2026 you will need the even higher-classed Renascence Jade Lotus to heal her again and completely solve her life-and-death crisis!\u201cOtherwise, even if she reaches a much higher level in cultivation, as long as she does not consume that Renascence Jade Lotus, she cannot avoid her fate, which is to die after all her veins freeze completely.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, everyone, man or woman, supreme master or not, who takes the Regeneration Ink Lotus will die if the last step is not accomplished. There are no exceptions. The only thing that can save her is the Renascence Jade Lotus.\u201d\u201cWell to be honest, although the Regeneration Ink Lotus is rare, it is possible to find one if you search hard enough. At least you already have one. As for the Regeneration Jade Lotus\u2026 I\u2019m afraid that there only exist a few in the entire mortal realm.\u201dYe Xiao said nonchalantly, \u201cEven if you are lucky enough to find the Regeneration Jade Lotus, then\u2026 Where are you going to find the Renascence Jade Lotus? As far as I know\u2026 from ancient times till now, among the whole heavens and earth, there has been\u2026 only one!\u201dThe expression on Wen-Ren Chu-Chu\u2019s face instantly changed .\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Beg me!\u201cBy the way, I wonder if Lady Chu-Chu knows that there is a restriction regarding the usage of the Renascence Jade Lotus? That is, the Renascence Jade Lotus is only effective on a virgin body\u2026\u201dYe Xiao\u2019s lips curled into a mischievous smile and he said, \u201cWhat a shame. For a woman to cultivate to the extent that she is able to use the Renascence Jade Lotus\u2026 the most conservative estimate for someone to reach that level is three thousand years\u2026 And if she is still a virgin by then\u2026 I don\u2019t know if she is lucky or miserable\u2026 Haha, haha\u2026\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu could tolerate no more. She jumped up and grabbed Ye Xiao\u2019s clothes and actually lifted his whole body up to drag him close to her face. She gnashed her teeth and threatened with a low voice, \u201cYou dare to laugh! Laugh one more time and I\u2019ll show you the consequences!\u201dKilling intent had filled her eyes as she was embarrassed to the point of rage.Ye Xiao\u2019s whole body was completely powerless as he leaned against her hands. He had difficulty breathing but was still laughing loudly. \u201cHahahahahaha\u2026. Of course I dare to laugh. Why wouldn\u2019t I dare? Lady Chu-Chu, your wrath right now is truly terrifying. Only, do you really dare to kill me?\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu glared at him in hatred as different emotions flickered in her eyes. In an instant, her beautiful big eyes was filled with multiple complicated emotions.As she breathed heavily, her breasts rose and fell violently, like the rough waves of the ocean. This captivating scene was enough to move anyone\u2019s heart.Ye Xiao who had been lifted in front of her chest glanced downwards as he said blandly, \u201cIt seems Lady Chu-chu should be a gorgeous beauty\u2026 Those breasts, they are so fair\u2026\u201d\u201cAhh!\u201d With a cry of shock, Wen-Ren Chu-Chu\u2019s hands moved violently as she flung Ye Xiao far away from her. She then scrambled to tidy up her clothes.Ye Xiao\u2019s whole body was instantly tossed over 20 meters away and landed heavily on the floor. He had just recovered from the serious injury and his cultivation had been blocked. And now, his body was subjected to such a serious fall. His bones cracked as he nearly fainted from the pain. However, he still laughed recklessly, \u201cTo be able to see such a youthful sight! Even if I had died from the fall, it would still be worth it. Hahahahaha\u2026\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu\u2019s neck had turned red from embarrassment. She glared at Ye Xiao, now completely enraged. It wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if she decided to tear him apart and devour him.However, she remained motionless for a long while. Afterwards, she smiled and twirled her long bangs as she spoke demurely, \u201cBrother Feng\u2026 You\u2019re really such a disgusting person. Just now, my hand almost slipped and killed you\u2026\u201dIf she had been angry, furious, or even if she had rushed over and beaten him to death, he wouldn\u2019t feel surprised, much less feel scared. However, when she smiled shyly like this, Ye Xiao felt his hair standing on end. Despite the warmth of the room, he shuddered.\u201cThis girl actually calmed down in such a short time under such a situation. She is absolutely not an ordinary person!\u201dJust what kind of place was this Land of Han-Yang? Why were there extraordinary girls popping up everywhere? First there was that Xiu Er who was fearfully shrewd. Now there was this Wen-Ren Chu-Chu who was calm and intelligent, her wits frighteningly sharp. Even though the Xiao Monarch possessed a vast sea of knowledge, he had neither heard of nor seen such amazing women!\u201cIs that so?\u201d Ye Xiao patted the dust off his clothes and stood up quietly. He was limping as though he had been worn ragged but was still filled with a sense of ease. He smiled peacefully and said, \u201cIt is a pity that you dare not kill me.\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu looked at him with a complicated expression and said, \u201cWho are you? Who the hell are you?\u201d\u201cI am a dan-maker. A dan-maker is supposed to know more than you do, especially in the field of medicine.\u201d Ye Xiao answered apathetically, \u201cAnd this field, is coincidentally where your request falls into. So you really don\u2019t dare to kill me.\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu had been convinced that her poise and demeanor were at least among the pinnacle of the Land of Han-Yang. However, she had already acted inelegantly several times because of the anger caused by Ye Xiao\u2019s actions.And she couldn\u2019t do anything about it.What did it feel like to be unable to take action against a helpless restrained prisoner?It would be hard to describe. But it must be a feeling which combined extreme disgust and depression!\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Wen-Ren Chu-Chu exhaled deeply and smiled gently again.\u201cFirst of all, remove my restraints. I feel really uncomfortable when my body is restrained.\u201d Ye Xiao spoke blandly, \u201cI need to operate my martial arts to recover as soon as possible.\u201dHe didn\u2019t wait for Wen-Ren Chu-Chu to speak and continued to say, \u201cOh right. I think there is a high probability that I can help the person you are trying to save defuse the ten years crisis with or without the Regeneration Ink Lotus\u2026\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu\u2019s eyes lit up and she bit her lips, \u201cIs that for real? Ten years\u2026 What about ten years later?\u201d\u201cHeh heh. That will depend on my mood.\u201d Ye Xiao shrugged his shoulders and said, \u201cI believe you are also aware that the Regeneration Ink Lotus you\u2019re holding is already turning grey. That is to say, this lotus is about to become a Regeneration Jade Lotus\u2026\u201d\u201cHowever, although this evolution is rather fast, it still requires at least one to two hundred years. And you only have ten years before you need it. If this lotus doesn\u2019t turn into a Regeneration Jade Lotus in ten years time\u2026 The person you are taking care of now will only have a single path \u2013 death.\u201d\u201cIn other words, even if I were to help you get through the ten years crisis without the Regeneration Ink Lotus, you will still face the same situation in ten years time because you have no means to turn this Regeneration Ink Lotus into a Regeneration Jade Lotus in ten years.\u201dYe Xiao extended a finger and said, \u201cI have to say that you are most fortunate, because I can solve the problem!\u201d\u201cYou can? You can make the lotus complete its evolution earlier?\u201d Wen-Ren Chu-Chu raised her head instantly and stared at Ye Xiao with shining eyes.\u201cBut if I continue to be restrained like this, how can I be in high spirits? Even if I know the method, I might not be able to recall it right now.\u201dYe Xiao humphed and lifted his head proudly, an expression saying \u2018I am absolutely blackmailing you\u2019 appeared on his face.\u201cI can cure it, but since you treat me this way, I won\u2019t. Beg me!\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu could hardly control her hatred, to the extent that the roots of her teeth were itching.Ye Xiao smiled infuriatingly as he raised his cup, \u201cThis tea is really not bad. You should drink more, Lady Chu-Chu.\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu bit her lower lip as she stared at him. Suddenly, she smiled sweetly and said softly, \u201cBrother Feng, no matter what, it was I who saved your life this time. And I have been nursing you with water and medicine for the past few days. Will you deny this favor from me, Brother Feng?\u201dYe Xiao didn\u2019t buy it at all and said, \u201cI do not agree with what you just said, Lady Chu-Chu. Why is it that I hear an intent of \u2018forcing me to repay your favor\u2019 in your voice? Besides, what do you mean by telling me that you saved my life? That guy never had any intention of killing me. If he did, with his spectacular strength, I wouldn\u2019t be able to resist at all. I would have already died eight hundred times.\u201d\u201cAnd there\u2019s more.\u201d Ye Xiao took a breath, \u201cIf someone else had found me, that person may have treated me as an honored guest. Not everybody treats the dan-maker capable of refining supreme dans so contemptuously. You\u2019ve only fed me water and medicine. What kind of service is this anyway? That would be the very least other people would do. Even if they don\u2019t treat me like a forefather, they would never block my Jing and Mai and keep me as a prisoner in such an uncourteous way.\u201d\u201cTreat you like a forefather?\u201d Wen-Ren Chu-Chu looked at his face, which could barely be considered righteous but still ordinary, and felt a strong urge to spit on it.\u201cI saved you but you don\u2019t feel grateful. That\u2019s still fine. Now you actually want to be treated like a forefather. What kind of person are you? Do you even have a sense of shame?\u201dThe sweet smile on Wen-Ren Chu-Chu\u2019s face was becoming increasingly strained. She said, \u201cBrother Feng, could you please tell me your solution first? If it really works, I swear, I will free you at once and apologize to you in earnest. And I will never restrict your freedom again.\u201d\u201cYou sure?\u201d Ye Xiao looked at her, his eyes narrowed.\u201cI promise!\u201d Wen-Ren Chu-Chu spoke seriously.\u201cBut I don\u2019t trust you.\u201d Ye Xiao coughed and said leisurely.\u201cYOU!\u201d Wen-Ren Chu-Chu\u2019s almond-shaped eyes opened widely.\u201cOnly women and small-minded men are hard to get along with. I am not sure if you are small-minded, but I am pretty sure you are a woman!\u201d Ye Xiao was completely at ease as he continued, \u201cAnd you don\u2019t even meet me with your true face. Tell me, even if you break your promise, what can I do about it?\u201d\u201cThere is a chance that once you get the prescription from me, you\u2019ll just kill me and bury me instantly. And then, you\u2019ll start to make a fortune with my prescription\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao waved his head, \u201cThe hearts of people in the martial world are dark and sinister. I have to guard myself. No matter what, I must guarantee myself a path of retreat.\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu\u2019s chest started to rise and fall again because of anger. She looked at Ye Xiao with her wide-opened eyes that were filled with fury, no longer able to maintain her elegant demeanor and sweet smile. She shouted angrily, \u201cHow can I be compared to an ordinary woman! I am Lan-Feng Kingdom\u2019s\u2026\u201dShe suddenly stopped at the middle of her speech, knowing that she would expose herself if she completed her sentence. Her fury was even greater than before as she said viciously, \u201cHow do I gain your trust?\u201d\u201cNever mind. A dignified man like me cannot be bothered to concern myself with the fussy behavior of a little girl. I\u2019ll accept that you served me to a certain extent so I will tell you my prescription in return.\u201d Ye Xiao became generous. \u201cOnly I am able to proceed with my prescription anyway. You can\u2019t learn it even after you know what it is.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou\u2026 You\u2026\u201d Wen-Ren Chu-Chu was extremely speechless.As she looked at this Feng Zhi-Ling in front of her, she could only feel a sullen rage stuck in her throat that she could neither swallow nor spit out. She wished to stuff a dirty pair of socks that had been worn continuously for hundreds of years without being washed in his loathsome mouth.\u201cSince you didn\u2019t worry about telling me, what was the point of saying those words? To piss me off intentionally? Besides, what do you mean I did serve you to a certain extent? Could you even be any more cheeky?! You behave like that and you dare to call yourself a man? Contemptible, impudent, indelicate and paltry \u2013 those are words that fit you!\u201d\u201cAccording to my estimations\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao looked at Wen-Ren Chu-Chu\u2019s expression and said, \u201cThe person you are trying to save must have encountered this crisis because of a special martial arts that she has been cultivating\u2026 That martial arts has been passed from generation to generation for a long time, and is fundamentally defective\u2026 The Regeneration Ink Lotus, the Regeneration Jade Lotus and the Renascence Jade Lotus happen to be the materials that can fix the defects\u2026\u201d\u201cAlthough this martial arts is defective, it is extremely powerful and easy to upgrade. Even a beginner can have the potential to dominate a certain realm\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao looked at Wen-Ren Chu-Chu whose face was turning darker and darker. He spoke slowly, \u201cIt seems you do know that I am not talking about the Land of Han-Yang\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 54 \u2013 Are You A Man?Wen-Ren Chu-Chu spoke coldly, \u201cHow could the Land of Han-Yang deserve such a marvelous martial art!\u201dYe Xiao indifferently replied, \u201cIf the technique Lady Chu-Chu is cultivating is unluckily the same one as the person that you are trying to save, then you will face the same problem yourself in the future\u2026\u201dThe Xiao Monarch suddenly started to thoroughly inspect her body from the head to the toes.Wen-Ren Chu-Chu felt her hair stand on end, as though his eyes had unscrupulously stripped her of all of her clothes. She shouted, completely enraged, \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d\u201cLooking at your body\u2019s\u2026 current condition\u2026 Hmmm. Lady Chu-Chu\u2019s strength, Jing and Mai, and bones\u2026 You\u2019re truly a martial arts prodigy rarely seen even in a thousand years. And, the most uncommon thing about you is\u2026 that you have a pure Yin female body.\u201dYe Xiao praised unabashedly, \u201cYou\u2019re truly a brilliant talent.\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu was furious with him for his shameless gaze, but she was also shocked at the same time, [He\u2026 can actually see through my martial potential and natural endowment!]\u201cBut it is a pity that\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao said, \u201cThe better your endowment and the better your talent, the faster your martial art will upgrade during cultivation. When it upgrades faster, it also means that you are dying faster. I really don\u2019t know whether I should congratulate you or\u2026\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu was completely speechless.[Does this guy\u2026 even know how to talk?]Wen-Ren Chu-Chu\u2019s expression was frigid as ice, without even the trace of a smile as she spoke blandly, \u201cBrother Feng, there is only one thing that I want to hear from your mouth\u2026 Do you truly have a practical solution or not?\u201dWhat she meant was \u2018I am not here to listen to your words about me dying early\u2019.\u201cWhy can\u2019t you be patient? I am currently explaining the solution to you, am I not? How can I make you understand the solution without explaining the problem clearly? Fine. Let\u2019s put it in a simple way. The solution mostly depends on the martial art that I am cultivating.\u201d Ye Xiao spoke peacefully, \u201cI am a dan-maker and the fire I use to make dan is totally different from the others. For that reason, I can make the legendary supreme dan\u2026 And my fire, which exists in the dan-makers\u2019 myth, is the Purple Sky-fire!\u201d\u201cThe Purple Sky-fire?\u201d Wen-Ren Chu-Chu frowned, furrowing her pretty eyebrows.[Does this kind of fire really exist? It is not just a myth, is it?]Ye Xiao was totally calm even though he had just made up a \u2018myth\u2019, and he said, \u201cThe Purple Sky-fire is the No.1 sky-fire in the world. It is the progenitor of the dan fire. If I wasn\u2019t highly talented and lucky, I wouldn\u2019t have found it\u2026 In other words, in the world, there is absolutely no other person who has this kind of dan fire!\u201d[ TL note: \u2018dan fire\u2019 is the fire that is used to make the dan beads.]\u201cAre you absolutely certain?\u201d Wen-Ren Chu-Chu frowned.\u201cIf there is another person who has the same skill as me, Lady Chu-Chu\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao spoke arrogantly, \u201cI, Feng Zhi-Ling, can make a bet with you now. If there is another person like that, I swear I will spend my entire life making dan for you, at least one batch per month, with at least ten beads per batch, and every one of them will be a supreme dan bead with dan clouds!\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu was observing his face. Her eyes flickered and her expression wavered.Such a promise could totally make her heart tremble!Among other things, just the words \u2018every one of them will be a supreme dan bead with dan clouds\u2019 could already thrill people to the point where their blood would boil!It seems that the \u2018Purple Sky-fire\u2019 was truly a mythical fire!\u201cSince you have already said it to this extent, how can I not believe it?\u201d Wen-Ren Chu-Chu said, \u201cJust\u2026 Can I have a look at your Purple Sky-fire? Seeing is believing. I am sure you can at least fulfill this small request of mine!\u201dYe Xiao said blandly, \u201cUnfortunately, my dan fire is invisible. However, it can be sensed.\u201d\u201cThat is the main reason I am so confident.\u201d Ye Xiao looked at her calmly, \u201cThat martial art I was talking about, I believe you have cultivated it into a certain level. I am afraid you are going to need the Regeneration Ink Lotus soon\u2026 How about this. I will first solve your crisis right here and let you feel it yourself\u2026 I will make sure that you won\u2019t be needing the Regeneration Ink Lotus once i\u2019m done, you will only require the Regeneration Jade Lotus when the time comes. You won\u2019t doubt it if you experience it yourself, will you?\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu took a deep breath, \u201cReally?\u201dShe had the kind of talent which made her a prodigy compared to all her fellow disciples. It was said that her cultivating rate was so high that even the departed founder of her sect couldn\u2019t have rivaled it.However, as Ye Xiao stated, the faster she cultivated, the closer she got to the crisis.It might take three hundred years for others to reach the level that would cause a crisis to occur, but it might only take her ten years.That thought had caused her many sleepless nights in the past.The Regeneration Ink Lotus wasn\u2019t something easy to find.It was an extremely rare and inaccessible treasure.Where could she get it?That was a problem.She thought that if the man in front of her could truly solve her problem, it would be much better to stay friends with him rather than capture him and force him to become a slave that made dan for her!\u201cAbsolutely! As real as the gold and the silver!\u201dYe Xiao felt relieved. He had at least passed through half of the dangerous situation.Otherwise, with his present condition, as the girl was attentive and decisive, it was absolutely possible that this girl would take him to the Kingdom of Lan-Feng.If that happened\u2026 it would be a real problem for him.Wen-Ren Chu-Chu smiled softly again and reached her hand out to poke his body with her finger a few times. Ye Xiao felt relieved as an indistinct power surged into his body. The restriction on his body had finally been removed.His martial arts returned to its natural condition and he was finally at ease.Wen-Ren Chu-Chu smiled sweetly and performed an elegant bow, \u201cBrother Feng, I apologize for offending you earlier. Please trust me. What I wanted to do at the beginning was to make friends with you. There was no other intention in my mind.\u201d\u201cOf course I trust you.\u201d Ye Xiao smiled sincerely \u2013 he lied without even blinking his eyes.At the same time, he was thinking, \u201cIf I really trust you, I am the biggest fool in the world!\u201d\u2026Wen-Ren Chu-Chu\u2019s temperament became enthusiastic towards Ye Xiao. She ordered her servants to prepare a meal, a grand meal actually, and treated him like a forefather indeed.The pavilion.The soft wind.The green willows.The red flowers.A man and a woman sat opposite to and looked at each other. A breeze was blowing causing the white silks surrounding them to flutter.It was like a graceful scene taken straight out of a poem.However the only blemish in this otherwise perfect scene was that both of them had unattractive appearances. It was more or less a killjoy\u2026\u201cBrother Feng, how can this problem be solved? Could you please tell me something about it, so that I can be prepared, at least mentally.\u201d Wen-Ren Chu-Chu raised her cup and said with a smile.Ye Xiao coughed and said, \u201cThere is nothing to prepare really. The process is quite simple. You will only need to relax your whole body and let your power operate by itself. And then I will perform my Purple Sky-fire using my palm and place my hand on your belly where the dantian is located. The negative influence caused by your cultivation of that martial arts will be removed bit by bit after every cycle. Bit by bit, it will be wiped clean\u2026\u201dHe looked at Wen-Ren Chu-Chu and said, \u201cI think your cultivation has reached quite a high grade, but it\u2019s still not at the Grade of Tianyuan yet, right? If so, it will only take 36 cycles to remove the impact that has been accumulating during your cultivation\u2026 After this, you can safely continue with your cultivation. There will be no more negative influences during your cultivation until you reach the next key level, wherein you\u2019ll need the Regeneration Jade Lotus to get through. My solution is going to have an effect instantly. You are the one who will be taking it, so you will feel it. There is no way I can fool you about this\u2026\u201dYe Xiao kept explaining about the process, but totally missed the blush on Wen-Ren Chu-Chu\u2019s face. In fact, she was so embarrassed that, let alone her face, even her neck had turned beet red.Her two small eyes were like agates.[Relax my whole body? Your hand on my belly?That\u2026 That\u2026]Wen-Ren Chu-Chu wanted to kick him to death![You actually spat that out like it didn\u2019t even matter! But this is about the reputation of a girl! The belly of a girl. Do you think it is something a man can simply just\u2026 put his hand on?]Poor Ye Xiao had been a virgin for two lifetimes. He had never cared about such \u2018minor details\u2019. So he kept talking with fervor as if nothing had happened, \u201cNaturally, if you have already reached the Grade of Tianyuan, the time will be much longer. It will at least take 99 cycles. Besides, I will need to operate the Purple Sky-fire on both of my palms. One of them will be placed over your dantian producing suction, while the other will be placed on your tailbone producing a propelling force. One pulls while the other pushes; my two hands work cooperatively. That will make sure the impact of the cold inside your body will be completely removed.\u201d\u201cRight. There is another thing that is important. That is you will not be allowed to wear anything. At least, the dantian and the tailbone are absolutely not allowed to be covered. Otherwise, the flow of cold will be reversed at any time. Once the cold starts to reverse, you will die instantly! You are an expert in cultivation. I don\u2019t think I need to explain further, right?\u201dYe Xiao finally finished his lecture. He raised his head and looked at Wen-Ren Chu-Chu\u2019s face and found that she was already so bashful that her face had turned red; even her neck was red at the moment. She stared fiercely at him like she was going to swallow him.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Is there anything you still don\u2019t understand?\u201d Now Master Feng got confused.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?! You tell me what\u2019s wrong?!\u201d Wen-Ren Chu-Chu finally exploded, \u201cFeng Zhi-Ling! Answer me. Are you a man or not?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euYe Xiao was stunned and said, \u201cAh? That\u2026 Can\u2019t you tell? Do I need to prove it?\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu meant to say was- Are you a man or not? Am I a woman or not? A distinction should be made between males and females and do yo know that?However, she had just spoken out the first sentence before she felt too ashamed to complete her thoughts, and Feng Zhi-Ling simply countered her questions with questions of his own.He even showed a confused look which showed innocence and surprise.She suddenly felt like spitting out blood.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He looked innocent and confused and his eyes seemed pure.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Wen-Ren Chu-Chu nearly spat blood, \u201cCan\u2019t you consider\u2026 the distance that should be kept between men and women? The solution you were describing\u2026 How could you\u2026 How could I\u2026\u201dShe was too shy to continue.Ye Xiao finally understood and said, \u201cUrh\u2026 That\u2026\u201dHe took the drumstick out of his mouth at once. Suddenly, he too started to feel embarrassed and didn\u2019t know what to do. So he coughed and stuttered, \u201cThat\u2026 I am so sorry about it\u2026 Well\u2026 Ahem\u2026 I didn\u2019t consider it well enough\u2026 Forgive me. I\u2019m really\u2026 I\u2026 I\u2026 I have never touched a girl in my whole life\u2026 Ahem\u2026 So I didn\u2019t give enough consideration to this kind of thing\u2026 I thought that since you were also a cultivator\u2026 maybe\u2026 you probably\u2026 wouldn\u2019t care\u2026\u201dYe Xiao was so ashamed that he was babbling incoherently.This was the first time that, right when the Xiao Monarch was brimming with confidence and overflowing with eloquence, he encountered such embarrassment.He couldn\u2019t deny it. Even if he tried his best to deny it, it would only sound like a lame excuse.Ye Xiao truly didn\u2019t consider such an aspect: [I am just helping you with your illness, am I not?]Other than solving the problem, he didn\u2019t take anything else into consideration.When Wen-Ren Chu-Chu saw the tough guy, Master Feng, suddenly become so awkward, she couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u2013 Pu \u2013 She wouldn\u2019t have thought that this Master Feng, who looked to be over thirty years old, would actually act like a young boy when facing this matter.This kind of squirming, this kind of awkward embarrassment, this kind of shameful helplessness \u2013 these were definitely not things that he could fake.[It seems that this guy is too focused on dan-making and hasn\u2019t been in any relationship yet. He really doesn\u2019t think much about things between a man and a woman\u2026] Wen-Ren Chu-Chu didn\u2019t know why she came up with such an idea.[What he just said means he really didn\u2019t consider that. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t be so embarrassed. It seems, that I am the one who has bad thoughts\u2026]Wen-Ren Chu-Chu continued her train of thoughts.[This Feng Zhi-Ling is good at playing tricks, has a thick hide, does well in cultivation, is a supreme dan-maker, has deep thoughts and tough bones. He also knows much about human nature and is well informed. But why on earth doesn\u2019t he understand anything about stuff between men and women?]Wen-Ren Chu-Chu was so confused and felt weird.She suddenly felt that the guy in front of her was filled with contradictions.\u201cWell. I am sorry\u2026 But Lady Wen-Ren, you really should give it a try. After all, it concerns your life and your future accomplishments\u2026\u201d Saying this, Ye Xiao peeked at her face and said, \u201cPlease don\u2019t worry. I don\u2019t have any improper interests in you\u2026\u201dYe Xiao meant to say: [I will cure you and you let me go. We become friends. I won\u2019t think much about you, and you won\u2019t need to worry too much about me.]But he shouldn\u2019t have peeked at her face when he was saying that.Wen-Ren Chu-Chu was so angry that she had nearly fainted![You looked at my face while telling me you have no interest in me?]\u201cDo you mean to say that I am ugly?! So I\u2019m not attractive to you?\u201d Wen-Ren Chu-Chu gnashed her teeth and suddenly forgot to feel shy. Her face actually turned green.\u201cNo\u2026 No\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao realized that he had said something wrong. He kept waving his hand while babbling incoherently, \u201cNo, no, no\u2026 I meant that you were ugly\u2026 Wait, no\u2026 I meant you are not that ugly\u2026 No, no, no, Lady Wen-Ren, please let me explain\u2026 You know what I meant, don\u2019t you\u2026 You should know what I meant\u2026 Ahhhh! ~~~\u201dAnd then there was vegetable soup on the Xiao Monarch\u2019s face.This was because Lady Chu-Chu was so angry that she had exploded and threw the soup onto his face.\u2013 Tok tok tok\u2026 \u2013While Master Feng was busy wiping the soup off his face and was about to shout out \u2018what\u2019s wrong with you\u2019, he only saw an alluring view of her back leaving in a rage!Every step of hers was making the floor creak loudly!She must have been furious at that moment!They had been drinking leisurely and it had been a poetic scene, but suddenly, it had completely broken down. The soup was dripping down his face onto his body; on his shoulder, there seemed to be a fish bone. The fine silk behind him was now stained by the soup as it hung limply downwards like a dead fish\u2026Ye Xiao sat there stunned for a long time, unable to say a word.He eventually just shook his head and sighed, \u201cWhy are you so short-tempered. I told you we\u2019re all cultivators. I can\u2019t believe you don\u2019t even understand that. I\u2019m helping you\u2026 I tried to make it clear and you actually treated me like this\u2026 Gosh\u2026 Whoever is unfortunate enough to marry you in the future must be blind\u2026\u201dWithout a word, he walked back to his room to change his clothes. He wanted to take a bath but he didn\u2019t have such a luxurious service.\u201cA decent man won\u2019t fight against a woman!\u201d Ye Xiao thought, \u201cLet alone that I really don\u2019t have a chance to win\u2026\u201d\u2026After a while, Wen-Ren Chu-Chu walked back in, leisurely with her hands behind her back. She smiled sweetly and said, \u201cBrother Feng, I apologise for startling you just now.\u201dYe Xiao sighed and threw up his hands, speaking sincerely, \u201cSure. Lady Chu-Chu, if you don\u2019t care about your health, or if you don\u2019t want to live anymore\u2026 You should just treat me as a captive again. You know how stubborn I can be. Don\u2019t expect me to cure your illness anymore, let alone remain friends with you\u2026\u201d\u201cIt was my fault.\u201d Wen-Ren Chu-Chu smiled softly, \u201cBrother Feng, you\u2019re a generous man. You surely wouldn\u2019t care, right?\u201dYe Xiao spoke angrily, \u201cHow do you know whether I am generous or not? Even I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m a generous man! Do I care? Of course I care!\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu was surprised.[How could this guy be so narrow-minded in front of a girl? What kind of man is he?!]But after she spoke a few more reconcilatory words, Ye Xiao knew that he couldn\u2019t push her too far. The advantages that he could get had already been attained. He definitely couldn\u2019t piss off this mad woman again\u2026If this unrestrained girl would lose her temper once again, then it would truly seem that the only route which awaited him, would be that of a prisoner.Wen-Ren Chu-Chu was upset.[What do I do?I don\u2019t care about my life. If I will die, so be it\u2026 But what should I do for my beloved master who treats me like her own daughter?The opportunity is right in front of me. I have to take it.If I don\u2019t, how can I know if this guy is lying or not?If I do it, what about my reputation?]Being touched on the belly by a man\u2026 Her entire body would start burning up just thinking about this!Even though she was shrewd and decisive, she felt helpless and hesitant.\u201cDo you mind if I ask about your cultivation level\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao talked first.It wasn\u2019t a good situation if they kept silent at the moment, so Ye Xiao thought that since he was a man, he should talk first.Wen-Ren Chu-Chu answered casually, \u201cLevel 9 of the Grade of Diyuan\u2026\u201d\u201cAhem!\u201d Ye Xiao coughed and couldn\u2019t help sweating.[What the hell. Such a little girl has actually reached the ninth level of the Grade of Diyuan. It was lucky that I didn\u2019t fight against her, otherwise she could\u2019ve killed me with a single finger\u2026 I am only at the 1st level of the Grade of Diyuan\u2026]\u201cYou really are a genius.\u201d Ye Xiao said, \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s quite simple. If you care about your reputation so much, and if the person you are trying to save isn\u2019t that important to you, we can just wait for several years. Another opportunity may arise in the future.\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu asked, \u201cWhat do you mean? What opportunity?\u201dYe Xiao said, \u201cYou are at a high level of cultivation for sure, but there is still quite a distance before you will need the Regeneration Ink Lotus. You at least need more time\u2026 Maybe, by then, you might have already married someone. If you come to me for the cure with your husband, that will be fine. If so, you won\u2019t need to worry too much about me and your problems with reputation will become not so serious\u2026\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu raised her eyebrows again with her eyes wide-open. She became extremely angry and shouted, \u201cDo you mean to say my reputation isn\u2019t important once I get married? Feng Zhi-Ling. What do you mean by that? Do you feel good making a fool out of me?\u201dYe Xiao\u2019s eyes widened and he was speechless.[What the hell!What do you want me to say then?If we do it now, you will care about your bloody reputation! Yet you still want to be alive! You still want to improve!I suggested another solution for your own good, but you don\u2019t bloody accepted it and actually got bloody angry!If you really care that much about your reputation, why don\u2019t you just die with it! At least I won\u2019t need to be in a dilemma! Even saying one word is like fighting a huge battle against millions of enemies\u2026This is so fxxking annoying!]\u201cI will do it!\u201d When Wen-Ren Chu-Chu said this, the blush nearly spread to her chest.She made up her mind and thought, [This is not my true appearance anyway. This prick will never know my true face\u2026Besides, the situation with master doesn\u2019t allow for any more time to be wasted.I am her inheritor. How can I not take the chance even though it is a small one? If I need to be aggrieved\u2026 so be it.Instead, I should see it as getting bitten by a dog\u2026]\u201cWhat? Did you just say\u2026 that you\u2019ll do it?\u201d Ye Xiao was shocked when he heard her words.He had been practicing his power. The two extremes, gelidity and heat, and he had become proficient enough to operate them as he wished.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe had made up the \u2018Purple Sky-fire\u2019 earlier, but it wasn\u2019t a complete lie. The process of curing her was to use the scorching yang qi to disperse the cold qi in her body. This hot qi was indeed produced by the East-rising Purple Qi, so there was nothing wrong to call it the Purple Sky-fire.The name might be fake, but even if there was a kind of dan fire named the Purple Sky-fire, it would definitely fail to match the most powerful martial art in the universe \u2013 the East-rising Purple Qi!It was the invincible opponent of every other martial art!Therefore, Ye Xiao was confident about the cure. It\u2019s just that, the way he needed to utilize it was unacceptable.However, he hadn\u2019t thought that after the girl talked so much about her reputation, said \u2018no\u2019 so many times, and actually threw soup in his face, she would actually come around and say \u2018yes\u2019?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I will do it!\u201d Wen-Ren Chu-Chu gritted her teeth. Her voice was shaking, but she had already made up her mind. She raised her head and her cold and fierce eyes locked on Ye Xiao\u2019s face as she spoke, \u201cBrother Feng, if you are telling the truth, we will certainly follow the agreement; I won\u2019t make any trouble for you\u2026 I will treat you like a forefather\u2026 But\u2026\u201dShe gnashed with her teeth, \u201cBut if you lie to me\u2026 and intentionally take advantage of me, Feng Zhi-Ling, you should know there are situations in the world that can only be described as\u2026 \u2018begging for death\u2019!\u201dHer voice sounded terrifying and scary.Ye Xiao felt displeased and said coldly, \u201cYou don\u2019t think that I would risk my life just to touch your belly, do you? Who do you think you are?\u201dWhen speaking, he squinted at her face and murmured, \u201cYou really do think you\u2019re a world-class beauty. Just how good do you feel about yourself\u2026\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu was so angry that her chest rose and fell continuously and she started clenching her teeth unconsciously. She stared at Ye Xiao fiercely with eyes burning with hatred.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d Ye Xiao shouted, \u201cDo you want to do it or not? Make your call!\u201d\u201c\u2026Do it!\u201d Wen-Ren Chu-Chu spoke and the words through her clenched teeth.\u201cSo you want to get cured. Then prepare for it will you?\u201d Ye Xiao said impatiently, \u201cTell your men to guard outside the door. Close all the windows. Make it private. What are you waiting for?\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu was standing there not moving an inch, as if her feet were nailed to the floor.\u201cWhat are you thinking about? Hurry up and make the arrangements, will you?\u201d Ye Xiao asked and felt strange, \u201cGet back in here after you are done with the preparations. Let\u2019s get started quickly. The sooner we start, the sooner it ends\u2026 Why are you still standing here?\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu gritted her teeth and took a deep breath. She then abruptly rushed out of the room.After a while, the voice of the guards came along saying that the whole property will be locked down right away.\u201cAll paths 150 meters around the property will be blocked. Nobody is allowed to get close. Whoever gets close will be killed right away!\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu finished the preparations and waited for a while before she walked back into the room with her head lowered and her body shaking.\u201cIs it all done?\u201d Ye Xiao asked.\u201cDone.\u201d Wen-Ren Chu-Chu spoke with a quivering voice.\u201cLet\u2019s get started. What are you waiting for?\u201d Ye Xiao squinted his eyes and said, \u201cTake it off!\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu\u2019s body quivered and her face turned pale. Her eyes were similar to that of a helpless deer while looking at Ye Xiao, making her look even more vulnerable.Ye Xiao tidied up the bed and turned around. He saw her still standing there, so he frowned, \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you? Do you want to get cured or not? Take off your clothes if you want\u2026 You are fine with wasting time here, but I\u2019ve been missing for over a day now\u2026 My family must be worried. I have to get back as soon as possible. Let me finish curing you quickly so I can go back. Gosh\u2026 Why are you so sentimental\u2026 You looked like a decisive person. What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu was much stronger than the guy standing in front of her. However, she felt like a sacrificial lamb, filled with fear and helplessness.Until now, whether she was at home or at the sect, she had never had any sort of contact with men. Even her little hands had never been touched by anyone else.It was unexpected that during her journey in the Kingdom of Chen, her hands would be touched a lot, and now, even her naked body needed to be seen and touched! The worst thing was that she had to willingly take off her clothes herself.The man involved was actually a stranger who she had met the day before.Such a terrible experience had nearly made her pass out!She raised her pretty hands slowly and quiveringly, and reached to her waist, but she was not brave enough to take off the sash\u2026Ye Xiao frowned. He was really weary of this now.\u2018I really don\u2019t understand why girls are so troublesome, and why she spends so long just to take off some clothes. For all I know, it only takes a second, right? Just get it done already\u2026 You can waste as much time as you want, but I can\u2019t afford to waste any!\u2019He couldn\u2019t help saying aloud, \u201cCan\u2019t you just do it like I do \u2013 Shoot! \u2013 and be done instantly\u2026 It is just taking off some clothes\u2026 You do it every night before you sleep, don\u2019t you? Is it really that hard for you?\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu felt ashamed and angry. She replied with rage, \u201cI am a girl!\u201d\u201cOf course you are a girl. I know it and you don\u2019t need to emphasize it. A guy would never dilly dally like you do. But, don\u2019t girls take off their clothes?\u201d Ye Xiao squinted and said disdainfully, \u201cThe only thing you need to do to save your life is to simply take your clothes off. I don\u2019t understand why you dilly dally like this? Are you alright? Are your clothes so complex that you can\u2019t remove them on your own? If so, you should let me know so that I can help you with it!\u201d\u2018You want to help me with it?\u2019Wen-Ren Chu-Chu fiercely gritted her teeth.Facing such a unromantic fool who knew absolutely nothing about a girl\u2019s mind, she really didn\u2019t know what to say. This guy didn\u2019t know anything about a girl\u2019s shyness at all.\u2018Do you really think it is about whether I know how to take off my clothes or not? It is about whether I can or cannot, okay?!\u2019\u201cI really can\u2019t imagine what kind of surroundings he grew up in. What a weirdo!\u201d Wen-Ren Chu-Chu felt confused.If she knew that Ye Xiao was currently living his second life and he used to have such a prominent figure in his previous life, she would definitely be baffled.However, Ye Xiao had been a virgin in his previous life because of the martial art he had been cultivating. He would always run far away from the girls as fast as he could.He would never try to get close to any girl. It would be a severe problem if he got involved with a girl\u2026That\u2019s why he ended up as a well-informed and experienced man, who knew nothing about things between men and women\u2026\u201cYou\u2026 Turn around first.\u201d Wen-Ren Chu-Chu blushed.\u201cYou are so troublesome\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao sighed. He didn\u2019t talk much though. Instead, he simply turned around.The sound of rustling clothes could be heard behind him. After a while, it finally turned silent.Another while passed but he still did not hear a single sound from her. Ye Xiao frowned and spoke impatiently again, \u201cAre you done? Can you do it or not?!\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu almost wanted to kick him to death, but instead she spoke with a quiver, \u201cAll right. Give your\u2026 Give me your hand\u2026\u201d\u2018Women are so troublesome!\u2019 \u2014 Ye Xiao sighed. Standing with his back facing her, he reached behind him and extended his hand towards her.As soon as he did, He felt his hand being guided by a smaller hand. That hand was trembling, almost to the extent that it couldn\u2019t keep its hold on Ye Xiao\u2019s hand.After a while, he could feel a sense of warmth slowly getting nearer. Perhaps his hand was approaching a warm object.The next moment, he felt his hand land on a warm, smooth and jade-like skin.The warmth he felt from his hand was truly fantastic!At this moment, Ye Xiao even felt his soul quivering. It was an indescribably marvelous feeling.He felt some desire originating inside him. He wanted to keep his hand on that place forever and never move. He felt as though his body had become incredibly light and that he was floating on air.The next moment, apart from the marvelous softness, he felt a scent of a girl\u2019s body entering his nose. All of a sudden, he felt lost and intoxicated; it was as if he was dreaming.Behind him, the body he was touching was shaking. Wen-Ren Chu-Chu spoke with a shaky voice, \u201cYou\u2026 You\u2026 Why don\u2019t you begin\u2026\u201dYe Xiao seemed to suddenly wake up from his stupor and felt astonished. He murmured, \u201cYou siren, how dare you distract my mind. I am going to operate my martial art against you!\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu had been so terrified that her body was quivering. It was the natural fear of a virgin girl when she was naked in front of a male, not that she was weak.However she found that Ye Xiao was quivering too. He looked even more terrified than she did\u2026 She found it to be really funny: \u2018It is natural that I, as a girl, feel fear facing a guy. What do you fear in spite of being a man? Do you think there is anything I can do to you? I am in such a situation, what can I do?\u2019Especially when she heard the words \u2018You siren, how dare you distract me\u2019, she couldn\u2019t help laughing out loud. \u2018It seems\u2026 this Master Feng is not playing a fool; he really knows nothing.\u2019She said, \u201cWhat are you murmuring about. Stop the nonsense and get started quickly!\u201dAs soon as she finished speaking, she felt a stream of scorching power originating from Master Feng\u2019s palm. The power, which was irresistible and enormous, suddenly flow into her dantian!Such a huge stream of power was something even Wen-Ren Chu-Chu, who was the best disciple of the top-classed sect of the Qing-Yun Realm and knew almost every martial art in the world, was totally unacquainted with!This unheard-of strange power was like a flame which could even burn the souls!\u2018This is the Purple Sky-fire, isn\u2019t it?\u2019This supernatural thing is truly unheard of!Such\u2026 A comfortable feeling!She had expected to feel a tremendous amount of pain, comparable to being burned in scorching flames, but she didn\u2019t feel any pain at all. Instead, she felt an extremely comfortable feeling spread throughout her body.It was the feeling of comfort coming from the depths of her soul. Even though Wen-Ren Chu-Chu was usually steady and calm, the extremely pleasant sensation made her unable to control herself and a moan unintentionally leaked out.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAhh~~~\u201dYe Xiao heard it and quivered. He shouted angrily, \u201cVixen! Don\u2019t ever make such seductive sound again\u2026\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu was so ashamed that her body turned hot because of the moan she had made after losing control. When she heard Ye Xiao\u2019s seductive words, she suddenly felt that it was fine to do that. She actually did something she would never have dreamt of: she spoke with an insinuating voice, \u201cIs this the Purple Sky-fire? Oh it\u2019s so amazing!\u201dYe Xiao was shocked by the extremely soft voice, as he quivered. He said angrily, \u201cDon\u2019t speak like that!\u201dA virgin throughout both lives, what a poor thing! When did he ever experience such a soft and sweet situation? It was the first time for him in his two lives. He suddenly felt choked up with emotions. He panicked and his hands and feet scrambled to keep up with his messy thoughts, but he managed to keep operating his qi\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 57 \u2013 A Silly Young Man\u2019s TherapyDuring his two lives, he had not even held a girl\u2019s arms, yet this time, he had skipped that part and had jumped straight to touching a girl\u2019s belly\u2026How had things ended up this way? The feeling on his hand was extremely pleasant\u2026 He was feeling the warmth, the smoothness, the breathing, and the pulsing Jing and Mai of a girl\u2019s body\u2026Ye Xiao was totally flustered at this moment. Did it mean that that the treatment he had proposed was akin to lifting a stone and smashing it on his own toes?!He forcibly kept operating his martial arts and used the intense heat of the East-rising Purple Qi to absorb the cold qi in Wen-Ren Chu-Chu\u2019s body as her martial arts continued to operate.The East-rising Purple Qi was indeed an extraordinary martial art which belonged in the legends. It had already started to take effect. As he continued to operate the qi, he felt a string of the cold qi gather in his palm. He became encouraged by this and decided to speed up the pace of his operation. As for now, his mind was clear and he could finally concentrate.The two of them were bonded by their bodies and their spirits were connected. They surely knew about each other\u2019s condition. Wen-Ren Chu-Chu was able to notice all the changes happening inside Ye Xiao. He sat still, but the heat continuously entered her body. She felt more and more comfortable, it was as if she was bathing in a hot spring. She just wanted to fall asleep that way.But, she didn\u2019t dare show any carelessness.She had come to know the astounding effect of Ye Xiao\u2019s martial art. She operated her spiritual consciousness and was surprised to discover that the rooted cyan streams of cold qi, which represented her death, were being dispelled bit by bit inside her dantian. As the shadow of death that had been hovering inside her head gradually disappeared, she suddenly experienced a feeling of elation.It was not entirely because of the disappearing shade of death or the possiblity of a clear path of cultivation in her future that made her feel happy.It was because\u2026 this guy was curing her with all his heart which made her actually feel \u2018a sense of belonging\u2019. It was a feeling that she had never felt before; unfamiliar, yet enjoyable\u2026She sighed in her mind and stopped the vision of her spiritual consciousness. She slightly turned her head and quietly gazed at the side of Ye Xiao\u2019s face.[This guy is not really that good-looking\u2026 and he is a bit old\u2026 but he looks so charming when he is working seriously.And he gives me a sense of safety which extends to the bottom of my heart.And\u2026 a few moments before, when he was panicking and didn\u2019t know what to do\u2026 he looked so cute\u2026He must be a guy who has experienced everything except for relations between a man and woman!Even if he is cunning enough to rule the whole world, when he faces a girl, he is only a silly young man\u2026]While thinking of that, she felt something soft arise in her heart.She looked at Ye Xiao\u2019s motionless face and she actually got lost in thought.Initially, if the therapy had really worked, she had planned for him to acquire the Regeneration Jade Lotus to cure her master and kill him afterwards, since he had disgraced her.It seemed ungrateful to do so, but she didn\u2019t have a choice in order to protect her own reputation!However, now that she was gazing at his face, she understood one thing: [Even if that day comes, I probably couldn\u2019t do it.]She realized that\u2026 the gap between them was huge\u2026[Although he is a supreme dan-maker, he is a dan-maker of the mortal world; he is a man of the martial world.And for me, after solving the problems of father and master, I have to go back after all\u2026Even if I were not the inheritor of an elite sect of the Qing-Yun Realm, I\u2026 am the princess of a kingdom after all\u2026 How can I\u2026]Thinking of that, she felt sad and couldn\u2019t help sighing.If Ye Xiao turned around, he would have discovered that the girl was now wearing a weird expression. He would have also notice that the girl was actually fully dressed.She had only cut a circular hole on the part of her clothes covering her dantian and only a small part of her belly was exposed.However, that was the furthest she was willing to go\u2026 She was a virgin after all. It was not easy for her to reveal the skin of her belly even in such circumstances.It could be summarised as such: If she hadn\u2019t been so eager to cure her dying master and to test the feasibility of Ye Xiao\u2019s solution, she wouldn\u2019t have let any guy touch her body, even if she were to die!In fact, at the beginning, she was still really hesitant.However, after feeling the Purple Sky-fire warm her body and comfort her mind, she felt happy, and this happiness brought along both fear and confusion at the same time\u2026Time passed slowly, bit by bit\u2026Wen-Ren Chu-Chu was a perceptive girl. She clearly felt that her energy was getting purer and purer as the impact of the cold qi was dispersing bit by bit. The breath of the man became heavier at the same time.He was obviously tired\u2026[In such position, reaching his hand behind his back to my belly, he keeps operating his martial art for such a long time with no breaks. How could he not be tired?]Thinking about that, Wen-Ren Chu-Chu moved her body quietly so as to make Ye Xiao operate in a position that wouldn\u2019t be that difficult for him\u2026She even showed a shy smile on the corners of her mouth.[Nerd\u2026 He probably thinks that I am an ugly girl. Humph\u2026 If I reveal my true face, I promise you will be enchanted immediately, nerd!But\u2026 Can I show him\u2026 my true face?]While collecting her thoughts, Wen-Ren Chu-Chu felt shy for a moment, perplexed for a moment, sad for a moment, helpless for a moment, and like she was in a dream for a moment\u2026She was a girl who had learnt battle tactics her entire life; she started cultivating when she was about five and she learned to command the army when she was about seven; when she turned thirteen, she had adventured in the Qing-Yun Realm\u2026This kind of emotion was something she never had experienced before.Neither she nor Ye Xiao, whose EQ was zero, knew that it was something every young girl would eventually experience. There was no woman who had not.Later, after Ye Xiao confirmed for the third time that the cold qi inside Wen-Ren Chu-Chu\u2019s body had been completely eradicated and nothing remained in her dantian that he could draw out, he finally stopped the operation.Before he opened his eyes, he heard Wen-Ren Chu-Chu\u2019s voice, \u201cIs it done?\u201dThey had been spiritually connected during the therapy, so he wasn\u2019t surprised that she could notice all of his movements. But what surprised him the most was the tone of her voice. It was unprecedentedly soft and gentle. It was a different kind of gentle, something unlike the one she used in the earlier conversation. The earlier one was on purpose while the present one was from the bottom of her heart.Ye Xiao nodded and said, \u201cDone.\u201dAnd then the bed shook; Wen-Ren Chu-Chu had already left. Ye Xiao composed himself before turning around. He could still feel the heat that remained in his hand, leaving behind an aftertaste.He saw her standing in front of the window, tidying up her clothes.Her cyan robe, as well as her hair was being buffeted by the wind. Her tall and slim body looked especially attractive under the lights of the setting sun.\u201cThis woman is slow in taking off clothes, but fast in putting them back on.\u201d Ye Xiao murmured in mind.The silly man didn\u2019t know that the girl had never undressed at all.At the moment, she had merely put on a robe and had covered everything with it.\u201cBrother Feng, I now believe that you really have the capability.\u201d Wen-Ren Chu-Chu looked outside of the window and spoke gently, \u201cBut\u2026 I wonder if you will come with me to the Kingdom of Lan-Feng to cure my master?\u201d\u201cAbsolutely not. We have a deal. I helped you with your illness and proved my capability. You shouldn\u2019t interfere with my freedom.\u201d Ye Xiao answered decisively, \u201cHowever, I could cure your master. But first, she needs to come to the Kingdom of Chen.\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu sighed.She didn\u2019t even try to force his hand.That was surprising for Ye Xiao.In Ye Xiao\u2019s mind, even though he had helped her with her problem, she might still decide to not keep her promise about setting him free. She should have at least bargained with him. He had spoken decisively because he was trying to take the initiative for the inevitable bargain which was to follow. However, he was left surprised that the girl had actually allowed him to leave without any conditions!\u201cJust\u2026 The Regeneration Ink Lotus\u2026 How do I raise it? Is it really possible to turned it into the Regeneration Jade Lotus in a short time?\u201d Wen-Ren Chu-Chu asked.Ye Xiao could barely believe his ears. [Is she still the forceful Wen-Ren Chu-Chu? The question is an interrogative sentence, but why does it sound so soft?]\u201cI have solved your problem just now. Isn\u2019t it the best proof of my capability? If you can trust me, give me the lotus.\u201d Ye Xiao spoke without mincing his words, \u201cIn your hands, to be honest, it will be a waste. Such an item can only be effective in the hands of someone great like me! Only I can unlock its true potential!\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu didn\u2019t turn around; she nodded slowly instead.\u201cThen when I come back next time, how do I find you? Should we establish a means of communication?\u201d She asked with a low voice.\u201cThere is no need to bother. When you come, you will find me for sure.\u201d Ye Xiao said, \u201cI believe that even if I hide, you will have your own way of finding me.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWen-Ren Chu-Chu nodded again.That was right. In the world, there were not many people that could escape from the surveillance of Wen-Ren Chu-Chu.As of now, Wen-Ren Chu-Chu could clearly feel that the qi inside her body was flowing at an unprecedentedly active condition. She even had a feeling that she could enter the highest grade in this world \u2013 the Grade of Tianyuan any time she wanted!In fact, she felt that she could do more. Perhaps, she only needed one third of the time she had estimated to reach the Grandmaster levels of Tianyuan!It was something she had been dreaming about. She had gained such an advantage now and she was closer to her dream, but she actually didn\u2019t feel much pleasure; instead, she was filled with an indescribable disconsolation\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Beat Him Up![The faster I improve, the sooner I can leave this world\u2026]Ye Xiao was also keeping an eye on his own condition. He had been continuously using his power, so he must have consumed a lot of it. If that\u2019s the case, then why was it that he didn\u2019t feel tired at all? On the contrary, he felt like he was in a pretty good shape. He used his spiritual consciousness to check his own spiritual space and was surprised to discover that inside the Yin Space of the nine Spaces which was previously empty, there now existed some cyan fog!The cold qi, which had been dispelled from the girl\u2019s body, was actually not banished by the East-rising Purple Qi; it had been absorbed by the Spaces\u2026 In other words, the cold qi was actually the kind of energy that the Yin Space needed!At this moment, Ye Xiao was incomparably astonished and overjoyed!He had been thinking that his treatment would be some kind of thankless task which would consume a lot of energy. He had never imagined that he would have acquired such a big reward!If not for this coincidence, it would have been quite difficult for him to find out what this Yin qi was.After realizing this, Ye Xiao suddenly became filled with expectations about curing Wen-Ren Chu-Chu\u2019s master. Since she was the master of this girl, her cultivation must be of a much higher grade\u2026 To put it simply, Ye Xiao could gain much more Yin qi than the amount he had gained from Wen-Ren Chu-Chu.When he thought about that, Ye Xiao immediately told her, \u201cIf you can\u2019t find me when you come here again, you can go to the Northern General\u2019s House. You will know how to contact me when you get there\u2026\u201dIn order to get more Yin qi, Ye Xiao had to make it more convenient for her; of course, it was this convenience that brought many complications.Wen-Ren Chu-Chu smiled gently, \u201cYou do have connections with them. During the auction, you had been acting against the Mu Clan the whole time. I guessed that you might be related to the Ye Clan\u2026 I was right.\u201dYe Xiao said gloomily, \u201cIt is not a good thing for a girl to be too smart\u2026\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu heard him and actually sighed. She spoke softly, \u201cDo you think I want to be this smart and concerned about everything\u2026 I want somebody to be the smart one for me\u2026\u201dThey were both quiet for a long time.Ye Xiao was sitting on the bedside while Wen-Ren Chu-Chu was standing in front of window. As she gazed out of the window, Ye Xiao looked at her back.\u201cSorry for offending you this time.\u201d Wen-Ren Chu-Chu spoke in a sombre voice, \u201cI was planning to invite you to the Kingdom of Lan-Feng because I admire your skill in dan-making\u2026 I never thought that I would be the one to owe you such a big favor.\u201dSlowly, Wen-Ren Chu-Chu\u2019s voice regained its initial tranquility.Ye Xiao didn\u2019t talk.\u201cBut it is fortunate that I came up with such a plan\u2026 Otherwise, I don\u2019t know how long we would have needed to struggle before we can find a way to dispel the cold qi\u2026 This was such a lucky coincidence.\u201d Wen-Ren Chu-Chu spoke again with a half-smile.\u201cOne does what one must. You don\u2019t have to keep it in mind.\u201d Ye Xiao spoke indifferently.\u201cFeng Zhi-Ling\u2026\u201d Wen-Ren Chu-Chu said embarrassedly, \u201cWhen my master comes to you for the treatment, will it also have to be like this\u2026 to proceed with her skin being touched?\u201dYe Xiao was highly perceptive and noticed something strange in her words, but he didn\u2019t think too much about it. He would never guess what she was thinking anyway. He said, \u201cYes. The reason why we have to do it this way is probably because my cultivation is not good enough to operate the Purple Sky-fire outside my body. I have to touch your skin to connect my qi to yours\u2026 To reach the level where I can operate the Purple Sky-fire outside my body, I need to at least reach the Grandmaster levels of Tianyuan, which would allow me to fly up to the Qing-Yun Realm.\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu\u2019s slim body shook suddenly as she cried, \u201cYou\u2026 You are actually planning to abandon this land and fly to the Qing-Yun Realm?\u201dYe Xiao didn\u2019t understand the reason for her sudden agitation. He said with astonishment, \u201cDo you mean that I cannot break the limit of this world and progress to the higher realm?\u201d\u201cHmmm, no\u2026 I didn\u2019t mean that. It was just too\u2026\u201d Wen-Ren Chu-Chu became embarrassed and the blush on her face once again reached her neck. Her voice became as soft as the buzzing of mosquitos. Even though Ye Xiao had ultra-sensitive hearing, he still couldn\u2019t clearly hear the last two words that she had spoken.\u201cBrother Feng\u2026 Since you have completed your part of our agreement, I shall keep my promise and set you free.\u201d Her voice contained a sense of melancholy and depression.Ye Xiao frowned and thought: [That tone of hers\u2026Could it be that she regrets making the agreement? Does she want to catch me once more after letting me off?]\u201cDon\u2019t worry, my words carry no other meaning. It is just that\u2026 after you leave, I have to give up the former plan and go back to my kingdom straight away.\u201d Wen-Ren Chu-Chu spoke in a low voice, \u201cIn three months, I will come back here with my master. I hope that you will give us a surprise at that time.\u201d\u201cHm, I see. I also look forward to the day we meet again.\u201d Ye Xiao said.When she heard those words being spoken so indifferently, without even a trace of expectation, Wen-Ren Chu-Chu couldn\u2019t help but bite her lower lip.[Asshole!]\u201cDo\u2026 you want to see my true face?\u201d In a fit of irritation, she asked this question. She didn\u2019t even know why she did so; it had just come out of her mouth.Maybe she was simply dissatisfied with his reaction?Or maybe she did not resign herself to be considered ugly by Ye Xiao?Ye Xiao shook his head, \u201cThere is no point in seeing your face\u2026 No, thanks.\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu\u2019s slim body shook as a desolate smile appeared on her face. She murmured, \u201cThat\u2019s right, what\u2019s the point of him seeing my true face?\u201dShe stood by the window quietly for another long time.And when she finally turned around, her expression was ice cold.She spoke blandly, \u201cSince we have made an agreement already, Brother Feng, let me walk you out.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re letting me go just like this?\u201d Ye Xiao actually felt a bit surprised.[That is surprising, isn\u2019t it? Is she not afraid that I\u2019ll go back on my words or try to hide from them? Does she really not want to use any special technique to set an unbreakable block on me or something\u2026]\u201cWhy don\u2019t you leave already? Do you want to live here?\u201d Wen-Ren Chu-Chu suddenly became angry and spoke fiercely, deviating from her normal behavior.Ye Xiao was more confused and felt that this girl was too susceptible to mood swings. He couldn\u2019t help but sigh in his mind as he thought: [Girls are really incomprehensible creatures after all. No matter what, I have just solved a big problem for her\u2026And now, she suddenly became unfriendly.There\u2019s a good saying describing this: In this world, women are the most difficult to understand!]He sighed internally again and followed Wen-Ren Chu-Chu out.When they arrived at the door, Wen-Ren Chu-Chu stopped and took out a jade box from her clothes. She passed it to Ye Xiao and spoke expressionlessly, \u201cHere is the Regeneration Ink Lotus.\u201d\u201cOk.\u201d Ye Xiao took it immediately and held it in his hand. His eyes glanced around; he looked eager to leave.Wen-Ren Chu-Chu gritted her teeth again.[Asshole. You could at least fake it\u2026 Couldn\u2019t you just pretend that you are a little reluctant to leave? I have been taking care of you all day and I have even been touched by you. Do you really need to leave so desperately?]She then gritted her teeth and said, \u201cFeng Zhi-Ling, you better remember this. It is a big gamble for me to give you the Regeneration Ink Lotus! If you ever lose it or ruin it\u2026 I will\u2026 I\u2019ll\u2026 I will rip your skin off bit by bit!\u201dYe Xiao shook his head and laughed, \u201cLady Chu-Chu, if you keep being so violent\u2026 who would want to marry you in the future?\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu was still angry but then she blushed again.\u201cJust leave.\u201d She said.A breeze blew past, blowing her robes in the air. Her long hair that was ruffled by the breeze was also floating. Her slim and tall body seemed like it would fly away with the wind at any moment.But her eyes were filled with a sense of solitude and loneliness.\u201cGood bye.\u201d Ye Xiao wouldn\u2019t dare to stay longer, would he? As he was allowed to leave, he left without any hesitation.\u201cHold on!\u201d Watching him leave so quickly, Wen-Ren Chu-Chu gritted her teeth. She felt that she was going to freak out because of this unromantic man.\u201cWhat?! Is there a problem?\u201d Ye Xiao turned around speechlessly.\u201cJust one more question.\u201d Wen-Ren Chu-Chu took a deep breath and said, \u201cFeng Zhi-Ling\u2026 Your face\u2026 Is this your true face?\u201dShe didn\u2019t want to ask this question and hadn\u2019t planned it. She told Ye Xiao to hold on because she was still slightly angry, that was all.However, when Ye Xiao turned around, she had nothing to say, so she tried to come up with something. Then she suddenly got an idea: [My face is disguised; could he be disguised too?]After all, that was just her trying to think of a topic.Ye Xiao stayed silent for a while before asking her, \u201cLady Chu-Chu, is your present face your true face?\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu wouldn\u2019t have even dreamt about receiving such an answer. She was shocked and replied, \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThink about it Lady Chu-Chu; the same applies to me. We both have a tacit understanding.\u201d Ye Xiao laughed, threw up his hands and shrugged his shoulders.Wen-Ren Chu-Chu\u2019s slim body shook a little and she murmured, \u201cIt turns out you are not showing your true face either.\u201dShe suddenly became enraged.She had been taken advantaged of and had gotten nothing in return; only at the end did she realize that she hadn\u2019t even seen his true face!She got angrier the more she thought about it. Suddenly, she spoke in an ear-piercing voice, \u201cYou actually lied to me!\u201dYe Xiao was astonished, \u201cI lied to you? Never. What did I lie about?\u201dWen-Ren Chu-Chu dashed over with a furious look on her face and started to beat him up frantically. She gritted her teeth while punching him, \u201cFeng Zhi-Ling, how dare you lie to me! Feng Zhi-Ling, you lied to me\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHer punches were getting stronger. It seemed like she was trying to release all the grievances in her heart. This girl\u2019s temper, as well as her feelings, were all contained in her punches.Since she was at the Level 9 of the Grade of Diyuan and Ye Xiao was only Level 1 of the same grade, she could naturally beat him up however she wanted. She was really doing it with ease and enthusiasm. Ye Xiao couldn\u2019t do anything to defend against her and he was dumbstruck by the sudden attack.Unwittingly, before he realized what was going on, he had been struck by the storm-like punches more than a dozen times.Ye Xiao was totally speechless over this injustice!He felt that he had been completely wronged.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He tried to dodge the attacks while attempting to understand the situation before shouting out in anger, \u201cYou, you, you\u2026Didn\u2019t you show me a disguised face too? You, you, you\u2026 Just how did I lie to you? What did I lie to you about? You woman, you mad woman\u2026 You\u2019re really unreasonable!\u201dAs he was violently thrashed by such an overwhelming force, Ye Xiao naturally felt humiliated to the extreme.It was his first time being beaten up in both his current and previous life.[I actually got beaten up by a woman!This is too embarrassing!This woman is so unreasonable\u2026 Way too unreasonable\u2026]At this moment, Ye Xiao\u2019s mind was filled with these kind of thoughts to the extent that he became incapable of thinking about anything else!With this thrashing, Wen-Ren Chu-Chu was beating him to her heart\u2019s content. As she hit him, she spoke furiously, \u201cI told you that you were an idiot, yet you didn\u2019t believe me. You dare to try reason with a woman? You deserve to be beaten up\u2026!\u201d Towards the end of her tirade, there emerged a trace of humour in her voice.Hearing her words, Ye Xiao suddenly became dispirited.[Shit! I am such a fool!I actually tried to argue with a woman\u2026I am getting beaten up for absolutely no reason at all\u2026]Wen-Ren Chu-Chu was getting more and more vigorous while beating him. After she felt that she had vented enough of her anger, she jumped up with a graceful spin and floated casually through the doorway. Only a playful voice resounded from within, \u201cBrother Feng, I will come back in three months\u2026\u201d\u2013 BANG! \u2013The door was shut firmly.Ye Xiao was standing in front of the door with a runny nose and a swollen face. He wanted to cry but could not shed tears. Right now, he was simply speechless!As he felt angry and ashamed, he furiously shouted, \u201cNo matter how much you try, you will never be able to find me! You mad woman!\u201dYet he only heard a fully satisfied and vigorous laughter from inside the property which was then followed by utter silence.He suppressed his anger which nearly made him spit out blood. He then turned around and left while murmuring, \u201cWomen are so unreasonable\u2026\u201dHis figure was moving further and further away.He hadn\u2019t noticed that the door had been ajar.Half of Wen-Ren Chu-Chu\u2019s face was shown through the crack and she watched Ye Xiao leaving with angry strides. When she heard his murmuring, she couldn\u2019t help laughing out loud as she muttered, \u201cSuch a fool\u2026\u201dWhen she turned around, she found two people looking at her at the moment.\u201cMy lady\u2026\u201d The middle-aged woman looked at her questioningly.Wen-Ren Chu-Chu\u2019s face turned hot for a second before returning back to normal. She spoke indifferently, \u201cStart packing. We need to leave as soon as possible. We\u2019re going home!\u201dShe said nothing else and elegantly walked back to her room.She looked at the bed on which Ye Xiao had sat before and thought about how he had operated his martial arts on her \u2013 and how those big warm hands had pressed her belly. She couldn\u2019t help but shudder as heat coursed through her body. She gently sat down, her jade hands slowly stroking the spot where Ye Xiao sat a while ago, vaguely feeling the heat of his body which had continued to linger.Her eyes were getting desolate and hazy as she murmured, \u201cMy sworn enemy\u2026 You are really my sworn enemy\u2026\u201d[TL note: Sworn enemy (\u51a4\u5bb6) in Chinese can also refer to one\u2019s destined love.]After leaving Wen-Ren Chu-Chu\u2019s secret hideout, Ye Xiao made a few winding detours. Only when he was certain that no one was following him did he throw the Regeneration Ink Lotus into the Space.He was preparing to throw away the box like he always did, but he suddenly found something else inside the box. He opened it and discovered a delicate, small handkerchief. There were some cloud like patterns faintly embroidered on it; they looked illusory and a faint lotus was laid at its center, .If some ordinary person saw this, he wouldn\u2019t feel anything special about it. However, Ye Xiao knew a lot about such flowers. He knew the story behind this lotus.This lotus grows in the valleys that are perennially covered by mist. Its name was the Mist Lotus.This lotus looked illusory and gave an impression of some faint beauty of fairylands. However, it was extremely poisonous. The mist lotus could make people fall into coma and turn into a skeleton in a short amount of time. It was truly overbearing.It looked soft, pretty and elegant, but it was extremely poisonous. It reminded Ye Xiao of the crazy girl, Wen-Ren Chu-Chu.[The girl also looks soft and pretty, but in fact, she is vicious and decisive. If she revealed her true face, she would be a world-class beauty.]Her situation could be compared to the lotus.On the border of the handkerchief, a faint line of delicate script could be seen.\u201c\u96fe\u91cc\u770b\u82b1\u7f8e, \u98ce\u4e2d\u821e\u5929\u6c89; \u5bf9\u654c\u4f5c\u7f57\u5239, \u4f8d\u541b\u662f\u7f8e\u4eba.\u201d(The flower is beautiful when seen through the mist; the heavens sink when she dances in the wind. A demon to the enemy; A beauty to the one she serves.)Ye Xiao was deep in thought as he held the handkerchief, and then he shook his head and smiled, \u201cA woman like you\u2026 You think you are a beauty, really\u2026\u201dIf Lady Wen-Ren Chu-Chu was here and heard what he had just said with such confidence, he would definitely be beaten up again. In fact, he would receive a beating much fiercer than the one he had just experienced. A girl had already put a handkerchief in the box for him, yet he didn\u2019t understand her intent and even slandered the girl while talking to himself.It would have been an act of mercy to just keep him alive.It had to be said that this guy\u2019s EQ could actually be so low; this was truly inconceivable!After slandering the girl, he casually played with the small handkerchief and suddenly thought of something. He felt like the sense of the softness and smoothness were still on his fingers. He kneaded his fingers like he could still feel the touch of her belly and murmured, \u201cThat belly is beautiful somehow\u2026 It felt pretty good when touching it.\u201dHe then put the handkerchief into his coat and smelled a faint fragrance. It made him feel like Wen-Ren Chu-Chu was still around him\u2026[Did that chick keep a Mist Lotus in her sleeve all along? I didn\u2019t even notice\u2026]\u201cHow pathetic, I was totally beaten up by that mad woman\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao spoke bitterly, \u201cI will remember this. When I have the chance to hit her back, I must beat her till her ass is broken!\u201dHe imagined the scene where he was spanking the girl\u2019s buttocks until she cried and begged for mercy. That made him felt delighted.With a imaginary victory, he held his head high and headed back home.He had walked for a long distance and would arrive home after travelling a few more blocks. Suddenly, he frowned\u2026The wind was blowing from the direction to his house.It seemed there were people coming over rapidly. Ye Xiao felt motivated and went forward.The first person approached him like a whirlwind, moving at the speed of lightning, but his entire body was splattered with blood. By the time he saw Ye Xiao, he was already within ten meters of him. Suddenly, his body twisted as he said a low voice, \u201cMove aside unless you want to die!\u201dFollowing that, he flashed past Ye Xiao, barely making contact with his body.Even though he was so busy moving, he actually had pushed Ye Xiao towards the wall.Although that person had barely brushed him, Ye Xiao felt an enormous force strike him. With a whoosh, his body had flew to the corner of the street.He was extremely frightened.[This guy must have reached a marvelous level of cultivation. Why is he wounded so badly?]Just when he thought about this, he saw three figures flying towards him. Blades that gleamed like reckless lightning whistled past the location where he had just been standing.Obviously, if he hadn\u2019t been pushed by the man who was being hunted, these three sword lights would definitely have hit him directly. The three fellows didn\u2019t look like they would allow anyone to escape\u2026If there was someone who was a bit weaker standing in his place, he would certainly be ripped to shreds by these sword lights!Ye Xiao was furious![Since this is the case, why don\u2019t I return the compliment.]The sword lights had just missed Ye Xiao, and he heard one of the three guys say, \u201cThere is an ant over here\u2026\u201d\u201cNo need to mention it!\u201d Another guy replied with a deep voice.The following moment, three gleaming sword lights suddenly circled in the air and shot toward Ye Xiao\u2019s neck.\u201cHe has seen the light of our blades and knows that we are hunting. We can\u2019t let him live.\u201d\u201cJust kill him!\u201dThe sword lights rapidly approached him.The three of them didn\u2019t even turn around to look at him.The three gleaming sword lights instantly reached the corner of the alleyway and changed directions to pursue Ye Xiao.To them, it didn\u2019t matter whether Ye Xiao lived or died. These three people had completely disregarded him. The only reason they wanted to kill him was because they had seen him during this chase!Ye Xiao was extremely furious. He turned his head and dodged to the side. The three sword lights embedded themselves deeply into the wall. At the same time, Ye Xiao shook his wrist and three cold lights appeared in his hand. With a swish, the three lights flew out.It was the gelid power.The energy that didn\u2019t belong to this world had shown up for the first time!It instantly froze the moisture in the air, converting it into ice; three exquisite small knives were formed and thrown.The cold lights flew outwards. Ye Xiao didn\u2019t look towards his targets either. He turned around and operated the Lunisolar Shadow. \u2013 POOF! \u2013 He disappeared.The three guys had already gotten out of the alley and were about to move out of sight.But all of a sudden, an extreme crisis descended upon them.The three of them were astonished at the same time.They looked back and only saw the three lights that had already reached them.When they turned around the corner, the lights had also turned around and chased after them!The two of them swung their swords. \u2013 BANG! \u2013 They blocked the ice knives when it was about to be lodged between their eyebrows. They felt a stream of coldness go into their brains through the middle of their eyebrows and they quivered.Looking at their longswords, they realised that their swords were already covered by a dense layer of frost! The hilt of their swords had become so cold that it felt like they were holding a ten-thousand-year old stalactite. They were chilled to the bone and they almost threw their longswords to the ground. They hurriedly executed a spiritual technique to forcefully suppress the gelid energy.A shocked shout echoed in the alleyway.The third guy was a bit slow with his sword. \u2013 KAK! \u2013 He chopped apart the knife but the edge of the knife had actually pierced his shoulder.Immediately after being hit, he lost all feelings in his shoulder. The next moment, he felt cold accumulate between his eyebrows and his entire arm became paralyzed because of the gelid power.\u2013 Pah! \u2013 His sword fell on the floor.His body became covered by ice at an astonishing speed!Even his beard, eyebrows, and hair were covered by ice!The knife had left a hole in his shoulder, but no blood came out from it. At this moment, even his veins had become frozen!He had turned into an ice sculpture.The three of them were totally scared out of their wits. They came to a halt at the same time, cold sweat drenched their bodies due to fear.In fact, considering their cultivation levels, they shouldn\u2019t have been this helpless. However, they had been focused on the powerful enemy who had been fleeing ahead of them\u2026They hadn\u2019t paid any attention on anything else.Unfortunately, they had encountered such a weirdly powerful enemy on the way. They didn\u2019t even have the time to react. By the time the attack arrived, it had already been too late to react.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWho was that?\u201d The three of them looked at each other with sweat dripping down their foreheads. Their hearts were pounding in fear.They couldn\u2019t believe that in this world, there was actually someone who was this strange and powerful!The third guy hurriedly operated the spiritual method in order to dispel the cold and his two fellow cultivators helped him with it. Finally, he recovered, but the shoulder was still wounded with frostbite.The muscles had turned blue.\u201cIt was\u2026 It was the guy who I tried to kill\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

At the same time, in his eyes, terror could be seen.When thinking about how he had tried to kill someone like that with just one sword move\u2026 and how it turned out to create such a trouble for himself, he felt that a snake was climbing on his back causing him to tremble.The three fellas were dumbstruck.The one who had been running away from them was already injured. He was so close to being caught, as he had become exhausted by the time he had crossed the corner of the alley. He was thinking: [I have spent my life running freely around the whole world. I was invincible! Yet I am going to die here today!]The next moment his eyes almost popped out.He too saw the three knives which shone like the stars in the night sky.He also saw the three guys who had been chasing him being hit at the same time, and noticed that they had actually lost their courage to continue the chase.The man\u2019s eyes lit up and he increased his pace in order to leave quickly.How lucky! He actually managed to keep his life intact!He thought of the man he had pushed aside just now. [Yes, it must be that guy.

Such a great favor, I will definitely repay him!I am Ning Bi-Luo and I am not the kind of person who doesn\u2019t have a sense of gratitude!][TL note: Ning Bi-Luo is this world\u2019s number 1 assassin, who had been mentioned in the previous chapters.]He suddenly moved and disappeared without a trace\u2026\u2026It hadn\u2019t been a long time \u2013 only two days had passed since Ye Xiao had left home. Generally, it wouldn\u2019t be considered as a case of disappearance at all.However, during this dangerous period, two days was a long time. After waiting for a \u2018long time\u2019, the steward was nearly driven crazy!A Storm was brewing in the capital. The streets were filled with fear, and everyone was suspicious of one another. Leaving home during this time was nothing but asking for death.Indeed there had been several events happening during these days \u2013 really strange events.It seemed like the Mu Clan had stopped planning their revenge toward Ye Clan. Before the world-shocking auction had even fully ended, every single man of the Mu Clan had already retreated from the capital. It was amazing how quickly they had ran off.It had left many people perplexed though.[What is going on with them?They aggressively arrived showing a wild bravado, but ceased all activities without doing anything? It looked like they were fugitives. What are they doing? Is it really necessary?]Anyway, since the Mu Clan had fully retreated, Steward Song sighed with relief.At least the safety of his young master was assured for the immediate future.However, panic overtook him once again! Ye Xiao was missing!It had been two days since his young master was last seen and he had already asked Lord Lan, Lord Zuo and Lady Su about his whereabouts. However, even his closest friends didn\u2019t have a clue about where he could be. For Steward Song, the only possibility was that his young master was missing!At that moment, Steward Song was totally stunned![Could it be\u2026 that master was kidnapped by the Mu Clan? Otherwise, why would the Mu Clan leave in such a hurry?]Anger had clouded his judgement, as he led his 36 Blood Guards to the Southern Gate!\u201cWe have to save our lord! Even if we have to give up our lives!\u201d He ordered like a homicidal maniac as his eyes were bloodstruck!He was really risking everything this time.The galloping of the horses sounded like a roaring thunder, bringing forth a surging killing intent.These veterans who had retired from their former lives of swords and blood, none of them were ordinary people. This time, they were emitting fierce vigor and violent killing intent, which they had been suppressing for years. Everywhere they passed, the surrounding people would instantly become terrified.They kept rushing south, disregarding the exhaustion of their horses, which were nearing Death\u2019s gate. They had gone hundreds of miles until they arrived below a mountain. Once they had reached the foot of the mountain, they cried out in alarm as they held their horses!What they could see was a hellish scene that was too horrible to look at!Tens of men and tens of horses were lying in disorder on the floor. All of them were bloodied corpses. Not a single one was left alive!\u201cThey\u2026 They are the people of the Mu Clan!\u201dOne of the Blood Guards looked at the sign of the broken carriage, on which the Mu Clan\u2019s insignia could be seen. The sign had been cut into half but it was still identifiable.\u201cThe people of the Mu Clan? Why are they all dead?\u201d The steward dismounted his horse, while a frown appeared on his face.\u201cThey have all died and all of their belongings are gone\u2026\u201d One of the other Blood Guards, who was big and tall with a full beard said, \u201cDid they encounter bandits? How else could this scene be devoid of valuables? This was a professional hit!\u201d\u201cBullshit. In a suburb of the capital, what kind of robbers could have been so strong to rob and kill the people of the Mu Clan? Let alone in the suburb, even in the whole Kingdom of Chen, even in the whole Land of Han-Yang, do you really really think there could be such powerful bandits?\u201d The steward scolded, \u201cAre you a pig?\u201dThe Blood Guard grinned and rubbed his head, \u201cNo\u2026\u201dPeople started laughing.The steward checked around carefully, but found no traces. He murmured, \u201cWhat kind of people could do this so cleanly? That is really illogical!\u201d\u201cThere are seventy bodies in total. Except for the eight guys that died in our house, all the people of the Mu Clan that entered the capital of the Kingdom of Chen are here. Not even a single one survived.\u201dOne of the Blood Guards looked at one of the bodies on the floor and said, \u201cThe old man in the middle is Mu Zi-He. He was the leader of the group for this trip. He was the fourth younger brother of the patriarch, and he has a high position even though he was only in the Grade of Diyuan. He died here anyway. The people who killed him must have thought nothing about leeway this time.\u201d\u201cAnd they have done it so cleanly.\u201d The steward sighed. He realized more and more that this thing was too complicated.It was even possible that the Ye Clan would be blamed again..The problem was, that it truly had nothing to do with them. Even if every force of the Ye Clan got together, they would never have a chance to do such thing. In fact, Steward Song was actually determined to die this time as long as they could chase the people of the Mu Clan down.He knew how powerful the Mu Clan was. If the Ye Clan fought against them directly, it would be not far from an ant hitting a tree. In Steward Song\u2019s mind, if his young master was really captured by the Mu Clan and they could catch up with them, there was still a tiny chance to rescue Ye Xiao even if it meant losing all of his people in battle.With such a powerful force, these Mu Clan people were actually wiped out. How powerful would the killers have to be. To the most conservative projection, there absolutely wasn\u2019t such a powerful force in the Kingdom of Chen!\u201cLook! The mountainside!\u201dOne of the Blood Guards shouted.The steward looked up and was immediately stunned.He nearly slapped himself on the face. He had actually been worried about being framed and kept saying that it was done too cleanly.It turned out the killers hadn\u2019t even thought about hiding their identities. In fact, they had even gone ahead and left a message, notifying the world that it was their doing!They hadn\u2019t noticed the obvious words on the mountainside, because what was in front of them had been too stunning for them. The words on the mountainside were totally undisguised, but they had made the \u2018black under the light\u2019 kind of mistake \u2013 they hadn\u2019t noticed the obvious place and made a foolish mistake.[TL note: \u2018black under the light\u2019, \u706f\u4e0b\u9ed1, means people are not aware of the events that distinctly occur around them.]\u201c\u6155\u6c0f\u592a\u7316\u72c2\uff0c\u7279\u610f\u6765\u65ad\u5934\uff1b\u82e5\u95ee\u6740\u4eba\u624b\uff0c\u7ffb\u4e91\u8986\u96e8\u697c\uff01\u201d(The Mu Clan is too arrogant, so we came and killed them on purpose; to anyone who wishes to know who did this, it was the great House of the Chaotic Storm!)Below the words there was a pattern of a building in the storm which was drawn intentionally with blood.It was actually quite vivid. Obviously, after the killers wiped these people out, they actually drew a pattern here leisurely.\u201cThis this this\u2026 This is so\u2026\u201dA Blood guard was stunned, \u201cIt is so arrogant\u2026 This House of the Chaotic Storm\u2026 What is it?\u201dThe steward\u2019s face was blank, \u201cMind your words. Since there is no trace of our lord here, he wasn\u2019t captured. We need to go back right away. It won\u2019t bring any good to stay in such muddy waters.\u201dIt could be seen from his face. He was far from relaxed; instead, a deep sense of worry was plastered on his face.[The House of the Chaotic Storm. Finally, they showed up!The most mysterious and terrifying force in the world.]The steward was terrified.When he saw the words \u2018House of the Chaotic Storm\u2019, he couldn\u2019t stop his heart from beating heavily.He was frightened! Not only was he unable to find his young master, he had even stumbled upon information about the House of the Chaotic Storm\u2026He felt rather upset, as nothing seemed to go his way.When they all returned home, they started to search around again. Although they had searched the whole capital, they failed to find any clues about Ye Xiao\u2019s whereabouts.That night, the steward wasn\u2019t able to fall asleep.The next day they continued their search, yet, it was to no avail.Not only were the people of the Ye Clan trying their best to search for Ye Xiao, Zuo Wu-Ji and Lan Lang-Lang also sent a lot of people to help them find Ye Xiao.People were worried, especially Zuo Wu-Ji. After he had brought the jade ru-yi home from the auction, he had earned a title of \u2018a prodigal who returns, is more precious than gold\u2019. That really had delighted him.And all of this was only possible because of Ye Xiao\u2019s help. Now that Ye Xiao was missing, how could he not be worried.Lord Lan was also worried. He kept his eyes widely opened and searched everywhere with his men. He had been searching for a long time, but was yet to find even a single clue. It wouldn\u2019t be long before he would completely freak out!\u201cWhy can\u2019t we find him!\u201d Lan Lang-Lang\u2019s eyes were bloodshot as he furiously yelled, \u201cYou\u2019re all useless garbage! Keep searching! Don\u2019t you even miss a rat\u2019s hole!\u201d\u201cMy lord, it was the Lord Sun\u2019s house in front\u2026\u201d\u201cScrew it! I don\u2019t care what lord he is. Get in and search!\u201d\u201cMy lord, it was the Lord Sun\u2019s home\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cGET IN AND SEARCH!\u201d\u201cWhat? Who dares to stop me? BEAT HIM UP! SMASH EVERYTHING\u2026 GET IN! AH, AH, AH, AH\u2026\u201d\u2026After searching one street, he was caught and sent back home.Did this moron come to help searching? Or did he just come to make trouble for his own family?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Keep your baby son under control! Otherwise, I will use my law to do it for you!\u201dThe Lan Clan was frightened, so they hurriedly sent people to drag their young lord back home.As Lan Lang-Lang was being dragged home, he struggled with his legs swinging and he kept shouting, \u201cGet off me! I am looking for Xiao Xiao\u2026\u201dZuo Wu-Ji was totally disdainful of his foolish acts: [It is just simply searching for someone, and you can actually make things look like you are confiscating somebody\u2019s property\u2026 Your head should have been cut off\u2026]The Prince Hua-Yang\u2019s house also heard that people were looking for Ye Xiao. The young princess immediately gave her order and the guards in the house all got out to help search in the capital.Three forces were working together in order to find Ye Xiao.The young princess, Su Ye-Yue, hurried over to Ye Xiao\u2019s house with her maid.\u201cFound him?\u201d\u201cWhy have you still not found him yet?\u201d\u201cIs there anything bad happening to him?\u201d\u201cIs it possible that he\u2019s simply having too much fun at a brothel? So much that he can\u2019t even get himself to leave? Follow my lead!\u201dThe girl gave her order with a shout and the brothels in the capital were all in bad luck. Every brothel was broken into and searched. All the clients were kicked out of their rooms and stood in a line in the gardens\u2026The clients were all disgraced. However, they felt less embarrassed when they saw that everyone else was naked too. What was there to feel ashamed about, when everyone looked the same\u2026At the beginning, they instinctively raised their hands to cover their faces, because they could be identified by their face. They thought it was better to cover the face, as the rest of their bodies were usually no different with others. However, after a while, some of them looked around and stopped covering their faces. Instead, they started to cover their crotches with shame. It turned out they were not entirely the same in some places of their body and the difference was very obvious.Of course, some other guys also stopped covering their faces, but they didn\u2019t cover their crotches either. They actually acted like they were swaggering around by standing there with legs astride. They looked proud. There were difference between two men not only in their faces, but also in some special place, and the difference was also very obvious\u2026Ahem, what exactly was so obvious? (I surely have no idea what it is, as I am an innocent person\u2026 I don\u2019t understand what this is all about\u2026)While the disturbance was spreading in the capital\u2026The young lord, Ye Xiao, that everybody was looking for, finally returned.On his way back, he found a silent place and reverted back to his true face. Although there were wounds on his face, Wen-Ren Chu-Chu hadn\u2019t hit him too heavily after all. Besides, the East-rising Purple Qi was truly a remarkable martial art. With its help, all of his wounds were nearly healed\u2026So the Xiao Monarch still retained his decency more or less\u2026Once he stepped in the street in front of his house, he heard a large amount of people cheering!\u201cThe young lord is back! Our young lord is back!\u201dThose were his servants that were cheering.\u201cLord Ye is back! Lord Ye is back!\u201dThat was from the people of Zuo Xiang Fu and the people of the Palace of Hua-Yang.\u201cThank god this fella is back. I can finally seize peace\u2026\u201dThat was from some other people. They felt lucky. They couldn\u2019t resist feeling lucky; after he was missing, their houses had been searched dozens of times every single day\u2026Who could bear such annoyance?Whenever those people searching for Ye Xiao entered their houses, their doors would be opened with a thunderous sound and they would be forced to squat down.That was really such an unbearable memory\u2026When Su Ye-Yue heard that Ye Xiao was back, she rushed out like a whirlwind and stood at the door akimbo, shouting angrily, \u201cWhere were you and what have you been doing! Bastard! Come over! I will teach you some lesson for real!\u201dYe Xiao felt warm in his heart.The girl was shouting with anger, but in her voice, her concern was easily discerned.Besides, while shouting, her eyes had already turned red, and her mouth was twitching; it looked like she was about to cry\u2026At this moment, she was truly adorable!Watching Ye Xiao walking over leisurely, she felt truly surprised, as she felt like she had recovered everything that she had lost. She suddenly rushed down from the doorsteps. Her small figure was about to run into Ye Xiao\u2019s arms. However, without any reason, she suddenly stopped!She stopped at the place about half a meter away from Ye Xiao and looked at him. She spoke, \u201cYou\u2026 You are not a ghost, are you?\u201dShe reached her hand to touch his body and then his face. She felt the warmth of his body and suddenly shouted, \u201cYou didn\u2019t die!\u201dShe jumped up high.And then the tears started to flow down.These last two days, in which Ye Xiao had been missing, had truly been terrifying for this girl.She had pretended to be calm at the beginning until she could no longer do so. Then she went out to search with her men, but she couldn\u2019t find anything.In fact, although nobody gave up searching, most of the people had long lost hope!Usually, they wouldn\u2019t worry. They knew that Ye Xiao could completely lose track of time while he was fooling around outside.However, this time, it had been right when the Mu Clan was in the capital!His biggest enemy was right outside, preparing to kill him!In people\u2019s minds, Ye Xiao\u2019s disappearance must have something to do with the Mu Clan. However, those people of the Mu Clan were all dead\u2026 Ye Xiao was still missing!They had searched the entire capital, but they had actually failed to find even a single clue.Except assuming the worst situation, they didn\u2019t know what else to think.When they were about to lose their hopes\u2026 He actually showed up from the corner of the street. He actually walked over calmly and leisurely.The surprise brought by his appearance actually made people freak out.\u201cWhat are you talking about? Why would I die? I am totally fine!\u201d Ye Xiao touched his nose and said. His heart felt warm. Although it was at dusk and the sun was setting, he actually felt good about the afterglow.A feeling of \u2018is it the close affection of the world\u2019 filled his heart.\u201cIn such a special time, why were you still fooling around? Where the hell have you been?!\u201d The princess who had just relaxed suddenly stopped feeling joyful; some negative emotions that were caused by the extreme anxiousness totally exploded. She shouted fiercely, \u201cDo you even know what a special moment it is right now! Do you know we have nearly gone mad trying to find you! Do you know how dangerous it is! Do you know how much I care about you\u2026 Do you know\u2026\u201dShe shouted loudly while swinging her hands; almost half of the street could hear her clearly.And then she suddenly paused. She stopped shouting. The next moment, she cried loudly. \u201cWAH!\u201d She jumped into Ye Xiao\u2019s arms and held him tight. She quivered because of crying.With a beauty in his arms, Ye Xiao turned stiff. His hands were hanging in the air and he didn\u2019t know what to do.A man with an EQ of zero was exactly like that; he completely had no idea how to deal with such situations!A beauty threw herself on him\u2026 He hadn\u2019t experienced such a thing before \u2013 in both of his lives\u2026 Instantly, he felt anxiety overtaking him. He wanted to push her away, but felt as if it was wrong to do so\u2026 In fact, he felt a certain hint of warmth in his heart, as her actions had really moved him.The next moment, a thought that had never occurred to him appeared in his mind: [In my present life, I am no longer cultivating the Pure Yang Martial Art. I don\u2019t need to fear that thing\u2026]And then he kept his arms open and watched Su Ye-Yue weeping in his arms. Her tears and snots were on his clothes, but he had a feeling of tender affection. He slowly\u2026 furled his arms.Eventually, he held the small body in his arms slowly and firmly.It was unprecedented; that was truly his first time in both his two lives to hold a woman so completely and so earnestly!At this moment, his heart was beating wildly.At the same time, a happy feeling of \u2018possession\u2019 filled his heart.That feeling was new and touching for him. It was a feeling that he couldn\u2019t let go and didn\u2019t want to let go. (Ahem. It is exactly what I felt when I first held my wife\u2026)Su Ye-Yue cried for a long time until she realized she was weeping in Ye Xiao\u2019s arms. She hastily pushed his arms away and wiped her eyes. She didn\u2019t dare to raise her head, as she spoke with her face blushed, \u201cWhere am I\u2026\u201dAnd then she turned around and ran into the house like a rabbit with her head low.It was truly a scene of the saying: \u2018keep silence like a virgin, run like a running rabbit\u2019. It was no doubt that the girl was a virgin; but the so-known Xiao Monarch was\u2026 also a virgin![TL note: \u2018keep silence like a virgin, run like a running rabbit\u2019 the literal translation of \u9759\u82e5\u5904\u5b50\uff0c\u52a8\u82e5\u8131\u5154.]The girl actually felt embarrassed\u2026Ye Xiao shouted behind her, \u201cWatch out! Watch your step! Don\u2019t run onto the wall\u2026\u201dThe voice of Su Ye-Yue with shame and anger came immediately, \u201cNone of your business!\u201d And then she disappeared.The onlookers laughed with kindness. They even felt inspired by the pure affection between them.\u201cOff you guys\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao swung his hand casually, \u201cYes, I am back. I am fine\u2026 Heh heh heh\u2026 Be off now please. Everything\u2019s fine.\u201dThe steward hurriedly gave an order to a guard, \u201cGo to the house of Lan and tell Lord Lan Lang-Lang that our Lord Ye Xiao is back\u2026 Tell him not to worry.\u201dThe guard nodded his head and hurriedly left.What if nobody informed Lan Lang-Lang?! How many more stupid things could he possibly come up with\u2026Zuo Wu-Ji stepped forward and laughed, \u201cXiao Xiao, now that you are back and safe, I guess I should just be off then. If not\u2026 hahahahaha\u2026 I am afraid I would get beaten up hard.\u201dHe made a weird laughter with an undetermined meaning. He then waved his hand and left with his men.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter seeing his best friend leave, Ye Xiao entered the house. The steward had his usual bright smile on his face until Ye Xiao entered, when his face instantly darkened, \u201cMy lord, your wounds\u2026\u201dYe Xiao swung his hand, \u201cNothing serious. I was captured. It took me quite some effort to get back\u2026\u201d\u201cWho dared to do so?\u201d The steward turned furious.[So even when there is no Mu Clan, there is still another force after our young lord?! This is something that should definitely be looked into more closely.]\u201cHmm. About that\u2026 You don\u2019t need to worry\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao spoke, \u201cI have turned them into friends. No. In fact, they weren\u2019t hostile to me at the beginning. Anyway, they are most likely off the capital already. It isn\u2019t worth mentioning anymore.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

All dead? What\u2019s going on exactly? Do you know who did it?\u201d\u201cIt is confirmed.\u201d The steward frowned, \u201cIt must be the most mysterious organization in the world, the House of the Chaotic Storm\u2026 No one was left alive and they even left some words for the world to see\u2026 It seems that the House of the Chaotic Storm is deliberately going against the Mu Clan?\u201dYe Xiao immediately realized something.[It seems that Xiu Of The Heavens has really done it!]She had actually done it without any reservations; she had completely wiped out the members of the Mu Clan that had entered the capital. She was decisive, heartless, cruel and powerful, all at the same time\u2026It really scared Ye Xiao.\u201cThe House of the Chaotic Storm, which many thought to be only a myth, have really surfaced.\u201d Ye Xiao murmured. His eyes lit up, as he recalled the day when he had chased those men to the mountain\u2026The bamboo forest\u2026It must have something to do with the House of the Chaotic Storm.[Sometime in the future, when the sky is clear and dry, I\u2019ll take some gasoline and burn that bloody bamboo forest down\u2026 Let me see what can be lured out of it\u2026]When he returned to his garden, he saw Su Ye-Yue sitting in the pavilion, resting her jaw on her hands. She was gazing at the moon in the sky.Ye Xiao walked over gently and sat opposite to her.The girl looked at the moon and said, \u201cXiao Xiao, do you ever wonder\u2026 if there are people on the moon?\u201dYe Xiao replied, \u201cI suppose so. According to the myths, a goddess lives there, Chang-Er, right?\u201dThe girl answered with a \u2018hmm\u2019 and said, \u201cXiao Xiao, you got me so worried.\u201dYe Xiao smiled warmly, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Who am I? I\u2019ll always be ok.\u201dSu Ye-Yue nodded softly and said, \u201cYou\u2019re fine now\u2026 But, I was really scared\u2026\u201dShe became silent for a while, before suddenly speaking out in high spirits, \u201cXiao Xiao, you didn\u2019t go to the auction the other day! What a pity! I was there and it not only opened my eyes, I even gained something. It is a book, the Sword Art Of Feng-Hua. It\u2019s a marvelous sword technique! I can be a superior cultivator from now on\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Sword Art Of Feng-Hua? Is it really that powerful?\u201d Ye Xiao frowned, \u201cLet me have a look.\u201dGenerally, this kind of request was inappropriate. If Steward Song was present, he would\u2019ve definitely stopped him straight away. The martial art books that were qualified enough to be sold at the high-level auction of the Ling-Bao Hall were at least high-grade books. Anyway, he was still the Xiao Monarch inside, so he only intended to identify the book. Even with his greedy eyes, he wouldn\u2019t spare it a glance. As for the girl\u2026Of course she wouldn\u2019t mind.She grinned before producing a book from inside her clothes and giving it to Ye Xiao. Only now did Ye Xiao notice the elegant sword placed on the stone chair beside her.[It seems that the girl is really interested in martial arts. I wonder whether the book is the complete version or if it\u2019s only an unfinished work.] Ye Xiao wondered and asked, \u201cYue, what level have you reached in your cultivation?\u201dSu Ye-Yue turned a bit bashful as she answered, \u201cAbout the 7th level of the Grade of Ren-Yuan\u2026\u201d\u201cLevel 7. The Grade of Ren-Yuan\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao nodded and felt a bit surprised. As a spoiled princess in the Palace of Hua-Yang, she had actually reached the seventh level of the Grade of Ren-yuan. This was already quite impressive. So he said, \u201cDid you start cultivating since you were a kid?\u201d\u201cNah\u2026\u201d Su Ye-Yue hesitated, but she decided to continue, \u201cMy father has been fighting on the battlefield his entire life, so he didn\u2019t want me to learn any martial arts. He thinks that a girl lacks delicacy if she decides to practice any kind of martial arts. I have always been interested in it though. Since two years ago, I started to learn something from the guards of my house\u2026 Well, I have to keep it a secret and not let my father notice. So I am doing \u2018three days fishing, two days drying nets\u2019 [1]; I only practice occasionally. Sigh\u2026 It is a pity that the guard who taught me the cultivating method died in a battle not long after the last lesson\u2026\u201dYe Xiao was shocked![What?Two years ago?Taught by a guard?Practiced secretly?\u2018Three days fishing, two days drying nets\u2019?!And she actually reached the seventh level of the Grade of Ren-Yuan in two years?Is she a monster or something?]With a record like that, she could be counted as a person having a fine aptitude but not outstanding in the Qing-Yun Realm. However, they were living in the Land of Han-Yang. With such an achievement, it might not be enough to call her a genius among geniuses!And she was cultivating without her parent\u2019s permission; she practiced secretly; she cultivated from time to time\u2026That meant no one was guiding her!At the first place, the guard that had been teaching her had already died in battle\u2026 That meant the guard only had an average aptitude in cultivation. How could the cultivating method used by such a man be any good?Under all these negative conditions, she had been cultivating on her own and had actually achieved the seventh level of the Grade of Ren-Yuan.This was just inconceivable!The Xiao Monarch was really astonished!He nearly wanted to believe that the person in front of him was a monster!\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Su Ye-Yue noticed that Ye Xiao had become silent, so she hastily asked, \u201cAm I too slow? Am I too weak? My father had always said that I have no talent in cultivation, that I am not qualified for cultivation\u2026\u201dYe Xiao\u2019s mouth quivered, [What? No talent in cultivation? Not qualified for cultivation?What the hell\u2026 If you are not qualified for cultivation, there won\u2019t be any people qualified for cultivation.]Ye Xiao wasn\u2019t born in a noble clan in his previous life; he had been an orphan. After he had luckily gained the Pure Yang Martial Art, his cultivation speed was praised as \u2018one day, a thousand miles\u2019[2] by his master. He had even been compared to a peerless genius that was seen once every ten thousand years!However, now that he learned about Su Ye-Yue, he finally realized that there was always someone better in the world. Su Ye-Yue\u2019s aptitude should be at least superior to his aptitude in his previous life.\u201cI think cultivation suits you.\u201d The Xiao Monarch said, \u201cCome on. Let me check your aptitude.\u201dAfter speaking, he immediately held her hands.Honestly, he really had no intention to take advantage of her. He just wanted to know more about the monster-like genius sitting in front of him!Her hands were cool and soft like jade. The East-rising Purple Qi instantly operated and a tiny but long stream of spiritual power ran around her entire Jing and Mai.And then Ye Xiao loosened her hands and laughed bitterly.He laughed bitterly out of amazement and self-mockery. If he had already been a genius that was rarely seen in even ten thousand years, then how were people to describe her aptitude? Rarely seen monster? Immoral and against nature itself? He couldn\u2019t believe that her aptitude was much better than what he had expected.In terms of aptitude, she was better than Ye Xiao in his previous life, and she was no less than the outstanding Wen-Ren Chu-Chu that he had just met \u2013 in fact, she was even better than Wen-Ren Chu-Chu. However, she\u2019d never had a good teacher and had been cultivating all by herself. She had gone through many unnecessary paths that had damaged her Jing and Mai\u2026However, this damage was almost negligible in Ye Xiao\u2019s eyes.[\u201cFemale body of Spiritual Yin. Natural-born superior Jing and Mai. Bones of pure Yin. The Jing and Mai are like rivers. This body is totally a perfect body for a cultivator\u2026\u201d] Ye Xiao sighed, [\u201cIf a person like her was in the Qing-Yun Realm, even the two super sects will fight so hard to have her as their inheritor! The interesting thing is that in the Land of Han-Yang, her father actually forbids her from cultivating, and he has told her that she was unqualified for cultivation\u2026\u201d]This time, Ye Xiao had truly understood several words: a reckless waste of god\u2019s good gifts, the pearls were covered by dust![3]This was mind blowing!\u201cClose your eyes. I will give you a present\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao spoke gently.\u201cWhat present?\u201d She was embarrassed and happy at the same time. It was the first time she would receive something from Ye Xiao. She closed her eyes as he told her to.\u201cOpen your mouth.\u201d\u201cAhh~\u201dThe next moment, she felt warmth within her mouth as a round dan bead was placed on her tongue. It quickly dissolved into a fluid and passed through her throat and went into her stomach. She was flurried and suddenly felt a fragrance spread inside her mouth. When she was about to carefully taste it, the fluid had already turned into some kind of hot qi, which was flowing throughout her entire body, including her Jing and Mai.She felt an indescribable sense of comfort spreading all throughout her body.She immediately opened her eyes, \u201cWow? It feels so good! What was it? Why was it so tasty? Do you have more?\u201dApparently, she wanted a second bite after enjoying the taste.It was understandable for a little girl to have such an idea! However, she didn\u2019t know that all the negative influence in her Jing and Mai had completely vanished after eating that tiny dan bead!In fact, it had even strengthened her!Ye Xiao could only smile bitterly.He asked her to close her eyes and then he placed a Pei-Yuan Dan Bead into her mouth in order to help her wipe the illnesses inside her body. He had good intentions, but the girl actually wanted to eat the dan beads like sweets. That was a bit over the top. Although he was capable of providing her with more of these \u2018sweets\u2019 since he had the powerful Spaces under his control, it would still be quite a waste.\u201cNo. That\u2019s the only one.\u201d Ye Xiao threw his hands high up in the air.At the moment, there were still some things he couldn\u2019t let the girl know.If the girl had a big mouth and spread the information about, there would never be another day of peace for him.\u201cSo tasty.\u201d Su Ye-Yue licked her lips to enjoy the endless aftertastes and regrettably said, \u201cIf there are more of this kind of tasty beans, then I can eat eighty or a hundred everyday\u2026 I would never think that it is too much.\u201dYe Xiao was speechless. [Taking the undeserved gain for granted; what a girl.Eighty or a hundred everyday?That is truly\u2026]The next moment, the girl suddenly frowned, \u201cOh no. Pain in my belly\u2026\u201d She jumped up and looked around, \u201cNo no no no no\u2026\u201d And then she left rapidly.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euYe Xiao furrowed his brows; he had actually forgotten about this\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026[1] \u2018three days fishing, two days drying nets\u2019 :- It is a metaphorical description of people who lacks perseverance and don\u2019t persist on doing things.][2] \u2018one day, a thousand miles\u2019: \u4e00\u65e5\u5343\u91cc, literally means traveling a thousand miles within one day.

It was proof that her aptitude for cultivation was exceptional.After all, what she experienced was not the ablution of muscles and bones.In the time it took for an incense stick to burn, faint footsteps indicated Su Ye-Yue\u2019s return. She groaned and complained, \u201cXiao Xiao\u2026 you had given me a cathartic pill, right? It seriously made me feel ill\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. Take some rest and you will be fine. You will feel refreshed in just a seconds\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao smiled as he spoke.He wasn\u2019t just comforting her. She had suddenly expelled a massive amount of impurities from her body. It would surely cause her body functions to be disrupted for a short period of time, but it was a part of the self-adjustment process. After a few hours, the process would end, and all the discomfort would be dispelled. Afterwards, the advantages of expelling the impurities would become evident.\u201cWell, I better go home then\u2026 My stomach feels really terrible. It won\u2019t look decent if I stayed here.\u201d Su Ye-Yue answered faintly.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Just spend the night over here.\u201d Ye Xiao persuaded her, \u201cI have already sent my men to inform your father. Besides, I won\u2019t be at ease if you were to go back like this.\u201dShe was looking really ill at the beginning, but when she heard Ye Xiao\u2019s words, she immediately felt a little refreshed. She gave a grin so wide that her canines became visible, \u201cAre you really worried about me?\u201dIf it was Wen-Ren Chu-Chu who was asked to stay overnight, she would instantly become worried about her reputation. This girl, on the other hand, was actually concerned about his sincerity. Ye Xiao sweated and nodded, \u201cYes. I do.\u201d\u201cFair enough.\u201d Su Ye-Yue\u2019s mind was pure like crystal water. She didn\u2019t even think of how inappropriate it would be if she were to stay overnight. Instead, she spoke happily, \u201cThen you should quickly prepare a room for me\u2026 I am going to rest. And I also need to take a bath. I should go to bed quickly, as I am so tired and sleepy.\u201dAs she had been anxious during the past few days, she was indeed exhausted.\u2026It was midnight.Ye Xiao sat on his bed, legs-crossed as usual, operating the East-rising Purple Qi. He was concentrating on his cultivation. This time, he was controlling the scorching hot power of the East-rising Purple Qi, so his entire body was shrouded by a mist of hot qi.After the preparation was completed, he took out three pieces of the Sky Crystal Sand, which he had purchased in the auction, and held them in his hand.The dense, scorching hot power of the East-rising Purple Qi suddenly gathered at the center of his palm!Ye Xiao felt like he was creating a micro-sun in the palm of his hand.Beads of sweat started to gather on his forehead as he rapidly operated the energy with all of his efforts, trying to complete this micro-sun as soon as possible.The pieces of Sky Crystal Sand laying in his hand were slowly rotating, while they were being enveloped by the scorching hot power of the East-rising Purple Qi. It could be faintly seen that, while the Sky Crystal Sand pieces had turned red hot, they were not really melting.It was unbelievable that the Real Soul Fire, which originated from the East-rising Purple Qi, and was the top-class power in the world, actually failed to melt the Sky Crystal Sand![TL note: It seems the scorching hot power he was using in his hand is called the Real Soul Fire (\u771f\u5143\u4e4b\u706b).]Ye Xiao breathed out in a rush and his entire body felt weak. He stopped operating the martial art and returned the Sky Crystal Sand pieces. He murmured, \u201cMy cultivation is insufficient\u2026 I am unable to melt it.\u201dHis plan this time was to melt the Sky Crystal Sand pieces and create a weapon for himself that he could properly use in his current condition. However, in spite of doing his best, it still couldn\u2019t be done and he had to give up.\u201cTo melt the Sky Crystal Sand, in terms of the general martial arts, even for the extremely high-level fire-attribute martial arts, would require a cultivator to be at the eighth level of the Grade of Diyuan at the very least. However, the East-rising Purple Qi is not some random martial art\u2026 Even though I failed this time, I think that I will be able to melt the Sky Crystal Sand once I reach the third level\u2026\u201dYe Xiao breathed out, \u201cI can do nothing at the moment after all\u2026 I have no choice but to wait till I reach the third level of the Grade of Diyuan and see what happens then.\u201dHe then grabbed the book of Sword Art of Feng-Hua that Su Ye-Yue had purchased in the auction. After examining it, he felt a bit speechless.It was exactly what he had expected. This book of the Sword Art of Feng-Hua was only a fragmented version, as the missing information would amount to far more than \u2018just a bit\u2019\u2026If she had followed this book to practice, with her peerless aptitude, she might achieve a lot, but eventually, she would most likely stop improving after reaching the Grade of Tianyuan. Plus, it was possible that certain long lasting side effects would appear.\u201cWell, let me complete it for you.\u201d Ye Xiao had travelled all over the world, so his understanding of martial arts was truly broad and profound. There were so many books of martial arts imprinted in his brain. The Sword Art of Feng-Hua wasn\u2019t some high-class sword play method. Let alone the fragmented book, even if it was the full version, it would merely be one of the \u2018first grade\u2019 level books.No matter what, it was surely far from \u2018supreme\u2019.However, he had to complete the book with the Sword Art of Feng-Hua as the base. Otherwise, if it drew attention, he would become the target of everyone\u2019s greed!Ye Xiao was always cautious about it.After he finished the book, Ye Xiao thought for quite a while and then integrated a copy of \u2018Scripture of Yin\u2019 into it.Among all the arts known by Ye Xiao, it was the premier martial art for girls to practice.\u2026The next morning, Su Ye-Yue, who had spent all night in General Ye\u2019s house, jumped over to Ye Xiao with a face filled with excitement and surprise.\u201cXiao Xiao!\u201d She leaned towards Ye Xiao and exclaimed, \u201cLook at me! Look at me!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Ye Xiao looked at her pretty face with a \u2018What are you talking about?\u2019 look on his face. He felt confused.\u201cAhhya\u2026 You pig!\u201d Su Ye-Yue pouted, and then she was back in good-spirits as she again pointed to her own face and said, \u201cLook at me again carefully. Take a closer look.\u201dYe Xiao carefully inspected her face and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me what exactly is going on?\u201dThis remark caused Su Ye-Yue to feel discouraged and spoke angrily, \u201cHaven\u2019t you noticed that my facial skin has become better?\u201dYe Xiao shook his head blankly, \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t. Is it really better now?\u201dSu Ye-Yue immediately felt depressed.She woke up early this morning to freshen and dress herself up, but when she looked into the mirror, she noticed that something was different \u2013 really different. She found that her skin had acquired a rosy glow, as it was both pink and white. She felt that she had become extremely beautiful, to the point where she wasn\u2019t even sure if she was awake or dreaming.Most importantly, there used to be some dark spots on her face, but at that moment, they had completely vanished.Facing such an astonishing change, she was naturally extremely excited, so she rushed to Ye Xiao inorder to show off. However, she wouldn\u2019t have imagined that this guy would actually fail to notice any difference\u2026\u201cYou are a complete moron!\u201d She was really upset.However, she was also thinking: [How come after sleeping here for just one night, my face has become so beautiful? Could it be\u2026 Could Ye Xiao\u2019s house actually be a wonderful place for beautification?]Although she didn\u2019t speak out, she had made up her mind: [In the future , I will definitely come here to sleep as often as I can.Humph! It is going to be my home sooner or later!]She grabbed her copy of Sword Art of Feng-Hua quickly and hung her head low and left grouchily.She wasn\u2019t aware that changes had been made to her incomplete copy of the Sword Art of Feng-Hua. Although Ye Xiao hadn\u2019t completely changed everything, he had changed a massive amount of details\u2026In fact, after she had gained the Sword Art of Feng-Hua, before she had time to check it out carefully, news of Ye Xiao\u2019s disappearance reached her ears. That was also the reason why she kept the book with her all the time.If she had read it even once, with her eidetic memory, she wouldn\u2019t really need to keep it by her side. So even though she would read it and practice with it, she would never find out that the contents had been changed.At the moment, a voice from outside reported, \u201cMy lord, people from the Palace of Hua-Yang have arrived, and they are saying that they have come with the order to take the princess back.\u201d\u201cOk then.\u201d Ye Xiao answered casually.A long time after the girl left the house of Ye, Ye Xiao started panicking: [Oh no! Am I going to be caught telling a lie?]Last night, Ye Xiao told her that he had sent people to inform the Palace of Hua-Yang about her staying overnight. In fact, he had never done that\u2026\u2026When she went back to the palace, without a doubt, she was severely scolded.\u201cThat was not presentable. That was unacceptable!\u201d Prince Hua-Yang was furious. He was utterly frustrated as if his most precious treasure was snatched by someone else. He scolded her while stomping his feet, \u201cYou are an unmarried girl. You had actually stayed overnight in your intended husband\u2019s house\u2026 You, you\u2026 you\u2026 you damn girl. You are trying to piss me off! Are you not?!\u201dShe kept her head low as she listened to him, but her expression showed indifference.[Dad is alway like this. He likes to make a fuss.]\u201cYou. You are going to completely disgrace me!\u201d Prince Hua-Yang paced around trying to find some tool for punishment, but how could he bear to see any of these tools being used on his precious daughter? So, eventually, he felt his anger and depression reaching new heights; his pace became faster.After a long time, she stood up and patted down the dirt on her knees, and then went into the inner house with a smile on her face\u2026Prince Hua-Yang gave out a long sigh. He felt that he was incompetent and had failed as a father. He had scolded his daughter severely, but had only made her smile\u2026\u201cMom, let me tell you a big secret.\u201d Su Ye-Yue cuddled in her mother\u2019s arms and spoke in a whisper.\u201cWhat big secret?\u201d The old princess asked with interest.\u201cWell the secret is\u2026 I had slept overnight in Xiao Xiao\u2019s house. This morning when I woke up, I found my skin had become delicately smooth\u2026\u201d Su Ye-Yue started flattering herself, \u201cMom, look at my face. Isn\u2019t it much more exquisite? Isn\u2019t it smoother? My facial skin is much better, isn\u2019t it? That is a big secret, isn\u2019t it?!\u201dAfter the old princess heard the big secret, her expression changed quickly. She stared at her daughter with a pale face. It was as if she had been struck by lightning, \u201cSlept overnight\u2026 Skin became better? That, that\u2026\u201dThe princess was quite well informed. She naturally knew that generally, before a girl got married, her skin would not be in the best condition.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe time that a girl\u2019s skin became radiant was right after she got married and was moistened by the rain and dew\u2026 The several years following that was the period of time when a girl was in her most beautiful condition.Now that she heard Su Ye-Yue say so, the thoughts of the princess went in the wrong direction: [This silly girl hadn\u2019t come home for a whole night. Did she actually do that thing with that guy Ye Xiao?That, that\u2026 that\u2026 Damn it\u2026]\u201cWhat exactly did you two do?\u201d The princess turned green in the face, \u201cYou you\u2026 You damn girl! How dare you do such a disgraceful thing! You are going to piss me off to death\u2026\u201dSu Ye-Yue was surprised after seeing her mother\u2019s reaction.

Finally, she realized that things were unlike what she had imagined; her thoughts had gone astray from too much worry\u2026Now, she felt relieved.[However\u2026 Humph!Her skin turned so exquisite after staying over for just one night\u2026Even if that kind of \u2018thing\u2019 didn\u2019t happen, other things must have definitely happened\u2026Otherwise, how can a girl suddenly become so radiant?If these \u2018other things\u2019 kept on happening, then that thing, which I am most concerned about, will happen eventually\u2026Although the two kids have already been engaged for a long time\u2026 such laughable things should never be allowed to happen!]The old princess made up her mind.Therefore, it didn\u2019t come as a surprise to anyone when Su Ye-Yue was grounded.She had been raising hell in her room for days, but still failed to get rid of the restrictions. She was extremely upset!She had never thought that she would actually be grounded, not even in her dreams.And of course, she didn\u2019t know that\u2026 it was purely because of that single sentence which she had said to show off.She get to know about this\u2026 in the very distant future\u2026\u2026It was inside the bamboo forest enclosed by the mountains.\u201cXiu-Er has made a reckless move this time. Please punish me.\u201d Xiu-Er, who was dressed in white, lowered her head and stood in front of the man who was also dressed in white, and was sitting on a wheelchair.The man in white sighed with his eyes half-closed and said, \u201cXiu-Er\u2026 Your actions have done a lot of damage to our plan this time\u2026 The Mu Clan has suffered greatly from this event. Now, they will never dare to return to the capital, even if we don\u2019t take the initiative to attack them.\u201dXiu-Er kept her head low, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHowever, that Mu Zi-He actually dared to abuse you. He deserved this. It was righteous that he died.\u201d The man in white smile blandly, \u201cWhatever.

You are speculating things accurately, master.\u201d\u201cHmm. But most of the other people from those sects haven\u2019t gone back, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThese men are staying here so that they can associate with the noble clans or even the royal clan, right?\u201d\u201cYes. You have sharp eyes, master.\u201d\u201cThis is not something special. These guys would never turn back without gaining some profits every time they leave their territories. These noble clans, officials and royal clans are exactly those who could offer them the profits they want.\u201dThere seemed to be a sense of disdain on his face. He sneered as he continued, \u201cIn fact, this world is truly weird. The noble clans regard the royal clan as a foolish entity, while those sects think that the people of the noble clans are fools. In the meantime, the royal clan considers the other two to be fools. It is like a bunch of fools playing a recurrent stupid game\u2026\u201d\u201cThe noble clans are using the royal clan. They are using the power of the royal clan to ensure their lifestyle and the continuation of their bloodlines\u2026 In their eyes, the royal clan is nothing but a tool that they can manipulate as they please\u2026\u201d\u201cThe sects think that the noble clans have no future\u2026 that they are still struggling to continue their bloodlines\u2026 since they have been struggling for thousands of years for nothing but the continuity of their ethnicity\u2026 So the noble clans are fools in the sects\u2019 eyes.\u201d\u201cThe royal clan think that they are holding supreme power and when it\u2019s needed, they can unite with the noble clans to fight against the sects, or use the sects to suppress the noble clans. They think that they could get an advantage from both sides, and claim the maximum profit for themselves. So they see both the sects and the noble clans as tools and fools\u2026\u201d\u201cHowever, in my opinion\u2026 In this world, these three stupid forces are merely maintaining the stupid balance\u2026\u201dHe spoke blandly, but had a profound look in his eyes, \u201cSo, as long as the unstable balance is broken, it will instantly turn into a situation where the current dynasty will be suppressed\u2026 No matter what, the present situation in the Land of Han-Yang is destined to lose its balance.\u201d\u201cA new dynasty will definitely rise and naturally, the previous dynasty will fall!\u201dAfter talking so much, he seemed a bit tired, so he leaned on his wheelchair and spoke slowly, \u201cHow to break the balance\u2026 Wan-Er, it\u2019s up to you.\u201d\u201cYes, master. The maid understands.\u201d\u201cHmm, have you settled on a plan?\u201d\u201cThe maid knows that as long as we kill one or two of the important characters of those sects that are in the capital\u2026 and plant some false trails\u2026 then the balance of the sects will be broken. Afterwards, we will draw the noble clans into the disturbance within the sects. When that happens, the royal clan will surely become involved\u2026 After that, no matter what the consequence will be, the balance will surely be broken, and massive cracks would have shown up for us to exploit.\u201d\u201cHowever, only after the end result can we decide our next move.\u201dThe man in white nodded with satisfaction, \u201cYour strategy is quite good. That is how it should be. However, you missed something. There are still wise men in the royal clan. The royal clan is the source of all disasters\u2026\u201dHe spoke with his eyes half-closed, \u201cAs for the present Kingdom of Chen, the ruling king is a bit too old\u2026 and the crown prince is a bit too impatient\u2026 because the other two princes have grown up and are ready to do something\u2026\u201d\u201cThe disturbance should begin with this. It was the most\u2026\u201dWhen speaking about this, he suddenly stopped and didn\u2019t continue.But Wan-Er\u2019s eyes lit up when she spoke, \u201cYes. Thank you for the enlightenment, master. The maid knows what to do now.\u201d\u201cHmm. Don\u2019t call yourself \u2018the maid\u2019 in front of me from now on. I feel uncomfortable hearing that.\u201d The man in white looked at Wan-Er and Xiu-Er gently and said, \u201cJust use your names.\u201dEcstasy flashed in both of their eyes at the same time. A blush appeared on their cheeks, as they answered, \u201cWan-Er/Xiu-Er complies with your wish.\u201d\u201cBreak the balance, then the dynasty changes. In a very short time, a new balance will be formed\u2026\u201d The man in white observed the clouds floating up in the sky and spoke blandly, \u201cDisturbance, it is as simple as that.\u201d\u2026While all this was going on, on the other side of the capital, Ye Xiao was wasting no time in order to cultivate.\u2026The capital was a lot more peaceful. The Prince\u2019s Palace stopped seeking further troubles. As for the Crown Princess, since the death of those people from the Mu Clan, she had been completely silent\u2026On the surface, it seemed that everything had been settled down and all the conflicts had reached a conclusion.However, there was one place that was still enveloped in chaos.The Ling-Bao Hall Salesroom!People including Guan Wan-Shan were so worried that they almost wanted to hang themselves!Everyone wore an anxious expression.The big boss of Ling-Bao Hall had actually come to the Chen-Xing City.The first thing Wan Zheng-Hao said when he arrived in front of the salesroom was, \u201cMy Cosmic Hades\u2026 You didn\u2019t sell it, right?\u201dHe asked it in haste!It was an extremely urgent issue!He didn\u2019t even give any conventional greetings to Guan Wan-Shan. He just walked in front of him and started asking questions.Guan Wan-Shan was immediately dumbfounded.[What does the big boss mean with that?We didn\u2019t even want to introduce it to the auction in the first place. It was you who demanded us to try to sell it out in every big auction. We had to sell it out no matter what price it cost\u2026 in case it humiliates you.Now we just got this \u2018hot potato\u2019 sold, yet you came right away to ask such a question.What does it mean?]\u201cIt has been sold.\u201d He composed himself and answered gingerly.\u201cSold?\u201d The big boss Wan Zheng-Hao\u2019s body quivered a little and his face suddenly turned pale. At this moment, he felt like he was about to lose control of his bowels.\u201cTo whom?\u201d A man in black closely following the big boss suddenly stepped forward and asked indifferently.This man had never accompanied the big boss before.So people felt strange when they saw him.But when he spoke, the big boss quivered a bit. Even his expression became terrified.Was this guy in a much higher social position than the big boss?Then who was this guy?\u201cIt was the man who took out the supreme dan\u2026 He bought the Cosmic Hades\u2026\u201d Guan Wan-Shan was perceptive and realized the seriousness of this situation, \u201cHis name is Feng Zhi-Ling\u2026\u201dHe had just finished his words when he saw the big boss\u2019s fat body quivering. The big boss\u2019s white fat face suddenly turned grey.\u201cThat is over\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe man in black beside him frowned and asked, \u201cCan we still find that guy now?\u201d\u201cYes. We absolutely can.\u201d Guan Wan-Shan confidently answered, \u201cBecause, after the auction, he didn\u2019t take all the money he had earned. He saved most of it in the salesroom\u2026 Even if he doesn\u2019t come to sell his supreme dan anymore, he will definitely come to collect the money.\u201dGuan Wan-Shan smiled blandly, \u201cNobody will give up such a big amount of money. Besides, he is short of money at the moment, so he won\u2019t give it up.\u201dWan Zheng-Hao and the man in black sighed with relief at the same time. They laughed and spoke in a chorus, \u201cThat\u2019s good. That\u2019s good!\u201d\u201cWell since it\u2019s like this, I think we should live in Chen-Xing City for some time. We can leave whenever we get back the Cosmic Hades.\u201d The man in black made a decision straight away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The continuous coughs made his face turn red. After coughing for a while, he started to laugh loudly.Wan Zheng-Hao\u2019s big fat face suddenly turned into the color of a pork\u2019s liver!\u201cBrilliant! Truly brilliant!\u201d The man in black gave a thumbs up and raised it to the nose of Wan Zheng-Hao, \u201cEven selling the entire Land of Han-Yang would never be enough to exchange for half of that Cosmic Hades, yet you sold it for just 250 thousand silver bars\u2026 Wan Zheng-Hao, in the entire universe, only you can absolutely claim the title of the super No.1 black sheep! You cannot decline to shoulder this title because you fully deserve it!\u201dWan Zheng-Hao felt humiliated and his face was completely red. He felt too ashamed to show his face, and so, he had no choice other than to lower his head.However, the man in black clearly didn\u2019t want to let it go.\u201cSuch thoughtless wastage is obviously indescribable and tremendous.\u201d The man in black shook his head and sighed, \u201cIt is a dissipation that could lead to chaos and darkness! It is really a high-class dissipation that could darken the moon and stars!\u201dBehind him, Guan Wan-Shan, who was following them up the stairs, happened to overhear this conversation. His sight turned dark as he sat heavily on the stone step.[What did I hear?Was it an illusion? Were my ears out of order? Or am I actually dreaming!]\u2026.Ye Xiao surely wasn\u2019t aware that the salesroom would be waiting for him and had set up a massive trap ready to be sprung at any time. At the same time, he had planned to return to the salesroom and claim his money after everything settled down.As of now, he was cultivating like a madman. After all, it was of utmost importance that his strength improves.Since he had some free time, he kept devouring all kinds of knowledge.As for the strange Space inside his body, he was using it extremely efficiently!There was another reason why he was working so hard. In the last few days, he had realized something, something that was so serious that he didn\u2019t know whether it was good or bad.Because of this \u2018something\u2019, he was more unwilling to go out.Because\u2026Inside the Sky Space, the Cosmic Hades, which was recently added, was truly powerful. It was way too powerful. The frost qi it was emitting was getting thicker and thicker, showing no signs of dissipation. Because it was too powerful, it had already made a severe impact on the other Spaces.The nine Spaces, by their nature, always restricted each other. The spaces complemented each other and it maintained a delicate balance. However, if one of them was far too powerful, to the point that it was beyond the summation of the power of the other eight, the balance would naturally be nonexistent. And right now, that was exactly what was happening. The Sky Space was too powerful and it seriously broke the balance of the Spaces.Ye Xiao clearly felt that the other Spaces were showing signs of suppression.Together, the eight Spaces actually failed to match the power of the frost qi released by the Cosmic Hades.If the situation kept on proceeding in this direction, where only the Sky Space remained powerful and the other Spaces became unable to restrict it, the balance between them would be completely broken. There could only be a single outcome \u2014 the Sky Space, which held the frost attribute, would absorb the other Spaces.This was without a doubt the last thing that Ye Xiao wanted to happen. With no other options available, he had to personally enter the Spaces and use the blue gelid qi of the East-rising Purple qi as the temporary bridge to transport the frost qi of the Cosmic Hades to the outer world![No matter how overbearing you are, you\u2019re just some frost qi of the Cosmic Hades, I will get you out of my endless Spaces to the outer world. After that, you won\u2019t be able destroy my Spaces anymore, will you!]He had no choices left, except for one last option. With the experience from his previous life, he knew that it was rather risky to do so. The East-rising Purple qi was the marvelous martial art created by the nature of heaven and earth, but Ye Xiao was inferior in cultivation at the moment. He doesn\u2019t have the least bit of certainty whether he could withstand the frost qi of the Cosmic Hades.That was some incredible power that even the other eight Spaces together could not compete against. Besides, even if the East-rising Purple qi was extremely powerful and could withstand the frost qi, during the transporting, it was Ye Xiao\u2019s body which needed to bear the impact of acting as the temporary carrier and bridge. With the current condition of his body, could he bear with it for long enough?However, Ye Xiao could only put all these thoughts aside. The current situation was so serious that his only option was to take this risk!In fact, it started out as a smooth process when he began drawing out the frost qi.More than that, after being extremely frightened, Ye Xiao was so astonished that he nearly dropped his jaws to the ground.The East-rising Purple qi was truly domineering. The powerful frost qi didn\u2019t have any influence on it. Moreover, after Ye Xiao drew out the frost qi and started transferring it inside his Jing and Mai, he realized something\u2026[What the hell!How come my gelid qi shows signs of improvement?The improvement is tiny, inconspicuous, but it certainly has improved for real!Is it really possible for such a good thing to happen?]While he was feeling surprised, he casually drew more of the frost qi and tried to test his observation.Unexpectedly something changed. \u2013 Boom!- The Spaces \u2018found\u2019 this \u2018outlet\u2019, pushing all the accumulated frost qi towards this point.What happened was that Ye Xiao became the only path to lighten the pressure produced by the frost qi.Ye Xiao\u2019s original intention was to join in and gradually release the pressure on the other eight Spaces. He was trying to draw away the frost qi gradually and steadily, however, perhaps the other eight Spaces were too exhausted after being pressured by the Sky Space, that they, without any delay, started to push the frost qi to the outlet they just discovered.This was killing Ye Xiao. He suddenly felt like he had fallen into a ten thousand year old ice cave. He was almost frozen into an ice sculpture.However, in such an extremely cold atmosphere, he suddenly realized that the East-rising Purple qi had actually become more active!The entirety of his Jing and Mai also began operating automatically!The frost qi released by the Cosmic Hades could actually enhance the cultivation of his gelid qi by a massive amount!When Ye Xiao realised this, he was instantly overjoyed. He entered the super intense full-cultivating mode during which he would neither eat nor drink. In order to do so, he \u2018invaded and occupied\u2019 the watchtower of the house of Ye!Because the territory of General Ye lacked any tall trees. The top of the watchtower was the place which was the closest to the sun.Ye Xiao gave the order that he would temporarily take over a sentry post on the watchtower.Everyday after that, as a precaution against getting recognized by others, he would wear the clothes worn by the guards\u2019 and sit in the watchtower with his legs crossed!He enjoyed the sunlight at daytime and absorbed the nimbus of the moon at night.He kept on cultivating throughout the day and night without rest!After a few days, all of the people in the Chen-Xing City felt that this summer had lost its heat.The powers of Yin and Yang complemented each other.Things would develop in a certain direction when the situation became extreme; the power of Yang rose when the power of Yin reached an extreme.Under the great influence of the frost qi and Ye Xiao\u2019s intake of heat through the sun, the strength of the East-rising Purple qi reached an abnormal level!The frost qi inside the Spaces rushed into his Jing and Mai with a crazy impetus, even the Yang qi from the world rushed into him with identical frenzy!Usually, when he cultivated the gelid qi, he needed to absorb the Yang qi into his body and use some martial art method to transform it, but now, he didn\u2019t need to do that anymore.Now that he had skipped the most demanding step, he just concentrated on absorbing the Yang qi to defuse the frost qi. With that, his cultivation was truly boosted at a tremendous pace!Along with the massive increase of the Yin qi, the Yang qi increased at the same time. With the exceptional East-rising Purple qi, there was bound to be no disharmony of Yin and Yang. The gelid qi improved rapidly and the power of Yang increased along with it. The power of Yang was never left behind that of the Yin at any time.After Ye Xiao entered the Spaces and took action, it only took one day to free the nine Spaces from imbalance and breakdown and restore the usual balance. The extra gelid qi kept flowing through Ye Xiao\u2019s Jing and Mai!He just felt like his body was a repeating\u2026 Hmm, in the modern world, it would be a repeating progress bar.The first level of the Grade of Diyuan!The progress bar was slowly filling up, but at a visible speed. Gradually\u2026 it reached the middle, and then the end\u2026-BOOM!- He felt like his body had turned into some nebula; he felt weightless and comfortable.And then another line in his Jing and Mai was suddenly split wide open. The second progress bar which represented the second level of the Grade of Diyuan appeared along with it. And then it slowly filled up\u2026 to the middle\u2026 the end\u2026 \u2013 BOOM! \u2013Level 3!When it got to level 3, the rate of improvement became slower.Ye Xiao was fully concentrating on cultivation. He cared about nothing else, but only on operating the martial art to boost his cultivation.In the house of Ye, the steward stood in the sunlight with his hands on the back. He looked up and watched the young lord on the watchtower. There was a gratified look on his face.[The young lord may have not achieved success in either wisdom or martial arts, but, at least he knows he should work hard now. That is a wonderful sign.He is not going be a civil officer as his father wants him to, but if he works hard enough in martial arts, maybe he will achieve something in the future.If the General comes to know of this, he will certainly be delighted.]\u201cIs the meal ready for the young lord? Bring up more restorative food.\u201d\u201cOh he has finished the last one? That is good.\u201d\u201cHave you delivered the water up to him yet?\u201d\u201cAnyone who dares to be lazy will be punished severely!\u201d\u2026For people in the Chen-Xing City, this summer was extremely comfortable.Usually, when the most scorching days in the year came, the whole Chen-Xing City turned into a huge stove; it could likely burn some fat out of the people.As for this year\u2026 Ha ha. It was actually neither hot nor cold. It was perfect!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euNobody knew that the heat was mostly transformed into energy by the East-rising Purple qi.This went on continuously for ten days.Ye Xiao had been concentrating in cultivating.He kept cultivating day and night with no rest.\u2026\u2026\u2026.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But Zuo Wu-Ji didn\u2019t come, and neither did Lan Lang-Lang. That was a bit odd.Ye Xiao stretched himself.After cultivating for ten days without taking any breaks, the extra frost qi in the Spaces had been mostly absorbed by Ye Xiao. Indeed, because of this, the dominant Sky Space had become meeker\u2026Ye Xiao knew that the depletion of the frost qi must be stopped before it\u2019s too late; he had already used more than enough.He decided to let the frost qi in the Sky Space go unchecked for the time being and wait a couple of days for it to accumulate. It wouldn\u2019t be too late to collect it when it once again starts to run wild.He stood up and slowly got down from the watchtower.The steward came to meet him right away, \u201cMy lord, how is it? You should have surmounted the fourth level of the Grade of Renyuan, right?\u201dIn fact, Ye Xiao had been stuck in the third level of the Grade of Renyuan for the past several years. The steward asked him in an encouraging fashion because he didn\u2019t want to hurt the young lord\u2019s confidence. [Surmount? How is it possible to break through so quickly? People have spent many years and still haven\u2019t managed a breakthrough for this single level.][Fourth level of the Grade of Renyuan?]Ye Xiao\u2019s lips quivered oddly and he said, \u201cHmm. More or less. I am about to reach level 4.\u201dThe steward was greatly gratified and smiled, \u201cYou have been working so hard these days. In fact, to cultivate, it requires a process of alternating work with rest and it also needs to proceed step by step. So take a good rest tonight.\u201dThe steward didn\u2019t know that although he was talking about the Grade of Renyuan, his young lord was talking about\u2026 the Grade of Diyuan.Although they were both talking about level 4, the difference between the two levels was like heaven and earth\u2026 If Ye Xiao had told him straightaway that he was about to reach the fourth level of the Grade of Diyuan, maybe the steward would have just passed out right away.\u201cWere there any unusual movements in the capital?\u201d Ye Xiao asked.\u201cHmm. Have some food for now. I will tell you what happened one by one after you eat.\u201d The steward said with a smile on his face.\u201cHmm. Uncle Song, join me for the meal.\u201d Ye Xiao replied with a smile.\u201cOk. Ok.\u201d Steward Song was delighted.\u201cThese days, the situation has been quite sensitive inside the Capital.\u201dThe steward spoke while he was drinking.Ye Xiao was surprised to notice that the steward drank in a weird way. He held the cup with two fingers and picked it up casually and naturally. No movement was made by his throat and no sound of drinking was heard, yet one cup of liquor was finished quickly and elegantly. After that, he casually filled his cup once more and drank it in one shot\u2026His speed of drinking was shockingly fast, but the way he drank was extremely elegant.The elegance in the way he drank made the Xiao Monarch feel a bit jealous. He had been a man of alcohol, a hardcore drinker in his previous life. He has naturally tasted a lot of good liquors, but speaking of the drinking culture he had, the elegant and lambent way Steward Song drank was something he could never achieve. Even if he tried imitating him, it was rather possible that he would likely \u2018draw a tiger into a dog\u2019 [1].\u201cSensitive? What does that mean?\u201d Ye Xiao felt that this steward of his family was absolutely not just some simple retired soldier. He must definitely have some special background.Firstly, he was perceptive; Secondly, he was elegant. Just with the way he drank, without systematic training and a subtle influence of past generations, he would never be able to show such a natural, noble demeanor\u2026Thirdly, he was mysterious. He never talked about his past\u2026 Fourthly, regarding his cultivation, even Ye Xiao couldn\u2019t see through him.There were many cultivation levels for the cultivators in the world. Generally, when a cultivator wasn\u2019t using his martial arts, it would be quite difficult to see his level or strength. Only when he showed his martial arts, would his true strength be revealed.A few martial arts existed which could be used to conceal the cultivators\u2019 cultivation levels.These kinds of martial arts didn\u2019t have the functions of nourishing growth, improving cultivation, curing wounds or injuring the enemies, but it was still quite useful in confusing and disturbing the enemies.Once a person cultivated such a martial art, he could hide his energy and conceal his strength to a certain extent. He could prevent the enemies from knowing his true strength so he could gain an element of surprise during a fight and sometimes, it could even help him turn the tide of a losing battle and alter the result.Only some supreme experts, through their experience and perception for danger, could estimate the enemies\u2019 cultivation before they have made any movements. The Xiao Monarch could surely do that. No matter what level the enemy was and how hard he tried to cover his strength, as long as he was in a lower level than the Xiao Monarch, his strength would be revealed with just a glance.However, Ye Xiao couldn\u2019t estimate the true cultivation strength of the steward.Although he had the same sight like in his previous life, he couldn\u2019t see through the steward at all. The only explanation was that the steward was at a much higher level than Ye Xiao.After all, Ye Xiao\u2019s shortcoming was his poor cultivation strength; it was only at the third level of the Grade of Diyuan.\u201cYes. Sensitive.\u201d The steward who was drinking in a rather elegant way, continued gulping drinks one after the other. It was as if he was holding the cup but never putting it down. \u201cThe king must be suffering a serious headache. The battle for the crown among the princes must have possibly started during the auction. However, the king is helpless and can do nothing about it.\u201d\u201cOh. I\u2019d love to hear more.\u201d Ye Xiao urged the steward to continue.He truly had never thought about this before.He might have experienced a lot, but he knew very little about the game played in the royal court of the mortal world. His knowledge regarding politics was next to nothing. This was an irrefutable fact that he had led a significantly different life compared to the mortals.\u201cThe king has always been supporting the crown prince and was using the second and the third prince as the grinders to sharpen him. He always encourages the two younger princes to fight against the crown prince, but absolutely prevents them from becoming more powerful than the crown prince. Grinders are only grinders after all. If the knife is tested excessively and breaks, it would go against the original intention of the grinding.\u201d\u201cAlthough the king kept on giving some hope to the other princes, making them think that they may have the chance to sit on the throne, he never really considered them as candidates to take the throne. There was never any doubt, the throne was meant only for the crown prince.\u201d\u201cThat is the politics of the kingdom.\u201d The steward smiled.\u201cPolitics\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao murmured.\u201cThe king has great talent and bold vision. That is undeniable. But he is unhealthy. That is the weakest point of all his plans. He had won the War of Eight Kings in the past, truly an incredible man. However\u2026 although the crown prince is also talented, he lacks experience. It is easy for him to safeguard the heritage, but if he wants to carry forward the king\u2019s plan of expanding the territory and obtaining the dominant position in this world, it is completely impossible.\u201d\u201cSo in order to train the crown prince, he raises the other two princes to oppose him. He wants to make the crown prince feel threatened, forcing him to work harder to improve. But the king always keeps the competition within the proper limits to \u2018prevent the grinders from breaking the knife\u2019 and also to \u2018keep the knife from consuming the grinders\u2019 too soon\u2026 The balance has always been well maintained by the king.\u201dYe Xiao nodded slowly.Yes, throughout history, that was what the kings would do.However, there were not many of them that could control the balance well.It seemed like the ruling king of the Kingdom of Chen was really a wise king.\u201cHowever, a few years ago, there was an accident that interrupted the grand plan of the king. It broke the balance. It was\u2026 that the crown prince had met a girl. The girl and the crown prince fell in love at first sight. The girl is from the Mu Clan, one of the eight noble clans. Although she is not the child of the patriarch, she is still the daughter of the second most important person in the Mu Clan.\u201d\u201cThe king always took precautions against the three clans that settled in the Kingdom of Chen, so he was naturally against the marriage. However, he had no legitimate reasons to stop this one. If he blocked it deliberately, it would not only hurt the relationship between the father and son, but it will also create an awkward situation whenever he faced the Mu Clan. After all, the Mu Clan is one of the eight noble clans; it is not something the king could easily deal with\u2026\u201d\u201cWith no other choice, he had to approve the marriage and let the girl be the crown princess. From then on, the power of the crown prince suddenly expanded, and it made the other two princes completely lose power to strike back.\u201d\u201cBut the two princes didn\u2019t sit still and await death. The throne has always fascinated people. Even though they only had little hope, they were not willing to let it go. The crown prince\u2019s marriage had suddenly diminished their powers, and guided the noble clans to a way where they could also expand their power\u2026 Thus, they sought out the other two noble clans in the Kingdom of Chen, and each of them proposed to one of their daughters\u2026 Among the three princes, the balance was restored. However, the balance was no longer firm; it was fragile.\u201d\u201cIn the old days, under the control of the ruling king, whenever balance between them became skewed due to one of them becoming too strong, the ruling king would naturally suppress the stronger party. However, right now, the control of the ruling king on the situation has been lacking. Once the situation becomes imbalanced, it will definitely lead to a huge crisis where all sides might collapse.\u201d\u201cIn fact, for a long time, because of the wariness of the ruling king, although the noble clans were rich and world-shaking, they hardly reached the level of authority commanded by the royal power. Yet, at that time, the king\u2019s sons actually went to them of their own initiatives\u2026 So the noble clans rather enjoyed it. It was exactly what they had dreamed about; they were like a fish which returned to clean waters. Even if they didn\u2019t have daughters, they would try to make up some, let alone when there were lots of pretty girls in the noble clans.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cSo the crown prince disappointed the king at that time, because the noble clans had all entered into the royal family. Moreover, he only had three sons, and now they were all sons-in-laws to the noble clans\u2026\u201d\u201cThis event had produced great chaos in the recent past\u2026 And now, everything seemed peaceful.\u201d\u201cThe king has made a great effort to define the powers of his three sons and distribute it. Now, it has become organized enough to make everything back to normal\u2026 That means the crown prince became a little bit stronger while the other two princes became slightly weaker. Only when the two princes work together could they have the chance to match the crown prince; it was a subtle balance. When the king was about to sigh with relief\u2026 suddenly, the auction popped up without any signs.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014[1] \u2018draw a tiger into a dog\u2019, literally means someone painted a tiger but it turned out a dog. It means someone tried to imitate others but failed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The machinations behind this event were really profound.\u201dYe Xiao nodded and answered with a \u2018hmm\u2019.Steward Song\u2019s analysis was incisive and it taught Ye Xiao a lot. However, what he cared about the most was something else.His steward was truly not an ordinary man, as he really didn\u2019t seem respectful to the king. How could such a man be ordinary!\u201cIf that was all that happened, it was fine\u2026 But the Mu Clan, who the crown prince depends on as if they are the Great Wall to him, actually messed with the unfathomable force, House of the Chaotic Storm, at this important moment\u2026 and their people got killed. They suffered a crushing defeat and a major decrease in their power. I believe that the Mu Clan wouldn\u2019t dare to take any reckless actions within the near future. They also have to worry about how to apologize to the House of the Chaotic Storm at the same time\u2026\u201d\u201cTherefore, the crown prince\u2019s power was doomed to be reduced badly. The other two princes definitely wouldn\u2019t let go of this opportunity, so they took advantage of the situation\u2026 The sects entered and settled in the capital. The royal court had just turned peaceful and then it once again returned into a chaotic situation\u2026 The king\u2019s worry is really no surprise!\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao nodded with indifference, but in his mind he couldn\u2019t help feeling dumbfounded.[Shit! I casually took out some garbage dan beads and it actually influenced the affairs of the kingdom like that?That\u2026 That is a bit too inconceivable\u2026]\u201cThat is the current situation in the capital, an extremely delicate and horrible balance.\u201d When Steward Song said this, he had already drunk about fifteen or sixteen cups, but his face was still not too red or too pale, as it still looked rather normal. He was a really good drinker.\u201cNow, the situation is like this. But because of the king\u2019s intentional interference, both the court officials and the military officers, especially the first class officials and the main officials in the military are all holding a watch-and-see attitude. However, since the king\u2019s health is getting worse, the watch-and-see attitude will change gradually. Once the king\u2019s health deteriorates too much, heh heh\u2026\u201dSteward Song sneered and said, \u201cWell, these are just the inner factors\u2026 The Kingdom of Chen\u2026 Heh heh. It is bound to be unsafe.\u201dYe Xiao asked, \u201cOther than the inner factors, are there really other factors?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dThe Steward drank another cup of liquor, \u201cNow, the other two kingdoms are ready to do something big. They recently made frequent military strength reassignments, and conducted many military rehearsals\u2026 Heh heh, there is something you don\u2019t know. To conduct one military rehearsal, it will need a huge amount of money. If they are not truly ready to start a war, they must be very stupid to do that so often. A war is basically a money game.\u201d\u201cIn fact, there are lots of signs proving my hypothesis. Basically, the price of all the goods in the market are rising. The increase isn\u2019t big, in fact, it\u2019s rising rather slowly. However, they are still rising. This upward price trend started ten days ago. Food, salt, meat, metal, steel, wood and plants\u2026 Everything is becoming more expensive.\u201dThe steward\u2019s eyes thoughtfully lit up, \u201cAbout ten days ago, we went to purchase food. It was 8 wen [1] for 500 grams of rice. Nine days ago, it was 8 wen and 5 li [2]. Six days ago, it reached 9 wen. Today, the price has reached 11 wen\u2026 Within ten days, it rose by 3 wen! It is only rice yet the price has already risen by more than 30 percent of the base price.\u201d\u201cAt first, I thought it was just a single case, but then I went out and looked around. I discovered that it was not only rice. All the other items in the market are also rising in price. Among them, steel was the most insane. Generally, for 1 kilogram of steel it only costs 1 wen, but now it is 3 wen per 500 grams\u2026 Moreover, if you want to buy bulks of steel, you can\u2019t get that much\u2026 It seems like restrictions have been put in place\u2026\u201d\u201cAll these items are necessary for human survival. To bring this in the big picture\u2026 Unless somebody is suddenly stockpiling goods, the price would never rise like this\u2026 All the kingdoms have been in peace for the past several years. The citizens have been living affluently. Natural and manmade disasters have seldom happened. Yet now the stockpile has suddenly happened. Why? It is obviously nothing else but\u2026\u201dThe steward drank another one and sighed, \u201cWar is coming\u2026\u201d\u201cErh.\u201d Ye Xiao didn\u2019t say a word.\u201cAnother important reason is that\u2026 The House of the Chaotic Storm showed up again!\u201d The steward tittered, \u201cIn three thousand years, the House of the Chaotic Storm has shown up nine times\u2026 Every time it showed up, it led to a change. A change in the situation of the whole land!\u201d\u201cDuring the change, the whole land will be unified, and then the House of the Chaotic Storm will disappear\u2026 Yet no more than a hundred years later, the situation of unification will break down again. At this time, rivaling warlords will battle over the land, which will lead to a situation of fragmentation. And then after some battles, it will turn into several kingdoms\u2026 They will be too fearful to mess with each other so they will be in peace. That is just like the current situation\u2026\u201d\u201cAfter that balanced situation appears, in no more than a 100 years, the House of the Chaotic Storm will show up again. After that\u2026 Everything will start to rise in price\u2026 And then\u2026 War will break out. Until, eventually, one of the kingdoms will rule all the land\u2026\u201d\u201cIt is the ninth time the House of the Chaotic Storm has shown up.\u201d Steward Song finally showed signs of getting drunk on his face, but his eyes were getting clearer, \u201cThe ninth time within the last three thousand years.\u201d\u201cSo that is what it is.\u201d Ye Xiao was enlightened.\u201cAnd the extremely mysterious person, Master Bai, who is nearly someone from a myth, has shown up nine times. Every time, it was Master Bai!\u201d The steward finally cursed, \u201cOther than a legend, I\u2019d rather say he is an immortal monster!\u201dYe Xiao was stunned.\u201cSo that Wan Of The Clouds and Xiu Of The Heavens have also lived for thousands years. Are they not monsters too?\u201d\u201cThey are also monsters! They should all be monsters!\u201d The steward nodded heavily.Ye Xiao felt shocked after hearing that.The steward didn\u2019t know, but Ye Xiao knew that those men in black, who came to the house of Ye the other night, were actually from the House of the Chaotic Storm!Was he going to fight against some monsters this time?If he was the previous Xiao Monarch, they weren\u2019t worth even a second of his time. However, now the roles were reversed. For the House of the Chaotic Storm, Ye Xiao should be equal to an ant!He wasn\u2019t even worthy to be compared with an ant.\u201cSo if the war comes, it must involve the whole world\u2026 As my dad is the Northern General\u2026 Isn\u2019t he going to be the first to be affected?\u201d Ye Xiao asked.When he spoke out \u2018my dad\u2019, he didn\u2019t feel conflicted.A few days earlier, the steward said something to him, \u201cWhen you were born, you had inadequate natural endowment. You were also badly injured because of an accident, and your Jing and Mai were blocked. Your father spent everything to save your life and tried to make you healthy like normal people, but he failed. At the end, the king said that he had a medical material that could save you, but he had a request. He wanted your father to become his sworn brother and guard the northern territory for twenty years!\u201dAt that time, Ye Xiao was only sixteen.That was to say, after spending all his properties, his father had sold the best twenty years of his youth for his son!For such a gesture, even though the one who made it wasn\u2019t his real father, Ye Xiao still felt touched. This was the same kind of feeling that a real son would\u2019ve felt for his father!Speaking of that, Ye Xiao had been an orphan in his previous life. He had been longing for this kind of affection, this parental love, for a long time.This time, he was lucky to have a second life and gain the love he longed for, so he naturally cherished it even more.\u201cThat is not quite so.\u201d The pride showed up in the steward\u2019s eyes, \u201cI believe that in the Land of Han-Yang, there is absolutely no one that could threaten my brother\u2019s life! Even if everyone in this world dies, you father will live well unharmed!\u201dYe Xiao was shocked when he heard that.\u2018There is absolutely no one that could threaten my brother\u2019s life\u2019!\u2018My brother\u2019!He finally knew what had caused his concern: [This Steward Song who has been working as a servant in my house is actually my father\u2019s sworn brother!]However, a sworn brother like Steward Song and a sworn brother like the king were incomparable, as they represented two completely different things to his father.Steward Song must be drunk, so he leaked out something.Ye Xiao didn\u2019t know why, but he suddenly felt like the family he was staying at was filled with mysteries.Besides, why did the steward trust his father so much? Even if he was a top-class superior cultivator in the Grandmaster levels of Tianyuan, dying in a battle of million-men armies wouldn\u2019t be a strange thing, right?Where did such confidence come from?Could his \u2018adopted\u2019 father be much stronger than that? If so, he must be over the cultivation limit of this realm, right? That simply couldn\u2019t be right!The steward was drunk. He laughed with self-mockery, \u201cAhee\u2026 I am drunk. I am actually drunk. I haven\u2019t been drunk in a long time\u2026 You father, my brother strictly forbids me from drinking, but I am so happy today\u2026 So I really want to drink some. Xiao boy, don\u2019t tell your father that I drank. Don\u2019t even think about telling him I am drunk. Do you understand!\u201dYe Xiao was stunned when he heard him.[What the hell. You really can\u2019t reason with a drunk man. He was acting as a servant at the beginning, but now he is admonishing me with the tone of an elder. And he even called me \u2018Xiao boy\u2019, what the hell is that\u2026]Steward Song\u2019s face suddenly turned unusually red and his breath became heavier. After a few slight coughs, he suddenly coughed heavily!After a long time, he lowered his head and turned it around. He spat out something on a handkerchief.Apparently, he didn\u2019t want Ye Xiao to see this.However, although Ye Xiao was not at a high cultivation level, his eyes were as sharp as they used to be in his previous life. He had already seen some of it.His pupils suddenly shrank.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGolden purple!The blood that the steward spat out was actually golden purple blood!\u2014\u2014[1] wen: A unit in the ancient Chinese money system. 1 wen equals 10 li.[2] li: 1 li equals 0.1 wenPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 68 \u2013 The Golden Mai Palm!In fact, the steward hadn\u2019t spat out some regular spit; he had actually spat out some\u2026 Golden purple blood!\u201cThe Golden Mai Palm!\u201dIn Ye Xiao\u2019s mind, the name of this technique emerged; he was astonished.The Golden Mai Palm. Ye Xiao had seen it in his previous life for hundreds of times!Because in his previous life, the Zi-Yang Mount, one of the three factions who had hunted him down, was famous for its Golden Mai Palm!In the Qing-Yun Realm, they were the only group who could use it; there was no others!It was the specialty of the Zi-Yang Mount.The Golden Mai Palm had vigorous and firm palm strength; it was grandly powerful. It could break stones into pieces, but that was just normal. The real horror of this technique was the viciousness hidden inside it.When one was struck by the Golden Mai Palm, the power would sneak into his Jing and Mai like burning fire. It would produce some golden material inside the Jing and Mai. This golden material was like a living thing. It was extremely difficult to dispel. It would infect the energy of the body to strengthen itself, while it would also continue to turn the blood into golden blood. If it didn\u2019t get dispelled soon, in the future, it would lead to severe complications; the victim was almost doomed to die.How could a person live on when all of his organs turned gold?Of course he would die instantly!Steward Song, who was now in front of Ye Xiao, was actually a victim of the Golden Mai Palm, and he had actually endured a feeble existence till now. There were only two explanations for that: First, the one who had attacked him hadn\u2019t cultivated into a higher level of the Golden Mai Palm; the internal injury he had left had been expanding gradually, and now it was overstepping Steward Song\u2019s limit bit by bit.Second, there was some efficacious medicine continuing his life; it was slowing down the organs from becoming golden.However, after being hit by the Golden Mai Palm, if he couldn\u2019t acquire the special antidote, his cultivation would drop slowly because of the infection. Even a great superior cultivator would become an ordinary person who had little strength bit by bit. Once his veins could no longer bear the effect of the Golden Mai Palm, he would die anyway.Yet Steward Song, who was in front of Ye Xiao, had obviously almost reached his limit.Alcohol was the major taboo for whoever was hit by the Golden Mai Palm!Because the golden material that had infected the body would run strangely! Once it ran too strangely, the victim would never have the chance to survive!Yet Steward Song had drunk so much liquor today.Ye Xiao\u2019s eyes lit up and he said, \u201cI felt tired suddenly\u2026 It must be my lack of good rests these days. Uncle Song, how about we call it a day now?\u201dSteward Song nodded but said nothing. What Ye Xiao said was exactly something he needed. To drink more today, he was afraid that he would truly lose control. He was about to spit out blood for the second time soon.Ye Xiao left without any hesitation; he turned around and walked away.\u2026It was midnight.Steward Song\u2019s body was curled-up while lying on his bed. He was covering his mouth as he coughed. In his eyes, there was slight hint of sorrow.[The young lord is sixteen now. That means I have been suffering this injury for sixteen years, right?Finally, I can\u2019t suppress it anymore!In sixteen years, my cultivation have been dropping till. Now, it is getting faster. Last month, I was still in the sixth level of the Grade of Diyuan, yet now, it is first level of the Grade of Diyuan.After drinking so much tonight\u2026 maybe tomorrow it will drop to the Grade of Renyuan. Or maybe I don\u2019t have a tomorrow anymore\u2026]He smiled bitterly and murmured, \u201cThis is my life\u2026 Rising up so high and then falling down rapidly. Heh heh\u2026\u201dHe coughed, and finally spat out some purple golden blood again. He felt his entire body was faint and he could clearly sense that his qi was scattering bit by bit\u2026\u201cI better sleep now\u2026 I don\u2019t have many days like this anymore.\u201d The steward was lying in bed closing his eyes as he murmured, \u201cBrother\u2026 If that day comes, could you come back and watch me go\u2026\u201dWhile thinking about that, a sound suddenly echoed. \u2013 Shoot! \u2013 Somebody entered the room through the window.The steward stood up on the floor right away. Although he was suffering from both injury and tiredness, he didn\u2019t lose his wariness. Before he could sound a warning and alert the guards, he felt someone pressing his shoulder. \u2013 BANG! \u2013 He passed out.Steward Song only had one thought right before he passed out: [This night stalker moves neatly and weirdly, but his cultivation is no higher than level 4 of the Grade of Diyuan. In the noontide of my prosperity, I could blow him to death with just a single breath. Yet now I am in his hand and can do nothing but give myself in\u2026]\u2026Ye Xiao stood by the bed looking at the fainted steward and sighed gently.He reached his hand on the steward\u2019s wrist and operated his martial art to check the steward\u2019s pulse.\u201cAs expected, he was hit by the Golden Mai Palm, and it was the Golden Mai Palm of middle level. Whoever can create such injury, even in the Zi-Yang Mount, he must at least be one of the major disciples\u2026\u201d\u201cAs a conservative estimation, it has been ten years after he was hit by the Golden Mai Palm\u2026\u201dYe Xiao couldn\u2019t help frowning slightly.\u201cIf my cultivation reaches the Grade of Tianyuan at the moment, I can surely cure him. But now\u2026 I lack the power to do so even though I really want to.\u201d Ye Xiao had dealt with the Golden Mai Palm for many times in his previous life, so he certainly knew how to cure it.He knew every way to cure it; even without the special antidote, there were still ample of ways to deal with it.However, this place is not the Qing-Yun Realm; there weren\u2019t any of those required medicines here.Generally, if his cultivation was high enough, he could cure it anyway, but it was not. He was nearly helpless.At present, Steward Song\u2019s cultivation and body conditions had all dropped to their lowest. After no more than half month, he would die. There was not much time left; that was the biggest problem right now!\u201cEven though I will do it with my utmost, it will only slightly improve his situation. Luckily, I have reached level 3 of the Grade of Diyuan after cultivating for 10 days, otherwise, I really could do nothing but helplessly watch him\u2026\u201dYe Xiao frowned. He took out a Pei-Yuan Dan Bead and put it into the steward\u2019s mouth. He made sure the dan bead had been pushed down through his throat. After that, he put his hand on the back of the steward and operated the gelid power to draw out the scorching power of the Golden Mai Palm.Bit by bit, it was being absorbed into his palm.The Zi-Yang Mount was holding the sway over the world with the Golden Mai Palm. It was surely because this technique was shockingly powerful and extremely vicious, but at the same time, it was also because nobody was able to defuse the Golden Mai Palm. Countless sects and countless cultivation masters were trying to resolve the Golden Mai Palm but failed eventually.However, Ye Xiao had fought against the Zi-Yang Mount for many times, so he had coincidently figured out the secret of the Golden Mai Palm. In fact, when the Zi-Yang Mount had tried their best hunting Ye Xiao, it was partly because Ye Xiao had figured out their secret. If he revealed the secret to the public, the Zi-Yang Mount\u2019s power and reputation would absolutely decrease.Whoever was hit by the Golden Mai Palm, those golden material would appear inside his body. Meanwhile, his organs would become golden bit by bit. People all thought that this technique should be attuned with gold attribute. They thought the cultivator could absorb some special metallic materials into the palm and attack with it. Thus, they focused on reducing the golden material and slowing the organ from becoming golden, but they weren\u2019t aware that it was only a camouflage.The Golden Mai Palm was no gold attribute technique at all; it was fire attribute. The golden material, which appeared after the attack, was merely the outcome of the Golden Mai Palm\u2019s power burning the Jing and Mai. Its power would linger around for a long time, transforming the victim\u2019s blood, vigor, and cultivation into its own motive power. If one could not dispel the power of the Golden Mai Palm after being struck, the Golden Mai Palm would continually strengthen itself.As for some superior cultivators who cultivated the Golden Mai Palm, they could instantly make the opponent\u2019s organs become golden with a single strike. It was simply just speeding the process up by countless times. So when people were fixated on eradicating the golden materials and slowing down the process of becoming golden, they failed to realized that these actions would only cure its symptoms; in fact, this was far from the proper treatment.In fact, it was quite a coincidence when Ye Xiao discovered how to deal with the Golden Mai Palm in his previous life. In that day when he came across a man of the Zi-Yang Mount, he was hit by the Golden Mai Palm. After being hit, the injury expanded rather fast, so he tried his best operating the Pure Yang Martial Art to resist it. Coincidently, he found that his Pure Yang Martial Art actually could assimilate the power of the Golden Mai Palm.He was enlightened; he noticed the Golden Mai Palm was a fire attribute technique. When one thing was learned, a hundred similar things would also be uncovered. As long as the major direction was confirmed, it was naturally an easy job to cure it. Since then, Ye Xiao had seized many solutions to resist the Golden Mai Palm.He was weak at the moment and couldn\u2019t cure it efficiently, but he now had a more specific solution than those he had learned in his previous life. The two extremities of ice and fire were the most effective treatment to the Golden Mai Palm. The one with the opposite attribute absorbed, while the one with the same attribute digested. That made a perfect pair!He tested this solution with great caution; he didn\u2019t dare to be reckless. He just absorbed a little bit of the power of the Golden Mai Palm, but surprisingly after the hot power was absorbed and ran around his Jing and Mai, it actually turned into his scorching power \u2013 one of his two extreme powers.Ye Xiao was thrilled.He was surprised that the assimilation went so smoothly; it was even smoother than when he was cultivating the Pure Yang Martial Art. It practically skipped the process of the assimilation. It felt like his scorching power was the ocean and the hot power from the Golden Mai Palm was only a little stream. It was merely the stream flowing into the ocean; it really wasn\u2019t worth mentioning![It turns out dispelling the power of the Golden Mai Palm\u2026 can bring me such a benefit. That is a sweet surprise.]He dared not to neglect it, so he hurried operating the martial art, absorbing the hot power.He didn\u2019t stopped until the moon indicated it was late. He murmured, \u201cThe hot power of the Golden Mai Palm inside the Jing and Mai has been absorbed clean\u2026 But the power that has already gotten into the organs and dantian is impossible to dispel. Not with my current condition\u2026\u201dHe gritted his teeth, took out one of the only two Bone Ablutionary Dan Beads and put it into the steward\u2019s mouth.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAnd then he began to operate the martial art again!When it was dawn, Ye Xiao left quietly.The result of this rescue was better than expected. Although he didn\u2019t cure the disease radically, he had already suppressed the elementary power of the Golden Mai Palm into the deepest place of the steward\u2019s dantian! The hot power of the Golden Mai Palm that was flowing around the steward\u2019s body had all been absorbed by Ye Xiao. There only remained the deeply hidden elementary power which was impossible to dispel.That meant from then on, there would be no more problem with the steward\u2019s body; the injury could never deteriorate.\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He sneered, \u201c\u2026 By then I will need the slightest effort to cure the effect of the Golden Mai Palm!\u201dHe had cured the loyal Steward Song and didn\u2019t expose himself. In fact, he had even improved his cultivation.That was something like \u2018a good man deserved some good luck\u2019, right?!Ye Xiao felt relaxed and sweetly fell asleep, of course, in his own bedroom.\u2026The next morning!The steward slowly woke up.\u201cHmm. It has been a long time since I slept so well! Eh\u2026 I am alive? How come I didn\u2019t die?\u201d The steward felt extremely weird. He hurriedly checked himself, but couldn\u2019t find any sign of a wound.Then he turned over quickly and tried to sit up. However, when he was turning over, he suddenly stopped. This was an extremely awkward position!His eyes showed an expression of astonishment.Because\u2026 He felt that the sickening hot power, which had been running through his Jing and Mai and had tortured him for the last 16 years, had completely vanished!\u2013 PAH! \u2013 The steward immediately heavily slapped himself![This must be a dream. It is always easy to wake up from a good dream. Whether I am dead or not, it is not a good thing to remain in a dream forever. Come on, I need to wake up!]That slap was truly solid and had left a firm mark on his face. He could even count a couple of stars in his vision, as he had nearly hit his teeth out of his mouth.\u201cIt hurts me to death\u2026 Am I actually not dreaming?\u201d The steward touched his cheek and felt the buzz in his ear that was caused by the slap. He instantly regretted his previous action, \u201cWhy did I slap so hard\u2026 Hmm\u2026 That power\u2026\u201dHe tried operating the elemental qi in his dantian. \u2013 Boom!- He felt the spiritual power in his dantian suddenly rose and rushed out like a furious billow!At the moment, the bones of his body were suddenly crackling!His Jing and Mai had been left uncultivated for the past 16 years, yet they had suddenly regained their vigor. They expanded tidily to allow the long lost spiritual power to rush into them. The brisk qi kept rushing out, as all of his hair suddenly stood straight up!\u2013 Pooh! \u2013He opened his mouth and this time, he spat out a true phlegm.He reached his hands and looked at them. His hands were now full of energy\u2026\u201cMiracle! What a miracle!\u201d His hands were shaking while his body was quivering.Suddenly, two streams of tears rolled down his cheeks, \u201cI thought\u2026 I thought there was no hope left for me in this lifetime.

Besides, while cultivating more, my original cultivation will come back to me bit by bit.\u201d\u201cFinally, I, Song Jue, will have the day to enact my revenge!\u201dHis eyes were filled with tears.After a long time, he finally calmed down, \u201cBut\u2026 what is really going on?

If there is anything he wants me to do, then I will make sure to do it.\u201d\u201cHowever, if he asks me to do something against my big brother, I will kill myself right away, returning my life to him.\u201d Song Jue thought so and instantly felt relieved.\u201cHumph! Now that I have recovered a part of my cultivation, while I am guarding the house of Ye, I would like to know what kind of morons would dare to mess with us!\u201dHe humphed through his nose, as he was full of pride!Ever since they had gotten up this morning, the guards of the house of Ye had seen their Master Steward smiling. He usually looked rather sullen, but currently, he was in an exceptionally good mood.They really didn\u2019t know what kind of joyous event had happened to their Master Steward.He tapped on the shoulder of everyone who passed by and chatted with them, he was even full of smiles.It made these old soldiers, who had used to fight between millions of troops and had survived after hundreds of battles, to feel extremely flattered.Some of them even murmured in their minds, \u201cThat killing god\u2026 Has he suddenly lost his mind? He must have woken up without a mind! Why is he so weird\u2026 Is he haunted by ghosts? I think we need to splash some black dog blood [1] on him\u2026 What the hell. His smile gave me goose bumps, it also chilled my backbone. That is exactly what they call thrillingness.\u201dAfter Ye Xiao got up, he washed his face roughly and rushed up to the watchtower to enjoy the power of the East-rising Purple Qi.On a day, the best time for cultivating the East-rising Purple Qi was the early morning when the sun had just started rising.At that moment, the pure yang purple qi around the world would be at its thickest and purest!Certainly, Ye Xiao wouldn\u2019t let that good chance go.When he was preparing to go, the steward had already been waiting for him at the door. He was smiling\u2026 while his face was glowing with a healthy color.Of course, Ye Xiao knew why he was so happy and so aglow. He also knew, that if he was held up by the steward, he would lose the entire morning\u2026\u201cErh\u2026 I, I, I\u2026 I am ur that those wow hahaha *&)) [email\u00a0protected] (&^\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao talked balderdash and rushed by the steward like the wind. He ran towards the watchtower before the steward was able to utter a single word.\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d The steward rubbed his head. He was puzzled by Ye Xiao\u2019s actions.\u2026When Ye Xiao got down from the watchtower, the steward rushed forward, \u201cMy lord, something is wrong. Something has happened in the south.\u201d\u201cThe south?\u201d Ye Xiao was a bit shocked. He thought that the steward was about to tell him about the recovery of his cultivation, however, something about the south had suddenly popped up. His father was the Northern General, so he didn\u2019t understand why the south would matter to the house of Ye.\u201cThe war has begun in the south. The report arrived at the capital this morning. The battle started five days ago\u2026\u201d The steward frowned, \u201cThis time, the Southern Barbarians and the Kingdom of Jin-Yang are cooperating\u2026 I am afraid that General Lan is in danger.\u201d\u201cGeneral Lan? Lan Lang-Lang\u2019s father?\u201d Ye Xiao frowned.[I see. It is about the Lord Lan\u2019s father. I suppose, that that does matter to me somehow.]\u201cYes, the battle suddenly bursted out\u2026 General Lan was unprepared. He is nearly surrounded from three directions. He is now in a terrible situation.\u201d The steward frowned, \u201cIt all depends on the king\u2019s decision now\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat about the north?\u201d Ye Xiao asked.\u201cThe great general is there. It is as stable as a mountain!\u201d The steward raised his head proudly.\u201cAhem\u2026\u201dYe Xiao sighed.[How on earth did this sightless confidence develop?]\u201cEven though something weird has happened in the south, there is nothing we can do to help, right\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao spoke strangely, \u201cCould I be recruited to the battlefield? That couldn\u2019t be possible, right?\u201dThe steward was left speechless, and at the same time, he was slightly amused.[I believe the king would rather send ten thousand rats to battle than you, the foppish young lord!]\u201cIt is not that.\u201d The steward twitched his mouth a bit and said, \u201cThe current situation is, besides the main force of the royal court, there is only one group that can be deployed\u2026 But if these men leave for battle, our situation will become very dangerous. So I think I need to warn you about it.\u201d\u201cOh? Men from where? Are they really so close to us?\u201d Ye Xiao asked.\u201cThey belong to Prince Hua-Yang!\u201d The steward spoke in a deep voice, \u201cThis battle concerns the life and death of this kingdom. Now that General Lan can\u2019t save the situation on his own. There is only one man who can save it. That is the No.1 in the military of the Kingdom of Chen \u2013 the Military God of Chen, Prince Hua-Yang!\u201d\u201cGeneral Ye has been guarding the north throughout the years. All of his families and his soldiers are all in the capital, including us. It is the same with General Lan. We are all under the watch of Prince Hua-Yang\u2026 If he really leaves for battle, then in the next period of time, when someone breaks the balance of the royal power, families of the military forces will become the disadvantaged groups\u2026\u201dYe Xiao was shocked. Prince Hua-Yang, father of Su Ye-Yue, prospective father-in-law of Ye Xiao. It was said that he was a big fellow. Ye Xiao didn\u2019t know that all the families of the military were living under his favor!If so, this Prince Hua-Yang, the Military God of Chen was really an honest man. Ye Xiao\u2019s heart became filled with respect for this man.\u201cSo, during these days, you better don\u2019t go out, in case you fall in trouble once again.\u201d The steward had talked for such a long time before he finally arrived at this point.\u201cSo it is like this. I see.\u201d Ye Xiao felt relieved and boasted clapping his chest, \u201cUncle Song, don\u2019t worry! I have been greatly awakened these days. I will definitely stay safe and sound here at home. I would never get into any kind of trouble!\u201dSong Jue\u2019s mouth twitched again.Hearing this, he suddenly felt pain in his balls [2].[That little prick really dares to broast.

    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 70 \u2013 Assassination On The Street\u201cI couldn\u2019t discipline you before. I wanted to, but was unable.\u201d The steward threatened, \u201cBut from now on, if you dare to run wild again, I will spank your ass to pieces. You tell me whether I dare to or not!\u201dThat was spoken in a fierce tone.That was no longer the tone of a steward talking to his master; it was the tone of an uncle talking to his nephew.Apparently, when Song Jue was weak, he felt that he was incapable of protecting Ye Xiao and couldn\u2019t be someone he could depend on. He felt that he didn\u2019t deserve the title of \u2018uncle\u2019, so he just let Ye Xiao do whatever he wanted.But right now, Steward Song\u2019s cultivation had returned. He felt that he had become freaking awesome![If anyone dares to mess with my nephew, I will kill him!]The enormous self-confidence he lost in the recent years had returned.\u2018I wanted to, but was unable\u2019 perfectly described the sentiments he felt deep within his heart.Now that he wanted to and was completely capable of fulfilling his duties, naturally, he would make up for what he had failed to do in the past, including protecting Ye Xiao, be the one he could rely on and of course, disciplining him!Ye Xiao laughed and said, \u201cUncle Song. Please relax. Am I the kind of person who keeps on making trouble?\u201dThe steward rolled his eyes.[How come this sounds so familiar? Damn it. He said the same words again!If you are not the kind who keeps on making trouble\u2026 then who on earth is?You are certainly the ancestor of that sort!You are a demon who keeps on making trouble!]\u2026Ye Xiao was holding on to a massive amount of money at the moment. He was totally a rich guy. He couldn\u2019t suppress the urge to spend money anymore, so he rushed out anyway. This time, he specifically went to the place where metallic materials were being sold\u2026Since the price of metal was currently on the rise, he would have to pay a high price if he wanted to buy anything. But he also understood something else: usually, precisely when everything was rising in value that rare items show up!The reason why the businessmen hoarded goods was to gain maximum profits during such times!Thus, this time when Ye Xiao went out, he brought all his savings with him.He was shopping crazily across the entire street!But apparently,the results of his shopping spree wasn\u2019t satisfactory. Although he had spent almost 200 thousand silver bars, the amount of items in the Gold Space only increased by a small amount. They weighed less than 2.5 kilograms.This result made Ye Xiao depressed. Those so called \u2018Soul of Irons\u2019, \u2018Hundred-tempered Steel\u2019, \u2019Stone from The Heaven\u2019\u2026 They had powerful names, each scarier than last, but the essence absorbed from them was almost negligible.Even the lot of them together could only release a tiny amount of metallic qi\u2026What a massive waste of resources!After the shopping, the monarch\u2019s face was filled with impatience as he walked aimlessly around the marketplace. If it wasn\u2019t for the sun that was brightly shining down on him, warming his body and slightly increasing the power of the East-Rising Purple Qi, he would have most likely flipped out by now.[I had come out with great hope.But after spending thousands, I only got such a small gain?Is it because I have received too much these past few days that I have spent all my luck?!]While thinking of nonsense and mixing with the crowd, he noticed that the crowd was quickly becoming denser. It seemed like there were lots of people rushing in.He frowned and looked towards the street corner.[How come so many people are crowding over there?]At the street corner, a carriage had arrived, bearing a sign which read \u2018Divine Arms Mill\u2019!It was not a small carriage at all, but it wasn\u2019t big enough to cause the street to become congested either. However, there were lots of people surrounding the carriage with eager looks and burning eyes.Those people who were surrounding the carriage were all cultivators. Some of them were citizens of the martial world, some of them were government officers, and some of them were well-dressed \u2013 they must be the men of the noble clans\u2026Divine Arms Mill!The No.1 weapon producer in the Land of Han-Yang!According to the tales, among the top-ten legendary swords in the Land of Han-Yang, six were produced by the Divine Arms Mill!These famous weapons could cut through iron as if it was mud!They could easily chop through gold and jade!Since the Divine Arms Mill had arrived at the capital, it was no surprise that it had aroused a commotion!Ye Xiao\u2019s eyes lit up and he thought, [It is fine that I haven\u2019t found any decent metallic material. Since I don\u2019t have a proper weapon at the moment, if I can buy a good sword to become my temporary weapon, then that would be good.]So he followed the crowd walking towards the Divine Arms Mill.In Ye Xiao\u2019s eyes, even if he could get a top-quality weapon in the Land of Han-Yang, it wouldn\u2019t be worthy of being held in his hands. He would only use it temporarily. When an opportunity would arise, he would definitely replace it.While he walked, he suddenly felt a killing intent fiercely smashing against his body. A serious danger was rapidly approaching him from all directions![Assassins?!]Ye Xiao was astonished.[Under the light of the day, on a nearly impenetrable street that is densely crowded, I am actually encountering an assassination squad!] Ye Xiao collected his thoughts quickly: [Coming out here was a completely random idea. How long have these assassins been stalking me?]He had no doubt that this was a long-term assassination plan!Four waves of cold wind approached from his front, back, left and right!They were like poisonous snakes hiding in the grass, charging like lightning through the crowd.This was a perfect killing trap.Ye Xiao confirmed the targets with only a single glance. There were four men; all dressed in grey ordinary cultivator suits. They were inconspicuous. In fact\u2026 when the Divine Arms Mill arrived, Ye Xiao happened to be here shopping\u2026[It must have nothing to do with the Divine Arms Mill, because they definitely had no idea that I would be here. The only possibility is that someone has been planning on dealing with me for some time!Who might it be?]The danger was quickly closing in on him. Finally, four cold beams of light were revealed under their clothes, before simultaneously shooting towards him.They were aiming at the his chest, the back, the left subcostal and the right subcostal\u2026Four men, in the cover of the noisy crowd, attacked him fiercely at the same time!Four swords, all filled with killing intent!Such clever tactics; such a ruthless assault! In this world, if it was used against an ordinary cultivator of the Grade of Diyuan, even if he was at level 6, it would have definitely succeeded.The eyes of the four assassins were filled with cruelty and the satisfaction of success. In their eyes, the Ye Xiao was already a dead man!It was impossible for him to escape this attack.A sneer showed up on the corner of Ye Xiao\u2019s mouth. He lowered his head and rapidly stepped forward. And then he leaned towards his side. The four swords stabbed into his body at the same time. \u2013 SWISH!-The front, the back, the left and the right. The strange thing was that\u2026 the four swords all went through the gap between his skin and the clothes. They made eight holes in his clothes!Yet his body was totally unharmed!How skillful!It was as if his body was being held up by the four swords, but the deadly sharp blades were unable to make a single cut on his skin!Before the four men were able to notice that, Ye Xiao had already reached out his hand and gripped the wrist of the man in front of him. And then as he squeezed, the gelid power suddenly controlled the entire body of the man; the man couldn\u2019t even open his mouth.The very next moment, three thin ice knives flew out without a trace.The three men who were on the left, the right and the back of Ye Xiao felt a pleasant coolness before they suddenly stopped their rushing bodies. Their eyes were filled with disbelief.Ever so slowly, their bodies started to collapse onto the ground.Ye Xiao always knew how this fight would end. He didn\u2019t even look back. He just shook his body and the four swords silently returned. They flew back into the clothes of the four guys, exactly where they had previously hidden their weapons.He didn\u2019t just stop there; he held up the man in front of him. The four holes on his clothes, which was made from fine silk, were totally unnoticeable.He casually held up the guy in front of him and blew on top of his head. And then, the man\u2019s hair became grey\u2026It almost seemed like he had turned into someone else, as both of them seemed to be whispering with lowered heads. They almost resembled two close friends, who were happily conversing with each other, before unhurriedly departing from the crowd\u2026The way they departed seemed leisurely and elegant.Behind them, people were shouting, \u201cDon\u2019t push! Don\u2019t push, all of you! The Divine Arms Mill is right there. They are not going to run away\u2026 Just bring enough money. Pushing and squeezing won\u2019t help anyway if you don\u2019t have the money\u2026\u201dThe three dead bodies hadn\u2019t actually fallen on the floor yet; they were still in the process of falling.Finally\u2026-POOF!-One of the bodies fell to the ground.\u201cDon\u2019t push already! Someone fell down\u2026\u201d People shouted.\u201cAnother one fell\u2026 Damn it! I told you not to push\u2026 Don\u2019t step on people\u2026\u201d\u201cWith such weak body strength, he actually squeezed in here to buy divine weapons. For what?\u201d\u201cExactly! Exactly\u2026\u201dWhen people were complaining disdainfully, one of them noticed that none of the three men actually were attempting to get back up, they didn\u2019t even struggle! So he reached his hand out to check their pulse, but he failed to find one, as the bodies had already turned cold. He suddenly quivered and nearly passed out from fear. He cried with a voice that sounded inhuman, \u201cArh arh arh\u2026 Death\u2026 There are three men that have been pushed to death\u2026\u201d\u201cYou are spouting fxxking nonsense. I have seen situations much worse than today and people didn\u2019t die being pushed.\u201d\u201cEh\u2026 Arh arh\u2026 They are dead for real\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat the hell! How come these three fellas stopped breathing? Are they really dead\u2026\u201dAfter knowing there were dead men amongst them, \u2013 Shoot! \u2013 the crowd scattered. Suddenly, an empty circle formed within the crowd. Three men curled up on the floor. There were no wounds on their bodies, yet they didn\u2019t breathe.It somehow looked like they were dead because of being pushed too heavily.When that scene was revealed, people felt frightened. \u2013 Shraff!- In an instant, people dispersed like the receding tide. [Shit! It is acceptable that I failed to buy some weapon, but hell no, don\u2019t get me in a lawsuit. We are in the capital right now\u2026]\u201cNone of my business\u2026\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t push at all\u2026\u201d\u201cOh shoot, somebody died for real.\u201d\u201cWhat the hell. Were they made from bean dregs? Really? Died from being pushed?\u201d\u201cScared the shit out of me. Better hurry off.\u201d\u201cI still want a divine weapon\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou want shit! The officers are coming right away. If you get caught, even if you don\u2019t die, three layers of your skin will be ripped off! Hurry up!\u201d\u201cHurry. Don\u2019t get me involve this shit hole\u2026\u201d\u201cGosh\u2026\u201dWithin seconds, all the people on the street had seemingly vanished. The entire street had suddenly become desolate\u2026 Except for the three bodies, who remained crooked in their original postures\u2026No signs of wounds; no stain of blood.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 71 \u2013 The Flame In The HeartThe two shops near the dead bodies were truly unlucky. The shopkeepers\u2019 faces turned green when they saw what had just happened. But no matter what, they had no chance of escaping this scenario.This was really a case of \u2018he who stayed in the house was hit by the misfortune from the sky\u2019 [1]. They were simply running their businesses as usual, but to their surprise, people just died in front of their doorsteps.However, people of the Divine Arms Mill were far more pissed off than they were.They had brought some divine weapons to the capital and caused quite a sensation, attracting a lot of followers as they had expected!They believed that this time, they could sell them for an exorbitant price! They could sense the excitement of the crowd\u2026There was no doubt that they had made a good decision to show up at that moment.However, just as they were becoming complacent and elated\u2026Suddenly, three men in the crowd who had been following them had just died!That was seriously some bad luck!Their faces immediately turned green![That is fxxking so\u2026 so\u2026 so, so\u2026 What the hell\u2026]Watching the crowd scatter and leave the place, all of the expert cultivators of the Divine Arms Mill were stunned.They couldn\u2019t help but come up with a common thought \u2014 [Will the death of these guys\u2026 get us involved?]\u2026Under the cover of the chaos, Ye Xiao was dragging that man as he leisurely went into a small alley. He climbed over two walls and casually kicked a hole in it. After he passed through the wall, he kicked it once more, returning it to how it was before.He finally found a secluded place, where he placed the man on the ground.The man hadn\u2019t made any sound or movement, but he had kept on observing everything that Ye Xiao had done, from easily killing the other three assassins to dragging him away as if nothing had happened, and then bringing him to a secluded place\u2026The boldness, precision, wariness, cruelness and strength that Ye Xiao had shown\u2026 was really shocking.Thus, when Ye Xiao placed him on the ground, the guy\u2019s face was already pale and filled with fear.When he finally dropped to the floor, he was finally freed from being frozen. Just as he started to recover, he quickly opened his mouth\u2026 and then fiercely snapped it shut. Apparently, he was trying to commit suicide by biting his tongue off.Analyzing Ye Xiao\u2019s actions, he decided that it would be a blessing if he could just kill himself after being captured! It would be better to die quickly than suffer.Ye Xiao reached out an arm and casually broke the guy\u2019s lower jaw. He said, \u201cYou want to die? You know it can\u2019t be this easy, right?\u201dAnd then he blocked the guy\u2019s Jing and Mai. He held the guy\u2019s lower jaw up to his mouth and then touched the guy\u2019s cheek with his finger. A stream of gelid power had instantly frozen the guy\u2019s facial muscles.\u201cNow, you should only be able to speak in whispers. You certainly cannot shout. You are free to try if you don\u2019t believe me.\u201d Ye Xiao spoke gently, \u201cAnd, to kill yourself by biting your tongue requires certain strength, but unfortunately, you hardly have the strength to do so. You can at most blink. Things like cutting off your own Jing and Mai, exploding your dantian\u2026 Oh you don\u2019t have those abilities now, am I right? Even if you do, it is impossible to execute those moves in front of me!\u201d\u201cWell, I talked a lot with you. I just want to tell you that even though you so desperately want to die right now, you just can\u2019t.\u201d Ye Xiao smiled gently, \u201cSee how kindly I treat you. This is just so meticulous.\u201dThe guy couldn\u2019t prevent his body from quivering.His face was filled with extreme fear.[Is this demon really that foppish black sheep of the Ye Clan?Who the\u2026 Who the fxxk collected that bullshit information?]The guy nearly cried out: [Since such a terrible monster could be called a foppish black sheep\u2026 are you telling me that all the foppish lads in the world are monsters too?]Ye Xiao wore a smile on his face, but he was actually rather furious.The four men had actually tried to kill him on the street without even caring that they were in public. They were so brazen and unscrupulous.They didn\u2019t care about hurting innocent people\u2026The anger inside Ye Xiao had reached its pinnacle.Dealing with men who disregarded innocent lives, the Xiao Monarch never showed mercy!\u201cNow you are absolutely not going to die, but you cannot live well either, because I won\u2019t let garbage like you live well.\u201d Ye Xiao spoke frankly, \u201cWell, there are many methods in the world that could force a man to tell something he doesn\u2019t want to. Do you know what those methods are?\u201dThe man lied on the floor, looking at Ye Xiao, absolutely terrified.\u201cI guess you don\u2019t know any more than I do.\u201d Ye Xiao sighed, \u201cThere are so many methods to make people beg for death\u2026 Today you met me. Now you can enjoy these methods from the bottom of your heart. You are lucky, because you are going to experience something most of the human beings wouldn\u2019t be able to experience.\u201dThe man\u2019s eyes were begging for mercy and he only had a sliver of hope: [Oh God! Please! He must be exaggerating!]Ye Xiao sighed, \u201cDon\u2019t even think for a moment that I am boasting. Such methods, I really know a lot. And\u2026 I know a lot more than those executioners do. So, you are really lucky, because in the history of this world, there has never been a man who has experienced all the 108 brutal torture methods!\u201dHe smiled, \u201cOf course you are unlucky at the same time, because these tortures hurt really, really bad. It can\u2019t be explained just by speaking. Let\u2019s go ahead and make you taste each and every one of them. Now we begin with the first, the Flame in the Heart.\u201dAnd then he reached out his hand, very slowly.He didn\u2019t speak any other words at all.Everything about this assassination including who was behind it, who planned it, who wanted to kill him\u2026He asked none of those questions.He just started with the torture.He acted like these details didn\u2019t interest him in the least and the only thing that he was interested in was torturing!Under the fearful look of the man, a flame suddenly appeared in Ye Xiao\u2019s hand. \u2013 Poof! \u2013 It was burning in Ye Xiao\u2019s hand.Ye Xiao explained patiently, \u201cLook, this is fire. However, this fire is no ordinary fire\u2026 Because it can\u2019t burn anything\u2026 If you don\u2019t believe me, just look.\u201dYe Xiao moved the flame to his own clothes, and then to his hair. There was no trace of burning.\u201cOf course, this fire is not completely useless. It\u2019s usage lies in the fact\u2026 that it can enter a man\u2019s mouth and move to his belly bit by bit\u2026 and then it will burn the man\u2019s heart\u2026 Hmm. No, I was wrong. It is not burning. It is roasting. While your heart still beats\u2026 it will kept on roasting it. But it won\u2019t kill you. I can only say that it is a strange feeling\u2026 Right. Why don\u2019t you try it.\u201d\u201cBe proud as the first man who can experience such feeling. How admirable.\u201d Ye Xiao praised.The man\u2019s eyes were already dull. His pupils were nearly dilated. He was shaking because of fear. A terrible stench was spreading out from the lower part of his body.\u201cDon\u2019t fart. That is not civilized.\u201d Ye Xiao reprimanded, \u201cDidn\u2019t your daddy teach you that?\u201d He then hit him with a finger and had actually blocked his acupoint of excretion. And then he pulled up the man\u2019s head and pushed the flame into his mouth.\u201cNew new new n\u2026\u201d The man kept shaking his head. He struggled with faint efforts. He had tried his best but realized that he could only draw out a tiny amount of strength. The words of begging, \u2018no no no no\u2019 had actually became \u2018new new new n\u2026\u2019 due to excessive shivering\u2026The flame had been delivered into his mouth and he really didn\u2019t feel burned at all. There was only a warm feeling of heat slowly moving toward his belly. He actually felt comfortable.Ye Xiao spoke blandly, \u201cFeel anything? Hm, now it has entered the mouth\u2026 It isn\u2019t scorching, is it? It is even comfortable, right? It should have reached the throat right about now\u2026 Not burning either, right? Now it has passed the throat\u2026 Hot? It isn\u2019t hot, right? Now it gets to the chest\u2026 Not hot either, right? I didn\u2019t lie to you, did I? Now it gets to the heart\u2026 And then, ahem\u2026 What about now?\u201dHe hadn\u2019t even finished talking, and then the man felt a rushing stream of heat coming up from underneath his heart!Suddenly, he felt like his heart was slowly being roasted. That terrible feeling was nothing that could be described by any language. Even though his body was thoroughly restricted, he still widely opened his mouth, wishing to cry out loudly.Ye Xiao slowly covered his mouth with one hand, and waved one finger of the other, \u201cBe good. Don\u2019t shout. Don\u2019t become excited. Feel it slowly. Take it easy. No need to rush.\u201dThe man\u2019s head was shaking intensely, but he couldn\u2019t get rid of Ye Xiao\u2019s hand. He couldn\u2019t make any sound. His eyes looked like there was fire burning inside them.The entire Jing and Mai of his body were twitching at the same time. Blue veins stood out all over his body and then fell back the next moment\u2026A large amount of sweat was released, immediately drenching his clothes.It could be seen that the pain he was experiencing was excruciating.\u201cI\u2026 I will talk\u2026 Please\u2026 Stop\u2026\u201d The man finally broke down. He begged repeatedly, looking at Ye Xiao with pleading eyes.\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Ye Xiao frowned, \u201cDon\u2019t you realize, I don\u2019t really want to know anything from you\u2026 Whether you talk or not, it doesn\u2019t matter to me at all. You know that, right? Otherwise, I would have asked you, but I didn\u2019t. Don\u2019t you feel it strange?\u201dThe man looked at him, pleading. His eyes had turned red because of anxiousness.Ye Xiao sighed, \u201cFine. Fine. You looked so pathetic\u2026 All right then, I will let you say something. But I need to clarify something first\u2026 I won\u2019t spare your life. You must think about that clearly. In fact, you can keep your mouth shut and I would like to enjoy seeing you being tortured.\u201dThe man sincerely nodded. His forehead was drenched as he spoke, \u201cI will tell you everything. All I ask you is to let me die quickly\u2026\u201dSpeaking so quickly, he realized that his body had nearly dried out because of the flame. After saying just one sentence, his throat had already bled.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euYe Xiao waved his hand and the flame instantly went back to his hand. It was pulsating slightly. Ye Xiao spoke blandly, \u201cWho sent you here?\u201d\u201cIt was the crown princess! The crown princess\u2026\u201d Sweat trickled down his forehead as his face cramped up, creating a ferocious expression. He shouted loudly since he couldn\u2019t wait to tell the truth, but his voice was hoarse and was barely audible.\u2026\u2014\u2014[1]\u2019He who stayed in the house was hit by the misfortune from the sky\u2019- It is not a Chinese saying.

Who are you? Are you from the Mu Clan?\u201d Ye Xiao asked.\u201cNo\u2026 We are the guards of the east royal palace. The four of us\u2026\u201d The man spoke with great difficulty. He felt the pain intensify, so he groaned, \u201cPlease\u2026 spare me\u2026 a quick death\u2026\u201dYe Xiao\u2019s eyes showed fierceness and spoke blandly, \u201cThe crown princess\u2026 The guards of the east royal palace\u2026\u201d\u2026Ye Xiao questioned him three more times to make sure that he was not being lied to.He walked out of the covert.On the floor of the area he vacated, the guard silently lay. The corners of his mouth showed a smile which implied \u2018final relief\u2019.There seemed to be a sense of gratitude\u2026It seemed that dying was a blessing to him.It looked like nothing had happened. Not even a single trace of them could be found. However, a vigorous man just disappeared forever\u2026\u201cThe Crown Prince\u2019s Palace. The crown princess.\u201d Ye Xiao was walking casually with a beaming face, but these words were lingering inside his mind.He suddenly came up with a bold idea: [Why not sneak into the Crown Prince\u2019s Palace and kill the lousy couple?]\u2026When he walked back to the street, he looked leisurely. He was pleased, as if he was enjoying the spring breeze. He acted like\u2026 he had been pacing around and had never left at all\u2026Even someone who had been trying to keep watch on him would have been fooled: [The young lord has been hanging around on this street buying stuff and has never left\u2026 Now he is still here\u2026But how did three of us die?And most importantly, one is missing?Is he alive or dead? Where is he?]Soon, people from the government arrived. After some sort of investigation process, they took the three dead bodies and left. The other people who were involved were taken with them for interrogation. Among them, there were of course the shopkeepers around the crime scene.After what happened, people on the street had already gotten away cleanly, except for people like these shopkeepers who had been forced to stay. Although they hadn\u2019t even approached the bodies, they could not get away from it. Since people had died in front of their doorsteps, they were surely involved!These men had their cheeks turned sour. The unexpected disaster was inexplicable for them; it was simply a sudden misfortune.There were twelve people in the group of the Divine Arms Mill and six of them were taken to assist the investigation.Because the Divine Arms Mill had great influence and wished to have some of their men to remain in order to guard the divine weapons, only six of them were taken. If it held slightly lesser influence, all the twelve of them would have been seized and even those weapons would have been confiscated. Well, as for how they would be confiscated, the opinions might differ\u2026Ye Xiao was still hanging around casually. Walking and walking, and after a while, he walked into the house of the Divine Arms Mill.After the homicide case, people on the street disappeared immediately. In the Divine Arms Mill that used to be busier than the market, there was only one guest at the moment, the lord Ye!The shopkeeper of the Divine Arms Mill was just lamenting about this misfortune. He had sent men to collect information from the government offices and tried to use some connections for this event to bribe people in power, but then he suddenly saw a guest come in, so he was stunned for a second. His professionalism made him instantly ask, \u201cThe\u2026 The young lord. What do you need?\u201dHe had been through the shock of the government people, so he was somehow like a trembling bird at the moment. But unexpectedly, he saw a guest enter the house, so he was more or less surprised.Ye Xiao waved his hand casually, \u201cYou are asking nonsense. Could I come to a weapon shop for a pen and paper? Any good blade? Good sword? Good weapon? Good iron? Take them all out.\u201d When speaking, he patted himself on the chest, \u201cYou are lucky today. I am full of money!\u201dThe shopkeeper who was stroking his beard was stunned.All those who had ever seeked weapons in the Divine Arms Mill had always acted humbly. Even though the traces were fair, all the customers would say the word \u2018please\u2019 as if they were begging. Among those who were seeking divine weapons, this guy who spoke louder because of his wealth was truly rarely seen for the shopkeeper![Don\u2019t you know that you may be overcharged by saying that? And despite of that, you might even fail to get the items that suits your desire?!]\u201cMay I ask what exactly do you want? Is it a sword or a knife for self-defense, or is it a pike or a halberd that can be used in the big battles? Or maybe it is a small and delicate\u2026 weapon that could be hidden with you all the time?\u201dThe shopkeeper saw him as a fool, so he had to guide Ye Xiao.The other people were still in shock, so he had to do it himself this time.\u201cThe big weapons are not my type, so I shall not take any. Give me two knives and two sword. I want the best. The ones that can chop iron like it was mud. And\u2026 those small ones like throwing knife and needle\u2026 give me some. Those that can also chop iron like mud.\u201d Ye Xiao waved his hand.The shopkeeper couldn\u2019t help twitching his mouth. In his mind, he had a desire of kicking this guy out.[Are you capable of purchasing or not?Even though you are a moron, you are not supposed to let yourself be easily overcharged.\u2018Chop irons like mud\u2019, do you even know any sayings other than this? Do you think it could be used to describe the tiny throwing knife and needle? If those expendable weapons are not custom-made, do you think we would use special materials to make them?]Suppressing the anger in his heart, he brought up two middle-class swords.[He must be a foppish useless lord\u2026 It would be a waste to give him any real precious swords.]\u201cWhat the hell are these?\u201d Ye Xiao picked up one sword. He held the nose of the sword with two fingers of one hand and the blade of the sword with two fingers of the other hand, and then he casually folded it.The sword became bent. When the blade was bent, it started to make cracking sounds. Ye Xiao immediately loosened his grip and said, \u201cThis sword sucks! The other one must be of the same quality. The elasticity and the ductility are both below average. I just bent it slightly, and it turned out like that. What garbage!\u201dThe shopkeeper was stunned.[The swords I just took out are some middle-class swords indeed, but ordinary people can never do something like what he did. Bend the sword using only four fingers? He was actually a superior master?]Thinking about that, the shopkeeper became flustered and started sweating. He then brought up some top-class weapons in a hurry.Ye Xiao looked at one and shook his head, and then another and shook his head again. One after another, he kept rejecting the sword, with disappointment on his face.\u201cMore?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThe name of the Divine Arms Mill shocks the capital. However, as I see today, you are not deserving of such a great reputation. Yet you claim to be the Divine Arms Mill?\u201d Ye Xiao frowned and looked at him asquint with disdain, \u201cSuch scrap metal\u2026 They are only a little bit better than the kitchen knife of my house\u2026 They really dishonor the word \u2018divine\u2019!\u201dThe shopkeeper was a bit pissed when hearing that, \u201cSir! All the weapons in my shop are made by the true Divine Arms Mill. Even though you are aiming very high and cannot appreciate them, my weapons have never disappointed anyone except you.\u201dThe shopkeeper\u2019s words were neither humble nor pushy. He didn\u2019t offend Ye Xiao, but also didn\u2019t depreciate himself. He was truly open-minded!Ye Xiao curled his lips and picked up one sword casually, \u201cProper goods for distinguishedguests. There are some words I didn\u2019t want to say. Let\u2019s talk about this sword. There is the pattern of clouds engraved on it and spiritual lights hidden inside. It is made from well tempered steel. The blade itself gives off a scary aura. It shines in the light. To speak of the appearance of a weapon, it looks as if it is the king of weapons. I guess that this must be the favorite work of your shop, right?\u201dThe shopkeeper raised his head and answered proudly, \u201cYes. The sword is named \u2018The Sword of King\u2019!\u201d\u201cPah!\u201d Ye Xiao made the sound of spitting and said, \u201cThis sword holds too much focus on the appearance. Yet, its essence is flawed. It has been tempered hundreds of times, so it is very sharp indeed, but it has lost its essence and connotation as a sword. Against someone with an ordinary weapon, it would be fine to use this, as it would be able to chop through iron as if it were mud. However, if facing off against some real cultivators\u2026 The weapons of the cultivators, especially those well-known cultivators, could they be ordinary weapons? Within less than three times of crashing, this sword of yours will be rolled up on the edge. This is its first failing. Seeking sharpness recklessly has lead to its thin blade.\u201d\u201cSecond, seeking the pinnacle of lightness makes it too light. It nearly has no weight. Lightness is good for a sword, but even \u2018four ounces yields 1000 catties\u2019[1] requires four ounces at least. This sword obviously fails. When it is pushed to a certain extent, it will break. The sword is too fragile. That is its second failing.\u201d\u201cThird, after too much tempering, there has been many impurity mixed into the metal. It looks perfect on the outside, but in fact, the impurity contained inside is impossible to be removed. How could such a sword be called a divine weapon!\u201dYe Xiao sneered, \u201cA sword with impurity, with the impurity completely mixed into the material of the sword, will never respond to the owner\u2019s mind. No matter how much blood it will be fed, it will still be nothing!\u201d\u201cThis sword is nothing but a \u2018pretty\u2019 ordinary metal. Yet you actually call it a divine weapon\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao smiled blandly, \u201cIt really is unqualified! Every cultivator, especially a superior cultivator, when he wants to buy a weapon, prepares to carry it for his entire life. It will become his vital partner\u2026 Because they will grow bonds with their weapons\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why there is a saying \u2018to live when the sword rises; to die when the sword falls\u2019.\u201d Ye Xiao spoke, \u201cThat is\u2026 When a sword grows a bond with the soul of the man who holds it, if the sword could not bear the strike, neither could the man; he would die! So, it is not a simple oath, it is a fact!\u201dYe Xiao smiled coldly with his hands on his back, \u201cI have talked that much. I just want to tell you that if this sword is your best work\u2026 Then I can be sure that cultivators at the Grade of Tianyuan carry no weapons of yours!\u201d\u201cBecause at that very level, they no longer seek for the sharpness of the weapon, they seek for the bond between the weapons and their souls.\u201dYe Xiao sighed disappointedly, \u201cIt turns out the well-known Divine Arms Mill is just of this level\u2026 It seems I have come to a wrong place today.\u201dAfter speaking, he shook his head and turned, preparing to leave.\u201cHold on a second, sir!\u201d\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu[1] \u2018four ounces yields 1000 catties\u2019\uff08\u56db\u4e24\u62e8\u5343\u65a4), means a huge return for a very small investment; a big payoff for a small effort.\u2026This is the first guaranteed chapter of the week.Translated by: Yu ZhnEdited by: Alpha, ArchPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 73 \u2013 Divine Weapon With Demonic Edge!The shopkeeper continuously nodded as he listened to Ye Xiao speak about the sword. His face looked indifferent at the beginning, but after a while, it became sincerely moved. When he saw Ye Xiao was preparing to leave, he immediately asked him to stay, \u201cPlease stay, sir. You have spoken like a true swordsman. We have proper goods for distinguished guests. Only distinguished people can see the most precious items. To be honest, these weapons here that we put in our showcase are only for ostentation. We just use them to impress some outsiders. As for the real divine weapons\u2026 How could we just show them here in front of the public? You are a distinguished man, sir. Since you are seeking weapons with sincerity, may I lead you to our secret storage?\u201dYe Xiao\u2019s eyes lit up and he said, \u201cI said the Divine Arms Mill was better heard than seen. It turns out that there are some secrets within it. Ok. That\u2019s fine.\u201dIn his mind he said, [I knew that you guys are not dishonest.You would never show me the real deal if you didn\u2019t get scolded.]They both walked to the back of the shop.A big fellow in cyan robes opened a hidden door for them and then another big fellow in white robes opened another hidden door. After passing through, the door to the secret storage was revealed.The shopkeeper unlocked the door himself and walked in with Ye Xiao. The doors were closed immediately. Several superior cultivators came and stood outside the doors.It is obvious that the security here was extremely rigorous.After entering the secret storage, what came in sight was a spacious room. Weapons were hung or leaned on three walls.There were only three weapons!On the wall in front was a sword, on the wall on the left was a knife and on the right was a spear! There was a small chest on the floor by the right wall, and on the other side, there were some unimpressive metal.The sword and the knife were sheathed, while the spear handle was placed on the floor and its blade leaned on the wall. It resembled a king looking down upon the world.\u201cWell, at least weapons here are fine enough to enter my sight.\u201d Ye Xiao nodded with satisfaction.After checking carefully, he shook his head again.The spear was fine. A spear was always used in the formal battle. It moved drastically. Yet normally, the superior cultivators barely used spears.Among all the weapons that could create a spiritual connection, the most common were swords and knives; other kinds of weapons were extremely rare.The spear in front of them lacked spiritualization, but it was still a piece of divine weapon, a perfect weapon for a soldier to cleave enemies and capture the flags.However, although the sword and the knife were a lot better in both quality and value than the so called \u2018the sword of king\u2019, the spiritual part which Ye Xiao valued the most was still missing.Or might be broken.\u201cIt seems the divine weapons you Divine Arms Mill make\u2026 are only worth mentioning in the Land of Han-Yang\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao didn\u2019t continue to make excessive demands.Because with the condition of the Land of Han-Yang, the sword, knife and spear were already in the peak range among the divine weapons!It wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to judge by the standard of the Qing-Yun Realm.\u201cAre these all? Anything else?\u201d Ye Xiao asked with disappointment, \u201cIt would be fine even if it is just some tiny ones. Throwing knives? Sleeve dagger? Throwing needles? Or maybe\u2026\u201dThe shopkeeper had realized that the guy in front of him was was quite professional in smithing although he was young. Yet he actually saw no value in the weapons of his shop\u2026Even the most precious item of the shop\u2026 was too cheap to get in his sight.The shopkeeper felt disgraced.So he spoke, \u201cItems of my humble shop are beneath the professional sight. If the weapons here could not suit your demand, I shall only apologize that there are no better weapons here really\u2026 The smaller ones. We do have some\u2026 There are a set of throwing needles and twelve throwing knives kept in the storage\u2026 But those are the last pieces of our departed great master, Shen Lian-Zi, which remain unfinished\u2026 There is still a final step to finish. And that\u2019s why these unfinished pieces are still kept in our shop. Nobody ever wanted them, so they are more like souvenirs now\u2026\u201dYe Xiao asked indifferently, \u201cThe last pieces of a departed smith? That is interesting. Maybe you could show me.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d The shopkeeper didn\u2019t hesitate and brought up a small leather bag. After it was opened, Ye Xiao\u2019s eyes lit up immediately.Inside the bag, there were 108 shining needles. Every piece of it was extremely thin. They were delicate in shape, giving off a sense of extreme coldness that could make people tremble. Yet the needles were somehow defective; they didn\u2019t have edges. Needles without edges, how would they injure enemies and defend the user. With such a defect, the needles were useless.\u201cTwelve needles together are no thicker than my forefinger. Impressive.\u201d Ye Xiao measured them with eyes and picked one of them in hand. He felt a sense of refreshing coolness and a killing intent hidden inside it. He was motivated: [The needle is filled with spirit. It\u2019s something extraordinary.]He murmured, \u201cYet the needle has no point\u2026 Why?\u201d\u201cThese 108 needles and 12 knives are all made from a piece of Deep Sea Frigid Metal by the great Shen Lian-Zi. They contain no other materials. However, the proper material required to make the edges was yet to be found. They are simply hard to merge. So they have been kept this way.\u201d The shopkeeper was a bit embarrassed.\u201cI see.\u201d Ye Xiao put down the needle.He picked up a throwing knife. The knife was rather delicate. Each of them was only as long as a finger with a beautiful curve. The edge was sharp, filled with terror, shining with a sinister glow.The knives were also defective in the same way \u2013 they had no edges!Deep Sea Frigid Metal!Ye Xiao thought of the Spiritual Essence of Gold in his Spaces that he bought earlier. He had spent 1 million silver bars for it. He was quiet for a moment and then spoke, \u201cThese are fine. I will take them. Give me the price.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 You will take them?\u201d The shopkeeper was surprised.There had been many people saying they were good items after they had saw them, but because they had no edges, they were only ornaments in their eyes. They couldn\u2019t be properly used, so nobody really wanted them. People always left some kind words like \u2018this is truly a masterpiece set made by a great smith\u2026 And then they turned away\u2026For so many years, the shopkeeper had seen a lot of people doing so, but he never expected that the young man in front of him would actually want to buy them.\u201cI do! State a price!\u201d Ye Xiao nodded affirmatively.\u201cWell\u2026\u201d The shopkeeper smiled bitterly, \u201cForgive me, sir. They are not something that can be exchanged with money. Before Shen Lian-Zi passed away, he said that these were Divine Weapons with Demonic Edge; one who was not a monarch should not use them. They are weapons of the monarch. Once they meet the right person, they will be revealed and start killing in the world. He said that once the right person appeared, we shall charge him nothing for them; otherwise, they shouldn\u2019t be sold for even ten thousand golds. We only hope that\u2026 The right one will return us a favor in the future whenever the Divine Arms Mill makes a mistake because of offending someone or if we fall into trouble.\u201dWhen speaking, the shopkeeper was somehow indifferent.[Such defective items are actually called\u2026 the weapon of the monarch?How ridiculous!It was apparently an excuse for the fact that they were impossible to sell because of the flaw.Fine. Since it was the words of a deceased person and luckily the man in front of me has a crazily high standard that disdains everything, I will just present him.They are not gonna be sold out within a thousand years anyway.Making friends with a valuable man shouldn\u2019t be a mistake!]However, after hearing what the shopkeeper had said, Ye Xiao was rather motivated.He stared at the needles and knives for a long time.[Divine Weapon with Demonic Edge!Weapon of the monarch!What does that mean?]It reminded him of his title in the previous life: the Xiao Monarch![The monarch!Does it mean I, the monarch? Or a monarch of the mortal world?]He took a closer look at those dedicated items that were sending out endless senses of hostility. He had a feeling: [These are not some defective items!Nor some unfinished pieces that were casually made!That departed smith, Shen Lian-Zi\u2026 He must have spent all his energy on these 120 pieces of weapons!And that had led him to the death when he finally finished the these fantastic pieces!These are the true most precious items of the Divine Arms Mill!The true divine weapons!Yet he had left such a strange message. Present?Did this Shen Lian-Zi see through the destiny? And wanted to use these items to seek an opportunity to leave the Divine Arms Mill a chance of survival?]He collected thoughts for a long time and then said blandly, \u201cSince master Shen Lian-Zi had left such words, and I like this set of weapons a lot, then\u2026 if someday the Divine Arms Mill offends me\u2026 I will spare you for good!\u201dThe shopkeeper smiled bitterly.[The guy talks with such smugness\u2026 He actually climbs up along the pillar I made[1]\u2026 Spare us? Who do you think you are? Such a\u2026I am speechless!]However, it was the last word of a deceased master, and it was restated by himself, so there was no way to deny it even if he wanted to. So at the moment, his face looked like he just had swallowed shit.Ye Xiao smiled and put the needles and knives into his clothes.108 needles and 12 knives, all together, were packaged only with a small bag.\u201cThat spear. I will take it too.\u201d Ye Xiao pointed at the spear.The spear was for another intent. He once heard Su Ye-Yue said that her father, the Prince Hua-Yang, was the best at using the spear. There amount of weapons in his house could nearly fill up an entire weapon shop and most of them were spears.As he heard previously, he knew that the Prince Hua-Yang must have no proper weapon!Because\u2026 one weapon was enough if it was a proper one. A man doesn\u2019t need to keep that many weapons.This time the battle was in the south. The Prince Hua-Yang would soon join the battle. Therefore, when Ye Xiao saw the spear, he had a plan. He prepared to give it to the Prince Hua-Yang as a gift for nothing but all these years\u2019 secret protection\u2026To give him a spear was something worth doing.\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014[1] To climb the pillar that is made by others, (\u987a\u7740\u7aff\u5b50\u5f80\u4e0a\u722c\uff09\uff0cmeans to seize the very chance for self-praise.2nd guaranteed chapter of the weekTranslated by: RainEdited by: Arch, AlphaPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What do you think?\u201dThe shopkeeper was obviously raising the price.Ye Xiao knew it as well. The spear might not be ordinary, but for the weapons in the market, the prices of the best ones were no higher than 50 thousand.Although that spear was far better than those weapons, the price should not be above 500 thousand!The difference of ten times had reached the limit!It should be stated that spending 500 thousand for just a spear\u2026 would be simply squandering money. A weapon with its spirit broken wasn\u2019t worthy of that.In Ye Xiao\u2019s estimation, the spear was only worth about 250 thousand. That was already an exaggerated price.The shopkeeper knew that Ye Xiao had sharp eyes, yet he still stated a price like that. He had felt uncomfortable because Ye Xiao would have the needles and knives for free, so he intended to earn some money from the spear!He looked at Ye Xiao with a smile. Apparently, he was waiting for Ye Xiao to bargain.[The price must have scared the guy. He will either be angry or talk a lot to bargain. If he really wants it, it will surely take me a long time to finish the deal. However, he spent nothing and took two weapons from me\u2026Even though the needles and knives are defective and nobody ever wants them, they are still the last pieces of the great master. He wouldn\u2019t dare to bargain drastically for the spear, would he?No matter what price you make, I will at least gain some profits. That will fix my loss.]\u201cA fair price.\u201d Contrary to the shopkeeper\u2019s expectation, Ye Xiao agreed without hesitation, \u201c750 thousand, right? That\u2019s it then. I will take it!\u201dThe shopkeeper was shocked and skeptical, because he couldn\u2019t truly believe what he had just heard.He never thought that there was a fool like this guy in the world. Not even in his dreams.A spear, which was slightly better than average quality, was priced for 750 thousand silver bars! The guy didn\u2019t even bargain, he just agreed without any hesitation!However, he didn\u2019t know that from the moment he spoke out the price of 750 thousand, he had already lost the opportunity for the Divine Arms Mill to truly rise in the Land of Han-Yang!Ye Xiao always discriminated between love and hate. He paid debts with gratitude to friends, and with savagery to his enemies.The reason why he hesitated when they were talking about the needles and knives was because he was thinking about whether or not to accept them. And, he finally chose to accept the needles and knives. That meant that he owed a favor to Shen Lian-Zi and also agreed to his request.He had decided to keep an eye on the Divine Arms Mill. If they behaved themselves, he wouldn\u2019t mind helping them truly rise or taking them under his protection once he became strong enough.However, he wouldn\u2019t mind it if he was to return the favor with money. That would reduce a lot of extra efforts on his side.A favor was the debt that was the most difficult to pay!If it was possible to return a favor with money, it was the best bargain!For Ye Xiao, money was the cheapest thing after all.To end the connection with 750 thousand silver bars, that was really the best bargain!He discriminated between love and hate indeed, yet he was not a stubborn man.Even so, if the Divine Arms Mill had troubles in the future, Ye Xiao would offer his help.However, it would only be similar to that of the departed master\u2019s last words\u2026 only a \u2018favor\u2019!Then he could comfort his heart by having the debt paid.He took out some notes and counted 750 thousand silver bars worth of money. He gave the notes to the shopkeeper with pleasure and relief, and then reached his hand to pick up the spear. He said, \u201cI hope we can see each other again.\u201d Then he turned and left.The shopkeeper held the stack of notes and watched Ye Xiao\u2019s back. He didn\u2019t feel happy about earning a lot. Instead, he felt like he had done something terribly wrong\u2026However, that feeling just flashed away. After that, what he could feel was only the great pleasure of gaining so much money![Yah hah hah. Wealth!I gained over 650 thousand by selling only a single spear\u2026 With that material and quality, counting in all the extra cost, the spear costed me no more than 100 thousand\u2026]Ye Xiao walked out the shop with the spear in hand. He casually swung the spear and split it into three parts. One part was the spearhead while the others were only metal sticks.There were two sets of circular joints to reconnect the three parts. The spear could easily be rejoined with a sound of \u2018ka\u2019. It was tightly joined and was able to bear all kind of strikes. As long as the strikes were below the strike-resistance threshold of the spear, the joints could handle them well\u2026There were some light patterns on the spear emitting a sense of coolness. Ye Xiao knew that there must be some Wind Copper mixed into the spear during the tempering. It allowed the spear to absorb the sweat in the hands during the fight.This design prevented the spear from slipping in the user\u2019s hands and causing mistakes. Besides, it made the spear extremely comfortable to hold. That was really an original and convenient idea.Two small words were engraved on the sphere.\u2018Hundred Fights!\u2019It weighed 78 kilograms!Looking back to the entrance of the Divine Arms Mill, Ye Xiao showed a indescribable smile on the corner of his mouth. He then left with big strides, holding the Hundred Fights Spear.\u2026Ye Xiao didn\u2019t go home immediately. He called a carriage and went to the Palace of Hua-Yang with the spear.He packed the three parts of the spear with a big cloth bag and with the bag in hand, he spoke his name in front of the Palace of Hua-Yang.Besides delivering the spear, he naturally had another purpose here.\u2026Prince Hua-Yang was having a meeting with his men discussing the war affair in order to make a military strategy.Although the royal decree hadn\u2019t been made yet, Prince Hua-Yang knew that his presence in that battle was unavoidable this time.At the moment, it was already the last part of the meeting. Prince Hua-Yang said, \u201c\u2026 HA HA. All these years, our passion for fights has never fallen. Since so, when the decree arrives, you and I, my friends, let\u2019s fight side by side in the battlefield once again!\u201dEverybody stood up with respect, \u201cWe will follow the great Prince Hua-Yang to sweep the battlefield!\u201dPrince Hua-Yang laughed loudly with a great heroic spirit.At the moment, someone reported, \u201cThe son of the General Ye Nan-Tian, Ye Xiao, asks for admittance.\u201d\u201cThe son-in-law comes to see his father-in-law. We shall not disturb you of enjoying your harmonious family relationships.\u201d The guys scattered while laughing and joking.In the battle or the war camp, Prince Hua-Yang had strict enforcement of orders and prohibitions. But personally, he never went about with his head high in the air to his men. They were like brothers to him and they always talked freely. Usually, they were not scared of him. When there was a chance to make a joke on him, they would certainly do it.Prince Hua-Yang laughed, \u201cYou bastards never let go of the chance\u2026 All right. Off you all. Let me be clear. When the day comes, if any of you is left behind\u2026 You know what will happen!\u201dThe guys all laughed and left right away.Prince Hua-Yang then changed his expression and said, \u201cWhat reason does the guy come here for? Take him to the reception room.\u201dAnd then he walked to the reception room himself with vigorous strides.In fact, Prince Hua-Yang was not so happy about his daughter\u2019s marriage.He only had one child, yet she was going to marry such a worthless jerk\u2026If he gave no concern about the fact that Ye Nan-Tian had saved his life\u2026 If he hadn\u2019t suggest this engagement with a whim that day, he wouldn\u2019t have been driven mad by the little foppish fool of the house of Ye in the recent years\u2026Prince Hua-Yang was known as the No.1 general in the Kingdom of Chen, the War God of the Kingdom. No one was able to challenge his position.That was acknowledged by all the people in the kingdom!However, only Prince Hua-Yang knew in his own heart. To command an army in a battle, to devise military strategies, to fight in the boundless battlefield\u2026 In any aspect, he was inferior to Ye Nan-Tian\u2026But Ye Nantian had always remained obscure. It was even a bit scary how he had maintained such a low profile. He never initiatively revealed anything about himself\u2026\u201cA great man like Ye Nan-Tian, how can he have a son like Ye Xiao. That is really \u2018a hero father has a stupid son\u2019\u2026 Damn it!\u201d Prince Hua-Yang held his forehead because of headache and murmured.He had decided the marriage because he had thought that \u2018a tiger father would not beget a dog\u2019 [2]. Yet he had never thought that the man who was both brave and resourceful would actually have such a worthless son\u2026Now it was too late for regret.\u2026\u201cWhat are you here for?\u201d Prince Hua-Yang was indifferent. His squared face showed no emotions.Prince Hua-Yang looked down upon Ye Xiao from the bottom of his heart, but a general should stay calm and collected all the time. He should never show his anger from the heart and he should be indifferent to everything.This was Ye Xiao\u2019s first time to see Prince Hua-Yang, his future father-in-law.Princess Hua-Yang, wife of Prince Hua-Yang was also sitting in the room, looking up and down at her future son-in-law.She saw that Ye Xiao behave well. He didn\u2019t looked like the foppish lad as the rumor described. And she found that he had a pretty face, acted elegantly like a young spark. She already had a favorable impression of him.\u201cNothing important actually.\u201d Ye Xiao smiled and said, \u201cI heard that the battle is in the south and the capital is in disturbance because of that\u2026 I am afraid that the good days are about to end.\u201dPrince Hua-Yang looked at his future son-in-law and spoke blandly, \u201cThere is war in the south. The court and the public are in turbulence\u2026 I am afraid this has nothing to do with you.\u201dHis words were rather straight, even dismissive. He was obviously satirizing that Ye Xiao was a stupid black sheep who knew nothing about hardships of the people and was only seeking fun and fooling around in his own life.\u201cHow does it have nothing to do with me? It definitely has something to do with me. A great serious thing.\u201d Ye Xiao spoke seriously, \u201cAs long as you leave for battle, my good days in the capital will end\u2026\u201dPrince Hua-Yang couldn\u2019t help but scornfully laugh, \u201cIt turns out you know about this point. You are slightly better than those who are worse than dog shits.\u201d\u201cI also know that if anything unlucky happens to you, my days will be far worse.\u201d Ye Xiao continued speaking \u2018seriously\u2019.\u2026\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu[1] \u2018fertile soil \u2026 of aliens\u2019 (\u80a5\u6c34\u4e0d\u6d41\u5916\u4eba\u7530) means one should not leave the benefits to the strangers.[2] \u2018a tiger father would not beget a dog son\u2019 (\u864e\u7236\u65e0\u72ac\u5b50) means there will be no laggard among the children of a brave or talented men.3rd guaranteed chapter of the weekTranslator: RainEditors: Alpha, ArchPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 75 \u2013 An Outstanding Character\u201cWhat a prick!\u201d Prince Hua-Yang\u2019s eyes were wide open, he was furious, \u201cYou little\u2026 little shit! What did you say!\u201dPrincess Hua-Yang also humphed in her mind and thought, [This little bastard truly doesn\u2019t know how to talk. Such a waste of his natural-born pretty appearance.] The favorable impression which was just established had instantly crumbled.Ye Xiao laughed and said carelessly, \u201cSo, today I was hanging around\u2026 and saw something. It is pretty good. See. I brought it to you immediately.\u201dSaying that, he dropped the bag on the floor.\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Prince Hua-Yang frowned.\u201cA spear.\u201d Ye Xiao opened the bag and picked up the parts of the spear. With two sounds of \u2018Kah\u2019, the extremely distinguished Hundred Fight Spear showed up in front of them!The spear was in a spiral shape and was made from fine steel. The spearhead was 50 centimeters long!With just a single glance, it aroused a feeling of dread in people\u2019s hearts.\u201cHundred Fight Spear!\u201d Prince Hua-Yang\u2019s eyes lit up as he jumped out of his seat.One the side, Princess Hua-Yang made an exclamation when she saw it.The mother-in-law of Ye Xiao was no ordinary woman. She used to cultivate martial arts and her cultivation level was not low at all. When she saw the world-killing vigor and the overbearing sharpness and proudness of the spear, she knew that it was not some ordinary weapon!The past few days, she was just worrying that her husband should get some powerful weapons for the upcoming battle. Then this guy just brought them this precious spear as if he knew her thoughts like a worm in her body!A sense of satisfaction appeared in her eyes when she looked at Ye Xiao.Ye Xiao didn\u2019t know that his actions had won a good impression from his mother-in-law\u2026Prince Hua-Yang kept his eyes on the spear and paced around it. Apparently, he liked it very much.He had gone to see this spear many times before.However, it needed at least 250 thousand silver bars to buy the spear from the Divine Arms Mill.That was worth as much as the cost of maintaining an army of 500 hundred men for three months. Prince Hua-Yang was extremely fond of the spear and had dreamed about getting it many times. [If only I could hold this spear and stand in the battlefield\u2026]However, he was too thrifty to buy it.But surprisingly, the spear was now in front of him!\u201cHow did you get this treasure?\u201d Su Ding-Guo, i.e. Prince Hua-Yang, didn\u2019t even try to disguise his love for the spear in his eyes.\u201cI bought it, of course.\u201d Ye Xiao smiled, \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t need it\u2026 But I will just leave it to you. It is better staying in your hands than mildewing somewhere else.\u201dPrince Hua-Yang rubbed the mustache and laughed. But suddenly, doubts arose in his mind and he stopped. He asked doubtfully, \u201cHow did you get that much money? That day when I tried to get this spear, I stopped because it was too expensive. You family is not richer than mine. Ye Nan-Tian is poor. How did you buy it? You didn\u2019t swindle it, did you? According to your reputation, you very likely have done so. I heard that you swindled the blood ginseng out of the house of Wang. You must have done the same trick this time\u2026\u201dYe Xiao didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry.[It is true that good news never go beyond the gate, while bad news spread far and wide. Is my reputation really that bad?]\u201cRelax. I got this spear legitimately. And I spent more than others would!\u201d He solemnly said, \u201cAs for why I could afford it, I recently acquired an unexpected wealth\u2026 Please just relax and take it.\u201dPrince Hua-Yang humphed and spoke, \u201cWith your reputation, I can\u2019t trust you\u2026\u201dPrincess Hua-Yang annoyingly said, \u201cWhy are you so stubborn\u2026 The kid cares about you and brought you this precious spear with kindness. You are actually showing an attitude like that. You really shouldn\u2019t.\u201dWhile speaking, she turned to Ye Xiao and said, \u201cXiao Xiao, where did you rob this spear? Ahem. I mean swindle\u2026 Erh. I mean\u2026 Where did you buy it?\u201dYe Xiao was speechless and upset. What a damn grievance![I brought a gift\u2026 Yet I am actually disdained like this! That\u2026 That is truly my first time in my two lives\u2026I, the honorable Xiao Monarch, would actually have such a day!And I can\u2019t burst my anger to them. Instead, I have to cater to them\u2026That is so annoying!]\u201cA few days ago, I saved a man.\u201d Ye Xiao blurted out a lie, \u201cThe man was being chased and ran into me\u2026 A man with a kind heart like me would of course help him. The man gave me two jade bottles before he left.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t care much about them at the beginning. Until lately, I discovered that in each bottle, there was a supreme dan bead\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao said.\u201cHuh?\u201dPrincess Hua-Yang exclaimed. She looked surprised and happy.\u201cWhat? Really?\u201d Prince Hua-Yang was a collected man, but he couldn\u2019t help exclaiming. He stood up, \u201cWere they really the supreme dan beads?\u201dAs the No.1 general in the Kingdom of Chen, how could he not know of the supreme dan beads that had stirred up the chaos in the whole capital these past few days? He would never have expected that this guy had actually saved the owner of the supreme dan beads.[It is true that Feng Zhi-Ling has been missing since he left the salesroom\u2026 He was being hunted, and was saved by the lucky Ye Xiao\u2026Does this kid have a kind heart? It must be a coincidence that he saved the owner of the supreme dan beads and benefitted as a return!]\u201cThen where are the supreme dan beads?\u201d Prince Hua-Yang asked.Ye Xiao took out a jade bottle and smiled, \u201cRight here. I knew that you are going to join the battle soon, so I brought you the supreme dan bead as a gift\u2026\u201dPrincess didn\u2019t wait for Prince Hua-Yang to speak and quickly snatched the bottle.She acted so quickly that Prince Hua-Yang didn\u2019t have the time to react.That was no kidding. With such a dan, her husband was like carrying an extra life with him!That was so precious!\u201cXiao, you are so\u2026\u201d Princess Hua-Yang nearly choked with sobs, \u201cSo full of filial piety! It was a truly worthwhile thing to let our daughter marry you\u2026 Oh\u2026\u201dWomen were capricious. Princess Hua-Yang just had a few good feelings to Ye Xiao, but now she liked him to the fullest. She had already started to call him \u2018Xiao\u2019 now. Apparently, she had already treated him as her present son-in-law. A gift from her son-in-law was obviously something she should and would love to accept!Prince Hua-Yang was speechless.[Arh. Woman\u2026 Several days ago you just cried in front of me blaming me that letting our daughter marry that guy was ruining our daughter\u2019s life. Look at you now. Just for a dan bead, you immediately \u2019sold\u2019 our daughter to him\u2026]\u201cWhat a loss of principle! You just can\u2019t restrain yourself.\u201dPrince Hua-Yang sighed helplessly and said, \u201cAnd the other dan bead?\u201dHe was thinking, [The battle is full of traps. If any of my loyal brothers suffers a fatal wound, another supreme dan bead can save another life. Although it is a bit presumptuous to ask for it, I could only care less about that right now!I have already betrothed my daughter to you. What could be wrong to only asked for two dan beads!]Thinking about that, he spoke boldly, \u201cHow many do you have? Take them out! Give me all!\u201d[I should be allowed to ask for anything from my son-in-law!]Princess Hua-Yang showed the whites of her eyes. [You old man criticized me just now\u2026 It turns out you have lost your principle yourself! I was just accepting it from others, yet you are asking for it. That\u2019s a huge difference. I despise you very much!]\u201cI don\u2019t have it\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao threw up his hands, \u201cI sold the other one and bought the spear for you. Where do you think did I get the money from\u2026\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Prince Hua-Yang was furious, \u201cYou black sheep! You you you\u2026 You are exasperating\u2026 A dan bead that could bring the dead back to life, you exchanged it for a stupid bloody spear!\u201dPrincess Hua-Yang was unhappy all the sudden, \u201cWhat are you talking about, you old man? The kid just saved one for you. He could have kept it to himself and you wouldn\u2019t know of it, would you? You old man. You really don\u2019t know how to appreciate what is good for you! How could you say it\u2019s just a stupid spear. You have longed for it for a long time. I always knew that!\u201dPrince Hua-Yang was a bit guilty and said, \u201cWhat a shame\u2026 A supreme dan bead could save a life\u2026\u201d He still felt aching about it.He usually didn\u2019t appreciate a supreme dan bead a lot, but since the war was approaching, he saw it as something extremely valuable.Ye Xiao did have more, a lot more. However, he wouldn\u2019t dare to reveal them at the moment even if he would die for not doing so\u2026As a man like Prince Hua-Yang, it was normal that he had one supreme dan bead. But if he had many\u2026 it would draw suspicions or greedy eyes. He was afraid that everyone in the Palace of Hua-Yang would be in danger because of it\u2026If so, that was not a gift, but a curse!Xiao Xiao said, \u201cYou are not seeing things in the right way\u2026 With this spear, you will be invincible in the battle, killing enemies, capturing flags\u2026 That will save a lot more lives than what a dan bead could do.\u201dPrincess Hua-Yang\u2019s eyes lit up and she said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. That is reasonable. As long as you stay alive, you can save many many men!\u201dShe was a clever woman, so she naturally understood the meaning of Ye Xiao\u2019s words: [The supreme dan bead\u2026 You must not give it to others\u2026That means giving a life.]Prince Hua-Yang sighed and frowned for a long time.After a while, he spoke gently, \u201cThey are all my brothers\u2026 It is acceptable not to save them when I am not able to\u2026 However, I could, if I were to keep this dan bead for myself\u2026 how could I face myself again?\u201dThe princess and Ye Xiao were both silent.Loving his soldiers like they were his own sons and sharing happiness and woe with them; standing side by side in the chaotic storms of the world.That was Prince Hua-Yang, Su Ding-Guo.He meticulously treated his soldiers as he treated his own kin. The princess and Ye Xiao both believed that in the battle, if one of his men and himself were both badly injured\u2026 the one who would take the supreme dan bead would never be Prince Hua-Yang!Even if he had 100 supreme dan beads with him, he would take none for himself.If he wasn\u2019t like that, maybe he wouldn\u2019t have been the Prince Hua-Yang whose majesty was felt throughout the whole kingdom for decades.Ye Xiao felt admiration in his heart.An outstanding character, Prince Hua-Yang was definitely one!\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euPrince Hua-Yang was delighted. He asked Ye Xiao to stay for dinner and let Su Ye-Yue, who was grounded, to join them. The four of them sat together around the table, two old and young couples. It really looked like a harmonious family enjoying happiness together. The house was filled with laughter and cheerful voices.\u20264th guaranteed chapter of the week.Translated by: RainEdited by: Alpha, ArchPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

At least right now, he didn\u2019t loathe him like he did before.What Ye Xiao did had made some difference. He brought the spear to Prince Hua-Yang before he left for battle.That was not something an ordinary kid would do.\u201cOur families have been close for many years, but we have never enjoyed a proper meal together. Your father has been guarding the north all the time. He seldom comes back to the capital. I have been staying in the capital all the time and I could not leave for even a day. And whenever your father returns, it means I have to leave for somewhere else\u2026\u201dSu Ding-Guo smiled gently, \u201cBecause when your father returns, it means the north is in peace. Since the most dangerous area is in peace, it means matters in the other areas need to be handled as the primary tasks for the kingdom\u2026 There won\u2019t be anyone who could complete such tasks well except me.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 It was arrogant to say I am the only one who can do that. In fact, your father surely can, but he is too lazy. He would never waste a single minute of his vacation.\u201d He looked at Ye Xiao.Ye Xiao didn\u2019t speak. He kept acting decently; silently eating and drinking.Su Ye-Yue looked at her father, and then looked at Ye Xiao. She smiled with pleasure from the bottom of her heart. She lowered her head to focus on eating. She seemed to be thinking about something and her cheeks suddenly turned red\u2026Ye Xiao raised the cup and proposed a toast to Prince Hua-Yang. And then he said, \u201cI wonder how you and my father became friends?\u201dSu Ding-Guo\u2019s eyes were clouded with nostalgia as he stared blankly for a second. He then gently answered, \u201cYour father\u2026 is truly a peerless figure\u2026\u201d\u201cPeerless figure?\u201d Ye Xiao was surprised.The word \u2018peerless\u2019 was not a word that people casually used.For Ye Xiao, there were only a few that he thought were peerless in both the Land of Han-Yang and the Qing-Yun Realm.However\u2026[Even though he is only a peerless man in the Land of Han-Yang\u2026] He drank and thought, [\u2026 he is still peerless after all.]\u201cI am a prince in the kingdom. I have seen many great men. I know something about great people. However\u2026 I still have no idea where your father came from even after all these years. It is like he just suddenly appeared out of nowhere\u2026 And he looks down upon the world.\u201dPrince Hua-Yang\u2019s voice was filled with yearning for the past.After he spoke those words, he glanced at Ye Xiao and then turned a bit angry, \u201cYou goddamn fool have never known what your father has done for you. You have no idea how much he has sacrificed for you! You ungrateful stupid bastard! Stupid little shit! You garbage!\u201dYe Xiao was speechless.[What the hell is the matter with him?We were just happy drinking, eating and talking, and praising my father, yet he suddenly started to shout at me\u2026 I just gave you a spear worth 750 thousand\u2026You old fool actually cursed me!Are you drunk or have you taken any wrong pills?]\u201cYou\u2026 Speak discreetly. Why are you cursing?\u201d Princess Hua-Yang was also unsatisfied with what her husband had just said. She frowned and said, \u201cIn front of the kids, keep your decency, would you? You are a prince\u2026\u201d\u201cDecency my ass! Prince my cock! Without his father, I must have died a long time ago! What kind of dead man need decency!\u201dPrince Hua-Yang hit the table and pointed at Ye Xiao, \u201cYou little shit. You seem a little better now, yet when thinking about what a prick you were before, I only want to split you into pieces! And feed your penis to the dogs!\u201dPrince Hua-Yang and Su Ye-Yue both blushed and lowered their heads.[What did the old fool say. He actually wanted to feed the dogs with his own son-in-law\u2019s penis\u2026 What a fool!]Ye Xiao was stunned. He was at a loss.[Why\u2026 Why is he so emotional?The former owner of my body was not a good kid. That is true. But no matter how bad he was, he was just a teenager. How bad could he possibly be? Is it necessary to curse him like that?]As Prince Hua-Yang talked like that, Ye Xiao was like a scourge that was hated by both man and god!Prince Hua-Yang stopped and sighed.\u201cIn those years\u2026\u201d It looked like he was once again experiencing the battles from those days.\u201cThat year, I led the army against the Kingdom of Lan-Feng. In an attempt to rescue the besieged 30 thousand brothers of mine, I raided the enemy\u2019s troops. That time, the Kingdom of Lan-Feng had discovered my raid. They set up a trap and were waiting for me to fall in it. What I did was to actually lead my men to their deaths\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen I thought we were all going to die there, a man in white wearing a mask suddenly appeared. He came from the sky with only a sword. He landed in the middle of the 300 thousand soldiers of the Kingdom of Lan-Feng and led me to slash a path out of it.\u201d\u201cWith the help of this marvelous cultivator, I actually survived. The most important thing was that, if he didn\u2019t show up that time, that would be a big failure of mine. The invincible Military God? It would have been a joke already!\u201d\u201cThat day, the sun bled into the sky. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers were fighting in the final battle of the war.\u201d He raised his head and stared at the sky through the window. He spoke gently, \u201cThe blood had dyed the ground. Every soldier of either side had went mad because of killing. At that time, an impatient and vigorous voice echoed, \u2018Who is Su Ding-Guo?\u2019\u201d\u201cThe voice came from far away, but everyone in the battle heard it. It was a battle of hundreds of thousands people! Even a thunder was insignificant at that moment\u2026 However, that voice had made all the soldiers stopped fighting at the same time!\u201d\u201cI was among my men. I thought that there was a superior cultivator in the enemy\u2019s troops and he wanted to kill me in order to capture my flag. Even though I knew I would never have a chance to defeat such a superior cultivator, I couldn\u2019t lower my head in front of all my men. So I answered loudly, \u2018I am Su Ding-Guo! Speak your name! I never kill a man with no name!\u2019\u201dWhen he spoke of these events, Prince Hua-Yang felt like he was seeing the gruesome scenes of that battle once again. His voice became terrified and his face horribly distorted.Su Ye-Yue was overtaken by worry, so she held her father\u2019s hand.Prince Hua-Yang took a deep breath and calmed down. He laughed and said, \u201cDamn it\u2026 \u2018Never kill a man with no name\u2019 my ass. With a single battle, I had killed more than one thousand men without knowing any of their names. What I said was just to boost my courage. The man was too strong for me. His strength was in a level that I had never known about. A general shouldn\u2019t fear death during the battle, however, dealing with a powerful enemy like that, I felt terrified\u2026\u201dYe Xiao was surprised that his father-in-law was so cute that he actually told them his innermost thoughts and feelings, as well as his disgraceful experience!\u201c\u2026 That voice then spoke, \u2018You are Su Ding-Guo? Good. Let me give you a gift.\u2019 And then I saw a sword light rushing over from the peak of a mountain. At that moment, because of the shining sword light, the sun seemed to lose its glow\u2026 The sword light was getting bigger and bigger, longer and longer, harder and harder\u2026 Finally it reached the\u2026 crowd!\u201dPrince Hua-Yang was fascinated. Recalling the sword light in that battle, he was filled with enjoyment.Princess Hua-Yang must have thought about something naughty as a blush appeared on her face. She looked at Prince Hua-Yang with embarrassment and then lowered her head immediately. She was murmuring, \u201cShameless old bastard!\u201dYe Xiao was holding the cup and touching his lower jaw with a look of \u2018I am listening and thinking\u2019.In his heart, he felt very curious, [Longer and longer? Bigger and bigger? Harder and harder\u2026Was he really talking about the sword light?]He couldn\u2019t help looking down on his crotch\u2026And then he coughed and said, \u201cAdmirable! Admirable!\u201d He raised the cup and drank.Prince Hua-Yang was lost in the memory of the old days. He was shaking his head slowly and murmuring. He didn\u2019t know he had described the sword light in an inappropriate way.Obviously, that battle was the greatest honor of Prince Hua-Yang!\u201cThat sword move slaughtered those men like crushing dry weeds and smashing rotten wood [1]!\u201d Prince Hua-Yang sighed, \u201cPeople always said that the army slaughters its adversaries as easy as crushing dry weeds and smashing rotten wood\u2026 After that, I witnessed what crushing dry weeds and smashing rotten wood truly means! That was the real glow of a peerless expert!\u201d\u201cAfter that light slashed down, thousands of men had already fallen while he calmly stood there. I discovered that the man\u2019s clothes was still clean and white!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2014\u2014[1] Crushing dry weeds and smashing rotten wood (\u6467\u67af\u62c9\u673d) means destroy things easily with irresistible force.This is the 5th Guaranteed Chapter of the week.Translated by: RainEdited by: Arch, SietsePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 77 \u2013 Questions About His ParentsPrince Hua-Yang continued speaking passionately. His face had turned red because he was excited enough to feel his blood boil.\u201c\u2026 Across the blade of his sword, blood flowed, dripping down to the ground. His eyes resembled two sharp swords which stared at me and he asked, \u2018Su Ding-Guo, I can bring a complete turnabout in this battle, but in return, you need to give me a thing. What do you think?\u2019 And then I answered, \u2018As long as you can turn the table, I can even give you my head!\u2019 The man in white nodded and said, \u2018Very well. Follow me!\u2019\u201d\u201cThe whole conversation had no superfluous words. And then he turned around and fought his way towards the densest part of the enemy troops\u2019 formation. We fought hard, rushing here and there, covering the entire battlefield. He used incredible martial arts to change the flow of the battle and then, all my men got together under his lead and broke out of the encirclement!\u201d\u201cFrom beginning to end, the man in black was concentrating on fighting and rushing. When his sword swung, all the people in front of him fell down. He kept swinging his sword till we got out. He never stopped, his sword never stopped.\u201d\u201cThe man in white was your father, Ye Nan-Tian!\u201dSu Ding-Guo looked at Ye Xiao, \u201cDo you know why your father saved me?\u201dYe Xiao was stunned and he said, \u201cWas it\u2026 for me?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! You are not completely stupid after all!\u201d Prince Hua-Yang humphed and said, \u201cAfter we got out of the besiegement, before I had time to say thank you to your father, he said, \u2018Now that I have done what I promised to do, you should honour your end of the deal. I need your Seven Hearts Nine Seeds Dreamy Lotus!\u2019. He was completely exhausted. In fact your father had received many wounds during the fight. More than fifty cuts were gushing out blood, but he didn\u2019t care about them at all. He simply stated his request.\u201dYe Xiao was astonished.[The Seven Hearts Nine Seeds Dreamy Lotus!He wanted that!]At that moment, the Xiao Monarch finally realized what had been wrong with his body.The Seven Hearts Nine Seeds Lotus was used for curing some natural-born diseases.Actually, when the dead Ye Xiao was still a fetus, he had been suffering from poisoning and Jing and Mai damage. Although he was successfully born, his body was weak and he was in a critical condition throughout his infancy.This Lotus was the perfect cure for that.It was not extremely precious, but it was extremely rare!The reason why it was called \u2018Dreamy Lotus\u2019 was that it was only seen in dreams.Prince Hua-Yang laughed and said, \u201cI found it by coincidence when I was in a battle on a snow mountain. I encountered an avalanche and was buried underneath the snow. After I dug myself out, I found the Seven Hearts Nine Seeds Dreamy Lotus. Although I had been cherishing the Dreamy Lotus, after that fight, I had no hesitation and I said, \u2018You can have it!\u2019\u201d\u201cAfter that, we returned to the capital. When we arrived, the first thing I did was to send the lotus to your father.\u201d Su Ding-Guo smiled warmly, \u201cAnd the friendship between your father and I was built at that moment.\u201dYe Xiao felt that a lot of events had started to make sense.He thought, [My \u2018father\u2019 actually did such a great thing in the past\u2026 Killing in and out a battle alone with one sword only to get the cure for his sick son. He deserves to be called \u2018peerless figure\u2019 indeed\u2026]When Ye Xiao imagined the scene of Ye Nan-Tian fighting and rushing inside an encirclement made by hundreds of thousands of men with only a single sword in his hand, although he showed a calm exterior, he felt his blood boil.\u201cWhat your father did for you was really\u2026\u201d Prince Hua-Yang looked at Ye Xiao like he was exasperated about his disappointing lifestyle, \u201cHe had been extremely worried about you! He had almost given up his whole life for you\u2026 Yet you are\u2026 Arh!\u201dHe took a deep breath. Obviously, he had lost all interest in talking any more.Prince Hua-Yang thought of the day when Ye Nan-Tian fought alone on the battle and then looked at Ye Xiao. He felt sad for Ye Nan-Tian.Ye Xiao took a deep breath too. He lowered his head.Even though the one Prince Hua-Yang was criticizing was not him, yet he felt what \u2018Ye Xiao\u2019 should feel.[In my previous life\u2026 if I could have such a father, a father who would sacrifice everything for his son\u2026 How happy would I be?] He thought.When collecting his thoughts, he was suddenly motivated, [Father sacrificed everything, but\u2026 what about mother? Prince Hua-Yang didn\u2019t mention my mother all along!]So he asked, \u201cWell\u2026 What about my mother?\u201dWhen speaking of \u2018mother\u2019, he felt a strange excitement in his heart, even though he had been living as a man for two lives. The feeling was warm but it also contained a bit of loneliness\u2026[My mother\u2026]How warm. He felt a strong yearning for her.He never had met his parents in his previous life\u2026 He had never known who had given birth to him. Until he died, he didn\u2019t know who his parents were.Did he have a mother now?He must have!He should!Prince Hua-Yang wore a sad expression and shook his head slowly. He quietly said, \u201cI have no idea. I never met your mother\u2026 Your father never mentioned her.\u201dYe Xiao was surprised.In fact, he had thought that his mother might be dead for a long time. However, after hearing what Prince Hua-Yang said, he figured there must be some hidden reasons for her disappearance.[Nobody has ever mentioned my mother in front of me. My father never did\u2026 If she died, why didn\u2019t anybody talk to me about her?There is something strange about it!]He didn\u2019t speak anymore, but he bore it in mind.After a short silence, Su Ding-Guo continued speaking\u2026 The lotus hadn\u2019t made any big difference. After that, Ye Nan-Tian went to see the king of the Kingdom of Chen under Su Ding-Guo\u2019s recommendation. The king gave him the best medicine of the kingdom, but as a return, Ye Nan-Tian had to become a sworn brother to the king and guard the northern border for twenty years. The medicine attained was really extraordinary and it successfully restored Ye Xiao\u2019s condition to a normal, healthy condition\u2026Ye Xiao had already heard this story from the steward, yet, after hearing it once more, he still felt excited and thrilled.A father could actually do such a thing for his son\u2026However, after the excitement subsided, Ye Xiao came out with a question. The Dreamy Lotus was divine among medicines. As per his knowledge, it could easily cure every poison and diseases in the Land of Han-Yang.However, after Ye Xiao took it, although it was somewhat effective, it still didn\u2019t work well. He still needed the medicine of the Kingdom of Chen to be fully cured. That meant that he had suffered from an extraordinary condition, and the cause of the damage was something not from this realm!His father, single handedly, was able to kill hundreds of thousands men in the battle\u2026[In another word, my father, and mother, even the steward, are very possibly not residents of the Land of Han-Yang. They must be from a higher realm\u2026But how did they get down?]While collecting his thoughts, he kept finding new information about his family. Finally, he focused on the words of Prince Hua-Yang\u2026After that battle, there was a new prince with a name different from the royal family in the kingdom \u2014 Prince Hua-Yang. Su Ding-Guo had made great contributions, so it was reasonable that he was awarded the royal title. However, people didn\u2019t know that there was another prince in the kingdom\u2026\u201cTo be a sworn brother of the king, he naturally became a prince. But your father stoutly refused the title. The king had no other choices but to announce that the title should be reserved for your clan in the royal family book. No one ever divulged information about this.\u201dHe laughed, \u201cSo, in people\u2019s eyes, there is only one prince with a different surname in the kingdom. Hah hah. In fact, there are two. And we got the title at the same time.\u201dThey all smiled.At the end of the conversation, Su Ding-Guo finished another cup of liquor and tapped Ye Xiao on the shoulder. He spoke softly, \u201cXiao Xiao, you better\u2026 not let your father down\u2026\u201dHe said with a comforting tone, \u201cThese days, I have seen you change a lot indeed. You finally stopped fooling around like you did before\u2026 Heh heh\u2026\u201dAt the end of the dinner, Prince Hua-Yang was seriously drunk and immediately went to sleep.His wife naturally went to take care of him. There were only two of them left at the table, Su Ye-Yue and Ye Xiao.Actually, Ye Xiao wanted to return home right now.He had done what he came to to. He felt that he didn\u2019t need to stay any longer. For him, the most important thing at the moment was to deal with his newly acquired Divine Weapon with Demonic Edge.\u201cI ur\u2026 I better be off.\u201d Ye Xiao giggled and touched his head. Being criticized for a whole night, he felt that he had actually come to ask for torturing this time\u2026\u201cWhat did you say? You are leaving?\u201d At the beginning Su Ye-Yue blushed and kept her head low like a bashful lady, but when she heard Ye Xiao, she started acting overwhelmingly, \u201cWhat does that mean? You were so happy being criticized by my father. Now you are alone with me and you actually want to leave! Humph! Move if your dare!\u201dYe Xiao groaned, \u201cPlease my dear lady\u2026\u201d\u201cA \u2018dear lady\u2019 couldn\u2019t help you!\u201d Her tongue was vicious. She rested her arms on her waist. Apparently, she was reaching for the whip that was given to her by Ye Nan-Tian. Oh, the fabulous husband-disciplining tool.Ye Xiao gave up immediately, \u201cFine. Ok. I never wanted to leave. I just want to find out if you would ask me to stay or not.\u201d\u201cHumph!\u201d She didn\u2019t believe him, apparently.But she was satisfied that Ye Xiao would stay. She jumped breezily with her hands on the back and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go to the back yard. People always say a smart man and a pretty girl staying under the moon beside the flowers show each other their \u2026 sort of love stuff\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201dYe Xiao held his forehead and groaned. He sighed deep within his heart.[The girl must be seriously poisoned by those romantic stories in the books and seeking those plots in reality. That is not good\u2026][A smart man and a pretty girl showing each other their \u2018sort of love\u2019\u2026 Gosh\u2026 When they have money, they are a smart man and a pretty girl. Without it, there will never be the \u2018sort of love\u2019\u2026] Ye Xiao smiled bitterly and thought, [There was only \u2018adultery\u2019\u2026]Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2026This is the first sponsored chapter.Special thanks to Nicholas W. and Nathan M. for sponsoring this chapter.Translator : RainEditor : Alpha, ArchPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Ye Xiao. Ye Xiao. Hahahaha\u2026\u201d Su Ye-Yue opened her mouth, showing her clean white teeth. She laughed, \u201cNo matter how I resist, it sounds like \u2018midnight snack [1]\u2019 to me. Try saying it several times and you will agree with me.\u201d\u201cMidnight snack?\u201d Ye Xiao felt embarrassed.He himself had chosen this name in his previous life. It meant that even a fallen leaf [2] with no roots could laugh at the entire firmament. \u2018Ye\u2019 meant that he was an orphan who had no family. And also he had been carrying a jade pendant with the word \u2018Ye\u2019 on it since he was a child. As for the \u2018Xiao\u2019, it was rather easy to understand.People lived, people laughed [3]. People should live with joy.[How did it become a midnight snack?]In Ye Xiao\u2019s whole previous life, no one had ever dared to call the Xiao Monarch \u2018midnight snack\u2019.He looked at Su Ye-Yue and thought, [She must be a foodie deep in her heart\u2026]Thinking about how he got his name, he touched his chest and felt sad, [Now that my jade pendant was taken\u2026 by the woman in the Qing-Yun Realm. I wonder where she would keep it? And where she is now?How is she doing?]\u201cThat\u2019s right. Midnight snack.\u201d Su Ye-Yue was thrilled. Jumping and walking with her hands on the back, she said complacently, \u201cFinally, I know how you got your name.\u201dYe Xiao was embarrassed, \u201cYou do? Really?\u201d\u201cOf course. It is obvious, isn\u2019t it\u2026\u201d Su Ye-Yue laughed and said, \u201cIt is said that some day in the past when Uncle Ye was drinking with my father, they were both drunk and they talked about the derivation of your name. Uncle Ye laughed loudly and said\u2026 \u2018Well the name actually means midnight snack.\u2019\u201dYe Xiao\u2019s face was twisted and he spoke with his eyes wide opened, \u201cIt really means midnight snack?\u201d\u201cYes. My dad was surprised at that moment, so he asked \u2018why\u2019\u2026\u201d Su Ye-Yue spoke cheerfully, \u201cAnd then Uncle Ye said that\u2026 when he had just married your mother, they were so deep in love with each other. That night\u2026 That night\u2026 Ahem\u2026\u201dShe might not be a sensible girl, but she stopped talking when speaking of that. Her extraordinarily beautiful face was blushing like the butt of a baboon, but it made her look even more gorgeous.\u201cThat night what?\u201d Ye Xiao didn\u2019t want to stop. He wanted to know everything.\u201cAhem\u2026 Anyway\u2026 It was\u2026\u201d Su Ye-Yue kept rolling her eyes and tried to find out the proper words to say. She blushed and spoke haltingly, \u201cIt was said that Uncle Ye wanted to have some midnight snack\u2026 So aunty went to cook some for him. Before she finished cooking, Uncle Ye was too hungry. He couldn\u2019t hold it and\u2026 so he \u2018ate\u2019 aunty instead\u2026 Ahem\u2026 And then after some time, you were born. So Uncle Ye just gave you the name\u2026 Ye Xiao. Just as the name implies, you were born because of the midnight snack. So, ahem, hmm, you are midnight snack\u2026\u201dShe spoke with many pauses and her eyes were dodging Ye Xiao\u2019s eyes.Apparently, it would make the girl embarrassed if she had to explain this any more.But Ye Xiao had a different feeling.He nearly passed out. Deep in his heart, he really wanted to pass out.[What the hell is that? How is this logical? What is the point?]Even though he was always calm and used to be the world-shocking Xiao Monarch, at the moment, he truly felt dizzy. [My name\u2026 actually\u2026 comes\u2026 from that\u2026Wanted to have some midnight snack\u2026 Went to cook\u2026 Couldn\u2019t hold it\u2026 Had another kind of\u2026 \u2018midnight snack\u2019? And got pregnant? And gave birth to a son\u2026 who was named \u2018midnight snack\u2019?Er\u2026 No\u2026 Ye Xiao?That is the whole process?Oh my bloody heaven god\u2026Let me die.]Suddenly, Ye Xiao felt a pain in his heart that nearly drove him to death.[I would have never expected that the explanation of my name would be such\u2026 My god\u2026]\u201cNo. It doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d Ye Xiao returned to his senses and looked at her, \u201cYou are younger than me. How did you know that? Even your father hasn\u2019t met my mother. How could you know such a personal thing about my parents? It doesn\u2019t make any sense\u2026 Is it\u2026 Did you just make it up?\u201dYe Xiao looked at her, expecting her to change her story. [God bless me. Tell me that you are making it up\u2026]\u201cYou are a liar, not me!\u201d Su Ye-Yue pouted, \u201cMy dad was drunk and telling jokes and stuff with your father.Your father himself told my dad about it. It wouldn\u2019t be a lie, would it? Humph. They thought nobody was around but in fact, I was there listening secretly. It is true.\u201dYe Xiao felt hopeless. He wanted to hang himself on a tree several times\u2026With sad eyes, he looked at Su Ye-Yue who was blabbering on and on because of the interesting topic she had just picked up. He felt like the world had become darker\u2026 [It turns out my name is midnight snack\u2026Damn it.I must be the only one who had such a weird origin for his name\u2026]\u201cHey. Why are you so down? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d After walking for quite a distance, Su Ye-Yue finally felt less embarrassed about the topic, yet she found Ye Xiao hadn\u2019t caught up with her, so she turned around and asked.\u201cI am thinking\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao sighed with sadness and said, \u201cWhen I have a wife, would she ask for midnight snacks all the time\u2026\u201d\u201cPah\u2026\u201d Su Ye-Yue blushed and reached out her hand to pinch him, \u201cDo you really think you are that tasty\u2026 Come on. Let me teach you how to stop being a shameless guy. I will show you my Sword Art Of Feng-Hua\u2026\u201dShe had concentrated on cultivating these days and had shown shocking improvement. With the Sword Art Of Feng-Hua and the Spiritual Method Of Feng-Hua, her rate of improvement had become much faster than anyone else in the history of the Qing-Yun Realm.So her confidence had shot up to the peak.Ye Xiao fought clumsily. In contrast, Su Ye-Yue swung her sword like a stream of waterfall in a painting. She fought with natural and smooth moves, she was able to move however she wished. After beating Ye Xiao up for a while, she finally felt satisfied. She waved her hand and spoke like the king sparing a convict, \u201cOff you go.\u201dYe Xiao hurried off.It was too hard for him to continue acting\u2026The girl\u2019s improvement had been above his expectation, but\u2026No matter how good the Sword Art Of Feng-Hua was, it was modified by Ye Xiao himself. Considering Su Ye-Yue\u2019s current capability, it would be as easy as flicking a finger for him to win the fight.But Ye Xiao knew well what result would that bring to him. He would have been at least kept in there to practice with her for a ages\u2026So he chose to be beaten and then leave the place for good.Su Ye-Yue humphed and looked at the retreating back of Ye Xiao. She murmured with a complex emotion in her eyes, \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to stay, so he let me win\u2026 Humph. He must have something important to do. I won\u2019t disturb him then.\u201d She was unhappy. After a while, she was completely lost in thoughts, [He really is different now. In the past, when he was beaten up by me, he would only beg for me to stop with a full mouth of sweet words. Now he is so calm and he left like a light breeze\u2026 Was I not beating him heavily enough?\u201d]She was holding her sword and thinking. She waved her fist and murmured, \u201cI am not strong enough. I have to continue cultivating. Next time I will beat him harder.\u201dOn the other hand, Ye Xiao hurried home without stopping.The first thing he saw after arriving was the steward who wore a strange look.It was as if he was looking at a monster or his forefather.It was a look filled with helplessness and disappointment.\u201cUncle Song, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Ye Xiao was confused.[I just got home and you are looking at me like that? Do you know that I am not so comfortable with that?]\u201cMy dearest forefather.\u201d Song Jue sighed heavily, \u201cYou promised that you wouldn\u2019t get into any trouble, did you not?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t get in any trouble. I did not\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao scratched his head innocently and showed confusion.\u201cYou dare say you didn\u2019t! Then explain, what do you expect trouble to be\u2026\u201d The steward sighed, sadness being shown in his eyes.[My big brother, how come you only have one child?People pay money for troubles they make.Your son pays with lives for the troubles he makes. I wonder how many lives it would take.All those troublemakers I have seen in my life together cannot compare to your son.]\u201cA mail has come to us from the Crown Prince\u2019s Palace. The crown prince wants to meet with you.\u201d The steward sighed, \u201cAnd\u2026 I heard that you went to the west market, and three men died\u2026\u201dThe steward showed the whites of his eyes, \u201cAfter some sort of clarification, it was revealed that those men were from the Crown Prince\u2019s Palace, my dear young lord. If you have nothing to do with that\u2026 it must be some ghost who had shown up under the sun.\u201dYe Xiao threw his hands up and said, \u201cUncle Song. To catch a thief, you need proof; to accuse someone of adultery, you catch them both. [4] To accuse me of murder, I don\u2019t mind if there is no proof, but it should at least be reasonable, right? Why would I be involved? How strange, people from the Mu Clan died and I am under suspicion; people from the Crown Prince\u2019s Palace died and I am under suspicion; am I to be under suspicion when anyone dies? Who on earth is messing with me now? So unbelievable. Is there any justice in the world?\u201dThe steward showed the whites of his eyes and was speechless. He suppressed the eagerness in his heart to push Ye Xiao down and spank him on the ass.[Wherever you are, people die there.And people are all your enemies. Who would believe it even if you say you have nothing to do with them?What proof do you want? What reason? Everyone can see through it.]When thinking of that, the steward suddenly had doubts filling his mind. He raised his head and stared at his young master \u2014 his nephew.[It doesn\u2019t make sense\u2026Why\u2026 Why are all of them from our enemies?And none of our men even got hurt?Of course it is good that our men stay fine.

    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 79 \u2013 A Boat Capsizes In A Calm Sea[The death of Mu Cheng-Bai is an unsettled case.Who could have killed him?After that, the three assassins, who were the guards of the Crown Prince\u2019s Palace, died in the west street market. Yet Ye Xiao is perfectly fine after returning from the market, unharmed and rather happy.Then\u2026 who killed them?Since they were assassins, they must have been assigned to do the same task. According to the information received from the market, all three of them must have been killed in an instant.Who were they aiming at? Who was their target?That is pretty obvious actually\u2026 it would be Ye Xiao.Then, who killed them?Mu Cheng-Bai had an average cultivation level, so he was easy to kill. But this time, it was three guards from the Crown Prince\u2019s Palace. They were not some ordinary cultivators, but even they got killed instantly. They were killed at the same moment together. No matter who did that, he must have accomplished an extremely difficult mission.So\u2026]The steward looked at Ye Xiao. The confusion in his eyes now turned into questioning.[Ye Xiao. Does he have such capability?]\u201cXiao Xiao\u2026\u201d Song Jue used Ye Xiao\u2019s nickname. That meant he was talking to him as his uncle, \u201cHave you been\u2026 going through anything special?\u201d\u201cSpecial? What special?\u201d Ye Xiao was stunned, \u201cNo. I have not.\u201d\u201cBut your have improved a lot in cultivation.\u201d Song Jue frowned and looked at Ye Xiao, \u201cYou can\u2019t deny that, can you?\u201dYe Xiao rubbed his nose and nodded.He couldn\u2019t lie about that. It was obvious, especially for a sharp person like Song Jue.If he made an ambiguous statement or a lie right now, he would only embarrass himself.\u201cYou have improved; I am happy to see so. Come on, show me what you\u2019ve got.\u201d Song Jue waved his hand and dragged Ye Xiao to the backyard. While walking, he gave the guards an order, \u201cGuards! Seal the backyard. Nobody gets in.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Two of the 36 blood guards answered loudly, and then moved away.Suddenly, the whole house had turned into a highly secure arena. Let alone a living man, even flies couldn\u2019t access it easily.In the backyard\u2026\u201cCome on.\u201d Song Jue stood with his hands on the back with an \u2018I am a superior cultivator\u2019 attitude. He said casually, \u201cKid, use your full strength, attack.\u201dYe Xiao\u2019s mouth twisted a little.[What? Full strength? Uncle Song, do you want me to send you to the gods today?I have taken a huge effort to save your life that day. Do you think you can just give it away so easily, really? Even if you don\u2019t want to live, I won\u2019t agree.]\u201cDon\u2019t hesitate. Don\u2019t use restraint.\u201d Song Jue thought that Ye Xiao was hesitating, so he encourage him, \u201cJust use your full strength.\u201dYet he didn\u2019t know what Ye Xiao exactly was thinking. [Should I still conceal my true strength? Actually, Uncle Song is not a stranger. He has been loyal all along. And he is a sworn brother to my father. He is absolutely on my side\u2026]Collecting his thoughts, he decided to reveal his true power a little bit, so as to let his men feel relief and stop worrying.Of course he couldn\u2019t reveal it all\u2026 If he was to truly use his full power\u2026 even if Song Jue was a supreme master of the Grade of Tianyuan, Ye Xiao could easily send him to hell.So he nodded and said, \u201cSince so, I will only have to accept it then. But please, Uncle Song, be careful\u2026\u201dSong Jue laughed as if he had just heard the most hilarious joke. He was amused and smiling, \u201cDon\u2019t worry kid. Even though you\u2019re capable enough to actually hurt me, you\u2019re still over 20 years away from being my opponent.\u201dYe Xiao nodded and spoke with admiration, \u201cIt turns out that Uncle Song is such a strong superior cultivator. You never show your strength in day to day activities. It is true that the greatest genius often lies concealed.\u201dSong Jue nodded with satisfaction. He almost smiled his teeth off. He said, \u201cCome on.\u201d\u201cOk.\u201dYe Xiao answered, and then struck immediately without hesitation.His body twisted, turning into a whirlwind. \u2013 Whoosh! \u2013 Only a dim shadow was left.\u2013 SHOOT! \u2013He was faster than lightning. In an instant, he had already arrived in front of Song Jue.Seeing the surprising turn of events occurring right in front of his face, Song Jue was terrified and shouted out, \u201cWhat the fxxk\u2026\u201dHe definitely hadn\u2019t expected \u2013 not even in his dreams \u2013 that his nephew could actually move so fast and his attack would actually be so sharp. He had actually broken the balance of time and space, making an incredible noise by distorting the nearby space.Song Jue felt that this wasn\u2019t ordinary attack, so he quickly operated his qi in order to defend against it.The most terrible mistake a superior cultivator could make was to underestimate the opponent. And that was what Song Jue had done just now. At this moment, he had fallen into an unexpected situation.In fact, he shouldn\u2019t be blamed for this. He had been weakened a lot because he had been suffering from the Golden Mai Palm. Now he was only at the ninth level of the Grade of Diyuan. However, with his true strength, even a cultivator of the Grade of Tianyuan would not be able to defeat him.And he had been through endless fights, so he was rather experienced in fighting. With all these advantages, it was reasonable for him to be confident while facing an inexperienced Ye Xiao.At the beginning, he was only thinking about testing Ye Xiao\u2019s capability; he never truly wanted to fight against him.After all, in his mind, the disparity between their capabilities was so massive that he didn\u2019t think there was need for him to be cautious.However, reality had brutally betrayed his expectations.A test had turned into true combat.Facing Ye Xiao\u2019s sharp attacks, he was forced to fight with utmost concentration. He fought well, but he had made a mistake already forcing him to defend in desperation. Although he had a higher level in cultivation, he couldn\u2019t save the situation that was caused by his own casualness.He had operated his qi in order to resist Ye Xiao\u2019s attack. But when the attack came, its strength was beyond his imagination.His chest suddenly suffered from a variety of strikes. He shouted out once again, \u201cOH FXXK!\u201d\u2013 Pah Pah Pah Pah Pah! \u2013At that moment, Ye Xiao had struck Song Jue\u2019s chest like a metal hammer several hundred times.And the winner of the combat was quickly decided.\u2013 Shoot! \u2013Ye Xiao turned over and stood on the ground. He waved his sleeves and stayed still.\u2013 Puff! \u2013On the other side, Song Jue flew out awkwardly for several meters. \u2013 Boom! \u2013 And then he stopped once he hit the wall. He stared at his nephew, shocked. His body was plastered on the wall, spread eagle. He finally slid down to the ground like a snake. \u2013 Puff. \u2013 He collapsed on the floor.With his mouth hanging open, he was looking at Ye Xiao with astonishment as he murmured, \u201cWhat\u2026 What\u2026 What was that? You you you\u2026 I\u2026 I\u2026 I\u2026\u201dAfter stuttering for a bit, he coughed. He stood up from the ground, tottering and staring at Ye Xiao as if he was looking at a monster.He could swear that he had never imagine that Ye Xiao could be so strong.[What was that?I was showing how a cultivator stands, and then he attacked, and I fell down like he was crushing dry weeds and smashing rotten wood.I didn\u2019t even have time to react.]Now he only had one thought, [Shit\u2026 That was so embarrassing\u2026 People say \u2018a boat capsizes in a calm sea [1]\u2019, yet it was not a boat which capsized; it was a bloody huge ship\u2026]Ye Xiao laughed and pulled him up. He said, \u201cThis martial art, I just learnt it recently. It is called Thunder Thousand Palm. How are you Uncle Song? Are you hurt? Is it sharp, my new martial art?\u201dSong Jue blushed and murmured, \u201cI was just not fully prepared just now. I was kind of unprepared\u2026 If I am well prepared, that would never happen. I was careless\u2026 Ahem\u2026 Of course, I kind of let loose you\u2026 I fell down myself on purpose\u2026\u201d\u201cSure. Of course.\u201d Ye Xiao said, \u201cWho are you? You are Uncle Song! You must have done that on purpose to make me feel confident. We all know that. No need to speak too much of it. We know that.\u201dSong Jue coughed. He hadn\u2019t blushed for decades, yet now he felt his cheeks burning. He said, \u201cHowever, as young as you are, you have such capability. That\u2019s not a normal thing. You are fine. You are good\u2026\u201dHe was wondering, [Thunder Thousand Palm? How come it sounds familiar to me? I seem to have heard of it before\u2026]He started going through his memories, trying to recollect where he had heard of the Thunder Thousand Palm before. He looked at Ye Xiao, \u201cWell then\u2026 Mu Cheng-Bai and the three assassins today, were they killed by you?\u201dYe Xiao smiled. He didn\u2019t answer the question directly, but said, \u201cUncle Song, let me walk you back to the house.\u201dHe didn\u2019t answer the question, but Song Jue understood. He was shocked and then felt gratified. He gave a thumbs up, \u201cGood man. You definitely are the son of Ye Nan-Tian. You have got guts.\u201dAnd then he waved his hand, \u201cNo need to walk with me. I am not that weak. With your low capability, even though you did make me fall over by chance, you could never hurt me.\u201dYe Xiao nodded, \u201cOf course not. That\u2019s obvious.\u201dSong Jue held his head high and walked in front of Ye Xiao like nothing had happened. He said, \u201cBy the way, when did you start training that martial art\u2026\u201d\u201cNot long ago. I was hanging around outside and saved an old man by chance\u2026\u201d BY now, Ye Xiao had become a specialist in making these kind of lies. He had made one in front of Prince Hua-Yang; now he was making another one. \u201cBut that old man was so ill. After he taught me a bit of this, he passed away. And then I tried it and felt it to be perfect for me. So I kept cultivating\u2026\u201d\u201cThat is more than not bad. Even I couldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d Song Jue stopped hurriedly. He coughed and said like an old sage, \u201cI was nearly defeated by that. It must be something extraordinary\u2026 It was your fortune. From now on, you should work harder on it. After working hard for a certain amount of time, you will be improved in an obvious way. You are young. You should accept what you are taught.

The crown prince had sent an invitation. He wants you to go to the Crown Prince\u2019s Palace for dinner tomorrow night\u2026 I think it is for the same topic we are discussing right now\u2026\u201dYe Xiao thought and nodded, \u201cI know. Don\u2019t worry, Uncle Song. If the crown prince dares to do anything to me, I will take care of him and his wife for good. I promise that no one will notice\u2026\u201d\u201cTake care of them for good\u2026\u201d Song Jue gave him a look filled with hopelessness. He couldn\u2019t help but have a coughing fit. He was furious, \u201cYou, you\u2026 you\u2026 Cough, cough,, cough, cough, cough, cough\u2026\u201d\u201cI am joking\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao quickly played off his previous statement as a joke.But in fact, he was thinking along the lines of, [Shit! The crown prince and his wife, dirty bitches. They always stand against me. Even if I slaughter them, so what?]Song Jue was speechless. He said, \u201cGo to the dining room. What to say and what to do, you make your own decisions. You have such capability now. That means you are in the Grade of Diyuan at least\u2026 Then I can be less worried. But don\u2019t you be reckless! You understand? Gosh\u2026 I am playing the harp to a cow [1]\u2026\u201dYe Xiao grinned cheekily and said, \u201cRelax, Uncle Song. I know the what to do.\u201d\u201cYou know shit\u2026\u201d Song Jue murmured before replying, \u201cFine then. Nothing else now. I need to check on the blood guards. They are always idle. Getting worse and worse now\u2026\u201d He left hurriedly with big paces.He didn\u2019t want to talk to Ye Xiao anymore. [What kind of human is he? Talking about slaughtering a crown prince and killing a crown princess\u2026 Shit. Even if you really want to do so, couldn\u2019t you just keep it under table\u2026\u201dAnd\u2026 I was so embarrassed!]As he walked, his face turned hotter.[That was truly embarrassing\u2026 Am I still the Vital Blade?I actually got beaten up by a sixteen year old kid with a single wave of attack\u2026I, I, I\u2026 I really should find a tree and hang myself from it\u2026It is lucky that the kid is my brother\u2019s son, not a stranger. Otherwise I have to end my disgraceful like for good\u2026]He turned around a corner and made sure Ye Xiao wasn\u2019t following him. And then he sat on the floor and rubbed his chest, \u201c\u2026 Ouch\u2026 Bloody hell\u2026 That hurt me to death\u2026 The little prick was really good. He actually hit on my chest with 178 strikes of the fists\u2026 Every hit was the real deal\u2026 I almost spat out blood\u2026 That seriously hurt\u2026 I thought my bones were about to break\u2026\u201dWhen rubbing his chest, a blood guard turned around the corner and saw him like that. The guard was shocked, \u201cChief! What happened to you? Who beat you up?\u201dHe then rushed forward to help Song Jue.Song Jue blushed and stood up instantly, \u201cYou jerk! You are talking nonsense! What do you mean beating me up? In the whole Chen-Xing City, do you really think there is anyone who can beat me up? I was just\u2026 feeling a little bit breathless\u2026 So I rubbed my chest for a while\u2026 Are you blind\u2026\u201dThe guard was confused and stared at him. He stammered, \u201cBut\u2026 Obviously you looked like you were beaten up\u2026 Look at the dirt on your clothes. Even on your butt\u2026\u201dSong Jue turned angry because he was exposed by the guard. He jumped up ,caught the guard\u2019s ear and gave it an almighty twist. He was furious, \u201cYou bastard. Do you even know how to talk\u2026 You, you, you\u2026 You are driving me crazy\u2026 Come and let me teach you how to be a smart man\u2026 You have been a moron most of your life and you are still as stupid as a pig\u2026\u201dThen he dragged the guard and left.\u2026One the other side, Ye Xiao was concentrating on eavesdropping on Song Jue\u2019s conversation with the guard. Now that he had caught the conversation, he couldn\u2019t stop a delightful smile from appearing on his face. He felt relieved and returned to his room.Then he took out his Divine Weapon with the Demonic Edge!\u201cDeep Sea Frigid Metal huh\u2026\u201d He was looking at the 108 needles and 12 knives lying in front of him. He was feeling the coldness being emitted from the weapons and a mysterious smile showed up on his face, \u201cIf it really is only the Deep Sea Frigid Metal\u2026 how could it possibly exhaust a smithing master\u2019s life? Besides there are no tips on these\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Deep Sea Frigid Metal is a precious metal indeed, but how could it possibly contain such power.\u201d\u201cMost importantly, weapons that made from the Deep Sea Frigid Metal could never deserve the title of \u2018Divine Weapon with Demonic Edge\u2019! There must be something hidden within these. If I am right\u2026\u201dHe picked up a needle and held it in his hand. He operated the scorching hot power of the East-rising Purple Qi!Suddenly, his hand became incredibly hot. That cold needle was wrapped inside the heat. Yet, he could still feel a slight coldness emitting from the needle.That was the speciality of the Deep Sea Frigid Metal.Yet Ye Xiao didn\u2019t let go of the suspicion in his mind.So he continued increasing the heat using more power.Gradually, the whole room became hot like hell.Finally, a crystal like glow started to show up on the needle. The surface of the needle started to melt and peel off. Its true appearance finally emerged.Hidden underneath the Deep Sea Frigid Metal exterior was a crystal material, dark like ink but shiny like the stars in the night sky!When the hidden material showed up, an aura of death that belonged in the depths hell started spreading out slowly. It had an indescribable aura of coldness\u2026 That coldness didn\u2019t belonging to the mortal world!Ye Xiao stared at that special material with his sharp eyes and murmured, \u201cI knew it\u2026 It is not the Deep Sea Frigid Metal! Something else is hidden within!\u201dHis eyes were sharp as he looked at the needle in his hand, murmuring, \u201cThe aura of slaughtering and destruction can only be emitted by one material in the universe!\u201d\u201cThat is Sky Demonic Steel!\u201dWhile he was talking, the surface of the needle had melted completely. The dark and shiny needle was completely uncovered.A aura of destruction was forming around it.It was like the demons from hell were ready to do something evil. Once they got a chance, they would keep killing until they slaughtered and swallowed the whole world!\u201cIt is the Sky Demonic Steel!\u201d Ye Xiao felt relieved, \u201cOnly something like this could possibly make a smithing master spend all his life to temper it!\u201d\u201cOnly, the aura of death around the Sky Demonic Steel causes it to reject all other metals. Because of this, no other metals could be used to make the tips!\u201d\u201cThe Sky Demonic Steel needed to be covered by the Deep Sea Frigid Metal. If it had remained uncovered and people kept held it long enough, their minds would be affected, turning them into mindless demons!\u201d\u201cOnly the weapons made from the Sky Demonic Steel are qualified enough to be called\u2026 the Divine Weapons with Demonic Edge!\u201d\u201cNow that I have revealed its true face in my hand, it means\u2026 I can slaughter the whole universe with these weapons in my hand!\u201dYe Xiao took a deep breath.He held the Demonic Needle in his hand and entered the Spaces.The Demonic Needle had entered the Spaces with him too. Ye Xiao looked at the small pile of Spiritual Essence of Gold and walked to it without hesitation.\u2013 Shoot! \u2013 The Demonic Needle flew into the Spiritual Essence of Gold automatically, it started to glow.\u201cThey are not unfinished. They are fully developed. But\u2026 they just need the Spiritual Essence of Gold to sharpen them. Only after that can they become the real Demonic Edge. The Sky Demonic Steel is not suitable for making tips of needles and knives\u2026\u201dAt the moment, the shiny glow on the Demonic Needle had disappeared.Ye Xiao waved his hand and the needle returned to his hand.Only this time, the needle had a long and narrow tip.It was shining a indescribable glow of cold!The needle was like nature itself with no flaws!The throwing needle, finished!\u201cI knew it!\u201d A satisfied look appeared in Ye Xiao\u2019s eyes.After that, Ye Xiao started to repeat the same process on the other needles. He took a needle and then operated the East-rising Purple Qi to melt the surface, and then he got into the Spaces to create the tip\u2026Because his cultivation of East-rising Purple Qi was at a low level, he could only work on one needle at a time. As for the 12 knives, as they had a larger size than the needles, he was unable to develop them till now!Even so, he was rather satisfied!The ultimate weapon that only existed in the legends was now in his grasp. That was already a huge fortune! Even though he could only develop one at a time, it was good enough for him. He only needed to be patient and spent more time on it and he could naturally get all the needles and knives finished.\u201cThe point is that it could be done!\u201d Ye Xiao rubbed the sweat on his forehead.While he was operating one after another, the East-rising Purple Qi was becoming purer and purer, sharper and sharper. And its strength seemed to be increasing\u2026Not long after, he could also create the sharpened edges of the knives!He was so concentrated on working on the weapons that he didn\u2019t even notice the time flying by.He also didn\u2019t notice that with a large amount of the qi in his body being consumed, the qi in the Spaces was rushing into his Jing and Mai like a tidal wave. As for the the purple qi in the universe\u2026They were continuously replenishing his energy.During the process, Ye Xiao was extremely focused. That was why he had already reached the rare situation of \u2018harmony between man and nature\u2019.Both his spiritual and mental power were increasing rapidly\u2026He was consuming his energy to unveil all the Divine Weapons with Demonic Edges. The massive amount of qi in the Space was replenishing his energy continuously. That became a delicate cycle. The Spaces seemed to be at a disadvantageous situation, as it kept offering qi without any returns\u2026Ye Xiao was working in full flow. He didn\u2019t know that everyone in the house of Ye felt that it was extraordinarily hot that night\u2026\u2026\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu[1] Play the harp to a cow (\u5bf9\u725b\u5f39\u7434), means choosing the wrong audience that would never be understanding.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013This is the third guaranteed chapter of the week.Translated by :- RainEdited by :- AlphaPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Ye Xiao was continuously operating the scorching hot power of the East-rising Purple Qi. Even though it was only operated in a small range, the small streams of heat kept spreading and increased the temperature in the house.However, nobody had time to find out the reason, because there was something else going on in the house at the same time.All the blood guards were training under the compelling eyes of Song Jue. They were all complaining and sweating and they didn\u2019t realize that reason they were sweating so badly was because of Ye Xiao\u2026A voice had been resounding in the house during the entire night, \u201cLook at your stupid faces. You just have moved for a short while and you are sweating all over. Don\u2019t you feel ashamed? Are you still the blood guards? Are you still feeling proud to call yourselves the blood guards? From now on, all of you, kept taking the full-strength training for one month. Next time when I check on you, if you are still this weak, pack your stuffs and get the hell off\u2026\u201dIn fact, with Song Jue\u2019s capability, he was able to sense the unusual rise in temperature. It was seriously hot. Yet, he just used it as an excuse to give the guys a lesson\u2026Besides, as he had been humiliated so bad, he simply wanted to vent his anger to them\u2026Ye Xiao had been busy till the next morning. He stretched himself and took a deep breath. He looked at the 108 needles and the 12 knives in front of him. Each piece of weaponry was dark and shiny\u2026The result after the night of hard work was not only remarkable, but also surprising. It took Ye Xiao a lot of effort to develop each needle. At the beginning, every time after he finish one needle, he needed to wait and recover a bit of his qi to continue with the next one.To melt and temper the Deep Sea Frigid Metal, a continuous flow of energy was required. If he stopped during the development of one needle, it would cause the energy to flow in reverse. The knives were much bigger than needles in scale, so he thought that he couldn\u2019t handle them. He was afraid that this one night would not be enough to sharpen them.Yet after finishing the needles, he became more proficient. He could do the same amount of work by consuming lesser amount of energy. With the enormous amount of qi from the Spaces being sent to him, he had even developed a knife. So he didn\u2019t stop and worked on the knives one after another. Finally, he finished all the needles and knives.The tips of the needles and knives were completed.Under the light, they were all shining with a cold glow.They looked like they were made from an inferno to slaughter and seek blood.They were filled with the aura of extreme danger.\u201cThe Divine Weapons with Demonic Edges finally show up, but that is not finished yet\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao rubbed his jaw and murmured, leaving the sweat dripping down his cheeks, \u201cThey still need to be disguised anyway\u2026 They are so dark, that if I use them at day time, it would leave traces for sure. That is eye-catching. Really\u2026\u201d\u201cTo make them truly invisible, I am going to need some Colorless Gold\u2026 But I don\u2019t have that. Even if I do, I won\u2019t be able to develop them into that stage with my present capability.\u201dHe sighed, \u201cI guess they can stay how they are for now.\u201dHe took off the band that was used to bind his hair and it hang down loosely. There was a mirror in front of him.He looked into the mirror. He had red lips, white teeth, jade-like pretty face, prominent nose, double-fold eyelids, long eyebrows\u2026[I am so freaking handsome with the look right now. With my long hair hanging down, I can be the number 1 handsome guy in the world.] Ye Xiao thought. And then he bound his hair into a new hairstyle.It was a coiled knot on the head that was a little bit askew.Actually, men were all required to bind their hair decently. They wouldn\u2019t be allowed to show up with hair disheveled. Yet Ye Xiao had tied his hair in a skewed coiled knot and a few strands of hair were hanging down to his neck on his left.That made him look more like a foppish black sheep than he he was before. It was a look filled with unruliness and evilness.\u201cIt is much better now.\u201d Ye Xiao looked into the mirror and spoke gladly, \u201cThat is unique. I shall keep my hair this way\u2026 How convenient.\u201dThe Xiao Monarch was not only talking about how the way he bound his hair was convenient.He picked up the needles and put them into his hair knot from different directions one after one. The needles were dark and his hair was dark too. Not a single piece of the needles could be seen through his hair.Hidden inside his hair, they were difficult to find. Even the gods wouldn\u2019t notice them. The needles were flawlessly camouflaged.Ye Xiao bent down, stepped aside, got on the floor, lowered his head, turned his head\u2026 He made more than a hundred gestures. For some of them, he used his hands, while most of them were simply moves of the head.The threads of hair on his head kept fluttering up and down, left and right\u2026 There was always some of the threads of hair covering the knot\u2026\u201cThat\u2019s acceptable. With that, I can be sure in anytime anywhere, no matter what I do, nobody will notice when I throw the needles out.\u201d He nodded with satisfaction, \u201cBut there are not enough spaces for all the needles\u2026 There can only be 12 needles. Rooms must be kept for the knives somehow\u2026\u201dAfter that, he cautiously put one needle on the skin of the inside of his left wrist tightly, and then he covered it with something which looked like his skin. Suddenly it looked exactly like his skin, fully covering the needle. Most importantly, there was no embossment of the needle.That skin-like strange material was something Ye Xiao bought recently when he was hanging around the market. It was normally used to make the skin masks.The skin masks that were made from this material made people feel uncomfortable wearing them, and they were easy to be exposed. However, on the wrist, this material worked perfectly well. Nobody would notice it.And then he did the same thing with his right wrist.And then the left ankle, right ankle, both sides of the waist, each of these place held a needle.That made it 18 needles hidden on his body.He then took out 12 of the remaining 90 needles and put them into a small needle bag. He threw the other 78 needles into the Space of Gold.The needle bag was mostly used as a distraction. The others hidden on his body were for the emergency use if he got into any unexpected situation.The real killing ones were the 78 needles inside the Spaces. He could hold the needles in hand by only operating his mind. That was the most convenient way to make a strike\u2026The two of the 12 knives were hidden in his hair while the rests were all kept in the Spaces.Finally he finished dealing with all these weapons. He started to move, to do actions, until he made sure the needles and knives were completely well covered no matter how he moved. He opened the door to his room and rushed to the watchtower.Because in fifteen minutes, it would be the time when the purple qi in the whole world would rise. It was the best moment for cultivating the East-Rising Purple Qi and Ye Xiao would never let it fleet away.Song Jue was just walking toward Ye Xiao. Ye Xiao was preparing to greet him, but he only saw Song Jue walked away from him with his head lowered murmuring, \u201cWhat else do I still need to do?\u201dHe looked like he was lost in thoughts and walked away\u2026Ye Xiao nearly bursted into laughing.The steward, his uncle was now rather hilarious to him. When he was only a steward, he criticized everything about Ye Xiao. Now he was an uncle, yet he ran away when he came across Ye Xiao\u2026Ye Xiao heard a guard speaking, \u201cOh, chief. Was that our young master in front of you? Yet you didn\u2019t even say hello?\u201dSong Jue spoke hurriedly, \u201cOh really? Really? Really\u2026 Why didn\u2019t I notice? Never mind. I can see him every day. I am busy. You guys are busy\u2026\u201d Then his voice went far away.Finally, Ye Xiao couldn\u2019t help bursting into laughter. [My Uncle Steward is truly adorable.]If Song Jue could hear Ye Xiao at the moment, he would be embarrassed. Of course he could do nothing about it, but he would definitely vent his anger on the poor blood guard, as the guards were all easy targets to bully.It was the afternoon. Ye Xiao was going to attend the dinner arranged set by the crown prince.He didn\u2019t consider too much about the meeting. He decided to accept the situation.The crown prince huh?In the Xiao Monarch\u2019s heart, honestly\u2026 that meant nothing. He was just a fart.As he had said earlier, if the crown prince dared to do anything to him, he would slaughter both him and his wife.He had nothing to be concerned about.Why did he need to worry about something like a fart?The sky quickly turned dark. Ye Xiao rode on his horse, his clothes fluttering, his hair dancing in the wind; He looked dashing. He rode to the Crown Prince\u2019s Palace.On the way to the Crown Prince\u2019s, he paused to buy a bag of fruits before continuing his journey.Lan Lang-Lang happened to show up during his ride and came towards him, \u201cXiao Xiao, where are you heading?\u201dYe Xiao laughed, \u201cThe crown prince invited me to dinner. I am going to get a couple of drinks. Are you coming? Did he invite you?\u201dLan Lang-Lang was sad, \u201cNo, he didn\u2019t. Why did he invite you but not me\u2026\u201dYe Xiao left.After travelling a long distance, a guy on a horse came over, \u201cXiao Xiao, where are you going?\u201dThe guy talked loudly. It was Zuo Wu-Ji.\u201cThe crown prince invites me to dinner. I am going to get some drinks.\u201d Ye Xiao shouted.\u201cAh?\u201d Zuo Wu-Ji suddenly felt admiring, \u201cThe crown prince invites you to dinner? What for?\u201dThere were a lot of people on the street. They all looked to Ye Xiao with admiring eyes, [The crown prince invites him to dinner? No shit!]Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euYe Xiao laughed and spoke enrapturing, \u201cYou are asking a silly question. The crown prince invited me. Surely he wants to talked with me about some national affairs. Now it is an eventful time for the kingdom. That is obvious.\u201dZuo Wu-Ji started singing praises, \u201cThat so. I am in admiration. Brother Ye is indeed the mainstay of our kingdom.\u201d\u2026Translated by \u2013 RainEdited by \u2013 AlphaPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He didn\u2019t invite Lang-Lang too. It seems that the Crown Prince only invited me. Hahahahaha. The Crown Prince sure has sincerity\u2026\u201dZuo Wu-Ji\u2019s face turned green, \u201cYes. Yes. He values you a lot\u2026\u201d\u201cAhahahahahah\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao stroked his horse and left in a flash.So, all along his way, everyone came to know that\u2026 the son of the great General Ye, Ye Xiao, was invited to dinner by the Crown Prince to discuss some troublesome national affairs.\u201cWhy would the Crown Prince invite that foppish lord for dinner? He is one of the \u2018three lords in town\u2019. What kind of national affair could the Crown Prince discuss with him\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh. You don\u2019t know shit! He is a foppish fool indeed, but his father, General Ye is not\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Crown Prince invited Ye Xiao for dinner. Would he be doing this for anything else? You know, although Ye Xiao is a foppish fool, he really has a pretty face\u2026\u201d\u201cWell that\u2026 Heh heh heh\u2026 Better not gossip\u2026\u201d\u201cOh. It just came out from my heart. We shouldn\u2019t gossip indeed. Hahahaha\u2026\u201d\u201cEr huh. Er huh.\u201d\u2026It was in the Crown Prince\u2019s Palace.The Crown Princess was in a white mourning dress. She was sitting on the chair and her eyes were cold. It made her look pretty and delicate.\u201cIs Ye Xiao coming soon?\u201d In her eyes, there existed an aura of hostility.[My brother just died.He might have perished at the hands of Ye Xiao; maybe not\u2026But it was because of Ye Xiao after all.My uncle brought people of my clan to take revenge, yet eight of the men died in the house of Ye.And then all our men in the capital died outside the city wall. All dead\u2026With such intense and deep-seated hatred, how could I just let it go!]\u201cVery soon.\u201d The Crown Prince frowned and said, \u201cThe truth will be revealed tonight\u2026 Take it easy.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care about the truth. He must die!\u201d The Crown Princess wore an expression of madness, she was desperate for blood. Her pretty face was already a little bit twisted. Her hatred for Ye Xiao had seeped deep into her bones.\u201cIs it really necessary?!\u201d The Crown Prince was displeased and countered, \u201cWe don\u2019t know what exactly had happened. It might not be Ye Xiao\u2019s fault. Even if he wanted to do those things, he doesn\u2019t have that capability.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care. Even if he didn\u2019t do it, I want him dead!\u201d The Crown Princess gritted her teeth.The Crown Prince held his forehead and frowned. He was annoyed, \u201cYou are unbelievable!\u201d\u201cWould my brother die if not because of him? How would dozens of men from our clan come here if not because of him? If they didn\u2019t come, they wouldn\u2019t have been killed! If not because of him, how could the four guards of mine die?\u201d The Crown Princess shouted, not at all willing to listen to reason.The Crown Prince sighed and murmured, \u201cYou have gone mad\u2026\u201d He turned around and left.When he was about to go through the door, a guard reported, \u201cYour highness, Ye Xiao is heading to the Crown Prince\u2019s Palace. He is proudly telling everyone on the way that the Crown Prince has invited him for dinner to discuss national affairs\u2026 So far, people in every place he has passed has become aware of it now. They all believe that Ye Xiao is coming here to have dinner and discuss national affairs\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe Crown Prince heard him and staggered. His face turned green and he cursed in a low voice, \u201cBastard!\u201dBehind him, the Crown Princess was opening her mouth. She was also astonished\u2026[This Ye Xiao is truly surprising, isn\u2019t he?Nothing happened yet, and he had told the world everything.Now in the whole capital, whoever has ears knows about this news!I invited you for dinner?!Yes, fine. Even though I have invited you for dinner, when the hell did I say anything about national affairs? You foppish prick! What national affair could I possibly discuss with you? Are you underestimating my IQ, or are you just a moron?]The Crown Prince was upset.\u201cThis Ye Xiao is really detestable! Does he think that after he spreads such rumors, we will not do anything to hurt him? Who the hell does he think he is?!\u201d The Crown Princess\u2019s face was full of hatred. The killing intent in her voice was undisguised.\u201cWe cannot do anything to him indeed. He is the only son of Ye Nan-Tian. That\u2019s enough to be a reason\u2026\u201d The Crown Prince rubbed his head because of a headache.\u201cSo that\u2019s the first reason we cannot do anything to him. The second one is\u2026 I am afraid there is a very wise man supporting him. We have to make another plan if we are to go against him!\u201dThe Crown Prince smiled bitterly, \u201cThe force of the foppish fool is something we cannot underestimate\u2026 He just told something to people and it is causing us trouble\u2026\u201dSpeaking of that, he was suddenly enlightened. A thought entered his mind, [Maybe, Ye Xiao is not really a stupid foppish young lord; in fact he is very smart!]\u201cThe situation is quite clear. People who already know of our attitude towards him certainly know about the purpose of my invitation. Yet for those who barely know the truth, they would certainly hold a question in mind. \u2018To cozy up to the son of a great general, what does the Crown Prince intend to do?\u2019 My two younger brothers must be paying attention to us now.\u201dHe smiled, \u201cThis Lord Ye made such a move. It is awesome really. On the surface he is showing off that he is invited by me. In fact he was thinking deeper than that. He is getting us into trouble. It can keep him safe. At the same time he can rather enjoy the dinner this time\u2026 That is not some ordinary strategy.\u201dThe Crown Princess frowned and spoke lightly, \u201cEnjoy? I will see what a smart guy this Ye Xiao is! I want to see how he can enjoy at our place!\u201dShe spoke with gritted teeth.\u2026After a while, someone reported.\u201cYour highness. Ye Xiao is at the gate.\u201dThe Crown Prince was in high spirits and said, \u201cOpen the gate. Show Lord Ye in. I will be greeting him in the middle hall.\u201dThe Crown Princess humphed, \u201cI am going too.\u201dBoth of them prepared to greet Ye Xiao. It seemed they were showing great respect to him.However, they were surely not intending to show respect\u2026They stood at the entrance to the middle hall and they saw a guy wearing in white coming over from the gate.Following the guard, he was swinging along. He looked like he was trying to show an attitude of \u2018I am calm\u2019, \u2018I am handsome\u2019, \u2018I am indifferent\u2019. Yet within, he couldn\u2019t help feeling proud.The Crown Prince and Crown Princess heard the guy\u2019s voice coming over, \u201cI really never thought that the Crown Prince would invite me for dinner. Hahahaha\u2026 That is in fact very reasonable. I am standing high in the city right now\u2026 I have read much for all my years. I know clearly about tactics and battles. I know all about all about the ancient philosophers. I have always been hiding my talent. That\u2019s all\u2026 Hahaha. I thought I lacked scope for my abilities and I should just waste my talent for this life. Yet the Crown Prince really has a pair of sharp eyes. He can see the best out of the ordinary. He can just find the best man no matter where he is. The real gold will shine anyway. Hahahahaha\u2026\u201dHis voice sounded humble at the beginning. Yet he failed to keep it that way. He had sprouted a pair of wings at the end. One didn\u2019t need to look at him; only by hearing what he had said, one could easily imagine what he looked like at the moment.If he didn\u2019t have the two balls between his legs, he would have flown up to the air already\u2026The Crown Prince\u2019s face immediately turned blue.[You? Read much? Know about tactics and battles?Hiding your talent?You are\u2026 the best?Real gold will shine among the shit\u2026I am the Crown Prince so I am not allowed to curse. But I am about to lose control now!]The Crown Princess\u2019s face was twisting ever so slowly.[Such a stupid man could really kill my brother?! Or\u2026 my brother could die because of him?That really is an injustice\u2026]While Ye Xiao came closer, they finally saw the face of the Lord Ye.He had a hair knot on his head. It seemed he had tried to bind it well, yet it was a bit skew somehow\u2026 A little bit skewed though; not a lot\u2026It looked weird anyway.He didn\u2019t bind up all his hair. He left some threads hanging to his left shoulder. The hair came down along his left cheek, dangling, giving off an aura of wickedness.The weird hair type had already made the Crown Prince and the Crown Princess feel odd.The weird hair type was truly\u2026 unique in the world!And then they looked at his face\u2026 Hmm. He was handsome, with long eyebrows, big and vigorous eyes, sharp nose, pretty face, small and pink lips on his mouth\u2026He was dressed in white, which made him look elegant. Hmm. If he was not walking in obvious splayfoot way and swinging his body, he could be much better looking\u2026\u201cLord Ye.\u201d The Crown Prince raised his hand to show his greeting.\u201cAhahaha\u2026 The Crown Prince. Your highness. I have heard many praises about you. It is my fortune to finally meet you today.\u201d Ye Xiao greeted seriously with a face full of smiles, \u201cIt is said that in dangerous situation, it shows the true hearts of men, while in an unstable period, it reveals the loyalty of men. You can invite me for dinner at this troublesome period. There must be something important you want to discuss with me? Don\u2019t worry. I will tell everything I know and give you my true opinions\u2026 I will try my best to exclude the difficulty and anxiety, your highness.\u201dHe looked rather sincere with a humble voice. He looked like he was in a state of \u2018a man will die for his bosom friend and I owe you for being understanding and treating me well\u2019 kind of attitude.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe raised his hand and showed the bag of fruit to them, \u201cYour highness. There is a small gift for you for this first honored meeting. It is a bag of fruits. The saying is quite good, that when dropping in, one needs a gift for the meeting\u2026 Heh heh. I have tried the fruit. They are quite fresh and delicious.

You actually brought all these things that are only worth 3 wen as a gift to the great Crown Prince\u2019s Palace?And you actually asked our great Crown Prince\u2026 to accept it?Accept your ass!]The Crown Prince felt his face become stiff. He wanted to smile, but he couldn\u2019t. He forcibly curled his mouth into a painful smile and said, \u201cPlease come in, Lord Ye.\u201d\u201cYour highness, you are being conventional by saying that.\u201d Ye Xiao laughed brightly. On the other hand, he wasn\u2019t being conventional at all. He casually put the fruit basket into a guard\u2019s arms and said, \u201cYou go. Put them away for the Crown Prince. These are real fine stuff\u2026\u201dThe guard was stunned and stood there doing nothing. He looked at the fruit in his arms and didn\u2019t know whether he should take them or not.Ye Xiao had already turned around to talk to the Crown Prince. He laughed and spoke, \u201cI am here already. Of course I will get in\u2026 Hahaha. I wonder what kind of fine liquor you have prepared, your highness\u2026\u201dWith that, he entered the door without hesitation and said, \u201cIt is well said that all lands belong to the king and all men should bow to the king\u2026 The royal family are the richest people in the world. They have a lot of good liquor, good food, precious animals. I heard that the Crown Prince had invited me to dinner, so I stopped eating since the noon of yesterday\u2026 I wanted to save room for today\u2019s feast. The gods have truly granted my wish. Hahahaha\u2026 I am going to eat till my stomach bursts!\u201dHe paced forward slowly and noticed the presence of the Crown Princess when he got close. He was surprised. He took a deep breath and stared at her pretty face. He praised, \u201cThis must be our Crown Princess\u2026 Heh heh. Greetings. Our Crown Prince is truly a lucky man. I have heard that the Crown Princess has been the No. 1 beauty in the capital for a long time. Now as I see her with my own eyes, I have to admit, it is true. She is even more beautiful than described\u2026 What a beauty. Heh heh\u2026 heh heh heh\u2026 You must enjoy your life with such a beautiful wife, your highness\u2026\u201dWhile speaking, he looked up and down on the Crown Princess\u2019s face with a randy look. It was like he had lost 150 grams in the weight of bones when seeing such a beauty\u2026After looking at the face, he looked at her boobs. After that, he looked down a bit, inspecting her all the way to her feet, and then looked again from her feet to her face\u2026He acted like he was choosing a whore in a brothel\u2026 Yet he didn\u2019t say \u2018take off your clothes and let me take a close look\u2019. If he had said so, it would have been perfect!Of course, he had been a virgin for such a long time, so he wasn\u2019t able to say that\u2026 It was not easy for him to pretend to be a randy guy.The Crown Princess frowned and finally couldn\u2019t bear it. She spoke with disdain, \u201cLord Ye, please behave yourself.\u201dThe Crown Prince was truly unhappy at the moment.[Why is this guy so sick?Don\u2019t you know who a Crown Princess is? Do you really think you can treat her like that?!]Ye Xiao was indifferent. He laughed loudly and spoke to the Crown Princess, \u201cYou invited me here. We should be like a family. Your highness, hey hey\u2026 You are so pretty\u2026\u201d He looked at her neck and thought, [Her neck is so thin. I can just break it with two fingers, can\u2019t I? \u2026]The guards standing aside were all pissed when they heard him. Their faces started showing anger and they started releasing an intimidating aura.[Bastard! Three of our men died because of him and one is missing. Now he has come to the Crown Prince\u2019s Palace, yet he actually said those dirty words to our Crown Princess? He is too overweening and unscrupulous!He is truly bodacious.]\u201cLord Ye.\u201d A middle-aged man with three long threads of sideburns looked at Ye Xiao sullenly, \u201cThis is the Crown Prince\u2019s Palace. Please show some respect.\u201dYe Xiao was still indifferent. He turned his head casually and laughed, \u201cThat\u2019s fine. That\u2019s ok. Please get in, guys. Make yourselves at home.\u201d He was telling people to get in, yet he walked into the middle hall before them.The guards outside the door, the Crown Prince, the Crown Princess and their trusted subordinates were all speechless and felt sullen.They were all well-informed people and they had seen shameless men, but they had never seen someone who could be so shameless so openly\u2026This was shamelessness of an incredible level!It is true that there is always a better man while there is always a higher sky; there is always a man who is more capable and there is always a man who is more shameless!\u201cA man knows nothing about the height of the sky and the thickness of the land. A shameless and ignorant person.\u201d The middle-aged man shook his head. He felt annoyed that he had to stay with Ye Xiao.People sighed and nodded. They all felt that it was quite a decrement of their personal value to be ordered to interact such a foppish fool. They wondered what the Crown Prince was thinking\u2026[Let all the best of us be with Ye Xiao is simply letting the white snow comer in contact with a piece of shit\u2026That is so disappointing!]Only the oldest man among them reacted differently. He frowned tightly and sighed gently. He was collecting thoughts, [I am afraid this Lord Ye is not ignorant. Nor shameless\u2026He is extremely confident so that he doesn\u2019t see any of us in his eyes. He is unbridled and unruly!]He was the only one who had such thought. And he didn\u2019t think that it was a good time to state it.So he kept it in his mind, [I should act carefully. I need to observe more\u2026 What makes him so arrogant?\u201d]And then he entered the hall after everyone else.When everyone was seated, Xe Yiao decided to stir up some trouble.Ye Xiao looked at the seat that was arranged for him and then stood up. He spoke to a man who sat on one of the host\u2019s seats and said, \u201cCould you introduce yourself please?\u201d\u201cThis is the first brain truster of the Crown Prince, the world-shocking Master Guan Zheng-Wen.\u201d A middle-aged man was introduced with a sullen face.\u201cEr\u2026 Pleasure to meet you\u2026 And I hope you don\u2019t mind please, but who are you?\u201d Ye Xiao changed his target.\u201cI am Meng Zi-Xiao, just a soldier. I don\u2019t think you have heard about me.\u201d Men Zi-Xiao spoke blandly.Men Zi-Xiao was a well-known gifted youth in the Kingdom of Chen. The man had done well in the recruiting tests of the court. He had passed five of the six tests before failing the last one, in which he hadn\u2019t pleased the king. So he missed the first place and only got the second. He was rather talented, yet he was grundy. He always sought revenge even for the smallest grievance. The king didn\u2019t like him and so, he wasn\u2019t selected to work in the court. However, the Crown Prince had recruited him. He really was a capable man.As for the words \u2018I don\u2019t think you have heard about me\u2019, he was being humble to in order to be recognized and praised. Deep in his heart he was thinking, [You must have heard of me.]Yet he had never thought that Ye Xiao would nodded and said, \u201cNo I haven\u2019t\u2026 Calling yourself \u2018just a soldier\u2019 truly shows your good self-awareness. Heh heh\u2026\u201d\u201cYou! \u2026\u201d Meng Zi-Xiao suddenly felt his throat plug up. His eyes were wide opened with fury.[I am just being modest\u2026 I didn\u2019t expect such a rude reply, did I?]\u201cDo you mind if I ask you\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao already ignored Meng Zi-Xiao, who was so angry that his face turned purple. He was asking another man already.With the same way, he had asked all the people at the table. Finally he said, \u201cThat is strange\u2026 Today the Prince invites me for dinner. And basically I am the only guest here. You all serve here. How come you all sit up there? While I am sitting down here? Is that how the Crown Prince treats his guests? That\u2019s really enigmatical!\u201dHe shook head continuously. He looked very displeased by the way the Crown Prince did things. He gave the impression that he was thinking along the lines of \u2018he is not a wise man and he doesn\u2019t deserve my service\u2026\u2019.When he said that, all the people sitting there wanted to beat him to death immediately![Treat you politely? Are you kidding?Enigmatical?How so?!]In fact, he had his point. [You are all in the same group and I am the only guest here. I am invited. It is inappropriate to let me sit down here, isn\u2019t it?]Ye Xiao\u2019s \u2018reasonable\u2019 points had obviously aroused the anger of the people. The Crown Prince\u2019s men were all furious and the Crown Prince himself was pissed.As a Crown Prince, it was a normal to invite capable men for dinner. That was actually quite common. He had invited so many people, yet he never arranged the seats in respect to the relations of host and guests.The men here were serving the Crown Prince. That was true. In fact, every one of them was a well-known man in some places. They were all extraordinary people. Even the great officers in the court had been seated the same way. It had become an unwritten rule. [You ignorant fool! He is actually choosy about it!]However, they couldn\u2019t speak out their minds. Ye Xiao\u2019s argument seemed to be right. Whoever wanted to reason with him would only disgrace himself!Facing Ye Xiao\u2019s speaking, people were all furious, yet no one dared to open the mouth. The situation turned into a waiting game.People didn\u2019t talk, yet it didn\u2019t mean Ye Xiao stopped would stop talking too.\u201cThat is really short of sincerity. Truly.\u201d Ye Xiao shook his head and sighed, \u201cI am a guest of the Crown Prince anyway. I am a remarkable talent. I know all about battles and strategies. I know a lot about geography. I have capabilities to bring peace to the kingdom\u2026 Yet I didn\u2019t even get a decent treatment? What does that mean!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euPeople were furiously glaring at him. They were pretty upset.\u2026This is the first regular chapter of the week.Translated by \u2013 RainEdited by \u2013 AlphaPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 84 \u2013 InterrogationThose guys in the hall were all well educated people. They were talkative. They could speak for several hours without a stop. Yet they had lost their voices when it came to speaking against Ye Xiao.The situation was really hard to handle. It had turned into an awkward and embarrassing situation.After being quiet for a while, the old man Guan Zheng-Wen stood up and smiled. He spoke with a deep voice, \u201cI was sitting there to have a word with the Crown Prince. Now that I am finished, I should naturally move aside\u2026 Lord Ye, this seat is saved for you. We were all seated early and there was no other empty seat. I am too old to stand for a long time, so I sat on your seat. You wouldn\u2019t mind, would you? Hahahaha\u2026\u201dAn older ginger was spicier [1]. He had quickly managed to turn the situation around.Ye Xiao laughed and didn\u2019t go on dragging the issue. He just sat on the seat provided without any hesitation.He now sat less than three meters from the Crown Prince.He was surely not making trouble without any purpose. He was simply setting himself up to execute the backup plan smoothly, [If you pricks dare to mess with me, I will kill you both instantly without hesitation!]In the present situation, he wouldn\u2019t care much about who he was dealing with.That seat was the perfect location for him to take action, so it was naturally something he had to seize! He was sure that to attack from this location, even if all the supreme cultivators were to act, they would have no chance to save the Crown Prince!The other guys didn\u2019t know that inside the foppish young lord\u2019s mind was a shocking and regicidal idea.As the situation had been set up as such, these guys could only curse him in their minds and silently take their seats again.After three rounds of drinks and five courses of meals, the crown prince coughed to draw attention.Everyone stopped their chopsticks. They knew that the main topic of the night was about to be addressed. They were all quiet as they prepared to listen to the Crown Prince, hoping to see a good show.However, the Lord Ye was still devouring his food like a beast. He grabbed the food on the table and ate as he wished. His cheeks were plumped. His chopsticks were moving like they were flying on the table. Where ever they arrived, the food would be reduced a lot. It was truly like the locusts destroying the fields.He was now like a hungry ghost who had been starving for thousands of years and suddenly had a chance to eat, so he ate like a beast.After the crown prince coughed, it turned silent in the hall, except the strident sound of Ye Xiao chewing\u2026The guys were all staring at him with undisguised anger in their eyes.Ye Xiao noticed it and acted like he was enlightened. He stopped chewing and spoke inarticulately, \u201cYou\u2026 Er. Are you finished? Oh I see\u2026 Then I am not going to restrain myself then\u2026\u201dAfter saying that, he just stood up to get the dish of meat furthest from him and spoke with satisfaction, \u201cThis dish is truly tasty, yet it is too far to reach. I was afraid that I wouldn\u2019t have a chance to eat it. Thanks for abdicating\u2026\u201dThe sound of chewing became more strident and annoying\u2026[Is it correct to use the word \u2018abdicating\u2019 like that?]The guys felt that they were receiving an \u2018ear-opening\u2019 lesson!The Crown Prince was embarrassed. He finally spoke, \u201cLord Ye, I need to speak.\u201dYe Xiao was stunned, but he still put a piece of meat into his mouth. Then he put down his chopsticks slowly and sat with a serious look. He said, \u201cSince the crown prince wants to speak, guys you should stop eating. You all lack discipline and are disgracing our crown prince, especially in front of a guest, me\u2026\u201dWhile speaking, he stretched his neck and swallowed.The guys wished they could take the plates and throw them at Ye Xiao\u2019s face fiercely![Who the hell is eating?!You are the only one who kept on eating, are you not?Now you actually talked like that to misrepresent the truth!The food in the General\u2019s House should be fine, right? How come they are letting you become such a starving beast?]The Crown Prince frowned slightly and was lost in thought. He naturally showed an angry look.The guys were all silent. They felt stressed as if a huge storm was crushing them. What they were fearing was the spirit of a man in a higher position. They couldn\u2019t help praising him in their minds, [He indeed is a Crown Prince. Full of the vigor of a ruler.]Ye Xiao was bored and rolled his eyes. He looked at the fried chicken in front of him. There was a chicken wing and a leg. [I love these kinds of food\u2026 The other wing and leg are in my stomach. Well you couldn\u2019t fly with only one wing, so I guess I need to eat them both\u2026Well one foot doesn\u2019t allow you to walk, so I should eat the other foot too\u2026]As for the \u2018vigor of a king\u2019, it meant nothing but fart to Ye Xiao!He had met so many powerful people in his previous life. Some of them could make everything freeze just by frowning and make mountains fall by humphing.Their so called \u2018vigor of a king\u2019, compared to those people\u2026 was less than a fart!Ye Xiao hadn\u2019t seen those people in a respectful way, so how could he possibly show respect to such an insignificant this-so-called \u2018vigor of a king\u2019?The Crown Prince\u2019s face was dark and he said, \u201cYou all know that things didn\u2019t go well in the Crown Prince\u2019s Palace. It has been unquiet recently\u2026 Many things that shouldn\u2019t have happened, happened recently\u2026\u201dWhen speaking of that, he sighed and stopped talking.Meng Zi-Xiao, who sat next to him went along with him and said, \u201cThat\u2019s true. The position of the Crown Prince was stable at the beginning. However, after all these recent troubles\u2026 our powerful support has been disturbed. And it has resulted in many troubles for us. I have no idea what the guilty person is planning\u2026\u201dWhen he started to speak, Guan Zheng-Wen was about to say something, but he stopped and just stared at Meng Zi-Xiao, caught off-guard.It should\u2019ve been Guan Zheng-Wen\u2019s turn to speak and lead the guys to force Ye Xiao into an embarrassing situation by slowly trapping him step by step. But why did Meng Zi-Xiao skip his turn and talk in advance?As he had started to talk, Guan Zheng-Wen would naturally stop. So he sat down with doubts.The Crown Prince was also surprised and he frowned.Another guy sneered, \u201cThe guy who has caused all of these events must be overjoyed.\u201dMeng Zi-Xiao spoke blandly, \u201cAll these things, since they have all happened, they are nothing but facts. There is always a reason for a phenomenon. There is always a cause and effect. There must be a source of all these\u2026 Lord Ye, what\u2019s your thought?\u201dThe guys were all talking at the beginning, so they didn\u2019t focus on Ye Xiao\u2019s face.After Meng Zi-Xiao spoke his words, the sharp eyes of these guys moved to his face.Ye Xiao was unaware of their stares. He just nodded and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. The force of the Crown Prince\u2019s Palace has been damaged lately. There must be a plot against us! Your highness, do you know who is messing with you? As long as you give me his name, I won\u2019t care about who he is, I will only go grab him and beat him up to death, so as to comfort you! You have treated me with utmost cordiality tonight. Accept my service as a return gift from me!\u201dThe guys were all stunned. They had lost their words.Some of them had been rather emotional and angry at the beginning, but they now held their emotions.[What?After we talked a lot, you are actually telling us you don\u2019t know who that is?What kind of shitty brain does this guy have?!]The Crown Prince frowned, but didn\u2019t speak.\u201cLord Ye, a wise man doesn\u2019t need to play foolish.\u201d Meng Zi-Xiao looked at Ye Xiao blandly, \u201cThat is not interesting. An upright man should never do any dirty deeds. With what you have done, you are disgracing the great General Ye.\u201d\u201cDisgrace?!\u201d A flash of coldness appeared in Ye Xiao\u2019s half-closed eyes, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cGeneral Ye has been a great hero for his whole life. People know that. However, you have to be aware that\u2026 a general is just a general after all. A general doesn\u2019t have the power to make a final decision in the Kingdom of Chen.\u201dWhat he meant was that the king was the most powerful person!Meng Zi-Xiao\u2019s eyes were sharp and his mouth contained a sinister sneer.What he had said was really offending, but reasonable.He obviously had put everything on the table to make Ye Xiao unable to escape the topic!The other guys couldn\u2019t help frowning.[We should talk about the Crown Prince, not the power of the king. You spoke those words to offend Ye Xiao and General Ye at the same time. It was rather reckless. Meng Zi-Xiao has been a calm and smart man in the past. How come he is acting like that today?]Meng Zi-Xiao was pushing Ye Xiao at the moment because there was bitterness hidden in his heart..Meng Zi-Xiao had passed five of the six tests in the past. In the last test, his argument was so evil that the king didn\u2019t like it. So he didn\u2019t win the first place and failed to be a legend, \u2018The Champion of Six\u2019.Although he was talented, he had a narrow mind and a cold heart. He didn\u2019t accept failure peacefully. After the final test, he spoke offencive words against the king. He indicated that the king was poorly-educated and as blind as a bat to let a stupid person succeed. It should have been a private talk among him and his friends, but it was reported to the king. The king was naturally furious.The king would not like to see him, so he made an announcement to expel Meng Zi-Xiao and forbade him from taking the tests again.Meng Zi-Xiao had no opportunity to work in the court, so he planned to join the army. He wanted to succeed in the military area and then enter the court.At that time, the northern army was famous in its achievements. So it was his first choice.When he went to Ye Nan-Tian to ask for a position, Ye Nan-Tian coldly rejected him, \u201cYou are just a dirty man with a mouth full of schemes who cannot achieve success in either the court or the army. You actually want to join my northern iron army. If I take you in, I would be allowing a pest among my brothers\u2026\u201dAnd then he never spoke to Meng Zi-Xiao again and expelled him.These two events had always been two of the biggest disgraces in Meng Zi-Xiao\u2019s heart! Long after that, he was finally introduced to the Crown Prince to be his aide.He should have been a talented man with an unprecedentedly bright future, yet now, he had became an aide. The difference between these two situations were huge.He surely didn\u2019t dare to speak anything bad about the king, so he decided to relieve his anger on Ye Nan-Tian.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2026\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014[1] An older ginger was spicier (\u59dc\u8fd8\u662f\u8001\u7684\u8fa3), means an older man is always more adept.This is the second regular chapter of the week.

    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 85 \u2013 The Unruly Smiling Lord [1]Meng Zi-Xiao thought that his life and his career as an official had been difficult because Ye Nan-Tian had been placing obstacles in his way to make him suffer.As of this moment, he thought that it was a good chance to take his revenge because it was the Crown Prince\u2019s Palace and Ye Xiao was here alone and helpless. That\u2019s why he took Guan Zheng-Wen\u2019s turn to speak in haste. And naturally, he brought up the past in his heart and seized the chance.And he had led the conversation to an irrevocable situation.He seized the chance to deal with Ye Xiao in order to suppress Ye Nan-Tian and let the crown prince have an extremely negative judgement on the house of Ye. Therefore, once the crown prince became king, he would get all the people of the Ye Clan killed\u2026 That would be the same as God realizing his wish\u2026Being challenged like that, Ye Xiao wouldn\u2019t be able to bear it. However, if he ran wild, he would be offending the crown prince. If he offended the crown prince, he would be disregarding the royal power. That meant that he would be committing treason!If so, it would be easy to put any criminal label on him!However, he was wrong about one thing. Ye Xiao wasn\u2019t disposing the royal power; in fact\u2026 he never saw the crown prince in his eyes! Besides, Meng Zi-Xiao didn\u2019t know how important Ye Nan-Tian was for the king.Ye Xiao naturally didn\u2019t know anything about the story, but he clearly felt that Meng Zi-Xiao had hostility against him since he had arrived. Now that he was messed in such a way, it would be an extremely strange thing if he could still bear it.Ye Xiao laughed and said, \u201cMeng Zi-Xiao, the nobody, right? It was not your role to say if I am playing a fool or not, and not your place to make any judgement about whether or not I am planning something! You don\u2019t have the right to say anything about the royal power. And it is absolutely not your right to judge the great general! Who do you think you are? Believe it or not. If you dare to say any words against my family again, I will throw your dead body to the streets of the capital. Hmm. Maybe not tomorrow. Maybe I am going to do it now!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know whether the great general is good or not, but I am sure about one thing. A man like you is worth less than a dog or a bird for the great general. \u2018A man worse than a beast\u2019 [2] is a description that perfectly fits you!\u201dYe Xiao smiled and stared at Meng Zi-Xiao peacefully. He spoke blandly, \u201cIf someone wants to question me, he should better send a qualified man to do it. Such a nobody, a garbage! How dare you question me? That is just ridiculous! A huge joke! A little garbage who never know how to respect seniority rules. No wonder the king decided never to recruit that somebody!\u201d\u201cThat is truly \u2018dog meat can never get on the table\u2019 [3]!\u201d Ye Xiao sneered, \u201cNo. It is insulting to dogs to call you a dog! You wouldn\u2019t think that if you are willing to be someone\u2019s dog, your master will surely give you bones, would you?\u201d\u201cAnd you threatened me\u2026 Even the crown prince didn\u2019t do so. You wouldn\u2019t think that you are better than him, would you? As the crown prince wants to talk to me, he has invited me for dinner\u2026 And you are nothing but a little garbage\u2026 What the hell! Just shut your mouth already and wave your tails!\u201dHe shouted and all the people kept quiet. The whole hall was in silence!Nobody would have thought that this Smiling Lord, who was one of the \u2018three foppish lords\u2019 actually shouted during the feast that was hosted by the crown prince. He was like a gangster, shooting without any restriction!He was shouting at the crown prince\u2019s man in front of the crown prince!Meng Zi-Xiao\u2019s face turned purple as he stared at Ye Xiao fiercely. At this moment, the anger and disgrace in his heart nearly made him want to kill himself!Ye Xiao\u2019s words, on top of being threatening, was also exposing his intent. And he added unmerciful sneering by saying that he was a dog that wasn\u2019t liked by his master, he was treated even worse than a dog\u2026Meng Zi-Xiao was furious inside and he nearly couldn\u2019t hold his anger. If he could, he would rip Ye Xiao into pieces so as to calm his anger. However, he only dared to think about it; he absolutely had no guts to do so.First of all, he was the son of a great general that he couldn\u2019t mess with. Secondly, it was the crown prince\u2019s home and the crown prince was holding a feast. Even though he felt extremely angry, he wouldn\u2019t dare to take any actions before the crown prince gives the order. Thirdly, Ye Xiao wasn\u2019t joking when he threatened him.It wouldn\u2019t be a difficult thing for the house of Ye to make Meng Zi-Xiao disappear. Even if somebody would find out, nobody would mess with the house of Ye for a dead man!Meng Zi-Xiao was not the brother-in-law to the crown prince after all.He was extremely furious, but he could do nothing about it. He could only stare at Ye Xiao fiercely while he spoke, \u201cI will keep your words in mind. There will be a chance in the future for you and for me to meet again. Let\u2019s wait and see then.\u201d\u201cLook at him\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao pointed him with a finger and laughed loudly, \u201cWhat a pussy. He was shouted like that, yet what he would do was nothing but remembering\u2026 What do you remember? Don\u2019t wait for the future. Meng Zi-Xiao, let me give you an advice today! I believe you will be thankful for what I will teach you today!\u201dMeng Zi-Xiao spoke fiercely, \u201cI wonder what good advice you would have for me. I ask for it sincerely. I am listening and will never forget it my whole life.\u201dYe Xiao casually picked up a chicken leg in front of him and threw it onto Meng Zi-Xiao\u2019s face. It immediately made his face turned oily. Ye Xiao spoke, \u201cThe advice is\u2026 since you chose to be a dog, you must act like a dog! When you are told to eat, you eat; when you are told not to, you can only watch even if the food was thrown to your face.\u201dHe sneered and spoke blandly, \u201cWhen you are told to bark, you bark twice; if you bark wrong, you will be ripped out and your skin will be my dish that goes with liquor! Understand? Now get the fxxk off!\u201dMeng Zi-Xiao was trembling. His face was pale, then it turned red, and then it became pale once again. Obviously, he was feeling extremely terrible.However, nobody would pity him at the moment.Because he asked for it.He thought that the son of Ye Nan-Tian was only a foppish fool so he wanted to humiliate him as a revenge. Yet he would have never thought that surprisingly, such a foppish fool had the capability to deal with him. And it was harsh!He who wanted to humiliate people got himself humiliated!It was completely silent!When they were preparing to question Ye Xiao, he burst in front of everyone in advance.And it was so violent, so unmerciful, so barbaric!The chicken leg dropped on the floor from Meng Zi-Xiao\u2019s face. \u2013 Pah! \u2013 Ye Xiao seemed to feel pity and sighed, \u201cWhat a good chicken leg. Such a waste throwing it to a dog. Fine. It was cheap anyway\u2026\u201dMeng Zi-Xiao shouted and rushed out covering his face.Silence took over the hall once again.The crown prince kept his face cold all the time before he finally opened his mouth, \u201cLord Ye Xiao, how sharp your words are; how fierce your methods are. However, what you did happened to be underestimating me, wasn\u2019t it?\u201dYe Xiao laughed and said, \u201cYou are being sensitive, your highness. I was just helping you for giving your dog a lesson. It was a small favor. No need to mention it. You are very welcome, your highness.\u201dThe crown prince spoke blandly, \u201cMeng Zi-Xiao is not a dog. He is my counselor! He is like my brother!\u201dWhen he said that, many of his men felt warm in their hearts.[He truly is a crown prince. He is so elegant and generous.With these words, he actually said, we won\u2019t be regretting doing anything for him.]Ye Xiao laughed, \u201cNot a dog? A brother? Oh I see! No offense. How was I supposed to know that such a garbage prick was actually your brother? Hmmm\u2026 It was \u2018like a brother\u2019\u2026 Well that\u2019s close enough! However\u2026 Your highness, when I shouted on him, why didn\u2019t you stop me? If you stopped me earlier, I would have considered your feelings. Even though I could never see that guy in my eyes, I would have shown him mercy! Hmm. You didn\u2019t say anything at all. Can I see it this way? You actually agree with me that he talked in a wrong way. And it pissed you, so you didn\u2019t stop me. Right?\u201dThe crown prince seemed angry and was speechless.\u201c\u2026 Moreover, when he ran out, why didn\u2019t you let him stay?\u201d Ye Xiao said blandly, \u201cBrother\u2026 Is that how you treat your brother?\u201dGuan Zheng-Wen spoke seriously, \u201cLord Ye!\u201d His voice was harsh!\u201cWait if you want to talk. I haven\u2019t finished yet.\u201d Ye Xiao spoke blandly, \u201cThe crown prince mentioned \u2018brother\u2019, and it made me want to laugh\u2026 The two guys who are fighting against you for the throne, are they not your brothers? The biological ones!\u201d\u201cYou fight against each other among your true brothers\u2026 Now that you told me Meng Zi-Xiao was your brother! Hey hey\u2026 How is this kind of brother compared to your biological brothers? I really have no idea about it!\u201dYe Xiao sneered.He had prepared to fall out with the crown prince, so naturally, he wouldn\u2019t care about talking wildly!What he said had totally destroyed the atmosphere. He talked even more boldly than Meng Zi-Xiao!It stunned everyone![This Ye Xiao is really unscrupulous!]The crown prince\u2019s face was really gloomy.Was the relation between them completely broken?!Guan Zheng-Wen trembled.What Ye Xiao had just said completely ripped off the fictitious mask of the crown prince. Without any reservation!The guys became silent for a while and then burst with accusations, \u201cWhat a bastard. How dare you talk like that!\u201d\u201cThe crown prince is kind and just. How could he possibly be like that!\u201d\u201cYou are slandering the crown prince!\u201d\u201cHow dare you, Ye Xiao! You are committing treason!\u201dFacing the accusations from everyone, Ye Xiao didn\u2019t say anything for retort. Guan Zheng-Wen was quiet too. The crown prince was also quiet, looking at Ye Xiao.Guan Zheng-Wen\u2019s eyes were scanning, understanding, and then finally confirming.The crown prince\u2019s eyes were cautious, careful, and\u2026 a bit utterly discomfited.Ye Xiao\u2019s eyes were like a deep pool in the autumn, which was silent and extremely profound.\u2026\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-[1] \u2018Xiao\u2019 (\u7b11) means smile.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu[2] \u2018worse than a beast\u2019 (\u79bd\u517d\u4e0d\u5982), means being a bad guy who has a terrible personality.[3] \u2018dong meat can never get on the table\u2019 (\u72d7\u8089\u4e0a\u4e0d\u4e86\u6b63\u5e2d), means a man is lame and never can be better.3rd regular chapter of the week!Translated by: RainEdited by: Alpha, ArchPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 86 \u2013 The Truth Is Meaningless\u201cLord Ye, I have underestimated you.\u201d The Crown Prince sighed.Unexpectedly, after Ye Xiao\u2019s speech, the Crown Prince didn\u2019t get angry. His first reaction was actually to sigh.\u201cMaybe because there has never been anyone who has thought highly of me. It was reasonable that you would never think highly of me.\u201d Ye Xiao spoke calmly.\u201cIt was my fault after all.\u201d The Crown Prince was a bit upset when he spoke.Yes, he was regretting.Now he could finally confirm that Ye Xiao\u2026 was never the foppish fool described in the rumors.He had been right. Ye Xiao wasn\u2019t stupid at all, instead, he was too smart!While his actions seemed to be a gangster\u2019s willful behavior, in fact, every move was made to approach his goal.Every move and every word was extremely sharp!Such an able person who was the son of the second most influential character in the military area, from the General\u2019s House, was now standing opposite the Crown Prince.Step by step, in the Crown Prince\u2019s Palace, he was finally turning hostile towards the Crown Prince himself!There was no other choice but to collide against each other until the winner and loser were determined.The Crown Prince just realized that since Ye Xiao had arrived, he had indicated his purpose by showing no respect to anyone and talking like a wild man. His attitude had shown that \u2018I am here to break it down to you\u2019!Earlier, it had been possible to turn the situation around. It had been more harmonious.If the Crown Prince could have given up his original plan, he could have mitigated the situation.Yet he hadn\u2019t realized it at all.Step by step, his men obliviously aimed at Ye Xiao, while at the same time, it made Ye Xiao point his sword at the Crown Prince.At this moment, there was no chance to turn the situation around!Guan Zheng-Wen sighed. He could understand the regret in the Crown Prince\u2019s heart!There was an extreme sense of loss.The Crown Prince had once told him a story of the time he had been drinking with his father, the King. the King was happy that day and said something meaningful, \u201cNan-Tian guarding the north can ensure me twenty years of peace!\u201dWho was Nan-Tian?Ye Nan-Tian!Who was Ye Nan-Tian? Ye Xiao\u2019s father!When the King said that, Ye Nan-Tian had been guarding the north for eight years and it was at peace the whole time.At that time, the Crown Prince didn\u2019t understand the true meaning behind his father\u2019s words.Yet now he knew.Before Ye Nan-Tian took the north, the north was constantly at conflict with its neighbour. It endured attacks from the Kingdom of Lan-Feng all the time and it had become rather difficult to defend the border. The whole kingdom was in an extremely fragile situation because of the northern affair\u2026Most of the kingdom\u2019s finance resources were used for the war in the north. They were in a terrible situation!When Ye Nan-Tian took charge of the north, he showed up like a huge mountain that no one could climb over.From then on, there had been no more suspense to the result of the war in the north!Those years, the northern affair which had suppressed the King had turned into something he was most proud of!Ye Nan-Tian could make that happen, but what about Ye Xiao?The only son of Ye Nan-Tian!Ye Nan-Tian was knightly, fair and straightforward with formal title and formal flag in his life. Even though he was a typical peerless hero, he could have been framed because of carelessness.Yet, to them, Ye Xiao seemed invulnerable!Invulnerable. It was a word which only existed in some compliments or lines of a novel, yet the Crown Prince had related it with Ye Xiao!Ye Xiao didn\u2019t have a heroic complex like his father.He could act shamelessly, cheekily, wretchedly or dirty. He could be tough, and he could\u2026All in all, he could use anything to create positive situations for himself!That was the Crown Prince\u2019s new assessment of Ye Xiao right now.Ye Xiao was an extremely dangerous man!The Crown Prince even had the feeling, [Father said that \u2018Nan-Tian guarding the north can ensure me twenty years peace\u2019. If I can recruit Ye Xiao, maybe\u2026 there will be no trouble in my future!What a pity. We have already turned against each other.The most piteous and annoying thing is that\u2026I realized the true value of Ye Xiao way after we started fighting against each other!Becoming an enemy of someone like him is never a wise thing to do. Yet such a stupid thing is exactly what I have just done!]He looked at Ye Xiao. His heart was completely shaken. Finally, he sighed.Guan Zheng-Wen also sighed.He was filled with regret.[Why couldn\u2019t I think about it earlier?If he really was just a foppish fool, how come he was so vigorous, walking with wild strides in the Crown Prince\u2019s Palace?The son of Ye Nan-Tian. The only son of Ye Nan-Tian. How is it possible for him to be a foppish black sheep!]\u201cYe Xiao, I hope that you can give me an explanation.\u201d The Crown Prince waved his hand and the others left the table.A few maids stepped forward and cleaned the table before leaving quickly.Right now, only Guan Zheng-Wen remained standing besides the Crown Prince.Ye Xiao frowned, \u201cExplanation? I wonder what sort of explanation you want me to give you.\u201dThe Crown Prince laughed. It was a peaceful laughter and he said, \u201cI need to know whether you are involved in the death of Mu Cheng-Bai or not.\u201dHis face showed that he was tired and a bit cheesed. He said softly, \u201cIn fact\u2026 You know, even if you are really a foppish lord, I may not be willing to give up on you\u2026 You are of great value\u2026 But sometimes, a man has to do something he should, even though he doesn\u2019t wish to.\u201dGuan Zheng-Wen showed a bitter smile on his face.\u201cEspecially\u2026 When there is a woman interfering\u2026 The reason that my woman is interfering is something related to her personal interests, so it becomes something I have to deal with\u2026\u201dThe Crown Prince sighed, \u201cAt the moment, if I don\u2019t take good care of this thing of hers, I will fail in attempting to do many things in the future\u2026 Especially when the woman is the one who sleeps with me all the time and has a powerful background that you couldn\u2019t afford to mess with.\u201dYe Xiao said commiseratively, \u201cI understand what you are saying. I truly do.\u201d\u201cSo I want to know the truth.\u201d The Crown Prince raised his head and looked at Ye Xiao, \u201cI need an explanation.\u201dYe Xiao laughed and said sharply, \u201cTruth? Does the truth really matter? When did you ever need any truth. You didn\u2019t know the truth earlier, yet you still took action. Even if you found out a proof of me having no relation with it, could you possibly let me free?\u201dThe Crown Prince stayed silent for a while.\u201cSo, the truth. It is nothing but trash that you guys can casually step on!\u201d Ye Xiao sneered, \u201cYour highness. If I tell you that I killed that guy, would you believe me? It\u2019s the same if I tell you that I didn\u2019t. Would you believe me?\u201d\u201cAll in all, whether I killed him or not, you won\u2019t let me go. Am I right?\u201d Ye Xiao sneered, \u201cSo. I don\u2019t understand what you are thinking. But I know one thing\u2026 I know what you want to do!\u201d\u201cOh? I wonder what is it that you assume we want to do?\u201d The Crown Prince\u2019s eyes were turning sharper.\u201cYou want a rightful, noble, flawless reason to get me killed, so that you can use the reason to lie to my father! A noble man can be cheated by rightful lies. In your minds, my father must be a noble man like that!\u201dYe Xiao went straight to the point, \u201cI am still alive, because\u2026 you hadn\u2019t found that reason yet.\u201dThe Crown Prince smiled bitterly.\u201cAs I am standing in the Crown Prince\u2019s Palace\u2026 I know that you have found the reason now.\u201d Ye Xiao\u2019s face was distant.\u201cYes. You are right. I found it. We got the reason to keep the general out of it.\u201d The Crown Prince nodded.\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao sneered, \u201cI have one question though. Why do you need a reason?\u201dThe Crown Prince frowned, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cYou took action against me before, many times!! Did you have a reason then? Any proof? No?\u201d Ye Xiao spoke tauntingly, \u201cYet you still came after me\u2026 Yet you need a reason to finally execute me. Isn\u2019t it ironic?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. You don\u2019t need the reason. If my father want to avenge me when I died, he will never be stopped by a bloody reason.\u201d Ye Xiao sneered and looked straight into the Crown Prince\u2019s eyes, \u201cI believe in one thing truly\u2026 If my father wants to avenge me\u2026 I\u2019m afraid that you, the Crown Prince, will never succeed in stopping him.\u201dAs a son of a feudal-time general, he had shown an extremely rebellious and regicidal attitude towards the Crown Prince.Yet he continued speaking, \u201cYou know! What I mean to say is that the reason doesn\u2019t really matter, don\u2019t you think?\u201dThe Crown Prince frowned and coldness flashed in his eyes.Of course he knew it.Ye Nan-Tian came to this kingdom to save his son. After that, taking charge as a general was also for the sake of his son, Ye Xiao!At that time, the King had sworn brotherhood to two men. Two princes with different family names. Others might not know about that, but the Crown Prince knew it for sure.Ye Nan-Tian had slaughtered thousands of millions of men to get the medicine from Su Ding-Guo in order to save his son\u2019s life.If his son died this day\u2026Ye Nan-Tian would never be restrained by anything. To kill a Crown Prince, it was not about whether he dared or not, it was only about whether he was willing to!It was very possible for him to get what he wanted!As long as he really wanted to!\u201cSo, what you are doing is actually useless and meaningless.\u201d Ye Xiao stared right into his eyes and spoke, \u201cYour highness, only the thing you did at the beginning was smart.\u201dThe Crown Prince frowned, \u201cThe thing I did at the beginning? You mean\u2026 Letting the Mu Clan to mess with you?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euYe Xiao didn\u2019t say anything but only smiled, yet his eyes were showing a colder expression.\u2026This is the fourth guaranteed chapter of the week.

    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 87 \u2013 I Don\u2019t Want To FightAlthough Ye Xiao remained expressionless, he was still sneering inside.When he talked about the thing that the Crown Prince had done at the beginning\u2026 he was actually talking about the dead \u2018Ye Xiao\u2019 getting poisoned.However, the Crown Prince seemed to be playing innocent or he had truly misunderstood Ye Xiao\u2019s words\u2026Anyway, Ye Xiao wasn\u2019t prepared to let it go.Only when he had avenged the dead \u2018Ye Xiao\u2019, could he finally satisfy the obsession in his mind.It wasn\u2019t just something which involved the dead \u2018Ye Xiao\u2019, but also something which he himself would have to take care of.\u201cMeaningless?\u201d The Crown Prince murmured. He suddenly smiled and spoke blandly, \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be meaningless. So\u2026 This time, I invited you to dinner because I wanted to discuss a solution with you to conclude this business between you and me.\u201dYe Xiao rolled his eyes and said, \u201cYou have invited me to dinner, which means that you must have planned to talk it through. However, there is no need for any discussion at all. I wonder what solution you have in mind now?\u201d\u201cIt is simple. A fight can settle everything once and for all.\u201d The Crown Prince rubbed the sides of his head and showed an expression of helplessness, \u201cBasically, I don\u2019t want to use this vulgar way to deal with this event. But you know, sometimes, the proper way isn\u2019t really enough to settle up some differences. A combat is not an elegant way, but it is the best way when it comes to the present situation.\u201dYe Xiao nodded and showed understanding, \u201cThat\u2019s true. The situation is obvious now. Unless you become king, considering my father\u2019s great exploits and power, there is no proper way for you to take care of me.\u201dThe Crown Prince\u2019s eyes were filled with coldness.The great general and his son were equivalent to a fish bone stuck in his throat. It troubled him so much that he had to destroy it.Ye Xiao said blandly, \u201cIn fact\u2026 in spite of what you think about the truth, at the beginning, if your brother-in-law hadn\u2019t come and messed with me, he wouldn\u2019t have died. He could have been spending his days luxuriously in the capital right now.\u201dAfter that, he stopped talking.The Crown Prince spoke blandly, \u201cLord Ye, there was another way in my mind. It should benefit both your side and mine. Yet we have now blocked all the routes towards that direction. There is only one way left to take.\u201dHe turned around, looked at Guan Zheng-Wen and said, \u201cYou have to fight against Old Master Guan. After the combat, no matter who wins, it will be the end of all troubles. In fact\u2026\u201dThe Crown Prince looked at Ye Xiao with sincerity and sighed, \u201cLord Ye, I don\u2019t want to mess with our General Ye\u2026 As long as I show my attitude to my woman, I believe\u2026 she and her men will not cause any more trouble. The dead are gone, they don\u2019t need to keep on making troubles, right?\u201dYe Xiao frowned and his eyes had already locked onto Guan Zheng-Wen who was standing besides the Crown Prince.Since the Crown Prince sent off everyone except Guan Zheng-Wen, he had started to pay attention to him. The old man seemed different. The possibility that he was a hidden superior cultivator was very high.As long as he was here, the Crown Prince would feel safe and fear nothing.According to Ye Xiao\u2019s research, this old man, Guan Zheng-Wen, was well-known in the Kingdom of Chen. On the surface, he was an elegant old man who reads a lot.Such an old man might be good at talking. His words might be sharp like a knife or a sword, but he seemed useless in combat.However, to fight against Ye Xiao, the Crown Prince had actually chosen this old man\u2026 The Crown Prince naturally wouldn\u2019t send his men to death, so this man must be a well-hidden superior cultivator, mustn\u2019t he?Right now, things were not following Ye Xiao\u2019s predictions.Suddenly, Ye Xiao felt the need to employ cautiousness.Because he\u2026 he had failed to notice anything unusual till now.With his great senses, he had actually failed to feel any sort of threat from this old man. There was only one explanation to that. The only possibility was that this old man\u2019s cultivation was way above Ye Xiao\u2019s.And he must be at a higher level than the Grade of Diyuan.He was at least at\u2026 the Grade of Tianyuan.In other words, Ye Xiao was now facing a superior cultivator of the Grade of Tianyuan. Besides, a man who could stand so close to the Crown Prince all times, a man whom the Crown Prince trusted to such an extent, must have some sort of special abilities.It was very likely that\u2026 this man was a superior cultivator at the Grandmaster Levels of Tianyuan.A cultivator at the Grandmaster Levels of Tianyuan would be among the most powerful men in the Land of Han-Yang.Ye Xiao couldn\u2019t help cursing in his mind.[This is really coming across a ghost after a long way in the dark. How come such an old bastard suddenly showed up?]Guan Zheng-Wen looked at Ye Xiao with a smile on his face, his expression tranquil. He spoke gently, \u201cThe Crown Prince is a generous man. He wants to settle our differences in a peaceful way by having a combat. I have to participate by having a fight against Lord Ye to lay the troubles to rest. Lord Ye, we should just go through the motions and finish the combat. You don\u2019t need to be cautious. I am old indeed, yet I could still fight for two rounds.\u201dHe coughed and continued, \u201cI hope that Lord Ye wouldn\u2019t say anything about having no capability in martial arts and words like that\u2026 Heh heh. As I have no troubles with my sight, I think your cultivation has reached at least level 9 in the Grade of Renyuan, right? You are only one step away from getting into the Grade of Diyuan\u2026 Regarding your young age, you are really a young man with an outstanding ability. A tiger wouldn\u2019t truly have a dog son [1] \u2026\u201dYe Xiao spoke blandly, \u201cYou are flattering me.\u201dYe Xiao had hidden his own cultivation capability intentionally. He had operated the Lunisolar Shadow to cover the martial aura of his cultivation. He didn\u2019t completely erase his martial aura, yet there were only a handful of people who were capable of discovering it. Guan Zheng-Wen had actually noticed it and found out that he had a good cultivation capability.Although he didn\u2019t find out everything about Ye Xiao and thought that Ye Xiao was only at the ninth level of the Grade of Renyuan, he was still the man who had the best insight amongst everyone Ye Xiao had met in his present life.The Crown Prince said that he just wanted to end their differences and didn\u2019t want to mess with General Ye. Ye Xiao didn\u2019t believe any of his words.[If you really want to make it so easy, why did you invite me to come over for dinner?If you stop making troubles for me, how could I mess with you?]When Guan Zheng-Wen said, \u2018go through the motions\u2019, Ye Xiao was disdainful of it.[If I believe that, I must be\u2026 really stupid if I get myself into the fire.Go through the motions, huh?]Ye Xiao was thinking, [Maybe it isn\u2019t completely a lie. They wouldn\u2019t dare to kill me in the Crown Prince\u2019s Palace after all. In fact, in order to settle everything, I have to get out of here alive and everything will reach a good end.That means they will make up a false story that they had never laid their hands on me.Yet they will absolutely not let me go so easily. All of these people are aiming at getting me killed.But this is an unresolvable contradiction for them\u2026The key to solve the contradiction is the words \u2018go through the motions\u2019.]\u201cOld Master Guan is right. It is the best situation that we all go through the motions and nobody gets hurt. Since the Crown Prince and Old Master Guan both wish for it, let me go along with your wishes.\u201d Ye Xiao played the role of an understanding person and said, \u201cBut you are an aged man. An old man who doesn\u2019t take pride in his ability to fight. How could I overwork you by fighting. Although my cultivation capability of martial arts is weak, by any chance, if you couldn\u2019t hold my attacks, how can I be sure that I won\u2019t get you hurt\u2026\u201dAfter Ye Xiao spoke, the Crown Prince and Old Master Guan were both stunned.[What?What did he say?He doesn\u2019t want to fight against an old man?Because he doesn\u2019t want to accidentally kill an old man?What? How could he be so shameless?]Old Master Guan was truly well educated. After being shocked, he immediately said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. The Crown Prince has given his word. To end the troubles in this way, I think it will be fine for me to hang on for a few rounds. Let\u2019s just go through the motions\u2026 Go through the motions\u2026\u201dYe Xiao laughed, \u201cNo, no, no. We can\u2019t have a combat. You are venerable in age. You surely wouldn\u2019t mind losing the combat. But I still need to live in the society. If we really have such a combat and people learned of it, the smart ones may understand that it was decided by the noble Crown Prince, but the others will think that I am bullying an old man\u2026 Anyway, it is absolutely wrong to have such a combat.\u201dThe Crown Prince and Old Master Guan were astonished once again. [What? He could actually swear that black is white [2]. How shameless could he be.]Old Master Guan spoke in a deep voice, \u201cLord Ye, it is you who said that it was decided by the Crown Prince. He has given his words. There is no way to change the decision. If I really couldn\u2019t bear the attacks of yours, so be it. I won\u2019t complain about it\u2026\u201dYe Xiao spoke with a smile, \u201cRelax. I surely have an alternative for this. It will neither violate the Crown Prince\u2019s decision, nor make us fight in the combat ourselves. You are so aged; how could I possibly hit you. I am always respectful to the elderly\u2026\u201dGuan Zheng-Wen was angry inside, yet he still had a smile on the surface. He said, \u201cI wonder what solution you have that could kill two birds with one stone. I am willing to listen.\u201dYe Xiao cheerfully spoke, \u201cIt is more than killing two birds with one stone. It actually kills three with one stone. It could even be more birds. My solution will make you satisfied for sure. It is really the most perfect solution\u201dGuan Zheng-Wen was nearly freaked out because of his shamelessness. He once again spoke in a deep voice, \u201cI am willing to listen.\u201dYe Xiao said, \u201cMy solution will satisfy you. You are well known in the kingdom. To fight in a combat will surely get you hurt. Let\u2019s finish the troubles through a verbal combat.\u201d\u201cA verbal combat?\u201d\u201cA verbal combat goes as follows, I will say one move and explain how I will proceed the move to attack you, and then you will say your move, and explain how you will defend. Or you explain your attack and I will explain how I will defend. The result will come out after all\u2026\u201dGuan Zheng-Wen and the Crown Prince were both furious.They were still underestimating how shameless Ye Xiao could be\u2026\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu[1] A tiger wouldn\u2019t have a dog son (\u864e\u7236\u65e0\u72ac\u5b50), means a son is as good as his father.[2] Swear the black is white (\u9ed1\u7684\u8bf4\u6210\u767d\u7684), means persist in saying something to deny the truth.5th gu of the week.Translated by: RainEdited by: Alpha, ArchPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 88 \u2013 The Battle Art Of A Thousand TroopsYe Xiao was serious, \u201cLet\u2019s do it this way and the only thing we need to do is talk. Isn\u2019t it much safer than going through the motions?\u201d\u201cIt will never hurt our relations. An old man shouldn\u2019t count on his weak strength. I believe you have been feeling weak since long ago. Let\u2019s just solve this thing by talking. I don\u2019t think there will be anyone saying I am taking advantage of you. After the verbal combat, there will be no more enmity between us. Isn\u2019t it a perfect solution\u2026\u201dGuan Zheng-Wen and the Crown Prince looked at this wretched guy and were left speechless.[You actually believe that we only want to go through the motions?Verbal combat?How on earth did you come up with such an idea?And after all, it actually turns out that we are the ones taking advantage of you!]\u201cHeh heh\u2026 You have a truly interesting mind. It is a practical way.\u201d Guan Zheng-Wen smiled and said, \u201cHowever, a verbal combat instead of striking seems to be something only women would do\u2026 Besides, I have admired your father\u2019s martial arts for years. I have always been wanting to learn something real from his official heir\u2026\u201d\u201cDo we really have to fight?\u201d Ye Xiao frowned.\u201cIt would be better to\u2026\u201d Guan Zheng-Wen had a reluctant look on his face. He actually gave Ye Xiao a hint with his eyes and spoke in a lower voice, \u201cBesides, it could also solve the enmity between you and the Mu Clan. The Crown Princess is already here to watch\u2026 No matter what, we need to make it happen for the Crown Prince\u2019s sake.\u201dYe Xiao glanced at the corner of the middle hall and found that the Crown Princess was standing nearby, staring at him.In her eyes, there was nothing but killing intent.[Why does this chick stare at me with such hatred in her eyes every time\u2026] Ye Xiao thought, [A Crown Princess, huh. Can\u2019t she just show some generosity\u2026 I have done nothing but kill her brother. I didn\u2019t break into her ancestral graves or kill her whole family. No big deal\u2026]Thinking of that, he curled his lips.\u201cSince you insist, then I will have a fight against you.\u201d Ye Xiao nodded and smiled, \u201cTake care. Don\u2019t wrench your arms or hurt your waist\u2026 Hmm. I mean, I am surely not a match to you, so you don\u2019t have to be too serious\u2026 Heh heh. Let\u2019s go through the motions.\u201dIt seemed Guan Zheng-Wen didn\u2019t understand Ye Xiao\u2019s \u2018warm suggestion\u2019 because he was pretty much focused on his own troubles. He only smiled peacefully and spoke gently, \u201cThank you for your kindness. We both know what we are doing.\u201dThe Crown Prince was calm.The Crown Princess\u2019s eyes were filled with delight.She thought she was finally going have her revenge and felt excited.\u201cPlease.\u201d Guan Zheng-Wen was still acting like a an old man who could barely walk steadily. He reached out his hand elegantly and walked out of the middle hall with Ye Xiao.In the yard, many people were waiting as they stood in a circle.Obviously, the Crown Prince had arranged for many people to watch the fight as eyewitnesses.Ye Xiao looked around and discovered many acquaintances.\u201cWhy is Xiao Xiao suddenly participating in a fight?\u201d A voice came over from the crowd, \u201cWere you not invited to dinner by the Crown Prince? Are you not here to discuss some national affairs? How come it has turned into a fight? That\u2026 You are really capable at creating trouble, are you not?\u201dIt was Zuo Wu-Ji who spoke.Ye Xiao looked over and found Lan Lang-Lang and Zuo Wu-Ji standing together. They were both stretching their necks to look at Ye Xiao. Even in the crowd, Lan Lang-Lang\u2019s favus-plagued head remained conspicuous.Lan Lang-Lang and Zuo Wu-Ji were actually part of the crowd too. They must have been invited by the Crown Prince. It was a reasonable thing to do.If they were not here and Ye Xiao died during the combat, there would be no one who could testify that the Crown Prince was innocent. A stranger\u2019s words would be, after all, unbelievable.In fact, the perfect witnesses were not these two foppish lords. The perfect choice would have been Prince Hua-Yang or Su Ye-Yue. But the Crown Prince would never dare to invite these two, because if any of them were here, a fight would never happen. They would definitely stop them from fighting. So the Crown Prince had no other choices other than inviting these two foppish lords to come.Lan Lang-Lang and Zuo Wu-Ji were worried for Ye Xiao, so they came without hesitation.When they saw Ye Xiao coming out, they knew it was true that he would be fighting. They were so worried, and they tried their best to give Ye Xiao some support with their eyes.Ye Xiao nodded and waved his hand to tell them not to worry.A group of guards from the Crown Prince\u2019s Palace came out and stood in a circle. They separated Ye Xiao and the crowd, creating a spacious fighting ring in the yard.Ye Xiao couldn\u2019t help frowning. His instincts were screaming at him, warning him of danger.It seemed like he had to abandon his title of a foppish lord from now on.However, he really didn\u2019t want to abandon this charade. He was just having fun in being the foppish Lord Ye\u2026How could he give up on that title so casually?But when he looked at his opponent, he couldn\u2019t help but laugh, \u201cHahahahaha\u2026\u201dIt turned out he was not the only one who felt unpleased about being watched.Guan Zheng-Wen was frowning deeply and he looked like he had eaten a piece of shit. He was obviously unhappy.Apparently, he felt the same as Ye Xiao. He realized that his true capability would be exposed to the public.And it was worse for him than for Ye Xiao.He had kept a low profile in his whole life and always showed up as an elegant scholar in front of the public. Everyone knew that he was only good at literature and was pretty weak at fighting\u2026Yet, as of now, he was forced to expose his cultivation capability\u2026All the hard work he put in disguising himself was going to be wasted. Besides, if Ye Xiao died after the fight, it wouldn\u2019t matter if it took days or months, he would still have died fighting.And Guan Zheng-Wen would be the guy who had caused his death.Would Ye Nan-Tian be reasonable if that happened? Even though he would consider not messing with the Crown Prince, he would definitely vent his anger on Guan Zheng-Wen.Then how could Guan Zheng-Wen defend against Ye Nan-Tian who had an army of experienced soldiers?[The Crown Prince arranged everything\u2026 He is using me as a scapegoat, isn\u2019t he\u2026]Thinking of that, Guan Zheng-Wen felt more uncomfortable.Yet he could have no regrets regarding the current situation.With all that had happened already, it was too late for him to step back.He had no choices left other than fighting.The story about Ye Nan-Tian singlehandedly fighting an army in the battle was a state secret. It was not known to anyone except a select few. If Guan Zheng-Wen knew the truth, he would be extremely upset.However, Ye Xiao\u2019s laughter had already made him feel worse. Guan Zheng-Wen sighed and said, \u201cOh. A hero is nothing but a product of his time\u2026\u201dYe Xiao realized that there was someone feeling worse than him. He had already achieved a sense of victory in his mind, so he felt delighted. He even spoke to himself with disdain, [What the hell. Since when did I become a man who takes pleasure in other\u2019s misfortune. I feel a little bit evil\u2026]Yet it was really hard for him to suppress his enjoyment after seeing someone having it worse than himself. So, although he was going to face a crisis, he looked happy.Because Ye Xiao appeared to be delighted, the crowd thought that he was confident. They looked down upon Ye Xiao and thought, [A young man winning a battle against a weak old man. Where is the glory in that?How shameless\u2026 You actually feel happy about it?]Wang Da-Nian and Meng Zi-Xiao were there too. They knew the true cultivation capability of Guan Zheng-Wen, so they smiled evilly. They happily looked at Ye Xiao, hoping that he would be slaughtered as soon as possible.Ye Xiao glanced at them. His eyes were full of disdain. He suddenly made a whistle.It was as if he was calling his dogs.The next moment, he pointed at Wang Da-Nian and Meng Zi-Xiao and bent the finger.The meaning was obvious. [You two are just like two dogs.]\u201cYou are a dead\u2026\u201d Their faces suddenly blushed and they were about to shout. They were obviously going to say something like \u2018you are a dead meat already\u2019, but before they could say it out, they noticed the Crown Prince\u2019s eyes coldly looking at them, daring them to speak.They trembled and stopped making any sound. Yet their eyes remained filled with hatred.\u201cPlease, Lord Ye.\u201d Guan Zheng-Wen looked upset, but it was too late for him to retreat now. After all, he had to do what he had to do.\u201cPlease, Old Master Guan.\u201d Ye Xiao stood opposite to him with a calm smile.The \u2018Old Master Guan\u2019 that Ye Xiao used to call him now embarrassed Guan Zheng-Wen, [We are going to fight against each other now. Why do you keep calling me Old Master? Are you addicted to it?]In front of everyone\u2019s eyes, he casually stood there. Ye Xiao attacked first.Ye Xiao suddenly rushed forward. He was moving fiercely with the sound of howling wind. His fists were like tigers, and his feet were like dragons. He rushed to Guan Zheng-Wen with a shocking vigor that could frighten ten thousand men.He only made one move, yet killing intent had already spread throughout the surroundings.\u201cDragon In The Battle! That is a move from the Battle Art Of A Thousand Troops.\u201dIn the crowd, there were a few smart ones who shouted out in low voices.It was popular move in the Kingdom of Chen. It was a fistic martial art that was usually used by the soldiers. It was bold and resolute, giving out a horrific aura. It killed decisively in an obvious way.As the son of a general, it was just fitting that he would use this martial art. He and this fistic martial art, under the present situation, were a perfect pair.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2026\u2026\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014First of the two sponsored chapters from last week.

    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 89 \u2013 Melting Bone PalmThe Battle Art Of A Thousand Troops was rather powerful when used against groups, but it was a bit inappropriate to use it in a one-on-one fight between cultivators. But Ye Xiao used it anyway.He didn\u2019t hesitate at all. It seemed like he was very adept at using it. So everyone arrived at the same conclusion, [He is proficient at using the Battle Art Of A Thousand Troops, but he doesn\u2019t know any other martial arts.]That was a reasonable assumption.For a man from the general\u2019s family, it was reasonable that he would use such a fistic martial art!\u201cGood move! How vigorous!\u201d Guan Zheng-Wen kept his hands on the back and turned his emaciated body around. His clothes floated and he casually dodged to a position right beside Ye Xiao. The move seemed slow, but it was actually fast and clear. His pale and thin finger reached out towards Ye Xiao slowly. It was like this finger had broken the limit of time and space. This finger pointed towards Ye Xiao\u2019s back.The dodge and the finger move had already aroused exclamations from the crowd!In the crowd, there were not only ordinary people like Lan Lang-Lang and Zuo Wu-Ji, but also some experienced and smart men. Although it was just the beginning of the fight between Ye Xiao and Guan Zheng-Wen, it had already become frantic.It took only an instant to make everybody\u2019s eyes wide opened, and a moment later, all their eye-balls dropped and bounced on the floor [1]. They were all extremely astonished\u2026[What\u2026 The famous Old Master Guan actually knows how to fight? And\u2026 He seems to be an absolute master.]This instant transposition was truly a fantastic move. He casually avoided the danger. Ordinary men would be able to use it. And that finger move looked ordinary, but it contained a massive amount of power.The old man was really good at hiding his capability.Ye Xiao noticed that finger was getting closer, yet he didn\u2019t turn around to defend against it. He suddenly jumped up and rolled his body, and then he made a turning kick. A blast of white whirlwind appeared and he had flew quite a distance forward. \u2013 Poof! \u2013It was another move in the Battle Art Of A Thousand Troops. It was \u2018Warding A Thousand Troops\u2019!Guan Zheng-Wen didn\u2019t hit Ye Xiao with that finger, yet he didn\u2019t change the move either. He leaned his body forward and rushed towards Ye Xiao, chasing him like a ghost. It was as if his slim body was sticking to Ye Xiao.At that moment, everybody realized that although Lord Ye was able to fight, he would never be a match for the Old Master Guan! He seemed to only know the basic moves of the Battle Arts Of A Thousand Troops. Yet Guan Zheng-Wen had already digested all the martial arts he knew into his fists, palms and fingers. His moves were fluent and free forming\u2026However, they didn\u2019t realize that\u2026When Guan Zheng-Wen got close to Ye Xiao with an outrageous speed, his two fleshless hands had casually tapped Ye Xiao eighteen times continuously\u2026Every tap was silent.Every tap was quick.Yet, it was like he had never moved his hands.Ye Xiao flew forward over three meters. And then he shouted and jumped over again in the air. With the sound of a wild wind, he instantly landed on the floor fiercely.\u201cBeast Leaping of the Battle Art Of A Thousand Troops! Well done!\u201dIn the crowd, Wang Da-Nian applauded. Zuo Wu-Ji and Lan Lang-Lang looked at him, shocked. It was understandable for everyone to applaud, except for Wang Da-Nian!Wang Da-Nian had enmity with Ye Xiao. He was the man on the Crown Prince\u2019s side. He had no reason to applaud Ye Xiao!Yet it was real that Wang Da-Nian applauded!That was irrational!That was against human nature!Guan Zheng-Wen waved his hands. Ye Xiao was suddenly stopped mid-stride, abruptly halting his rush to Guan Zheng-Wen before slipping and crashing against the floor. The next moment, Guan Zheng-Wen was shaking his head smilingly with his hands on his back, \u201cI am old. I truly am. My ability is not equal to my ambition now. I am useless\u2026 Lord Ye, you are young and strong. You are vigorous. Why don\u2019t we just let the combat end as it is now?\u201dEveryone knew that Ye Xiao had lost this fight. Guan Zheng-Wen had shown a decent demeanor.His casualness had perfectly shown his status as a senior. And he seemed to show mercy to Ye Xiao\u2026Nobody saw Lord Ye get hurt, right?Ye Xiao stood up and spoke angrily, \u201cEnd? What the hell are you talking about! I haven\u2019t lost yet! Let\u2019s fight again\u2026\u201dPeople in the crowd shook their heads. [A foppish lord never changes. He truly has no decency. The old man has shown you mercy. You have already crashed twice\u2026 Yet you still don\u2019t know how lame you are and you still want a tough fight?How shameless\u2026]\u201cYou are right. You haven\u2019t lost. Let\u2019s call it even. I am truly too old for this. Let\u2019s say you are concerned and respectful for an old man.\u201d Guan Zheng-Wen laughed.Ye Xiao humphed and said, \u201cSince you said so, I will show my kindness to an old man. Let\u2019s call it even then! You are really taking advantage of me then\u2026\u201dWith this declaration, the crowd bursted into catcall.Ye Xiao dusted his clothes and suddenly spoke, \u201cOld Master Guan, it really was not a good fight today. If there is a chance in the future, I will fight against you once again. I hope you can be in your best condition then. Heh heh!\u201dYe Xiao laughed and said to the Crown Prince, \u201cYour highness, I have enjoyed a good dinner. Now that the problem has been solved, I think it is time for me to get going.\u201dThe Crown Prince didn\u2019t expect that Ye Xiao would be so understanding. He had been thinking of a way to get him leave, yet Ye Xiao asked to leave himself. So he smiled and replied, \u201cTake care, Lord Ye. We shall get together sometime to discuss the national affairs.\u201dYe Xiao laughed, \u201cSure. When I have the chance, I will come back to enjoy good times with you once again\u2026 and your beautiful wife.\u201dThe Crown Prince\u2019s face twitched a bit. [You never forget to molest my wife\u2026] Yet he still smiled and said, \u201cYou are always welcome.\u201dThe Crown Princess was a bit angry before her eyes resumed sneering, [Come back again? You are going to die\u2026 And you actually tried to take advantage of me\u2026 Fine. I shall not be too critical of a man who is about to die.]Ye Xiao laughed and waved his hand. And then he squeezed out of the crowd with Zuo Wu-Ji and Lan Lang-Lang and left. After he left the crowd, a weird smile appeared on his face, but nobody had noticed it\u2026\u2026Guan Zheng-Wen coughed and then walked to the front hall. He was trembling.The crowd were led by the guards to leave one by one.The Crown Prince watched Ye Xiao leaving until his silhouette vanished. And then he smiled to everybody and got back to the front hall.In the front hall, three people remained.They were the Crown Prince, the Crown Princess and Guan Zheng-Wen.\u201cMaster Guan, how is it?\u201d The Crown Princess couldn\u2019t wait and asked.The Crown Prince also showed an inquiring expression.\u201cYour highness\u2026 Oh.\u201d Guan Zheng-Wen didn\u2019t answer the question. He sighed, \u201cYou have entrapped me so deep\u2026\u201dThe Crown Prince smiled, \u201cEverything is perfect. It is flawless. You don\u2019t need to worry. If someday you truly fall into trouble because of what happened today, I will protect you.\u201dGuan Zheng-Wen paused for a while and then sighed. He looked at the expecting eyes of the Crown Princess and spoke in a deep voice, \u201cThe Melting Bone Palm\u2026 I have managed to drop eighteen solid hits on Ye Xiao\u2026 He will be fine for the next few days. But.. after a month, his bones will slowly crumble and he will die when all his bones become broken.\u201dSpeaking of that, the wrinkles on his face seemed to become much deeper.\u201cThere won\u2019t be any doubts about it, right?\u201d The Crown Princess asked apprehensively.\u201cThis martial art has been my secret for many years\u2026 In those years, because it was too vicious, so\u2026 I decided to keep it a secret\u2026\u201d Guan Zheng-Wen sighed and said, \u201cEven I myself have no idea how to cure it. So, Ye Xiao is bound to die this time.\u201dThe Crown Princess puckered her face into a smile, \u201cYou have worked hard, Master Guan.\u201dGuan Zheng-Wen nodded and replied, \u201cMy pleasure, your highness.\u201dAfter that, he frowned and sighed deeply. In his eyes, there was a worry that became bigger and bigger\u2026He had surely finished the task of the Crown Prince, yet the enmity between him and Ye Nan-Tian had been clearly established.It was fine if Ye Nan-Tian didn\u2019t find out the truth. Otherwise, when Ye Nan-Tian came for him, he was afraid that his whole family would have no chance of\u2026 survival!Now he could only hope that Ye Nan-Tian wouldn\u2019t find out\u2026The promise from the Crown Prince, the old man knew that he really shouldn\u2019t count on it!\u201cYour highness, I have one question about Ye Nan-Tian\u2026 What is his history?\u201d He asked the Crown Prince in a low voice. The history about Ye Nan-Tian had been a secret in the Kingdom of Chen.Ye Nan-Tian had been a mysterious man since he showed up in the kingdom. And then he was suddenly famous and became the second most powerful man in the military. All the political and martial groups were interested in him, yet none of them got to know anything about his past.As the Crown Prince of the kingdom, he must know something, right?The Crown Prince responded with a \u2018hmm\u2019 and then stayed silent for a while. And then he said, \u201cI am not very well informed about it. It is said that Ye Nan-Tian was a hunter in the mountains\u2026 He coincidently came across something strange and ate some precious treasure, so he obtained a marvelous strength\u2026\u201dHe was merely talking shit.He knew nothing about Ye Nan-Tian. In fact, even the king didn\u2019t know much about Ye Nan-Tian. The Crown Prince only said that to comfort Guan Zheng-Wen.Guan Zheng-Wen felt relieved and said, \u201cThat\u2019s good. That\u2019s great.\u201d[He is only a hunter who coincidently obtained some marvelous strength\u2026That has nothing to fear then.If something happens to me, I could simply just kill him secretly. A living Ye Nan-Tian is the general of the Kingdom of Chen, the second powerful man in the military, but a dead Ye Nan-Tian is only a dead man!With the capability of the Grandmaster Levels of Tian-Yuan, it won\u2019t be hard to kill a general, right?]\u2026\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014[1] The author must be trying to say those people were extremely shocked.

He got home and acted like nothing had ever happened.Before they parted with each other, Ye Xiao took out a dan bead and gave it to Lan Lang-Lang, \u201cLang-Lang, take this dan bead. Melt it in warm water and divid the water into three portions. Every morning during sunrise, transfer one portion into a washbowl and use it to wash your head. After three days, your favus will be completely cured.\u201d\u201cReally?!\u201d Lan Lang-Lang opened his crossed eyes with a face filled with astonishment.\u201cThis is about your personal image which will last your whole life. Do you think I would joke about it?\u201d Ye Xiao frowned.\u201cHey, hey, hey\u2026 Damn! I am thankful even if it doesn\u2019t work\u2026 The favus truly hurts my handsome appearance. You are right. It is a big thing in my life\u2026\u201d Lan Lang-Lang snatched the dan bead in a hurried motion, \u201cI\u2019ll leave you two to talk further. I need to go home now\u2026 Hey, hey. I can\u2019t wait to wash my head tomorrow\u2026 Hahaha. I will no longer need to bear the favus\u2026 just three days\u2026\u201dHe scampered and left.Zuo Wu-Ji was disdainful, \u201cEven without the favus, he still has an obnoxious look, yet he actually finds himself to be handsome\u2026 Eww\u2026\u201d He waved his hand and spoke, \u201cIf we have nothing more to talk about, I should go home too. I was thinking about having a drink with you but Lan Lang-Lang\u2019s antics disgust me\u2026 Eww\u2026 I need to throw up\u2026\u201dAnd then he too left.Ye Xiao watch both of them leave and then his smile vanished. The extreme coldness deep in his eyes was finally let loose. His hands were in his sleeves and they were balled into tight fists.[The Crown Prince laid his murderous hands on me after all!How vicious!What a scheme!]Ye Xiao operated the East-rising Purple Qi in the darkness. Accompanied with the cool air of the night, he returned to the General\u2019s House.The steward was concerned as he looked at him. He spoke in a deep voice, \u201cHow was it? Did anything happen?\u201dYe Xiao hesitated for a while and said, \u201cNothing. Let\u2019s go inside.\u201dThe steward followed Ye Xiao to his room with an anxious look, \u201cHow was it? What do you mean nothing?\u201dYe Xiao grinned, \u201cNothing special. The Crown Prince let his man attack me with 18 strikes of the Melting Bone Palm. That\u2019s all.\u201d\u201cWhat? Melting Bone Palm? 18 times?!\u201dThe steward was astonished.The next moment, a mass of blue mist suddenly surged out from his body. It spread in all directions as if it was about to explode. \u2013 Boom! \u2013 The walls shook when this sinistre aura completely occupied Ye Xiao\u2019s room, resulting in multiple cracks!The mist destroyed the wall and it didn\u2019t even stop there. It kept on spreading.It was like an exploding bomb!The next moment, the steward turned around and rushed out. His face was twitching. He shouted in fury, \u201cMAR-THAR-FXX-KARRRRR! I will wipe out the Crown Prince\u2019s Palace tonight!\u201d\u201cWait, wait, wait\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao was shocked by the drastic reaction of the steward and hurriedly grabbed him, \u201cUncle Song\u2026 Calm down\u2026\u201d\u201cCALM DOWN? CALM DOWN MY ASS!\u201d Song Jue kept shouting while stomping on the floor, \u201cI have had enough in this fxxking Kingdom of Chen! FUXK THE HEAVEN, FUXK THE HELL! If it wasn\u2019t for the stupid promise made by Brother Ye, how could we possibly stay in this shitty place! FXXK! Now my brother has promised to guard their kingdom for twenty years, yet his only son has actually been struck 18 times of Melting Bone Palm! Fxxk Chen Xuan-Tian and everybody who shares his bloodline\u2026\u201dChen Xuan-Tian was the name of the king of the Kingdom of Chen\u2026Ye Xiao spoke in a hushed tone, \u201cUncle Song, lower your voice please\u2026 Calm down\u2026 Don\u2019t be emotional\u2026\u201d\u201cDON\u2019T BE EMOTIONAL?!\u201d Song Jue stomped his feet and his hair stood on its end, his eyes were bloodshot, \u201cI agreed to be a steward in this house, because I was trying to keep your little shitty ass safe. Now you are standing before me after being hit by 18 strikes of Melting Bone Palm! I, I, I\u2026 I am even worse than a stupid tortoise! I, I, I\u2026 I am going to slaughter every single man in that bastard\u2019s house. I am going to hang everyone in his clan! Otherwise, people will think that I am a weak douchebag!\u201dYe Xiao twitched his mouth.[He is way, way, way too emotional!Hang everyone in one\u2019s clan\u2026 That certainly sounds like something a king would declare using a royal decree\u2026 Now he actually wants to hang everyone in the king\u2019s clan\u2026 That really is something incredible\u2026]\u201cUncle Song, chill out please. Listen to me. Would you listen to me first?!\u201d Ye Xiao forcefully dragged Song Jue and made him sit within the dilapidated room.In fact, it was far worse than a dilapidated room; it was completely in ruins.Due to all this commotion, the blood guards had heard them and all of them rushed over. One meek voice was heard from outside the door, \u201cIs everything ok, Chief? Is something happening to the young master?\u201dBefore Song Jue could answer, Ye Xiao hurriedly spoke, \u201cNo. It\u2019s fine. I am all right. Go to bed, all of you. I need to have a private conversation with uncle Song. Heh heh heh heh\u2026\u201dThe walls of his room had fallen, yet he said that everything was fine\u2026The blood guards were hesitant and unwilling to leave.Ye Xiao dragged Song Jue and walked out the door to pacify them in person, and then they went to Song Jue\u2019s room.They had just left Ye Xiao\u2019s room and then, \u2013 BOOM -, the whole room collapsed upon itself\u2026The blast nearly knocked down Ye Xiao. He hastened his steps.Song Jue looked back and his face was still expressionless.It suddenly reminded Ye Xiao of a doggerel and he nearly started to laugh out loud.He then murmured, \u201cThe first time Uncle Song looks back, his ugly face breaks down a building in his sight; the second time Uncle Song looks back, his ugly face cracks the mountain and makes the river reverse its flow; the third time Uncle Song looks back, his ugly face brings forth darkness that causes even ghosts to feel petrified; the fourth time\u2026\u201d(\u5b8b\u5927\u7237\u4e00\u56de\u5934\uff0c\u5413\u5012\u8eab\u540e\u4e00\u5ea7\u697c\uff1b\u5b8b\u5927\u7237\u4e8c\u56de\u5934\uff0c\u5c71\u5d29\u5730\u88c2\u6c34\u5012\u6d41\uff1b\u5b8b\u5927\u7237\u4e09\u56de\u5934\uff0c\u65e5\u6708\u65e0\u5149\u9b3c\u795e\u6101\uff1b\u5b8b\u5927\u7237\u56db\u56de\u5934\u2026\u2026)Song Jue said angrily, \u201cStop. Three times is enough. Those are good lines. When I return to\u2026 Hmm. I will use it as my chant\u2026 Hmm\u2026 Wait, no! It is not a good time for that. I have to send a message to your father right now and tell him to come back quickly. Only when he comes back, will there be a chance to cure the wounds inflicted by the Melting Bone Palm. I hope there is still time. There must be!\u201dYe Xiao twitched his mouth a little bit. He had found Uncle Song to be cute; now he confirmed that he was indeed very cute.He realized that his father\u2019s capability was really strong. A man who could cure the wound caused by Melting Bone Palm must have a cultivation capability that was at least better than Guan Zheng-Wen.When they entered Song Jue\u2019s room, Ye Xiao told him the truth at once, \u201cListen, Uncle Song. My father doesn\u2019t need to know. The Melting Bone Palm doesn\u2019t work on me. Not at all!\u201dSong Jue frowned and spoke in a worried tone, \u201cXiao-Er, it is not something to be joking about. Do you even know what Melting Bone Palm is? It is an extreme nasty martial art\u2026 It uses the complete yin power to hurt people. Who ever has been hit by it, unless he knows that he has been hit, he has no way of realizing that he is affected. By the time he gets to know of it, 70 percent of his bones must have already melted away. By then, there is no way for him to get cured. If you don\u2019t get the wound cured as soon as possible, I am afraid something really bad is going to happen to you\u2026 What people always say about people becoming a heap of minced meat\u2026 That is a saying created by the Melting Bone Palm.\u201d\u201cI know. I really do.\u201d Ye Xiao spoke calmly, \u201cUncle Song, to be honest, today, at the Crown Prince\u2019s Palace, I thought about killing him or just refuse negotiating with him and running away. They wouldn\u2019t dare to hurt me forcibly\u2026 But I gave up both thoughts.\u201d\u201cOur strength in the capital is limited. We can\u2019t be reckless, really.\u201d Ye Xiao paced slowly to the window, \u201cSo, even if I can\u2019t bear it any more and want to make some trouble, I will need to do it discretely. Since we are facing the royal power, even if we are very proud of our clan, we won\u2019t have a good chance to win.\u201d\u201cThere are so many men in our house. They could have died because of my reckless actions!\u201d Ye Xiao smiled blandly, \u201cI can\u2019t risk all of your lives just for venting my anger.\u201d\u201cSo I could only think of something else.\u201dSong Jue was expressionless and silent. His lips were trembling. Obviously, he was still extremely emotional, but he was trying his hardest to calm down.\u201cSo, when I found out about their plan, I knew that they were really on to me this time, but they were fearful. So they tried to use something \u2018imperceptible\u2019 to take my life. There were only a few ways to do so.\u201d Ye Xiao raised six of his fingers, \u201cThey are Melting Bone Palm, Soft Cloud Fist, Yin Wind Martial Art, Qiong-Hua Ice Mist, Shade Finger Point and\u2026 Fatality Martial Art.\u201d\u201cIn the whole world, there are only these martial arts that can take my life and remain unnoticeable, soundlessly and slow\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao smiled.Song Jue was astonished and didn\u2019t find any words to say.Because only four of those six martial arts were known to him.Song Jue believed that in the Land of Han-Yang, even in the world above it, there were only a handful of people that knew more than he did!Yet Ye Xiao was actually very familiar with them and just listed these six martial arts loud and clear.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHmm. Qiong-Hua Ice Mist and Fatality Martial Art, what are they?\u201d Song Jue frowned, \u201cYou have been staying in the house all the time. Even if you did save an old man and he taught you something, he couldn\u2019t have taught you more than just a few moves. How do you know so much about martial arts? You actually know some secret martial arts that even I don\u2019t know!\u201d\u20261st guaranteed chapter of the week.Translated by: RainEdited by: Arch, AlphaPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Curing The Melting Bone Palm!\u201cUrn\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao realized that he had divulged too much information, \u201cWell\u2026 You wouldn\u2019t know. In fact, I\u2019ve read a lot of books. Reading makes a man well informed. My knowledge\u2026\u201dYe Xiao fabricated some baloney and said, \u201cThe martial art that I am cultivating can cure the wounds caused by any of these six martial arts, so I decided to absorb the attacks. The strength of our house has almost been completely exposed. That is not a good thing, so I think we should intentionally hide some of our strength. This time, they laid their dirty hands on me\u2026 It now gives us a good reason and a good opportunity to return the favour.\u201dSong Jue said, \u201cI understand that. But the most important thing is your safety. Melting Bone Palm, as I know, is not easily dealt with. I am unable to deal with it anyway. We should still get your father to make sure that you are safe.\u201dYe Xiao stopped talking. He slowly took off his upper garments and revealed the smooth white skin of his chest. He turned around and showed his back to Song Jue. His back was fair and no abnormalities were visible.And then he started operating the East-rising Purple Qi, causing a stream of hot qi to slowly rise from his body.Song Jue stared at Ye Xiao while watching out for signs of any wounds and abnormalities.After the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, some faint palm marks showed up on Ye Xiao\u2019s back one by one.These marks were appearing from underneath his skin. One after another, these palm marks materialized on his back, covering it entirely. They were packed extremely tightly and a few even overlapped\u2026As Ye Xiao kept on operating the East-rising Purple Qi, the initially faint palm marks became more prominent as they started to turn into a darker shade. At the beginning, these marks were light cyan in colour, and as time passed, they became dark cyan. They looked gruesome.\u201cThere are 18 cyan coloured palm marks. It really is the vicious Melting Bone Palm.\u201d Song Jue took a deep breath and his face filled with coldness.But not long after, the coldness on his face disappeared.He was an expert in cultivation. Since Ye Xiao had known that he was secretly hit and could make the hidden wound show up on the surface, that meant he truly had the capability to negate the effects of the Melting Bone Palm.It was now absolutely certain.Song Jue had never heard of a man in his early stages of cultivation actually forcing the hidden wounds caused by the Melting Bone Palm to appear on the surface of his body.The martial art that Ye Xiao used seemed to be unbelievably magical to Song Jue.If Song Jue had never been hit by the Golden Mai Palm and he was at his peak condition, it would be an easy job for him to cure the damage caused by the Melting Bone Palm. However, he was suffering from hidden injuries and that made him fall to the very bottom of the cultivation stages. He was no longer able to cure the wounds caused by the Melting Bone Palm.Yet, he was sure that even if he was at his peak condition, it wouldn\u2019t be as easy for him to deal with the Melting Bone Palm like Ye Xiao was able to.It would at least take him one month of effort to totally force the hidden marks to show up.\u201cThat was truly vicious!\u201d Staring at the 18 cyan wounds, Song Jue grinded his teeth.Ye Xiao\u2019s face was all red at the moment. He was required to operate the martial art in full flow to force the hidden wounds to show up. With his current capability, it had taken his whole strength to do so.While he kept on operating the martial art, he could feel the Melting Bone Palm\u2019s extraordinary viciousness and cruelty.With the marvelous East-rising Purple Qi, he had already compelled most of the wounds to arise, yet there was still a part of the wounds which remained deep within his bones.Luckily, Ye Xiao was quite experienced, and the East-rising Purple Qi was truly fantastic, otherwise, he would have probably missed these hidden wounds. They were almost impossible to be find.[To resolve these wounds that have seeped into my bones, I need to use the gelid qi to assimilate them slowly when I am alone.] Ye Xiao immediately devised a plan in his mind. He sped up the operation of the East-rising Purple Qi to resolve the surface wounds.After a short while, ninety-nine cycles of Qi circulation had passed.Song Jue was shocked and he looked at the white mist that kept rising from Ye Xiao\u2019s body. It only took a while and the dark cyan marks slowly started changing. They had turned light cyan\u2026\u2013 Puff! \u2013 Ye Xiao opened his mouth and spat out some cyan-purple blood.When the mist disappeared, the marks on his back had almost completely faded away.Ye Xiao gradually stopped operating the martial art. The light marks disappeared at the same time. They returned into the skin.Although the wounds were still inside him, they were almost harmless now. At least, they wouldn\u2019t take his life.In fact, the damage that was caused by the Melting Bone Palm was similar to that of the Golden Mai Palm. They both created some impacts and forced themselves into people\u2019s body. They hid inside the body, and when they finally acted, they would immediately cause death.To deal with it, a power of the same attribute as the wound was required to assimilate it. However, these two martial arts were of quite different levels regarding to their capability. If the Golden Mai Palm was a rank 1 martial art, then the Melting Bone Palm was, at best, worthy of rank 2. It could be ranked worse.Ye Xiao was able to cure the effects of the Golden Mai Palm in Song Jue yet strangely, he could not cure the wounds on his own self. In fact, to cure Song Jue, he had to send his energy out of his own body. Whereas now, he was self-saving. There was a big difference between these two scenarios.Regarding the current situation, it should take Ye Xiao only a few days to fully cure the rest of his injuries. But to fully cure the wounds inside Song Jue, it had required Ye Xiao to be much stronger. That showed the difference between Golden Mai Palm and Melting Bone Palm.\u201cUncle Song, now you can relax, right?\u201d Ye Xiao smiled tiredly.Ye Xiao was all sweaty. He had nearly used up all his spiritual power after that.\u201cYes.\u201d Song Jue was finally relieved. His face turned from dark and angry to happy and cheerful. He said with his eyes half-closed, \u201cGood for you, kid. You made me worry. It turns out you have played a trick on those bastards. Amazing.\u201dYe Xiao watched Song Jue\u2019s face. His expression had changed so fast that Ye Xiao suspected his uncle of being temperamental. He said, \u201cThe Crown Prince has been heartless to me, so I shall treat him the same way. There will be a time for me to make the scores even. Our family is spread apart at the moment. The part in the capital is weak, so we can only slow down the rhythm for now.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d The steward spoke in high spirits, \u201cNow the challenge has become an opportunity. Now that you are \u2018badly injured\u2019, we can fall back from the open into the dark and get out off their sight\u2026\u201d\u201cExactly.\u201d Ye Xiao clapped.\u201cWhen they no longer focus on us, we can make covert actions to take care of those motherfxcking sons of bitches\u2026\u201d The steward was getting excited while he talked. More and more rude words came out from his mouth.[Motherfxcking sons of bitches?]Ye Xiao thought, [Some motherfxckers\u2026 who were sons of bitches\u2026 That is a real tragedy.]\u201cDirty tricks eh? Humph.\u201d Song Jue\u2019s eyes were shining and he spoke viciously, \u201cI have a huge amount of tricks in my arsenal. Maybe I should send some guys to rape the Crown Princess. What do you say? Take some small advantages.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao looked at his uncle and immediately became sweaty.[To do that to someone is just a small piece of advantage to you?]Song Jue seemed to realize his rude language was inappropriate. He coughed and said, \u201cI mean urn\u2026 I should send some guys to make some trouble in the Crown Prince\u2019s Palace to distract their attention.\u201dYe Xiao spoke gently, \u201cAs for now\u2026 We should stay still and keep low. We should at least wait for a half month. First, our men need to prepare and we need them to be stronger. Second\u2026 we need to wait for the moment when they\u2019ll think that the wounds within me are about to take my life\u2026\u201d\u201cTrue.\u201d Song Jue nodded, \u201cWhy did I forget this? First there needs to be a danger, and then it could transform into an opportunity\u2026\u201dAnd then he spoke mysteriously, \u201cBy the way, I have a good news for you. I nearly forgot it.\u201dYe Xiao was surprised, \u201cWhat news?\u201d\u201cYou uncle, that means me, has improved a lot in cultivation\u2026\u201d Song Jue was proud, \u201cNow I am in the first level of the Grade of Tianyuan.\u201d\u201cCongratulations, Uncle Song! You finally become a superior cultivator of the Grade of Tianyuan.\u201d Ye Xiao was happy.Song Jue laughed, he was overjoyed.And then he suddenly stopped.He spat immediately and thought, [What the hell am I happy for? I was a superior master that had broken through the Grade of Tianyuan a long time ago\u2026 Now I have just recovered a part of my strength to reach the first level, yet I actually felt enjoyment because of that. That\u2026 was so embarrassing\u2026]He relaxed for the rest of the night. He could finally have a good rest. But Ye Xiao had been busy all night to deal with rest of the wounds. They were much more difficult to cure, because they were dispersive. They were hard to aim at and force out. The extremely cold energy that was hidden deep inside his bones were the most difficult ones. Ye Xiao had tried everything, he kept operating the gelid qi to finally force them out of his body. He was exhausted and sweaty, and right now, he felt that he was made entirely of sweat\u2026The whole night, he had done nothing but deal with the wounds.His bedroom was destroyed by a certain uncle of his, so he had to temporarily live in the guest room.\u201cI was underestimating the damage dealt by the Melting Bone Palm. It\u2019s really vicious.\u201d Ye Xiao looked at the cold yin qi in his hand. Even his gelid qi couldn\u2019t assimilate this cold yin qi. It was surely useless.It was not only useless, but also so hazardous that wherever it appeared, nothing would survive.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euYe Xiao thought about it and stomped on the floor. A deep pit was instantly created. He threw the dark yin-cold qi inside the pit and then used his gelid qi to freeze the floor solid. He didn\u2019t want the cold yin qi to get out and to create disasters.\u2014\u2014\u2014This is the second guaranteed chapter of the week.Translated by: RainEdited by: Alpha, ArchPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was really exhausted. He finally had some time to have a good night\u2019s rest.If he was still the previous Xiao Monarch, who was always alone and aloof, how could he possibly deal with the Crown Prince so courteously without any sincerity? He wouldn\u2019t have been full of worries and let the things develop further. With his temper, he would have likely struck out the needles and killed the Crown Prince and his wife once and for all.Even if he needed to escape and hide from the royal court\u2019s pursuit without definite residence, and even if he was facing enemies from all over the world, he would still do that. There would be no compromise.However, he was different now and he clearly knew it.Now he had something to worry about.His father, his family, the steward, the blood guards, Su Ye-Yue, Prince Hua-Yang, Lan Lang-Lang, Zuo Wu-Ji\u2026These were the people he was concerned about, and also the people that made him restrain himself.For the sake of these people, Ye Xiao had to be more meticulous in choosing a way to solve the problem in front of him.He had been unwilling to part with any of these people.If any of them died because of him\u2026It would be something he would never be able to bear, and it would definitely be something he would regret for life\u2026\u201cIs that what they call family affection?\u201d Ye Xiao was lying in bed with his eyes half-closed. There was a stream of warmth that rose and ran slowly in his heart. He felt very comfortable.These people would sacrifice anything for him, even their lives.That was what they call an affection.An affection that he had never experienced before!Since they were willing to sacrifice for him, then it became his responsibility to protect them.That was the responsibility of a man.It was something he, as a man, had to bear!It was such a dark night. He sighed involuntarily.He had already accepted his new identity. He had also accepted his family. Most ridiculously\u2026 since he was reborn, he had never even truly seen his present father, yet he had completely accepted his present identity and family.He felt that everything was so ridiculous.\u201cMaybe it is a farewell to my lonely days in the past\u2026\u201d He murmured to himself, \u201cMaybe I have been too tired of those\u2026 lonely days that were full of uncertainty\u2026 for a long time\u2026\u201d\u201cFamily affection\u2026 It feels fantastic\u2026 I have been through so many lonely days in my previous life\u2026 I have been through so many joys and sorrows, too many bloody battles and madness\u2026 Who has ever given me any kind of family affection?\u201dThinking of that, he took a deep sigh and murmured, \u201cWhy was I an orphan\u2026 in my previous life? I asked myself a million times why my parents abandoned me. Why did they?\u201dHe felt sad and stopped thinking.He closed his eyes to force himself to sleep.He fell asleep with an infrequent dream\u2026In the dream, there was a woman gently looking at him standing in the mist. She kept calling, \u201c\u2026 Xiao-Er\u2026\u201dYe Xiao was asleep. He didn\u2019t know that a drop of tear from his eyes dripped into his pillow.It was glittering and translucent like a dewdrop.It stayed on the pillow for a while, and then it seeped into the pillow. Only a tiny wet mark that showed the transitory existence of the teardrop was left, and it also disappeared right away.If he was awake, he would rather die than let it come out. However, in this dream, he chose to set himself free. He was venting the hidden emotions inside his heart.That fond face in the mist staring at him with a pair of eyes that were filled with love\u2026 Then he felt a soft hand touching his face gently\u2026His mouth showed a smile of happiness. Such smile would have never shown up on the Xiao Monarch\u2019s face. Such smile had never belonged to Ye Xiao!It was tranquil\u2026 in the dream.\u2026In the middle of the night, Ye Xiao was immersed in the sweet dream and didn\u2019t want to wake up. However, a clap of thunder suddenly awoke him from his sleep!\u2013 BOOM! \u2013It sounded like it had splitted the dark sky, and it had awaken many people in the capital!The next moment, the dark clouds gathered together from different directions\u2026Some of them were even colorful!When Ye Xiao saw that, he was astonished. He stood up and discovered that it was raining heavily outside.He watched the heavy downpour and felt that something was wrong.However, he had just woken up and he was still a bit dazed. He couldn\u2019t find out what was wrong.He didn\u2019t see the scene when the clap of thunder emerged from the sky with his own eyes.If he was able to see it\u2026 He would have naturally figured out what was going on.Yet he had been in sleep because he was too tired\u2026And it was a tight and good sleep.The roaring thunders continued to struck the land. But only ordinary thunders were left. \u2013 Boom. \u2013 \u2013 Boom\u2026 \u2013The rain was getting heavier.Ye Xiao watched for a while and didn\u2019t find anything suspicious. He was preparing to sleep again to continue the god-given sweet dream. Suddenly, he felt another powerful thunder splitting the sky fiercely!The next moment, a lightning flashed in the sky.And then it instantly disappeared.A normal person or even a superior cultivator in this world would think that it was nothing but a normal thunder.Yet the hair on the back of Ye Xiao\u2019s neck stood up with fear right away.That was not a lightning! It was the movement of two superior cultivators!One of them was escaping, while the other was chasing!They were moving in an extremely high speed!The spiritual qi that was covering their bodies rubbed the air while they were moving, and that created the flashing lights. Combining the extreme speed and the flashing lights, it looked exactly like a thunder!In Ye Xiao\u2019s estimation, these two were at least in the Grandmaster Levels of Tianyuan. Both of them were absolutely stronger than Guan Zheng-Wen!He had thought that with the capability of the Grade of Diyuan, he was able to knock down everyone he encountered. However, just a while ago, he had fought against Guan Zheng-Wen, and now, he saw these two superior cultivators. Not to mention even Steward Song had returned to the Grade of Tianyuan too.Ye Xiao thought for some time while looking at the direction of those flashing lights. His eyes lit up and then his right hand reached to the bed. A suit of black clothes flew up. \u2013 Hewh \u2013The next moment, he was dressed in black. \u2013 Puff. \u2013 He flew out through the window and suddenly, the rain got him all wet.He didn\u2019t care much about the rain. He twitched his body and immediately arrived at the roof. In the next instant, he instantly disappeared.\u2026That was not the Lunisolar Shadow he was using; it was the One Laughter in Skyline!The Lunisolar Shadow kept him concealed while moving in high speed, while One Laughter in Skyline purely increased his speed to the fullest. Because its sole focus was his movement speed, it made his speed instantly reach its peak!He who was just drinking at the door, suddenly appeared in the skyline with just a laugh!(\u65b9\u5728\u95e8\u524d\u996e\uff0c\u4e00\u7b11\u5df2\u5929\u6daf\uff01)Someone was just drinking at the door of a tavern in the market, but after a single laugh, he was already at the end of the world!One Laughter in Skyline.It was publicly accepted as the fastest martial art in the Qing-Yun Realm!The only one!In his previous life, because of this martial art, he had been able to escape from all those people chasing him for over 30 thousand miles!Within an instant, he had moved 300 kilometers already. The rain didn\u2019t disrupt him. In fact, it actually boosted him!He was like a wind blowing to the ends of the sky.The tiles of the roofs of the houses he passed by were like fish scales under his feet. \u2013 Shoot shoot shoot. \u2013 They flashed away. Soon, he had arrived at the edge of the capital. The city wall was over 20 meters high. Before the guards on the wall noticed anything, Ye Xiao had already disappeared. \u2013 Puff. \u2013 He instantly arrived outside the wall.Far away, yet another two lightning flashed in the sky, they were like two silver snakes dancing.Ye Xiao had sharp eyes. He noticed there were sword lights flashing in the sky. He was distant from it, so he couldn\u2019t see it clearly, but he knew that these flashing lights were indeed sword lights.Ye Xiao was like a rolling Chinese dragon who rushed forward as he instantly entered the forest. He then operated the Lunisolar Shadow\u2026The One Laughter in Skyline gave him the fastest speed, but it couldn\u2019t conceal his whereabouts. It was the only negative result of pure speed. As for the Lunisolar Shadow, it covered both speed and concealment. It was slower than One Laughter in Skyline, but it kept him safe while moving.[Why did these two superior cultivators chose to fight at night, not to mention the heavy downpour?]As of this moment, he was getting closer and closer!\u2013 Dang! \u2013 The weapons of the two superior cultivators struck each other. Looking at them from a distance, Ye Xiao could see some flashing lights blasting to the sky. It was quite a marvelous sight.In the heavy downpour, the status of the battle constantly reached his senses. From what he heard, some trees had obviously fallen down\u2026Ye Xiao frowned and watched. The battle was about four miles away from him.He waited. He didn\u2019t approach, and as he expected, after a while, another lightning appeared. It came from the other direction this time. They were nearly a thousand kilometers away from where they had been.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThey are both top superior cultivators as I expected.\u201d Ye Xiao was motivated in mind as he operated the Lunisolar Shadow in order to get closer to the battle.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u20143rd guaranteed chapter of the week.Translated by: RainEdited by: ArchPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Obviously, one of them has been tired, so they have to start fighting here. Otherwise, with their cultivation capabilities, they wouldn\u2019t have to fight so hard. They are now fighting in a life and death battle, which must be the last thing the one who\u2019s being hunted wished for.\u201d\u201cThe one exhausted is obviously the prey\u2026 As a man who is being hunted, he would never want to get into a tough fight against the enemy. If he has the capability to have a tough fight, he wouldn\u2019t even try to escape\u2026\u201d\u201cTo fight hand in hand, they have to get close to each other. The prey isn\u2019t a match to the hunter, so he will definitely take advantage of a strike to run away in high speed. However, the hunter has finally caught up\u2026 So the second close fight eventually happened.\u201d\u201cWhen they had their first close fight, the sound was not that loud. That means the hunter was restraining his strength. However, when the second close fight happened, the sound was a few notches louder. That means\u2026 After the first fight, the prey was hurt. Or maybe he was hurt\u2026 again\u2026\u201d\u201cTherefore\u2026 It seems like this battle is about to reach its conclusion.\u201d\u201cAfter less than another four close fights, the prey will eventually lose his strength to defend\u2026\u201d\u201cThey have been moving for over five hundred miles\u2026 They have obviously started the fight far away from the other side of the capital. They are truly top superior cultivators\u2026\u201dYe Xiao flew like the wind and cautiously approached.He was thinking, analyzing, estimating, but he was still calm and steady.Finally, he was close enough to the battle.Almost at the same time when he stopped, there came a huge explosion. \u2013 BOOM! \u2013 This time, it happened quite near to him. Endless dirt and grime flew up in the air, and then it all headed straight towards his direction. He quietly stayed down on the floor, allowing the dirt and grime to cover his body\u2026In the next moment, he was immediately smothered.He had become a \u2018sweat guy\u2019 earlier the night, and then now he became a \u2018dirt guy\u2019\u2026 Yet it disguised him rather well!A sound of someone panting was getting closer. According to the sound, this guy must be extremely exhausted. He might freak out, fall down and never get up at anytime.And then a sword flew over to him. It was covered by cold glow. \u2013 Shoot! \u2013 It stopped at a point about ten meters away in front of Ye Xiao. It was stabbed into a stone that was right in front of the exhausted guy.This sword served as an instrument to stop him from escaping and take his life!A lightning suddenly lit up the sky. \u2013 Shoo! \u2013 The stone still looked normal after the sword struck it. However, when the rain fell on the stone, the rock splat into four parts, it was like four petals blooming.The sword stood with its point sticking in the ground.In fact, it was inappropriate to use \u2019sticking\u2019 to describe it. The sword was totally exposed and not a single part of it was stuck inside the ground. However, it didn\u2019t fall down. It was just standing there flashing with a cold glow. It was actually floating in mid-air.Lightning once again flashed in the sky and the world was lit and turned dark again.The wild rain seemed to rule everything once more.The exhausted man looked at the sword as he suck in heavy breaths. Suddenly, he made an extremely hoarse laugh and then sat on the floor. He then spoke bitterly, \u201cYou win\u2026 Kill me as you wish. No more worthless conversations.\u201dYe Xiao was so close to them and he didn\u2019t dare to move even a single bit.After all, he was too close to the battle, and these two were top superior cultivators. The heavy rain had helped in concealing his existence. Otherwise, he must have been beaten up eight hundred times. The martial art he used to hide himself wasn\u2019t weak. However, the difference between his capability and theirs was too big.There was nothing else he could do.It was just that the place he picked was perfect to hide his whereabouts.It was a ramp of the forest and they were heading over to this ramp. They were about to pass through the ramp.If the prey went over the top of the ramp, he would definitely fall down to the other side of the ramp since he was exhausted. The hunter would jump down following the prey. Then Ye Xiao would be behind them.Because they went over Ye Xiao\u2019s location, they wouldn\u2019t be able to notice him since they would never keep an eye on the route they passed.So it was a perfect place to hide indeed.Basically, things should happen as Ye Xiao estimated. And it had been developing that way.However, something out of his expectation happened.The hunter actually threw his sword to force the prey to stop a few meters away from where he was hiding!The prey looked at the sword and thought that it was impossible for him to escape anymore. So he suddenly felt discouraged and couldn\u2019t get up his strength anymore. So he kind of accepted his fate and sat down on the floor\u2026Ye Xiao didn\u2019t care whether he sat down or not!The only thing that mattered to him was the fact that they were only seven meters away from him![What the hell is this! It really didn\u2019t go as I expected!] Ye Xiao cursed in mind, [For fxxk\u2019s sake, I am so unfortunate\u2026In such a short distance, facing two superior cultivators of the Grade of Tianyuan, no matter who found me first, I will certainly die!That is really clamping a bird when closing the door [1]\u2026 What an unfortunate coincidence\u2026]It was true that he was the Xiao Monarch who was wise and knowledgeable. So although he was in the third level of the Grade of Diyuan, he was invincible to all the others who were in the same level. Even those in the fourth or sixth level of the Grade of Diyuan couldn\u2019t be a match to him. If he really fought hard, he could even defeat the superior cultivators who were in the ninth level of the Grade of Diyuan!However, that was it. He was unable to win against someone who was in the Grade of Tianyuan. Someone in the Grade of Tianyuan could beat him easily in everything. Took Guan Zheng-Wen as an example, Ye Xiao was helpless in front of him.And these two in front of him were miles ahead of Guan Zheng-Wen in terms of cultivation capability.If he was exposed, any of these two could easily take his life. That was simply the absolute higher level suppressing the lower one. No one could do anything about it!Under such a negative situation, Ye Xiao was a bit distressed. At the same time, he had another feeling that was strange. [How come the voice of the prey is so familiar to me?Is it possible?It mustn\u2019t be!I have never been in-touch with such a high-level superior cultivator except for Guan Zheng-Wen!The prey shouldn\u2019t be Guan Zheng-Wen. Then who the hell is he?]While collecting his thoughts, he suddenly heard a soft voice, \u201cDo you really have to be like this?\u201dYe Xiao was shocked and he nearly exposed himself.[Shit! The hunter is the one I am actually familiar with!At least the hunter is someone whose name and background I could identify!The voice is so peaceful, soft, calm, ringing like the river running in the mountain, and could make people feel comfortable.It is the voice of\u2026The one who was in the auction\u2026 Xiu Of The Heavens!Lady Xiu-Er!She is the girl who is qualified enough to give orders in the House Of Chaotic Storm!She is the one who slaughtered every man of the Mu Clan in the capital![Oh my bloody heavenly holy gods\u2026] Ye Xiao\u2019s heart pounded hard several times, [How come I didn\u2019t realize this girl was a top superior cultivator in the Grandmaster Levels of Tianyuan?]When he pondered deeper about it, he recalled something suspicious.He had realized that Xiu Of The Heavens had an extraordinary capability, but Ye Xiao was sure that she shouldn\u2019t be as capable as she was now! In the auction, she was so far away from the Grade of Tianyuan, let alone the Grandmaster Levels of Tianyuan!Ye Xiao dared to swear with his sharp eyes and his life.And he was pretty sure that he hadn\u2019t seen her wrong!However, since their last meeting, it has only been a month. The girl had actually reached the Grandmaster Levels of Tianyuan from the Grade of Diyuan. Wasn\u2019t it boosted too much?[What\u2026 What the hell is going on?What the hell is it?!]The prey laughed hoarsely and said, \u201cI want to be clear about the truth before I die. You asked me whether it had to be like this or not. In fact, I want to ask you the same question. What made you hunt me like this?\u201dIn his voice, there was a sense of dejection. He was in despair.A top superior cultivator was about to die in the hands of a girl that seemed to be about seventeen years old during a fair fight. It was unacceptable for him as he had always been proud. He would even accept his demise, but he desperately wanted to know the truth!Xiu Of The Heavens stayed quiet for a while and spoke, \u201cNing Bi-Luo, I regarded you as an outstanding cultivator, so I invited you to join the House of Chaotic Storm\u2026 I promised you that as long as you join us, the assassination affairs of the House of Chaotic Storm will be under your command. You have the full power! Besides, I would solve the problem between you and the Saint Master. Such conditions are good enough no matter what. Yet you turned hostile and attacked in advance. Do you have an explanation for your actions?\u201dAt this moment, Ye Xiao actually remembered the prey at once.Ning Bi-Luo.The No.1 assassin in the Land of Han-Yang.However, he was a bit surprised. [How woeful this No.1 assassin is.]He had heard of him several times. When he heard about him for the second time, it was about his assassination organization fading away as Ning Bi-Luo fought his way to escape. At that moment, he was still on the run\u2026The first time he met Ning Bi-Luo was when he had just been set free from Wen-Ren Chu-Chu\u2019s grasp. It was a coincidence. That day, Ning Bi-Luo was being hunted and was fleeing madly. If Ye Xiao didn\u2019t do him a small favor, he might have died that day.At this moment, Ye Xiao met him again and he was still being hunted.

    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 94 \u2013 I Am An Assassin. Not A Dog![This guy has been hunted for quite a long time\u2026] Ye Xiao thought, [His experience of being hunted is not as miserable as mine, but it is quite woeful already\u2026]He didn\u2019t know that Ning Bi-Luo was being hunted because of him!Ning Bi-Luo sat on the floor dejectedly while breathing heavily and he asked, \u201cThe House of Chaotic Storm. I wonder whether you are Wan Of The Clouds or Xiu Of The Heavens?\u201dXiu-Er spoke blandly, \u201cI am Xiu-Er.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d Ning Bi-Luo smiled with self-mockery. He suddenly looked amused and said, \u201cTo die in a demon\u2019s hand, at least it won\u2019t stain my honorable name in the world.\u201dYe Xiao was surprised and thought, [Demon? What demon? What does he mean?]Xiu-Er\u2019s voice turned cold, \u201cNing Bi-Luo, do you know you just offended me?\u201dNing Bi-Luo rolled his eyelids and said while panting, \u201cI know. Of course I know\u2026 However, Lady Xiu-Er, even though you are powerful with all your hexes, you can only kill me once, right? You want to drag me back from hell and kill me again and again\u2026 Hey hey. Even if you really are a demon, I am afraid that\u2019s out of your capability. Right?\u201dWhile speaking, he actually laughed and said, \u201cI am unlucky to come across you while I am still carrying wounds. If I am fully recovered, I doubt that you can defeat me! Let\u2019s just say the gods didn\u2019t stand on my side!\u201dA figure in white fluttered. The slim figure of Xiu-Er appeared in Ye Xiao\u2019s sight. Even in the heavy rain, her clothes still looked clean and dry!She spoke, \u201cThere is no such thing as absolutely fair in the world. In the martial world, there is no such thing as justice either\u2026 Ning Bi-Luo, you are an assassin. Killing is normal for you. When you took people\u2019s lives, did you give them a fair chance to defend themselves? Yet now you spoke those words. Don\u2019t you think that what you said has stained your name? A man demeans himself right before his death. How pathetic.\u201dNing Bi-Luo stayed silent for a while and then spoke hoarsely, \u201cYou are right. I am hypocrite by saying that. Just end my life today. I won\u2019t complain anything about it.\u201dXiu-Er laughed and then spoke indifferently, \u201cYou know what. I don\u2019t want to kill you. What I want is to recruit you.\u201dNing Bi-Luo laughed and said, \u201cRecruit? In such a pleasant way?\u201dXiu-Er spoke calmly, \u201cThe House of Chaotic Storm hasn\u2019t recruited any true member for many years\u2026 Now that we are showing you our appreciation, why are you still unsatisfied? Does it really matter what way we used you?\u201dNing Bi-Luo coughed for a while. He then panted out, \u201cWhat a pity\u2026 I don\u2019t want to be a demon.\u201dThe coldness in Xiu-Er\u2019s eyes increased and her eagerness to kill turned heavier.Even though she was not looking at Ye Xiao, Ye Xiao felt a bit terrified at the moment\u2026\u201cYou have offended me over and over again. Ning Bi-Luo, as a man like you, it is immoderate to offend a lady like that.\u201d Her voice became peaceful again.Ning Bi-Luo was quiet.\u201cI want to know the true reason.\u201d Xiu-Er spoke blandly, \u201cThe House of Chaotic Storm is world-shocking\u2026 All the superior cultivators want to be a member of it, except you. Why?\u201dNing Bi-Luo spoke after a long silence, \u201cI know that what you said is true. However\u2026 I am a self-governed man. I am always the one who gives the orders, even though I am an assassin. Perhaps I have never been a good guy\u2026 But I will never be a dog!\u201dHe raised his head and spoke blandly and stoutly, \u201cI can be a bad guy, but I will never be a dog for others! Not even a dog for the king!\u201dXiu-Er stayed silent for a while before she said, \u201cGood. Good. You are a tough guy. I was underestimating you.\u201dNing Bi-Luo was motivated and laughed. He spoke proudly, \u201cI am born with an unyielding character! I don\u2019t think I can ever change it in this life.\u201d\u201cThe House of Chaotic Storm needs assassins this time. A man like you is someone I truly don\u2019t want to lose\u2026\u201d Xiu-Er sighed and said, \u201cThe guy, Red In The Sky, has been missing since his last mission. Ning Bi-Luo, I am giving you another chance here\u2026 You can still change your mind.\u201dNing Bi-Luo closed his eyes and mouth. He stayed silent.His attitude was obvious, [Just kill me. I won\u2019t change my goddamn mind!]Xiu-Er sighed of pity and had her last try, \u201cFine. I won\u2019t force you. However\u2026 Ning Bi-Luo, let me ask you another thing. If you can explain it clearly to me, and if your answer satisfies me, I will stop pushing you and give you a quick and nice death.\u201dNing Bi-Luo spoke with his eyes closed, \u201cOk. Go ahead.\u201d\u201cYou say you don\u2019t want to serve anybody and only wished to fight for yourself alone. That is your personal conviction, right?\u201d Xiu-Er asked, \u201cFor your whole life, you only obeyed yourself, is that true?\u201dNing Bi-Luo sneered, \u201cOf course. So I am. So I always have been. I will keep it so until I die! I won\u2019t ever regret it!\u201d\u201cIs that so? Then three years ago, why did you secretly lead all your men to the north and help Ye Nan-Tian kill a lot of the generals of the Northern Wolves?\u201d Xiu-Er spoke blandly, \u201cDon\u2019t you think you were a dog for Ye Nan-Tian? Were you not serving the king of the Kingdom of Chen?\u201d\u201cNonsense!\u201d Ning Bi-Luo suddenly opened his eyes and furiously said, \u201cThat\u2019s different! How could you bring it to the same topic?\u201dXiu-Er spoke poignantly, \u201cWhat you did was helping others! Don\u2019t tell me Ye Nan-Tian and the king had given you something as payment. If you said so, I won\u2019t be satisfied. You won\u2019t die today, or tomorrow, or the day after. You will be alive for a long time. You must know how it is to be begging for death. After that \u2018a long time\u2019, you will realize that death is a very precious and rare dream to you!\u201d\u201cI said. You can\u2019t associate these two things together. They were different essentially!\u201d Ning Bi-Luo shouted.\u201cOh? Tell me more!\u201d Xiu-Er spoke indifferently.\u201cIt had nothing to do with Ye Nan-Tian. I didn\u2019t help him. In fact\u2026 I had an enemy in the generals of the Northern Wolves. So I had to kill them! My clan was slaughtered a long time before that and it was that enemy who did it. You were wrong about me helping Ye Nan-Tian. For me, Ye Nan-Tian was helping me with my revenge.\u201d\u201cYe Nan-Tian won the battle because I killed those guys, but I didn\u2019t care about it and it had nothing to do with me. Ye Nan-Tian alone could surely win that battle without me.\u201dNing Bi-Luo spoke indifferently, \u201cYou said that I was a dog for Ye Nan-Tian. Well it was nonsense. We were just cooperating by coincidence!\u201dXiu-Er said, \u201cThen what about the second question?\u201dNing Bi-Luo stared at her with disdainful eyes and spoke blandly, \u201cIt turns out the wisdom of the Xiu Of The Heavens is just a joke. You actually keep questioning me about serving others?! Don\u2019t you see\u2026 Even if I have fought in the battle, even if I have fought for the Kingdom of Chen, even if I didn\u2019t have an enemy in the other side, it could never prove that I am a dog for the king!\u201d\u201cIt is simply because I am one of the people of the Kingdom of Chen!\u201dNing Bi-Luo spoke blandly, \u201cIt is about bloodline, about the country. It has nothing to do about personality or personal business. And it certainly has nothing to do about being a dog!\u201d\u201cEven though the royal court has been offering a reward for my head, when my country is in danger, I will stand forward to fight for her! Because this is the responsibility of the people in the country!\u201d\u201cI hate most of the men who works in the royal court. I hold no good feelings to the royal family. I don\u2019t give a shit to the king. I am simply a man in the martial world. Even in the martial world, I am an assassin which is always detested by the so-called noble men. But I will fight for my country when she needs me to!\u201dNing Bi-Luo sneered, \u201cI don\u2019t want to join you, because firstly, I don\u2019t want to be your dog, secondly\u2026 You guys have no idea how to be loyal to your country. You only care about rising and falling\u2026 Yet you don\u2019t care about who will rise and who will fall. I am different. I have my roots.\u201d\u201cWho rises and who falls\u2026 It includes my country! I can\u2019t just sit and wait doing nothing!\u201dNing Bi-Luo smiled, \u201cSo\u2026 You can recruit anyone you like, except me, the disreputable assassin!\u201d\u201cOr let\u2019s just say you don\u2019t have the capability to recruit me, because you can never afford the conditions I want!\u201d Ning Bi-Luo laughed.His words were solid in the heavy rain and the wild winds.It became silent!The world was covered by the rain and the wind.The rain was getting heavier.To see it from the top, the raindrops were like endless javelins falling from the sky to the earth!The mountains were like the ocean. Water was running everywhere\u2026The deafening sound of the flood had come over from the valley.Ning Bi-Luo was covered by dirt and gasping. He was in a difficult position. Yet the Xiu Of The Heavens was still in a suit of white clean clothes, like a faery from the heavens.However, Ye Xiao felt that Ning Bi-Luo contained more of the aura of a human being than Xiu Of The Heavens.Xiu Of The Heavens looked clean and saintly, yet she was full of the ruthlessness, \u2018looking at the world\u2019s suffering, I am still casual and elegant\u2019!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHer white clothes seemed so disgusting in the dark.\u20265th guaranteed chapter of the week.Translated by: RainEdited by: ArchPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 95 \u2013 The Purple Lotus Master!After a while\u2026Xiu-Er sighed and said, \u201cI guess we really have no such destiny that would tie us together. Let me fulfill your final wish and send you to your death.\u201dA sword light flashed!The end of her words signified Ning Bi-Luo\u2019s death!She swung her sword and a cold light moved quickly towards Ning Bi-Luo\u2019s neck.That was a sword without mercy, without any regard for life!Suddenly, she changed her motion. The sword light that was filled with killing intent was drawn back and held in front of her chest. \u2013 Bang! \u2013 It created some sparks. It suddenly illuminated the dark surroundings which bathed in the heavy rain, and then died out quietly.Her sword which was going to kill became a wall that she could use to defend herself!\u201cWho dares to initiate such a sneak attack in the dark?\u201d She put down her sword and stood still, with her sharp and cold eyes glancing at the brushwood.She caught the crystal that was used to attack her and was now held in between her fingers.It was cold. It was actually an ice cone.In the brushwood, Ye Xiao humphed and stood up. He spoke in a disdainful voice, \u201cI have heard that the House of Chaotic Storm was full of astuteness and resourcefulness and was the best in the Land of Han-Yang. But you actually do things as bad as compelling people to engage in prostitution. It turns out you are just good at these dirty pressing cunning schemes.\u201dRight now, he did not resemble either Ye Xiao or Feng Zhi-Ling.He was wearing a new face!At this moment, he was a slim man with a square face. He was about thirty years old. He was incomparably vigorous. He walked out into the rain with his shoulders steady. It looked like he was trying to take charge of all the raindrops.He had the vigor of \u2018peerless in the whole world and unexampled among all the great men\u2019 and he was full of confidence.Xiu-Er was shocked when she saw him.He casually walked over to her and it gave her a feeling similar to when she interacted with her own master who was so proud and elegant and despised the whole world![They\u2026 are so similar!]It immediately aroused her alertness.[This man must be a peerless superior cultivator!It is not ordinary for someone to give off the same impressions as master!]She was astonished and extremely cautious at the moment, yet she still looked calm and steady. Her face suddenly turned colder and she spoke blandly, \u201cCompelling people to engage in prostitution? You are talking nonsense. May I have your name? Do you realize that you are attempting to be our enemy by attempting to say such slander. Speaking wrong words could result in you being dragged into hell from the heavens!\u201dNing Bi-Luo\u2019s face was initially red and then quickly turned blue. [She is asking me to be the head of their assassins group. That may not be a decent job\u2026 I am lucky to have someone standing up for me, but this one actually talks like I am compelled to be a prostitute. So am I good at selling my body or what\u2026The way this man talks\u2026 is really unbelievable.]Ning Bi-Luo didn\u2019t know that Ye Xiao had to say so because he couldn\u2019t think of anything else to say when he was compelled to appear.Ning Bi-Luo was a tough guy.And Ye Xiao believed so.He thought it was worth his efforts to save such a guy!Besides\u2026 Ning Bi-Luo had once helped his father to kill the Northern Wolves. And he had also saved Ye Xiao once, although Ye Xiao had helped him kill those men that were chasing him. Well, those were different things though. Ning Bi-Luo had saved Ye Xiao while he was weak and helpless, and Ye Xiao helped him in a simple and easy way.Anyway, Ye Xiao believed that he should save Ning Bi-Luo this time!It would be a pity if a guy like him was killed.If Ye Xiao was to simply watch a guy like him die in his sight, it would simply result in a nightmare that he was never be able to get rid of.So, he had to save him!The question was how?!He was not capable enough. That was obvious!If he acted recklessly, he might fail to save Ning Bi-Luo and would also get himself killed in the process.While Ye Xiao was collecting his thoughts from within the brushwood, Xiu-Er had already made her move. It all happened very quickly, and in that tense moment, he instinctively took action in order to save Ning Bi-Luo.It was not his choice; it was his instinct!He didn\u2019t even think about the consequence when he struck.After the strike, when he looked at the cold eyes of Xiu-Er looking at him through the rain, he was terrified. [I am absolutely not a match for this woman now!What should I do?]Suddenly, he had an idea. He knew it was impossible to escape. There was only one thing he could do, so he casually walked out into the open.Facing this dangerous situation, he once again displayed the fearless vigor that he had carried in his previous life!He casually strode forward with his hands on his back and spoke blandly, \u201cIt is not important for you to know my identity. The affairs of the people in the martial world that have been caused by the way of the martial world should be solved by the means of the martial world. Now that I am at the sight of injustice, I have to simply render my help.\u201dXiu-Er calmly stared at him and sneered with her pretty face, \u201cRendering help at the sight of injustice huh? I didn\u2019t know that you are a knightly man\u2026 I wonder whether you have heard of this saying \u2018The one who wants to be a knightly man in the martial world\u2026 usually dies early.\u2019\u201dYe Xiao smiled blandly, \u201cThat is quite true. However, I have rendered my help so many times in my life, yet I am still alive. Even the House of Chaotic Storm has never hurt me, not even a scratch. I wonder whether I am an exception to that saying?\u201dXiu-Er\u2019s pupils shrank and she asked, \u201cWho are you?\u201dYe Xiao really had no other plans to deal with the current situation, so he had to keep playing. He casually put his hands on his back and spoke blandly, \u201cHow is Master Bai by the way?\u201dXiu-Er was a bit surprised and confused and then she spoke angrily, \u201cDo you really think that it would make me believe you or fear you by mentioning Master Bai?\u201dYe Xiao smiled blandly and reached out his hand. A purple cold qi in the shape of a ball suddenly appeared in his hand. The heavy rain couldn\u2019t even dampen it. The purple qi slowly transformed into something like a purple jade, and then it unfolded slowly and turned into a small purple lotus. The lotus bloomed in his hand.The small lotus was vividly purple. It was peaceful and calm in the heavy rain, spreading the aura of mystery. The process that turned it from the purple qi to a purple lotus was magical. However, Ye Xiao\u2019s hand didn\u2019t move a bit.It remained still, as if saying that it was only natural.Yet the purple lotus just appeared in his hand from nothing.What a magical and fantastic scene!Immediately when the lotus was formed, an extreme cold qi spread out, enveloping everything within 30 meters of the lotus!Ye Xiao\u2019s hand reached out steadily and his eyes were half-closed. He was staring at the lotus attentively. He spoke casually, \u201cI wonder if you have heard about this from Master Bai?\u201dXiu-Er\u2019s eyes were filled with surprise again and she looked at it carefully. She looked around the lotus and then spoke blandly, \u201cWhat is it?\u201dHer curiosity had calmed Ye Xiao down a lot.[As long as you don\u2019t just come to me and fight like a mad dog, it will be an easy job for me to fool a little girl like you with my great experience.]Ye Xiao sighed and spoke slowly, \u201cThe world is great; the purple lotus is faint. It lives through the ages; it circulates through centuries. It blooms; death comes. It falls; the sky shines. \u2026\u201dIt was a pet phrase used by a top superior cultivator whom he had killed in his previous life. He was called the Purple Lotus Master.With the purple lotus, he killed the dissenters; in the universe, he governed worlds!(\u7d2b\u83b2\u4e3a\u4ee4\uff0c\u4e0d\u670d\u8005\u6740\uff1b\u7eb5\u6a2a\u5b87\u5185\uff0c\u53f7\u4ee4\u5929\u4e0b\uff01)However, he was unlucky to mess with the Xiao Monarch. Ye Xiao had chased him for three thousand miles and killed him with his own hands. After that, the whole Purple Lotus Gang was wiped out.Yet, no one in the Qing-Yun Realm knew about it, because the Purple Lotus Master was always mysterious and the Xiao Monarch always did such things secretly.At this very moment, Ye Xiao needed to act like someone powerful, so he spoke the phrase.He was sure that nobody would know about the Purple Lotus Master in the mortal world anyway.However, when he finished the phrase, Xiu-Er\u2019s expression suddenly changed!She had been calm all along, yet she actually took a deep breath and fearfully stepped back. She asked, \u201cYou\u2026 you are the Purple Lotus Master?\u201dYe Xiao was astonished.[She\u2026 She has actually heard of that guy?A girl in the mortal world actually knows about the Purple Lotus Master?The guy was a very mysterious figure in the Qing-Yun Realm. He was always acting strange and it was extremely difficult to see his true face. Many people know about the Purple Lotus, yet, very few of them know about the Purple Lotus Master.]Ye Xiao pretended to be relieved and said, \u201cHmm\u2026 Your master didn\u2019t forget his old friend, I hope.\u201dHe was talking politely, yet his mind was agitated![The girl actually knows about the Purple Lotus Owner. Her master shouldn\u2019t be an enemy of the dead guy, should he? So\u2026 In fact\u2026 Are they friends or enemies?] Ye Xiao had no idea.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euNo wonder that the girl had looked at the lotus for a while. She was checking if it was real\u2026 wasn\u2019t she?\u2026The sponsored chapter from last week.

Why Did You Save Me?Ye Xiao rejoiced in his mind, [Thank god that I acted so well. Even if the dead Purple Lotus Master was alive, he would have failed to make a purple lotus that was better than mine\u2026Otherwise, I would surely be exposed, wouldn\u2019t I?]Ye Xiao realized that things were going in an unpredictable and strange direction ever since he had shown the purple lotus\u2026Xiu-Er was visibly more cautious and she asked in a low voice, \u201cI didn\u2019t know who you were\u2026 It was said that you were hunted by the peerless Xiao Monarch in the Qing-Yun Realm. After that, no one has ever heard about you\u2026 We all thought that you were\u2026\u201dYe Xiao shook his head slowly and showed hatred on his face. He said, \u201cThe Xiao Monarch is indeed the most terrifying person in the Qing-Yun Realm. I am clearly not a match for him. In fact, if he hadn\u2019t kept hunting me like a mad dog, how would I have ended up in this realm\u2026 Oh.\u201dWhile he was making up a story, his pulse quickened.[She actually knows that I hunted the Purple Lotus Master?That is weird!Who is this Xiu-Er? And the master behind her? Where are they from?How come I have never heard of them?There are not many people who know what happened\u2026 Anyone who knows is a great figure in the world\u2026 But I don\u2019t have any memories about Master Bai of the House of Chaotic Storm. Why\u2026That is\u2026 extremely weird!Unbelievable!And the way she talked to me doesn\u2019t seem fearful or respectful.Apparently, she is not afraid of the Purple Lotus Master!Why is that? Even in the Qing-Yun Realm, there will be no more than 200 people who would dare to talk to the Purple Lotus Master like that. I don\u2019t think there is a man named Bai among those 200 people.She is just a maid, yet she doesn\u2019t fear the Purple Lotus Master\u2026]Ye Xiao was shocked, [This will surely lead to complications later on!]Xiu-Er had, by now, confirmed that he was the Purple Lotus Master.After all, she had the same thought process as Ye Xiao, [In the mortal world, there are only the master, Wan-Er and me who know about the Purple Lotus Master!It is impossible for other people to know about it.And no one can speak out the pet phrase used by the Purple Lotus Master.]She then smiled and said, \u201cIt is my pleasure to meet you in person. I have some good news for you\u2026 Your enemy, the Xiao Monarch was hunted down by the three factions three months ago. He was eventually slaughtered!\u201d\u201cWhat the hell!\u201dThe rough words escaped Ye Xiao\u2019s lips.He wasn\u2019t pretending this time. He was truly astonished![Why does this girl know everything?She actually knows that I got killed?What the hell is going on?!Is there a communicating channel connecting the Qing-Yun Realm and the mortal world?That\u2026 That is too unbelievable!]\u201cIt is true!\u201d Xiu-Er thought that he was shocked by the news itself, so she nodded and said.For Xiu-Er, it was reasonable for the Purple Lotus Master to be surprised. The Xiao Monarch was arrogant and peerless. Such an invincible figure wouldn\u2019t naturally have been killed so easily!Xiu-Er herself didn\u2019t believe it before she confirmed the news three times!\u201cThe Xiao Monarch\u2026 He\u2026 He actually died\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao showed a strange expression. It was like mourning, and also like regret, or a bit like hatred, but it was mostly an indescribable blankness\u2026Such expression was exactly what the Purple Lotus Master would have shown if he was alive and had heard the news.Xiu-Er looked at him and was now certain that it was the Purple Lotus Master who was actually standing before her.\u201cHe actually died\u2026 Heh heh heh\u2026\u201d Ye Xiao laughed in a sad way and spoke, \u201cHow come he died so soon?\u201dIn Xiu-Er\u2019s mind it was naturally translated into \u2018how can he die so soon before I can get my revenge and kill him myself\u2026\u2019.Xiu-Er looked at him and a sense of disdain flashed in her eyes.She thought, [You are nothing but a loser who was hunted by the Xiao Monarch and escaped to such a low-class world\u2026 Yet you are actually thinking about revenge? That is truly just your stupid dream. If you really wanted that revenge, why didn\u2019t you go back to take it?You have no guts to return to the Qing-Yun Realm. That\u2019s all. Do you really think you are still that Purple Lotus Master\u2026]Naturally, she didn\u2019t dare to speak it out.The Purple Lotus Master might be just some garbage for the Xiao Monarch, yet he was still someone she absolutely shouldn\u2019t mess with!Xiu-Er suddenly spoke in low voice, \u201cAre you hurt?\u201dYe Xiao became cautious immediately and spoke indifferently, \u201cIf I was not\u2026 How would I come to this place\u2026 It was a sad story of mine anyway. However, I guess I am going to return.\u201dHe meant that his wounds were mostly cured, or completely cured.Xiu-Er glanced at him and said, \u201cWell. Why do you want to save this man?\u201dYe Xiao spoke inscrutably, \u201cI surely have my concerns to save him. I am afraid it is inconvenient for me to tell you about it. Would you please do me a favor? What do you think?\u201dXiu-Er smiled and said, \u201cSince the Purple Lotus Master has given his word, I must step back\u2026 Since this bloody Ning Bi-Luo doesn\u2019t want to join us, it will be fine to let him join you\u2026 However, now that you are in the mortal world and it seems you are going back to the upper realm soon, I wonder if you could do me a favor too?\u201dYe Xiao frowned, \u201cA favor? As a return? I don\u2019t want to owe people. Go ahead!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t dare to talk about returning to you. I just want to ask you to help us with one thing. I don\u2019t know what it would be at this moment though. But I will come to you as soon as I have decided upon it\u2026\u201d Xiu-Er smiled, \u201cAs long as you promise, I will leave right away.\u201dYe Xiao increasingly felt that this Xiu-Er and that Master Bai were no ordinary people.Facing the cruel and well-known Purple Lotus Master, she actually dared to make a request\u2026She was truly a ticklish person. As a maid was this ticklish, who knew what her master was like!\u201cYou meant you don\u2019t have anything that needs my help right now?! I won\u2019t make such a promise!\u201d Ye Xiao shook his head stoutly, \u201cIf it turns out that you want me to do something that I shall never do or just want me to kill myself for fun, how can I fulfill my promise then? The foundation of a deal was that both sides consider it as a fair deal. Do you really think you have the right to ask me for everything you want like that?!\u201dXiu-Er\u2019s eyes lit up with a cold glow, [This Purple Lotus Master knows that I have a low cultivation strength, so he actually despises me. I will get to him sooner or later for this.] She was furious, but remained smiling, \u201cYou are misunderstanding me. My request will never cause you any embarrassment. It will go no further than requesting you to kill a target.\u201d\u201cWell it is not a difficult thing\u2026 to kill a person\u2026 In this world, even killing a king is an easy job.\u201d Ye Xiao acted vigorous and said, \u201cIn that case, I will say yes, since your request is just that simple.\u201d[I just need to get off all this today. And you can go to the Purple Lotus Master if you want him to fulfill his promise, only if you can find him\u2026]\u201cYou are a straightforward man. I will leave Ning Bi-Luo to you then.\u201d Xiu-Er\u2019s white clothes fluttered. Her sword flashed and then disappeared. She was standing still, slim and tall, but the sword was nowhere in sight. It was really well hidden.\u201cIf you have time, please come to the House of Chaotic Storm to talk to our master. He would be very happy to see you.\u201d Xiu-Er spoke with smile. When she spoke the word \u2018master\u2019, she was obviously proud and restrained.Ye Xiao realized that this Master Bai must be at a higher position than the Purple Lotus Master!He then smiled and said, \u201cWhen I am fully recovered, I will naturally go visit Master Bai and Lady Xiu-Er.\u201d\u201cYou will be welcomed anytime. It is quite a difficult thing to have a chat with an old friend in this mortal world\u2026\u201d Her clothes floated and she flew up like a fairy. She moved backward and spoke gently with a peaceful smile, \u201cSee you soon.\u201dAnd then a stream of white silk rushed away. Suddenly in the rain, there appeared a pristine white bridge. It gave the impression that it would lead you to the end of the world\u2026Xiu-Er\u2019s slim body was walking on the bridge in the sky. She looked so beautiful and peaceful. She appeared to be moving slowly, but was infact travelling at a rapid pace. With her floating white clothes, soon she disappeared in the rain.She didn\u2019t even glance at Ning Bi-Luo.Her white clothes didn\u2019t even get a raindrop or any dirt on itself!She came clean and white and she left clean and white.Under the boundless heavy rain.\u2026Ye Xiao moved closer to Ning Bi-Luo who sat on the floor, looking at him with extreme fear and asked, \u201cWho are you? What is Purple Lotus Master? Why did you save me? What do you want?\u201dNing Bi-Luo was known as the No.1 assassin in the world, yet after all, that title only applied to the mortal world.He knew nothing about the Qing-Yun Realm.\u201cYou just asked me four questions in a row. You really can talk in one breath! Well you don\u2019t need to know who I am or where I\u2019m from. I will only tell you one thing. I saved you just because I could. That\u2019s all.\u201d Ye Xiao spoke indifferently, \u201cCan you move?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euNing Bi-Luo gritted his teeth and held his hands on the floor. He stood up constrainedly and took a deep breath. He said, \u201cSure! My legs and arms are all fine.

    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 97 \u2013 Anti-tracking!Ning Bi-Luo stood up, but his legs were trembling.Apparently, he had reached the limits of his strengt. He was supporting his body with just willpower. It seemed that taking a single step would cause him to fall down.He was truly a tough guy!Ye Xiao stepped forward and held his arm.He wouldn\u2019t want to see a tough guy embarrassed. Not even in front of his own eyes.He spoke blandly, \u201cDon\u2019t push yourself. It will be a big joke if you let yourself fall and die because of it. Including this time, I have saved your ass twice already. I don\u2019t want to learn that I have saved a dead man!\u201dNing Bi-Luo raised his head and his eyes became sharp, \u201cYou? It\u2019s you?!\u201d\u201cHush! Don\u2019t you feel tired shouting that loudly? Do you really think that you are at the peak of your health? Do you really want to make everyone know of your location?!\u201d Ye Xiao pointed his finger upwards.Ning Bi-Luo stopped talking, yet his face showed that he was thrilled.[My savior!]He had been hunted and nearly died that time. Ye Xiao was the one who saved his life! Nobody else knew about it\u2026 So when Ning Bi-Luo was sure Ye Xiao was his savior when he hear what Ye Xiao said!Ye Xiao took out a Pei-Yuan Dan Bead and put it into Ning Bi-Luo\u2019s mouth right away.Ning Bi-Luo was a bit annoyed being fed forcibly, yet Ye Xiao was his savior who had saved him twice, so he didn\u2019t resist. When the dan bead went into his mouth, he felt a stream of hot qi suddenly scatter inside his mouth and then rush into his belly. After that, the qi spread around his Jing and Mai. Suddenly, he felt his weak body became indescribably comfortable.His dantian had been empty, yet now as the hot qi kept running into it, it produced some energy. And then the disengaged qi in his dantian started to gather together. His whole body had regained energy and vigor in a matter of seconds.Ning Bi-Luo was spirited and said, \u201cWhat is it? It is actually so wonderful.\u201dYe Xiao spoke blandly, \u201cNothing special. Just a supreme dan bead!\u201dNing Bi-Luo was shocked again.He stopped talking.[He has saved me twice. And now he has given me the precious supreme dan bead!I continue to owe him more and more.Considering the return\u2026]Ning Bi-Luo thought, [His cultivation capability must be enormous. He is a least stronger than Xiu Of The Heavens. He made the girl leave by only telling her his name. He is at least in a level that is higher than the limit of this world\u2026 What can I possibly give him in return? Things I have will only embarrass me if I take them out!]Ye Xiao held Ning Bi-Luo and they headed to the city slowly. When they were walking, the Pei-Yuan Dan Bead continued operating. Ning Bi-Luo\u2019s body started to operate his cultivation automatically. He had already recovered half of his strength. It was not enough for him to fight yet, but it was enough to let him move freely.Ye Xiao naturally stopped holding him.Such heavy rain was truly rare. It didn\u2019t let off at all. It rained cats and dogs on the whole world.They made sure that it was safe around them and then took a break in an abandoned shed.Ning Bi-Luo was exhausted and Ye Xiao had experience astonishment.\u201cThanks.\u201d Ning Bi-Luo rested for a while and then stood up again.He didn\u2019t seem to like sitting. As long as he was able to, he would stand, \u201cI am not a man who is good at saying sweet words. Anyway, if there is anything you need me for, just give me a word. I will do whatever I am capable of for you.\u201dYe Xiao smiled and looked at him without saying a word.Ning Bi-Luo was annoyed, \u201cAre you looking down upon me? Are you thinking that you won\u2019t have anything that a man like me can help with?\u201dYe Xiao smiled, \u201cNo. I am just curious since you are exhausted and you have time to rest now, why aren\u2019t you sitting down?\u201dNing Bi-Luo was quiet for a while and then spoke, \u201cDo you think I don\u2019t want to rest. I am an assassin. An assassin has no comfortable life. As long as I am still standing, I can stay alert. Once I sit down\u2026 and get used to it, laziness will keep me down forever. Even if I can resist the laziness and stand up again, it won\u2019t be the same! I shall just give up \u2018sitting\u2019 and get used to standing. That\u2019s all.\u201dYe Xiao nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s true. That\u2019s reasonable. You are truly the No.1 assassin in the Land of Han-Yang!\u201dHe stopped and then continued, \u201cHowever, I don\u2019t have anything you can help with. I am just being honest.\u201d He stood up and spoke blandly, \u201cNow that you are fine, and you have enough energy to defend yourself, I think I should better be off now.\u201dNing Bi-Luo wouldn\u2019t have thought that in the raining night, someone actually saved him and asked nothing for return. He was surprised, \u201cYou\u2026 You saved me for nothing? Really?\u201dYe Xiao became silent for a while and then spoke with his back to him, \u201cAt the beginning, I had a purpose. But\u2026 You said that you wouldn\u2019t serve anybody\u2026 So I don\u2019t want to push you. Besides\u2026 It is never a bad thing to have another friend in the martial world. You don\u2019t need to bear it in mind.\u201dRight before he finished talking, he had disappeared in the heavy rain.He had carried the thought of recruiting Ning Bi-Luo.But as he said, Ning Bi-Luo had shown his attitude that he didn\u2019t want to serve anybody.It wouldn\u2019t be helpful for Ye Xiao to force him.It would break his faith in Ye Xiao if he were to push him around as his savior. It was impossible for him to do so!Moreover\u2026 He knew that he was really too weak at the moment. If Ning Bi-Luo found out his true status and his true strength, it would be too embarrassing for him. Currently, no one in the House of Ye was a match for Ning Bi-Luo.Although Ye Xiao believed that Ning Bi-Luo wasn\u2019t an ungrateful guy, he knew that they would feel very uncomfortable if Ning Bi-Luo found out the truth.Ye Xiao was a carefree guy, so he decided against recruiting him upon pondering deeply.He couldn\u2019t recruit Ning Bi-Luo anyway, so he decided to just leave and let Ning Bi-Luo remember him.Ning Bi-Luo watched Ye Xiao leaving. He wanted to say something, yet he didn\u2019t. He could only stare blankly.\u201cAt the beginning, I had a purpose. But\u2026 You said that you wouldn\u2019t serve anybody\u2026 So I don\u2019t want to push you.\u201dWhat Ye Xiao had said made Ning Bi-Luo thrilled.\u201cWhat he wanted, was to recruit me\u2026\u201d\u201cYet he gave up after he heard what I said to Xiu Of The Heavens. And he just left. He didn\u2019t even say anything about what he wanted\u2026 Apparently, he is a man with extreme pride!\u201d\u201cHe didn\u2019t want me to struggle in difficulty, and he didn\u2019t want to be embarrassed too. So he just went away and left everything behind.\u201dNing Bi-Luo was thinking.\u201cBut I am not an ungrateful man, am I?\u201d\u201cHowever\u2026 Do I really want to be his underling? Isn\u2019t it against my will to serve him?\u201d Ning Bi-Luo was collecting his thoughts but couldn\u2019t find any answers. He eventually shook his head. [I can\u2019t resist my will. I can\u2019t be your servant. But I will offer my help anytime you need me!]He then rushed into the rain like a speedy arrow.He was heading in the same direction as Ye Xiao.He was at the Grandmaster Levels of Tianyuan. In the Land of Han-Yang, he was one of the most powerful men. Although he only recovered half of his strength, he was still much stronger than Ye Xiao.Ye Xiao wasn\u2019t in hurry when he was heading back to the city, and he wasn\u2019t in his best condition, so he didn\u2019t use the One Laughter in Skyline or Lunisolar Shadow. He wasn\u2019t moving very fast.That\u2019s why Ning Bi-Luo could easily sense his trace before he arrived at the city.Ning Bi-Luo was surprised. In fact, he was shocked. And then he thought that Ye Xiao must have known that he would follow up\u2026 So Ye Xiao intended to let him catch up.Ning Bi-Luo was convinced that Ye Xiao was much stronger than him. Even in his best condition, he would never be a match for Ye Xiao. Besides, he was hurt at the moment!However, Ye Xiao hadn\u2019t turned his back at all.The next moment, something happened which surprised Ning Bi-Luo more. When Ye Xiao was about to get into the Chen-Xing City, he actually took a breath before he leaped over the tall and huge wall.The rain was hitting Ning Bi-Luo\u2019s face. He was astonished.He really couldn\u2019t understand it. What Ye Xiao had shown had really confused him.[He actually took a breath before he jumped over the wall?! It was nothing but a wall. Yet he actually needed to take a breath? That\u2026 That was even worse than me! No. It was much worse than me\u2026 What is going on? Maybe he was hiding his capability, but who was he hiding from?][If he wasn\u2019t hiding anything\u2026 What gave him guts to save me from the grasp of Xiu Of The Heavens?]Ning Bi-Luo was confused.And then he recalled the first time Ye Xiao had saved him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThat day, he was hunted by the men of the Boundless Lord. He was wounded and he had to operate a lot of healing martial arts to cure himself. He was trying to leave secretly after he got through the fight, yet his enemies found him\u2026\u20262nd regular chapter of the weekTranslated by: RainEdited by: Alpha, ArchPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 98 \u2013 How is it possible?Ning Bi-Luo remembered that the three men who had been hunting him didn\u2019t have high cultivation levels. They were just at the first stage of the Grade of Tianyuan. However, Ning Bi-Luo had run out of energy at that time. Because his secret martial art had rebounded onto himself, he was badly weakened. If not for the assailants fearing his reputation and not daring to fight head on, he would have died a long time ago.His enemies didn\u2019t fight him using their utmost efforts, but he was badly injured. When he was escaping, he met Ye Xiao. He showed mercy towards him and pushed him away and was surprisingly saved by him. He remembered the face. He would never forget it.And he would never forget the shocking power of the gelid qi.However, this time, Ye Xiao had changed his appearance. That was the reason why Ning Bi-Luo couldn\u2019t recognize him.Until Ye Xiao said \u2018I have saved you twice\u2019 to disclose his identity after saving him from the Xiu Of The Heavens, Ning Bi-Luo was sure Ye Xiao was his savior.As Ning Bi-Luo thought deeper about it, there seemed to be many strange facts popping up here and there.Things seemed to be suspicious to him at the moment. The last time in the long street was his first contact with Ye Xiao. While he was busy fleeing, he protected Ye Xiao from danger. It was rather easy for him to push Ye Xiao that time.If Ye Xiao had been a peerless cultivator, it wouldn\u2019t be so easy to push him away. In fact, Ning Bi-Luo had pushed Ye Xiao away so easily, although he was weak at that moment. That meant Ye Xiao was truly not that strong!However, it didn\u2019t matter how strong Ye Xiao was, and it didn\u2019t matter how he saved Ning Bi-Luo. It was not important to Ning Bi-Luo! The truth was that Ye Xiao actually saved Ning Bi-Luo!Although Ye Xiao was weak, he had saved Ning Bi-Luo twice. For Ning Bi-Luo, this fact was more than enough to be grateful.However, what Ning Bi-Luo noticed was that this Purple Lotus Master seemed to be totally different from the guy in the long street. Different appearances. Different behaviors. Different ethos. They were totally different men!Well, he was right about it though. That day in the long street, Ye Xiao was \u2018Feng Zhi-Ling\u2019. The funny part was that Xiu-Er knew Feng Zhi-Ling well. So apparently, Ye Xiao couldn\u2019t show up looking like Feng Zhi-Ling this time.That\u2019s why Ye Xiao disguised himself with the appearance of the true Purple Lotus Master. So of course, Ning Bi-Luo could believe they were the same person!While Ning Bi-Luo thought further, he noticed a few more suspicious points. He was confused.At the moment, Ye Xiao had disappeared. Ning Bi-Luo followed up in a hurry. He was so confused that he had an incredible urge to find out the truth.He climbed over the wall effortlessly, as if flying. Ye Xiao was unable to do it as breezily and elegantly as he could.The capability of a man in the Grandmaster Levels of Tianyuan wasn\u2019t a joke.Even though it was raining heavily, he could still sense the direction where Ye Xiao was heading and followed him silently.On the other hand, Ye Xiao had absolutely no idea that he was being followed.He thought that Ning Bi-Luo would just leave after he had gone away.The capital was truly a place full of troubles for Ning Bi-Luo at the moment. Even though he wouldn\u2019t encounter the Xiu Of The Heavens, he would still be in a tough situation because he was now a rat on the street in the capital\u2026Anyway, Ye Xiao believed that Ning Bi-Luo would never follow him!It was quite a simple truth. [You don\u2019t want to serve anybody, so I won\u2019t force you to. I have saved you twice and I don\u2019t have any requests from you\u2026 It all clearly pointed the truth that you owe me a lot and I owe you nothing\u2026Then what reason do you have to follow me?]Apparently, he was wrong about it this time. Even a wise man who had made a thousand right decisions could make mistakes after all. From his perspective, he had nothing more to do with Ning Bi-Luo, but from Ning Bi-Luo\u2019s perspective, he couldn\u2019t understand how the two men who had saved him could be the same guy. Besides, he was saved twice and was unable to repay the debts. So he was upset. So he eventually decided to follow Ye Xiao!Ye Xiao didn\u2019t know he was being followed, but he was cautious as usual. He had changed directions several times to check out if anybody was following him and then quietly went back to his house when he felt safe.What he had done was enough to escape from most of the people in this world.It was even enough to escape from those top superior cultivators like the Xiu Of The Heavens.Yet, it was not enough to escape from Ning Bi-Luo.Ning Bi-Luo was one of the most capable cultivators in this world, yet he was still far from being the No.1 cultivator. However, he was the No.1 assassin in the Land of Han-Yang.Tracking and sneaking were the special skills of an assassin.He could sneak away by taking advantage of the tiniest of opportunity and flee far away, even when facing someone who was much stronger than him\u2026With the same line of reasoning, it was never a difficult task for him to track people whom others were unable to track.He was the best assassin and also the best tracker!That was why he could catch up with Ye Xiao.But he was surprised!From the whole tracking process, he was sure about one thing; his savior was not a top superior cultivator like he had thought; instead, he was quite weak in cultivation.He found that Ye Xiao\u2019s cultivation capability was far lower than his own and was even under the Grade of Tianyuan!According to that, Ning Bi-Luo began to speculate that this Purple Lotus Master could be the same guy who was at the long street. They were both men with a low cultivation capability.Yet he had been saved by this man twice from the hands of some superior cultivators who were at the Grade of Tianyuan!That was however the first strange thing.There was second strange thing\u2026 He found that Ye Xiao was extremely cautious, even more cautious than himself. In such a heavy rain, Ye Xiao was sure that nobody would follow him, yet he changed his direction for dozens of times. Even though Ning Bi-Luo was quite good at tracking, he had nearly lost him several times.In fact, he had lost him, but he had a strong spiritual sensation, had abundance of experience in tracking, and he had recovered most of his strength, so he was luckily able to get back on track.If he had been lacking in any of these three departments, he could never have kept up with Ye Xiao!So he was sure about one thing, [In this world, nobody except me can keep following him. Others would surely be left behind! That is an absolute fact!]\u201cWell maybe there is another one who can do the same as me\u2026 Red In The Sky. Maybe he can catch up. Who knows!\u201dNing Bi-Luo murmured.He couldn\u2019t think of anyone else who was as capable in tracking as himself. He thought that Ye Xiao was more lubricious than a loach, more deceitful than a fox!Finally, Ning Bi-Luo saw Ye Xiao enter the House of Ye. Even though he was an experienced man, he couldn\u2019t help being astonished.[This guy\u2026 is actually\u2026 from General Ye Nan-Tian\u2019s house?]He then flew into the house like a wind without hesitation.The rainy dark night was a best cover for a stalker.He arrived at the roof of Ye Xiao\u2019s room easily and lowered his body.Ye Xiao entered his room and finally took a breath of relief. He thought that everything was settled!He was preparing to return to his true appearance, yet he had a strange feeling and he didn\u2019t know why.He felt like he was being watched by someone else. It made him feel uncomfortable!\u201cWhat is wrong? Am I followed?\u201d Ye Xiao murmured in mind.He then jumped up and rushed into the rain again. \u2013 Poof!- He got to the roof immediately.When he was going to check around, he saw Ning Bi-Luo lying in front of him!At that moment, Ye Xiao was shocked!And Ning Bi-Luo was shocked too![You have returned to your house\u2026 I am already lying on your roof\u2026 Yet you actually came out again!Could you even be more cautious buddy\u2026]The stalking specialist Ning Bi-Luo hadn\u2019t thought that Ye Xiao would come out again. So when Ye Xiao was standing beside him, he was still lying on the roof like a fool\u2026\u201cOh! It is you!\u201d When Ye Xiao saw Ning Bi-Luo lying on the roof like a fool, he couldn\u2019t help feeling a bit dizzy![What the hell! I was so cautious all the way back, yet I actually missed this guy!He could actually follow me to my own house and I actually failed to notice it\u2026]At this moment, Ye Xiao was rather frustrated.At the same time, he felt an eagerness to improve himself. [If I am what I was in my previous life, do you really think that you could stalk me? In the past, I could kill you by simply breathing out! Damn it! I am too weak!]After a while, they both entered Ye Xiao\u2019s room and looked at each other without uttering a word.It was raining so heavily that staying outside in the rain was simply out of the question. When Ye Xiao discovered that it was Ning Bi-Luo, he stopped being contentious and said, \u201cCome on in.\u201dNing Bi-Luo was stunned and he just followed him in. It seemed he was still unable to understand the whole situation.\u201cWell\u2026 This\u2026 This is your room?\u201d Ning Bi-Luo sat on the luxurious chair. He was a bit speechless.\u201cYes.\u201d Ye Xiao wiped and dried his clothes with a towel.Ning Bi-Luo didn\u2019t use such an inconvenient way. He naturally use the method that people of the martial world usually did: Operating the QI!Some mist appeared around his body right away and then his clothes became dry in just a second\u2026\u201cIs\u2026 Is this your home?\u201d Ning Bi-Luo was still a bit blank.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu[How\u2026 How is it possible?]\u20263rd guaranteed chapter of the week.Translated by: RainEdited by: Alpha, ArchPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 99 \u2013 How To Be IndifferentThere were very few things in the world that could make Ning Bi-Luo feel shocked to this extent.Yet what happened at that moment had really astonished him to an unprecedented degree.\u201cWhat are you talking about\u2026 This is my room. What else can it be if not my home?\u201d Ye Xiao showed his back to him while carefully removing the disguise on his face.There was no need for him to wear a disguise now, so he decided to show some sincerity.\u201cI see. It turns out you are Ye Nan-Tian! The great general! No wonder there has been no one who knows about your background. It turns out you are from the higher realm and you are here to escape your troubles! You are so weak now. Is it because you are suffering some illness?\u201dNing Bi-Luo looked at Ye Xiao\u2019s back. He was enlightened and said, \u201cHmm\u2026 Aren\u2019t you supposed to stay in the north? Why are you here\u2026\u201d\u201cNow I know why you saved me. You knew me for a long time\u2026\u201dYe Xiao felt funny and he turned around showing Ning Bi-Luo a big smile, \u201cI am not the General Ye.\u201dAt the moment, he was wearing his true face.His handsome face which was a bit boyish was revealed to Ning Bi-Luo.Ning Bi-Luo was astonished when he saw his boyish look![Damn it! I made a wrong guess again?]\u201cYou\u2026 You, you, you\u2026\u201d Ning Bi-Luo opened his mouth and looked at the face which belonged to a boy who was younger than 18. At that moment, he felt his brain exploding.That was a feeling of \u2018the whole world went wrong\u2019 in his brain.Ning Bi-Luo thought that the Purple Lotus Master was the great General Ye Nan-Tian. That conclusion could perfectly explain every question in his mind. However, when Ye Xiao\u2019s true face was revealed to him, those questions in his mind returned once again!His brain was blank for a long while.Ye Xiao gave him a big smile, \u201cWhat? Is it really that surprising?\u201dNow he had clearly seen the No.1 assassin\u2019s face.He was slim; he was neither tall nor short, only in average height, a little bit shorter than Ye Xiao himself. He was not handsome, but not ugly either.His eyes looked like there was an ocean in them; they were sharp like swords.He would be absolutely inconspicuous amongst a crowd. He truly had the first quality to be an assassin \u2013 inconspicuousness. However, when such a man burst out, he would be shining like a star. He would shock the whole world within a few seconds!Yet it seemed that he was not very up to standards at the moment\u2026Because right now\u2026 he was looking at Ye Xiao\u2019s face with his mouth trembling. After a long while, he had finally pulled himself together and sat on the chair dispiritedly. He spoke weakly, \u201cPlease tell me the truth. Is the man who have saved me twice really you? Isn\u2019t he someone else?\u201dYe Xiao laughed, \u201cWhat? You have a problem with it? Do you think I need to lie to you about it?\u201d\u201cIt turns out\u2026 Twice, you have only shown me your disguised face\u2026 There was only one truth. You are weak.\u201d Ning Bi-Luo\u2019s appearance was quite funny at the moment. His expression was changing continuously.Ye Xiao was bland. He didn\u2019t reply, but only collected the thoughts in his mind, [Screw you. I have saved you twice. You have some words to say. That\u2019s fine. But the last sentence was truly unnecessary!What do you mean\u2026 \u2018weak\u2019!]Ning Bi-Luo was lost in his thoughts. He finally sighed and then spoke again, \u201cI understand\u2026 I understand why you want to recruit me\u2026 You are so weak at the moment, so you definitely need a man like me. It is indeed rather difficult to protect yourself in the capital during such a miserable time, since you are weak.\u201dYe Xiao spoke blandly, \u201cWhat a pity. You won\u2019t serve anybody.\u201dHe was a bit upset, [This guy\u2026 is truly not good at talking. He keeps mentioning something he shouldn\u2019t. I am weak indeed, but that\u2019s not his business. Does he really need to mention it again and again?]Ning Bi-Luo lowered his head and thought. After a while, he said, \u201cI am sorry. Even though you have saved me twice and that made me owe you two lives\u2026 When I think about bowing in front of others and waiting for orders\u2026 I feel terrible and frustrated. So\u2026\u201dYe Xiao understood him. He nodded. He had already thought about it.The reason why Ning Bi-Luo could become the No.1 assassin in the world is his pride. So Ye Xiao said, \u201cIn fact, you don\u2019t need to feel vexatious. I never want to force you into anything.\u201dNing Bi-Luo understood what it meant. If he hadn\u2019t followed Ye Xiao, he wouldn\u2019t need to be vexatious like this.He was suffering from his own actions, wasn\u2019t he?\u201cBut, how can I pay you back?\u201d Ning Bi-Luo asked embarrassedly.\u201cHeh heh. Have I ever mentioned anything\u2026 about paying me back?\u201d Ye Xiao smiled blandly, \u201cYou have your faith to insist. You have your path to walk on. And I have mine. We are the same kind. I understand you.\u201d\u201cSo, whatever you think you should do, just do it.\u201d Ye Xiao said peacefully, \u201cDon\u2019t care about anything between you and me. They are nothing but turns in life.\u201d\u201cBut I do care. How can I not?\u201d Ning Bi-Luo smiled bitterly.Ye Xiao was speechless.[Now you care. Yet you told me seriously that you won\u2019t serve me. What do you want?What the hell is wrong with this guy!]\u201cIs there anything I can do for you at the moment?\u201d Ning Bi-Luo seriously asked, \u201cI can do it for you in any case. I will talk about leaving after that. It can be anything!\u201d\u201cUnlucky for me. I don\u2019t have anything for you to do right now!\u201d Ye Xiao refused stoutly.He had his own pride too.[You don\u2019t want to serve anybody. I won\u2019t force anybody.You have your insistence. I have mine. We have the same quality!]\u201cCan\u2019t you just give me a chance to pay you back? Do you want me carry this heart of regret for the rest of my life!\u201d Ning Bi-Luo asked with frustration.\u201cHeh heh. It won\u2019t take long. There will be a chance.\u201d Ye Xiao spoke ambiguously, \u201cJust be patient. There will be a chance for you to pay me back soon.\u201dNing Bi-Luo sighed in mind.He understood Ye Xiao. He knew that even if there was a day that Ye Xiao would need his help, he was sure that Ye Xiao would never ask for it.And he didn\u2019t know when Ye Xiao would need his help in the future!Ning Bi-Luo was a proud man. The guy in front of him was young and a bit laddish, yet he was also an extremely proud guy. He knew that Ye Xiao was even prouder than himself!\u201cI want to rebuilt my assassination union.\u201d Ning Bi-Luo spoke in a low voice.\u201cOh.\u201d Ye Xiao had clean up himself and walked to his bed. He casually took off his shoes and then lied on the bed. He also put both his feet on the bed casually. He was a bit impolite anyway, as there was still a guest in the room.Yet Ning Bi-Luo understood that Ye Xiao acted this way because he didn\u2019t want to talk further. He knew that Ye Xiao was telling him to leave now.\u201cI want your advice, please.\u201d Ning Bi-Luo said.They both understood that Ning Bi-Luo was saying yes to his recruitment. Ning Bi-Luo was still a bit resisting this though.Yet he had no other choice, since Ye Xiao had saved him twice.[I will establish an assassination union for you as my return.]Ye Xiao spoke blandly, \u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate. I am not an assassin, so I don\u2019t have any advice. I think I should better keep silent in front of a specialist.\u201dNing Bi-Luo stood up and said, \u201cI have nothing to say.\u201dHe walked several steps and spoke again, \u201cI won\u2019t leave the capital for the next several days.\u201dYe Xiao spoke blandly, \u201cAs you wish. The world is so big and you are a free man.\u201dHe raised his head and spoke seriously, \u201cNing Bi-Luo, do not take what I do for you as an exchange of interests! We are men of the martial world. It is nothing but only fate\u2026 Why take it as a deed to heart?\u201dNing Bi-Luo was stunned and then he spoke embarrassedly, \u201cFine then. I am off now. I won\u2019t tell anybody about you. You have my word.\u201dYe Xiao spoke peacefully, \u201cI have never told you anything. Ning Bi-Luo, as a man in the martial world, you are a bit too calculative. You don\u2019t need to!\u201dNing Bi-Luo smiled embarrassedly and thought, [Come on man. I owe you my life twice. And you won\u2019t give me any chance to pay you back. How can I not be calculative? If I just ignore it, doesn\u2019t it make me a graceless and ungrateful man!]He walked by the window and then stopped. He spoke in a low voice, \u201cLord Ye, let\u2019s all step back a bit. I can serve you three years. In three years, I will follow your orders. After three years I become a free man. How about that?\u201dYe Xiao laughed, \u201cNo! I don\u2019t want it!\u201dAnd then he continued, \u201cIt is wet and rainy outside. Be safe\u2026 Don\u2019t forget to close my window when you leave, please.\u201dNing Bi-Luo was refused again.Three years was the limit of what he can do. Yet Ye Xiao refused it so stoutly. Ning Bi-Luo understood that Ye Xiao was too proud to accept it as he had refused Ye Xiao once.Ye Xiao would never accept this repayment.For Ning Bi-Luo, it was not charity; it was the biggest compromise he could make!He then sighed with frustration and left. As Ye Xiao wished, he closed the window gently.Ning Bi-Luo heard Ye Xiao spoke inside, \u201cNow you have done one thing for me, haven\u2019t you? From now on, you don\u2019t owe me anything. Go and feel relaxed. You are an assassin. I am from the General\u2019s House. We are in different sides. We have different paths. There is no need to care too much about each other.\u201dAnd then the light was off inside.Ning Bi-Luo was upset, [What I have done for him was only closing the window for him as he wished.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euCan it really be as important as saving my life twice?]\u20264th guaranteed chapter of the week.Translated by: RainEdited by: Alpha, ArchPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 100 \u2013 Tough Time For The SalesroomNing Bi-Luo realized that Ye Xiao was speaking naturally. There was no anger or displeasure in his voice. It was spoken in a peaceful context. Ning Bi-Luo knew that Ye Xiao truly didn\u2019t care about it.[You can be indifferent, but I\u2026 Can I?]Ning Bi-Luo stayed on the roof in the heavy rain for a long time. Eventually he sighed and flew away.Ye Xiao smiled in the dark and murmured, \u201cAs an assassin, he is cute\u2026 However, he underestimated me. If I am a man who always does favors for benefits, I won\u2019t risk my own life to save you, will I?\u201d\u201cBesides\u2026 If the No. 1 assassin becomes my servant\u2026 Then he will no longer be the No.1 assassin. He will even fail to be a assassin\u2026 The change of one\u2019s faith will lower one\u2019s strength\u2026\u201d\u201cSo I will never constrain you by asking you to repay the favor.\u201d\u201cHave a safe trip, my friend.\u201dYe Xiao fell asleep quickly.The past events had truly left him exhausted.\u2026The next day, in the Ling-Bao Hall Salesroom.Ling-Bao Hall had also been through a busy time these days.Since the big boss had arrived, the atmosphere had become tense in the Ling-Bao Hall. The whole place was full of anxiety.Especially Master Guan, Guan Wan-Shan. He was having a really difficult time.He had been looking forward for Feng Zhi-Ling\u2019s arrival.The big boss, the big fat guy Wan Zheng-Hao had badly lost his weight these days. That was an efficient way to lose weight. He was like a mad man walking round and round in the salesroom everyday.Hmm. Regarding his body type, it might be a bit inappropriate to describe it as \u2018walking round and round\u2019; \u2018rolling round and round\u2019 should be better\u2026Every time he saw Guan Wan-Shan, he would grab him and ask, \u201cDid Feng Zhi-Ling come? He is here, isn\u2019t he? No?\u201dIf he saw Guan Wan-Shan ten times in a day, then he will ask the questions about Feng Zhi-Ling at least twenty times.When he let Guan Wan-Shan go, he would add, \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t he come yet? When will he come?\u201dDuring their conversation, he will ask some other questions from time to time. That was why he will ask this one question \u2018at least\u2019 twenty times a day.\u201cHe couldn\u2019t be dead, could he?\u201d\u201cWhy is he still not coming\u2026 What\u2019s going with that bastard?\u201d\u201cWhy isn\u2019t he here yet? Do you know what happened to him? Did he die for some venereal disease or what?\u201d\u201cI think maybe I should send someone to check the brothel. What do you think?\u201d\u201cWhy is he not coming? You. Explain it to me\u2026\u201dIt truly brought Guan Wan-Shan a painful headache. He was nearly freaked out.It wasn\u2019t overstated. Everyone who had been asked the same questions dozens times a day would be freaked out. And his IQ would never stop being reduced\u2026Guan Wan-Shan thought that if the big boss kept asking him, he would go mad. [Feng Zhi Ling\u2026 He is not my son, is he? How can I possibly know that when he will come or why he doesn\u2019t come? You keep asking me. Who can I ask? Explain? What on earth can I explain? What clue do I have to explain? Explain your ass!But\u2026 I can not turn down my boss, can I?]Every time after he had humbly answered all these meaningless and repeated questions, he felt like he wanted to go mad. Maybe the next time, he would really go crazy\u2026As for now, when Guan Wan-Shan noticed the big boss, the only thing he wanted to do was to run away.However, the salesroom was not a spacious place after all. Even he wanted to escape, there was not many places that he could hide.He just couldn\u2019t escape the big boss, could he?Day after day, the big boss was getting more and more anxious. Instead of coming across Guan Wan-Shan, he ran to Guan Wan-Shan\u2019s room shouting in a hurry, \u201cHas he come? Any news? When will he come?\u201dWhen he failed to find Guan Wan-Shan, he asked everybody in the salesroom to look for Guan Wan-Shan, \u201cBring Master Guan to me now!\u201dSo sometimes Guan Wan-Shan was brought to the big boss.And then the big boss started his questions, \u201cHas he come? Any news? When will he come?\u201dGuan Wan-Shan was hearing the same vicious spells when he heard the questions. His face would turn pale and his eyes would become blank and straight. Sometimes he just wanted to die.He really wanted to shout out, [Damn it! You keep asking the same questions eight hundred times a day. Do you think it is funny?]However, he had thought of this words for eight million times and still couldn\u2019t dare to speak out.He was working under the big boss\u2019s place. He couldn\u2019t be so offensive. He had to answer the boss\u2019s questions in a proper way!In fact, the big boss, Wan Zheng-Hao was more upset himself.He was so upset that he nearly wanted to kill himself.He had made an awesome decision to store such a precious treasure. It was kept in his place for three thousand years. Yet he never had seen its true value. Every time when there was an auction, he desperately wanted it to be taken away.For three thousand years, nobody wanted it. Even when it was bought several times, it would be returned in a short while. He had been so upset about it, because he thought that it was a curse set to have him humiliated.In fact, it was this very treasure that brought him to today\u2019s glory. It was obviously a blessing to him. Why did he so desperately wanted to get rid of it?He was out of his mind\u2026 Wasn\u2019t he?Now, it was finally sold. Yet right after it was gone, he realized that it was a priceless superior treasure.That was truly, a huge tragedy.When he knew the truth, he almost hung himself right away.That was just a normal thing for him\u2026Everyone knew that the Ling-Bao Hall was inherited from generation to generation. No matter who became the big boss, he needed to change his name to Wan Zheng-Hao.That was the tradition of Ling-Bao Hall.However, only Wan Zheng-Hao himself knew the truth.All those heritors were actually the same guy\u2026 Wan Zheng-Hao himself. The inheriting matter was just a cover.Nobody knew about it.\u201cIt is lucky that nobody knows the truth. Otherwise I will be seriously disgraced this time\u2026 I have to get the Cosmic Hades back\u2026\u201d Wan Zheng-Hao was pacing around anxiously.[I may die if I don\u2019t get it back soon enough.There is a slayer that I should never mess with staring at me every day\u2026]In his room, the middle-aged man watched Wan Zheng-Hao pacing and spoke indifferently, \u201cIt won\u2019t do any help pacing around. Wan Zheng-Hao. You brilliant bastard. You had kept such a precious treasure for so many years and you actually never have told me anything.\u201dWan Zheng-Hao was sweating because of fear. His muscles were trembling as if dancing and he spoke weakly, \u201cI didn\u2019t know its value, did I\u2026 I thought it was just some garbage that kept bringing me disgrace\u2026 Ah. I was so blind\u2026\u201dThe middle-aged man sneered and said, \u201cI have made such great efforts to keep you alive. I have taught you the secret martial arts so that you can prolong your life. I have helped you make your Ling-Bao Hall the No. 1 salesroom in the whole land\u2026 Wan Zheng-Hao, and you pay me back with all this?\u201dWan Zheng-Hao was extremely frightened and said, \u201cPlease. Please\u2026 I didn\u2019t know the truth about the Cosmic Hades. It is true\u2026 If I knew it, I wouldn\u2019t put it in the auctions so many times, would I? I wouldn\u2019t sell it for only several millions silver bars, right? It was valuable only in the hand of the outstanding superior masters like you. Besides, if I knew that you would like it, I would just give it to you as a gift. If you just gave me a slight piece of favor, it would be more valuable than billions of gold in the mortal world\u2026 There is no way I could be so stupid\u2026\u201dThe middle-aged man frowned and thought, [That is true. He is talking reasonably indeed.It was just like a piece of dark gold being regarded as mud by a ignorant poor little rat\u2026 who didn\u2019t think it pretty and valuable, instead he think it had the same color with shit\u2026]\u201cAny news now?\u201d he then asked, \u201cThat guy\u2026 Feng Zhi-Ling?\u201dWan Zheng-Hao wanted to kill himself when he heard the question.Recently he had been asking Guan Wan-Shan the same question many times over, and actually he had been asked this same question by the middle-aged man for the same amount of times. What Guan Wan-Shan felt was exactly what he felt.Guan Wan-Shan was just freaked out being asked while Wan Zheng-Hao was being threatened\u2026 That were quite different things.\u201cNot at the moment.\u201d Wan Zheng-Hao was upset, because he knew what the middle-aged man would say next.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you have any information yet\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen will you have anything\u2026\u201d\u201cHow long do you want me to wait? Do you know how much time you have wasted me\u2026\u201dThese words had been said several hundred times these days. Wan Zheng-Hao could even recite them in reverse.\u2013 Bang! \u2013 Suddenly the door was opened. The next moment, the old man Guan Wan-Shan rushed in like a vigorous seven-teen years old guy yelling excitingly, \u201cThe\u2026 That\u2026 He\u2026 He has come!\u201dThe two men in the room were shocked at the same time.They kept their eyes wide opened staring at the old man who looked like he had taken aphrodisiac. They were stunned.The room they were staying was a place that nobody else was allowed to entered. Guan Wan-Shan was in a high position in the Ling-Bao Hall and he knew about this room, but usually he never dared to get in. What happened to him?Guan Wan-Shan shouted and then gasped. He was holding his knees. He was old after all. He got tired after being excited for a moment. His face was in red, not because he had moved tempestuously, because he was too excited.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu[Oh thank god!
