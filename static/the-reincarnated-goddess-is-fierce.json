Smoke was everywhere.Xia Xibei smiled bitterly before she even opened her eyes.\u2014She had failed again!2In the next moment, the weird sensations in her body made her open her eyes, her gaze looking sharp.The sloppy, dirty, and stinking man in front of her did not notice the change. Instead, he grinned and bared his yellow teeth while stroking her body.Xia Xibei\u2019s motions were faster than her thoughts. She grabbed the man\u2019s hand and pulled hard!\u201cOw!\u201dThe man yelped, and his scream scared all the feral dogs and cats who were scrounging for food in the trash cans nearby.\u201cLet\u2026let me go!\u201dThe man yelled as he tried to push Xia Xibei.But in the next moment, he screamed again as Xia Xibei kicked hard at his lower body, his eyes bulging out from the pain!5What kind of man wouldn\u2019t understand this kind of pain?4Xia Xibei didn\u2019t stop. She kicked him again, sending him to the wall.The man curled up. His face was so pale, and he couldn\u2019t speak.Xia Xibei looked around blankly. This familiar yet strange alley with its sour and pungent smell finally unlocked her long-forgotten memory.She looked down at her body in\u00a0t-shirt and jeans, and her expression finally changed.She was reborn again?! And she was reborn as a seventeen-year-old!Yes, she was reborn twice.1The first time, she was reborn in a mysterious fantasy world with her memories, eventually becoming a legendary doctor and a naturalist.However, she had never expected to be reborn a second time! And she had returned to her first life, a lifetime when she was the most unwilling and resentful!3Looking at the man groaning in pain, her eyes became colder.In this life, although she had parents, they had long ago divorced and made new families who regarded her as a burden and let her live by herself.6As a result, she had no choice but to work to support herself.During this point in time, she was working as a clerk for a small restaurant. She had gone out for a delivery and when she passed through this narrow alley, she was followed by this homeless man who had assaulted her.Even though she got away in the end, the encounter had traumatized her for life!Now that she was reborn, she would start her change with this man!She walked toward the man as she thought of this.\u201cNo, no\u2026 don\u2019t come over!\u201dWhen he heard her footsteps, the homeless man became afraid, and he started to beg. \u201cI-I\u2026 someone told me to come. I didn\u2019t want to!\u201dXia Xibei stopped walking. Her face was dark and inscrutable, her gaze cold. \u201cWho told you to come?\u201d\u201cA-a teenager! He gave me money, he told me to wait for you here! He told me to do all this!\u201dThe homeless man didn\u2019t dare to hide anything and immediately told her the whole story.He was afraid that if he talked too slow, Xia Xibei would kill him.A teenager?Xia Xibei looked down. \u201cHow much did he give you?\u201d\u201cJust one\u2026 one thousand yuan!\u201dOne thousand yuan was enough for him to ruin a girl. So cheap!Even though the last step wasn\u2019t committed, this incident was\u00a0already a huge blow to Xia Xibei, who was originally introverted and timid.This was also the start of her tragedy.Thinking of this, she stepped forward. \u201cWhere is the money?\u201dThe homeless man was startled and looked up at her in disbelief.\u201cTake it out!\u201dXia Xibei stomped a foot on his back with no mercy.\u201cI-I-I\u2019ll get it now!\u201dThe homeless man hurriedly pulled out a thousand yuan from his clothes.\u201cCan I go now? I\u2019m really innocent!\u201dPicking up the money that was still smelly, Xia Xibei showed a weird smile.Innocent? How innocent can someone be to ruin a girl for one thousand yuan?Her mouth moved. In the next instant, a few feral cats suddenly appeared and charged toward the homeless man.17\u201cArgh\u2014!\u201d1Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

People who had both skills were called naturalists.2It could be because of her memory that she had a strong mental power to become a rare naturalist.Even though her skills in this area were almost non-existent after being reborn, controlling a few feral cats and dogs was still really easy.Xia Xibei wasn\u2019t moved by the screams coming from behind her. She kept walking forward.However, as she passed another alley, a few footsteps came.\u201cGet him! He\u2019s in front! Don\u2019t let him get away!\u201dXia Xibei frowned. She didn\u2019t want to face these people, so she carefully darted away.As she got close to a raft of bamboo, the scent of blood rushed to her nose.Before she could react, a hand had pulled her into the raft of bamboo.\u201cShhh\u2026\u201dA low-pitched voice sounded, and before she could speak, he hugged her and covered her mouth.A masculine scent filled her nostrils along with the thick scent of blood.The footsteps outside got closer. They were headed toward them.Xia Xibei was angry, but she couldn\u2019t let those people get close to them. They might think she was with the man.Her brows moved.\u201cOver there!\u201dSomeone yelled, followed by others running in another direction.After making the feral cats and dogs lead the people away, Xia Xibei felt dizzy and her body went limp.She would have fallen on the ground if the man didn\u2019t catch her.However, their pose was a little suggestive.Xia Xibei was very thin, but she wasn\u2019t short. She was almost 170 cm.6The man, however, was taller. She could feel his energy over her head, giving her goosebumps. He was also quite strong, with a wide and solid chest.When Xia Xibei had been pulled in here earlier, she didn\u2019t struggle; she just tried to maintain some distance from him.Now, she was too weak to stand from her exertion. She could only lean on him. There was almost no space between them.Such an ambiguous posture was already embarrassing, but what made Xia Xibei ashamed and annoyed was that the man\u2019s body seemed to have changed!The air seemed to have frozen as the two of them leaned together.Confirming that those people had left, she pressed against the man\u2019s chest and pushed him away.\u201cHm!\u201dThe man grunted. There was more blood on his belly now.Pa pa pa!The bamboo raft fell to the ground, making a crisp sound and bringing up a lot of dust.Xia Xibei finally saw the man.He was at least 185 cm tall. He had a lean figure and angular features, slanted and strong brows, deep and sharp eyes, thin lips, and a frown that made him look like an emperor overlooking the world from his throne, exuding arrogance.Too bad the blood stains and the mess made his strength ridiculous.When Xia Xibei clearly saw the man\u2019s face, her gaze changed.Qiao Yanjue. People called him Master Jue!The Qiao family was renowned for its wealth in the country of Hua, and he was a mogul of the business world, which frightened people.Except, when she thought of Qiao Yanjue\u2019s relationship with a certain person, she wished that she could have made those people chasing him come back!Xia Xibei\u2019s gaze made Qiao Yanjue frown. He hesitated. \u201cYou know me?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know you.\u201d Xia Xibei\u2019s face was unchanged.Of course, Qiao Yanjue didn\u2019t believe her. He could tell that the young woman wasn\u2019t telling the truth.However, he had no time to ponder this as his injury became worse.His body shook. Xia Xibei didn\u2019t have time to think: she strode forward and supported him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You can go,\u201d Qiao Yanjue said with a pale face. There was actually a pitiful look on his typically strong face.Xia Xibei\u2019s face turned dark. Of course she wanted to leave.But seeing how Qiao Yanjue looked, and the blood which kept flowing, her thoughts were in a jumble. In the end, she turned serious and had him sit on the ground.Before Qiao Yanjue could even react, she had his jacket taken off and his top pulled up. He was was pressed to the ground.Maybe Qiao Yanjue didn\u2019t have any strength left or something that he just let her move him.The clothes were pulled apart, revealing his sculpted abdomen. The bullet marks on it were terrifying, and there was still bleeding.If this continued, within ten minutes, he would die from excessive blood loss.Xia Xibei did not react as she reached out her hand to press hard on the wound.What shocked Qiao Yanjue was that the bleeding really stopped!\u201cGot a knife and a lighter?\u201dQiao Yanjue was startled for a moment, \u201cI have them in my pocket.\u201dXia Xibei reached over into his pocket and quickly took out an army knife, a lighter, and a pack of cigarettes.1She threw the pack of cigarettes into the trash can with a bit of disgust and set the knife on fire.9\u201cTry to hold on.\u201dAfter handling the knife, she said with a cold face. Before Qiao Yanjue could react, the knife sank into his wound.\u201cAh!\u201d Qiao Yanjue immediately broke into a cold sweat. He gritted his teeth, his body suddenly tightening.Pain! Huge pain!Without anesthesia, and in such a crude environment, Qiao Yanjue felt that he was crazy. And this girl was crazy, too!8If it weren\u2019t for his masculine pride, he might have yelled.1Xia Xibei\u2019s movements were very neat. The bullet was not deep, so it was soon dug out.Then Xia Xibei briefly treated the wound. She tore his coat into strips with a knife, and bandaged him simply.2\u201cOK. You won\u2019t die.\u201d2Xia Xibei stood up with a calm expression, but her eyes showed some revulsion.Qiao Yanjue\u2019s face was pale. He wondered if he had offended this girl before. Why else would she have this attitude?But he had never been to this place before; how could she know him?Xia Xibei took the knife and lighter. \u201cThis is my reward for saving you. I will not see you in the future.\u201dThen she left without waiting for Qiao Yanjue to reply.Watching this scene, Qiao Yanjue became even more bewildered.After regaining his senses, an interested smile appeared at the corner of his mouth.This girl was quite interesting.15Not see him in the future? Impossible!After a few minutes, there was movement in the alley again, but this time it was Qiao Yanjue\u2019s people who had come over.\u201cMaster, please forgive us, we came too late!\u201d1Several bodyguards looked at Qiao Yanjue, who was lying on the ground, and their faces turned paler.Especially after looking at the \u201cbandage\u201d on his abdomen\u2014their heartbeats almost stopped.Qiao Yanjue didn\u2019t speak, and let them help him up from the ground.When he got into the car, he finally spoke. \u201cFind out everything.\u201d1His voice was even, but everyone was so terrified that their hairs stood upright.1\u201cYes!\u201dMeanwhile, treating Qiao Yanjue\u2019s appearance as an accident, Xia Xibei washed the blood from her hands and walked back to the small restaurant where she worked.Fortunately, she was wearing black clothes today, so the bloodstains on it were not easy to see and would not scare people.Back at the small restaurant, there was immediately some shouting. \u201cWhere did you go? Where is the food you were delivering?! The customer has called to complain!\u201dFacing the seemingly honest face, Xia Xibei curved the corner of her mouth. \u201cI quit.\u201d3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I didn\u2019t even ask you about the delivery! How dare you quit on me?!\u201d1Her boss was called Deng Zhiqiang. He was tall and sturdy and built like an iron pagoda. He had an honest appearance, but his gleaming eyes exposed his character.1At first, Xia Xibei called the police after getting away from the homeless man.But after the police had arrived, Deng Zhiqiang told the police that she must have been lying, that she was lazy and liked to hook up with others, and that she was a frivolous girl.This kind of testimony really damaged the police\u2019s perception of Xia Xibei, making them think that she had caused the incident. Then the police didn\u2019t pay much attention to the matter.Xia Xibei was stunned at that time. What kind of bad blood did she have with Deng Zhiqiang?After that, she wanted to quit her job, but he deducted months of her wages and wanted to beat her!How could a weak girl fight back? So she had no choice but to leave angrily.Then, after she finally made it in the entertainment industry after much hard work, he came out to slander her, saying that she was restless when she was working in his small restaurant.He had an honest-looking face, so his words were believable to many people. Who would know he was smearing her?Such negative information made her situation much worse at that time!Thinking of these things, Xia Xibei was already very reserved for not breaking his stupid head.\u201cI quit. Give me my salary.\u201d Xia Xibei blankly said.\u201cSalary?\u201d Deng Zhiqiang, who was cursing, froze for a moment and then laughed. \u201cYou dare to ask me for wages?! What did you do?!\u201d\u201cHaven\u2019t I worked enough?\u201dShe has been working here Monday to Friday nights, from 6 to 11 p.m., then all day on Saturday and Sunday. She has been doing almost all the work\u2026 washing and chopping vegetables, washing dishes, and doing deliveries.She did several jobs, so there were few helpers in the restaurant, but she was only getting paid 1,500 yuan a month.Even the 1,500 yuan had not been paid for months.\u201cWhat work have you done? You have been so lazy every day. I just allowed you to work part-time here out of kindness, and now you dare to ask me for money?!\u201d1Deng Zhiqiang\u2019s eyes widened, and his face was angry.At this time, the other helpers had left for their break, and there were no customers in the small restaurant. If there were any customers at the door, they fled at the sound inside.Xia Xibei\u2019s face darkened. \u201cAre you really not paying me?\u201d\u201cNo f-ing way!\u201d Deng Zhiqiang waved his hand, \u201cI should ask you for the money! And money for the delivery! Give me one hundred yuan!\u201dXia Xibei was so upset she smiled.She knew that Deng Zhiqiang was shameless, but she didn\u2019t know he was this shameless.Seeing her smile, Deng Zhiqiang suddenly stared.He has always known that Xia Xibei was pretty, but she had always lowered her head, with her bangs covering half of her face. Plus she bowed her back, coupled with her dull personality, she was not attractive at all.But today, her face was completely exposed. She was prettier than the female celebrities he had seen, and younger too!1Her smile made Deng Zhiqiang\u2019s heart twitch.\u201cAhem!\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cBut I\u2019m a kind man. Don\u2019t worry about giving back the money. I can take you to the movies.\u201dThen the hotel.1Xia Xibei saw through his unspoken intention, and her face turned completely dark.\u201cRelax, I will treat you very well\u2026 argh!\u201d1Before he finished talking, he had already screamed.4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She kicked him in the stomach, sending him flying and crashing into several chairs.Deng Zhiqiang was dumbfounded, but before he could react, he saw Xia Xibei advancing on him again. She grabbed him from the ground and punched him in the stomach.\u201cArgh\u2014!\u201dDeng Zhiqiang felt as if his internal organs were about to shatter, and he had cold sweat like torrential rain.His mind turned blank. When did Xia Xibei become so cruel?He was 180 cm tall and twice the size of Xia Xibei, but when he was in front of her, he didn\u2019t have the slightest strength to fight back!But what frightened him was Xia Xibei\u2019s expression for she had been so calm. It was as if what she was doing now has not affected her emotions at all.\u2014She really wanted to kill him!Deng Zhiqiang\u2019s hairs stood upright, and he quickly begged for mercy. \u201cI\u2019ll pay you! I\u2019ll give you the money! Stop hitting me!\u201dIn response, Xia Xibei punched him in the belly.\u201cArgh!\u201d\u201cSorry. Force of habit.\u201d3Xia Xibei shoved him aside with a completely insincere expression of apology.However, Deng Zhiqiang didn\u2019t dare say anything; he was dumbfounded.Who would have thought that this thin and weak girl could have such terrifying power!Was she pretending to be weak when she was being easily bullied in the past?Deng Zhiqiang got up from the ground, ran behind the counter, and took out a wad of money, amouting to 5,000 yuan.The 4,500 yuan was Xia Xibei\u2019s wages for the past three months, which he had deducted.Xia Xibei would have starved to death if she hadn\u2019t been able to take a meal here.Xia Xibei reached out her hand.Looking at Xia Xibei\u2019s soft hand, Deng Zhiqiang trembled. He wanted to keep five bills, but he passed her the whole wad of money in the end.Xia Xibei collected the money, then she went to the kitchen to take away her belongings.Not many things belonged to her, just a cup and a towel.Seeing a pot of meat cooking in the kitchen, a smile appeared on the corner of her mouth.After Xia Xibei left, Deng Zhiqiang breathed a sigh of relief, but in the next moment he became annoyed.He rubbed his aching chest, gritted his teeth, and showed a bitter expression.He was going to make the little bitch pay!He picked up the phone and called the police.Soon, the police arrived.\u201cOfficer, I was beaten!\u201dThe police officer looked him up and down then wondered, \u201cWhere were you hit?\u201d\u201cHere!\u201dDeng Zhiqiang pulled up his clothes, but no wound was visible.He was stunned. How could there be no sign of Xia Xibei\u2019s power just now?\u201cIt must be an internal injury!\u201d He confidently said.\u201cIf it is an internal injury, then you have to go get checked out,\u201d the police officer said.As soon as he finished talking, one of the police officers\u2019 phones rang. The police officer\u2019s face changed when he heard the words on the other end.\u201c\u2026Okay, I understand.\u201dAfter the police officer hung up the phone, Deng Zhiqiang was about to say something when the police officer spoke seriously, \u201cSomeone reported that you are using opium husks in your food!\u201d\u2018Opium husks?\u20192As soon as the words were said, Deng Zhiqiang\u2019s face suddenly changed. His face paled, and he stumbled over his words. \u201cNo, it\u2019s impossible! I\u2026we are all proper business people here!\u201dHowever, his reaction was so intense that the police could easily see the problem.\u201cWe\u2019ll let you know if it\u2019s true or not. However, if someone made a report, we have to verify things. It just so happens that we are here today, so let\u2019s start.\u201dDeng Zhiqiang\u2019s face was even paler.

He had installed a surveillance camera in the restaurant, but it only recorded the area by the cash register, so Xia Xibei didn\u2019t hesitate to hit him.If he wanted to go to the hospital to check for injuries, he would find out that he was fine!If he still insisted on making trouble by then, he would have no time because Xia Xibei had planned more things for him.Although Deng Zhiqiang was rotten and stingy, he was still very generous to his lovers.Moreover, he was tall and built, so he was quite attractive to some women.Xia Xibei had told these women\u2019s husbands about the affairs.After Deng Zhiqiang got out of prison, he would still have to deal with the anger of those people.By that point, she did not believe that Deng Zhiqiang would still have the energy to make things difficult for her.Back in the small, dark, and dilapidated house, Xia Xibei frowned.When she was seven years old, her parents divorced and had their own families, so she was left behind in this old house as if she were a burden.In the beginning, she and her grandma had lived here. When she was fourteen years old, her grandma passed away, then she started living here by herself.Her parents only gave her three hundred yuan a month, which had not changed.In this day and age, what could 300 yuan do? It cost at least eight yuan to eat fast food. If one got sick, it would be even more troublesome.Therefore, Xia Xibei could only go get a job.Sitting on the sofa, Xia Xibei wanted to slap herself.Why was she so stupid in the first place?Why did she have to carry everything herself?She was still a minor! She had been working hard here, but her parents were living leisurely, so why?After two lifetimes of precipitation, she no longer had any feelings for her parents.Even if there were, they were all wiped out because of what her parents did later on.In a year, this place was going to be demolished. Her father had come and had taken all the payment for the demolition of the house, leaving her with no place to stay.3She fought so hard to finally become a second-tier star a few years later, then her parents showed up to ask for money. If she refused, they would spread all kinds of rumors about her.Thinking of this, Xia Xibei\u2019s gaze became even colder.This time, she wouldn\u2019t be so stupid and let them bully her!Thinking of this, she picked up the phone and dialed one of the numbers that had been stored for a long time but was rarely used.After a while, there was an impatient male voice.\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you not to call me?\u2014Tingting, be careful! Dad will get you the water!\u201dThe voice had been very impatient at first, but then it became gentle. The difference between the two would make one feel emotional.But Xia Xibei had long since stopped being affected by these emotions.In a calm manner, she said, \u201cI want money. Give me two hundred thousand yuan.\u201d\u201cTwo hundred thousand yuan? Are you insane?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You might as well go out and rob it!\u201dXia Xibei\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201cI\u2019m not crazy. If you don\u2019t give me the money, I will go to your company to find you. By the way, I will figure out how much support you have owed me over the years.\u201dXia Shahai was furious and spoke in a loud voice. \u201cHow dare you?!\u201d\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I dare?\u201d Xia Xibei snorted. \u201cIf other people knew that you only give your daughter three hundred yuan a month in support and then went out to eat, drink, and have fun with your current wife and children\u2026 Who will it embarrass? I think you know the answer really well.\u201dThese words shocked Xia Shahai.If Xia Xibei really were to do this, it would certainly have some impact!If his business partners were to know this, they would either doubt his character or worry about his ability.As Xia Shahai was thinking about this, Xia Xibei\u2019s devious whispers had reached his ear, \u201cYou can\u2019t even support your own children. Wouldn\u2019t your business partners worry about your financial resources?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you dare?!\u201d\u201cIf I can\u2019t even live anymore, why wouldn\u2019t I dare? And I really want to see my dear brother and sister, which school are they in? Is it that\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201dXia Shahai was going to die of rage. Xia Xibei was usually mute and introverted, so why was she so sharp-tongued now?!What\u2019s even worse was how she was threatening him with his younger children!However, Xia Shahai\u2019s instinct was telling him that Xia Xibei wasn\u2019t lying! She would really do this!\u201cIn addition to the 200,000 yuan, I want the house I am living in now. You will transfer it to me.\u201d\u2018She wants the money and the house?!\u2019Xia Shahai was so angry that this damn girl dared to make more demands!\u201cTomorrow is Monday, I will take time off and wait for you. If you don\u2019t come, I will go and look for all of you. And maybe I will stay with you for a few days, we can work on improving our relationship.\u201dXia Shahai gritted his teeth, his face turning dark; but he could only nod in the end. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be over tomorrow!\u201dAfter talking, he angrily hung up.Xia Xibei looked at the phone she got hung up on and raised an eyebrow. She then dialed another number.\u201cWhy are you calling again? I am busy here\u2026\u201d On the other end, Dong Shulan sounded even more impatient than Xia Shahai.\u201cGive me 200,000 yuan.\u201dXia Xibei\u2019s words were like a pinch to her neck.\u201cTwo hundred thousand yuan?! Are you crazy?!\u201dDong Shulan\u2019s reaction was exactly the same as Xia Shahai\u2019s.Who would have thought that Xia Xibei, who was silent and introverted before, would make such a demand?She might as well rob the 200,000 yuan!\u201cIf you don\u2019t give me the money, I\u2019ll go find you at your school, and by the way, I will discuss with the police about the crime of child trafficking.\u201d6\u201cYou\u2026 how did you know?!\u201dDong Shulan\u2019s face was pale on the other end. She thought she was hallucinating.Otherwise, how could Xia Xibei have known about this?!\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about how I know. Since you have brought me back, then you have to take the responsibility. Give me 200,000 yuan, and then sign a relationship-severance letter. I will not go look for you in the future. Of course, don\u2019t try to find me either.\u201dDong Shulan looked at the phone; her mind was blank.\u201cTwo hundred thousand yuan. Transferred to my account tomorrow. Otherwise, I won\u2019t mind talking to your husband about what you have done. Anyway, I have a lot of free time.\u201dXia Xibei\u2019s \u201cextortion\u201d technique had leveled up after the first call.2\u201cFine!

And that little girl was even his own daughter!As he kept his eyes on Xia Xibei who was sitting on the sofa, he subconsciously dashed over, raised his hand high, and slammed it down on her!\u201cAhh!\u201dXia Xibei clasped her cheek and fell backward onto the sofa.\u201cGodda*n little girl, how dare you ask money from me?!\u201dXia Shahai furiously berated as he held back the urge to give another slap.\u201cAhh!\u201dHowever, he let out an agonized scream the next moment and staggered a few steps back, collapsing into another narrow sofa.He clutched at his own belly and stared at Xia Xibei in disbelief. \u201cHow dare you fight me back?!\u201d\u201cMister Xia, you have forgotten something.\u201d Xia Xibei stood up and dropped the hand that was covering her cheek. There wasn\u2019t the slightest mark on her face.She was looking down at him from above, with an indifferent look in her eyes. \u201cIf I had the courage to call you and ask for money, I sure enough wasn\u2019t afraid that you\u2019d raise a hand to me.\u201dShe went on, \u201cIf you remain adamant, I have no choice but to hand the evidence over to the police. I\u2019d like to know, the manager of a traded company who had abandoned his own child and even beat up his abandoned daughter\u2026 I suppose the reporters would be intrigued to know about such incidents.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026 what do you mean?\u201dXia Shahai looked at her in apprehension.Xia Xibei responded by getting hold of her phone from the side and clicking the start of the video that was just recorded. She turned the screen to him.As he watched his own ferocious self and the slap he gave, Xia Shahai\u2019s face turned ashen.1He was tricked!Besides, the phone held in Xia Xibei\u2019s hand was the new product of a well-known brand, which cost at least 5,000 yuan!From where did she get the money?!That wasn\u2019t the point, of course; the point was, Xia Xibei had gotten the whole incident recorded. If it were made public, it would be a big shame on him!\u201cGive me your phone!\u201dXia Shahai stood up and darted toward her. However, he was kicked back onto the sofa midway.He stared at Xia Xibei in total disbelief. Since when had she acquired such intrepid power?A malicious smile appeared on Xia Xibei\u2019s gorgeous face. \u201cMister Xia, do you still think I\u2019m still the little girl who let herself be bullied and never fought back?\u201dXia Shahai wanted a son, but she was a daughter, so it was a norm for her to get scolded and beaten.Xia Shahai couldn\u2019t help but shudder, Xia Xibei\u2019s reaction was terrifying!\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid that I will reveal what happened to you to the public?!\u201d Xia Shahai shouted, seeming stern but weak inside.\u201cJust do it,\u201d Xia Xibei shrugged. \u201cBut whose words do you think are more convincing? If I upload this video, and go to the reporters and the police to lodge a tearful complaint\u2026 I suppose you can imagine the outcome. All I\u2019m asking for right now are the 200,000 yuan that I deserve and this tiny house, is that too much?\u201dAs he watched Xia Xibei speaking the intimidating words with a calm look on her face, Xia Shahai felt his blood run cold.He thought\u2026 Xia Xibei must have been possessed!1However, even if that was true, he had no other way out!Eventually, he gritted his teeth. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll give it to you!\u201dXia Xibei finally beamed cheerfully. \u201cThat\u2019s the right way. That way, we don\u2019t have to waste any time.\u201d1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With the help of his extensive network of connections, the house was transferred under Xia Xibei\u2019s ownership very quickly.After the matter with the house was settled, Xia Xibei displayed an agreement entitled \u201cRepudiation of Relations\u201d.\u201cAfter signing this, whatever debt and owing between us will be cleared.\u201dAlthough this agreement might not have any legal effect, it was better than nothing.As far as Xia Xibei was concerned at least, this agreement could be used to prevent untoward circumstances that might happen in the future.Xia Shahai looked at the agreement. His face had turned so dark that water was about to drip from it.However, having thought of Xia Xibei\u2019s change, he gritted his teeth eventually. \u201cAfter I sign this, you won\u2019t look for me again?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Xia Xibei flashed a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll live very well on my own. I just hope that when I become rich someday, you won\u2019t come to me and ask for money.\u201dXia Shahai\u2019s face turned even darker.From where came her confidence to even think of getting rich someday?Even if she did become rich, would he go broke then?\u201cI hope you live up to your words!\u201dAfter signing the agreement, Xia Shahai strode away in rage.However, he did heave a sigh of relief. From then on, he could break free from the daughter he never liked.Although she was good-looking, no child that got out of his control was ever a good child!After resolving the matter with Xia Shahai, it was Dong Shulan\u2019s turn.Dong Shulan was far less violent than Xia Shahai. Besides, she was afraid of being exposed about what she did back then.Everyone knew that Xia Xibei was the child she had with Xia Shahai.If she hadn\u2019t been pregnant with Xia Xibei, Xia Shahai wouldn\u2019t have married her.1Even after getting divorced from Xia Shahai, this saying remained unchanged.If others were to know that she was a kid that she had bought, it would give rise to loads of troubles.Therefore, she did just as Xia Xibei instructed.Nonetheless, her heart ached when she gave her money away.That was 200,000 yuan! That was a great half of the money she secretly saved up all these years!Even though her husband was rich, she wouldn\u2019t normally receive a lot of money. Now that she was giving it all away in one shot, she felt all her internal organs aching at once.Xia Xibei couldn\u2019t even be bothered about her reaction. Upon receiving the money, she displayed the agreement.\u201cAfter this is signed, are you not going to\u2026\u201d\u201cRest assured, all love will be lost between us right after this.\u201dDong Shulan furrowed her brows.Although this was the outcome that she had wanted, it was too ruthless and cold of Xia Xibei to do this!2They had raised her for so many years no matter what, yet she was threatening them like that now! What an ungrateful monster!2However, from Xia Xibei\u2019s perspective, she had returned all that she owed them in the first life.If she hadn\u2019t considered the fact that they brought her up all these years, she wouldn\u2019t be this merciful to them.\u201cAlright, best wishes to you.\u201d Xia Xibei kept the agreement and flashed a bright smile at Dong Shulan.Looking at her beautiful smile, Dong Shulan had mixed feelings.However, Dong Shulan was relieved that the burden was finally removed and that they would never have to cross paths again. She left without turning back, her footsteps light and brisk.Having noticed that Dong Shulan had the same response as Xia Shahai, Xia Xibei sneered coldly inside.The next moment, her face beamed with joy as the thought of receiving 400,000 yuan at once occurred to her.2However, that was only her starting capital.Four hundred thousand yuan seemed like quite a big sum of money, but to some people out there, it was only the amount of their monthly pocket money.The disparity was kind of harsh.However, Xia Xibei wasn\u2019t worried. She would earn a lot more money in the years to come!After tying up the loose ends, she got a cozy sleep. The next morning, she returned to Qing Ye High School where she was studying.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Class three of 11th grade.The morning study period had not officially started. Everyone was chatting, and the class was very noisy.Suddenly, the class fell silent, and everyone turned their heads to look at the door.A slender figure walked in the door.After seeing the girl clearly, everyone couldn\u2019t resist staring.Some boys couldn\u2019t help but whistle.\u201cA new transfer student?\u201d\u201cWow, she\u2019s a beauty!\u201dBut some girls recognized the identity of the person.\u201cXia Xibei?\u201d\u201cNo way! She can\u2019t be!\u201dEveryone looked at Xia Xibei in surprise as she was coming in, showing expressions of astonishment.\u2018\u2014This is Xia Xibei?!\u2019The old Xia Xibei had long bangs and always liked to lower her head. She didn\u2019t dare to show her face, and her personality was a bit gloomy.Her body looked thin and weak, and everyone felt that she was malnourished.Moreover, she always liked to wear loose-fitting clothes. From a distance, she looked like a walking cloth sack.Coupled with her reticence, not many people liked to be close to her.1But today, her bangs, which almost covered her eyes, were clipped, revealing her delicate pale face.Her hair, which was usually scattered, was tied into a ponytail, making her look full of youth and vitality.Everyone realized that she was actually really beautiful!Big eyes, straight nose, pink mouth, fair skin\u2026 What a perfect beauty!Moreover, her clothes today fit very well. They were no longer the loose school uniform, but simple jeans and a T-shirt, showing off her long, straight, and slender legs.Everyone discovered that she has amazing body proportions!While she was only 170 cm, she gave people the illusion that she was 180 cm and that she was all legs below the neck!6Most importantly, the gloominess on her face was all gone!After confirming her identity, everyone was shocked!Did she get plastic surgery!?But plastic surgery would not change your personality after just a few days!Xia Xibei elegantly walked to her seat with pride under everyone\u2019s impressed gaze without being disturbed.Sharing her desk was a thin boy named Tang Luo.Tang Luo was about as tall as her. He had a dull personality, but he treated her well. He had at least helped her when other people bullied her.Otherwise, Xia Xibei\u2019s life here would have been more difficult.Tang Luo looked at the new Xia Xibei, and he was also very surprised. It made him talk, which was rare, \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d\u201cNothing. I just figured out something.\u201dXia Xibei showed him a bright smile; it was intoxicating like a rainbow after the rain.\u201cAs long as you figured it out.\u201d Tang Luo was startled, then he nodded and looked down at his book again.\u201cThank you.\u201d Xia Xibei smiled sweetly at him, mesmerizing the boys next to him.This scene caused several girls nearby to grind their teeth so hard they could have been crushed.One of the girls had mean eyes, and she gazed at Xia Xibei with envy and hatred.1She then took out her phone and sent out a few messages.After putting away her phone, a sullen smile appeared on her face.Her phone vibrated while she was taking out her book.She took out her phone and smiled sarcastically when she saw the name on it.Her smile turned colder when she saw the message.She hadn\u2019t even gone to find him, and he was already coming here. Fantastic!Tang Luo could see Xia Xibei out of the corner of his eye, and he was amazed. She was really different today!Xia Xibei sent a message.\u201cLet\u2019s break up.\u201d1As soon as the end-of-class bell sounded, a male student showed up at the door, his face looking angry.\u201cXia Xibei, get your ass out here!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have chosen her as his girlfriend.It was a pity that she was always dressed in old-fashioned outfits, which did nothing but embarrass him. Besides, due to some special reasons, he had never taken her out before.If it weren\u2019t for the fact that she wanted to break up with him, he would never have turned up here.Unexpectedly, she showed up like a whole different person today.\u201cI\u2026\u201dBefore Yang Xuan could finish his words, he was cut off by Xia Xibei.\u201cLet us talk over there.\u201dAs she finished, she took the lead and walked away before him.This made Yang Xuan\u2019s face fall.Was he being too nice to her? Her arrogance was sky-high now!Nonetheless, he still caught up with her.The crowd at the back stared at their backs in shock. They couldn\u2019t help but start gossiping away\u2026 Xia Xibei and that Yang Xuan were related? They hadn\u2019t noticed it before!Yang Xuan followed Xia Xibei to a remote and quiet corner.This was a blind spot of the security surveillance, some students chose to resolve their issues here.\u201cXia Xibei, stop right there!\u201dYang Xuan was enraged. He stepped forth in wide strides and reached out to grab Xia Xibei\u2019s shoulder.However, with a swift movement of her feet, Xia Xibei dodged his hand and flashed a sarcastic smile at him.\u201cDid you come to pay my money back?\u201dYang Xuan froze as she said those words.\u201cWhat, what money? What nonsense are you talking about!\u201dXia Xibei\u2019s smile turned even more sarcastic. \u201cYou told me that your father was in trouble, so I lent you 3,000 yuan. Later, you said that you wanted to purchase materials, I lent you another 2,000\u2026 Summing up all of those, you owe me at least 10,000 yuan. When are you paying me back?\u201d6\u201cXia Xibei!\u201dYang Xuan\u2019s face instantly turned red, and he grew even more furious. \u201cWhen did I ever borrow money from you? Don\u2019t you speak carelessly!\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d Yang Xuan quickly regained his composure. \u201cYou gave me the money yourself, I did not borrow it from you!\u201dSuch shameless remarks made Xia Xibei laugh.\u201cI can\u2019t even manage to feed myself, yet I gave you money? Am I stupid or what?\u201dOf course, Xia Xibei was indeed foolish back then. She could barely make ends meet, and yet she generously provided financial support to Yang Xuan.1They had not been together for more than half a year, and Yang Xuan had taken 10,000 yuan from her.It might not be a big amount to others, but as far as Xia Xibei was concerned, 10,000 yuan were all the savings she had!Yang Xuan was also shameless. He knew that Xia Xibei had to make money by working for people, yet he played the victim and asked money from her without any sense of guilt.If it was only a matter of money, she might just as well forget it and pretend that the money had been dropped in water.However, what Xia Xibei could not tolerate was that, not only did he take her money, he even ruined her!Back then, she thought that it was her that had provoked the homeless man. However, a few years later, she found out that it had been arranged by Yang Xuan!The reason he did that was to teach her a lesson!Xia Xibei was reluctant to put herself in his hands, so he resorted to such means to make her understand a fact: now that she had been tainted, it was her blessing that he still wanted to be with her!1Listen, what a ridiculous justification!That wasn\u2019t even all to it. After that, he intended to give Xia Xibei away as a present!If Xia Xibei hadn\u2019t been alert and ran away in time, she would have ended up with an even more tragic fate!Several years later, here he was in Xia Xibei\u2019s life again, inflicting even more misery upon her!As she thought of it, Xia Xibei\u2019s eyes turned icy cold. \u201cIf you do not return my money\u2026\u201d\u201cReturn what money!\u201d Yang Xuan said in a raised voice with his head held high, \u201cIt was you who gave me the money!

You really cheated on me! Say it! Who is that man?! I was wondering why you look different today, it turned out that you\u2019re hooking up with another man!\u201dHe looked Xia Xibei up and down with a measuring glance, and his rage intensified.No man would love being cheated on, let alone Yang Xuan, who was having other schemes up his sleeve.\u201cIf I\u2019d known you were this promiscuous, I would have slept with you already. Why bother acting all demure and innocent in front of me\u2026 Ahh!\u201dBefore he could finish his vulgar and foul remarks, he was cut off by a sweep of Xia Xibei\u2019s leg.He clutched his belly and staggered a few steps back. There was a surge of turbulence in his stomach, and he was gasping for breath.It wasn\u2019t over after she had launched the kick. Xia Xibei moved forward again and grasped him, and then she hurled him over her shoulder!With a bang, dirt and dust were sent flying from the ground.\u201cAhh!\u201dYang Xuan screamed with greater horror this time. He felt the sky and the earth spinning before his eyes even before his back hit the ground, which almost broke his bones.Xia Xibei\u2019s foot landed on his chest as she stared down at him from above. \u201cMy apologies, but I\u2019m way too busy to waste my time on you. As for our so-called relationship, we both know what\u2019s really going on. If you refuse to pay me back, that\u2019s alright.\u201dShe flashed him a bright smile. \u201cLet us wait and see what\u2019s gonna happen.\u201dRight as she finished speaking, the bell began ringing.Xia Xibei snapped her fingers. \u201cAiya, the class is starting! I have to go.\u201dThen she took off, just like that.Lying on the ground after many failed attempts of getting up, Yang Xuan was full of terror and bafflement. Was that really Xia Xibei? How could she be totally different from before!In fact, Yang Xuan wasn\u2019t really concerned about her threat.He was infuriated by Xia Xibei\u2019s attitude toward him!It seemed that she really had won someone else\u2019s favor, otherwise she wouldn\u2019t treat him so ruthlessly.Da*n it, he wouldn\u2019t simply drop the matter!Xia Xibei couldn\u2019t care less about Yang Xuan\u2019s thoughts, so she returned to the class very soon.There were a few more minutes before the class began, and the teacher was yet to arrive.A girl scurried to her side when she saw her returning.\u201cXibei, why did Yang Xuan look for you? Was he planning to make your relationship public?\u201dThe girl had a tinge of hatred in her eyes when she spoke those words, but she was smiling, looking all lovely and innocent.She was good-looking, but compared to Xia Xibei, she looked way too bland and boring.As they stood next to each other, the difference was as if between a young lady and her servant.Jin Yazhen knew the fact well; that was why she had so much resentment.\u201cWhat relationship?\u201d The other girls immediately gathered around them upon hearing the conversation. These nosy girls.\u201cYou and Yang Xuan are in a relationship?\u201d\u201cI knew it! You guys looked really weird. Sure enough, there\u2019s something fishy going on!\u201dSome were bitter and jealous. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say at the moment! How would Yang Xuan even fall for Xia Xibei?\u201dYang Xuan was indeed obnoxious, but he was fairly good-looking and popular in school, winning the favor of many girls.If Xia Xibei hadn\u2019t revealed her attractive side today, those people would have made even more insulting remarks!Putting all that aside, hardly anyone could rival Xia Xibei in looks\u2014not even the face of the school from the neighboring class, Xia Qinghan.1\u201cI didn\u2019t know that though, when were we ever in a relationship?\u201d Xia Xibei flashed a sarcastic smile at Jin Yazhen.\u201cBut earlier on, you said that you and him got together!\u201d Jin Yazhen\u2019s voice was loud, which captured the attention of more people. \u201cDid you two break up?\u201d1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Yang Xuan treats you well, you shouldn\u2019t let him down!\u201dAs the people pondered on it, they were taken aback right away.There was a great deal of information in those words!Xia Xibei had cheated on her boyfriend with a man of complicated background\u2026 Didn\u2019t that mean she was someone\u2019s mistress?!The students, who were yet to step into the outside world, wore a disgusted look on their faces.1.It had occurred to them as something revolting, as innocent as they could be.Xia Xibei looked at Jin Yazhen with the shadow of a smile.She would definitely have been victimized by Jin Yazhen\u2019s accusation and be rendered speechless if she were herself from her previous life. She had been too silly, hadn\u2019t she?But if she got swindled again this time, that would be very stupid of her indeed!\u201cZhenzhen, how could you say that? When did I ever get in touch with people of complicated backgrounds? Don\u2019t you speak recklessly!\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t the man look for you often back then? I think I saw him giving you money\u2026 Ahh! I shouldn\u2019t have spilled that!\u201dAs she spoke, she even put a hand over a mouth, looking as if she had made inappropriate remarks.The rest of them drew in a sharp breath. She really did become a mistress!The disgust in their eyes grew more intense when they looked at Xia Xibei.Xia Xibei chuckled all of a sudden. \u201cOh~ I think you must be talking about the owner of the restaurant where I work, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cHow would I know who he is\u2026\u201d\u201cHow could you not know?\u201d Xia Xibei interrupted her in shock. \u201cYou have been to the restaurant where I work, and you have seen the owner!\u201dBefore Jin Yazhen could answer, she went on, \u201cBut it\u2019s understandable, you were busy showing your affection toward Yang Xuan back then, and you couldn\u2019t care less about anyone and anything else, that\u2019s why you don\u2019t remember him.\u201dJin Yazhen was stunned for a moment. Before she could argue about \u201cshowing affection\u201d, Xia Xibei put on a serious look. \u201cBut rest assured, I won\u2019t be seeing him anymore.\u201d\u201cWhy is that?\u201d Jin Yazhen subliminally asked.\u201cBecause he was caught!\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d Jin Yazhen was dumbfounded. \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cHe put opium husks in meat, and that is an illegal act! Someone reported him, and he\u2019s in jail now.\u201dJin Yazhen inhaled a sharp cold breath. \u201cOpium husks?!\u201dThey were in high school; sure enough, they knew what those things were. Everyone was frightened.\u201cYeah, the meat that you always consume, there are lots of opium husks placed in it. I heard that it gets you addicted!\u201d Xia Xibei explained in a serious manner.\u201cAddicted?!\u201d Jin Yazhen\u2019s face turned pale.\u201cYes, it\u2019s better for you and Yang Xuan to get a check-up. I\u2019m not sure if it poses harm to your health.\u201d Xia Xibei put on a look of concern, and then it turned into a smug one. \u201cLuckily, I got the salary which he owed me for three months before he was caught, or I would have to feed on soil now!\u201dThe rest of the people couldn\u2019t help but be curious. \u201cYou worked there for a long time, didn\u2019t you consume the meat they sold?\u201d\u201cForget it!\u201d Xia Xibei ruefully shook her head. \u201cThe owner was super stingy! As workers, we only got to eat vegetables and bean curds, meat was a luxury that we couldn\u2019t afford!\u201dShe looked toward Jin Yazhen again. \u201cZhenzhen, I have treated you and Yang Xuan like what\u2014fifty or sixty meals? Each and every meal consisted of those meats. I think it is best for the two of you to get a check-up.\u201dAs she finished, the bell rang. The teacher happened to walk in at that time, and the crowd dispersed.Jin Yazhen had a very awful look on her face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Who was actually speaking the truth?However, judging from Xia Xibei\u2019s and Jin Yazhen\u2019s reactions, they tended to believe more in what Xia Xibei had said.Xia Xibei used to be introverted and timid in the past, and no one had ever seen her with Yang Xuan. Wasn\u2019t it funny to call them a couple out of nowhere?Besides, all that Xia Xibei had eaten, worn, and used were visibly wretched. Apart from her sudden change of appearance today, the rest of her remained the same.If she had hooked up with someone rich, she wouldn\u2019t be wearing clothes and shoes that cost no more than 200 dollars altogether, would she?5Looking at Jin Yazhen, on the other hand, she had a pale look on her face and a restless, uneasy look in her eyes\u2026 Something surely wasn\u2019t right with her!While the teacher was writing on the board, the students started passing notes as if they had gone insane. The love and hate between the three of them began escalating.It was a huge gossip!Seeing all the great commotion around him, Tang Luo couldn\u2019t help but shoot a glance at Xia Xibei.He heard what Xia Xibei said too, and he was amazed by her change as well.Back then, she would never have retaliated like how she just did.In pleasant words, Xia Xibei used to be gentle and introverted. In honest words, however, she was timid and foolish!However, she was a changed person today!Most of all, after saying those words, she had her focus on the book right now?!While everyone else was caught up in the agitation, Xia Xibei remained totally unruffled. She was reading the book with her head down.In the past, she started working right after finishing high school because of a series of incidents that had happened to her.In fact, even if she got accepted by any college, she would never have made it anyway because her parents wouldn\u2019t provide her school fees.Besides, her results were far from excellent because she had always been caught up with work. She had a long way to go if she were to get into a good college.After making her way into the entertainment industry, her high school results became a shortcoming of hers, which brought about a great deal of mocking and ridicules to her.Especially when put in comparison with other female celebrities, she would receive dozens of negative comments.No matter how successful she became later, this would always be a regret to her.Therefore, she was determined to get into a top-notch college in this lifetime!Not for anyone else but for herself!It was a joyous thing that her memory was so much better than before. Even though she hadn\u2019t been in touch with these contents for a long period of time, it only took her a glance or two to re-activate her memory. The things that she once found complex and abstruse seemed so much simpler now.If she continued this way, she would most likely get impressive results for this monthly assessment.As for Jin Yazhen who was sitting on tenterhooks, she did not grasp a single thing taught in the class.It was finally recess. The second the teacher stepped out of the class, she dashed over to Xia Xibei.\u201cXibei, you\u2019re mistaken, Yang Xuan and I are not a couple, you and him are\u2026\u201dBefore she could finish, Xia Xibei cut her off, \u201cHow could you not be? If you aren\u2019t with him, why would you become his guarantor when he borrowed money from me?\u201d\u201cBorrowed money? Guarantor?\u201dEveryone pricked their ears to listen in. It was a massive gossip!Jin Yazhen was rattled. \u201cI did not become his guarantor, and he\u2026 he did not borrow any money!\u201d\u201cJin Yazhen, are you two trying to evade your debt?\u201d Xia Xibei\u2019s face finally turned glum.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Your words were promising back then, but now you\u2019re going back on your word, saying that you haven\u2019t borrowed any money from me? What about the 20,000 yuan I lent you then, was it fake or something?\u201d5Xia Xibei\u2019s allegation made their on-looking classmates draw in sharp breaths. \u201cTwenty thousand yuan?!\u201dAlthough many of them came from well-off families and were given quite a lot of pocket money, 20,000 yuan was still a big sum to them!They did not expect Jin Yazhen to have lent so much money for Yang Xuan, and right now, she even denied having done that. That was so shameless of her!\u201cYou know my family\u2019s living conditions. My parents had left me on my own device, and all I have is a few hundred yuan every month, I have to go out there and work in order to feed myself. All I receive in return for a month of hard work is 1,500 yuan. I won\u2019t even spend it on my meals, yet I bought meat for you guys\u2026 These 20,000 yuan was my hard-earned money, I was saving them for college!\u201d1There were tears gleaming in Xia Xibei\u2019s eyes.1The rest of the crowd were instantly infuriated by the injustice.\u201cJin Yazhen, you shouldn\u2019t have done that! It is absolutely indisputable to return the money you borrowed! You can\u2019t be that unreasonable as a person!\u201d\u201cI agree! Xia Xibei worked so hard to earn a living, do you think she was doing that to feed the two of you instead?\u201dAlthough they didn\u2019t like Xia Xibei, they weren\u2019t fond of Jin Yazhen either. It was Jin Yazhen\u2019s fault that she was always flirting with boys.Besides, the matter ignited sparks of justice within them.They knew Xia Xibei\u2019s life hadn\u2019t been easy back then, but they didn\u2019t know it was that difficult!And in the midst of her difficulty, someone refused to return the money they owed her. How obnoxious!Being chastened by everyone, Jin Yazhen got anxious. Hurriedly, she argued, \u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about, Xibei! Yang Xuan was your boyfriend. Even if he borrowed money from you, it was only because you were willing to lend it!\u201dJin Yazhen really was wronged. She had never agreed to be a guarantor to Yang Xuan.At most, all she had ever done was make a few positive remarks about Yang Xuan in front of Xia Xibei; there was no way she would become his guarantor.Even though she knew that Yang Xuan had borrowed quite a lot of money from Xia Xibei, she didn\u2019t know that he had borrowed this much! Didn\u2019t he tell her it was only a few thousand dollars?1\u201cWhat boyfriend!\u201d Xia Xibei\u2019s voice turned very cold. \u201cJin Yazhen, I\u2019m finally seeing right through you today!\u201dShe kept a straight face. \u201cDid anyone ever see us holding hands? Who here has seen me with Yang Xuan before?\u201dEveryone shook their heads at that.They had never seen Xia Xibei with Yang Xuan, indeed.\u201cI\u2019ve seen Yang Xuan and Jin Yazhen shopping together though; they seemed intimate,\u201d someone said.Jin Yazhen grew even more flustered.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing between Yang Xuan and I! At most, we share the relationship of a loaner and a debtor!\u201d Xia Xibei\u2019s voice was loud and clear, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m being suspicious. Jin Yazhen, what do you mean by insisting that Yang Xuan and I are a couple?\u201d\u201cIf the two of you were a couple, then Yang Xuan wouldn\u2019t have to return you the money he borrowed!\u201d Someone shouted.\u201cRight! That is it!\u201dThe rest of them nodded in agreement.They were all still self-aware at this stage. As far as they were concerned, the money spent when a couple had gone out together wasn\u2019t supposed to be asked back.\u201cSo that is it!\u201d Xia Xibei cast a deep, gloomy look at Jin Yazhen. \u201cThat explains why you tried so hard to defame me, by calling Yang Xuan and I a couple. That\u2019s what you were thinking all along, right?\u201d\u201cMore than that!\u201d Tang Luo chipped in suddenly, \u201cJin Yazhen even said that you cheated just now. In that case, you would be the one at fault.

You willingly became Yang Xuan\u2019s guarantor, claiming that he was in an urgent need of money, I only lent it to him for your sake. But I never thought that you guys would defame me in such a way, and you even denied having borrowed my money!\u201d\u201cJin Yazhen, that\u2019s not how a good friend should behave,\u201d Tang Luo added.4The others nodded in unison.If that was how a good friend should act, then they would rather live without friends!\u201cYou worked so hard and ate simple meals, yet you bought them good food\u2026 Tsk tsk.\u201dTang Luo\u2019s words made the rest of them sympathize with Xia Xibei even more.\u201cLook at how Jin Yazhen and Yang Xuan dress themselves up and what they eat, they don\u2019t seem to lack any money!\u201d\u201cThey eat much better than I do, okay? They have seafood and meat for every meal, I don\u2019t even get to have those!\u201d Someone said.\u201cThey couldn\u2019t be spending Xia Xibei\u2019s money, could they?\u201dThe heated discussion made Jin Yazhen\u2019s face turn paper pale, looking flurried and nervous.\u201cI did not! I never borrowed any money from Xia Xibei! Yang Xuan is wholly responsible for that! Neither are the two of us a couple! It\u2019s Xia Xibei and Yang Xuan that are together!\u201dHowever, not a single soul believed Jin Yazhen\u2019s words.\u201cXia Xibei never had any interaction with Yang Xuan, okay? Let alone being in a relationship with him!\u201d\u201cRight! Do you think we are all fools here?\u201d\u201cJin Yazhen, it is only right and proper to return the money you owe,\u201d Tang Luo concluded.\u201cJin Yazhen, I\u2019m begging, could you two please do me a favor and return me the 20,000 yuan?\u201dXia Xibei was at the brink of tears.\u201cI\u2026\u201dJin Yazhen was rendered speechless. The reproachful looks from the people were driving her insane.At that moment, the bell rang and the teacher walked in. The crowd had no choice but to disperse.However, before they were dismissed, they shot sarcastic and contemptuous glances at her.Jin Yazhen returned to her seat with cold limbs as chaos raged in her brain.The students started passing notes around once again. Jin Yazhen and Yang Xuan\u2019s matter was spreading like wildfire among the class.Xia Xibei sat in her seat, looking completely at ease. There was not a single hint of sadness on her face at all.A note was passed to her. \u201cDid they really borrow 20,000 yuan from you?\u201dXia Xibei cast a look at Tang Luo and wrote down the answer.\u2018\u2014\u2014Of course they did.\u2019Sure enough, Yang Xuan didn\u2019t borrow so much money from her, it was at most 10,000 yuan or so altogether.The remaining 10,000 yuan was compensation for the emotional trauma she had been through.6She only asked for 10,000 yuan, which was a fair and reasonable price.With her current net worth, it wouldn\u2019t even be bold of her to ask for ten million.However, if she asked for too much money, others wouldn\u2019t believe her either. They all knew she was broke, didn\u2019t they?Tang Luo shot her a look and did not say a word, but there was a hint of smile in his eyes.Jin Yazhen restlessly waited until dismissal. She wanted to look for Xia Xibei to explain things, but Xia Xibei, who wasn\u2019t even willing to bother with her, ran off to the washroom instead.When Xia Xibei emerged from the washroom, several girls stopped her in her tracks.\u201cSo you are Xia Xibei?\u201d1The girl in the lead questioned in a low, deep voice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They were all tall and robust, which made them look like the Four Great Guardian Warriors.Upon taking a close look at Xia Xibei, hints of jealousy flickered past the girl\u2019s eyes.3She hated beautiful girls with slim and willowy bodies like her the most!\u201cI\u2019m Xia Xibei. How can I help you?\u201dLooking at the girl in front of her, Xia Xibei was laughing inside. She was here, just as expected.This girl\u2019s name was Song Jiaren (\u2018Jiaren\u2019 means beauty). Although her name was beautiful, her looks did not match her name.She has always been fat since she was young, and she was even fatter now.With a height of 1.6 meters and a body weight of 85 kilograms, the spotlight would be fixed on her wherever she went.Fat girls like her would usually get bullied, but her father was an influential gangster in the area.Therefore, she walked with her nose upturned in the school.The reason Xia Xibei crossed paths with her was all because of Yang Xuan.It was because she was one of Yang Xuan\u2019s\u2026 girlfriends.The reason why Yang Xuan didn\u2019t make his relationship with Xia Xibei public was all because of Song Jiaren\u2019s presence.She was the daughter of the gang\u2019s chief. If that man were to know that he was being unfaithful to his daughter, he would definitely have his balls ripped off!Xia Xibei wasn\u2019t aware of it in the past, which nearly got her killed later, because of Yang Xuan.Yang Xuan had no guts to let Song Jiaren know about him and Xia Xibei, but he had done lots of nasty things to Xia Xibei by relying on Song Jiaren\u2019s reputation.A few years later, Yang Xuan even married Song Jiaren as though he had always been infatuated with her.Xia Xibei had to admit that she had some admiration for Yang Xuan: at least he was as cruel to himself as he was to other people!1However, Xia Xibei would never allow Yang Xuan to continue behaving as he pleased this time!\u201cIt was you who said that Yang Xuan borrowed your money?\u201d Song Jiaren shot a glare at her, but her eyes were too small, which made her seem ludicrous instead of intimidating.Xia Xibei nodded, as if she did not notice the threat from the girls at the back.\u201cYes!\u201d She nodded. \u201cHe borrowed 20,000 yuan from me!\u201d\u201cLiar!\u201d Song Jiaren immediately responded, \u201cHow could he have borrowed your money!\u201dFrom Song Jiaren\u2019s point of view, Xia Xibei was lying.She was Yang Xuan\u2019s girlfriend; why would Yang Xuan need to borrow someone else\u2019s money?Putting that aside, what could a mere 20,000 yuan do?She had tens of thousands of yuan in her pocket every month, why would Yang Xuan even borrow 20,000 yuan from someone else?\u201cI\u2019m not lying!\u201d Xia Xibei was serious. \u201cI only lent him the money because his girlfriend agreed to be his guarantor!\u201d\u201cGirlfriend?\u201dSong Jiaren was truly stunned this time around. \u201cWhat girlfriend?!\u201dShe was Yang Xuan\u2019s girlfriend, when had there ever been another one?!\u201cHis girlfriend is called Jin Yazhen, she used to be my good friend.\u201d Xia Xibei pretended not to notice her shock.\u201cJin Yazhen?\u201d The look on Song Jiaren\u2019s face changed subtly. \u201cHow come I heard that you are the one who\u2019s Yang Xuan\u2019s girlfriend?\u201d\u201cWho are you kidding!\u201d Xia Xibei shrieked. \u201cHow can Yang Xuan and I be a couple! I have met him a few times indeed, but I\u2019ve always been a third wheel. He has been with Jin Yazhen all along!\u201dEvery time Yang Xuan appeared, Jin Yazhen was present.Therefore, there was nothing wrong with what Xia Xibei said.Song Jiaren frowned, her face turning awful. \u201cThen why did Yang Xuan say that you and him are a couple?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s so evil!\u201d Xia Xibei\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cIs he trying not to return my money?!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Twenty thousand yuan is just a little pocket money to them, but as far as I\u2019m concerned, it was all the savings that I had!\u201dLooking at how angry Xia Xibei was, the suspicion on Song Jiaren and the others\u2019 faces faded away.If she really had been in a relationship with Yang Xuan, this wouldn\u2019t have been her reaction.\u201cAnd I swear that Yang Xuan and Jin Yazhen are a couple! If I lied, I\u2019d be struck by lightning!\u201dXia Xibei raised a hand and swore without guilty conscience.She wasn\u2019t lying.Yang Xuan and Jin Yazhen had hooked up indeed.Song Jiaren\u2019s face turned even more awful.\u201cJin Yazhen?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Xia Xibei nodded. \u201cJin Yazhen was once my good friend, but I only found out now that she was only friends with me for my money! How abominable!\u201d\u201cFor real?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201dXia Xibei nodded and then voiced her doubt, \u201cBy the way, why did you look for me? It wasn\u2019t because you just wanted to know about them, was it? Or do you want me to help you lose weight?\u201dSong Jiaren was baffled. \u201cLose weight?\u201dHow did this whole matter relate to losing weight?However, she couldn\u2019t bear to hear the phrase \u201close weight\u201d after all.It wasn\u2019t that she hadn\u2019t tried losing weight before. She skipped meals, worked out, and got acupuncture\u2026 She had tried everything she could, but nothing ever worked out for her.She had given up by now.Did Xia Xibei mention \u201closing weight\u201d all of a sudden just to mock her?\u201cWhat do you even mean? Are you humiliating our Sister Jiaren?\u201d The girls at the back yelled.\u201cOf course not!\u201d Xia Xibei shook her head. \u201cWhy would I be humiliating her? Furthermore, that\u2019s what I do for a living now, why would I offend my customers?\u201dCustomers?The girls were puzzled once again.\u201cWhat are you really talking about?\u201dSong Jiaren felt like her mental capacity was running low. How did their topic change from Yang Xuan to losing weight?It was way too dynamic!\u201cMy grandfather is an old practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine, and he has done extensive studies in the weight-loss aspect! I have mastered the notes that he had left behind, thus I\u2019m capable of helping people lose weight. The result would be splendid!\u201d1Her words made the girls laugh. \u201cEven if your grandfather is an old practitioner, just how old are you? How much knowledge could you have mastered?\u201dEveryone knew that it would take years and decades to amass the knowledge and skills of traditional Chinese medicine. Xia Xibei was only in her teens, yet she had the guts to call herself capable. She must be kidding, right?\u201cI don\u2019t know about other areas, but I\u2019m totally confident in the area of weight loss!\u201d Xia Xibei asserted with confidence, making her gorgeous face look even more stunning.\u201cReally? How many people have you helped with losing weight before?\u201d Song Jiaren asked.\u201c\u2026Not a single one, but you\u2019ll be the very first! Also, your facial features are very good-looking, I\u2019m sure that you\u2019ll be a big beauty once you lose the pounds!\u201d Xia Xibei said intently.1The faces of the other girls looked unpleasant.She had never helped anyone lose weight before, but she gave such a wild speech in front of Song Jiaren. Just where did she get the courage? Did she not know Song Jiaren\u2019s status?Song Jiaren wasn\u2019t pleased by Xia Xibei\u2019s words although she knew that she would surely be a beauty once she lost some weight\u2014her parents were good-looking after all.However, Xia Xibei\u2019s words sounded too unconvincing.\u201cAlright, the class is starting soon, let\u2019s go.\u201dSince Xia Xibei and Yang Xuan weren\u2019t a couple, Song Jiaren didn\u2019t see the need to waste any more effort on her.Although she was domineering, she wasn\u2019t an unreasonable person.However, Xia Xibei didn\u2019t let her walk off just like that. She was the first ever customer she had!\u201cDon\u2019t leave in such a hurry! Let\u2019s talk things out if there\u2019s any!

We can get it started today.\u201d\u201cFine.\u201dSong Jiaren shot her a glance and then left with the girls on her heels.Watching their backs as they walked away, Xia Xibei\u2019s lips curled into a creepy smile.\u2018Yang Xuan, let us wait and see!\u2019The reason Xia Xibei hadn\u2019t gotten her hands on Yang Xuan was because of Song Jiaren\u2019s presence.Sure enough, she could carry out her plans for him directly, but if it provoked Song Jiaren, it wouldn\u2019t serve her any benefits.She didn\u2019t want to make too many foes.The reason Song Jiaren liked Yang Xuan was because Yang Xuan would put up a loving and caring front when he was with her, and he didn\u2019t despise her appearance.Song Jiaren might not be aware of it, but she was unable to give up on Yang Xuan because of how well he was treating her.However, if Xia Xibei succeeded in helping her lose weight, more options would open up to her.By then, it wouldn\u2019t be easy for Yang Xuan to meddle with her anymore.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She reported her presence before entering.Once she took her seat, Tang Luo looked over at her with a frown.\u201cAre you alright? I heard that you were blocked by Song Jiaren at the washroom?\u201dHe heard about the matter just a while ago and was prepared to go out when Xia Xibei returned.\u201cI\u2019m fine, it was just a misunderstanding.\u201d Xia Xibei shook her head. \u201cSong Jiaren is quite a nice person.\u201dTang Luo\u2019s lips twitched. How did she even come to the conclusion that Song Jiaren was quite a nice person?\u201cIt\u2019s great that you\u2019re fine, let\u2019s focus on the lesson.\u201dXia Xibei nodded and then hung her head low to read. Moments later, she turned around all of a sudden.Jin Yazhen gasped so loud that it drew the teacher\u2019s attention.\u201cJin Yazhen, what are you doing?\u201d The teacher was wearing an awful look on her face.She was in the midst of teaching intently when she got interrupted. Who wouldn\u2019t get mad at that?\u201cNot-nothing!\u201d Jin Yazhen smiled stiffly.When Xia Xibei returned, she couldn\u2019t identify anything wrong with her, rousing her suspicion.With Song Jiaren\u2019s character, how could Xia Xibei get out of it totally unscathed?She had been staring at Xia Xibei when she turned around the next instant. She was jolted for a second, thus the exaggerated reaction.\u201cReally?\u201d The teacher snorted with a glum face. \u201cAnswer this question then.\u201dJin Yazhen\u2019s face grew even stiffer as she read the question on the blackboard.All of her thoughts were focused on Xia Xibei today. How would she even know what the teacher was talking about?She stood on her spot, stammering for a long time but to no avail. The teacher had no choice but to let her sit down.\u201cEven though you guys are only in sophomore year, you\u2019re going to be in senior year the next semester. It\u2019s time you focus on your studies!\u201d4Although her words weren\u2019t exactly harsh, Jin Yazhen got so embarrassed that her face and ears turned red.The looks that people gave her made her even more uneasy.And all Xia Xibei did was flash her a creepy smile.2Jin Yazhen was frightened by Xia Xibei\u2019s strange smile, but she managed to hold herself back from screaming.What was the matter with Xia Xibei? Why was she so different today?The class finally ended. Jin Yazhen approached Xia Xibei again.\u201cXibei\u2026\u201d\u201cHave you decided to pay me back?\u201dXia Xibei spoke before she could even say a word.The look on Jin Yazhen\u2019s face turned even more awful when she heard those words.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me who borrowed the money!\u201d She panicked.\u201cAlthough you didn\u2019t, the two of you spent it together anyway, right?\u201d Xia Xibei stared at her with a poker face.\u201cI\u2026\u201dJin Yazhen\u2019s heart raced. How did Xia Xibei know that?\u201cXibei, you have misunderstood\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you have the guts to take a vow then? If you really did spend the money, you will be struck by lightning and die a painful death!\u201d1Jin Yazhen froze.\u201cJin Yazhen, don\u2019t fool Xia Xibei as though she\u2019s a three-year-old, will you?\u201dTang Luo couldn\u2019t hold it back any longer, he teased, \u201cYou can\u2019t be a b*tch while trying to maintain a good reputation! As a person, you must live by conscience! Xia Xibei has been good to you all along.\u201dOthers joined the fuss. \u201cRight! You can\u2019t be that shameless!\u201d\u201cI did not!\u201d Jin Yazhen got more nervous, but she couldn\u2019t find a way to explain herself in the heat of the moment.She was usually eloquent, but in the face of Xia Xibei, who had turned into a whole new person, she was helpless.\u201cFine. If you\u2019re not going to pay me back, don\u2019t talk to me anymore; I\u2019m busy!\u201dXia Xibei turned around and left right after she finished speaking.She had to go look for herbs!The treatment for Song Jiaren would begin tonight, and she was a big client!Once she was out of the school compound, Xia Xibei got on a bus.

As long as one could afford to pay, a hundred-year-old ginseng would be available.Xia Xibei didn\u2019t need a century-old ginseng, she only needed some common medicinal supplies.There were not too many people in the pharmacy, and the clerk was relatively leisurely.Xia Xibei stepped forward and passed a piece of paper.\u201cI want these medicinal ingredients. Please pack them separately.\u201dThese medicinal supplies needed to be boiled, and the boiling times were different, so they had to be packed separately.\u201cOK.\u201dThe shop clerk nodded and began packing the medicinal supplies.Xia Xibe was bored and began to look around.Soon, her gaze met with that of a tall man.When the person saw her, he was obviously taken aback, and then he stared at her for a while.There was no malice in his eyes, so Xia Xibei didn\u2019t feel offended, but she was very puzzled as she didn\u2019t know him.After a while, the man seemed to recognize her, but instead of coming forward, he quickly walked inside.1\u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019Xia Xibei was confused, but she didn\u2019t go after the man to ask.The clerk continued to grab the medicinal supplies, and she focused again on the medicine.She grabbed a bunch of the medicinal supplies and smelled them, then she nodded.The supplies here were indeed authentic; they had aged enough.The effect would be better this way.After a while, Xia Xibei suddenly felt a numbing sensation on her back. She couldn\u2019t help turning around.When she recognized the person, she couldn\u2019t help widening her eyes.\u2018\u2014Qiao Yanjue?!\u2019What was he doing here?!The man from earlier was standing next to Qiao Yanjue.So the man was Qiao Yanjue\u2019s subordinate.Apparently, they had looked her up!Thinking of this, she looked at Qiao Yanjue with an expression of impatience and disgust.Qiao Yanjue just watched this girl\u2019s expression change again and again.From surprise, to impatience, to disgust, and then finally calm.1If it weren\u2019t for her reaction just now, Qiao Yanjue would have thought she didn\u2019t recognize him!He couldn\u2019t help but think of what he had found out before.Xia Xibei was practically an orphan, her life was difficult, and she had never left this place.However, she seemed to know him.Qiao Yanjue had been injured and was a little sluggish, but he could still feel the change in Xia Xibei\u2019s attitude.This was very strange.Qiao Yanjue admitted that it was the first time to visit this place, and he had always been low-key, so not many people knew his identity.So, how did this Xia Xibei girl know who he was?Anyway, this girl had really changed a lot!Her looks didn\u2019t change; she was still pretty, but she made one feel very different.Although dressed in just a simple T-shirt and jeans, she was very confident. He could not see her timidity as found in the private investigation.\u2018Interesting, very interesting!\u20191Unlike Qiao Yanjue\u2019s interest, Xia Xibei couldn\u2019t help rolling her eyes in her mind.Why did Qiao Yanjue show up here?It had just been a few days. Was his injury healed? So he could go out and play now?Regardless of what he thought, Xia Xibei decided to act as if she did not know him.Qiao Yanjue saw Xia Xibei turning around and giving him her back.He was surprised. This little girl had quite a personality!Thinking of what she said before, \u201cI won\u2019t see you again,\u201d Qiao Yanjue\u2019s mouth turned up in a smile, then he strode forward.As soon as he got next to her, she glanced at him and moved aside.Qiao Yanjue was stunned, so he immediately moved over too.Xia Xibei moved again.He followed again.\u201cUncle, what are you doing? Harassing me?\u201d Xia Xibei was unwilling.4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They hurriedly covered their mouths.2Qiao Yanjue\u2019s face also darkened.\u2018Uncle? Who\u2019s your uncle?!\u2019Qiao Yanjue was twenty-four years old this year. He was at his prime, but he was being called an uncle here?Although he had a reserved disposition, he felt pretty angry at this moment.His subordinates also thought this was ridiculous.The girl was only seventeen years old. She was not quite a grown-up, and the two had a seven-year age gap. However, they were not that far apart in generations, right?3Their Master Jue was a god in the minds of many girls! This girl was too much!If others had dared to say so, then the grass on their graves would have been two meters high by now!Thinking of this, they looked at Xia Xibei with pity.But unexpectedly, Qiao Yanjue did not take offense. He raised his eyebrows instead and looked at Xia Xibei.\u201cDon\u2019t you remember me?\u201dThese words made Xia Xibei\u2019s mouth twitch, and the look in her eyes showed that she was even more disgusted.Two words were written in those beautiful eyes: despicable animal!\u201cUncle, this kind of pick-up line is very dated, okay? Just because you have a good-looking face, it doesn\u2019t mean you can do whatever you want!\u201dQiao Yanjue\u2019s interest intensified after listening to the girl\u2019s rude words.4He was sure that this little girl got issues!He wasn\u2019t a narcissist. It\u2019s just that whenever other girls saw him, they were never this cold.His aura, not to mention his face, was not something ordinary people had.Xia Xibei was not a girl who didn\u2019t know anything, or who randomly offended people.\u201cOh yeah? Then what should I do?\u201d Qiao Yanjue asked with a smile.The men behind him were stunned, they were almost scared to death!Their Master Jue actually laughed! Was he going to start a fight next?Many people in the capital city knew that Qiao Yanjue was not to be provoked.Despite having a face that looked better than a celebrity, his personality was really bad!2The more he smiled, the worse the outcome for his opponent!With Qiao Yanjue smiling like this, the girl was in big trouble!\u201cSorry. We don\u2019t know each other.\u201dXia Xibei glanced at him, her disgust obvious.\u201cPfft! Ha ha ha ha\u2026\u201dA hearty laugh can be heard from the side.Xia Xibei turned her head and looked. A young man in his twenties was laughing heartily, as if he had seen something funny.The man looked at Qiao Yanjue and then at Xia Xibei, then he laughed even louder.\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d have a day like this, Big Qiao! Ha ha ha ha\u2026\u201dXia Xibei glanced at the man, and she seemed even more disgusted.1She was speechless. Was it not a good day to go out? Why did she encounter two crazies?She didn\u2019t verbalize this, but Qiao Yanjue could tell her train of thought. Upon hearing Huo Zijun\u2019s laugh, Qiao Yanjue\u2019s face darkened even more.\u201cNevermind, I\u2019m not shopping here!\u201dSeeing the reaction of the two men, Xia Xibei made a quick decision. She turned to leave the shop.The man was likely the shop owner who probably had a good relationship with Qiao Yanjue, or he wouldn\u2019t casually call Qiao Yanjue \u201cBig Qiao.\u201dShe didn\u2019t want anything to do with Qiao Yanjue.As soon as she turned, before she had even taken two steps, she felt her stomach hurting.Her heart jumped, and her face changed!\u2018\u2014Did her period come?!\u20196As soon as she had this thought, she felt her stomach turn, and the pain became more intense.The pain came so suddenly that she crouched down, her face looking deathly pale.\u201cWhat happened?\u201dQiao Yanjue strode up to her.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was almost crouching.She was at her most miserable when it was that time of the month.She had been living an impoverished life all these years, and she only ever ate simple food that was poor in nutrients.She started working at the age of thirteen or fourteen. People didn\u2019t want child laborers, so she could only hide in the rear kitchen cleaning dishes.No established premises would want to hire her. At the small shops, she even had to pay for hot water!Although it didn\u2019t snow during winter, the water was still icy cold.Due to her poor state of health, she had her first period only in high school. Ever since then, her menstrual cycle had been disorderly. She had her period only once every few months sometimes, but each time was miserable.She had just been reborn for a couple of days. How would she remember such things?Here it was, catching her unawares!No matter how great she was at medicine, she was rendered powerless in the face of such misery.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201dQiao Yanjue was watching Xia Xibei leave when she hunkered the next moment. Curious, he walked up to her.Once he had a good look at her face, he was startled.Her face was ashen pale, even her lips had lost their color.Xia Xibei gritted her teeth. She couldn\u2019t even muster the strength to reply to him.\u201cHuo Zijun!\u201dQiao Yanjue shouted, \u201cCome here, quick!\u201dHuo Zijun finally stopped laughing and hurried over.\u201cLet me have a look.\u201dHe reached out to touch Xia Xibei\u2019s hand.\u201cWhat are you doing!\u201dQiao Yanjue subliminally shoved his hand away and stared at him with anger in his eyes.Huo Zijun\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cI wanted to assess her pulse! If I don\u2019t, do you think I can identify the problem just by looking?\u201dOnly then did Qiao Yanjue come to his senses. Huo Zijun was a traditional Chinese doctor, his methods would be different for sure.\u201cNo need\u2026\u201dXia Xibei gritted her teeth and said, \u201cI, can walk, by myself!\u201dShe got to her feet as she spoke.Before she could gain her footing, she swayed.There was a surge of turbulence in her stomach, and it almost gave her a meltdown!\u201cCareful!\u201dQiao Yanjue was startled. He moved forward in wide strides and held her up.She bumped head-on into Qiao Yanjue\u2019s arms. It was so painful that she nearly passed out.The girl\u2019s soft, warm body almost put Qiao Yanjue into a trance, but he panicked when he felt the body in his arms shiver.\u201cQuick, find out what\u2019s wrong with her!\u201dHuo Zijun frowned. \u201cDon\u2019t panic!\u201dAs he reached out and held Xia Xibei\u2019s wrist, he knew where the problem lied right away.\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d\u201cNot a big deal?\u201d Qiao Yanjue shot him a glare. \u201cWhy is she in so much pain then?\u201dHuo Zijun shrugged. \u201cThis is a problem common among girls, it is just slightly more severe for her.\u201dIt was a special period of time that had to be taken seriously.Besides, it was also determined by the individual\u2019s body constitution. Some girls had no problem with it but some had experienced so much pain it felt like dying to them.Qiao Yanjue wasn\u2019t stupid, he understood what was going on immediately. However, his doubt did not dwindle.\u201cBut why is she in such an excruciating pain?\u201dEven if it were period cramps, it wouldn\u2019t have been so intense, right?Huo Zijun shrugged. \u201cBody constitution differs from one individual to another, some experience a lot of pain. Besides, she is a little malnourished, she isn\u2019t in a very good state of health.\u201dMalnourished?Qiao Yanjue\u2019s brows were deeply furrowed.It seemed that the results of his previous investigation were true, Xia Xibei hadn\u2019t been living a good life indeed.It was truly surprising that there were people living in these cities that were malnourished.\u201cSir, let me take over\u2026\u201dA man stepped forward in an attemPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Wasn\u2019t he just trying to help relieve Qiao Yanjue\u2019s burden?His partner was speechless. How could someone be so stupid? How could he not see what was really going on?1Looking at Qiao Yanjue, who was holding Xia Xibei in his arms, he seemed completely different from his usual ruthless self!Besides, this was the first time a girl had ever gotten so close to him.Although Qiao Yanjue was good-looking and was the idol of many girls, there weren\u2019t many who dared go near him.He wouldn\u2019t be nice just because they were girls.Quite opposite to that, his cold attitude and violence had made lots of girls cry.Worse still, he was a clean freak!3He would despise girls just because they wore perfume!That was why he was still single at the age of twenty-four!Even Huo Zijun was looking at Qiao Yanjue. \u201cHave you fallen in love?\u201d1They had been good friends for many years. Sure enough, he knew Qiao Yanjue\u2019s character much better than his subordinates.He was a guy that was destined to be alone!However, he was holding a little girl and refusing to let her go right now. That was very surprising.He had never even treated Li Weiyun that way, a friend whom they grew up with.Qiao Yanjue glowered at him. \u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about? Save the patient first!\u201dXia Xibei was so pained that she stopped being self-conscioushad lost her consciousness;, she had forgotten about being in Qiao Yanjue\u2019s arms. All she could do was try her best to fight the pain.It had been many years since she last experienced such pain; she had forgotten all about it.She was devastated to be experiencing this all over again now.\u201cBring her in then,\u201d Huo Zijun instructed while pointing at the back.The next moment, he saw a scene that made his jaw drop in awe.Qiao Yanjue lifted Xia Xibei off her feet and carried her!\u2014As though she was a princess!\u201cHold on!\u201dHuo Zijun shouted, but he then the next found, he noticed a streak of redness on Qiao Yanjue\u2019s abdomen.\u201cGoodness!\u201d Huo Zijun slapped his forehead. Speechless, he asked, \u201cHave you any idea about your own condition?\u201dQiao Yanjue was shot previously. Although the bullet had been removed and his life wasn\u2019t at risk, he still shouldn\u2019t be using much force for the time being!And look, his wound had just been torn open!\u201cSir!\u201dThe others panicked right away; one by one, they stepped forth.\u201cGet out of my way!\u201dQiao Yanjue said with a stern, cold face. He forgot about his own injury indeed, but it was a critical time. Did they expect him to hand Xia Xibei over?They exchanged puzzled glances, but made way for him as ordered.Qiao Yanjue walked off in wide strides with Xia Xibei in his arms.Huo Zijun followed behind him; he couldn\u2019t help but shake his head and mumble softly, \u201cYet you said you have fallen in love, being single serves you right!\u201d1However, he didn\u2019t plan to keep dwelling on the problem.So what if Qiao Yanjue had fallen in love? Xia Xibei was just an ordinary girl; how long could his feelings last?1Even if they really got together, it wouldn\u2019t last long.The difference between them was like the Great Rift Valley.There was a room behind the herb store, and there was a bed in the room.Qiao Yanjue placed Xia Xibei on the bed. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d\u201cLet me help you with your wound first\u2026\u201d\u201cNo need, it\u2019s no big deal. Treat her first!\u201d Qiao Yanjue refused.Huo Zijun shot him a glare and had no choice but to treat Xia Xibei first.Right when he was about to prescribe medications, he saw Xia Xibei opening her eyes.\u201cHelp me\u2026 cook some herbs.\u201dThen, she listed the names of all the herbs that were needed.By the time she finished, Huo Zijun was in great awe!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After all, she was only a teenager; how could she know how to prescribe medicine?Moreover, traditional Chinese medicine was not the same as Western medicine. In Western medicine, one could try to find some pain relief on one\u2019s own, but the checks and balances in traditional Chinese medicine were not so easily managed.Taking medicines without knowledge could lead to deaths!1However, the combination of the medicinal materials that Xia Xibei described was extremely clever!Huo Zijun looked at a very pale Xia Xibei with a shocked expression. \u201cWho gave you the prescription?\u201dThe pain in Xia Xibei\u2019s stomach had temporarily subsided, so she had the strength to answer Huo Zijun\u2019s question.\u201cI made it myself. Could you please help? Boil with three bowls of water, then simmer for half an hour, thank you.\u201dHuo Zijun was stunned for a moment before he let people prepare the medicinal supplies.After giving the order, he looked at Xia Xibei, \u201cDo you know traditional Chinese medicine?\u201dShe didn\u2019t look like it!Xia Xibei was young, and if she knew Chinese medicine, why didn\u2019t she take care of herself?But looking at the medicine she prescribed, it was much better than the version he thought of.The two prescriptions were not at the same level.This really confused him.\u201cI understand some.\u201d Xia Xibei gritted her teeth and then blushed again, struggling to get up.\u201cWhat are you doing getting up? Aren\u2019t you hurt?\u201d Qiao Yanjue pushed her back down with a dark face.\u201cLet go!\u201d Xia Xibei blushed and shouted in a low voice, \u201cI\u2019m going to the bathroom!\u201dShe could feel that her pants were wet.Qiao Yanjue\u2019s movements froze. He was rarely embarrassed.\u201cThe bathroom is in here, but I don\u2019t have what you want here.\u201d Huo Zijun said with a shrug and gave Qiao Yanjue a look.His shop has female employees, but he had given them time off for a few days.In the end, it was all because of Qiao Yanjue.Why did he hate women?And given his current situation, it was not really not suitable for a woman to get close to him.Xia Xibei\u2019s face was still very pale, \u201cI can buy it myself.\u201d\u201cLay back down!\u201d Qiao Yanjue frowned and said, \u201cI\u2019ll get someone to buy it for you!\u201d1Xia Xibei shook her head, \u201cI don\u2019t want to bother you\u2026\u201d\u201cYou have already bothered me!\u201dQiao Yanjue interrupted her and showed her the blood stains on his chest, \u201cI\u2019ll have someone go!\u201dAfter talking, he looked at his subordinates.\u201c\u2026Yes, young master!\u201dSeveral tall men blushed in embarrassment.6They never had to buy these things before as men, ah!However, after meeting Qiao Yanjue\u2019s eyes, they did not dare to have any objections. They immediately left.Soon, they brought the things back.Looking at the box of sanitary napkins, Xia Xibei\u2019s mouth twitched. She was speechless.There were at least a few dozen packs of sanitary napkins here, for day, for night, in mesh, in cotton\u2026 everything.2There was so much; when would she use them all?But now was not a time to refuse. Her period was coming in more than ever.Fortunately, Huo Zijun was considerate and found a pair of pants for her.Although the pants were a bit big, they were better than nothing.By the time Xia Xibei changed into the pants and came out, the medicine was ready too.Smelling the bitter scent with a hint of sweetness, Xia Xibei didn\u2019t hesitate and readily drank the bowl of concoction.After drinking, Xia Xibei felt a little more warmth in her cold belly, and her heart-piercing pain was finally relieved. Her complexion also improved a lot.Huo Zijun finally found a chance to ask, \u201cYou know traditional Chinese medicine?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Xia Xibei nodded.\u201cWhat are you buying these for?\u201d He took out the medicine list that Xia Xibei had dropped earlier.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This was a really hard feeling!He was so angry he grinned, his eyes pausing on Xia Xibei\u2019s school bag.1Then he took ahold of her schoolbag.\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201dXia Xibei was anxious, but she couldn\u2019t stop Qiao Yanjue\u2019s movements at all.\u201cThis is mine, don\u2019t you understand privacy?!\u201dBecause of her excitement, Xia Xibei\u2019s stomach hurt again, and she could only get back into bed.Her eyes were filled with anger as she looked at Qiao Yanjue.Did she meet a fake Qiao Yanjue?!The thirty-year-old Qiao Yanjue was cold, cruel, evil, and domineering.1Then how come this Qiao Yanjue would do something like this?!Huo Zijun also looked at Qiao Yanjue in bewilderment. The Qiao Yanjue he knew never touched other people\u2019s things casually.\u2014Of course, it was also unlikely for a tiny girl to ignore Qiao Yanjue in the past either.Qiao Yanjue had no idea he was being slandered and suspected and simply took out a lighter from the school bag.\u201cWhere did you get this?\u201dLooking at this lighter, Xia Xibei was stunned.\u201cI\u2026\u201dOf course, this lighter was her reward for saving Qiao Yanjue before.

What about this time?\u201d He took in a deep breath before asking.\u201cThis time?\u201d Xia Xibei looked at him, surprised. She was clueless about what he meant.Qiao Yanjue rolled up his shirt, exposing his flat belly and the wound on it from which blood was seeping out.\u201cMy wound cracked open when I carried you inside just now. What do you think?\u201d1Huo Zijun\u2019s lips twitched. Even if the wound cracked open again indeed, it wouldn\u2019t be that serious, rightwas it?However, he did not speak up as he watched the drama with great interest instead.He was thinking to himself, he was definitely going to share this incident when he met with the others later.This side of Qiao Yanjue was far too rare!Although he kept a straight face, Huo Zijun could see that he was going crazy.Xia Xibei looked at Qiao Yanjue\u2019s wound and said with a frown, \u201cI\u2019ll prescribe you with some medicines, you\u2019ll be alright very soon.\u201dOnce he got well, there would be no more interaction between them.Qiao Yanjue heard the overtone of her words, and the fire of anger burned even more vigorously in him.\u201cIs your gratitude that cheap?\u201d\u201cWhen I saved your life back then, I didn\u2019t ask for a lot in return!\u201d Xia Xibei replied unhappily.\u201cYou made the request yourself. Now that I helped you, my request is different from yours.\u201dXia Xibei\u2019s face darkened;, she began doubting Qiao Yanjue\u2019s identity again.This surely wasn\u2019t the Master Jue whom everyone revered! How was he so petty!\u201cWhat do you want then?\u201d She asked with her teeth gritted.\u201cI just want you to remember that you owe me once.\u201dQiao Yanjue finally smiled when he saw her attitude soften.\u201cI don\u2019t have money!\u201d Xia Xibei blurted out with a dark face.\u201cThat\u2019s fine, I have money, I don\u2019t need you to give me money.\u201dLooking at Qiao Yanjue\u2019s smile, she had to fight back the urge to toss the pants in her hand at him!How could he be so shameless?!Huo Zijun, who was watching the drama at the side, coughed softly, breaking off the heated confrontation between them.He looked over at Xia Xibei. \u201cYou said that you were going to prescribe him with medicines, what medicines do you think should be used then? He\u2019s going back in a few days; it is best if he could make a full recovery before that.\u201d\u201cGoing back?\u201d Xia Xibei\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cIn a few days\u2019 time?\u201dQiao Yanjue\u2019s cheerful mood dipped down once again when he saw how excited she looked.Was she happy because he was leaving?He felt his own hands itch. He wanted to squeeze her face so bad, so he didn\u2019t have to see her annoying look of excitement.Huo Zijun noticed Xia Xibei\u2019s repulsion toward Qiao Yanjue as well. He coughed a few times and concealed the smile on his lips.Only then did he speak, \u201cHe could stay here up to a week at most?\u201dA week?Xia Xibei\u2019s eyes grew even brighter.2Qiao Yanjue felt even gloomier. .2He was bewildered. What kind of love and hate did he have with this little girl that made her so reluctant to be with him?\u201cHe could make a full recovery in one week if there aren\u2019t any unforeseen circumstances.\u201dLuckily, Xia Xibei remembered what was most important.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Without being led by a master, it was very difficult for one to continue down the path.It was different from western doctors that were produced in batches, which caused traditional Chinese medicine to suffer a gradual downfall.Once he got to know who Xia Xibei\u2019s master was, he would know her level.\u201cYou can\u2019t tell?\u201d Huo Zijun asked.\u201cIt\u2019s not that I can\u2019t tell, but you wouldn\u2019t know the person even if I tell you.\u201d Xia Xibei shrugged. \u201cIf you\u2019re willing to let me treat him, I\u2019ll commence. If you\u2019re reluctant, you could settle it on your own.\u201dShe wasn\u2019t so earnest in treating Qiao Yanjue after all!She wouldn\u2019t even save him if she had known this! This guy was so annoying!\u201cAlright, you treat me.\u201dQiao Yanjue gave her the green light before Huo Zijun had properly considered it.\u201cYanjue!\u201d Huo Zijun panicked.\u201cI trust her.\u201dQiao Yanjue recalled the time when Xia Xibei helped him clean his wound. Her skills were smooth and clean, without the slightest bit of hesitation.Although he wasn\u2019t completely conscious, he could feel that Xia Xibei was capable.Hence, he trusted her when she said she could do it.\u2018I trust her.\u2019His words startled Xia Xibei a little. She never expected Qiao Yanjue to have so much confidence in her.She felt that he wasn\u2019t as annoying as before because of those three words that he had said.\u201cTo ensure the results of the treatment, you have to come here every day.\u201dXia Xibei frowned. \u201cNo way!

How much are they?\u201d Xia Xibei asked.\u201cThey\u2019re free.\u201dHuo Zijun looked at Qiao Yanjue before Xia Xibei could refuse. \u201cThis Mr. Qiao next to you is very rich. These are his medical expenses.\u201dXia Xibei was stunned; she kept feeling as if she had overlooked something.But she didn\u2019t think too much. She took the medicinal ingredients and nodded at Qiao Yanjue. \u201cThank you.\u201dIt was rare to hear such kind words from Xia Xibei, and Qiao Yanjue could not react for a while.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Qiao Yanjue coughed and took over the medicinal package in Xia Xibei\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019ll carry it for you.\u201dXia Xibei couldn\u2019t help raising her eyebrows upon looking at her empty arms.1She didn\u2019t expect that\u00a0Qiao Yanjue could be quite warm!After getting in the car, Xia Xibei frowned, \u201cWhy did you get in the car?

She didn\u2019t think Xia Xibei would come back.Thinking of this, Jin Yazhen walked up to Xia Xibei.\u201cXibei, is the head teacher looking for you about Yang Xuan?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s it to you?\u201d The corner of Xia Xibei\u2019s lips curled up into a sneer.\u201cI\u2019m just worried about you.

It was a huge joke to say that she would ever hit Yang Xuan! As for being in a relationship at such a young age, that was even less likely.\u201cMister Yang, before we come to a conclusion with this matter, please calm down first and get to understand this whole situation,\u201d Teacher Zhang implored, looking at Yang Xuan\u2019s father.\u201cWhy does it need more understanding?

I hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201dThe two teachers flashed a small smile, saying nothing.\u201cXia Xibei, we called you over to learn more about your fight with Yang Xuan this morning.\u201dTeacher Liu looked over at Xia Xibei, the look on his face turning much more amiable than when he had looked at Yang Xuan and his family.\u201cFight?\u201d Xia Xibei put on a stunned look. \u201cDidn\u2019t you call me to talk about him returning my money?\u201dReturning money???Yang Xuan\u2019s heart skipped a beat, looking over at Xia Xibei abruptly.\u201cReturn what money, what nonsense are you talking about!\u201d Yang Xuan\u2019s mother shouted, slamming the table. \u201cOur Xuan Xuan doesn\u2019t like you, so you hit him, and now you\u2019re trying to get away with it?!\u201dThe thunderous noise from the impact on the table made the teachers\u2019 faces darken.\u201cMadam Xie, please behave yourself, this is public property owned by the school!\u201dTheir tones were slightly harsh, which made Yang Xuan and his father cringe.Xia Xibei, however, wasn\u2019t affected by the woman\u2019s attitude, only looking at them with shock and innocence. \u201cWhen did I ever hit him! I did not hit him at all!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re lying!\u201d Yang Xuan couldn\u2019t help but chip in. \u201cYou did hit me! You threw me over your shoulder, and then punched me a few times!\u201dHe pointed at the injuries on him, \u201cThese are there because you hit me!\u201dXia Xibei was even more stupefied now. \u201cHow could that be possible! You\u2019re falsely accusing me! Don\u2019t even think that you don\u2019t need to return my money just because you said that!\u201d\u201cReturn your money?\u201d Teacher Liu inquired, \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\u201cThis godda*n girl must be lying! Our Xuan Xuan wouldn\u2019t borrow money from other people!\u201d Yang Xuan\u2019s mother interjected.\u201cWe will look into the matter and find out what really happened,\u201d Teacher Liu informed her before looking at Yang Xuan\u2019s father with a dark face. \u201cMister Yang, what do you think?\u201dYang Xuan\u2019s father noticed the teachers\u2019 displeasure and shot his wife a glare. \u201cWe\u2019ll find out what happened first!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If she kept throwing tantrums like this, how would the matter ever be resolved?\u201cWhy did you guys meet up?\u201d\u201cBecause I wanted to ask him to return my money,\u201d Xia Xibei answered, bold and straightforward, not a tinge of guilt to be seen in her.\u201cReturn your money? He borrowed money from you?\u201d\u201cYes, he borrowed quite a lot of money from me,\u201d Xia Xibei replied, answering whatever questions were raised. \u201cThat money was all my savings. I needed to use it now, so I asked him to pay me back, but he refused.\u201d\u201cSo, you guys had a conflict?\u201d\u201cWe argued a bit, but I didn\u2019t hit him. I went back in when class started.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re lying!\u201d Yang Xuan panicked, \u201cYou did hit me!\u201dXia Xibei\u2019s face fell, saying with a puzzled look, \u201cYang Xuan, I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re saying I hit you. Do you have any proof?\u201d\u201cThis is the proof!\u201d Yang Xuan pointed to the scars on his face, furious. \u201cI even have injuries on my back!\u201dXia Xibei shot him a glare, arguing, \u201cYou\u2019re just finding excuses to not pay me back!\u201d She looked over at the two teachers when she said that, explaining, \u201cI asked him to pay me back today, but he was reluctant. I got really mad and said I wanted to ask the teachers to get involved. But he threatened me, saying he would never pay me back and he\u2019ll teach me a lesson I\u2019d never forget! Not only would I not receive the money, I\u2019d even get humiliated! I didn\u2019t think he was being serious! I never expected\u2026\u201dXia Xibei cast a glance at his parents, seeming a little cautious and timid.The two teachers finally sorted things out, becoming furious instantly.\u201cWhat is your connection to Yang Xuan? Are you guys in a romantic relationship?\u201d Teacher Zhang asked.The Yangs claimed that Xia Xibei was pursuing Yang Xuan. However, Yang Xuan didn\u2019t want his studies to be affected, so he went to talk things over with her, but she beat him up instead.\u201cNo, we are not,\u201d Xia Xibei shook her head immediately. \u201cHow could I even have the time for relationships!\u201d She looked at the teachers sincerely, begging them, \u201cTeachers, I assume you know my circumstances. I have to work!\u201d\u201cSo, you have no relationship at all with Yang Xuan?\u201d\u201cWe know each other and have had some interactions, but absolutely nothing romantic!\u201d Xia Xibei said firmly and resolutely.\u201cWhy would he claim that you were pursuing him, then?\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d Xia Xibei\u2019s eyes grew as wide as saucers, staring at Yang Xuan in disbelief. \u201cWas that how he tried to slander me?! He has a girlfriend already!\u201d\u201cHe has a girlfriend?\u201d Teacher Zhang questioned.\u201cHis girlfriend is Jin Yazhen. I was once good friends with Jin Yazhen. She became Yang Xuan\u2019s guarantor, so I lent my money to Yang Xuan. But I didn\u2019t expect them to gang together and deceive me!\u201dXia Xibei\u2019s eyes turned red, tears swelling up in her eyes.Her reaction gained pity from the teachers, leading them to ask further, \u201cWhat really happened? Tell us all about it.\u201d\u201cI did not! She\u2019s lying!\u201d Yang Xuan panicked.\u201cThis godda*n girl must be lying!\u201d Yang Xuan\u2019s mother couldn\u2019t help but step forward. \u201cOur Xuan Xuan would never owe anyone a debt!\u201dTeacher Liu looked at Yang Xuan\u2019s father with a stormy face, demanding, \u201cMister Yang, I wish you would cooperate with us in our work!\u201dYang Xuan\u2019s father could only hold his wife back and glower at her, hissing, \u201cListen to them first!\u201d\u201cXia Xibei, you may go on.\u201dXia Xibei reiterated her previous statement.\u201cYang Xuan and Jin Yazhen are a couple.

If that was the case, it was truly heinous!\u201cHow much did he borrow?\u201d\u201cTwenty thousand,\u201d Xia Xibei said immediately.\u201cYou are ying! You said ten thousand before!\u201d Yang Xuan blurted out.1Immediately, the other people looked at him, their expressions complicated.\u201cSo, you really borrowed money from her?\u201d The teachers\u2019 questioned, their gazes becoming a little dangerous.\u201cImpossible!\u201d Yang Xuan\u2019s mother interrupted again, \u201cOur Xuan Xuan\u2019s pocket money is way more than that. Why would he need to borrow money?\u201dThese words made the teachers side eye their family even more subtly.Yang Xuan had this much pocket money? It was ludicrous! Altogether, the couple probably made less than 10 thousand yuan a month.Yang Xuan\u2019s father was a little embarrassed, tugging on his wife\u2019s arm and then looking at Xia Xibei. \u201cClassmate, you said that Xuan Xuan borrowed money from you. Do you have any evidence of it?\u201d\u201cYes! Where is the IOU!\u201d Yang Xuan\u2019s mother seemed to think she had discovered a loophole and immediately cheered up.\u201cI don\u2019t have any evidence,\u201d Xia Xibei shook her head.\u201cI am telling you! She is lying!\u201d Yang Xuan\u2019s mother became even more excited, while Yang Xuan seemed to relax.When he borrowed money from Xia Xibei, he didn\u2019t leave an IOU!And at the time, Xia Xibe would not have thought to ask for that.\u201cTeachers, this kind of student is awful. I think she must lie all the time, to be so calm in this situation! You must really discipline her! And she beats people! This kind of violent and lying student will ruin the school atmosphere!\u201d Yang Xuan\u2019s mother looked even more proud as she spoke those words. \u201cOur Xuan Xuan is a good student. He shouldn\u2019t be affected like this!\u201dSeeing the smug look on Yang Xuan\u2019s mother, Xia Xibei lowered her head slightly, a sneer appearing at the corner of her mouth.When she looked up, she said, \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t have any IOUs, I still have some evidence from when I transferred the money!\u201dThese words stunned the Yang family, who still looked quite proud.The two teachers, however, showed a slight smile. \u201cEvidence?\u201dOf course they believed Xia Xibei more than the unreasonable Yang family. As a result, they became happy when they heard there was evidence.\u201cYes,\u201d Xia Xibei nodded, taking out several bank transfer receipts from her pocket.Xia Xibei\u2019s money had all been saved in the bank previously. So, every time he needed money, she\u2019d go to get it from the bank and transfer it to Yang Xuan\u2019s card.Yang Xuan panicked upon seeing those bank transfer receipts.Impossible! She couldn\u2019t have kept these things!They were usually thrown out after transferring or withdrawing money.Why had Xia Xibei kept them?How could he have known that Xia Xibei kept these receipts as mementos of their relationship? After all, she didn\u2019t have time to watch movies with him, so there were no movie stubs, or anything symbolically romantic, since Yang Xuan never gave her any gifts.Now, these receipts were proven useful.The receipts the two teachers held clearly showed that the recipient and the lender were Yang Xuan and Xia Xibei, respectively. Additionally, the amount added up to more than 10 thousand yuan.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201dAfter seeing the evidence, Teacher Liu handed over the receipts.The expressions on the Yang family\u2019x faces could not be described as they looked at the names on the receipts. They were too shocked.Yang Xuan, especially, seemed surprised and anxious, his face pale.It was Yang Xuan\u2019s mom, however, who had the worst reaction when seeing the words.She did not think that her son would really borrow money from the girl! And he had denied doing so afterwards!What she did stunned everyone\u2026She tore up the receipts and ate them!4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This was the first time they had seen a move like this!Only Xia Xibei was relatively calm. She knew Yang Xuan\u2019s mom\u2019s true character and she had already prepared for this scenario.However, she was also very surprised. She thought that Yang Xuan\u2019s mom would find a way to deny it, but she never expected the method to be so simple and rude!\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dAfter the two teachers recovered, they laughed lightly out of exasperation. Wasn\u2019t she afraid of indigestion?Yang Xuan\u2019s mom held her neck high and said, \u201cWhy would I keep those fake receipts, so they could slander our Xuan Xuan?\u201d\u201cIf they\u2019re fake, why did you destroy them?\u201d Xia Xibei asked.\u201cYou are such a shameless girl! You wanted to slander us with fake evidence! I won\u2019t let you win!\u201d Yang Xuan\u2019s mom glared at Xia Xibei. At the same time, she inwardly rejoiced. It was fortunate that she had acted so quickly.If those receipts were kept, Yang Xuan would have lost face.But she didn\u2019t know that this would make her lose even more face!Yang Xuan, for his part, was also dumbfounded. He never thought that his mother would do something so insane!\u201cI don\u2019t know if they are fake or not. But\u2026\u201d Xia Xibei\u2019s expression twitched a little, almost as if she had smiled for a second before dropping it from her face.\u201cBut what?\u201d Teacher Liu asked.\u201cBut\u2026 those receipts fell on the bathroom floor just now, and I had only just managed to dry them\u2026\u201dBathroom?Everyone\u2019s expressions changed.2Even if those papers did not fall into the toilet, the floor wasn\u2019t a very clean place either.And Yang Xuan\u2019s mom had eaten them\u2026Everyone watched Yang Xuan\u2019s mom with the same horrified expression.Yang Xuan\u2019s mom froze for just a moment. After finally processing the information, she felt as if she had eaten a pound of excrement, immediately nauseated.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dThe more she thought about it, the more nauseous she got. To get some relief, she pinched her neck and started retching. Unfortunately, once you put something in your stomach, it does not come out easily.1Yang Xuan and his father\u2019s expressions were even more ugly, feeling just as sick as the mother.They really didn\u2019t think that things would develop like this. So mortifying!The two teachers finally felt a little more relaxed. The way they watched Yang Xuan\u2019s mom showed condemnation and contempt.Did she think everyone was stupid? Just because the evidence had been eaten, did it mean that it had never existed in the first place?Most importantly, this showed that Yang Xuan was lying!Realizing this, Yang Xuan\u2019s head teacher looked at him in an even worse way.Teacher Zhang hadn\u2019t felt good about Yang Xuan to begin with. He thought that Yang Xuan was too ostentatious and unreliable. Now he knew that Yang Xuan had lied too! Not only did he not admit borrowing the money, he had slandered the innocent girl, saying she had beat him!His character was too despicable!\u201cAlso, why did you eat them?\u201d Xia Xibei looked at Yang Xuan\u2019s mom in a puzzled and innocent way. \u201cI have copies of these receipts, and I can give you as many of them as you want.\u201d2As soon as these words came out of Xia Xibei\u2019s mouth, Yang Xuan\u2019s mom stopped vomiting.Did that mean what she had just done was useless? Had she done all that to herself for nothing?Yang Xuan\u2019s mom wanted to cry, but had no tears left.Yang Xuan and his father also had complicated expressions on their faces.\u201cTeacher, I think things should be very clear by now,\u201d Xia Xibei looked at the two teachers. \u201cI really lent a lot of money to Yang Xuan, and I didn\u2019t beat him up!\u201d\u201cYou are lying!\u201d Yang Xuan exclaimed in panic, \u201cYou did beat me!\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d Teacher Zhang immediately shouted, his face having turned dark and stormy, \u201cWe know who is lying!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How could she have fought a big boy like Yang Xuan?Yang Xuan\u2019s mother\u2019s attitude and behavior didn\u2019t do him any favors either, repulsing the teachers even more.As for Yang Xuan\u2019s father, although he didn\u2019t say more than a few lines, his lack of participation was exactly what roused their distaste. He was quiet, standing behind his wife and his son, allowing them to partake in this type of behavior. If it wasn\u2019t for his presence, Yang Xuan\u2019s mother wouldn\u2019t have dared to be so fierce and unreasonable.2If they had been the righteous party, their behavior would have, at most, caused the teachers to be a little bit uncomfortable, thinking that they were unforgiving. However, it was proven that they were the ones who were lying!How could they be so flagrant as to come all the way here and make such remarks, with all that they had done?\u201cXia Xibei, how do you think this issue should be dealt with?\u201d Teacher Liu looked over at Xia Xibei, encouragement and solace in his eyes.Xia Xibei felt a surge of warmth within her, flashing him a nervous smile. \u201cThis\u2026I have no other opinions, I just want him to return my money\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s impossible!\u201d Yang Xuan\u2019s mother growled, \u201cOur Xuan Xuan did not borrow your money!\u201d\u201cMadam Xie!\u201d Teacher Liu finally erupted, screaming at her, \u201cYou ought to return the debt you owe, that\u2019s an unquestionable principle!\u201d His chest was rising and falling quickly. \u201cIf we bring this matter before the court, you will be at fault! Don\u2019t think you can brush this matter aside just by eating the evidence!\u201d1Even though Teacher Zhang didn\u2019t really get along with Teacher Liu under normal circumstances, in the face of fierce, unreasonable women like Yang Xuan\u2019s mother, he was equally furious. Yang Xuan\u2019s mother was driving them both crazy.Worse still, Yang Xuan was his student!It was a sort of humiliation to him that his own student had committed such a deed!\u201cYang Xuan, if you are willing to return the money, we can get this matter over and done with fast enough. But if you refuse to admit it and return the money, I have no choice but to report this incident to the principal! As for what the principal is going to do once he learns about this\u2026 I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t want to know.\u201dYang Xuan\u2019s face reddened at Teacher Zhang\u2019s words, hearing the teacher\u2019s dissatisfaction and attempt at intimidation.\u201cTeachers, there must be some misunderstanding going on here\u2026\u201d Yang Xuan\u2019s father stated awkwardly, \u201cOur Yang Xuan really wouldn\u2019t do that\u2026\u201dXia Xibei interrupted him, \u201cHow can it be a misunderstanding? Haven\u2019t I just shown you the evidence?

The whole family was unbelievable.\u201cAlright, my advice is that you should return the money,\u201d Teacher Liu said with a pinched face, \u201cAnd focus on your studies from now on. Do that and you could still be a good student!\u201d\u201cAs for your accusation against me for hitting you, I\u2019m not going to hold on to it anymore. I don\u2019t expect you to apologize either, I just want to get back the money that I lent,\u201d Xia Xibei chimed in, looking beyond sincere.As he looked at her pretty little face, Yang Xuan was so mad that he nearly had a heart attack.How could she speak so shamelessly?! It was her who hit him after all!1\u201cXia Xibei is a forgiving person, Yang Xuan, you shouldn\u2019t be so stubborn anymore,\u201d Teacher Zhang added.\u201cYou borrowed more than 20,000 dollars from me altogether, you just need to return that much to me.\u201d\u201cWhen did I ever borrow so much from you?!

Now that the evidence had been thrown right into his face, he couldn\u2019t deny it anymore.

He\u2019s only a student, so there isn\u2019t much for him to spend on. How would he be able to borrow that amount?\u201d Yang Xuan\u2019s mother had stopped wreaking havoc, but she still didn\u2019t believe that her son would do such a thing.\u201cHe told me that his grandfather was sick, so I lent him 3,000. Then he said that his father had gotten into a car crash and had to get a limb amputated, so I lent him another 4,000. After that, he claimed that his mother broke her arm\u2026\u201d Xia Xibei listed out, simply making up some excuses as she went along.Yang Xuan\u2019s pretexts for borrowing the money were similar to what she had just stated, the only difference being that the victim was always his deceased grandfather.Regardless, Xia Xibei\u2019s words stupefied Yang Xuan\u2019s parents.He really came up with just about any excuse to borrow money!\u201cMister Yang, your leg looks fine to me,\u201d Teacher Yang remarked sarcastically.Yang Xuan\u2019s father shot him an angry, irritated glare. He was cursing him, wasn\u2019t he!He was beyond healthy!\u201cWhen did I ever say that? I never even mentioned it!\u201d Yang Xuan fought back with all his might.However, his argument wasn\u2019t accepted by anyone.His words had lost all credibility.3Even his parents thought he was lying at this point!\u201cWhat did you borrow so much money for? Why would you even need that much?\u201d Yang Xuan\u2019s father was very mad, not bothering to defend his son anymore.\u201cI- I really didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you going to tell me or not!\u201d Yang Xuan\u2019s father raged, so angry that he swung his arm forward and gave his son a harsh slap.Yang Xuan had gone overboard today. If all he had done was lie, he could be forgiven, but he even went so far as to curse his family!Yang Xuan\u2019s mother panicked and exclaimed, \u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d Going to stand in front of her son, she continued in a shrill voice, \u201cCan\u2019t we just talk things out nicely!\u201dAs she watched the ongoing drama among the three members of the Yang family, Xia Xibei\u2019s eyes gleamed with a certain shrewdness.\u201cI know what he spent his money on,\u201d she announced.\u201cYou know?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Xia Xibei nodded. \u201cDidn\u2019t I just say I did?

Who wasn\u2019t aware of what a fortune dating cost?Especially the teachers, who were looking at Yang Xuan with even more disgust in their eyes.Essentially, Yang Xuan had fabricated the stories of accidents or illnesses befalling his family inorder to borrow money from Xia Xibei, spending that same money on Jin Yazhen.And when Xia Xibei needed that money to be paid back, she came looking for him. He couldn\u2019t afford to pay back his debt, so he made up a lie and accused Xia Xibei of hitting him!\u2014\u2014This was beyond despicable!Qing Ye High School was the most prestigious school of the district. Although not every student was noble and virtuous, there wasn\u2019t anyone as bad as him either!1Xia Xibei\u2019s allegation had ignited a fury-filled fire within Yang Xuan\u2019s mother.\u201cWhich shameless b*tch did you spend the money with?

Even if Yang Xuan had borrowed money, it was only because he had been fooled by others and made to do so.\u201cWho is this Jin Yazhen?\u201d she demanded angrily, \u201cI will find her and settle the account!\u201dThe money was all spent on that little b*tch, so of course she should be the one to pay it back!Xia Xibei showed a frightened expression, scrambling to think of a proper response. \u201cYou can fix your own problem later, but you have to pay me back! I really need that money now!\u201dShe looked at the two teachers again, pleading with them, \u201cTeachers, please help me!\u201dTeacher Liu nodded, relenting, \u201cOkay, don\u2019t worry.\u201dAfter agreeing to come to her aid, he turned to Yang Xuan\u2019s parents and said, \u201cSince the matter has been clarified, you should pay back that debt.\u201dYang Xuan\u2019s mom stomped her feet, stubbornly refusing. \u201cOur Xuan Xuan didn\u2019t borrow all this money. If you want it back, go find that Jin Yazhen!\u201dTeacher Zhang\u2019s face darkened, \u201cYang Xuan borrowed the money, so of course he should be the one to pay it back! As for whom it was spent on afterwards, that\u2019s nobody\u2019s business but your own.\u201dTeacher Zhang\u2019s impression of Yang Xuan had truly sunk to the bottom. Thinking about how Yang Xuan was a student in his class, he felt even more disgusted. Someone like this was going to ruin all those around him!Seeing the dark look on the head teacher\u2019s face, Yang Xuan couldn\u2019t help but quake in fear. Most of the teachers at Qing Ye High School had strong personalities, and the two teachers in front of him were especially tough. If this matter really went all the way up to the principal, it would truly be very troublesome.Yang Xuan\u2019s father understood the consequences and what was at stake, so he hurriedly nodded, \u201cWe\u2019ll pay back the money!\u201dEven though he was still very angry, this was his son, his own flesh and blood. How could he not pay back the money?Yang Xuan\u2019s face took on an ugly look, repeating once again, \u201cBut I really didn\u2019t borrow twenty thousand from her!\u201d\u201cYang Xuan!\u201dYang Xuan\u2019s father felt as if he had lost face. He was still denying everything, even now!Yang Xuan was almost crying, acting as if he really had only borrowed ten thousand yuan!\u201cWell, since we\u2019re all here today, let\u2019s resolve this matter. After that, everything will be done and over with, meaning that they can focus on their studies,\u201d Teacher Liu said. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201dWhat did they think? What could they think? Yang Xuan\u2019s father could only nod in agreement. They would be high school seniors in a few months, so they couldn\u2019t possibly let this matter drag on any longer.Yang Xuan\u2019s mom was upset, but she was forced to bitterly nod in assent under her husband\u2019s angry gaze.Yang Xuan had even more unspeakable miseries.He looked at Xia Xibei hatefully, already thinking of other plans in his heart. He was so mad, he could die after being scammed like this by her!Now that it had all been decided, they acted very fast.There was a bank right next to the school, and Yang Xuan\u2019s father quickly withdrew the money.Before handing it over to Xia Xibei, he gave Yang Xuan a fierce look. He\u2019d wait until they returned home to deal with Yang Xuan!After receiving the twenty thousand yuan, Xia Xibei finally showed a bright smile.\u201cThank you, uncle! Thank you, teachers!\u201d\u201cOkay, the matter is over at last. Go back to class now!\u201d\u201cOkay, thanks teachers!\u201d After Xia Xibei expressed her thanks once again, she gave one final glance to Yang Xuan and turned to leave.When Yang Xuan met Xia Xibei\u2019s mocking eyes, he became so angry, almost going up to kick her!Xia Xibei didn\u2019t care how resentful he was. She returned to the classroom, happily and with all that money. Even the pain from her menstrual cramps had lessened by then.Jin Yazhen felt complicated emotions when she saw that Xia Xibei had returned safely.She was so relaxed. Didn\u2019t something happen just now?Xia Xibei turned around and met Jin Yazhen\u2019s eyes, revealing a wicked smile.Yang Xuan\u2019s mom would not let Jin Yazhen get away with all of this just yet.She would wait for the show to start!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was as if she had changed into a completely different person\u2026However, she had no time to obsess over the changes in Xia Xibei, because right after class, she was grabbed by Yang Xuan\u2019s mother as she was walking out of the school gate.\u201cAre you the girl who deceived our Xuan Xuan?\u201dYang Xuan\u2019s mom wasn\u2019t very tall or sturdy, but she was stronger than Jin Yazhen, who might as well have been a baby chick between her hands.\u201cWho are you?\u201d Jin Yazhen was shocked at her capture, twisting and turning as she struggled to get loose, but she couldn\u2019t escape the older woman\u2019s grasp.\u201cI\u2019m Yang Xuan\u2019s mother!\u201d Yang Xuan\u2019s mom informed her, a ferocious expression crossing her face. \u201cYou are Jin Yazhen, right? You swindled Xuan Xuan out of his money and feelings! Why does a b*tch like you even need to go to school?! Why don\u2019t you sell yourself, huh? Well, with your mind and looks, it\u2019s a pretty good deal\u2026\u201d2Yang Xuan\u2019s mom grabbed Jin Yazhen, howling these words at her. The pain of being forcibly parted from 20 thousand yuan made her unable to control herself.Other people were also taken back by the actions of this middle-aged woman, rushing over immediately to aid her victim.\u201cWhat are you doing? Let Jin Yazhen go immediately!\u201dBut Yang Xuan\u2019s mother wouldn\u2019t give up so easily.Yanking back Jin Yazhen\u2019s long hair,she slapped the girl!Slap!The action was so strong, it left a handprint on Jin Yazhen\u2019s face, a clump of her hair also torn off in the process.3\u201cArgh!\u201dFat tears rushed out of Jin Yazhen\u2019s eyes as blinding pain overcame her.\u201cDon\u2019t mess around! This is a school; we will call the police!\u201d the other students hurriedly shouted.As this had occurred around dismissal time, the commotion attracted other students. Some students even took out their phones and started recording.Yang Xuan\u2019s mother was so overwhelmed with anger that she slapped Jin Yazhen once again and yelled, \u201cYou made our Xuan Xuan borrow money, and then you spent all of it! You\u2019re so young and you already want men?!? If you are so slutty, go and sell yourself! Your p*ssy must be worth a lot of money!\u201d14Yang Xuan\u2019s mother was a fierce middle-aged woman, almost invincible in her neighborhood. It would be too easy for her to deal with a young girl like Jin Yazhen.All the grievances that she had suffered through the ordeal with Xia Xibei suddenly exploded at this moment.The teachers had arrived by now, so she had to restrain herself. But that twenty thousand yuan hurt so much, she simply wanted to kill Jin Yazhen!If it wasn\u2019t for Jin Yazhen, Yang Xuan wouldn\u2019t be in this mess now! Yang Xuan was even disliked by his teachers now!Realizing this, Yang\u2019s mom became even more angry. She wanted to strip all of Jin Yazhen\u2019s clothes off, teach her a real lesson.2It was good that she had a few drops of reason left in her head, however. Aware that she was on school grounds and that couldn\u2019t get too out of line, she only slapped the girl a few more times.In just a short while, Jin Yazhen\u2019s face was as puffy as a pig\u2019s head.2Around Yang\u2019s mom, other people were blushing due to her foul language. Everyone was a student here, but no one said things like this, not even while arguing. People looked really embarrassed.Meanwhile, Jin Yazhen was anxious and in pain, pleading, \u201cI didn\u2019t! Let me go first!\u201dBut Yang Xuan\u2019s mom didn\u2019t let her go so easily. When others rushed forward to save the girl, the older woman flicked her arm again, forcing Jin Yazhen to scream and move along with her, going wherever she went.For a while, the scene was very comical, as if it was straight out of a cartoon.\u201cThe dean is here!\u201d someone shouted, instantly creating a space within the crowd.The dean of teaching rushed over, along with a few teachers. When he saw Yang Xuan\u2019s mother, his face changed immediately, turning red with outrage.\u201cLet go of our student right now!\u201d\u201cMs. Xie?\u201d Teacher Zhang voiced, having come over too.He was stunned at the scene, not having expected Yang Xuan\u2019s mom to find Jin Yazhen so quickly, even if it was all to settle the score. What was even more unexpected was that she was so fierce and tough!Yang Xuan\u2019s father arrived soon after, almost fainting at the scene occurring before him.It was all so embarrassing!2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even more unexpectedly, she made such a big deal out of the entire matter!Looking at his wife\u2019s fierce, unbridled countenance, he had to fight back the urge to pass out right where he was!This was just too embarrassing!\u201cYou\u2019d better let go of our student!\u201d the dean shouted, anxious and furious. \u201cWho on earth are you?!\u201dTheir school was quite a strict one, outsiders not allowed to enter the premises, especially during classes.Teacher Zhang stepped forward and looked at Mr. Yang with an awkward look on his face. \u201cShe is the parent of a student from my class,\u201d he answered, \u201cand the wife of Mr. Yang here.\u201dEveryone turned to Mr. Yang at once, all their eyes shooting him looks that made him feel rather helpless.\u201cLet go of her! What are you even trying to do!\u201dMr. Yang couldn\u2019t put up with it any longer, starting to yell at Mrs. Yang. He had never felt so embarrassed before, but he was utterly ashamed today!\u201cIt was all this little b*tch\u2019s fault! She seduced our Xuan Xuan, and even asked him to borrow money for her! 20,000 yuan!\u201dWhen she mentioned the sum of money, Mrs. Yang became even more agitated.\u201cI did not!\u201d Jin Yazhen grappled with Mrs. Yang\u2019s hand, which was clutching her hair, and screamed, \u201cLet go of me!\u201dAs they looked on at Jin Yazhen\u2019s pathetic, battered countenance, all the students of Third Class were shocked and baffled. The nearby students couldn\u2019t help but inquire about the details of the situation, and soon, they all got to understand what had happened.Everyone looked at Jin Yazhen with complicated feelings in their eyes.\u201cYou\u2019d better let go of her!\u201dMr. Yang couldn\u2019t stand it anymore, dashing forward in an attempt to drag his wife away.\u201cI\u2019m not letting go! She has to return the money! It was her who spent the money, of course she\u2019s the one who has to pay it back!\u201d Mrs. Yang refused to budge on the topic.If she let her go, Jin Yazhen would run away! It was 20,000 yuan that they were owed! Her heart ached at the mere thought of it!\u201cI said let go!\u201d Mr. Yang was even more furious now, slapping Mrs. Yang\u2019s face in an attempt to make her see reason. \u201cAre you insane?!\u201dWith a pow, Mrs. Yang was startled for a moment, then completely stupefied.\u201cHow dare you hit me?! I\u2019m all out for a fight!\u201d3Mrs. Yang finally loosened her grip on Jin Yazhen, pouncing towards Mr. Yang instead, appearing extremely furious.Very soon, both husband and wife were caught up in a scuffle.Jin Yazhen finally escaped the grip of the demon\u2019s claws, in a completely wretched state as fat tears fell from her eyes.As they watched the fight continue between the husband and wife, the looks on the faces of both the dean and the teachers turned worse and worse.5Very soon, squad cars arrived. Only then did the couple come to their senses.Shame on them!3The pair were taken away by the police but talk regarding the matter was far from over.Especially for Jin Yazhen, who was wishing she could bury herself deep in the ground!Mrs. Yang was a mad woman! Why would Yang Xuan even have a mother like her?Other students were trying to comfort her, but they were more curious about the secrets of the matter and couldn\u2019t wait to gossip about it.It was all too exciting!Meanwhile, Yang Xuan was finally spotted.\u201cYang Xuan, was that your parents who were fighting just now?\u201dHis face turned flushed upon hearing that, all of his blood rushing to her face. He had to grind his teeth to keep from doing something he\u2019d regret.\u201cYour parents were incredible, having the guts to fight on school grounds! But is it true that you are in a relationship with Jin Yazhen? And you even borrowed 20,000 yuan? Didn\u2019t you say that your family was rich? Why would you even need to borrow 20,000? You\u2026\u201d\u201cShut the hell up!\u201d Yang Xuan screamed with rage, his face hideous and his eyes ferocious.His schoolmates were frightened, watching in a mixture of fear and confusion as he dashed out.Soon enough, Yang Xuan found Xia Xibei. His boiling rage had cooled down by the time he saw her.He took in a deep breath and started the voice recorder on his phone, only then walking up to Xia Xibei.\u201cCome over here! I need to talk to you about something!\u201d2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40: A Different Xia XibeiLooking at Yang Xuan, who was trying his best to suppress his anger, Xia Xibei raised her brows. \u201cSure, but I can only spare a few minutes.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d Yang Xuan nodded with gritted teeth, leading the way to the exact spot they had been at this morning.\u201cWhy did you look for me?\u201d Xia Xibei asked.Yang Xuan was bewildered as he looked at the calm, unhurried Xia Xibei. Was she really the same person she used to be? Why was she so different now? However, he cast the irrelevant thoughts aside very quickly, drawing in a deep breath to suppress the fury in him. Then he said, \u201cIn fact, we both know that I do not owe you that much money.\u201d\u201cBut you did borrow my money,\u201d Xia Xibei replied with a shrug. \u201cIs that not true?\u201dYang Xuan paused for a second, continuing with his argument, \u201cBut I only borrowed 10,000 from you, not 20,000! You are trying to scam me!\u201d\u201cSo what?\u201d Xia Xibei flashed him a devilish smile. \u201cDo you think you can explain it to the others? Would anyone even believe you now?\u201dHer words delighted Yang Xuan, who planned to continue luring her into saying more.\u201cYou even hit me today!\u201d\u201cSo what if I did? Wasn\u2019t it your fault, for being so vulnerable?\u201dYang Xuan\u2019s face fell. The Xia Xibei standing before him was a complete stranger to him!\u201cBesides, even if these things are true, who would believe your words? Your parents created such a large mess, the whole school knows about it by now. And you\u2019re famous too! How great is that? You should thank me for doing that for you.\u201dXia Xibei\u2019s words greatly infuriated Yang Xuan, who yelled, \u201cIt was all because of you! I\u2019mma kill you!\u201dWhen he thought of the drama that his parents had created, his rage finally erupted, causing him to dart toward Xia Xibei.Unfortunately, before he could even reach her, his knee received a kick from Xia Xibei and he gracelessly landed on the ground, knelt down from the pain.\u201cAhh!\u201dHe let out a miserable scream upon coming into contact with the cemented floor. The color faded fast from his face, the assault making him feel as though his knees had been shattered into a million pieces.Xia Xibei flashed him a small smile. With a simple swing of her leg, she kicked him to the side.\u201cAhh\u2014\u2014!\u201dYang Xuan further fell onto the ground, momentarily rendered immobile.Shock, pain, and anger flooded through him.Xia Xibei was a totally different person now!Nonetheless, he had to take his revenge! The first step was to reveal her true colors!He heaved a sigh of relief as he thought of the cell phone in his pocket. His plan could still work!However, before he could really relax, he saw Xia Xibei walking toward him.\u201cWhat- What more are you- you trying to do?! Don\u2019t come near me!\u201dHe stared at Xia Xibei with terrified eyes, feeling as though she was going to murder him!Xia Xibei\u2019s lips twitched with a ghost of a smile as she crouched down, holding a hand towards him.\u201cDon\u2019t come near me!\u201d He drew in a cold, sharp breath of air, nearly peeing his pants in the process.The next moment, Xia Xibei\u2019s hand reached into his pocket.And then his cell phone was fished out.\u201cWhat are you trying to do?! Give me my phone back! It\u2019s brand new!\u201dWhen Xia Xibei pressed it\u2019s on-button, a voice-recording page appeared on the screen.Xia Xibei smiled. It was just what she had expected. She knew Yang Xuan wouldn\u2019t be so honest.She stopped the recording and deleted the file. After making sure that it couldn\u2019t be recovered, she removed her fingerprint and put the phone back into Yang Xuan\u2019s pocket.Yang Xuan watched all of her actions with jaw-dropping shock, nearly having a meltdown right then and there.How was he going to accuse her of those horrible actions now that the recording was gone?Xia Xibei stood up and looked down at him from above, flashing a malicious smile at him all the while.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. That was only the beginning, there\u2019s more exciting drama coming up next. Let us take things slow~\u201dLooking into her icy eyes, Yang Xuan couldn\u2019t help but shiver.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41: Two-timingAfter saying those fierce words, which terrified Yang Xuan greatly, Xia Xibei calmly left.Before she returned to the classroom, however, she ran into Song Jiaren.Song Jiaren\u2019s expression was very complicated: suspicion, fear, sadness\u2026 So many emotions mixed together, contorting her large face into a mess.Of course, she had heard of the incident with Yang Xuan\u2019s mother, and someone had shown her the recording too. That was why her emotions were so complicated.Yang Xuan was pretty good to her usually, and behaved well, like a mild-mannered gentleman.He had mentioned his parents once before. In his words, his parents had very good personalities. They were gentle with others, and would never dislike her.But today, that impression of goodness had been broken. Yang Xuan\u2019s mom\u2019s ferociousness was more terrifying than that of any thug!Although Song Jiaren was the gang leader\u2019s daughter, and everyone avoided her at school, she was not as fierce as everyone thought she was.\u2014\u2014She had no choice. She was fat, sweated profusely whenever she moved, and sometimes didn\u2019t move at all if she didn\u2019t have to.Then Song Jiaren heard the whole story.After understanding things more clearly, she became disillusioned.How could Yang Xuan have done such a thing?! He had denied borrowing money, then lied about being beaten?!She was devastated, feeling as if her world had been turned upside down.However, after struggling with the situation and feeling sad, she still came to Xia Xibei, because she wanted to understand the whole truth!\u201cYou came?\u201d Xia Xibei didn\u2019t seem to notice Song Jiaren\u2019s reaction. Smilin, she continued, \u201cThen let\u2019s go, I\u2019m ready!\u201d She showed off her backpack, which held all the herbs.\u201cAren\u2019t you going to react at all?\u201d Song Jiaren asked with a frown.\u201cReact?\u201d Xia Xibei was startled for a minute before responding. \u201cOh, you mean that whole thing with Yang Xuan?\u201dSong Jiaren nodded, so Xia Xibei continued, \u201cThere is nothing to react to.\u201dShe shrugged her shoulders, acting as if this was all normal, \u201cAs soon as they said I was a couple with Yang Xuan, I knew what they thought. \u201d\u201cYou\u2019re really not together?\u201d\u201cNo way!\u201d Xia Xibei exclaimed, looking shocked, \u201cI\u2019m not blind! How could I be into him?\u201dBlind\u2026The corner of Song Jiaren\u2019s mouth twitched. Xia Xibei was not blind, only she was the blind one.\u201cBesides, he\u2019s two-timing a bunch of people. I\u2019d be a moron to be into him!\u201d\u201cTwo-timing\u2026 Several people?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Xia Xibei nodded, counting off on her fingers, \u201cI figured there\u2019s at least three or four people!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Song Jiaren shouted, \u201cThree or four people?!\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d Xia Xibei nodded her head, acting as if she didn\u2019t notice Song Jiaren\u2019s emotions and continued, \u201cOther than Jin Yazhen, there are a couple of girls from other schools. Why do you think he needed to borrow so much money?\u201dThese words made the look on Song Jiaren\u2019s face become worse.There were others besides Jin Yazhen? Then what was she?At that moment, all of her feelings dissipated!Seeing Song Jiaren\u2019s vicious look, Xia Xibei smiled internally, becoming very happy.If this had happened a year later, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to make Song Jiaren abandon Yang Xuan so easily.Well, that hadn\u2019t happened yet.Although the current Song Jiaren liked Yang Xuan, she had not yet reached the point where she couldn\u2019t live without him.If Song Jiaren didn\u2019t like Yang Xuan anymore, his life would be much more difficult.\u201cOK. Don\u2019t think too much about it, we\u2019ll deal with the important things first. Let\u2019s go!\u201dXia Xibei began to leave first, heading towards the school gate.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42: Same Last Name, Different TreatmentWhen the students who had not left school yet saw Song Jiaren and Xia Xibei walking together, they were shocked.With those two walking together, the resulting effect was outstanding!One was tall and the other was short, one fat and one thin, one beautiful and one ugly\u2026 The juxtaposition was glaringly strong!The first one they saw was Xia Xibei, who made people feel comfortable.And when they turned their heads, they saw Song Jiaren, which completed the effect.Compared to Song Jiaren, Xia Xibei was prettier,as Song Jiaren was quite scary, visually speaking.\u201cSo, this is a red flower and its green leaves!\u201d\u201cWow, this is too much of a contrast!\u201d\u201cWhat is Song Jiaren doing?\u201d\u201cWho is that beauty next to her? She\u2019s even prettier than Xia Qinghan!\u201dThe looks and whispers of the people around them made Song Jiaren feel upset. The one thing she hated the most in the world was a beautiful woman.When the two of them walked together, they received a lot of attention, but the gazes directed to Song Jiaren were very unfriendly. If she didn\u2019t think that Xia Xibei could help her lose the extra weight she had, she would have turned right around and left.When they reached the entrance, the car sent to pick up Song Jiaren was already waiting.The driver was a little surprised to see that Song Jiaren had brought a beautiful girl along with her. There were no beauties such as Xia Xibei around their young miss!Xia Xibei didn\u2019t give the slightest bit of attention to the driver\u2019s gaze. After saying hello to him, she smiled and said, \u201cUncle, I forgot to buy a washtub. Can we go to Zhonghong Street?\u201dZhonghong Street was a well-known area to shop at. It was near the commercial business district and had everything, including washtubs.\u201cWhat are we buying a washtub for?\u201d Song Jiaren asked.\u201cFor baths!\u201d Xia Xibei replied, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll make sure you see results today.\u201dThe driver watched the two of them, hesitating but deciding not to say anything.Soon enough, the car stopped outside Zhonghong Street, the block forbidding the presence of cars.After they got out, Xia Xibei took Song Jiaren towards a specific store.As they were walking, Xia Xibei suddenly stopped and looked ahead of them.Song Jiaren saw that she had stopped and looked over in the same direction to see what had caught her eye. She saw three girls, one of whom looked very familiar.\u201cHey, isn\u2019t that Xia Qinghan, our school\u2019s beauty queen?\u201dAlthough Song Jiaren wasn\u2019t pretty and didn\u2019t get along that well with other people, even she knew who Xia Qinghan was.After all, the girl was the famous beauty queen of their school!She was good-looking, had a great figure, an excellent family background, aced school, was athletic, and combining all of that with a gentle personality, she always had an overflow of suitors around her. She was a goddess to many guys.She supposedly had an excellent boyfriend too!This made Song Jiaren, who was often ignored and had just been cheated on by a scumbag, quite envious.She hadn\u2019t expected to run into Xia Qinghan here.\u201cDo you know each other?\u201d Song Jiaren asked casually.\u201cNo,\u201d Xia Xibei\u2019s eyes slightly cold, even as they burned with a silent fire.How could she not know her? 20% of the initial pain she had suffered had been at the hands of Yang Xuan, another 10% caused by those irresponsible parents, and the leftover 70% was all due to Xia Qinghan!Song Jiaren didn\u2019t notice the expression in Xia Xibei\u2019s eyes, murmuring to herself, \u201cYes, your last names are both Xia, but you probably wouldn\u2019t know her.\u201dJust because they had the same Xia surname didn\u2019t mean that they had any ties connecting them.Contrary to Xia Qinghan, Xia Xibei didn\u2019t have much going for her other than her appearance. Of course, if one only looked at her face, Xia Xibei was much more beautiful than Xia Qinghan!\u201cHey, what\u2019s going on over there?\u201d Song Jiaren asked, walking ahead in an attempt to sate her curiosity, finally realizing what was happening. \u201cStar scout?\u201dShe watched with surprise as the man took out a business card and gave it to Xia Qinghan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43: We\u2019re Recruiting TraineesZhong Hong Street was at the heart of all the commerce. There were numerous large-scale companies in the vicinity, many of which were entertainment companies.Events were held often here, and people went in droves, star scouts searching for suitable youngsters in the area to join the entertainment industry.Previously, a boy from a neighboring school had been scouted, becoming a celebrity. He wasn\u2019t very famous, but it was exciting enough for the students.Song Jiaren was familiar with this gossip, and although she never had such unrealistic dreams herself, she was envious of those people, nonetheless.And right now, the man standing before Xia Qinghan fit the bill of what the others had described a star scout to look like.She took two steps closer to them, finally able to hear their conversation more clearly.\u201cAre you really a star scout?\u201d the girl beside Xia Qinghan asked in shock and suspicion.\u201cOf course!\u201d The man smiled confidently, continuing, \u201cI am one of the top managers of SY Entertainment, Pan Yan. If you don\u2019t believe me, you could always follow me to my company and have a look around.\u201d As he spoke, he pointed in a specific direction.\u201cI believe you,\u201d Xia Qinghan finally said slowly, \u201cI know someone from SY Entertainment.\u201dThe other two girls looked at her in envy and admiration. She was amazing, even having connections with people from an entertainment company!Xia Qinghan wore a polite smile, but she enjoyed the looks that people were giving her, basking in their attention.\u201cReally?\u201d Pan Yan voiced his surprise, \u201cWho?\u201d\u201cBai Meixue.\u201d\u201cYou know Bai Meixue?!\u201dBefore Pan Yan could get in a word, the two girls shrieked in delight, exclaiming in union, \u201cMy goodness! You know her!\u201dBai Meixue was an actress who would be turning 40 soon, but looked as if she was just over 30, all thanks to her meticulous skincare routine.Aside from that, she had pretty substantial popularity. She had been the main female lead of various modern dramas a few years back but had taken on the big screen in the past few years, both with pretty good results.She was a well-known celebrity to the people of the nation, and a goddess in the eyes of many.In the meantime, she was head of all the female celebrities in SY Entertainment.\u201cShe\u2019s an auntie of mine, she treats me well.\u201dXia Qinghan responded in a reserved manner, but she couldn\u2019t hide the delight and pride shining behind her eyes.Pan Yan was taken aback as well, never having expected this little girl to know Bai Meixue.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you talk about this before?\u201d Liu Zhijing grumbled on her left, \u201cEven we didn\u2019t know that!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to talk about,\u201d Xia Qinghan replied calmly with a smile, \u201cI can\u2019t just go around telling people that we know each other, now can I? That would not be appropriate.\u201d\u201cAiya, that\u2019s too low-key!\u201d Liu Zhijing pouted. \u201cIf I knew a celebrity as big as her, I would be boasting about it left and right, to everyone I knew and everywhere I go!!\u201d\u201cRight! Right!\u201d On her other side, Tao Yueying joined in, \u201cI\u2019m so envious of you! You score well on all the exams, you have good looks, and you know such a famous celebrity\u2026 You\u2019re good at whatever you do, and you have everything you could ask for. You\u2019re winning in life! I\u2019m dying of envy!\u201dAs she took in the undisguised envy on their faces, Xia Qinghan felt joyful and rejuvenated, but masked it all behind serene words, \u201cAiya, it\u2019s not something worth talking about. You shouldn\u2019t tell anyone else either. I prefer to keep a low profile.\u201d\u201cAiya, we know that!\u201d the two replied in girlish tones, clutching onto her hands.Pan Yan kept a straight face as he watched the little girls boasting and flattering among themselves. It was okay for them to have a sense of pride and vanity, as long as they didn\u2019t go overboard.\u201cMiss, I think you would fit within the entertainment industry very well. We are recruiting trainees now, if you are interested?\u201d\u201cTrainee?\u201d\u201cWhy would our Qinghan even need any training? She could debut right away with her current capabilities!\u201d Liu Zhijing retorted.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44: Brainless Boasting\u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d Tao Yueying stated, nodding in agreement. \u201cOur Qinghan is the face of the school! And in addition to her good looks, her results are tip-top, and she has a Grade 10 in piano as well! If she can debut right away, what\u2019s the point of making her a trainee?\u201dOnly when Tao Yueying finished blabbering did Xia Qinghan give her a light tap, telling her to hush.\u201cAiya, you\u2019re exaggerating! I\u2019m not that great, okay?\u201d\u201cHow am I exaggerating? The boys at our school go crazy for you! We settle your breakfast for you every morning, or have you forgotten?\u201d Liu Zhijing flattered her.Every morning, Xia Qinghan\u2019s table would be full of the various breakfasts given to her by her many admirers. Although she had rejected them many times over, many of the boys still hadn\u2019t given up. Eventually, all the food would go into someone else\u2019s stomach.To keep herself in shape, Xia Qinghan dared not eat too much, but the other girls did not have any such worries.\u201cAlright, stop saying that, it\u2019s embarrassing!\u201d Xia Qinghan\u2019s cheeks flushed red, \u201cWe are talking about the trainee matter!\u201dPan Yan smiled indulgently, saying, \u201cBeing a trainee is only the initial phase. Not everyone has to spend that much time on it. Some trainees are outstanding enough that they graduate and debut in just a fortnight.\u201dWhat he didn\u2019t mention was that there were hardly any prodigies like that, even in the entertainment industry, where geniuses were produced in frequent batches.Without a long period of practice, how could one perform with ease, composure and natural elegance on stage?The old industry saying, \u201cIt takes ten years of practice to put on a google one-minute performance on stage,\u201d wasn\u2019t a lie by any stretch of the imagination.\u201cThen our Qinghan will surely be a prodigy who can debut in just a week!\u201d Liu Zhijing replied, singing Xia Qinghan\u2019s praises immediately.Further in the distance, Song Jiaren\u2019s lips twitched, the look on her face not exactly flattering.Although she knew that Xia Qinghan had a few sidekicks that followed her around, she hadn\u2019t expected Liu Zhijing and Tao Yueying to boast about their friend so much!Debut in a week? They didn\u2019t stop to consider Xia Qinghan\u2019s capabilities at all, did they?To be fair, Xia Qinghan was a pretty well-rounded person. She was good-looking and was talented on top of that. However, that talent would fade away in comparison to those of professional artists.What on earth gave them the courage to boast like that?Pan Yan remained unaffected as he listened to these little girls and their brainless boasting.Having worked in the entertainment industry for a long time, he was used to fans flattering and fawning over their idols.Those brainless fans could twist their idols into whatever they wished, taking a \u201cdead-faced, soulless-eyed\u201d look and turning it into \u201caloofness and confidence\u201d. These little girls still had a long way to go if they wanted to reach that level.\u201cWe can only know for sure once the training is done, but I believe that you definitely have the potential to become a famous celebrity.\u201dThe girls\u2019 words didn\u2019t cheer up Xia Qinghan much, but Pan Yan\u2019s words did excite her. He was a professional after all, his words carried much more weight!She had also heard Bai Xuemei say that Pan Yan was indeed a top-notch manager from SY Entertainment. Having been recognized by him, she felt as if she could fly, she was so delighted!\u201cYes, Qinghan! You can do it for sure!\u201d\u201cIf you get rich and famous one day, don\u2019t forget us!\u201dThe two of them made pouting faces at Xia Qinghan, both encouraging and pleading with her.\u201cBut I have to seek permission from my parents\u2026\u201d Xia Qinghan voiced hesitantly, acting restrained.She knew that her parents would support her in whatever she chose to do, but she had to put up a reserved front.Sure enough, Pan Yan knew what she was thinking, and nodded, \u201cOnce you\u2019ve thought about it and talked it all over, you can contact me.\u201d\u201cSure, I\u2019ll do that,\u201d Xia Qinghan reassured him.\u201cThen I\u2019ll stop bothering you for now. I\u2019ll leave first.\u201dPan Yan turned around to leave, but his gaze quickly fixed onto something in the distance.Making a split-second decision, he walked toward a girl with quick, wide strides, holding his name card towards her.\u201cHello! I am Pan Yan, a manager at SY Entertainment. May I know if you have any interest in becoming a celebrity?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45: A Real TreasurePan Yan\u2019s heart thumped wildly in his chest at the sight of the beautiful girl, who had a cool, striking aura about her.He had seen a lot of beauties in the entertainment industry, but this girl could be ranked top among the very best.She wasn\u2019t wearing any makeup at the moment, but that didn\u2019t conceal her beauty in any way. If she had put on makeup, she would certainly be a beautiful female in a TV series!Most importantly, she had a very high malleability.Pan Yan had seen many beauties, but not all of them were made for the camera. However, he could guarantee that this girl would definitely look great on camera!Although she was slim, she wasn\u2019t scrawny!That was the key point!Many female celebrities went through great lengths to lose weight just to achieve such an outcome. After all, one\u2019s figure would be slightly widened on camera.A body shape like hers would be absolutely perfect on camera!She could attract lots of fans just with that face!\u201cSY Entertainment has lots of experience and an abundance of resources. As long as you\u2019re willing to join our company, we could make you a superstar!\u201dPan Yan was quite eager to have her join, as he had ventured out this time just to find great candidates.As the top manager at SY Entertainment, he didn\u2019t have to take this upon himself, but he wasn\u2019t in a good state at the moment.Previously, a B-list celebrity under him, whom he promoted to an A-lister, had walked out on him after managing to curry favor with someone rich!He had sustained a blow because of this matter, which was why he chose to come out on his own to look for new candidates.He had thought Xia Qinghan was good when he first saw her.However, after seeing this girl, he realized that she was even better!He had already started contemplating various ways to polish and promote her.\u201cSuperstar?\u201d Xia Xibei asked, looking at him with raised brows, her lips curled into a cool smile.Pan Yan couldn\u2019t help but inhale sharply. This little girl was extraordinary!With her brows raised, she gave off a whole different aura, one that was very attractive.She was only a girl in her teens, but she had the kind of charm that kept people\u2019s eyes glued to her. That was rare indeed!Most importantly, she wasn\u2019t attractive in the usual way, pompous but cheap. Rather, there was an air of nobility about her that commanded respect from people. She was a real treasure!He would be insane to let go of such a piece of jade, which shone long before it was polished and refined!\u201cYes, you will definitely become a superstar!\u201dDespite having seen many rough seas and strong winds in his life, Pan Yan still got excited when he saw such a great sapling, full of potential.\u201cXia Xibei\u2026\u201dSong Jiaren had returned as well, marveling as she looked at Xia Xibei in great astonishment.Now that she had observed both, she could tell the differences between how Pan Yan treated Xia Xibei and Xia Qinghan.When he met Xia Qinghan earlier, he had offered a passionate invitation, but did not force it.However, when it came to Xia Xibei, excitement was clearly written all over his face.Song Jiaren was delighted.Although she didn\u2019t really like Xia Xibei, she felt pride at Xia Xibei being treated with such enthusiasm by a star scout.\u201cYour name is Xia Xibei, right? If you have any doubts, you could come with me to my company! My colleagues happen to have time at the moment.\u201dSong Jiaren pouted, stating, \u201cShe can\u2019t go with you, we are not free right now.\u201d\u201cOh, really?\u201d Pan Yan voiced, a little disappointed, but he lifted his spirits up right away. \u201cThat\u2019s alright. Visit anytime you\u2019re free.\u201d\u201cIf she joins your company now, would she need to be a trainee first?\u201d Song Jiaren asked, continuing to question him.\u201cYes,\u201d Pan Yan nodded. \u201cHowever, I can arrange your schedule as soon as possible. You could train and perform at the same time!\u201dAs she looked at the earnest Pan Yan, Xia Xibei smiled and nodded, \u201cAlright then, I\u2019ll go to your company on Saturday.\u201d\u201cSaturday? No problem!\u201d Pan Yan exclaimed, thrilled to have gotten her to agree to a visit.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46: DiscriminationXia Xibei remembered Pan Yan, a well-known manager in the entertainment industry. He was known for his outstanding capabilities, as well as his bad luck.He had produced a twenty-year-old A-list celebrity, but unfortunately, she managed to curry favor with someone rich and terminated the contract right after.After that, he didn\u2019t give up, going on to promote Xia Qinghan instead.Under his guidance, Xia Qinghan quickly became a great sensation who was much sought-after.Nonetheless, Xia Qinghan kicked him out once she became famous too.The reason he got terminated was because some artists stepped up and came clean about him sexually assaulting his artists.When it was first revealed, he became a scumbag that everyone abhorred and rebuked!Although they couldn\u2019t find any evidence, his reputation was irreversibly damaged.As for Xia Qinghan, she wasn\u2019t really impacted by the matter. Her character was the daughter of a wealthy, prestigious family, and after combining her own talents with her family\u2019s wealth and power, Pan Yan dared not do her any harm.However, the public still sympathized with her, because she had once been so close to a wolf!Therefore, Xia Qinghan\u2019s popularity rose even after Pan Yan got into trouble.Back then, the topic #my heart aches for Xia Qinghan# trended for quite a few days!However, Xia Xibei did not believe it.She had once rubbed elbows with Pan Yan, and she knew just how capable, honest, and righteous he was. He never demanded his artists attain resources through illicit channels.Unfortunately, such a righteous manager was badly destroyed by Xia Qinghan.Pan Yan had left the entertainment industry and gone missing even before Xia Xibei\u2019s incident.When she first met Pan Yan, Xia Xibei already had a manager, but her career development wasn\u2019t very impressive.At that time, Pan Yan had sighed with regret and said, \u201cIf I were the one who was guiding you, you would have become the queen a long time ago!\u201dIt was because of his words that Xia Xibei managed to pull through the difficulties she encountered in the complicated entertainment industry. She had to prove herself!However, Pan Yan got into trouble soon after.Now that she thought about it, Xia Qinghan might have been there and overheard what he said.Considering Xia Qinghan\u2019s animosity towards her, it wasn\u2019t impossible that she would vent her anger out on Pan Yan.As the thought occurred to her, Xia Xibei offered an even more sincere smile to Pan Yan.\u201cRest assured, I\u2019m free on Saturday, so I\u2019ll be there.\u201d\u201cSure, sure!\u201d Pan Yan nodded immediately. \u201cHow about we exchange our contact information for now?\u201d\u201cNo problem,\u201d Xia Xibei said, taking out her phone and noting down his number.After attaining her information, Pan Yan\u2019s smile turned even brighter. \u201cI\u2019ll wait for you on Saturday then!\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dOnly then did Pan Yan leave, with the bright smile still on his face.\u201cXia Xibei, you\u2019re going to be a celebrity!\u201d Song Jiaren was very excited. She had never expected Pan Yan to hold Xia Xibei in such high regard.When Xia Qinghan said she would consider it, Pan Yan was at ease. He didn\u2019t even get her contact information. However, he took the initiative to request Xia Xibei\u2019s number. That was a world of difference!\u201cYea,\u201d Xia Xibei nodded with a smile, joking, \u201cI\u2019ll sign an autograph for you, then.\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026 Thank you in advance!\u201d Song Jiaren laughed along merrily.It was a fascinating feeling, when someone around you would soon become a celebrity.At that moment, a sarcastic voice cut through their joyful moment.\u201cIs becoming a celebrity that easy? Don\u2019t think that you can become a star just because you have a pretty face! Don\u2019t trip over yourself by then, that will be so humiliating!\u201dXia Xibei and Song Jiaren looked in the direction of the voice, only to see Liu Zhijing staring at them with blazing eyes, her face almost distorted by jealousy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47: Red Flowers and Green LeavesSong Jiaren was not the only one who noticed Pan Yan\u2019s behavior. Xia Qinghan and others had also seen the scene play.Despite her smile, Xia Qinghan was filled with hatred as she gritted her teeth.Pan Yan had been so enthusiastic about Xia Xibei, even taking the initiative to add her contact information\u2026When she compared this with his indifference to her, she felt as if her face had been stepped on!Among the three girls, Liu Zhijing was the first to recognize Xia Xibei\u2019s identity.After the shock wore off, her eyes turned bloodthirsty.Xia Xibei, who usually looked so pathetic and weak, had been discovered by a scout who promised to make her a star? Was this a joke?!So, she made a sarcastic comment, even letting out a cold snort when Xia Xibei looked over.\u201cDon\u2019t think that just because you have a cute face, you can be a star! You should wait and see if you have that blessing\u2026 It\u2019d be awful if you failed very badly!\u201dXia Qinghan\u2019s eyes flickered with concern, tugging on Liu Zhijing\u2019s hand to make her stop saying such things.However, her effort was pretty weak, as she didn\u2019t really want to stop those words from flowing out.\u201cWell, she\u2019s gorgeous! When you\u2019re pretty, you can do whatever you want!\u201dTo their surprise, Song Jiaren had spoken up.She looked at the three of them mockingly and said with disdain, \u201cWhose fault is it that some people just aren\u2019t pretty enough? Do you feel envy, jealousy, hatred?! It will only make you uglier! You can\u2019t get these things with envy, no matter how hard you try!\u201d\u201cYou-!\u201dSong Jiaren had made Liu Zhijing really angry.However, thinking of Jiaren Song\u2019s reputation at school, Liu Zhijing didn\u2019t dare confront her head-on. Who knew if this girl would go crazy?\u201cHah! Some people are so stupid, they don\u2019t know when they have become green leaves!\u201d Liu Zhijing could only spit these words out with exasperation at the lack of someone\u2019s failure.Xia Xibei was already pretty. When Song Jiaren stood next to her, the contrast became even stronger.\u201cAren\u2019t you too confident in yourself?\u201d Xia Xibei finally spoke, looking her up and down. \u201cYou are both green leaves, and green leaves with full marks at that. Where did you get the courage to say those words?\u201dLiu Zhijing\u2019s expression changed as soon as she heard those words.Green leaves with full marks? Was she really ugly?!Xia Qinghan\u2019s smile had also stiffened.Liu Zhijing had an ordinary appearance. Her only advantage over Song Jiaren was that she was very thin.But no matter how thin she was, when she stood beside Xia Qinghan, she was just a green leaf.\u201cSome girls have very good ideas. At least they know they need to find a few green leaves to make themselves seem better,\u201d Xia Xibei said while looking at Xia Qinghan, dragging Tao Yueying into the argument too.Xia Qinghan\u2019s smile disappeared. \u201cHey classmate, did I offend you?\u201dXia Xibei shrugged and smiled innocently, \u201cWhat, did I say something?\u201dTurning to look at Song Jiaren, she asked, \u201cDid I say something just now?\u201d\u201cYeah, did you say anything? I guess some dogs barked first.\u201dSong Jia knew which side to stand on. She had to stand by Xia Xibei\u2019s side, at least before finding out if Xia Xibei had deceived her.Moreover, she still liked Xia Xibei more than the fake Xia Qinghan. At least Xia Xibei looked soothing. The two of them had come out together, so she couldn\u2019t let Xia Xibei be bullied.Liu Zhijing\u2019s face flushed when she heard herself being called a dog, but she did not dare to get angry at Song Jiaren, only able to turn her muzzle towards Xia Xibei.\u201cSome people only have a nice face, but their own parents don\u2019t even like them. So how good can they really be?\u201d Liu Zhijing\u2019s hissed, eyes full of malice.\u201cOh? Not liked by her parents?\u201d Tao Yueying spoke up. Her face was full of curiosity.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48: The JinxLiu Zhijing\u2019s rage increased uncontrollably when she saw Xia Xibei\u2019s calm expression.How could a person whose parents didn\u2019t care for or love her be this proud? So what if she had a pretty face? Did she have the talent? Did she have strength? Could she handle all the pressure and corruption of the entertainment industry?Xia Xibei clearly wasn\u2019t angered by Liu Zhijing\u2019s vicious smile.In fact, they were connected in a way.Liu Zhijing\u2019s father was the older brother of Xia Xibei\u2019s father\u2019s current wife, which meant Xia Songhai was Liu Zhijing\u2019s uncle.The two of them had seen each other at Xia Songhai\u2019s wedding. Back then, they were both young. They didn\u2019t make contact again until high school, but Liu Zhijing had never liked Xia Xibei.In the past, Liu Zhijing felt that Xia Xibei was timid and easy to bully. Her aunt had always hated Xia Xibei\u2019s existence, so Liu Zhijing hated her too.And there was another unknown connection between them.Considering all of this, Liu Zhijing was very upset at seeing Xia Xibei being favored by Pan Yan.\u201cSome people have been treated like a burden by their parents ever since they were young. I don\u2019t even know what to say about this kind of person!\u201dTao Yueying agreed, echoing, \u201cA burden? What do you mean?\u201d\u201cJust unliked and unloved. Almost tossed into the garbage recycling bin as garbage!\u201d Liu Zhijing crowed, showing a malevolent smile.\u201cReally? Like garbage?\u201d\u201cOf course! She was treated like a jinx! Her parents divorced because of her!\u201d\u201cWhoa, a jinx?!\u201d Tao Yueying was adding fuel to the fire, paving the way for Liu Zhijing to reveal more details about Xia Xibei.\u201cYes, otherwise her parents wouldn\u2019t have divorced! Neither of them wanted her after the divorce either\u2026\u201dLiu Zhijing and Tao Yueying continued to talk back and forth, looking at Xia Xibei as if she was garbage.Xia Qinghan\u2019s heart surged with pride as she listened to their words. Even if Xia Xibei was favored by Pan Yan, how could she compare to her? They were on completely different levels.Her parents despised her, and she was treated like a jinx\u2026 How dare she be a star?!\u201cYou-!\u201dSong Jiaren was angered by their words.How could these people be so shameless!Could an innocent child like Xia Xibei control something like a divorce?Song Jiaren didn\u2019t know much about Xia Xibei\u2019s life story until now, but she couldn\u2019t help feeling sorry for her.Before she could speak up, however, she was stopped by Xia Xibei.Song Jiaren turned around to look back at her, shaking a little bit. Xia Xibei\u2019s gaze was calm, but it made one feel cold inside.Liu Zhijing was smug, seeing that Xia Xibei was about to talk. She hadn\u2019t said anything wrong, so had nothing to worry about!Xia Xibei showed a wicked smile, slowly speaking, \u201cAccording to Article X of our country\u2019s Law on the Protection of Minors, abandoning a young, ill, or incapable minor is a crime of abandonment. Those who committed such a heinous crime shall be sentenced to a fixed-term imprisonment of no more than two years\u2026\u201dXia Xibei\u2019s words made Liu Zhijing\u2019s eyes get bigger and bigger, just as she was beginning to feel a little flustered.What could she possibly mean?\u201cWhen I was eight years old, my parents gave up on raising me. If I were to sue them, they would be in jail now.\u201d Xia Xibei\u2019s smile deepened, \u201cI used to think that no matter what had happened, they were my parents, so i should forgive and forget. I didn\u2019t want to make such a big fuss. But now that you\u2019ve reminded me, I should ask them for alimony!\u201d\u201cWho\u2026 who reminded you! What are you going on about!\u201d Liu Zhijing widened her eyes in fear.She didn\u2019t know about all of this. If Xia Xibei really did this, she\u2019d be cussed to death!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49: Who\u2019s the Real Jinx\u201cAs for that talk of me being a jinx, I\u2019d better return it to you!\u201dXia Xibei\u2019s smile remained unfaltering. She took a step forward, which made Liu Zhijing recoil in fear.Xia Qinghan and Tao Yueying retreated right alongside her.\u201cPu\u2014!\u201dOff to the side, Song Jiaren couldn\u2019t help but burst out in laughter.When she finally came to her senses, Xia Qinghan was angry and frustrated. How could she be frightened by Xia Xibei?!\u201cYou are the jinx!\u201d Liu Zhijing held her neck stiffly straight and cursed, her face flushed red. \u201cYou are the jinx!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the jinx? Whom did I influence?\u201d Xia Xibei asked, her lips curled into a smile.\u201cYour parents only became rich after getting divorced. you brought bad luck to them before!\u201d Liu Zhijing declared in a loud voice.However, Xia Xibei was only amused by her words.\u201cHahaha\u2026 You are so much more foolish than I thought!\u201d she laughed. \u201cThey got rich after the divorce because they weren\u2019t meant to be together. What does their financial state have to do with me, a poor, little child? If what you said is true, aren\u2019t you a worse jinx than I am? Your parents didn\u2019t get rich either, after all.\u201dSong Jiaren laughed upon hearing Xia Xibei\u2019s words, \u201cThis is the first time I have heard such a saying! If parents don\u2019t get rich, it\u2019s because the child has brought them bad luck! In that case, the best way to get rich quick is to not have children!\u201dEven strangers passing by laughed when they heard those words.\u201cThey have done such careful research? Well, I have definitely learnt something!\u201d a girl in her twenties told her companion. \u201cThere are so many poor people in our country, so all of their children must be jinxes.\u201d\u201cApologies, I\u2019m also one of the jinxes,\u201d the girl beside her mocked.The taunting of the onlookers made Liu Zhijing extremely embarrassed, her face turning beet red.She glared at Xia Xibei with anger and shame, fighting back the urge to bite her!She didn\u2019t know when Xia Xibei had become this quick-witted and eloquent, because before, you couldn\u2019t get her to talk even if you beat her with a stick.\u201cI feel that you\u2019re more of a jinx than I am. Your younger brother\u2026 he must have turned sick because of your influence, didn\u2019t he?\u201dHer words made Liu Zhijing\u2019s heart skip a beat, her face turning very pale.Her brother was eight years younger than her, the baby of the family. After the birth of her younger brother, her parents and the elderly members of the family started to like him better, favoring him over her.A few years ago, when her parents weren\u2019t around, her young brother caught a very high fever. She didn\u2019t report the matter to her parents, hiding herself away instead.By the time her parents had noticed the situation, her brother\u2019s fever had gotten so severe that his brain suffered irreversible damage. He was slightly mentally retarded now.It was a disreputable matter. Her heart almost stopped beating when she heard Xia Xibei reveal it in public.\u201cYou, you are talking nonsense!\u201d she growled in anger.\u201cIf it was all nonsense, why were you so afraid just now?\u201d Xia Xibei\u2019s smile turned even more innocent, even as her words dripped with poison.\u201cHow does that saying go? \u2018Fierce in appearance but faint at heart.\u2019 Isn\u2019t that it?\u201d Song Jiaren added.Xia Qinghan and Tao Yueying couldn\u2019t help but look at Liu Zhijing, wondering what her next move would be.\u201cHow dare you talk nonsense. I\u2019m going to tear your mouth apart!\u201d Liu Zhijing shouted with fury, panic radiating off of her. She was so furious that she dashed toward Xia Xibei immediately.However, before she could get to Xia Xibei, she was stopped by Song Jiaren.With a swing of her arm, Song Jiaren let a hard slap fly across her face.\u2014Pow!She was clearly very strong! The imprint of her palm appeared on Liu Zhijing\u2019s cheek right away, becoming more and more prominent as she swayed due to the force of the hit.Liu Zhijing held her cheek and burst into tears.\u201cHow could you hit her?!\u201d Tao Yueying rebuked, panic evident in her voice. This situation had gotten out of control.\u201cAre you blind?\u201d Song Jiaren dusted off her hands and stood with hands on her hips and disgust plainly showing on her face. \u201cI\u2019m standing right here and you\u2019re trying to bully my people. Did you think I was dead or something?!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50: My Hot TemperSong Jiaren\u2019s brutal, formidable look finally made them remember her reputation in school.Who in Qing Ye High School hadn\u2019t heard Song Jiaren\u2019s name?The contrast between her graceful, delicate name and her big, robust build was too stark to not notice! Moreover, between her fierce, uncompromising style and her rather disputable background\u2026 Her name made people tremble with fear!\u201cHow dare you bully my people right in front of me\u2026 Did you really think I was dead?!\u201dSong Jiaren stood in front of the, with an intimidating ferocity, her powerful aura making the three of them shudder.Xia Qinghan held Liu Zhijing up and coughed softly, \u201cThis isn\u2019t that big of a deal. We are all schoolmates, so let\u2019s not let these things cause disharmony among us.\u201d\u201cHa!\u201dSong Jiaren\u2019s lips twitched and she couldn\u2019t help but sneer, disgust evident on her face. Her impression of Xia Qinghan kept getting worse and worse.Previously, Song Jiaren only disliked Xia Qinghan because of her good looks, but as she took in what she was saying now, she found her very abhorrent.When they didn\u2019t want to fight her, they were all schoolmates. Yet, when Liu Zhijing was saying such awful things just now, she hadn\u2019t stepped forward and said a word.\u2014What a hypocrite!She was what people would call a \u201cwhite lotus,\u201d wasn\u2019t she?\u201cAlright, we have something else to do, so let\u2019s just go.\u201dXia Xibei stepped forward and tugged on Song Jiaren\u2019s hand, leading her in the opposite direction of Xia Qinghan and the other two girls.\u201cWhy shall we be the ones to go?!\u201d Song Jiaren argued reluctantly, \u201cThese b*tches are way too disgusting to leave alone! Why must we keep quiet about the truth while they simply curse other people out? I won\u2019t tolerate them!\u201dSong Jiaren thought Xia Xibei was too easy to bully.If they had been daring enough to say such things to her face, she would have slapped them many times by now!\u201cEnough! Is it fun to hit people on the street?\u201d Xia Xibei asked as she walked away without turning back. \u201cSince we know just how despicable they are, there\u2019s nothing much to talk to them about. Wouldn\u2019t we just be downgrading ourselves if we do so?\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dXia Xibei applied some delicate force and led Song Jiaren away.They didn\u2019t have to rush to deal with them, there would be much more interesting drama coming up soon enough.\u201cThey were too much!\u201d Tao Yueying stated indignantly.If it wasn\u2019t for Song Jiaren\u2019s ferocity, she would have dashed forth and taught Xia Xibei a lesson!Watching Xia Xibei and Song Jiaren\u2019s backs as they left, Xia Qinghan couldn\u2019t help but bite her lip, her eyes blazing with anger and hatred.Although it was their first meeting, Xia Xibei caused her to feel intimidated. Both her looks and her style alarmed her.Tao Yueying held Liu Zhijing\u2019s hand, looking exasperated as she continued, \u201cThey were too much! They hit you even after scolding you!\u201d\u201cI will not forgive them!\u201d Liu Zhijing vowed, equally resentful.\u201cIn fact, we are all schoolmates. It would be best if we could get along with them,\u201d Xia Qinghan told them gently.\u201cWhat do you mean get along!\u201d Liu Zhijing touched the imprint of the palm on her face and said through gritted teeth, \u201cThey defamed me so badly! I will not rest until I have my justice against them!\u201dShe was so furious, as though she wasn\u2019t the one who had called Xia Xibei a jinx in the first place.Xia Qinghan was delighted, giving up trying to persuade Liu Zhijing soon enough. \u201cAlright, but don\u2019t think too much about it. Let\u2019s go buy some clothes.\u201d\u201cFine\u2026\u201dOn the other side, Song Jiaren was displeased after being dragged away, demanding, \u201cWhy won\u2019t you let me teach them a lesson?\u201d\u201cIs teaching them a lesson more important than losing weight?\u201d Xia Xibei countered, continuing to walk forward while holding onto her.\u201cBoth are important! With my hot temper, I could never put up with such b*tches!\u201d Song Jiaren informed her unhappily. \u201cBut honestly, aren\u2019t you angry?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s there to be angry about?\u201d Xia Xibei\u2019s pace was leisurely, never faltering despite the profound words coming out of her mouth. \u201cWhat influence can those unimportant people have over me?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51: CousinsSong Jiaren looked Xia Xibei from head to toe with a calculating glance, seeing no signs of anger in her.\u201cYou really aren\u2019t mad?\u201dIf someone had said things like that about her, she would have beaten them to death by now!\u201cI\u2019m really not,\u201d Xia Xibei\u2019s eyes gleamed with a smile. \u201cTheir opinions are\u2026 irrelevant.\u201dCompared to being abused by netizens in her past life and the misery of being cursed and boycotted, their words were a piece of cake to deal with.Song Jiaren looked at her with a frown, seemingly exasperated by her indifference. \u201cYou will be bullied to death if you continue this way!\u201d\u201cRight! If you weren\u2019t there with me today, I would have been bullied,\u201d Xia Xibei looked at her with a smile, her eyes shimmering brightly.Song Jiaren\u2019s face turned red under the stare Xia Xibei was giving her.She averted her eyes in embarrassment and coughed softly. \u201cIt\u2019s just because you are an easy target for bullies!\u201d\u201cThat is why I have to thank you!\u201d Xia Xibei said sincerely, her smile wide.Although Song Jiaren didn\u2019t have a good reputation at school, she was a very adorable little girl indeed. A nice girl like her shouldn\u2019t be deceived by Yang Xuan anymore!\u201cActually, Liu Zhijing has a reason to dislike me,\u201d Xia Xibei remarked suddenly.\u201cOh? What\u2019s her reason?\u201d\u201cYang Xuan is her cousin.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d exclaimed in Song Jiaren shock, \u201cCousins?!\u201d\u201cYes. Their mothers are cousins, so they get along very well.\u201dXia Xibei didn\u2019t know either until recently. Only then did she begin to understand why Yang Xuan would even bother to pursue the introverted, quiet girl that she had once been.In fact, if they were to be precise, Liu Zhijing and Xia Xibei were cousins too, although very distant ones at that.Liu Zhijing\u2019s aunt didn\u2019t like Xia Xibei, who was her stepdaughter. Even though they had no direct interactions and seldom met each other, Xia Xibei\u2019s existence was still an eyesore to her.Knowing this, Liu Zhijing bullied Xia Xibei to gain her aunt\u2019s favor. The more miserable Xia Xibei\u2019s life was, the happier they were!\u201cThey are cousins?!\u201d Song Jiaren was still taken aback by the matter. \u201cYou are kidding, right?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of telling you such a joke?\u201d Xia Xibei raised her brows. \u201cI suppose Liu Zhijing got to know about what happened to Yang Xuan\u2019s family. That\u2019s why she had so much hostility towards me.\u201dIn fact, Liu Zhijing and her mates didn\u2019t know about it at all. They had come out right after classes ended and didn\u2019t get to witness the drama in time. Liu Zhijing\u2019s hostility toward Xia Xibei was long-standing, although they didn\u2019t have much opportunity for interaction.\u201cThey were too much, weren\u2019t they?\u201d Song Jiaren asked indignantly. \u201cIt was all Yang Xuan\u2019s family\u2019s fault! How dare she find a reason to blame you! Moreover, Yang Xuan isn\u2019t even a good person! Not only did he not return the money he had borrowed, he even had several girlfriends at once! A real scumbag, indeed!\u201d As she spoke, Song Jiaren got angrier and angrier.Her relationship with Yang Xuan had begun not long ago, so she was still far from having profound feelings for him. That was why she could quickly untangle herself from the relationship, right after the incident happened.If they had been together for a year or two, Yang Xuan would certainly deceive a naive little girl like Song Jiaren with his scheming tactics, tricking her into thinking that she couldn\u2019t live without him.\u201cYes, Yang Xuan is a scumbag! Besides, those relatives of his are also no good!\u201d Xia Xibei nodded in agreement. \u201cA family like that could never raise a good child.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right!\u201d Song Jiaren agreed vehemently.\u201cBut Jiaren, you are different,\u201d Xia Xibei said, changing the subject swiftly, \u201cYour parents must be very good people!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52: We Are Here to Deliver FoodXia Xibei\u2019s words startled Song Jiaren. \u201cWhat\u2026do you mean?\u201d\u201cI think your parents must be great!\u201dSong Jiaren\u2019s face turned gloomy, asking, \u201cHaven\u2019t you heard about my family?\u201d\u201cI have,\u201d Xia Xibei nodded.\u201cThen what did you mean by that? Were you mocking me?\u201d Song Jiaren demanded, her face twisting with rage.As far as the students knew, Song Jiaren\u2019s father was the chief of a gang, a man that couldn\u2019t be messed with.Was Xia Xibei being sarcastic by calling her parents good people?\u201cWhy would I?\u201d Xia Xibei flashed her an indulgent smile. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t experienced such pointless rumors. I was called a jinx just a while ago, remember?\u201dIn her first life, Xia Xibei believed the sayings about the Song family too. After all, Song Jiaren was too ferocious. This time, however, she wouldn\u2019t be so ignorant.\u201cYou\u2019re a very adorable girl who\u2019s loyal to her friends, so your parents must be great people too! As for the rumors, I\u2019m sure people are clueless. They don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about.\u201dSong Jiaren\u2019s cheeks turned red as she met that sincere gaze and heard those enthusiastic words.\u201cYou, you\u2026 How, how am I adorable!\u201d This was the very first time someone had called her adorable, causing Song Jiaren to sputter. Nonetheless, she felt a stream of warmth flowing within her, as though she was being soaked in warm water. It was very soothing.\u201cYou really are adorable!\u201d Xia Xibei insisted, \u201cAnd I assure you, once you lose some weight, you\u2019ll be a great beauty!\u201dXia Xibei had met Song Jiaren\u2019s mother before and she was a true beauty. It was a pity that Song Jiaren was overweight, even her facial features were indiscernible.\u201cReally?\u201d Song Jiaren asked, her face flushed red.As far as girls were concerned, recognition from people of the same gender was of greater importance than that from anyone else, especially from beauties like Xia Xibei. The joy Song Jiaren felt when being called a beauty by her almost made her soar into the sky!\u201cOf course! I wouldn\u2019t lie to you! Alright, let\u2019s go back as soon as we can, and I\u2019ll show you some results tonight!\u201dXia Xibei held onto Song Jiaren and they found a store that sold bathtubs soon enough. After making the payment, they told the store owner to send the bathtub to the house. Only then did the two of them leave Zhong Hong Avenue.Upon reaching home, Xia Xibei began to prepare some herbs. Very soon, however, there was a knock on the door.\u201cI think the bathtub is here!\u201d Xia Xibei called out.However, she was startled when the door was opened.\u201cWho are you?\u201dStanding in front of her were two young men dressed in suits, each of them carrying a lunchbox in their hands.\u201cHello, Ms. Xia. We are here to deliver your food,\u201d the two of them replied respectfully, holding back the urge to glance around the narrow, dim little room.\u201cDeliver food?\u201d Song Jiaren approached them. \u201cWhoa, since when have food couriers started dressing people so formally?\u201d Their attire made them look like office workers. Did all food couriers dress like that nowadays?The two of them did not get angry despite being mistaken for food couriers. Rather, they smiled and asked, \u201cMay we go inside?\u201d\u201cWho sent you here?\u201d Xia Xibei didn\u2019t budge, but already had an idea in the back of her mind.\u201cIt was Mr. Qiao who sent us.\u201dJust as expected!Xia Xibei kept quiet for a while, eventually nodding, \u201cAlright then, come inside.\u201d\u201cNo problem!\u201dThe two of them heaved a sigh of relief, feeling the tension in the air disappear. They felt so much more relaxed now. As she watched them opening the lunchboxes, revealing the cuisine inside, Song Jiaren\u2019s eyes grew wider and wider.\u201cMy goodness! This is too much! Are you feeding pigs?!\u201dThe amount of food could feed at least four to five people!\u201cEnjoy your meal!\u201dAfter properly placing the lunchboxes, the two of them offered a light bow and left in a hurry.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53: A Men\u2019s ProblemSong Jiaren was even more shocked when she saw the lunchboxes.\u201cThis is food from Jia Yao!\u201d she exclaimed, her face full of surprise. \u201cThis must have cost at least a few thousand!\u201dJia Yao was a well-known restaurant. Their dishes were delicious, but their prices weren\u2019t very affordable. Song Jiaren liked the food from this restaurant, but why would anyone deliver such expensive food to Xia Xibei?Song Jiaren knew Xia Xibei\u2019s life story. Even if she hadn\u2019t before, she understood after Liu Zhijing\u2019s explanation.Xia Xibei\u2019s parents didn\u2019t love her, so she lived on her own and worked to make money for herself.In that case, how could Xia Xibei have afforded such expensive food?\u201cIt was sent by a wealthy patient I helped before,\u201d Xia Xibei explained, her expression not changing. She hadn\u2019t exactly lied. Qiao Yanjue was a patient she had once saved.\u201cWow, so rich!\u201d Song Jiaren widened her eyes. \u201cWhat was he sick from?\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t tell anyone!\u201d Xia Xibei warned, suddenly turning mysterious.\u201cI\u2019m not the gossipy kind!\u201d Song Jiaren patted her chest.\u201cIt was\u2026 the most insufferable problem for men.\u201d\u201cA problem for men\u2026 Im- impotence?!\u201dJiaren Song took a breath, hurriedly covering her mouth.\u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone!\u201d Xia Xibei repeated.\u201cOkay! I will never tell anyone!\u201d Song Jiaren nodded quickly, sympathizing with the man named Qiao.As a man, if his male ability had something wrong with it, then was he still a man?\u201cHow is he now?\u201d she asked anxiously.\u201cHe is fine now, of course!\u201d Xia Xibei patted her chest and said. \u201cAs soon as I worked on him as an expert, there were no more problems!\u201dSong Jiaren looked at her with surprise and a little bit of admiration, \u201cThat\u2019s amazing!\u201d\u201cOf course! So, don\u2019t worry. Your problem is only a small one.\u201dSong Jiaren felt more confident hearing her say this. \u201cShould we start now?\u201d she asked eagerly.\u201cLet\u2019s eat first. I\u2019m also hungry.\u201dXia Xibei only had a bread roll for lunch, so she was starving. If the food was here, why not eat it?\u201cOK. Let\u2019s eat! But\u2026 wouldn\u2019t I get fat?\u201d Song Jiaren looked at the food, coveting it but trying hard to resist. She would definitely gain weight if she ate all this!\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I will help you lose weight if you get fat!\u201d Xia Xibei took out utensils and put them into her hand. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe me?\u201d\u201cI do!\u201d Song Jiaren nodded. \u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cNo buts. Let\u2019s eat!\u201dXia Xibei sat down and started to feast, nodding with satisfaction as she ate.Sure enough, there were advantages to the expensive prices. These meals did taste really good.Song Jiaren was tempted by the food, but she forced herself to stop after eating only some.Then her eyes grew bigger.Xia Xibei had finished all of the leftover food, unable to even close her mouth.What the\u2026? How did Xia Xibei eat all of that?!Song Jiaren ate only a single portion and there was enough food left over for a few more people, but it was all eaten by Xia Xibei!Jeez, was her stomach a black hole?!\u201cWhat\u2026 Aren\u2019t you stuffed?\u201dSong Jiaren looked at her with a confused expression.\u201cNot stuffed at all,\u201d Xia Xibei smiled, \u201cBut I\u2019m fine.\u201dHer body wasn\u2019t in great condition yet. She still needed a lot of nutrition.She could handle hunger, but she would also eat this much if she could.Song Jiaren was impressed, noting that Xia Xibei did not seem to have a problem.After the meal, the washtub was delivered.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54: Don\u2019t Treat Me Like A FoolThe next morning, Xia Xibei returned to school refreshed after her morning exercises.As soon as she got to the school entrance, she saw Song Jiaren rush over to her in excitement.\u201cBei Bei!\u201dSong Jiaren gave Xia Xibei a hug. Her name also went from the unfamiliar whole name to the intimate Bei Bei.Song Jiaren\u2019s excitement was beyond words. When she got up this morning, she found her clothes were drenched in sweat, but she felt really good.After taking a shower and weighing herself, she was stunned!In just one night, she had lost three jin! Three jin! She couldn\u2019t lose one jin even after jogging for days! But she had gotten results like this after just a 20-minute medicinal bath!As she slept last night, her body had been detoxing automatically. Now she felt as light as a bird!Xia Xibei really knew her stuff! She wanted to hug her and turn in circles!Even though three jin wasn\u2019t much to her sizable figure, it made her see hope! She really could be skinny!\u201cWell, don\u2019t get so excited. You\u2019ll be even thinner in the future,\u201d Xia Xibei patted her arm, walking ahead with a smile.There were quite a few students at school in the morning, all of them surprised by the intimate demeanor of the two of them.When did Xia Xibei get so friendly with Song Jiaren?At the school gate, Yang Xuan walked in with a haggard face. Yesterday, his parents had been taken to the police precinct and had to be detained for a few days. Even though it was just a few days, it had been a huge blow to Yang Xuan.He actually didn\u2019t want to come to school at all. After all, this was very embarrassing, since everyone must be discussing the matter.However, if he didn\u2019t come to school, what would Song Jiaren do? He couldn\u2019t give up on Song Jiaren.However, he didn\u2019t think that as soon as he got to school, he would see Song Jiaren and Xia Xibei acting so affectionate.This made him panic.Xia Xibei wouldn\u2019t tell Song Jiaren about their business, would she? If Song Jiaren knew he was two-timing her, he\u2019d be over! Sister Jiaren of Qing Ye High School wasn\u2019t a good person to anger! No! Absolutely not!Thinking of this, he went to look for Song Jiaren right away.Jiaren Song was so happy because she had lost a few jin, but when she turned around and saw Yang Xuan, her face suddenly became gloomy.\u201cJia Jia,\u201d Yang Xuan said, looking affectionate, \u201cI have something to tell you.\u201d\u201cWhat is there to say?\u201d Song Jiaren asked, her expression ugly.In fact, she still liked Yang Xuan. After all, he treated her well and was the first boy to pursue her, making him even more special. However, her heart hardened, thinking of what Xia Xibei told her about Yang Xuan\u2019s behavior.\u201cIt\u2019s about yesterday,\u201d he explained, his face bitter.\u201cYesterday?\u201d Song Jiaren\u2019s face got dark. \u201cI know about yesterday. You don\u2019t have to tell me anything.\u201d\u201cNo! What you saw wasn\u2019t true!\u201d Yang Xuan said anxiously, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like what you saw at all!\u201d\u201cNot like what?\u201d Song Jiaren looked at him head-on. \u201cYou didn\u2019t borrow Bei Bei\u2019s money and tried not to pay it back? You weren\u2019t two-timing people? Your parents didn\u2019t make a mess at school because of this?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Yang Xuan was speechless.Before he could continue to explain, Song Jiaren shook her fist at him. \u201cDon\u2019t treat me like a fool! I won\u2019t deal with you now, but If you ever show up near me in the future, I won\u2019t let you off so easily!\u201dThen she turned and left.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55: What\u2019s the Next Move?Yang Xuan was very anxious. Although he didn\u2019t like Song Jiaren, he couldn\u2019t afford to give up the benefits that came with her.There were many girls in school, and there wasn\u2019t a shortage of pretty or wealthy girls either.However, those girls wouldn\u2019t necessarily like him. His tricks might not work with them. Song Jiaren was fat and ugly, which made her the easiest target around.But now that Xia Xibei had drawn Song Jiaren to her side, what would he do?Yang Xuan was so troubled that he didn\u2019t even notice people pointing at him and making comments.Right after returning to the classroom, his phone vibrated. He took it out for a look, seeing it was a message from Liu Zhijing.Yang Xuan agreed to Liu Zhijing\u2019s suggestion to meet up. Right after morning class ended, he went up to the rooftop, which was their secret meeting spot.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you and Xia Xibei?\u201dUpon arriving, Liu Zhijing immediately began questioning him with a cold, hard face.\u201cHow do I know what\u2019s wrong with that b*tch!\u201d Yang Xuan shouted, equally angry and frustrated.All the trouble and suffering he had gone through these past two days was all thanks to Xia Xiibei!His reputation was ruined, and his parents had been detained. Also, they even paid back 20,000 dollars! When he had only borrowed 10,000!Most importantly, Xia Xibei had built a rapport with Song Jiaren!\u201cWeren\u2019t you getting along with her? How did it all turn out like this?\u201dLiu Zhijing had only heard about what happened to Yang Xuan yesterday when she returned to the school this morning.The news had surprised her a lot.Yang Xuan and Xia Xibei were a couple obviously, so how did the matter even turn out so badly?Sure enough, Liu Zhijing knew about Yang Xuan\u2019s relationship with Xia Xibei. After all, she had put in such a great deal of effort into it.After getting together with Yang Xuan, Xia Xibei had to work harder to earn a living. The only free time she had left had to be spent with Yang Xuan as well, which left her even less time to study.In other words, Xia Xibei\u2019s situation would continue getting worse. At least that was Liu Zhijing\u2019s aim.Who would have expected things to take such a drastic turn after just one day?Yang Xuan was the one getting embarrassed now, along with those strange parents of his!\u201cHow would I know?!\u201d Yang Xuan demanded, \u201cYesterday, she wanted to break up with me all of a sudden, and even made me pay her back. She even beat me up!\u201d\u201cBeat you up?\u201d Liu Zhijing asked with shock, \u201cHow did she even do that?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know when that lil\u2019 b*tch got all that prowess! Most importantly, she denied having done it afterwards!\u201dWhen he recounted what had happened, Yang Xuan felt the oppressive feeling in his chest intensify.This was the first time he had got beaten up! And no one believed him about it in the end!\u201cShe has such prowess?\u201d Liu Zhijing was stunned as well.Xia Xibei had been such an easy target for bullies! How did she change into a whole different person within such a short time?As she recalled how Xia Xibei had bickered with her yesterday, Liu Zhijing understood it all.\u201cXia Xibei has been fawning over Song Jiaren now, are you aware of that?\u201dIt must have been Song Jiaren who gave Xia Xibei such bravery and confidence!\u201cI saw it just now,\u201d Yang Xuan said with worry. \u201cAnd she even told Song Jiaren lots of bad things about me!\u201d\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d\u201cSong Jiaren knew about me having several girlfriends at once now.\u201d Yang Xuan\u2019s face was ashen gray.\u201cWhat?\u201d Liu Zhijing asked, startled. Continuing with a frown, she prodded, \u201cWhat was Song Jiaren\u2019s reaction after that?\u201d\u201cShe asked me not to look for her anymore, Otherwise, she won\u2019t have any mercy on me.\u201d Yang Xuan\u2019s shoulders hunched as he talked. \u201cWhat should I do now?\u201dHe was reluctant to leave Song Jiaren\u2026 and the wealth that she represented.\u201cShe didn\u2019t hit or scold you?\u201d Liu Zhijing asked.\u201cNo,\u201d Yang Xuan shook his head.Liu Zhijing\u2019s eyes lit up suddenly, exclaiming, \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, things are very easy to settle!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56: Put Up A Heroic Show\u201cEasy to settle?\u201d Yang Xuan looked at her with doubt and a little bit of displeasure. \u201cHow can it still be easy to settle at this point of time!\u201d\u201cAre you stupid!\u201d Liu Zhijing berated him, \u201cYou\u2019re not a girl, that\u2019s why you\u2019re clueless. But I know! If Song Jiaren reacted that way, it means she still has feelings for you!\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Yang Xuan asked, even more puzzled than before.\u201cIf she had no feelings for you at all, she would have sent someone to teach you a lesson by now!\u201d Liu Zhijing explained. \u201cTherefore, there is still a chance to turn things around!\u201dAs he listened to her, Yang Xuan came to his senses as well, beaming with surprise.\u201cYes! You must be right!\u201dAlthough he didn\u2019t like Song Jiaren, thinking she was too fat and revolting, he understood her character regardless. He knew that she was quite kind-hearted and gentle. In fact, she wasn\u2019t really as ferocious and evil as how people described her.Therefore, he just had to take advantage of that, and things might turn around for him!\u201cBut\u2026 what am I supposed to do?\u201d Yang Xuan asked, troubled once again.\u201cIt\u2019s simple!\u201d Liu Zhijing flashed a cunning smile. \u201cWe could put up a heroic show!\u201d\u201cA heroic show?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Liu Zhijing was thrilled. \u201cIf you rescue her when she\u2019s in danger, she will certainly become hell-bent on staying with you! Once she becomes obsessed with you again, she won\u2019t take Xia Xibei\u2019s words seriously anymore!\u201dLiu Zhijing was a girl, so she knew that some girls became blind once they fell in love. By then, nothing from the outside world could influence them anymore.\u201cBut, what danger can there be?\u201d Yang Xuan was still helpless. \u201cDon\u2019t forget that she\u2019s much more capable than I am!\u201dPutting aside Song Jiaren\u2019s martial strength, her size alone was enormous. Who would be foolish enough to even lay a finger on her?\u201cAre you stupid or what?\u201d Liu Zhijing asked in frustration, \u201cCan\u2019t you just create some danger yourself?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201d Yang Xuan hesitated. \u201cThat isn\u2019t easy though!\u201dSong Jiaren\u2019s father was the well-known head of a gang in their area, so who would dare to harm his daughter?\u201cCome on, just how powerful can the Song family be? They\u2019re not invincible!\u201d Liu Zhijing remarked contemptuously.Even though the Songs were renowned, they still had a long way to go to gain real prestige and influence in this world! It was only because the place wasn\u2019t big that the Songs could behave so rampantly.\u201cEven if they aren\u2019t invincible, there\u2019s no way we could do it,\u201d Yang Xuan argued, brows deeply furrowed. \u201cWe can\u2019t find anyone here!\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ever use your brain?!\u201d Liu Zhijing shot back, looking at him in disgust. \u201cWe can find people somewhere else if we can\u2019t find them here!\u201d\u201cWhere?\u201d\u201cIf we can\u2019t find people in our area, we can go to other areas! The Songs can\u2019t be that influential, can they?\u201dLooking at Liu Zhijing\u2019s confident manner, Yang Xuan felt reassured once again.After discussing the matter and deciding on their next moves, they went downstairs for classes.On her way back to the classroom, Liu Zhijing passed by the third class of sophomore year and caught sight of Xia Xibei.She couldn\u2019t help but sneer. Once they regained Song Jiaren\u2019s favor, Xia Xibei would lose her support! Then she would see whether Xia Xibei could keep behaving arrogantly!As she recalled the slap that Song Jiaren gave her yesterday, Liu Zhijing felt even more ashamed inside. And it had all been because of Xia Xibei!Xia Xibei happened to look up and met Liu Zhijing\u2019s resentful gaze, flashing a bright smile at her.It caught Liu Zhijing off guard.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57: The Show Is StartingLiu Zhijing was startled by Xia Xibei\u2019s bright smile, finally returning it with a smug smile.Xia Xibei raised her eyebrows. When she moved her hand, there was a bird beside the window.Soon, from the mouth of the bird, she understood why Liu Zhijing smiled so proudly.Thinking of this, she gave Liu Zhijing a sarcastic and provocative smile, patting her own face lightly.Liu Zhijing\u2019s face instantly darkened, but before she could say anything, the teacher arrived, so she had to return to her own classroom unhappily.When Liu Zhijing sat in her seat and thought of Xia Xibei\u2019s provocation, her face became even gloomier.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Xia Qinghan asked in a low voice.\u201cNothing,\u201d she shook her head. \u201cI just thought of something.\u201d\u201cAs long as you\u2019re ok. If you need help, remember to tell me.\u201d\u201d\u201cOK.\u201dWatching Xia Qinghan, with her gentle smile and elegant demeanor, Liu Zhijing hated Xia Xibei even more. Xia Qinghan was the best star, while Xia Xibei was motherless and fatherless trash who was better off hiding in a corner.Outside, a few more birds appeared by the window, chirping very lively.Xia Xibei sat near the window. When she stretched out her hand and waved, the birds scattered.\u201cWhy are the birds so happy today?\u201d Tang Luo asked in confusion.There were normally a lot of birds here, but today they seemed to be extra excited, seemingly never stopping their chirping.\u201cMaybe something good happened!\u201d Xia Xibei crinkled her eyes. \u201cThe weather is nice, isn\u2019t it?\u201dTang Luo looked at her suspiciously, not understanding the connection between the two.However, he didn\u2019t have much time to think about it. The monthly exam was the next day and their focus should be on studying.Meanwhile, Xia Xibei looked at the blackboard with a faint smile on her lips.Just now, she saw Liu Zhijing walking towards the rooftop, closely followed by Yang Xuan, so she asked these birds to pay attention to their situation. Although the brains of these birds were small and they couldn\u2019t remember many things, Xia Xibei had quickly pieced together their plan from the birds\u2019 words.A hero saved a damsel in distress\u2026Hah, like they had the skills to be heroes!While Xia Xibei didn\u2019t think that they would give up on Song Jiaren so easily, she did not expect that they would use such stupid tricks.If they wanted to play a game, then she\u2019d make sure it was a good one! She\u2019d give them a chance to perform!With that plan in place, she focused all of her attention on studying. The monthly exam was the next day, and the top three students would receive scholarships.Before, Xia Xibei was far from the best, the scholarship not even on her mind. Now, however, the scholarship would be hers!Xia Xibei flipped through her books faster than she changed her facial expressions. Inspite of Tang Luo\u2019s focus, he noticed her motions.Was she reading books or flipping through them?!\u201cTomorrow is the monthly exam,\u201d Tang Luo couldn\u2019t resist saying.\u201cI know. I\u2019m reviewing right now,\u201d Xia Xibei replied, looking very serious.Tang Luo could only remain silent, full of confusion.Fine. She could do whatever she wanted.Soon, it was the afternoon. Xia Xibei had received a message from Song Jiaren saying that she had to deal with something first, so she would go to her house later.She already knew the address; she could go over by herself later on.Xia Xibei replied with a \u201creceived,\u201d showing a mischievous smile.Then she used the birds\u2019 guidance to go to the location where the hero would \u201csave the damsel.\u201dThe show would be starting soon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58: I Have to Protect YouIt was an alley behind the school, and unlike the hustle and bustle by the front entrance, very few pedestrians passed here.Usually there were some delinquents fighting in the area, so students rarely came to this area.This was where Song Jiaren usually chose to solve her problems, so she didn\u2019t feel nervous here at all.However, she didn\u2019t expect that after waiting here for a while, several men would appear in front of her.\u201cAre you Song Tianqin\u2019s daughter?\u201d The leader, a man with droopy eyes, looked at her with ill intentions in his eyes.\u201cWho are you?\u201d Seeing these tall men, Song Jiaren felt nervous. She continued asking vigilantly, \u201cWhat do you want?!\u201d She questioned them while carefully looking around, trying to look for an escape.\u201cNot much. I just wanted to talk to you,\u201d The man smiled grotesquely, and those next to him also smiling.Song Jiaren\u2019s heart felt heavier after seeing their smiles.If they dared to touch her after knowing who her father was, that meant this wasn\u2019t an easy fix.\u201cIf you do anything to me, my father will make you pay!\u201d she shouted at them. Although she had learned some fighting skills, she was still a girl, and it would not be easy to deal with these men.\u201cThen ask your dad to come get us!\u201d the man taunted, waving his hand, after which the people next to him immediately surrounded him.Song Jiaren decisively turned back and ran away.\u201cGet her!\u201dSong Jiaren\u2019s face paled when she heard footsteps coming behind her.Her large figure made her movements difficult, so they caught up to her in just a little while.\u201cStupid fatty, why don\u2019t you run?\u201d The leader grinned maliciously, adding, \u201cJust be good, we\u2019ll treat you well\u2026\u201d\u201cAaahhh!\u201dA voice sounded from behind them and a figure rushed out, waving a stick.\u201cJia Jia, run!\u201d Yang Xuan shouted as he waved the stick randomly.\u201cHell, where did this kid come from? Get him!\u201d the leader yelled, his face darkening.\u201cYes!\u201dThe others shouted as they rushed toward Yang Xuan.\u201cNo!\u201d Song Jiaren widened her eyes and looked at the scene in horror. She wanted to rush over but was stopped.\u201cI\u2019m warning you; I\u2019ve already called the police! They will be here in less than two minutes!\u201d Yang Xuan shouted, still waving the stick to block their movements.\u201cWhat\u2019s with this kid?! Trying to be a hero?! Beat him!\u201d the boss ordered.The others rushed up, taking away Yang Xuan\u2019s stick and punching him a few times.\u201cArgh!\u201dYang Xuan was beaten black and blue, screaming again and again, but he still desperately tried to make Song Jiaren leave.\u201cJia Jia, run!\u201dSong Jiaren\u2019s eyes could have burst from anger, but she didn\u2019t know what to do.While she was conflicted, the sound of police sirens rang, coming closer and closer.\u201cDamn! This kid really called the police!\u201d the leader yelled, \u201cYou\u2019re pretty fierce!\u201dShaking his head, he waved his hand, \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dThe other men acted decisively, quickly departing the scene.Seeing them leave, Song Jiaren\u2019s beating heart finally calmed down.Looking at Yang Xuan, who was on the ground, she immediately rushed over to help him. \u201cHow are you? Are you okay?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d Yang Xuan, who was bruised and swollen, said while looking worried. \u201cAre you okay? They didn\u2019t hit you, did they?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Song Jiaren shook her head. \u201cWhy are you acting so stupid?\u201d\u201cI asked to meet you here. I didn\u2019t think this would happen,\u201d Yang Xuan said while looking resigned, \u201cBut I had to protect you!\u201dThe words made Song Jiaren\u2019s heart beat fast again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59: Yang Xuan\u2019s ExplanationSong Jiaren was moved by Yang Xuan\u2019s words.Although it was Yang Xuan who suggested that they met up here in the first place, no one could have expected such an incident to befall her. It wasn\u2019t Yang Xuan\u2019s fault that those people had turned up. After all, they had sounded like they were here because of her father.Even if Yang Xuan wasn\u2019t around, they would still have found a chance to harm her.On the contrary, it was precisely because of Yang Xuan that those people left.Having thought that, the look in Song Jiaren\u2019s eyes turned tender as she looked at Yang Xuan.As he noticed the change in Song Jiaren, Yang Xuan got excited. The plan was working!\u201cAre you alright?\u201d he asked affectionately, \u201cThey didn\u2019t hurt you, did they?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Song Jiaren shook her head, helping him off of the ground.\u201cOuch\u2026\u201d Yang Xuan grimaced in pain but shook his head when Song Jiaren offered to get him help. \u201cI\u2019m fine, it\u2019s just some surface level injuries.\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not fine, let me take you to see a doctor!\u201d Song Jiaren looked at Yang Xuan worriedly, afraid he was hurt.\u201cI\u2019m really fine,\u201d Yang Xuan shook his head. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re willing to listen to me, I won\u2019t feel any pain.\u201dSong Jiaren paused for a second. \u201cWhat do you want to say?\u201d\u201cYou must have heard about yesterday\u2019s matter,\u201d Yang Xuan forced out with a wry smile.\u201cYes, I learned about it already.\u201dSpeaking about the matter, Song Jiaren\u2019s mood turned a little gloomy, her face twisting at the memory of finding out.\u201cBut those are only rumors!\u201d Yang Xuan insisted through gritted teeth, \u201cI never thought Xia Xibei would be so shameless!\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Song Jiaren asked, her face falling.Yang Xuan pretended not to notice Song Jiaren\u2019s displeasure, carrying on with his explanation. \u201cIn fact, I was on good terms with Xia Xibei previously.\u201d\u201cYou two were really a couple?\u201d Song Jiaren questioned, squinting in a menacing way.She had heard about Yang Xuan and Xia Xibei being a couple earlier on, which was why she went to look for Xia Xibei yesterday.However, she hadn\u2019t expected Xia Xibei to deny it so decisively. The series of events that occurred afterwards didn\u2019t match up with what she had heard either.\u201cOf course, we aren\u2019t!\u201d Yang Xuan shook his head immediately, \u201cAll we have is a little kinship.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Song Jiaren didn\u2019t expect Yang Xuan to spontaneously admit to that though.Liu Zhijing was related to Xia Xibei, and Yang Xuan were relatives with Liu Zhijing. To be precise, they shared some kinship indeed.\u201cAlthough it\u2019s a very distant connection, we are indeed relatives. However, she has never received any love and care from her parents. She\u2019s been lonely and isolated all this time, so I cared for her,\u201d Yang Xuan explained without inflection.\u201cWhat about the money, then?\u201d\u201cI get so mad just talking about it!\u201d Yang Xuan stated furiously. \u201cIn fact, she consigned the money to me for safekeeping!\u201d\u201cSafekeeping?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Yang Xuan asserted, seeming very indignant, \u201cShe said that she was saving up for college, but was afraid that she would spend the money, so she handed it to me for safekeeping. All she gave me was 10,000 dollars, but in the end, she claimed that I had borrowed 20,000!\u201dYang Xuan\u2019s chest hurt just by talking about the matter. That was 20,000 dollars!His parents were utterly shamed just because of those 20,000 dollars!\u201cSo that\u2019s what actually happened?\u201d Song Jiaren whispered, astounded by the explanation.\u201cI didn\u2019t know she scammed people for money in such a way until now! How obnoxious,\u201d Yang Xuan replied with gritted teeth.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you and Jin Yazhen, then?\u201d Song Jiaren questioned again.\u201cI\u2026 Jin Yazhen and Xia Xibei are good friends, that\u2019s why I had some interactions with her. But we don\u2019t get along often\u2026\u201d Yang Xuan\u2019s heart missed a beat, but he remained unruffled on the surface.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60: It Was Just For Show\u201cYou guys really don\u2019t get together often?\u201d Song Jiaren looked at him through squinted eyes, filled with both intimidation and suspicion.\u201cOf course, we don\u2019t!\u201d Yang Xuan shook his head resolutely, \u201cJin Yazhen and Xia Xibei are good friends, that\u2019s how we got into contact!\u201dHe was determined to hold onto that explanation and deny their relationship until the very end.Even if Song Jiaren went to find Jin Yazhen, Jin Yazhen wouldn\u2019t blow his cover. If she did admit, both of them would be finished!Looking at Yang Xuan\u2019s resolute attitude, Song Jiaren couldn\u2019t help but begin to doubt what had happened earlier.Seeing that she was moved, Yang Xuan immediately added, \u201cI think I saw you getting along well with Xia Xibei recently? You\u2019d better be careful not to be cheated by her!\u201d\u201cHow would she cheat me?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t understand why her parents didn\u2019t like her before, but now I know. Who would like a person who\u2019s full of lies!\u201d Yang Xuan said with a solemn look. \u201cDon\u2019t believe anything that she tells you, she\u2019s just too much!\u201d\u201cWhat would she tell me?\u201d\u201cWell, for one thing, me borrowing her money and that nonsense about me being in a relationship with someone else!\u201d Yang Xuan listed off, sounding righteous even to himself. \u201cShe\u2019s trying to get me in trouble!\u201d\u201cYou really aren\u2019t in a relationship with someone else?\u201d\u201cOf course, I\u2019m not!\u201d Yang Xuan shook his head continuously. \u201cHow could I even fall for someone else when I\u2019m with you?!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you think I\u2019m fat and ugly?\u201d\u201cYou are kind of fat,\u201d Yang Xuan nodded, hurriedly continuing before Song Jiaren could get mad, \u201cBut you aren\u2019t ugly at all! Plump girls like you are so adorable! I happen to be fond of that body shape!\u201dLooking at his serious, intent countenance, Song Jiaren felt a little warmth in her heart.Who wouldn\u2019t be happy if they were praised in that manner by someone of the opposite sex?\u201cYou really aren\u2019t lying to me?\u201d she asked once again, just to make sure.\u201cOf course not!\u201d Yang Xuan vowed, raising a hand, \u201cIf I lie to you, let me be knocked down by a car!\u201dA toy car, he added inwardly, just to be safe.However, his words had the intended effect, making Song Jiaren\u2019s face soften a lot.\u201cFine, I believe\u2026\u201dBefore she could finish, a series of hectic footsteps approached them from afar.Looking up in that direction, their faces fell.It was the same people as earlier, all of them wearing awful looks on their faces! The man in the lead dashed toward them with wide strides, giving Yang Xuan a brutal slap on his face.\u201cGod da*n it! How dare you fool us, you little brat!\u201dBoth Song Jiaren and Yang Xuan were stunned by the scene unfolding before their eyes.Why had they returned?!\u201cYou guys\u2026\u201dBefore Yang Xuan could finish, he got another harsh slap.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say it was just a show, and that no one would find out? I freaking believed your nonsense!\u201dThe chief seemed very battered, bruises present all over his face. It seemed that he had been badly beaten up, the guys behind him not faring any better.The chief\u2019s face was dark and gloomy, fighting the urge to murder Yang Xuan, especially when he thought of the people that they had just met.\u201cA show?!\u201d Song Jiaren exclaimed in jaw-dropping shock.\u201cMs. Song, we are really sorry! We didn\u2019t mean it! We were just acting! We had no intentions to harm you at all!\u201d the chief said apologetically.Then, pointing at Yang Xuan in rage, he revealed the truth.\u201cIt was all his intention! He wanted us to help him put on a show of heroism! He even assured us that there would be no problem at all, as no one was going to look into what we did! If not for that, we wouldn\u2019t have dared to treat you with the slightest bit of disrespect!\u201dThe chief\u2019s words made Song Jiaren freeze in utter horror.It had all just been a show arranged by Yang Xuan, with the help of these people?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61: Song Jiaren Turned SavageThe way the guys reacted put a look of dread on Yang Xuan\u2019s face, his heart beginning to thump wildly. \u201cYou- You guys\u2026\u201d\u201cMiss Song, we\u2019re so sorry! We shouldn\u2019t have done that! We beg you to help us ask for Boss Song\u2019s mercy! We really didn\u2019t hurt you!\u201dThe leader was on the brink of tears.When they took off leaving just now, they had thought that the matter had come to an end.Unexpectedly, their way was barred by a girl.Although she was quite pretty, the girl looked thin and feeble, so they didn\u2019t pay much attention to her.Little had they thought that several tall, heavily built men would appear after her!From the appearances and imposing manners of these men, it was clear that these guys had seen blood before, setting them apart from little rascals like themselves.Those men had taught them a brutal lesson, chasing them back here and forcing them to apologize to Song Jiaren.How dare they disobey? They returned immediately.Upon seeing Yang Xuan, all their pent-up anger and resentment became free at once.If it wasn\u2019t for Yang Xuan, who had assured them that nothing untoward would happen, they wouldn\u2019t have had the guts to do that!Song Tianqin was the big boss here!How could little sidekicks like them ever have the guts to go against Song Tianqin?Song Jiaren felt her heart sink upon hearing the guys\u2019 words. In a stiff manner, she turned to face Yang Xuan, who looked fearful and guilty. Slowly pronouncing each word, she asked, \u201cYou were lying to me?\u201dYang Xuan panicked and he shook his head hurriedly, \u201cNo, no, no! I really wasn\u2019t lying to you!\u201dHowever, before Song Jiaren could speak, the leader with slitted eyes gave him a violent punch.\u201cLittle scumbag, are you saying that I was the lying one then?!\u201d\u201cMiss Song, don\u2019t get angry. We have realized our mistakes, so please forgive us!\u201dThe sidekicks at the back also begged for her mercy, \u201cWe really have realized that what we did was wrong, we swear that we won\u2019t do it again!\u201dAs she watched how this absurd scene was unfolding, Song Jiaren felt her hands and feet go cold.Moments later, she questioned in a cold voice, \u201cWhat did he say to you?\u201d\u201cThis fellow gave us 3,000 yuan and asked us to stop you on your way. That way, he could play the hero and come save you!\u201d\u201cIt was that simple?\u201d\u201cYes! Otherwise, we wouldn\u2019t waste our time for just 3,000 yuan!\u201dThe entire process only took ten minutes, and they would be leaving with 3,000 yuan in their hands at the end of it.But who would have thought that things would eventually turn out this way?!\u201cThis is the money that he gave us! We don\u2019t want it anymore!\u201dThe narrow-eyed leader fished out the money from his pocket, snatching the rest of the money back from his sidekicks. He didn\u2019t dare count it, stuffing it directly into Song Jiaren\u2019s hand instead.\u201cWe don\u2019t want the money anymore! Miss Song, we really didn\u2019t do anything! Please let us go, I\u2019m begging you!\u201dSong Jiaren was rather baffled as she looked at the guys, weeping bitter tears of remorse.She wondered who had actually gotten involved, making them panic so terribly?However, she wasn\u2019t in the mood to bother with anything about them. \u201cFine, you may go. Just don\u2019t let me see you again from now on!\u201d\u201cOkay, okay! We\u2019ll go away now!\u201dThey were shedding tears of gratitude as they scrambled up from the ground, fleeing helter-skelter.\u201cJiajia\u2026\u201dYang Xuan forced out a smile, but his battered face made him look nothing but ridiculous, his usual charm nowhere to be seen.\u201cYou lied to me\u2026\u201dSong Jiaren spoke in a low, hoarse voice, an ice-cold look in her eyes.Yang Xuan\u2019s heart was pounding insanely in his chest. Song Jiaren looked like she was turning into a savage.\u201cHow dare you freaking lie to me!\u201d Song Jiaren growled in fury. She stepped forward in wide strides and landed a brutal punch on Yang Xuan\u2019s eye!\u201cAhh!\u201d Yang Xuan screamed in agony, the skin around his eye turning black instantly.\u201cPlaying the hero and saving me?! This serves you right!\u201dSong Jiaren\u2019s rage did not dwindle at all. Rather, it escalated even more. Punch after punch, she unleashed her rage on Yang Xuan\u2019s face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62: Seeing the Scumbag ClearlySong Jiaren had always had a hot temper. Otherwise she wouldn\u2019t have had a reputation at school.She hated people lying to her!Earlier, while she had known that Yang Xuan was two-timing her, she didn\u2019t want to do anything about it after her anger had worn off. After all, he had treated her quite well.But Yang Xuan had lied to her again!Saving a damsel in distress?!Song Jiaren was so upset that her chest hurt, and she kept shaking her fists at him.\u201cNo, no! Please don\u2019t!\u201dYang Xuan was so scared, desperately trying to hide.Song Jiaren\u2019s fists were so scary! If he didn\u2019t escape, she would probably kill him!Song Jiaren couldn\u2019t control her emotions, her eyes were red.She kept hitting, wanting to kill this scumbag!\u201cAlright!\u201d a clear, sweet voice sounded.Then, Song Jiaren\u2019s fist was clenched by someone else.She turned her head mechanically and met Xia Xibei\u2019s gentle eyes.\u201cNo more. Don\u2019t kill him.\u201dXia Xibe had stopped her movement, explaining, \u201cDon\u2019t dirty our hands.\u201dSong Jiaren was still numb. She hadn\u2019t fully recovered, let alone noticed Xia Xibei\u2019s strength.Yang Xuan looked at Xia Xibei, who had suddenly appeared, in shock. He couldn\u2019t help but widen his eyes when thinking about the people who had just left.\u201cIt was you?!\u201dIf it was earlier, he would not have suspected Xia Xibei. But after being beaten by her twice, how could he not know who she was?With her strength, it was possible for her to drive those people back.Yang Xuan gritted his teeth with hatred. He didn\u2019t expect his plan to be messed up by Xia Xibei!\u201cBeibei.\u201dSong Jiaren finally came to her senses, her tense body relaxing.Feeling wronged and sad, she hugged Xia Xibei.How could she not be sad? Yang Xuan was the first person she had liked! But he had done this to her! He was despicable!\u201cIt\u2019s okay, let\u2019s not be sad anymore.\u201dXia Xibei patted Song Jiaren on the back, comforting her, \u201cNow that we\u2019ve seen the true face of this scumbag, we won\u2019t be fooled anymore.\u201d\u201cIt was you!\u201d Yang Xuan accused, pointing at Xia Xibei angrily, \u201cYou found those people! You were the one who caused all this trouble!\u201dSong Jiaren became angry once again, demanding, \u201cWhy are you still lying?!\u201dHow dare he put the blame on Xia Xibei now?! He was so shameless!Yang Xuan wanted self-respect, but he wanted money even more! He could not let Song Jiaren leave him. Otherwise, what was the point of him doing all that work before?\u201cI didn\u2019t lie! She must have found those people to frame me! Jiajia, don\u2019t be fooled by her!\u201d\u201cOh? I found those people, did I?\u201d Xia Xibei raised her eyebrows. \u201cSo, you didn\u2019t find those people, you didn\u2019t give them the money, and you didn\u2019t cheat either?\u201d\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t!\u201d Yang Xuan denied with a stiff neck. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me!\u201dThen he looked at Song Jiaren with a wounded face, \u201cJiajia, don\u2019t be fooled by this b*tch!\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Xia Xibei suddenly showed a sarcastic smile. She reached out her hand, snatching his phone out of his pocket.\u201cWhat are you doing?! Give it back!\u201dYang Xuan was panicking, wanting to take the phone back, but Xia Xibei had grabbed his hand and twisted it behind his back.\u201cOw, ow, ow! what are you doing?!\u201d Yang Xuan yelled, unable to stop Xia Xibei.Quickly, Xia Xibei unlocked the phone with his fingerprint.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63: Solid ProofAfter unlocking Yang Xuan\u2019s phone, Xia Xibei went into his Penguin account and opened his gallery.\u201cGive the phone back to me!\u201dYang Xuan was scared out of his wits, his face having turned pale.\u201cGive it back to me!\u201dHe was ready to fight, reaching out to snatch his phone back, but Xia Xibei raised a leg and kicked him to the side.Before Song Jiaren had a chance to marvel at Xia Xibei\u2019s prowess, she saw the photo displayed on the phone\u2019s screen.In the photo, Yang Xuan and Jin Yazhen\u2019s heads were positioned right next to each other\u2019s, looking very intimate, and they were both wearing bright, blissful smiles.Song Jiaren\u2019s breath caught in her throat upon seeing such forthright evidence.With a simple swipe of Xia Xibei\u2019s fingers, the next photo appeared.It was still Yang Xuan and Jin Yazhen. This time, their lips were touching.The look on Song Jiaren\u2019s face turned even more awful.The next photo also showed Yang Xuan, but it was a different woman this time.Song Jiaren snatched the phone and browsed through all the photos on her own.The more she saw, the more appalled she appeared to be.It was exactly as Xia Xibei had said. Yang Xuan was a downright womanizer!These were photos of Yang Xuan with several girls, and Jin Yazhen was only one of them!Yang Xuan finally scrambled up from the ground. Sweating profusely, looking overwrought and anxious, he demanded, \u201cGive me my phone back!\u201dSong Jiaren turned the phone straight to him, and his heart went cold when he saw the photo on the screen.\u201cExplain to me. Who are these girls?\u201dYang Xuan felt chills cascading down his spine. He never thought that these photos would be discovered!He remembered setting a privacy restriction on these photos, so how did Xia Xibei find out?!\u201cYou said that Beibei was falsely accusing you. So did Beibei take these photos, then?\u201d Song Jiaren asked through gritted teeth, her expression vile and ferocious.\u201cPlease\u2026 Please listen, I can explain this\u2026\u201d Yang Xuan stuttered, panicking.This time, however, Song Jiaren didn\u2019t bother to listen to his explanation anymore. Instead, she grabbed the phone and smashed it violently into his face.\u201cAhh!\u201dThe pain of being hit in the face by the phone was too excruciating. Yang Xuan felt like his nose was falling right off his face.The phone fell onto the ground, but he didn\u2019t bother picking it up. He was filled to the brim with panic and dread, just wanting Song Jiaren to turn around.Song Jiaren turned around indeed, but she swept him to the side with a hard slap on his face.\u201cYang Xuan, how dare you fool me?!\u201dSong Jiaren pointed at him in fury, the look in her eyes perilous.She was a little embarrassed that Yang Xuan had nearly convinced her. She had even doubted Xia Xibei, wondering if she was lying to her!But eventually, it turned out that Yang Xuan was the jerk that had been lying to her!And he didn\u2019t lie to her because he liked her! He only did that because of her father!Having thought that, she got so angry that she laughed. \u201cYang Xuan, since you know what kind of man my father is, you should know what the consequences of lying to me are! You\u2019re never gonna get away!\u201dOnce she was finished, she snorted and turned around to leave.Yang Xuan was anxious and terrified. He would be doomed now that he had offended the Song family!However, he didn\u2019t have the courage to go pursue her, because Song Jiaren\u2019s fury wasn\u2019t something that he would be able to withstand.Xia Xibei\u2019s lips twitched. She took Song Jiaren\u2019s hand and left.After taking a turn, they reached the side of the road.\u201cAlright, don\u2019t overthink. We have to go back and carry on with our weight loss plans! Once you slim down, there won\u2019t be any guys out of your reach!\u201dXia Xibei didn\u2019t bother to comfort her, changing the subject directly.Song Jiaren couldn\u2019t help but laugh through her anger when she heard what Xia Xibei said.However, before she could respond to that, a hunky figure appeared before them.\u201cIs it over now? Let\u2019s go.\u201dSong Jiaren raised her gaze to look and became dumbfounded instantly.\u2014\u2014What a handsome man!\u201cThis is Mr. Qiao,\u201d Xia Xibei introduced him to her.\u201cMr. Qiao?\u201d Song Jiaren gasped, the look in her eyes changing. \u201cThat impotent Mr. Qiao?!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Laughing dryly, she told Song Jiaren, \u201cHaha\u2026 You\u2019re mistaken, it\u2019s not him\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s the other Mr. Qiao!\u201d Song Jiaren came to a sudden realization. \u201cThis Mr. Qiao and the Mr. Qiao who delivered food to us aren\u2019t the same person!\u201dXia Xibei\u2019s lips twitched, not daring to sneak a glance at Qiao Yanjue.Qiao Yanjue\u2019s face had completely darkened, because he was the same Mr. Qiao who had delivered food to them yesterday!Little had he thought that Xia Xibei would speak of him in that way!Xia Xibei felt chills cascading down her spine, sensing that Qiao Yanjue\u2019s eyes were filled with a murderous look right now.She changed the subject immediately, \u201cAlright, let\u2019s get back as soon as we can. It\u2019s late already. Oh, right, where\u2019s your driver?\u201dSong Jiaren fumbled to get out her phone. \u201cI\u2019ll ask him to come over now.\u201d\u201cNo need for that, I\u2019ll send the two of you back,\u201d Qiao Yanjue spoke up.The reason he came here today was to bring Xia Xibei to the pharmacy.\u201cNo need, we have a car!\u201dHow could Xia Xibei have the nerve to stay in the same space as Qiao Yanjue? After what Song Jiaren said just now, it was way too embarrassing.\u201cMiss, I happen to be going the same way. We should go together.\u201dOut of nowhere, Qiao Yanjue flashed a smile at Song Jiaren.Song Jiaren\u2019s eyes went wide immediately. He was so charming!He was tall and handsome and graceful and elegant, so much more attractive than the male celebrities out there!At that moment, Song Jiaren forgot that Yang Xuan even existed.\u2014\u2014The two of them just weren\u2019t on the same level, able to be compared!\u201cSure, sure, sure! Let\u2019s go together!\u201d Song Jiaren\u2019s eyes were shimmering.It wasn\u2019t that she had any feelings for Qiao Yanjue. Just being able to travel in the same car with such a handsome man was a blessing!As she watched how Song Jiaren had succumbed without any hesitation, Xia Xibei\u2019s lips twitched in frustration. How she wished she could give her a slap!Although Qiao Yanjue was very handsome indeed, he was venomous!With Song Jiaren\u2019s brains, she might even help him count his profit if he ever sold her to someone else!Song Jiaren had no idea what Xia Xibei was thinking, looking at her expectantly. \u201cSince you know each other, we should go together!\u201dXia Xibei pulled her to the side, and asked through gritted teeth, \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid that he might be a bad guy?\u201dSong Jiaren blinked, looking bewildered. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t look like a bad guy though!\u201dShe had followed her father around and seen quite a lot of people.Sure, she wasn\u2019t a hundred percent accurate in telling the good guys apart from the bad guys, but there was no way a man as outstanding as Qiao Yanjue could be bad!Even though he might not be a good guy, he certainly wouldn\u2019t hurt the two of them.\u201cHow are you so confident in your judgment?\u201d Xia Xibei was exasperated that Song Jiaren was so easily influenced.If Song Jiaren really was good at discerning between good and bad, she wouldn\u2019t have been cheated by Yang Xuan!She might have spoken her thoughts if not for the fact that she didn\u2019t want to unravel Song Jiaren\u2019s wound.However, Song Jiaren\u2019s self-healing ability was unexpectedly great. \u201cYang Xuan was an exception! He\u2019s different from Mr. Qiao!\u201dSong Jiaren could tell that the car behind Qiao Yanjue had cost at least a few million!How could someone like that do bad things to her?\u201cOkay then. Putting all that aside, you know him, don\u2019t you? If he\u2019s a bad guy, why would you bring me here?\u201dSpeaking more precisely, what she really believed in was Xia Xibei\u2019s judgment.Xia Xibei was rendered speechless by her question.Although Qiao Yanjue wasn\u2019t really a good guy, he didn\u2019t count as a bad guy either.\u201cCan we leave now?\u201d Qiao Yanjue finally spoke, an enchanting smile on his lips.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65: Different Forms of AddressSong Jiaren got into the car quickly, her cheeks a rosy shade of red.Qiao Yanjue\u2019s smile was so mesmerizing that she found it hard to resist.However, what kind of relation did Xia Xibei have with such a handsome man?Xia Xibei was at a loss for words as she watched Song Jiaren getting into the car with swift, nimble movements.She must be wishing very badly for Qiao Yanjue to sell her to someone else!Upon meeting Song Jiaren\u2019s trustful gaze, she had no choice but to grit her teeth and get inside the car.Luckily, Qiao Yanjue didn\u2019t go for the passenger seat, but the co-driver seat instead. Xia Xibei heaved a sigh of relief when seeing that.The car moved forward and Song Jiaren muttered softly to Xia Xibei, \u201cHow did the two of you get to know each other?\u201d\u201cBy chance,\u201d Xia Xibei replied, her expression remaining unruffled.\u201cHe\u2019s so good-looking!\u201d Song Jiaren clasped her mouth and giggled as she spoke.Xia Xibei was speechless. She didn\u2019t know until now that Song Jiaren was such a groupie!However, she was rather glad that Song Jiaren had managed to detach herself from Yang Xuan\u2019s affairs.Although she hadn\u2019t known Song Jiaren for more than two days, she found Song Jiaren to be a good person.Despite being plump, she had a generous and loyal personality, which suited her very well. Moreover, she was very different from the arrogant, domineering bully that the other students assumed her to be.Qiao Yanjue kept a composed look, as though he had no idea what the two girls were chatting about in the back.\u201cDo we go to the herb store first or your place?\u201d he asked.Xia Xibei thought for a second before answering, \u201cThe herb store.\u201dShe didn\u2019t want Qiao Yanjue to go to her place. Besides, she had agreed upon treating him at the herb store previously.Qiao Yanjue nodded and the driver expressed his understanding immediately.Although she was confused, Song Jiaren remained quiet.Very soon, the car arrived at Huo Zijun\u2019s herb store.Once they got out of the car, Song Jiaren\u2019s eyes became wide.\u201cThis herb store is so huge!\u201dThe scent of herbs could be picked up on when approaching the place, so one could only imagine just how much herbs there were in the store.When Huo Zijun came out, Song Jiaren\u2019s eyes became even wider.\u201cSo handsome!\u201d\u201cBrother Huo, this is my schoolmate, Song Jiaren. Jiaren, you could call him brother Huo, just like I do. He\u2019s friends with Mr. Qiao,\u201d Xia Xibei introduced him to her.\u201cHello, brother Huo!\u201d Song Jiaren\u2019s eyes lit up instantly, but she was baffled when she recalled Xia Xibei\u2019s last line. \u201cWait, why do you address them differently?\u201dOne was brother Huo, while the other was Mr. Qiao. It was obvious whom Xia Xibei was closer with!The look on Qiao Yanjue\u2019s face turned dismal as well.He still couldn\u2019t wrap his head around the reason why Xia Xibei was so cold and distant toward him.Even Song Jiaren, who had met him for the first time today, had noticed the problem.\u201cMr. Qiao is an elder, of course. We have to show him respect,\u201d Xia Xibei said with a straight face.Qiao Yanjue\u2019s face turned as dark as coal.He remembered how Xia Xibei had previously called him \u201cuncle.\u201dHe gnashed his teeth and flashed a humorless smile, pointing out, \u201cI\u2019m the same age as Zijun!\u201dThey were the same age and they weren\u2019t even relatives, so what was the difference in their forms of address all about?!He then looked toward Song Jiaren. \u201cI\u2019ll call you Jiaren, and you may call me brother Qiao.\u201dSong Jiaren was startled for a moment before she nodded, \u201cBrother Qiao!\u201dQiao Yanjue nodded with a smile, then looked towards Xia Xibei, waiting for her to address him in the same way.Xia Xibei\u2019s lips twitched with unease. This man was just too cunning!She was schoolmates with Song Jiaren, so wouldn\u2019t she have to call him brother too, if that was what Song Jiaren did? Otherwise, the seniority would be all messed up.He was a crafty man indeed!\u201cBrother Qiao,\u201d Xia Xibei finally said with a joyless smile, left with no other choice.The soreness within Qiao Yanjue was finally relieved.Huo Zijun, who was standing at the side, couldn\u2019t help but shake his head as he watched the scene in front of him.Qiao Yanjue was a whole different person in front of Xia Xibei!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66: Million Dollar Wisdom and CourageSince she had promised Qiao Yanjue that she would treat him, Xia Xibei certainly wouldn\u2019t be lackadaisical about her work.She worked rather fast, in fact. After taking his pulse, she grabbed a pen and scribbled the prescription, her handwriting lively and unbridled, looking very regal.\u201cThese are to be taken orally, and these are to be applied topically. Follow this for two days, three times a day after meals. I\u2019ll be coming over again three days from now.\u201dIn just half an hour, Xia Xibei was ready to leave with Song Jiaren.\u201cDon\u2019t you want to stay for dinner?\u201d Huo Zijun asked, trying to persuade her to stay.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. We\u2019ll go back and have our dinner,\u201d Xia Xibei turned down the invitation with a shake of her head.Qiao Yanjue watched from the side but remained silent.Song Jiaren was rather reluctant to leave.Both men were extremely attractive and very pleasant to admire!\u201cDon\u2019t you want to become a beauty?\u201dXia Xibei\u2019s words made her change her mind right away.She was right! All attractive men belonged to others, so she should definitely put herself first!Hence, she obediently followed behind Xia Xibei, leaving the store.As he watched the two girls leave, Huo Zijun raised his brows at Qiao Yanjue.\u201cWhat now, you like the little girl?\u201dQiao Yanjue rolled his eyes and handed the prescription for him to inspect. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201dHuo Zijun looked over the prescription. After some careful contemplation, a solemn look came over his face.\u201cIt fits the condition, and it\u2019s even better than mine.\u201dSome of the herbs were rather heavy in proportion, which he found inappropriate at first.When all the herbs were used in conjunction, however, the effects were balanced out.\u201cWhere on earth did she acquire this expertise?\u201d Huo Zijun wondered, extremely curious.She was clearly just a young girl, but she was even more proficient than him when it came to traditional medicine.He came from a family background filled with traditional medicine and had started learning about herbs before he had even learnt to read. But how did Xia Xibei do it?\u201cThat\u2019s her business. Why do you want to know?\u201d Qiao Yanjue questioned, shooting him a glance. \u201cGo and cook the herbs.\u201dAlthough he wanted to stick around, he wouldn\u2019t meddle with his own health.Huo Zijun rolled his eyes in annoyance. This guy was really great at burning bridges after crossing them! He was just unlucky to have fallen into his trap.Meanwhile, Xia Xibei and Song Jiaren had returned home.Upon their return, they heard a knock on the door again, which turned out to be the same two boys who had delivered food to them the day before.Xia Xibei\u2019s expression stiffened for a second when she saw them, but she still let them inside.It was still the same portions, but the dishes had changed.After the two boys left, Song Jiaren asked in awe and surprise, \u201cAre all the people with the surname Qiao so kind-hearted nowadays?\u201dXia Xibei\u2019s lips twitched, but she did not carry on with the subject.\u201cAlright, we\u2019ll begin after dinner.\u201dSince it was delivered to them already, they shouldn\u2019t waste it.After the meal and the herbal bath, the driver came to fetch Song Jiaren back home.After seeing Song Jiaren off, Xia Xibei tidied up her house and fumbled to get her phone out.After opening Weibo, she saw the little red dot that indicated that she had notifications.She opened it and saw that it was a private message sent by an official account titled \u201cMillion Dollar Wisdom and Courage.\u201dThere was a link attached to the message. Once opened, one could start answering the questions.It left Xia Xibei baffled for a moment.\u201cMillion Dollar Wisdom and Courage\u201d was an intellectual-type variety show in which candidates had to beat levels.The questions in it encompassed everything from the skies to the oceans, from astronomy to geography. There was nothing the programme crew couldn\u2019t come up with, including things that you had never heard of.Most importantly, the final reward was ten million yuan! Even after deducting taxes, the remaining sum was astonishing.Of course, one had to win various challenges and beat numerous levels to earn the ten million yuan.During the earlier stages of the programme, candidates were selected from the Internet. When it progressed to the final stages, the show would be aired live.Back then, this show was very popular!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67: The Intelligent Goddess\u201cMillion Dollar Wisdom and Courage\u201d was a very popular programme back then, creating a trend of answering questions among the general public.Furthermore, Xia Qinghan\u2019s top-student character had begun with this programme.In the eyes of her fans, Xia Qinghan was a downright goddess, known for her good looks, intelligence, and many talents!A character like that had contributed tremendously to her popularity.However, Xia Xibei knew that Xia Qinghan\u2019s top-student character was a fabrication, made up of empty claims, which cost them quite a great deal of money and effort.But she was back now, so there was no way she would allow Xia Qinghan to keep behaving so smugly.This was a great point to begin with.As the thought occurred to her, Xia Xibei opened the link. She quickly created an account and began answering the questions.The programme had several episodes, and the first two were very simple. Anyone with common sense who had knowledge in a fair variety of fields and worked on it carefully would pass.Moreover, contestants could cheat during the first two episodes. After all, no one would know how many people were sitting in front of the phone or the laptop, or how many brains were working on the questions.Hence, many contestants chose to get help from their family members or friends when completing the quiz.However, changes would be introduced if they proceeded to the quarterfinals.Contestants would be required to turn on their webcams while answering the questions, so that their actual identities could be verified.If they passed the level this time, they could join the programme crew and take part in the filming of the show.There were tens of thousands of contestants who had participated during the first stages, but by the time the programme was recorded live, only a few hundred contestants would be left.After two rounds of contests, only ten contestants would make it to the finals.Competition among them was extremely intense.Besides, the questions in the beginning were multiple-choice questions with four choices, so the probability of selecting the right answer was very high. Lucky contestants could even overcome all the odds and beat the levels smoothly.However, when it came to the finals, there would be questions where contestants had to fill in their answers.Previously, Xia Qinghan was among the ten contestants that made it to the finals, but she got eliminated at the beginning.Even so, she had managed to attract some attention because she was fortunate enough to be the most good-looking of the ten contestants.When she officially debuted, her crew scavenged those clips and began circulating press reports, helping her establish the character of an intelligent goddess.As she thought about that, the smile on Xia Xibei\u2019s lips grew wide, while her fingers continued working away on the screen.It only took her a glance to read the question and choices on the screen clearly. Then, she pressed one of the choices without even having to think it through.A big red tick popped up, and she quickly progressed to the next question.Right as the question was displayed, Xia Xibei clicked on one of the choices without batting an eyelid.Another red tick appeared.The next question.Then the next.\u2026Then the next.Some of the rather ambiguous questions seemed as straightforward as 1+1 as far as Xia Xibei was concerned.Very soon, an adorable cartoon character popped up.\u201cCongratulations, you have answered all the questions correctly! Please wait for further notice!\u201dXia Xibei took a look at the time and yawned. She turned off her phone and got ready to sleep.Little did she know that her results had garnered quite a great deal of attention upon being received by the behind-the-scenes crew.\u201cLittle Seashell of Hope? This contestant\u2019s results are awesome!\u201dThe workers couldn\u2019t help but marvel at the results they saw.\u201cWhat results?\u201d One of them got near and raised his brows upon seeing the score. \u201cFull marks? Not bad, indeed.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s more than just not bad!\u201d The first worker was deep in awe. \u201cLook at the time spent!\u201d\u201cGod d*mn it! Ten minutes?

Each question was one point, leading to a total possible score of one hundred points.Any contestants who achieved 85 points and above would proceed to the next round.There were contestants who had achieved full marks in the past, but not within such a short duration!The time limit for each question was twenty seconds, which meant it would take approximately half an hour to complete the entire round.Those who worked fast could complete all the questions in around twenty minutes.However, this was the first time the crew had seen a full score attained at such a speed!\u201cAmazing, getting a full score in just ten minutes\u2026 This speed is lit! Six seconds per question! Did he even finish reading the questions?\u201d\u201cEven the question creators need to spend some time, don\u2019t they?\u201d\u201cCould he have had access to our question bank?\u201dAlthough it was mentioned, all of them knew that it was impossible.Their question bank contained several tens of thousands of questions. It wasn\u2019t so easy to achieve such a score, even if the contestant really did take the shortcut.\u201cLet\u2019s take a look at the questions! Perhaps it\u2019s just some very simple questions!\u201dThey could view what questions were answered by the contestants behind the scenes, but they had no right to interfere with it.Upon opening the questions, all of them were stupefied.\u201cD*mn! These questions are tough!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t even know the answer to this question!\u201dThe questions in their question bank were categorized by their respective levels of difficulty, the highest level being five-star and the lowest being one-star.Among the questions answered by this contestant however, more than thirty were three-star and above, and more than ten of them were four and five-star questions!They might not get the questions correct, even if they were to answer them.\u201cThis will definitely be a strong competitor afterwards!\u201dOne of the workers marked the results of this particular account red, only continuing to browse others\u2019 results after another round of discussion.Xia Xibei knew nothing about all of this. She went straight to bed after taking a shower once she had finished answering the questions.Early the next morning, she woke up for a jog and found a spot along the way for cultivation.Her martial strength wasn\u2019t very high. After all, her occupation in the second life was a doctor and a naturalist, so there was no need for her to spend too much time on cultivating martial strength.Although her occupation was a vulnerable one in the Land of Fantasy, her martial strength was enough to defeat many people in this place.Not to mention the fact that she had other capabilities!One hour later, she went to school after having taken a shower.The monthly assessment would be taking place today.After completing two assessments, it would be the weekend.Upon going to school, Xia Xibei happened to run into Liu Zhijing.Xia Xibei paused in her tracks when she met Liu Zhijing\u2019s hateful, vicious gaze, flashing her an evil smile.Liu Zhijing\u2019s heart skipped a beat. What did that mean?When Yang Xuan came back yesterday with a swollen face and hideous bruises covering him, she was flabbergasted!Once she learnt about what actually happened, she found out that the godd*mned Xia Xibei had intervened once again!What was the matter with Xia Xibei? When had she acquired such capabilities?However, Liu Zhijing was more worried about Song Jiaren.Who didn\u2019t know that Song Jiaren was the boss of the school? The consequences of offending her would be disastrous!She felt angst lurking within her. When Liu Zhijing went back to the classroom, she still seemed a little unnerved.\u201cWhat happened? Are you alright?\u201d Xia Qinghan asked, expressing her concern.\u201cNo, nothing,\u201d Liu Zhijing hurriedly shook her head in denial and forced a smile onto her face. \u201cI\u2019m just a little nervous.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll definitely get good grades!\u201d Xia Qinghan comforted her with a warm smile.\u201cYeah, you too!\u201d Xia Qinghan nodded with a smile, but it disappeared very soon.Much to her surprise, Xia Xibei turned out to be in the same examination room that she was in!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69: The Same Exam RoomThe moment she saw Xia Xibei, Xia Qinghan\u2019s face fell.The jealousy in her burned even more fiercely when she saw Xia Xibei\u2019s gorgeous face.She had always been very confident in her own beauty since she was a child.However, Xia Xibei\u2019s appearance made her realize that she never was the greatest.She felt even more despondent when she heard what the other students were talking about.\u201cHi there! You\u2019re assigned to this classroom too?\u201d Xia Qinghan quickly pulled herself together and flashed a bright smile at Xia Xibei.\u201cYes.\u201dXia Xibei\u2019s lips curled into a small, polite smile, then she turned around and sat down in the seat that was allocated to her.Xia Xibei\u2019s cold, detached response made Xia Qinghan pull a long face.The rest of the students were paying attention to them, so she couldn\u2019t do much except wear an awkward smile.However, her mood was soon affected.Because she found that her seat was right next to Xia Xibei\u2019s, with just an aisle in between them!Xia Xibei was equally speechless. She never thought that she would have such a strong \u201caffinity\u201d with Xia Qinghan.Things like this hadn\u2019t happened before in the past, had they?\u201cI\u2026\u201dXia Qinghan forced a smile onto her face and tried to start a conversation. However, Xia Xibei didn\u2019t even glance at her this time, her gaze fixed on a book instead.Xia Qinghan was so mad at Xia Xibei\u2019s reaction that her chest ached.But she couldn\u2019t let it show, because she had a reputation to uphold: that of being the school beauty!Once everyone had taken their seats, the teacher arrived.When she received the test paper, Xia Xibei flashed a placid smile at Xia Qinghan before beginning to answer the questions.Xia Qinghan was disconcerted by that smile, which she found rather unusual.She was vexed and confused. There wasn\u2019t any love or hate between her and Xia Xibei, so why was she treating her like this?Was she worried that she might hinder her from becoming famous?Ha! She was very conceited, wasn\u2019t she?Xia Qinghan mumbled inside her head, the look in her eyes mildly sarcastic when she looked towards Xia Xibei.It was true that Xia Xibei had fairly good looks, but it wasn\u2019t very easy to become a celebrity.Without any talents or gifts, that pretty face alone wouldn\u2019t get her very far.No matter how lenient the fans were, they wouldn\u2019t persevere for long once they found out that their idol was an airhead.Not to mention the fact there were many beauties in the entertainment industry. What would Xia Xibei even amount to?Besides, with Xia Xibei\u2019s background, how could she possibly have any talents?She had even heard that Xia Xibei had needed to take up part-time jobs to support herself. She couldn\u2019t even maintain average results as a result.A person like Xia Xibei was trying to rival her? That was absolutely ridiculous!\u201cFocus on your paper! Do not look around!\u201dThe teacher knocked on a table from the podium, pulling Xia Qinghan back to reality.She hurriedly pulled her thoughts together and shifted her focus to the paper in front of her.Xia Xibei had no idea about the thoughts going through Xia Qinghan\u2019s head, fully focused on the paper.As far as she was concerned, the questions weren\u2019t that difficult for her. They were the same questions from the textbooks, just phrased differently.As for reading and comprehension, it was also a piece of cake once you mastered the correct techniques.For essays, she was able to compose smoothly based on her many years of experience and views on life.Xia Xibei completed the language paper in less than two hours.Xia Qinghan was startled when she saw Xia Xibei submitting the paper ahead of time, then sneered with sarcasm.She handed in the paper earlier because she couldn\u2019t do it! That must be the case, right?It wasn\u2019t just the language paper. Xia Xibei had also submitted the papers for the next few subjects earlier than scheduled.It made everyone wonder whether she was really able to do them. Was she submitting them now because she was so bad at it that she had got nothing left to lose?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70: Make MoneyOf course, Xia Xibei wasn\u2019t admitting defeat.With her powerful memory, she had managed to finish reading all the required books during the past few days after her return.Her memory was so powerful that it took her just one glance to remember what she had read. Better still, she was able to read ten lines at once.Besides, she had always been fast when answering questions. She did questions that she knew and questions that she didn\u2019t know both at the same speed.For the ones that she knew, she would come up with the answers rapidly.For the ones she didn\u2019t, she would skip them directly, wasting no time.Furthermore, she was an arts student, so the majority of knowledge relied upon memorization.In the past, she used to painstakingly practice speaking English for a period of time, hoping to get a role in a movie from Country M. Thus, she was able to speak with the same accent as that of people from Country M, and her vocabulary was very wide.Although she didn\u2019t succeed in the end, her English had always been quite impressive.Besides, she was pretty talented in mathematics too.In fact, Xia Xibei had chosen arts back then mainly because of Jin Yazhen. She was so terrible at science, she could only opt for the arts.As a good friend, Xia Xibei had no choice but to choose arts as well, just to keep Jin Yazhen company.Upon stepping out of the exam room, Xia Xibei did a rough estimation. Her results for the monthly assessment should be satisfactory, and it wouldn\u2019t be a problem for her to be ranked among the top.After the exams, Xia Xibei made another trip to the herb store.The herbs that Huo Zijun had provided were of great quality, so Qiao Yanjue\u2019s injury had healed rapidly.\u201cI\u2019ve changed some of the herbs for you. Like before, take these orally and apply these topically\u2026\u201dXia Xibei finished what she had to say with an expressionless face. Right as she finished, she grabbed her bag and got ready to leave without the slightest hesitation.Huo Zijun spoke hurriedly as he saw the expression on Qiao Yanjue\u2019s face turning dismal.\u201cYou\u2019re on holiday now, aren\u2019t you? You wouldn\u2019t be in a hurry to leave, then. How about staying for dinner?\u201d\u201cNo need for that,\u201d Xia Xibei shook her head. \u201cI have to go back to help my friend lose weight.\u201dAt that point, she turned and shot a look at Qiao Yanjue. \u201cOh, right, you don\u2019t have to send me food anymore. I can cook on my own.\u201dShe didn\u2019t want to hear Song Jiaren mentioning the impotent Mr. Qiao all the time. It was way too awkward!Qiao Yanjue\u2019s expression finally seemed a bit better. \u201cI\u2019m just paying you back, it\u2019s not a big deal to me.\u201dBefore Xia Xibei could speak, he went on, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Once I go back, I won\u2019t be sending you food anymore.\u201dSince Qiao Yanjue had put it that way, Xia Xibei had no choice but to go along with it.He would be gone in just a couple of days anyway. It would be nice to have a few more free meals.Besides, her treatment for Qiao Yanjue had yielded superb effects, so she didn\u2019t feel guilty accepting his money.Xia Xibei had over 400,000 yuan in hand at the moment, but that money couldn\u2019t be mobilized for now, and she couldn\u2019t possibly spend a thousand on a single meal.400,000 yuan might seem like a great sum, but once it was put to use, it wouldn\u2019t appear to be a lot anymore.Moreover, she had to keep strengthening herself, so money was of paramount importance at the moment.Therefore, she had to come up with new ways to make money.But how could she generate more money with the money that she had?Looking at the milk tea that a customer in the herb store was holding, an idea popped into Xia Xibei\u2019s head.\u2014\u2014As long as people lived, food would be their greatest necessity!As the thought occurred to her, she instantly became invigorated, her little mind working at a very fast speed.\u201cBrother Huo, I\u2019d like to buy some herbs from you.\u201dUpon meeting Xia Xibei\u2019s glittering eyes, Huo Zijun was a little taken back.\u201cWhich ones do you want?\u201dXia Xibei fumbled to take out her notebook right away, scribbling the names of a bunch of herbs.\u201cJust these ones!\u201dHuo Zijun took the notebook and skimmed through it. They were common enough herbs but were required in great quantities.\u201cWe have all of them here.\u201dHe handed the notebook to the shopkeeper.Very soon, several bags of herbs emerged and were placed in front of Xia Xibei.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71: Milk Tea that Wouldn\u2019t Make You FatUpon arriving at Xia Xibei\u2019s house, Song Jiaren found out that herbs weren\u2019t the only new thing at her house. There was also powdered milk, tea leaves, and a bunch of strange but familiar-looking utensils and appliances.\u201cWhat are you trying to do?\u201dSong Jiaren watched Xia Xibei begin her tasks with a look of bewilderment.\u201cAre you fond of milk tea?\u201d Xia Xibei asked mysteriously.\u201cOf course I am!\u201d Song Jiaren nodded, her eyes lighting up immediately.But very quickly, she hung her head low in dejection. \u201cWho doesn\u2019t enjoy milk tea? But drinking a lot of it makes you fat.\u201dHow could she possibly not like milk tea? However, she could only fight back her craving for it whenever the thought of gaining weight after drinking milk tea hit her.She drank one cup of milk tea a month, at most, and it had to be a mildly sugared one.\u2014\u2014Although she didn\u2019t seem to lose any weight by doing so.\u201cIf there\u2019s a kind of milk tea that doesn\u2019t make you fat, would you want to have it?\u201d Xia Xibei asked again.\u201cOf course!\u201d Song Jiaren shot her an annoyed glance. \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t love milk tea that doesn\u2019t make them fat?\u201dMilk tea shops were all over the place these days and new recipes were being introduced relentlessly, but milk tea that wouldn\u2019t make people fat\u2026You had to be kidding!If such a milk tea existed for real, that shop would have been flooded by endless swarms of people by now!\u201cHold on then, I\u2019ll give you a surprise later.\u201dXia Xibei winked smugly at her, and then began to prepare herbs for the bath.Song Jiaren sat in the washtub, shrouded by the aroma of the herbs.Their scent was so soothing, she felt herself dozing off.Very soon, a sweet fragrance wafted through the air, instantly rejuvenating her.\u2014\u2014It was the smell of milk tea!The smell was sweet but not sickening, the fragrance rich and mellow with a refreshing tinge of tea leaves. It was truly mouthwatering.What was going on?As she recalled what Xia Xibei had said about milk tea moments ago, Song Jiaren was surprised.Could she really be making milk tea right now?Song Jiaren\u2019s doubt grew even more intense as the fragrance diffused through the place.Not even the aroma of herbs could conceal the tantalizing smell.A few minutes later, another refreshing whiff of herbal fragrance filled the air.The fragrance quickly blended with the scent of the milk tea, suppressing its sweetness and fusing together with the fragrance of the tea leaves.Song Jiaren could almost feel herself beginning to drool.\u201cBeibei, what are you doing?\u201d she asked, her voice slightly raised.\u201cYou\u2019ll see in a while!\u201d Xia Xibei yelled from the kitchen.Song Jiaren grimaced. It was such a torment!When she finally got to crawl out of the tub and put on her clothes, Xia Xibei emerged in front of her before she managed to head for the kitchen.Song Jiaren\u2019s eyes went saucer-wide as she saw the cup of light-brown liquid that Xia Xibei was holding in hand.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d\u201cMy homemade milk tea. Have a try.\u201dXia Xibei handed her the milk tea.Song Jiaren reached out with a hand but recoiled immediately, exclaiming, \u201cNo! That\u2019ll make me put on even more weight!\u201dShe had gone to great lengths to get rid of a few pounds over the past few days, and her facial features were finally looking slightly more conspicuous than before. How could she bear to let things go back to square one?Xia Xibei chuckled, \u201cDo you think I would let that happen? Don\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t put on any weight after drinking this!\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Song Jiaren looked at her skeptically. How could there be a milk tea that wouldn\u2019t make her fat?\u201cDrink it,\u201d Xia Xibei insisted, stuffing the cup into her hand.Song Jiaren took the cup somewhat reluctantly, but she was exhilarated inside.Putting aside her concerns for her weight, who wouldn\u2019t be delighted by the sight of milk tea?She took a careful sip, the smoothness of the drink as it went down her throat causing her to widen her eyes in surprise.She gulped down the rest of the milk tea, relishing the feeling greatly.Merrily, she exclaimed, \u201cDelicious!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72: Low-cal Milk TeaAlthough she couldn\u2019t drink milk tea often, Song Jiaren had tried quite a lot of them before. At least she hadn\u2019t missed out on the famous ones on the market.But she had to admit that the milk tea that Xia Xibei had just presented to her was very delicious, and in no way inferior to those on the market!The sweetness of milk blended very well with the mild fragrance of tea, giving it a sweet but not sickening taste. Furthermore, there was a light fragrance that couldn\u2019t be ignored, which enhanced the flavor of the milk tea to a whole new level.The texture of the drink was also splendid, without the slightest bit of bitterness, which kept you craving for another sip.\u201cIt\u2019s super delicious!\u201dSong Jiaren\u2019s eyes were wide with delightful surprise as she took another huge gulp, her lips curving into a smile of contentment.After taking a few gulps, she finally stopped and asked with some hesitation, \u201cAre you sure this won\u2019t make me fat?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d Xia Xibei nodded eagerly, flashing her a confident smile. \u201cThis has had herbs added to it, so it\u2019s extremely beneficial to the human body.\u201dSong Jiaren came to a sudden realization.\u201cThere\u2019s herbs in it? No wonder the taste is different!\u201dSo that was the reason it tasted different from all the milk teas she had drinken in the past!\u201cWhat kind of herbs?\u201d\u201cHoneysuckle, chrysanthemum\u2026\u201dSong Jiaren\u2019s eyes grew wider and wider.\u201cImpossible! It\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t had drinks made from those herbs before, but the taste is so different!\u201dPutting the rest aside, how could she not recognize the taste of chrysanthemum?\u201cOf course it tastes different,\u201d Xia Xibei replied with a smile, \u201cThey have all been processed, so the taste becomes altered.\u201dXia Xibei had a doctor of the Land of Fantasy with legendary skills in her second life; treating patients and making medication were only fundamentals to her.Medical approaches in the Land of Fantasy were similar to traditional medicine here in many ways, but there were also some differences.Moreover, approaches on that side were more profound and complete than they were over here, and Xia Xibei had acquired a lot of skills.At least in terms of integrating herbs, no one here could do it better than her.These could be considered her unique specialties. Unless she recruited an apprentice, no one else would possess the proficiencies that she had.Putting the rest aside, they could never mix honeysuckle with chrysanthemum without letting the taste of chrysanthemum take over.\u201cThat\u2019s marvelous!\u201dSong Jiaren stared at Xia Xibei in great awe and fascination.The mere thought of the herbal bath that she had formulated for her made her believe what Xia Xibei said.\u201cThe milk powder and sugar in it have also been dealt with. They are different from those commercially available, so they contain just one-tenth of the original calories.\u201dOne-tenth?!Song Jiaren was even more flabbergasted now.Although her weight loss efforts throughout the years hadn\u2019t yielded any results, that didn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t know anything.People who attempted to lose weight had to control their intake of sugar and calories. To achieve the best results, it was best for them to keep a wide berth from these things.Of course, a tiny bit of sugar wouldn\u2019t have any significant impact.And right now, this cup of milk tea only contained one-tenth of its usual calories\u2026 Which meant that it would take ten cups of this to achieve the same number of calories!But who drank ten cups of milk tea a day?For ordinary people, having a cup of milk tea every few days wouldn\u2019t affect the body in any visible ways.Therefore, the effects of drinking one cup of a low-calorie milk tea such as this one were even less noticeable!So Xia Xibei was right! This milk tea wouldn\u2019t make you fat at all!For those who loved milk tea and desserts, they would consume it often despite being aware that it would make them gain weight. If they knew that this milk tea wouldn\u2019t make them gain weight\u2026 They would go insane!\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll drink five cups a day!\u201d Song Jiaren proclaimed loudly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73: Opening a Store TogetherSong Jiaren was very excited.Who wouldn\u2019t like this kind of delicious and non-fattening food? It tasted incredible too!\u201cWhat do you think? Can I sell this at 20 yuan a cup?\u201d Xia Xibei asked with a smile.\u201cTwenty yuan? It\u2019s so cheap!\u201d Song Jiaren didn\u2019t hesitate to reply. \u201cIf it\u2019s 20 yuan a cup, I will buy it every day!\u201dSeeing Song Jiaren so excited, Xia Xibei couldn\u2019t help but clutch her forehead.She seemed to have asked the wrong person. Why would a rich person like Song Jiaren care about 20 or 30 yuan per cup?Prices today were different from a few years in the future.In a few years, a cup of good milk tea cost at least 15 yuan, and it was not uncommon for a cup to be 20 or 30 yuan.But the prices these days weren\u2019t so crazy. Today, a cup of milk tea was only seven or eight yuan, so if this cup sold for 20 yuan, wouldn\u2019t it scare people away?However, Xia Xibei was very confident in herself.Uniqueness was important when attempting to seize the market!This milk tea made by Xia Xibei was completely different from any other milk teas at the moment.Moreover, low-fat milk tea wasn\u2019t a trend yet. If this kind of milk tea appeared on the market, it would definitely attract the consumers\u2019 attention.Who didn\u2019t like healthy and delicious milk tea?Even guys who didn\u2019t like sweets would buy a cup of delicious milk tea when they went shopping, drinking it while walking.In the next few years, there would be milk tea shops opening everywhere. Such shops would even show up in remote towns.Xia Xibei was targeting the mid-to-high-end market, so the price positioning was different.After all, if the price of such a special milk tea was too low, people would not trust it!Moreover, City G was a metropolis. Even if it was not as prosperous as some provinces and cities, the local consumption level was not low.With that in mind, this price was reasonable.\u201cAre you going to open a store?\u201d Song Jiaren asked, finally understanding what was happening.Xia Xibei definitely had a plan if she was asking these questions.\u201cYes,\u201d Xia Xibei nodded. \u201cIf I did, would you support me?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d Song Jiaren nodded vigorously. \u201cThis milk tea is so delicious, and it\u2019s not fattening either. I will definitely buy it!\u201dThere were many other fat people besides her.Some were fat due to weak health or other reasons, but most of them became that way by overeating.Therefore, they generally liked high-calorie and high-sugar foods.Milk tea was also a high-calorie food, but what people liked wasn\u2019t the calories. It was the taste.If milk tea became low-calorie, everyone would become even more crazy about it!This way, no matter how much you drank, there would be no guilt!\u201cDo you want to partner with me?\u201dXia Xibei\u2019s words startled Song Jiaren. \u201cPartner?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Xia Xibei nodded, \u201cLet\u2019s open a store together.\u201dSong Jiaren was still a little lost.\u201cYou want to open a store with me?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Xia Xibei said once again. \u201c\u201dI\u2019ll provide the formula and we will invest in it together. The profit will be 50/50.\u201dJia Song was very curious, asking, \u201cWhy would you partner with me? And\u2026 50/50? You made the formula!\u201d\u201cBecause you are Song Jiaren,\u201d Xia Xibei confessed. \u201cIf I opened a store with you, it would save me a lot of trouble.\u201dHer candor made Song Jiaren silent, whose mood was a bit complicated.After a moment, she looked up. \u201cI need to discuss this with my parents. I will let you know later.\u201d\u201cAlright,\u201d Xia Xibei nodded.If Song Jiaren didn\u2019t want to partner with her, she could also do this by herself.However, it was too much trouble to do these things alone, so she chose to partner up with Song Jiaren.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She even made a few cups of milk tea for Jiaren to take home.Then, she began to focus on other matters.That evening, Xia Xibei received a call from Pan Yan.Over the phone, Pan Yan enthusiastically set up a meeting with her for tomorrow.The next day, Xia Xibei dressed up and went to Pan Yan\u2019s SY company.SY company was located in a building downtown. In a place where land was very expensive, the company had three floors, which showed that it was very well-off financially.SY company was quite well-known throughout the entertainment industry in the country of Hua. There were two first-tier stars in the company, many second- and third-tier artists, and even more lesser-known ones.However, they had never had a top star, let alone a queen who had gone to the international market.Of course, these things had nothing to do with Xia Xibei.In order for a company to develop, in addition to the top-tier, the foundation was indispensable.SY company recruited some trainees every year, receiving decent results in this area in recent years.When Pan Yan walked into the company with Xia Xibei, it attracted attention from many people.Although Pan Yan didn\u2019t have any great talents on hand right now, he was strong, and many people wanted to become his artists.However, his standard was very high, and not many people qualified.\u2014\u2014Of course, if someone\u2019s qualifications were very good, he would have to compete with others. After all, he was not the only agent in the company.So, he liked to start with newcomers.Everyone knew what he wanted, so the eyes that looked at Xia Xibei held intense scrutiny.However, after seeing her face, everyone understood Pan Yan\u2019s attitude.Pan Yan took Xia Xibei all the way inside the company, introducing the company\u2019s situation while doing so.\u201cOur company also has a dance studio and a recording studio. The facilities are comprehensive. Our trainee system is also very comprehensive, and as long as you pass the assessment, you can debut\u2026\u201dHe babbled about the company, but suddenly stopped.\u201cHello, Sister Xue,\u201d Pan Yan nodded politely to the woman in front of him.\u201cLittle Pan, this is\u2026\u201dWhen Bai Meixue looked at Xia Xibei, her eyes narrowed. Her expression was subtle, with a little bit of unknown shock.\u201cOh, this is the trainee I just found. I\u2019m showing her around the company,\u201d Pan Yan said seriously.A gleam of light flashed in Bai Meixue\u2019s eyes, and the smile on the corner of her mouth became even more subtle when she looked at the pretty young woman.\u201cOh, a new trainee. Very good.\u201dShe smiled kindly at Xia Xibei, introducing herself, \u201cHello, I\u2019m Bai Meixue.\u201d\u201cHello, I am Xia Xibei. I have seen your shows. Your acting is fantastic!\u201dXia Xibei showed her a bright smile, somewhat giving off the aura of a fan\u2019s excitement.The two were all smiles, but each had their own ideas.\u201cThank you.\u201d Bai Meixue was used to seeing fans\u2019 admiration and enthusiasm for her, so her smile remained unchanged. \u201cSince you are a trainee for the company, we will be colleagues from now on. Please help advise me.\u201d\u201cHow dare I?!\u201d Xia Xibei shook her head. \u201cYou are the trailblazer. I don\u2019t know anything!\u201dXia Xibei glanced at Xia Qinghan from the corner of her eye, but she sneered within her mind.Seeing Xia Xibei\u2019s somewhat timid appearance, Bai Meixue\u2019s smile deepened.\u201cBy the way, this is Xia Qinghan, and she will also be the company\u2019s trainee. Little Bei, you two can be good friends in the future!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She turned to look at Pan Yan, asking, \u201cBrother Pan, where shall we go later?\u201dBefore Pan Yan could reply, Bai Meixue said, \u201cWell, we are going to the dance studio right now. Do you want to come with us?\u201dBai Meixue had spoken up, so what could Pan Yan do?He looked at Xia Xibei, who nodded.\u201cOK, let\u2019s go,\u201d he replied.The group walked together, with Bai Meixue and Pan Yan walking in front and the two girls following behind them.Xia Qinghan looked at Xia Xibei, her mood very complicated.\u201cAre you really going to be a trainee?\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d Xia Xibei glanced at her with the same smile as before. \u201cI want to be a star and make a lot of money.\u201dThose words froze Xia Qinghan\u2019s smile. \u201cReally? But it\u2019s not that easy to become a star.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Xia Xibei said. \u201cI think I look pretty good, so there shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201dXia Qinghan\u2019s expression became stiff. However, she quickly smiled once again.\u201cBeing a star requires talent in addition to good looks. Do you have any talents?\u201d\u201cTalent?\u201d Xia Xibei looked innocent. \u201cWhat talent?\u201d\u201cSinging, dancing, musical instruments, acting\u2026\u201d\u201cSinging and dancing?\u201d Xia Xibei frowned. \u201cUm\u2026 I haven\u2019t tried it. I don\u2019t know if I could sing well enough, and I haven\u2019t danced before.\u201dOf course, Xia Qinghan knew that Xia Xibei had never been exposed to these activities.Liu Zhijing knew Xia Xibei, so she knew that she had no time to try these things, let alone play a musical instrument.Xia Qinghan was disdainful.What else did Xia Xibei have besides a pretty face? And she wanted to be a star? Please!With that thought, her smile became much more sincere.\u201cIt\u2019s alright! Just study hard after you become a trainee.\u201d\u201cOK.\u201d Xia Xibei\u2019s smile was also very sincere.Soon, they reached the dance room.The door of the dance studio was transparent, letting people see the inside of the room.Looking at the good-looking young men and women dancing to the music, Xia Xibei couldn\u2019t help but open her mouth wide.\u201cThis is amazing!\u201d she exclaimedHer reaction caused Xia Qinghan to open her mouth sarcastically. This girl was really a hillbilly, with no knowledge at all.Thinking of this, Xia Qinghan\u2019s hostility toward Xia Xibei faded.Besides a good-looking face, what else could she offer?It wasn\u2019t easy to become a star!Bai Meixue was also looking at Xia Xibei discreetly, and when she saw her exaggerated reaction, she was relieved too.However, when she saw Xia Xibei\u2019s pretty and familiar face, she didn\u2019t dare take her lightly.She didn\u2019t expect to see Xia Xibei here.If this face appeared on screen, it would easily attract suspicion.She had some speculation thinking of this.Then the group toured some other places.After the tour, Xia Xibei showed much enthusiasm, similar to the admiration of a hillbilly seeing the city.\u201cThis place is so big!\u201d\u201cYes. After you become a trainee here, you will often have the opportunity to enter these places. Now, if there are no problems, you can sign the trainee contract now.\u201dPan Yan had great confidence in Xia Xibei. She would definitely succeed!Bai Meixue looked at Xia Xibei with a smile, asking, \u201cYou and Qinghan are both in the same grade, so you\u2019re not 18 yet, right? In that case, you have to ask your parents to sign the contract.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She really didn\u2019t know about this.When she started in the industry back then, she was already in her twenties and was able to make her own decisions. She didn\u2019t need to ask for her parents\u2019 permission.But now, she was only 17 years old, not able to be in charge until she was 18 years old.\u201cDo I need my parents to sign the contract?\u201d\u201cOf course,\u201d Bai Meixue smiled, \u201cYou aren\u2019t an adult yet, and you can\u2019t decide many things. Therefore, your parents have to be present.\u201dXia Xibei looked at Pan Yan, but Pan Yan looked conflicted.\u201cActually, you don\u2019t need your parents to show up. Anyway, it\u2019s only the trainee stage\u2026\u201d\u201cLittle Pan, what you said is wrong.\u201d Bai Meixue\u2019s face was serious. \u201cThis is the company\u2019s regulations, which you should be aware of. Besides, there\u2019s things that have happened.\u201dPan Yan\u2019s expression was a little awkward.Some trainees had terminated their contract with the company after they became famous.The reason for the termination was that they were still minors when they had signed the contract. The company had misled the minors to sign an unequal treaty, so the contract could not be valid.Such things were really common.Therefore, when signing the contract, the potential trainee\u2019s parents must be there, so as not to lose the talent just when they became famous.\u201cLittle Bei, you can go back and talk to your parents. Ask them to come over and sign the contract later.\u201d Bai Meixue looked at Xia Xibei with a smile.\u201cOK,\u201d Xia Xibei said, forced to nod.However, she frowned inwardly. She hadn\u2019t expected this.Of course, she couldn\u2019t find her parents to sign the contract.She had already signed a severance letter with them, and if she went to them for help, it would be humiliating.However, if she did not go to her parents, then she could not be a trainee.Although she did not care about becoming a trainee, she still wanted to be in a competition eventually.\u201cGo back and discuss it with your parents first, then let us know when you reach a decision.\u201d\u201cOK.\u201dPan Yan led Xia Xibei out of the company. His expression was a bit uncomfortable.Bai Meixue was an elder-level figure at the company, but today\u2019s matters were not within her jurisdiction.However, Bai Meixue was one of the company leaders, so even if he was upset, he simply had to endure it.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, our company\u2019s contracts are very good. They are not as strict as those of other companies.\u201dLooking at Xia Xibei\u2019s subtle expression, he quickly explained, \u201cThe minimum contract for trainees here is two years, and the maximum is five years. At your age, you would sign for three years at most, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cOK. I understand. I\u2019ll think about it,\u201d Xia Xibei nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll go home now.\u201d\u201cAlright. Go talk to your parents about it.\u201dAfter saying goodbye to Pan Yan, Xia Xibei left SY company.Meanwhile, Xia Qinghan was still in Bai Meixue\u2019s office.Bai Meixue was now one of the shareholders of SY Company, so she had her own office.Her heart softened as she looked at the beautiful and neat Xia Qinghan.However, after thinking about Xia Xibei, her mood changed.\u201cDon\u2019t get too close to Xia Xibei in the future,\u201d she warned.Xia Qinghan was stunned for a moment.\u201cWhy?\u201dAlthough she didn\u2019t like Xia Xibei either, she was curious about Bai Meixue\u2019s sudden seriousness.\u201cYou are not from the same world. Don\u2019t let her drag you down.\u201dXia Qinghan blinked blankly but nodded, \u201cOkay, I understand.\u201dShe was a little happy.

If she really made her debut, she would be easily recognized.Thinking of this, Bai Meixue made a decision.Meanwhile, Xia Xibei wasn\u2019t aware that her presence had disturbed Bai Meixue. She had just received a call from Song Jiaren, inviting her over to the Songs\u2019 house.The Song family home was situated in a very high-end community with good security features. The family of three lived in a single-family, two-story villa.After her identity was verified, Xia Xibei successfully entered the subdivision.When she walked to the villa, she could see a few tall men coming out.These men looked fierce; they weren\u2019t people you wanted to provoke.The door was wide open. A tall woman stood at the doorway and happened to see Xia Xibei.The woman\u2019s eyes lit up when she saw Xia Xibei.\u201cYou\u2019re Xia Xibei, right?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m Xia Xibei.\u201dAs soon as Xia Xibei nodded, the woman quickly stepped forward and grabbed her hand. \u201cI\u2019m Jiaren\u2019s mom, you can call me Aunt Xin.\u201dShe looked at Xia Xibei with a smile, commenting, \u201cOh, you\u2019re so pretty!\u201d\u201cAunt Xin.\u201dIt was the first time Xia Xibei saw someone older than her be so excited to see her. she almost didn\u2019t know how to react.\u201cHmm\u2026 Jiaren is home, right?\u201d\u201cYes, yes! Come in, come in!\u201dFang Yongxin immediately brought her inside.The Song villa was very large, but Xia Xibei was surprised to find that the decorations were not as lavish as she had imagined.The decorations inside were refined, and the place felt like home. It was obvious that someone had put thought into it.\u201cCome, sit here!\u201d Fang Yongxin led her to the sofa and added with a smile, \u201cWait here, I will call Jiajia.\u201dThen, she turned and shouted towards the stairs.\u201cJiajia! Your classmate is here!\u201dThis shocked Xia Xibei greatly.While Fang Yongxin looked very gentle, this performance completely changed Xia Xibei\u2019s impression of her.Right. Fang Yongxin would not be so gentle to be able to raise a daughter like Song Jiaren.Besides, she was a gang leader\u2019s woman, although the gang leader had quit a long time ago.\u201cAye! I\u2019m here!\u201d Jiaren Song answered from upstairs, running down.\u201cBei Bei!\u201dJiaren Song leapt over happily and hugged Xia Xibei.\u201cMy parents agreed! We can open a store together!\u201dSong Jiaren was so excited that she almost smothered Xia Xibei.\u201cPlease, don\u2019t be so worked up,\u201d Xia Xibei said, quickly pushing her away, \u201cJust tell me calmly.\u201dThere was a coughing sound nearby. Xia Xibei turned around and saw a middle-aged man with an imposing appearance.The man was about 40 years old, the best age for a man. He was quite handsome too.His facial features were similar to Song Jiaren\u2019s, with a strong aura around him. One could tell he was successful.\u201cJiajia.\u201d Song Tianqin looked serious. \u201cSpeak well.\u201dSong Jiaren gave him a silly smile and sat off to the side.Fang Yongxin came out with a plate with cake and beverages beside it, insisting, \u201cCome on, drink something first.\u201dJiaren Song stared, accusing her, \u201cMom! You\u2019re eating cake again!\u201dFang Yongxin coughed lightly, an innocent look on her face. \u201cThis was a gift from someone. I couldn\u2019t just refuse it.\u201dSong Jiaren looked at her unhappily, with only one meaning in her gaze\u2013 yeah right, keep on making up stories!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Let\u2019s not talk about such depressing things!\u201dThen she handed Xia Xibei a cup of milk tea. \u201cCome, try my recipe!\u201d\u201cI want one too,\u201d Song Jiaren said unhappily.\u201cWhat are you talking about? Aren\u2019t you on a diet? You can\u2019t have any,\u201d Fang Yongxin refused without any hesitation.Song Jiaren was speechless.She was obviously her real mom!After Fang Yongxin refused her daughter, she put the cake in front of Xia Xibei.\u201cCome and try the cake. This cake shop\u2019s creations are delicious!\u201dWhen she said delicious, her eyes seemed to glow.The corners of Xia Xibei\u2019s mouth twitched. She felt as if Aunt Xin was trying to feed her.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Aunt Xin. I can feed myself.\u201d\u201cMom, she knows how to eat!\u201d Song Jiaren was clutching her forehead in resignation.She had known that when Xia Xibei visited, she would be greeted very warmly.What could she do? Fang Yongxin was very into external appearances.Her level of enthusiasm was directly correlated to the appearance of the other person. If someone had an ordinary appearance, she would not be rude, but neither would she be enthusiastic to meet them.Song Tianqin, who was next to them, finally spoke up, \u201cYongxin, enough. Let\u2019s talk business first.\u201dFang Yongxin rolled her eyes at the father and daughter duo. \u201cBei Bei is so thin, she\u2019s different from you!\u201dSong Jiaren simply stared at her mother in silence. It was heartbreaking!\u201cIt\u2019s okay, don\u2019t worry. Let\u2019s eat the cake first!\u201d Fang Yongxin turned to Xia Xibei once again. \u201cYou are so thin; you must eat more!\u201dXia Xibei was about to be overwhelmed by her enthusiasm. She quickly replied, \u201cAunt Xin, I can do it myself. Actually, I\u2019m not very hungry. Let\u2019s talk business first.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s eat and talk!\u201d Fang Yongxin replied.Xia Xibei could only nod.After Xia Xibei had a few bites of cake and drank half a cup, Song Tianqin finally spoke up again.\u201cThis cup of milk tea and the one you made\u2026 Which one do you think is better?\u201dXia Xibei smiled. \u201cAunt Xin\u2019s recipe is very good, but I still think mine tastes better.\u201dSince she was here, she would not mince words.\u201cMy milk tea is different from the ones sold on the market. It has a special formula, a better taste, and lower calories too.\u201dSeeing her confidence, Song Tianqin felt a little admiration for her.When Song Jiaren came home last night, she also brought back a few cups of milk tea.He had thought it was just ordinary milk tea, so he hadn\u2019t expected more things.Moreover, Song Jiaren had also told them all that Xia Xibei had said.When he heard that Xia Xibei wanted to partner with Song Jiaren and open a store, Song Tianqin\u2019s first instinct was to question her intentions.Many people had tried to get close to Song Jiaren after knowing her identity, and Song Tianqin had never been weak in dealing with these malicious people.He didn\u2019t think Xia Xibei would be this forthcoming.And she had helped Song Jiaren lose weight!Song Jiaren\u2019s weight-loss challenge had been troubling their whole family, but it had not been effective.But after only a few days in Xia Xibei\u2019s company, the changes in Song Jiaren were visible to the naked eye.She had lost almost 10 catties in just a few days!Although the effect was significant partially because of Song Jiaren\u2019s high initial weight, it still showcased Xia Xibei\u2019s ability.This was why Song Tianqin had asked Xia Xibei to come over.Now that he had met her, he realized that his understanding of Xia Xibei was still very shallow.Setting aside her beautiful appearance, just her confident and open attitude was enough to make Song Tianqin value her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Can I ask how they are made?\u201dEven if they had not been exposed to milk teas, who didn\u2019t know that milk tea was high in calories?\u201cJia Jia may have already told you that a lot of herbs have been added to it.\u201dSong Tianqin was even more puzzled.\u201cJust with the addition of herbs? But there is no medicinal taste to it.\u201d\u201cThat is the secret recipe,\u201d Xia Xibei said, smiling confidently. \u201cIf we collaborate, I will show you the formula.\u201dOf course, if they didn\u2019t collaborate, there was no need to show the formula.Song Tianqin understood this. He then asked, \u201cI heard Jia Jia say that you only want 50% of the shares?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Xia Xibei nodded. \u201cAfter all, I\u2019m just a student, and I usually have a lot of things to do. Even if we collaborated, I can\u2019t do too much. The 50% shares are considered the benefits of the formula.\u201dSong Tianqin\u2019s gaze was unfathomable. \u201cYou are not afraid that once we have made money, we will kick you out?\u201d\u201cDad!\u201dSong Jiaren, who was sitting next to them, sounded unhappy.Unexpectedly, Xia Xibei laughed.\u201cIt seems that Uncle is quite confident in this business and thinks it can make a lot of money.\u201d She smiled brightly. \u201cIf the partnership was really broken up, it won\u2019t be a problem. After all, if I have this formula, naturally I can make more.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Song Tianqin\u2019s eyes lit up, \u201cSo you have more ideas?\u201d\u201cOf course. You may have heard about my story from Jia Jia. I believe that my medical skills are decent. These milk teas are just the beginning, so people won\u2019t get fat after drinking them. I will then introduce a milk tea that can help people lose weight after drinking it.\u201dThese words made everyone in the Song family widen their eyes.Milk tea for weight loss? Was she joking?Milk tea was always fattening! How could it make people lose weight?Xia Xibei\u2019s smile deepened as she continued, \u201cOf course, since I dare say this, I am sure about it.\u201dMoreover, there were some things she didn\u2019t say.Selling milk tea was just for early capital accumulation. She had more ideas and plans for the future stages.Song Tianqin stared at Xia Xibei with an intense gaze for a while, before suddenly smiling.\u201cWow, it\u2019s awesome to be young!\u201dHe had asked people to check Xia Xibei\u2019s background, and it was obvious that she was a poor kid who was not loved by her parents. How could she have such a talent?But he also understood that there were many things in this world that could not be explained by common sense. As long as Xia Xibei was not mean-hearted and wouldn\u2019t harm Song Jiaren, he didn\u2019t need to know everything.He began laughing, adding on, \u201cGreat! Now we can talk about what comes next.\u201dXia Xibei was overjoyed, but her face remained unchanged. \u201cOkay, then I will get help from you, Uncle.\u201dWhen Song Jiaren, who sat on the side and saw the decision being made after a quick discussion, couldn\u2019t help but be dumbfounded.This was decided just like that?Fang Yongxin glanced at her daughter in disdain, then said with a smile on her face, \u201cSince we are so happy here, I will cook. Let\u2019s celebrate properly!\u201d\u201cThank you, Aunt Xin.

They didn\u2019t have time to be busy with these kinds of things.Xia Xibei did not feel guilty at all about getting 50% of the profit.After all, this milk tea shop relied on her unique formula to open up, and she would continue to introduce more formulations in the future.As for Song Jiaren, she was an only child, so it was fine to give her the money.In fact, for the Song family, this was just a shop opened with Song Jiaren\u2019s pocket money, and the final profits belonged to her.Although Song Jiaren was very young and had family money, who wouldn\u2019t want to have more money?The reason they wanted Xia Xibei to visit was to see what she was truly like.Now that they were sure that she was harmless, they would not stop their daughter from associating with her.Song Jiaren had few good friends her age to begin with.Even though she had an entourage at school, it wasn\u2019t the same.And Xia Xibei was the first friend Song Jiaren had invited home, so they wanted to treat her well.Moreover, with their many years of experience, they could see that Xia Xibei\u2019s future would be extraordinary!Becoming friends with such people was good for Song Jiaren.Therefore, the Song family was very enthusiastic. When Xia Xibei was about to leave, Song Tianqin wanted to have someone take her home, but Xia Xibei refused.The two homes were not far apart, and Xia Xibei wanted to check out the shops on the way.Although she didn\u2019t need to think too much about the business going forward, she wouldn\u2019t really be totally hands-off either.In this case, Song Tianqin and Fang Yongxin did not insist but just walked her out.After Xia Xibei left, Song Tianqin turned to his daughter.\u201cIn the future, get along well with her and learn from her!\u201dSong Jiaren felt very conflicted about her father\u2019s advice.She was a little happy and a little upset.It was good that her friend was approved by her father. However, she felt that after Xia Xibei came to her house, her status in the family had plummeted!With her mom, it was always about looks, so she had nothing to say.But her dad also valued Xia Xibei, which made her feel a little complicated.\u201cWe don\u2019t usually interfere with your friendships, but incidents like the one with that boy can\u2019t be repeated.\u201dThese words made Song Jiaren look up suddenly in shock.\u201cUh\u2026\u201dThey knew about Yang Xuan?!\u201cYou are grown up now, and you should learn to distinguish between good and bad.\u201d Song Tianqin patted his daughter on the shoulder. \u201cIf we lecture too much, you will be annoyed, so just think about it on your own.\u201dHer father\u2019s words silenced Song Jiaren for a long time, her mind full of thoughts.Xia Xibei didn\u2019t know about this development. When she returned home, she began to work on the new milk tea.When she arrived at school on Monday, she saw Song Jiaren excitedly rushing towards her.\u201cBei Bei!\u201dLooking at Song Jiaren\u2019s bright smile, Xia Xibei was a little lost.

Instead, she kept asking, the malice on her face unconcealed.Xia Xibei finally smiled, and the corners of her lips lifted.\u201cOh? Has the injury caused by Yang Xuan\u2019s mother healed yet? You\u2019ve recovered so quickly. Which hospital was it that treated your wound? Please tell us.\u201dAs soon as these words came out, Jin Yazhen\u2019s smile suddenly stiffened.Only a few days had passed since the incident, and it was still a hot topic.Jin Yazhen also knew that many people wanted to see her be embarrassed.But that did not stop her from watching Xia Xibei make a fool of herself.Besides, if Xia Xibei did make a fool of herself, it would divert everyone\u2019s attention from her.Unexpectedly, Xia Xibei had poked at her weak spot as soon as she spoke up.\u201cBy the way, when I saw Yang Xuan last week, he seemed to be injured. Why didn\u2019t you show your concern for him? He has spent so much money on you. Why are you so heartless?\u201dThese words petrified Jin Yazhen.\u201cWhat\u2026 What are you talking about?!\u201d After regaining her composure, she was struck by shame and anger. \u201cI have nothing to do with him!\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Xia Xibei showed a wicked smile as she took out her phone.Seeing the newest model phone that Xia Xibei was holding, one question immediately arose in Jin Yazhen\u2019s mind \u2013 where had Xia Xibei gotten the money to buy such a phone?But soon, she no longer had the heart to think about this issue, because Xia Xibei had opened a photo album and clicked on a particular photo.\u201cYou guys are so intimate here, so how can you have nothing to do with him?\u201dWhen Jin Yazhen saw the photo, her pupils constricted and her heart stopped beating for a second.She looked at the two people in the photo in disbelief, her mind blank.How had Xia Xibei gotten these photos?!She had already deleted these photos herself! Or could Xia Xibei have gotten them from Yang Xuan?The people close to them had also seen the photo, immediately rushing over.\u201cWow! My god! So you two really are a couple!\u201dThe two people in the photo could be seen very clearly, and no one would ever mistake their identities.More people gathered over, and after seeing those photos, everyone was shocked.Jin Yazhen had explained to them earlier that it was Yang Xuan\u2019s mother who had misunderstood the situation, causing all those events.But now\u2026 This face slapping was really aggressive!\u201cIt\u2019s you! You photoshopped it! You are framing me!\u201dSeeing everyone\u2019s reaction, Jin Yazhen became anxious, and scrambled to come up with an explanation.Looking at Jin Yazhen, who refused to admit the truth, Xia Xibei smiled and opened a video. \u201cIs that so? Have I also photoshopped this?\u201dAs soon as the video started playing, Jin Yazhen\u2019s face turned ash white.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The duo was singing and dancing in it, occasionally kissing too.\u201cIt\u2019s really you two!\u201dEveryone was stunned.If it were a photo, they might have believed it was photoshopped. But this was a video!\u201cIf there\u2019s still people who don\u2019t believe it, feel free to search the Internet yourselves using the keywords. Trust me, there will be more surprises!\u201d Xia Xibei smiled innocently at everyone.Xia Xibei didn\u2019t have the time to care about Jin Yazhen, but Jin Yazhen had to show up and seek her own death, so she couldn\u2019t be blamed for her actions.The other students did not wait for Xia Xibei to say anything more, immediately taking out their phones and searching for those videos.Jin Yazhen\u2019s face went pale and she couldn\u2019t utter a word, hurrying to the toilet.When she took out her phone, logged into her account on this website, and went to delete the videos, she realized that the number of views had already increased by a lot!\u2018I\u2019m done for!\u2019Jin Yazhen\u2019s heart turned cold.When she was with Yang Xuan, she loved watching content like this on the Internet.Having watched so many of them, she also wanted to shoot one herself. It wasn\u2019t for the sake of popularity, just for memories.So, she grabbed Yang Xuan and shot a couple of short videos.However, because of their awkward acting, stiff expressions, and poor shooting skills, they got very few views after these videos were uploaded.In addition, there were not many members on this site, so not many people had watched these videos.She had never expected Xia Xibei to find out about these videos!Was she a devil?! How would she know these things?!When Jin Yazhen returned to the classroom, the surrounding students looked at her with sarcasm in their eyes.You said that you didn\u2019t know Yang Xuan? What a lie!And the most disgusting thing was that she had slandered Xia Xibei for being together with Yang Xuan!This person was really shameless!Several classmates had already downloaded the videos before she had found out about it. Even if some of them didn\u2019t download it, they would also have taken screenshots.Seeing everyone\u2019s reaction, Jin Yazhen\u2019s hands and feet felt extremely heavy, as if they were filled with cement.When she returned to her seat, she couldn\u2019t hold it anymore. She laid her head down on the table and cried silently.Xia Xibei ignored her completely because she knew that Jin Yazhen would seek her own death sooner or later.Besides, she still had other goods on Jin Yazhen.She wasn\u2019t in a hurry.Other people looked at Jin Yazhen in even more disdain.She wanted to bite someone, but was bitten back in the end, so she deserved this!Xia Xibei didn\u2019t say anything, taking out a book and continuing to read.For her, although she had won fifth place this time, it was still not good enough. She needed to continue working harder.Tang Luo looked at her with a weird expression.However, he said nothing and quietly looked down at his own book.As for the other students, their attention had now shifted to the tea between Jin Yazhen and Yang Xuan, and they no longer cared about Xia Xibei.In the first class, the Chinese teacher came over.Seeing Xia Xibei, the teacher gave her a satisfied smile.\u201cIn this assessment, our class\u2019s results were not bad, and a few students have made great progress. I hope everyone can get rid of their arrogance and rashness and continue to maintain these good grades!\u201dSuch words were repeated by different teachers in the next few lessons.After the head teacher passed down the score sheet, everyone was surprised to see that Xia Xibei was ranked second.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Xia Xibei really ranked fifth this time, and Xia Qinghan was only sixth!\u201d\u201cNo way!\u201d Another boy was surprised too. \u201cHow come my goddess only ranked sixth?\u201dXia Qinghan was generally in the top five of the cohort, but this time she had fallen to sixth?Although everyone in the top 20 of the cohort could safely get into the best universities, Xia Qinghan had always been in the top five before!\u201cThe rankings of the first few students did not change, it\u2019s just that Xia Xibei suddenly appeared.\u201dOnce these words were out, everyone seemed to be struck by a sudden realization.It was Xia Xibei who had taken away Xia Qinghan\u2019s fifth place?Everyone looked at Xia Xibei with eyes that seemed to be fitted with a microscope, scrutinizing her from head to toe.\u201cSomething\u2019s not right. Her past grades were not so good, so how had she suddenly become fifth?\u201dAs soon as someone said this, everyone\u2019s expressions became a little strange.\u201cOh yes! When Xia Xibei took the exam, she was in the same room as Xia Qinghan!\u201d\u201cNot only were they in the same room, they also sat really close, just across the aisle!\u201dEveryone\u2019s expressions became even stranger.\u201cIs it\u2026\u201dWhile they were discussing this, a cold voice suddenly sounded out.\u201cEven if you can\u2019t get such good results yourselves, don\u2019t assume that others can\u2019t do it either.\u201dEveryone turned their heads to look at the person talking and were met with a pair of cold eyes.It was Tang Luo.Some of them were about to scold the person who had spoken, but after seeing Tang Luo, they immediately shut their mouths.There was no particular reason, it was just that although Tang Luo was Xia Xibei\u2019s desk mate, he was the first in the cohort!Tang Luo had only been in the middle rankings before, but two months ago, he suddenly jumped to the top!There were lots of straight-A students in their Qing Ye High School, so it was a nearly impossible feat to rank first so suddenly!At that time, there were also people who raised doubts, but because Tang Luo had been wandering away from the crowd, nobody delved into the matter too much.The first time, everyone still had suspicions, but after the second time, everyone stopped doubting.Ever since that particular exam, whether it was a monthly or mid-term assessment, his name had firmly occupied the top of the list, giving them no reason to doubt him.Therefore, as soon as he spoke up, everyone stopped their discussions.Tang Luo glanced coldly at these people who were gossiping and walked away.Looking at his thin back, everyone stared at each other. They could no longer voice out their suspicions as they had just now.Think about it carefully now, Xia Xibei and Tang Luo were desk mates, so it didn\u2019t seem impossible that she had suddenly become so good at academics!After all, Tang Luo had done the same!Besides, when the next monthly assessment came, they would know if her grades were real or fake.The gossip had stopped here, but Xia Qinghan was in a bad mood.She stared at the photo on her phone closely, which showed the rankings. The two names, stacked one above the other, made her extremely unhappy.Xia Xibei!She had actually ranked higher than her!And even more hateful was that Xia Xibei had scored two marks more than her in every subject.Two marks!She didn\u2019t know if Xia Xibei had done this intentionally or unintentionally, but this kind of difference in scores made Xia Qinghan very annoyed.Was it possible that she really had some sort of grudge going on with Xia Xibei?Otherwise, how could this have happened?!Tao Yueying was also very indignant beside her.\u201cThis Xia Xibei has really gone too far! She\u2019s too shameless! She must have cheated!\u201dXia Qinghan suddenly turned her head and looked in Tao Yueying\u2019s direction.\u201cCheated?\u201dTao Yueying nodded, \u201cI asked around. Xia Xibei had been hovering around two or three hundred ranks before, so how could she suddenly have reached fifth place?! There must be something wrong going on here!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84: Frame-up (1)Tao Yueying really felt that Xia Xibei must have cheated to get such a high score.Xia Xibei was only mid-ranking before. For her to suddenly reach the top five, Tao Xueying refused to believe that there wasn\u2019t something fishy going on!\u201cWeren\u2019t you in the same room as her during the exam, and weren\u2019t you sitting really close to her too?\u201d Tao Yueying appeared very serious, as if a detective analyzing evidence. \u201cDuring the exam, did you notice anything wrong about her?\u201dXia Qinghan was silent for a while.\u201cI\u2026 I didn\u2019t pay attention to her. I had to focus on my own exam.\u201dTao Yueying clapped her hands, \u201cThat must be it! She copied your test paper when you weren\u2019t paying attention! That\u2019s how she got such a score!\u201d\u201cYes! That must be the case!\u201d Liu Zhijing nodded. \u201cThis kind of person is too disgusting! She\u2019s using you as her steppingstone to get to the top!\u201dXia Qinghan couldn\u2019t help nodding, as if she thought so too.But she couldn\u2019t be too obvious, so she hesitated and said, \u201cBut we don\u2019t have any evidence. Even if we got the test paper, we can\u2019t do anything if she doesn\u2019t admit to it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright, leave this to me!\u201d Liu Zhijing smiled, her eyes flickering.\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201dLiu Zhijing smiled slightly, her eyes sharp. \u201cI\u2019m going to find the evidence, of course!\u201d\u201cBut what if\u2026 There is no evidence?\u201d Xia Qinghan couldn\u2019t help asking.\u201cNo evidence? Impossible!\u201d Liu Zhijing snorted. \u201cI will definitely teach her a lesson!\u201d\u2018Xia Xibei, don\u2019t think that you can be arrogant after hanging out with Song Jiaren! Don\u2019t be so naive!\u2019When Liu Zhijing thought of Yang Xuan, who had been beaten up so badly that he couldn\u2019t even come to school, a fire rose within her heart.Of course, it was not because she cared about Yang Xuan, but because he had failed to regain Song Jiaren\u2019s favor. Instead, her relationship with Xia Xibei was getting better and better. How could she not feel angry?Besides, Xia Xibei\u2019s grades made her very uncomfortable. After all, she only ranked 20 plus.This ranking was very good, but Xia Xibei had ranked fifth!She wouldn\u2019t allow this!Thinking of this, the fire in Liu Zhijing\u2019s heart rose even higher.Xia Qinghan and Tao Yueying looked at each other, both very curious.\u201cWhat is your plan?\u201d Tao Yueying asked.\u201cYingying, do you have the bracelet that you bought?\u201d Liu Zhijing asked.\u201cAre you talking about this one?\u201d Tao Yueying raised her wrist, revealing a beautiful and delicate bracelet.\u201cYes! That\u2019s it!\u201d Liu Zhijing nodded, then whispered, \u201cI\u2019m planning to put this bracelet in her bag, and then\u2026\u201dShe raised her eyebrows at them, her expression smug.\u201cWhat?!\u201d Tao Yueying was shocked. \u201cYou are framing\u2026\u201dLiu Zhijing covered her mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t shout!\u201dXia Qinghan was also taken aback. She did not expect Liu Zhijing to have such thoughts.But she quickly turned happy.She could not wait to see Xia Xibei be embarrassed.Liu Zhijing took her hand off of Tao Yueying\u2019s mouth, explaining, \u201cAs long as we find your bracelet in her bag, everyone will know that she is a thief. Then, is it not normal for her to cheat?\u201dTao Yueying and Xia Qinghan were both stunned by these words.This seemed to make a lot of sense.\u201cIf we just say that she cheated, she will definitely deny it. So, let\u2019s make her unable to argue against us!\u201d Liu Zhijing\u2019s smile became colder. \u201cWe\u2019ll nail her down!\u201dTao Yueying was a little worried. \u201cBut we are in different classes with her. How do we put it in her bag?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I have a way,\u201d Liu Zhijing smiled confidently.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They were not far away from each other and could see each other\u2019s situation.After the groups disbanded, Liu Zhijing and Tao Yueying gave each other a wink.Tao Yueying nodded, then followed Xia Xibei quietly.Xia Xibei was about to head back to the classroom. She was introverted before and was not close to other students. Although she was no longer introverted, she still had no intention of being too close to them.Anyway, physical education was not a compulsory lesson, so she chose to go back to the classroom.Unexpectedly, she bumped into someone at a turn.When she looked up, she found that it was Tao Yueying.Tao Yueying frowned and looked at her with displeasure.\u201cWhat bad luck,\u201d she muttered before snorting and leaving without looking back.Xia Xibei looked at her back, her eyes narrowing slightly.If it were anyone else, she wouldn\u2019t have thought too much into it, but Tao Yueying was Xia Qinghan\u2019s loyal follower.So, seeing this seemingly normal scene, she did not believe it was really normal.Besides, although this was indeed a turn, it shouldn\u2019t be such a coincidence that they would bump into each other.Pondering over the tricks they might be playing, she couldn\u2019t help but laugh.Did they really think that she was a fool?The corners of Xia Xibei\u2019s mouth lifted slightly and she continued to walk towards the classroom.On the other side, Tao Yueying screamed after playing around with other female classmates for a while.\u201cHuh? Where\u2019s my bracelet?!\u201dHer scream immediately attracted the attention of other students.\u201cBracelet? Is that the one you were wearing this morning?\u201d someone asked.\u201cYes, it\u2019s the limited-edition bracelet endorsed by Brother Yu! I spent so much effort getting it!\u201dAfter hearing this, all the other girls were shocked.\u201cIs that the limited-edition bracelet endorsed by He Xuanyu?! My God! That must be expensive!\u201d\u201cI wanted to buy it too, but I gave up when I saw the price. Yueying, you actually bought it?\u201d\u201cYes, it cost me nearly 10,000 yuan!\u201d Tao Yueying looked around anxiously. \u201cPlease help me to find it!\u201dEveryone reacted immediately, starting to look around for it.But after searching for a while, they found nothing.\u201cCould someone have taken it?\u201d someone whispered.\u201cAh!\u201d Tao Yueying immediately exclaimed, \u201cI think I know!\u201dEveryone immediately asked, \u201cWhat did you remember?\u201dTao Yueying looked confused, telling them, \u201cSomeone bumped into me just now.\u201dShe knew the art of speech, saying that someone had bumped into her, and not her who had bumped into someone else.\u201cThen what?\u201d Liu Zhijing asked immediately.\u201cAfter that, I felt that my hand was a bit weird, but I didn\u2019t think too much about it at the time,\u201d Tao Yueying frowned, looking a little confused and uncertain. \u201cBut maybe I\u2019m wrong?\u201dLiu Zhijing was anxious, asking, \u201cWho bumped into you?\u201d\u201cXia Xibei of Class 3.\u201d\u201cXia Xibei?\u201dThe other students glanced at each other in surprise.They had some impressions of Xia Xibei, mainly that she was really good-looking.How could a girl who was better-looking than Xia Qinghan not be noticeable?Besides, they had also heard that she had ranked fifth in the cohort in the recent assessment!\u201cBut this should not be a problem, should it?\u201d someone asked hesitantly.Even if Xia Xibei did bump into her, that did not mean she had anything to do with the loss of the bracelet.No one dared to voice that this matter might be directly related to Xia Xibei.\u201cBut why would she bump into you for no reason? The hallway was so wide! Forget it, let me ask around.\u201dLiu Zhijing looked around, her eyes lighting up upon seeing someone.\u201cJin Yazhen, come here!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What did she steal?\u201d Some of the attentive ones caught that word, their eyes growing very wide. \u201cShe stole things?\u201d\u201cNo- Nothing!\u201d Jin Yazhen put on an apprehensive look, as if she had spilled a secret that she shouldn\u2019t have, hastily clasping her mouth. \u201cI-I didn\u2019t say that!\u201d1\u201cStop covering up for her!\u201d Liu Zhijing put on a righteous front. \u201cWhy are you still being so good to her when she treated you like that! She\u2019s not worth it!\u201dJin Yazhen hung her head low, looking like a damsel in distress.A while later, she spoke in a very soft voice, \u201cShe has stolen some chains at a jewelry store before\u2026\u201d\u201cChains?!\u201d Tao Yueying exclaimed in shock, \u201cShe likes chains?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Jin Yazhen nodded. \u201cShe loves jewelry, but she can\u2019t afford it. I\u2019ve given her a few necklaces and bracelets before, but I never thought that she would actually steal the things that she likes\u2026\u201dTao Yueying gasped sharply, then proclaimed confidently, \u201cThen she was definitely the one who stole my bracelet!\u201dThe looks on all of their faces changed upon hearing her claim.If it was true, then a girl like Xia Xibei was just downright obnoxious, wasn\u2019t she?\u201cWe can\u2019t just sit here anymore. Let\u2019s go look for her and find out the truth!\u201dWith a wave of her hand, Liu Zhijing strode forward.The rest of them exchanged glances, getting the feeling that the current situation was somewhat bizarre.However, if even Jin Yazhen said that Xia Xibei had stolen things before, then it shouldn\u2019t be wrong.Moreover, Tao Yueying\u2019s bracelet cost ten thousand yuan!He Xuanyu was one of the most popular young celebrities at the moment, and the products he endorsed were all expensive. However, whenever a new endorsement was made public, fans from all over the country would break their necks trying to get it.You wouldn\u2019t get it if you weren\u2019t fast enough, even if you had the money!So the bracelet wasn\u2019t just a matter of money, it was a pretty meaningful object!If the bracelet was theirs, they would panic terribly too!As this thought occurred to them, they quickly followed Liu Zhijing as she marched off.This group of people stomped all the way to the classroom of Third Form.There weren\u2019t many people in the classroom, all of whom couldn\u2019t help but be shocked when they saw the group of fuming girls that had just appeared.\u201cXia Xibei!\u201d Tao Yueying dashed toward Xia Xibei, growling furiously with a straight face, \u201cDid you take my bracelet?!\u201dA commotion broke out among the crowd when her words sounded out like a bolt of thunder.All eyes were pinned on them now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You\u2019re being so nice to her, but she won\u2019t even appreciate it!\u201dThe disdain in Xia Xibei\u2019s eyes intensified as she watched the two of them sing the same tune.\u201cXia Xibei, we have no intention of taking such radical measures. It\u2019s just that the bracelet really means a lot to Yueying!\u201d Xia Qinghan looked at her with sincerity. \u201cCould you please return it to her?\u201dXia Xibei snorted at Xia Qinghan\u2019s admonishing words. \u201cYou guys are hilarious. You ran to me and claimed that I stole her bracelet. Are y\u2019all brainless or something?\u201d\u201cIt was you who stole my bracelet!\u201d Tao Yueying argued furiously. \u201cMy bracelet went missing right after you bumped into me!\u201dXia Xibei sized up Tao Yueying with a measuring glance. \u201cYou really have no brains, do you? It was you who bumped into me just now! I haven\u2019t even settled it with you, and now you\u2019re accusing me instead?\u201dTao Yueying replied boldly and righteously, \u201cIt was you who bumped into me! People like you\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with people like me?\u201d Xia Xibei looked at her nonchalantly. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to say that poor people like me would want to take possession of the things I like, aren\u2019t you?\u201dTao Yueying got tongue-tied all of a sudden, at a loss for words.Although that was what she was thinking, it felt somewhat wrong when Xia Xibei said it out loud.Liu Zhijing stood up, declaring, \u201cCut the nonsense!

Because of her looks?Tang Luo looked towards Tao Yueying and the rest. Ungraciously, he stated, \u201cSomething like this has happened, but you didn\u2019t look for the teachers or call the cops. Instead, you came here to make a big scene. Are all of you legal illiterates?\u201d\u201cNot just that,\u201d Xia Xibei added, \u201cFrom what I see, they think that the school is their home and they are free to do whatever they feel like. The rest of us, we don\u2019t even have the right to speech, do we?\u201dThe conversation between the two of them put dismal looks on the faces of the girls, making them seem embarrassed and awkward.Now that Tang Luo had said things in such a way, they were at a loss for what to do next.Liu Zhijing gritted her teeth, cursing him in her mind, \u2018God d*mn Tang Luo, what do these girls\u2019 affairs have to do with him?\u2019Since when had the two of them become so close?Tang Luo was the top student and the face of the school.Although he didn\u2019t have a tall and hunky build, his cold, aloof temperament, his extremely outstanding results, and his impressive talent in sports were enough to make a lot of girls fall for him.He was one of the most popular guys in school!Although they heard that he didn\u2019t come from a wealthy family, the rest of his qualities were eye-catching and remarkable enough to put him in the center of attention.However, he chose to take Xia Xibei\u2019s side!As she looked at Xia Xibei\u2019s face, Liu Zhijing gnawed her teeth in rage.\u201cIn fact, we prefer to deal with the matter behind closed doors.\u201dXia Qing stood up.\u201cThey only talked nonsense because they were anxious. I don\u2019t believe that Xia Xibei would steal things, but that bracelet cost ten thousand yuan and it\u2019s meaningful\u2026 So I\u2019d just like to know if Xia Xibei happened to come across a bracelet. If you could return it to us, we\u2019ll be very grateful!\u201dHer words put a sarcastic sneer on Xia Xibei\u2019s lips.\u201cEnough! Cut the sweet talk. No matter how you put it, you still think I was the one who stole your bracelet, don\u2019t you? I\u2019m telling you for the last time, I did not steal it! Besides, this is the classroom of Third Form. If you aren\u2019t students in our class, please leave!\u201dTao Yueying got anxious when she saw how adamantly Xia Xibei was behaving.She was certain that she had taken the bracelet.However, now that Xia Xibei was reluctant to let them search her bag, and Tang Luo was watching them at the side too, they couldn\u2019t just do it by force.Xia Qinghan couldn\u2019t help but scowl as well.They knew that it was wrong to search her body and her bag by force.But if they didn\u2019t do it, their plan would be foiled, wouldn\u2019t it?If they had known all of this beforehand, they would have laid out a much more detailed and feasible plan.The current situation was a bit too awkward.Luckily, the discipline master arrived and broke the tension in the classroom.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dThe discipline master wore a look of displeasure as he looked at the students in the classroom. \u201cWhat are you fussing on about here rather than studying?\u201dUpon seeing the discipline master, Liu Zhijing became agitated right away.\u201cTeacher! We lost a bracelet that cost ten thousand!\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201dThe discipline master was stunned as well.The school would be concerned if even a hundred yuan was lost, let alone a bracelet that cost ten thousand.He walked up to them hurriedly, questioning them, \u201cWhat actually happened?\u201dLiu Zhijing nudged Tao Yueying gingerly, bringing her back to her senses instantly.\u201cTeacher, my bracelet went missing! It must have been stolen!\u201dStolen?!The look on the teacher\u2019s face turned even more awful.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She\u2019s the one who bumped into me, not the other way round!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re lying! It was you!\u201dShe originally had no intention of making such a big fuss out of it, but Xia Xibei\u2019s reaction had utterly displeased Tao Yueying, and she felt very frustrated about it.Therefore, as soon as the discipline master appeared, she immediately fanned the flames further. Xia Xibei would have to take the blame anyway, so what would she be afraid of?\u201cHer friend told us that she\u2019s stolen lots of jewelry from the store before! My bracelet cost ten thousand! It\u2019s beautiful and expensive, how could she not be tempted!\u201dThe teacher\u2019s eyes went wide at her words. \u201cIs that true?\u201d\u201cOf course not! I did not steal!\u201dWith a furious look, Xia Xibei pointed at Tao Yueying as she said in a cold voice, \u201cWho said that I had stolen from the jewelry store? Step out!\u201dJin Yazhen shivered. She wanted to move out of the way, but she got jostled forward nonetheless.\u201cIt was you?\u201dXia Xibei grinded her teeth in rage. \u201cYou tried to slander me?!\u201dWith all eyes pinned on them, Jin Yazhen became rather timid. \u201cI-I wasn\u2019t trying to slander you! You-you did steal!\u201d\u201cBah!\u201d Xia Xibei went ballistic. \u201cWhen did I ever steal? It is you who has a thing for stealing, and you\u2019re trying to use me as a scapegoat? You\u2019re disgusting!\u201dScapegoat?The others were stunned for a moment. It would seem like there was more to the story!Jin Yazhen\u2019s face fell. \u201cI don\u2019t! You\u2019re slandering me!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s you who\u2019s slandering me!\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201dThe discipline master broke off their squabble in annoyance. \u201cStop bickering! Speak one by one!\u201dHis aura was so powerful that all the girls cowered, and no one dared to continue the quarrel.\u201cTalk first!\u201d The discipline master pointed at Xia Xibei.\u201cSir, I\u2019ve never done anything like that before! Besides, she\u2019s the one who likes to steal things, not me!\u201d Xia Xibei pointed at Jin Yazhen as she spoke, \u201cShe also used to make a lot of false claims against me before!\u201d\u201cI can testify on her behalf for that!\u201dTang Luo stood up from the side.The discipline master looked at Tang Luo with surprise.The form\u2019s top student\u2014how could he not know him?His attitude turned slightly better. \u201cTell me, what\u2019s going on here?\u201dSeeing the change in the discipline master\u2019s attitude, the girls couldn\u2019t help but exchange worried glances.Would the story\u2026take a turn from this point?Tang Luo ignored the reactions of the rest, looking only at the discipline master as he unhurriedly recounted the event. \u201cThis group of students rushed inside just now and claimed that my deskmate stole this girl\u2019s bracelet. They even wanted to search her bag. Meanwhile, this student named Jin Yazhen said that my deskmate used to steal things often. In my opinion, however, this is probably her revenge.\u201d\u201cI did not!\u201d Jin Yazhen\u2019s heart skipped a beat, her face turning pale as she quickly denied it.Tang Luo didn\u2019t pay attention to Jin Yazhen\u2019s denial. \u201cWhy do I feel like this is her revenge? Because she used to be good friends with Xia Xibei. In consideration of their friendship, Xia Xibei lent her and Yang Xuan quite a lot of money\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s nonsense!\u201d Jin Yazhen panicked, stepping forward and interrupting Tang Luo.It was Xia Xibei\u2019s problem to begin with, so how come she was implicated?The discipline master frowned. \u201cYang Xuan? Why does it sound so familiar?\u201d\u201cThe one whose parents came to the school last week and put on a huge drama,\u201d Xia Xibei reminded him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When he saw the bruises on her face that have yet to fade, he finally remembered.It couldn\u2019t be helped that the matter had developed into such a massive drama.How could he not have a deep impression when it was the very first time that such a thing had happened in their school?\u201cYes.\u201d Tang Luo nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s them. Classmate Jin and Yang Xuan are a couple, but classmate Jin tried to throw mud on my deskmate, saying that she and Yang Xuan were together. However, based on what we know, the real couple are actually classmate Jin and Yang Xuan!\u201dTang Luo\u2019s words left Jin Yazhen speechless and defenseless.They hadn\u2019t expected things to turn out this way when they started the drama in the first place!\u201cTang Luo, you\u2019re lying!\u201d She screamed in a tearful voice.\u201cShut up!\u201d The discipline master rebuked with an awful look on his face. \u201cIt\u2019s not your turn yet. Do not speak!\u201dThe teacher\u2019s face had looked so grave that Jin Yazhen didn\u2019t know how to begin even if she wanted to explain.Xia Qinghan and a few others exchanged glances, clueless about why Jin Yazhen had suddenly become the center of attention.But upon seeing the grim and dismal look on the discipline master\u2019s face, they remained silent.The discipline master was someone who would disregard even his kins all in the name of justice. If it were proven that Xia Xibei has committed theft, her punishment would be severe.However, if they were the ones found guilty, he wouldn\u2019t be any less dissatisfied either.Therefore, they had no choice but to keep their mouths shut at this point.\u201cThus, I believe that she was lying when she claimed that Xia Xibei steals often!\u201d Tang Luo remarked in a loud and clear voice, \u201cI\u2019ve been deskmates with Xia Xibei for a long time, and I know that she\u2019s a good student! Besides, she is also a hardworking learner, and she even got fifth place in the form for the monthly assessment this time!\u201dWhen the discipline master heard his statement, he became even more surprised. \u201cFifth place in the form?\u201dHe finally came to his senses.\u201cYou were the dark horse!\u201dThe assessment this time wasn\u2019t a difficult one, but it had not been\u2014in any way\u2014an easy one either.They remembered it well because Xia Xibei made it to the top five out of nowhere.He just didn\u2019t expect that she would be involved in such incidents.After hearing what Tang Luo had said about her, the discipline master developed a favorable impression of Xia Xibei.While results cannot solely determine the personality and moral character of a person, she nevertheless couldn\u2019t really be such an atrocious person if even Tang Luo trusted her that much.Having observed how the discipline master\u2019s attitude had changed, the faces of Liu Zhijing and the other two began to slightly change.\u201cSir, I can guarantee that I have never stolen anything before, and I do not have the slightest clue about where her bracelet is!\u201dXia Xibei looked sincere. \u201cI\u2019ve been studying in the classroom all the while, and I\u2019m planning to achieve better results in the next assessment. It\u2019s not like I have time to go about stealing things.\u201dHer words made the discipline master nod in approval.If every student were as fond of learning as she were, they wouldn\u2019t have had to worry so much, would they?Seeing that the discipline master was about to take Xia Xibei\u2019s side, Tao Yueying stepped forth right away.\u201cSir, that bracelet was given to me by my father, and it cost ten thousand yuandollars! We have searched the entire school, but we couldn\u2019t find it. Apart from Xia Xibei, I can\u2019t think of any other possibilities!\u201d\u201cSir, we\u2019re not really trying to put the blame on anyone for stealing. Perhaps someone has stumbled upon it on the floor but can\u2019t find the owner, so they brought it back.\u201d Xia Qinghan also chipped in, \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to get our heads around what really happened. We\u2019re all schoolmates, we also don\u2019t want this incident to turn ugly.\u201dXia Qinghan\u2019s words had eased the frown on the discipline master\u2019s brows. \u201cThat\u2019s not unlikely, too.\u201dHe believed that the students of their school weren\u2019t petty thieves.However, it concerned a bracelet that cost ten thousand, so the issue simply couldn\u2019t be brushed aside either.\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m suggesting we search through Xia Xibei\u2019s bag,\u201d Xia Qinghan raised her opinion.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Besides, I could see that you two get along often, doesn\u2019t this make her more suspicious? Why didn\u2019t you question her first?\u201dJin Yazhen stomped her feet upon being called out by Xia Xibei.\u201cWho stole anything! What proof do you have?!\u201d\u201cBack at where I used to work, she stole our superior\u2019s watch,\u201d Xia Xibei reminded her with an eerie smile on her face.\u201cHey!\u201dThe look on Jin Yazhen\u2019s face underwent a theatrical change.How did Xia Xibei know about that?!When she came back to her senses, she denied it immediately, \u201cWhat kind of nonsense are you talking about?!\u201dHowever, her reaction had given her away.If her accusation toward Xia Xibei had been a fabricated one, then Xia Xibei\u2019s accusation toward her wasn\u2019t just a laughing matter anymore.Even the discipline master noticed that something was off about Jin Yazhen.Xia Qinghan\u2019s heart missed a beat, and she panicked instantly. The situation didn\u2019t seem favorable to them now.\u201cSir, it\u2019s about time for recess. The problem has to come to an end anyhow, doesn\u2019t it? We don\u2019t wish to alert the cops either, it\u2019ll turn into a big deal if we do.\u201dShe seemed very sincere. \u201cWe promise that if we don\u2019t find anything, we\u2019ll apologize to Xia Xibei.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Tao Yueying nodded. \u201cSir, I don\u2019t want to go home without an explanation to my parents!\u201dThe discipline master had a deep frown on his face. The situation was getting a little troublesome to deal with.\u201cHow about this, Xia, we\u2019ll take a look at your bag, and if there\u2019s nothing wrong with it, I\u2019ll have them apologize to you.\u201d He looked toward Xia Xibei.Now that the discipline master had put it this way, Xia Xibei became slightly hesitant.Tang Luo voiced up.\u201cSir, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s appropriate.\u201dXia Qinghan and the other two couldn\u2019t help but scowl.Even Xia Xibei had begun to change her mind, what more was he trying to do? This was none of his business!\u201cIf they get to search another person\u2019s bag whenever they feel suspicious of anything, I\u2019m afraid that the rest would emulate it in the future, which will bring about a negative impact to the school.\u201dThe discipline master felt a terrible headache. \u201cWhat do you think should be done then? Do we call the cops for real?\u201dHe could have coerced Xia Xibei to agree upon it directly, but it would easily trigger the defiance of students.Tang Luo replied, \u201cHow about this, if you don\u2019t find anything, apologize to her in front of the entire school!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Xia Xibei nodded immediately, pointing at Xia Qinghan and the other two. \u201cAll three of you have to apologize!\u201dXia Qinghan and her mates went bug-eyed. How could she do that?\u201cWhat if we find it?\u201d Liu Zhijing gritted her teeth.\u201cDo whatever you have to, of course!\u201d Xia Xibei snorted. \u201cBut if you can\u2019t find it, you\u2019d better apologize to me in front of all the students! And you have to prove me innocent of stealing!\u201dAs she spoke, Xia Xibei cast a look at the door.Some other students had gathered to watch the fun.When the discipline master turned around, the students ran away immediately.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d The discipline master looked toward Xia Qinghan and the other two.\u201cFine! It\u2019s decided then!\u201dTao Yueying and Liu Zhijing nodded.Xia Qinghan was slightly hesitant nonetheless; she had a feeling that something wasn\u2019t right.However, Xia Xibei did not allow her to go back on her word. \u201cIf you don\u2019t agree, there\u2019s no way I would let you search my bag!\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201d Xia Qinghan finally nodded.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Check mine if you like!\u201dDeep inside, her resentment for Xia Xibei had escalated.She just couldn\u2019t figure out how Xia Xibei had turned into the person she was now.She had felt defeated so many times in front of Xia Xibei that she was on the verge of a meltdown.Nevermind; once the bracelet was found later, there was no way Xia Xibei could argue further!Once solid evidence was presented before their eyes, no one would believe in Xia Xibei\u2019s words anymore!When that time comes, all of them would regard Xia Xibei as a thief and a habitual liar. Who would still believe her?Having thought of that, Jin Yazhen\u2019s fury finally dissipated a little.\u201cAlright then, it\u2019s getting late, let\u2019s hurry up and start.\u201dAfter Jin Yazhen agreed to it, Xia Xibei acted fast and placed her bag up front without further ado.Jin Yazhen also took her bag and put it there.\u201cTo ensure fairness, let\u2019s have someone else do it,\u201d Tang Luo suggested.Liu Zhijing shot daggers at Tang Luo.She had no idea why Tang Luo was being so good to Xia Xibei.They couldn\u2019t be romantically involved, could they?No matter what the reason was, her thoughts did nothing to affect the bustle around her.The discipline master called on a girl who was watching the scene in the classroom to carry out the search.She started by looking inside Xia Xibei\u2019s bag.The girl opened the bag and rummaged out all the things inside it.Everyone stared straight at her, watching her movements with full attention.With all eyes focused on her, the girl\u2019s hands couldn\u2019t help but tremble a little, but she persevered through it, taking things out one by one.There wasn\u2019t a lot of stuff in Xia Xibei\u2019s bag, but there were several compartments inside the bag.After she had fished out all the things from a large compartment and found nothing unusual, the girl then unzipped the smaller compartment.There were some tissue papers and two bank cards tucked inside the smaller compartment.The girl took out all of those in a handful, but the next moment, the looks on all their faces changed.\u201cMy bracelet!\u201dTao Yueying pounced on it immediately, grasping the bracelet that was wedged between the two bank cards.Many of them heaved a silent sigh of relief the moment they saw the bracelet.Even Xia Qinghan felt as if the oppression in her was instantly relieved, and she beamed with a smug smile.\u201cMy bracelet really was with you!\u201dTao Yueying was so furious and agitated at the same time that her face became distorted.\u201cXia Xibei, what more do you have to say?\u201dLiu Zhijing stepped forth, biting her lip in an attempt to refrain the wild joy in her as she stared at Xia Xibei with a righteous, indignant look on her face.The looks on the others\u2019 faces changed as well.The bracelet really turned out to be in Xia Xibei\u2019s bag. So were the words that she just said only a pointless struggle before her appalling deed got exposed?It seemed more ridiculous now that they thought of it.Xia Xibei panicked a little with all the enraged looks pinned on her. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible!

If you didn\u2019t, then how did it end up inside your bag?\u201dAll the others shot disapproving looks at Xia Xibei as well.Just a while ago, Xia Xibei\u2019s persistent refusal had made many of them believe in her innocence.However, irrefutable evidence had been found now, which was a huge shame on her.\u201cSir!\u201dLiu Zhijing stood forth with pride. \u201cWe have found the proof now, haven\u2019t we? She did steal it after all!\u201d\u201cI did not steal!\u201d Xia Xibei exclaimed, \u201cThis isn\u2019t her bracelet, I bought it for myself!\u201dTao Yueying sneered. \u201cRight, your bracelet. This bracelet is worth ten thousand! Where did you get the money to buy it?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s right!\u201d Liu Zhijing chimed in, \u201cWho hasn\u2019t heard about your family\u2019s financial situation? You struggle to even feed yourself, how could you possibly afford a bracelet that costs over ten thousand?\u201dIf they weren\u2019t on such an occasion, they would have burst out in laughter already.They did not expect things to turn out so smoothly.Now that they came to think of it, Xia Xibei\u2019s refusal seemed like an advantage now.The more innocent she pretended to be a while ago, the more ashamed she would be right now!\u201cClassmate Xia, now that things have turned out like this, it\u2019s useless for you to keep denyingstay in denial.\u201d Xia Qinghan stood forth with a rueful look. \u201cIf only you had handed it over just now, we would have believed you were innocent, but now\u2026\u201dShe sighed, as though her heart was aching for Xia Xibei.The discipline master also stared at Xia Xibei with rage and disappointment in his eyes. Why did a pretty little girl like her have to get involved in such despicable acts?!Jin Yazhen heaved a sigh of relief at the side, overwhelmed with joy.What more could Xia Xibei say in her defense right now?The evidence had been found in broad daylight. How could she possibly absolve herself of the crime?\u201cI told you, she likes stealing little things from time to time and accusing people of things they didn\u2019t do!\u201dShe stepped forward and reproached Xia Xibei along with the rest. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame on the school for having students like you!\u201d\u201cStudent Xia, what more do you have to say?\u201dThe discipline master was extremely furious. There was no way he would tolerate such a loathsome offense!\u201cI do have something to say!\u201d Xia Xibei finally held her head up, wearing a subtle expression.\u201cWhat more do you wish to say!\u201dTao Yueying snorted angrily. \u201cThe evidence is undeniable now, how else do you want to argue?\u201d\u201cEvidence? Undeniable?\u201d Xia Xibei shot a glance at the bracelet. \u201cAre you certain that this is your bracelet?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d Tao Yueying nodded solemnly. \u201cYou stole my bracelet when you bumped into me the last time!\u201d\u201cI did?\u201d Xia Xibei laughed all of a sudden. \u201cYour bracelet cost over ten thousand?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Tao Yueying was puzzled at the way Xia Xibei was laughing, but still she nodded righteously. \u201cThe amount is big enough to send you to jail!\u201d\u201cRight! Call the cops and have them lock her up! Otherwise, who knows whose things would be stolen next!\u201d Liu Zhijing yelled along.Xia Qinghan spoke gently, \u201cDon\u2019t get all worked up. We are all schoolmates, she must have been confused for a moment. As long as she apologizes sincerely, she can still be forgiven.\u201d\u201cQinghan, you can\u2019t be so kind-hearted!\u201d Liu Zhijing was exasperated. \u201cShe deserves no sympathy from us!\u201dSeeing them echoing each other in harmony, Xia Xibei couldn\u2019t help but chuckle as she said these words\u2014watched them singing in harmony. She spoke.\u201cBut this bracelet is a ten-yuanten-dollar purchase from a roadside stall.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94: Ten-Yuan Roadside Stall ItemA ten-yuan roadside stall item.As soon as Xia Xibei said these words, there was instant silence.Everyone was a little lost. What did this mean?Tao Yueying and the others felt their hearts skipping a beat and immediately looked at the chain in her hand.\u201cWhat\u2026what did you say?!\u201d Tao Yueying\u2019s expression changed.After hearing what Xia Xibei said, she realized that the weight of the bracelet seemed a bit off.\u201cI bought this from a street stall for ten yuan!\u201dXia Xibei repeated her statement word for word, her expression calm.But other people felt as if they were hallucinating.Bought it for ten yuan?\u201cYou, you\u2019re saying nonsense!\u201d Tao Yueying finally regained her senses and stomped her feet. \u201cThis is obviously my bracelet!\u201d\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Xia Xibei smiled, then she stepped forward in large strides and took the chain from her hand.The bracelet had already been taken away before Tao Yueying could even react.When she came to, she saw a scene that shocked her.Xia Xibei had actually pulled the bracelet apart!\u201cNo!\u201dThe others turned pale with fright, shouting one after another.This was a bracelet worth more than ten thousand yuan! Was she crazy?!The next moment left everyone entirely stunned.As if she was tearing paper, Xia Xibei took the small pendant from the chain and split it in half.The exquisite and beautiful little star was broken into halves from the middle; it was white on the outside and yellow on the inside. The yellow filling was a bit dull, so people knew at a glance that this was definitely not gold nor silver but a worthless copper or iron!Xia Xibei also took out a piece of tissue and rubbed it hard on the chain.Everyone could clearly see that the white color on the bracelet had turned yellow.All of them silently watched Xia Xibei\u2019s motions, speechless.\u201cHow about it? Can you see it clearly?\u201dAfter Xia Xibei broke apart the bracelet completely, she looked at everyone. \u201cAre you sure that this bracelet was bought for more than ten thousand yuan?\u201dIf a bracelet of more than ten thousand yuan was of this quality, customer complaints would have inundated the jewelry company, right?!Tao Yueying and the other two girls watched the scene with cold hands and feet, their minds blank.How was this possible?!But this bracelet should obviously be hers!Xia Xibei looked at the director. \u201cSirDirector, do you think this bracelet is worth ten thousand yuan?\u201d\u201cNo way. This is merely a simple iron chain.\u201d The discipline masterdirector shook his head.Even if he hadn\u2019t worn these before, he had bought jewelry for his wife and daughter at home. He knew the difference between gold, silver, copper, and/or iron.Someone couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cThis can\u2019t be a genuine bracelet. The genuine bracelet pendant has He Xuanyu\u2019s signature!\u201dEveryone wanted this bracelet, not for the star\u2019s signature but because the. The signature added a lot of value to the bracelet.The one in Xia Xibei\u2019s hand was definitely a low-quality knock-off from the street!But this was not surprising; after all, the real thing was not something that not everyone could afford to buy.Therefore, knock-off products had always been around in the country of Hua, and its main consumer group was students with little money.After getting the acknowledgement of the other people, Xia Xibei smiled. \u201cSo, did I steal this bracelet?\u201dEveryone immediately shook their heads and said in unison, \u201cNo!\u201dXia Xibei\u2019s gaze swept across the group of three people including Xia Qinghan. \u201cSo, shouldn\u2019t you keep your word from a while ago?\u201d\u201cImpossible!\u201d Tao Yueying could only think of one strategy in her panic. She shouted, \u201cYour school bag has not been searched yet! My bracelet must be in it!\u201dSeeing her persistence, Xia Xibei raised her eyebrows. \u201cFine, let\u2019s continue!\u201dLooking into Xia Xibei\u2019s eyes, Tao Yueying\u2019s group couldn\u2019t help shaking.They had discovered that something was wrong!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95: Keep on LookingThe final result was, of course, not surprising.After Xia Xibei\u2019s school bag had been turned inside out, Tao Yueying\u2019s bracelet was still nowhere to be found.The expressions on Tao Yueying\u2019s group became grim.\u201cSo? Do you want to keep going?\u201d Xia Xibei patted her school bag. \u201cOr, shall we cut it open with scissors. Maybe there is something in the lining?\u201dThis ironic remark caused the faces of the three girls to turn even uglier.However, they had nothing to say.\u201cSo, can my name be cleared now?\u201d Xia Xibei looked around.\u201cOf course!\u201d Tang Luo nodded.The others dared not to speak; only Tang Luo was as calm as before.\u201cSince there is no evidence, you are obviously innocent.\u201d\u201cThen, do we continue our previous agreement?\u201d Xia Xibei looked at the three of them with a smile.\u201cOf course, we must continue!\u201d Tang Luo agreed. \u201cThe director will not let this matter just pass, right? If I had wronged people, I would apologize!\u201dThe discipline masterdirector looked a bit conflicted.Xia Xibei did not steal, which was, of course, a good thing.\u201cWe\u2019ll have to do whatever we said before.\u201dThe discipline masterdirector looked at the three of them, including Xia Qinghan. \u201cSince I can\u2019t find the bracelet, it means that this matter has nothing to do with classmate Xia. Therefore, the three of you have to apologize to her.\u201d\u201cApologize in front of the whole school!\u201d Xia Xibei added.\u201cYes.\u201d The discipline masterdirector nodded. \u201cTomorrow morning, you will have your apology and read it in front of the entire school.\u201dAs soon as these words came out, the faces of the three girls, including Xia Qinghan, turned pale.\u201cSirDirector!\u201d\u201cWhy? You\u2019re not admitting it?\u201d Xia Xibei said with a smile. \u201cWhen you thought I was a thief, you wanted to kick me out of the school! Now I\u2019m just asking you to apologize, so why can\u2019t you?\u201dAfter being reminded by Xia Xibei, everyone thought about what had just happened.The three of them had been very excited just now, wanting to drive Xia Xibei out of school.No one thought that a reversal would come so quickly.\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026.\u201dXia Qinghan bit her lips so hard they turned white. This was too mortifying!Would she still have a face if she apologized in front of the whole school? She was the school beauty! After this incident, she would become a laughing stock!However, no matter how unwilling she was, she had to accept reality.\u201cFine!\u201d She gritted her teeth and nodded.\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Xia Xibei then looked at Liu Zhijing and Tao Yueying.Liu Zhijing looked astonished and in disbelief.She still didn\u2019t want to believe this!They had obviously planned everything properly, so how did it end up like this?!\u201cXia Qinghan has already agreed, are you not willing?\u201d Xia Xibei urged.\u201cI\u2026 Fine!\u201dThe two ground their teeth and nodded humiliatingly, their hearts boiling over with hatred.\u201cGreat.\u201dSeeing their agreement, the director nodded in satisfaction. \u201cSince the matter has been resolved\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, sirdirector.\u201d Xia Xibei interrupted him. \u201cIt\u2019s still not over.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not?\u201d\u201cThe bracelet is still missing!\u201d Xia Xibei looked serious. \u201cAnd Jin Yazhen\u2019s school bag has not been searched yet! We were talking about it just now!\u201dWhen the flames of war spread to herself, Jin Yazhen\u2019s face paled. \u201cYou\u2014!\u201d\u201cWhat \u2018you\u2019?\u201d Xia Xibei shot her a quick look. \u201cWe had talked about this earlier. Is it possible that you\u2019re backing out of your promise?\u201dBefore Jin Yazhen could speak, she continued, \u201cEven if you regret it, it\u2019s pointless. I need to prove my innocence!\u201dAfter that, she told the girl searching the school bags, \u201cHer school bag is nextIt\u2019s her turn.\u201dThe girl looked around, a little embarrassed.The discipline master finallyFinally, the director nodded and said, \u201cGo on.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96: Xia Xibei\u2019s AngerAt first, Jin Yazhen was confident that the bracelet would be found in Xia Xibei\u2019s bag.However, the course of events that followed stunned her.Where was the bracelet?!She couldn\u2019t help but panic.If the bracelet was not in Xia Xibei\u2019s bag, then where could it be?!Although she knew that it couldn\u2019t possibly be in her bag, while watching the girl search her bag, her hands and feet started to turn cold.When the girl pulled out a silver-white bracelet with a surprised expression, her heart stopped beating for a few seconds, her entire body now stiff and unable to move.How could it be?!Why was the bracelet in her bag?!But no matter how surprised she was, she couldn\u2019t alter reality.\u201cThis is your bracelet, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Xia Xibei asked Tao Yueying.Before Tao Yueying could speak, the discipline master took the bracelet.\u201cWell, this is a real platinum bracelet with some small diamonds on it.\u201dThe discipline master swiftly verified the authenticity of this bracelet.Tao Yueying and Jin Yazhen reacted in the same way, both of them dumbstruck.How could the bracelet be in Jin Yazhen\u2019s bag?!\u201cI didn\u2019t steal it! You framed me!\u201d Jin Yazhen finally reacted, pointing at Xia Xibei with a mournful expression on her face, shouting, \u201cIt was you who framed me! It was you!\u201dFacing her accusation, Xia Xibei\u2019s expression became stern as she exclaimed, \u201cEnough!\u201dXia Xibei\u2019s face was gloomy, as if a furious storm would arrive the very next second.\u201cDo you think I\u2019m so easy to bully?\u201d She took a big step forward and approached Jin Yazhen in an instant, her movements intimidating. \u201cEvery time you steal something, you come to slander me and say that I stole it. Let\u2019s forget about the events that happened earlier. I\u2019ll endure them and won\u2019t try to get even with you. But you\u2019re still slandering me even now!\u201dBoom!A loud noise could be heard, causing everyone\u2019s hearts to beat wildly.Turning to the source of the sound, they all gasped.Xia Xibei had kicked a table down to the ground, and all the books that had been stacked on top of the table were now scattered all over the floor.What kind of force was this?!\u201cXia!\u201dThe discipline master\u2019s expression changed.Xia Xibei flushed. She took several deep breaths, her chest heaving as if trying to restrain her anger.She pointed at Jin Yazhen and spoke coldly, \u201cJin Yazhen, listen clearly. Don\u2019t force me, otherwise I won\u2019t be blamed for being rude! Next time, this kick will befall you, not the table!\u201dAfter she finished speaking, she turned around to face everyone.\u201cSorry, I couldn\u2019t hold it in.\u201dThe others shook their heads quickly in response. They felt that she had been pretty good at holding it in.If it were them who had slandered repeatedly, and now accused even when the evidence was revealed, they wouldn\u2019t be able to hold back their desire to get revenge on Jin Yazhen!Xia Xibei was already restrained and patient enough. If it were them, they would already have slapped Jin Yazhen\u2019s face!\u201cTeacher, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m too agitated,\u201d Xia Xibei said to the discipline master.\u201cIt\u2019s alright, I understand.\u201d The teaching master could only comfort her, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will take care of this matter.\u201dSeeing the anger on Xia Xibei\u2019s face, the teaching master also felt a little sympathy towards her.Anyone who had to go through this would be furious!Xia Xibei had already behaved well by not beating her up.Thinking of this, he looked at Jin Yazhen, who hadn\u2019t regained herself yet. \u201cGo to the office! Give me a clear explanation!\u201dHe appeared stern and infuriated.\u201cSuch a rebel! How dare you do such a thing?! I have to call your parents now! I won\u2019t accommodate this misdeed!\u201dStealing things and slandering others, this student had gone too far!When Jin Yazhen heard that he was going to call her parents, her face turned ghastly pale.\u201cI didn\u2019t do it, they forced me!\u201d Her hand immediately pointed to Tao Yueying\u2019s trio.\u201cWhat?!\u201dEveryone present was once again stunned.Was there a story behind this?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97: The Result Had Been DeterminedJin Yazhen\u2019s words stunned everyone.Was this drama also related to Xia Qinghan\u2019s trio?Xia Qinghan\u2019s trio were also dumbstruck by Jin Yazhen\u2019s sudden explosion.Why was this idiot exposing the matter?But no matter what Jin Yazhen claimed, they would never admit to it.\u201cYou are talking nonsense!\u201d Liu Zhijing reacted quickly. She stepped forward immediately, fury all over her face. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who did wrong, how dare you slander us!\u201dTao Yueying added, \u201cYes! How is it related to us? You\u2019re the one who stole my bracelet!\u201dXia Qinghan appeared helpless and distressed. \u201cJin, are you trying to drag us through the mire?\u201dThe reaction of the trio made the onlookers waver.Who was telling the truth?Xia Xibei smiled scornfully. \u201cDiscipline master, it seemed that things are not as simple as they appear!\u201dThe discipline master\u2019s expression had turned completely dark.He never expected that things would progress like this.\u201cAll of you, come with me!\u201dHe was extremely indignant.\u201cTeacher!\u201d Xia Qinghan\u2019s trio said in unison, \u201cWe are being wronged!\u201d\u201cWhether they are wronged or not depends on the evidence,\u201d Xia Xibei slowly said. \u201cTeacher, I think this matter should be investigated carefully. If they were really slandered, then the slanderer has to be punished; but if it is true\u2026 \u201dThe disciple master nodded and stated coldly, \u201cI know what to do.\u201dXia Xibei shrugged.\u201cTeacher, I\u2019ll have to leave this to you. I still have other things to handle, so I have to go back first.\u201dXia Qinghan was stunned for a moment. She hadn\u2019t expected that Xia Xibei wouldn\u2019t use her advantage.She thought that Xia Xibei would definitely refuse to let her go!Meeting her confused eyes, Xia Xibei smiled brightly.Xia Qinghan turned away immediately, as if scalded by scorching flames.Seeing her guilty look, Xia Xibei smiled once again.Of course, she knew what Xia Qinghan must be thinking.It\u2019s just that she had already foreseen the final result.Since they dared to involve Jin Yazhen in this matter, they must have ensured that there wouldn\u2019t be any evidence left behind.So, even if Jin Yazhen wanted to expose their evildoing, it would be useless.They weren\u2019t fools who didn\u2019t know how to defend themselves.When that time arrived, it would be another round of never-ending quarreling.Even after the quarrel, the result would remain unchanged.No matter what happened, the final result would be that another wrongdoing would be added to Jin Yazhen\u2019s crime, but nothing would happen to Xia Qinghan\u2019s trio.But Xia Xibei did not care about what happened to them.After all, whether or not they were convicted, they couldn\u2019t erase this matter.Since the enmity between them had already been established, why waste any more time on them?After this, the discipline master took those people to the office, and the rest of the students dispersed.While Xia Xibei was packing her bag, she said to Tang Luo, \u201cShould I give you a new bracelet?\u201d\u201cNo need,\u201d Tang Luo shook his head, \u201cIt\u2019s just a worthless object, no need to give me back.\u201d\u201cThank you, then. Next time, I\u2019ll treat you to milk tea!\u201dXia Xibei did not insist but nodded readily.If Xia Qinghan heard their conversation, she would be furious!Unbeknownst to her, Tang Luo happened to discover that Jin Yazhen had put the bracelet in Xia Xibei\u2019s bag.Tang Luo had informed Xia Xibei of this matter.Originally, Xia Xibei only intended to place the bracelet in Jin Yazhen\u2019s bag, but Tang Luo happened to also have a knockoff bracelet with him.After adding this bracelet into the drama, the effect was even better.After setting those girls into the trap, Xia Xibei was in a very good mood.On the way home with Song Jiaren, she suddenly stopped and said that she wanted to head to the shopping mall.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98: Prize DrawIt was a large-scale shopping mall that had just opened, and its door was decorated with many banners and posters celebrating its opening.On one of the posters, several prominent words were written \u2013\u201dPurchase over 100 yuan for a chance at the prize draw!\u201dAt the prize draw corner by the door, numerous prizes were displayed.There were all kinds of home appliances, but the most attractive prize among them all was a brand-new car.In this day and age, when new stores open, they would use various methods and models to attract customers.Since this mall was very large and new, there were already a lot of customers. Coupled with the attraction by such prizes, more and more people gathered.The Grand Prize was this car, and many people had come for it.But, how could it be so easy to draw a car that was worth more than 200,000 yuan?Many gifts placed around the car were given away, but the car remained there, and its presence continued to attract more customers.Within the big transparent prize draw box, there were numerous white balls.Opening these white balls would reveal the result of the draw.Whenever someone was drawing the prize, many people would stare at the person while holding their breaths, as if they were the one drawing the lot.And when the prize drawn was announced, everyone would become even more nervous. They were expecting a big prize to be drawn, yet they were also afraid that a big prize would be taken away by others.Wave after wave of people came with hope, only to leave in disappointment.\u201cWhat are you going to buy?\u201d Song Jiaren asked.\u201cI\u2019m just buying something to enter the prize draw,\u201d Xia Xibei explained casually, continuing to walk forward.\u201cPrize draw?\u201d Song Jiaren became even more puzzled. Why had Xia Xibei suddenly become interested in the prize draw?However, she didn\u2019t ask too many questions, following Xia Xibei into the mall instead.Indeed, there were lots of things in this mall, covering a whole range of categories.Song Jiaren was pushing a cart while following behind Xia Xibei, watching her throw one item after another into the cart.\u201cI also have these things at home, I will bring them to you next time,\u201d Song Jiaren said.\u201cIt\u2019s alright, I need to use them anyway,\u201d Xia Xibei replied casually. Soon, she gathered everything she wanted and headed to the checkout.There were many people queuing at the checkout counters, waiting for nearly half an hour before it was their turn.The items that Xia Xibei bought amounted to over 100 yuan, and with her receipt, she could participate in the prize draw.Song Jiaren followed Xia Xibe to the prize draw corner.The prize-drawing process was a little slow, so by the time it was Xia Xibei\u2019s turn, another half an hour had already passed.Among the people queuing before them, the biggest prize that had been drawn was a TV.Although it was not the car, it was also a huge surprise.Watching the staff move the TV out, everyone was envious.Xia Xibei did not care about others; business. After handing her receipt to the staff, she directly put her hand into the prize draw box.Everyone could see that she fiddled around in the box for a while before taking a ball out.\u201cOpen it up! There must be a big prize in it!\u201d Song Jiaren leaned over excitedly.In her entire life, she had never won a single prize before, even if it was the most common one, such as \u201cone more bottle.\u201dTherefore, she was very envious of lucky people.Xia Xibei smiled, \u201cHow do you know that there is a big prize in it?\u201d\u201cYou are definitely able to win the jackpot!\u201dSong Jiaren appeared extremely confident.Xia Xibei laughed, \u201cThen let\u2019s win the big prize.\u201dAfter she finished speaking, she used a little bit of force to open the white ball.Within it was a folded piece of paper.She unfolded the paper.After reading the words written on top, Song Jiaren was dumbstruck for a moment, then her pupils shrank and she suddenly gasped.She exclaimed, her voice cracking because she was too excited, \u201cGrand Prize \u2013 Car?!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99: The Grand PrizeAfter she said the word \u2018car,\u2019 it seemed as if a mute button had been pressed.Two seconds later, the scene came back to life.\u201cCar?!\u201d\u201cHave I heard that right?! Grand prize?!\u201d\u201cNo way?!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m still waiting to draw the prize! Is the car really won already?\u201dThe voices from the crowd of onlookers grew louder, their restless emotions starting to spread.The staff immediately leaned towards them, saying, \u201cI need to have a look at it first.\u201dAfter reading the words clearly, the staff member was also shocked.It really was the grand prize! What kind of luck was this!After the onlookers exclaimed in shock, they started to gather towards them. \u201cLet me see! Let me see!\u201dAfter seeing the words clearly, everyone\u2019s expressions turned very complicated.Excitement, envy, disappointment\u2026 These emotions were mixed together, turning everyone almost mad.That was the grand prize!\u201cYou\u2019re so lucky, girl! It is really the grand prize!\u201d\u201cOh no, my car! I\u2019m still waiting for my turn to draw!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so envious!\u201d\u201cGirl, your luck is exceptional!\u201d\u201cGirl, do you have a driver\u2019s license? Are you still a student? You\u2019re so lucky!\u201dSuch good luck\u2026That was what everyone was thinking.Everyone was extremely envious. Who wouldn\u2019t want to win the jackpot?But the lucky ones amongst them would, at most, win things like an electric kettle. That was nothing compared to a car!\u201cBeibei, you won the grand prize!\u201dSong Jiaren came back to her senses after the initial shock, immediately embracing Xia Xibei and bouncing with joy.\u201cYou\u2019re so lucky! That\u2019s a car!\u201dOf course, Song Jiaren\u2019s family had a car at home, but it was entirely different when the car was won through a prize draw!Seeing Xia Xibei win the prize, Song Jiaren was very excited, almost as if she was the one winning it.\u201cQuick! We want to redeem the prize!\u201dAfter the excitement, Song Jiaren immediately turned to the staff and asked them to redeem the prize.\u201cPlease wait!\u201d After the staff regained his senses, he immediately jumped to action, \u201cI have to report to the manager first!\u201dAfter he finished speaking, he ran away.The people around them were still very excited.Although they were not the ones who had won the prize, the prize was still drawn right before their eyes, and the meaning was very different.\u201cIt\u2019s great! it\u2019s so great!\u201d Song Jiaren was still very excited, bouncing around. \u201cIf I had luck like yours, that would be great!\u201dIn response, Xia Xibei smiled without saying a single word.After a while, the staff hurried over with a middle-aged man.The man was out of breath from running, and before he could even catch his breath, he snatched the piece of paper right out of Xia Xibei\u2019s hand.He was very agitated, using a great deal of force.If Xia Xibei had not let go of the paper fast enough, the paper might have been torn apart.After reading the words written on top, his breath stopped for a second. \u201cDid\u2026 Did you really draw this?\u201dWhen these words came out, Song Jiaren became a little angry.\u201cWhat do you mean by that? If we didn\u2019t draw this, could we have faked it? With so many people here, how could we have done that?!\u201dThe onlookers around them also gave their support.\u201cWe\u2019ve all witnessed it!\u201d\u201cThis little girl has drawn the prize!\u201d\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t count, then will I be able to draw it?\u201d\u201cIn your dreams!\u201dThe heckling by everyone around them made the man\u2019s face turn a little pale, cold sweat dripping down from his forehead.The corners of his mouth twitched and quickly explained, \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean that. I was just so surprised. My name is Tao.\u201dXia Xibei smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, you just need to verify it.\u201dManager Tao\u2019s complexion turned blue, his smile a little bitter. After careful inspection, he nodded unwillingly, \u201cIt is indeed the grand prize.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100: Sell The Car To You\u201cIt\u2019s really the grand prize, isn\u2019t it?Song Jiaren appeared even more pleased than Xia Xibei. \u201cSince it is real, then hurry up and help us redeem the prize! We still have other things to do after this!\u201dManager Tao looked at Xia Xibei who was smiling, and the bitterness in his heart became even more overwhelming.He really didn\u2019t expect that someone would draw this car so soon, this is just terrible!Thinking of the series of consequences that may follow, he almost fell into tears.But he dared not do anything in front of everyone.\u201cOkay, I will hand you the car now.\u201d He lifted the corners of his mouth into a stiff smile.However, because Xia Xibei was still underage and didn\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license, even if she took the car, she wouldn\u2019t be able to drive it.Therefore, she asked, \u201cCan you convert it to money?\u201d\u201cMoney?\u201d Manager Tao\u2019s complexion paled. \u201cHow do you want to convert to money?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that easy?\u201d Song Jiaren said, \u201cJust give us the amount that this car is worth!\u201d\u201cEmm\u2026\u201d Manager Tao\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cOur company does not have this policy.\u201d\u201cFine then.\u201dXia Xibei did not insist and instead asked, \u201cWhat is the market value of this car?\u201dManager Tao replied, \u201cTwo hundred and fifty thousand yuan.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dXia Xibei turned around and spoke directly to the onlookers around her, \u201cDoes anyone want this car? I\u2019ll sell it to you! The market value of this car is two hundred and fifty thousand, and I\u2019m offering only two hundred and twenty thousand.\u201dTwo hundred twenty thousand?Everyone couldn\u2019t help but gasp, this was thirty thousand less!Even twenty thousand was not a small number anymore.If they were to go to a car dealer to buy a car, no one would offer such discount.Some of them were moved, but they didn\u2019t make a decision right away.After all, they would have to take out two hundred and twenty thousand at once, which was not a small amount.\u201cMiss\u2026 This is against our policy\u2026\u201d Manager Tao came to stop her.\u201cThis is not against the policy!\u201d Xia Xibei shrugged. \u201cYour company has no regulations saying that the prizes cannot be transferred. Besides, this car already belongs to me, I have the right to deal with it!\u201dManager Tao\u2019s face twitched. \u201cThat\u2019s true\u2026\u201d\u201cThen it\u2019s fine!\u201d Xia Xibei interrupted him, \u201cI can\u2019t use it anyway, so of course I have to sell it! Or I can also sell it to you?\u201dManager Tao was stunned for a moment, \u201cStop joking with me\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not joking with you.\u201dXia Xibei shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m serious. Since I can\u2019t use the car, it\u2019s useless for me to keep it. I\u2019ll give it to anyone who can afford it.\u201dManager Tao couldn\u2019t help but become silent.\u201cWho wants to buy it?\u201d Xia Xibei turned around and shouted to the crowd, \u201cTwo hundred twenty thousand, and the car is yours!\u201d\u201cWait!\u201dManager Tao shouted immediately, and then pulled Xia Xibei to the side.\u201cHow about this, I don\u2019t have that much money with me, can you\u2026 can you lower the price?\u201dSong Jiaren looked at Manager Tao questioningly, he really wants to buy it?\u201cManager Tao, as you know, this is a new car! I have already offered 30,000 yuan less! This is already a huge discount!\u201d Xia Xibei was serious, \u201cIf I have a driver\u2019s license, I would not sell it!\u201dManager Tao smiled bitterly. \u201cOf course I know you have made a huge discount, but I really don\u2019t have that much money with me! It\u2019s also not easy for anyone to take out such a huge sum at once! See? Who among the onlookers can take out so much money? Just lower the price a little!\u201dXia Xibei thought for a moment, and finally nodded. \u201cWell then, two hundred ten thousand! Can\u2019t be any less!\u201dManager Tao still wanted to continue bargaining, but seeing Xia Xibei\u2019s reaction, he could only grit his teeth in the end. \u201cOkay! Two hundred and ten thousand, deal!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
