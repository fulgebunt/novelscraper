There will not be a set schedule for releases as I generally just go to this novel when I want to laugh lmao. I do consider this as one of my potential projects though, but I'm not sure yet cause I'm not even halfway through the novel. It's free for pick-up by any translator who's interested~\u2014Translated by: ZryuuEdited by: Playerprophet\u2014In March, Yu Zhengdu reported to a small startup in the Science Park of Fu City's Development Zone.\"Welcome to Luofeng Life Management Consulting Co. Ltd.\" A tall and beautiful HR manager, Lu Lingxi, grinned as she clapped. She looked like she just managed to breathe a huge sigh of relief. \"We've been trying to recruit a developer for a long time, and now we've finally got one.\"Yu Zhengdu paused, then asked, \"Was it difficult for you to recruit someone for this position?\"Wasn't it just an ordinary software engineer position? Although the company doesn't look all that reliable, it shouldn't be so bad to the extent that they couldn't even recruit a developer ba?\"The main reason is that our boss is a little demanding.\" Lu Lingxi's mouth twitched, \"We did interview a few who were suitable, but they were all a bit bald.\"Yu Zhengdu, \"\u2026\u2026\"That is a little demanding. It's not easy to find a skillful engineer who isn't bald these days.But he never would have expected that the reason he was chosen was because of his thick locks of hair.He subconsciously touched his lush and fluffy head, and doubted the company's professional standards.Yu Zhengdu was in his fourth year of college. He had already gotten an employment notice from a famous technological factory \u2014 Nova S&amp;T, and was prepared to start his interns.h.i.+p after the Spring Festival, then formally switch to a full-time post after his graduation. But something unexpected cropped up after the Spring Festival, so his offer fell through.He wasn't really anxious about that, though. In fact, besides Nova S&amp;T, several other reputable companies had extended olive branches at him as well. He didn't take those, and instead searched a recruitment website and ended up applying for a position at a small and inconspicuous company.Said small company, Luofeng Life Management Consulting, wrote a high-end and impressive introduction on the recruitment website, and claimed to handle affairs related to life planning and management. Yu Zhengdu wasn't sure what 'life planning' was supposed to plan, but according to the office size that he had observed, there couldn't be more than 20 employees, and the office environment seemed relatively simple too. Its financial ac.u.men was not as solid as they had proclaimed in their company's introduction.Yu Zhengdu had a stable psyche and didn't forget to ask, \"By the way, what about my labour contract?\"Lu Lingxi paused. \"You're not going to wait until you get accustomed to the environment before signing it?\"Yu Zhengdu looked at her silently, and slowly said, \"if I don't sign the contract, will the company give me social security?\"Lu Lingxi smacked her head. \"I almost forgot that you need social security!\"Yu Zhengdu, \"\u2026\u2026\"Was this the conventional modus operandi of the legendary pheasant company? (an unregistered business operated illegally)But no matter what, he still signed the labour contract, and Lu Lingxi did guarantee him with much sincerity that he would be given social security.After completing the onboarding formalities, Lu Lingxi took him around the various departments to meet his new colleagues. Yu Zhengdu took a headcount \u2014 there were a total of 15 people in the company, including him. It was compatible with the size of the office, so it didn't surprise him in the slightest.Not only that, he was also the only employee in the company's technology department.Yu Zhengdu was shocked, \"What? I'm the only one in the technology department?\"Lu Lingxi shrugged and said, slightly embarra.s.sed, \"Can't help it, we can only afford to hire one living person right now.\"Yu Zhengdu was still immersed in the shock of actually being the only developer in the company, and didn't notice the statement of 'living person' for a while.Just then, the door to a lone office nearby opened. A man walked out and asked, \"Lingxi, has the new technology department employee arrived?\"Lu Lingxi said, \"He's here, I was about to take him to see you.\"After she spoke, she turned around and introduced him to Yu Zhengdu, \"Xiao Yu, this is our boss, Shang Que.\"Yu Zhengdu looked up, and he got a huge shock.He was a very good-looking young man; his facial features were so beautiful that they practically transcended the boundaries of gender. Even in the age where technology was so advanced and you could see all sorts of beautiful people on the internet, his appearance was still enough to make the eyes of anyone who saw him light up.Yu Zhengdu said subconsciously, \"h.e.l.lo boss.\"\"Un, h.e.l.lo.\" While Shang Que nodded, he scrutinised Yu Zhengdu's hairline and said, with much satisfaction, \"Not bad, he has a lot of hair.\"Yu Zhengdu returned the compliment, \"Boss has quite a lot of hair too.\"Shang Que, \"\u2026\u2026\"Lu Lingxi, \"\u2026\u2026\"Shang Que was in a daze for a moment before he remembered something and beckoned Yu Zhengdu. \"Come to my office for a chat ba.\"Lu Lingxi nudged Yu Zhengdu. \"Go on, our technical team is a little simple and crude, the boss wants to personally check for himself.\"Yu Zhengdu glanced askance at Lu Lingxi and thought, your technical team shouldn't even try to rig a scam with the words 'simple and crude', the team doesn't even exist at all, okay?!Lu Lingxi seemed like she couldn't see his contemptuous gaze at all, then just turned around and walked away.Yu Zhengdu followed Shang Que into the office. The boss' office wasn't big, and it was decorated simply. There was just a huge bookcase against the wall on the left side \u2014 but there weren't a lot of books on it, and was instead filled up with bottles of various sizes.Yu Zhengdu glanced at it once \u2014 there were wine bottles, condiment bottles, milk bottles\u2026\u2026and there were even empty bottles of oral medication that have been drunk. You could say that it didn't seem impressive at all, and was incompatible with the kind of air that a beautiful, young boss should have. He didn't know why Shang Que would collect all those bottles.\"Un\u2026\u2026\" Shang Que looked at Yu Zhengdu, thought about it for a bit, then s.h.i.+fted his computer screen towards him, \"Why don't you repair a computer for me first?\"Yu Zhengdu, \"\u2026\u2026\"He said without any expression on his face, \"Boss, developers don't actually know how to repair computers.\"Shang Que revealed a doubtful look. \"They don't?\"Yu Zhengdu didn't hesitate. \"No.\"\"What a pity.\" Shang Que's tone was filled with regret. His beautiful eyes blinked, then he complained, \"I don't know why my computer lags all the time. I think the guy who sold me the computer tricked me.\"Yu Zhengdu's gaze followed Shang Que's gesture and fell upon his computer screen, then he paused, \"\u2026\u2026\"All he could see was how Shang Que's computer had several online games turned on at the same time, and it had lagged the interface to death.Yu Zhengdu stood still for a minute, then wordlessly restarted the computer.Shang Que, \"\u2026\u2026\"Shang Que pretended as if nothing had happened. He leaned gracefully against the back of his chair and folded his hands in front of him. \"Then, let's talk about your next job ba.\"Yu Zhengdu pulled out a chair and sat down. \"Please.\"Shang Que looked at him. \"So it's like this. In the past two years, our company's business volume has increased dramatically, and our colleagues often make mistakes. I hope you can develop a more advanced office system to improve employee efficiency and minimize their errors.\"Yu Zhengdu looked at his boss' handsome face and asked slowly, \"Will I be developing it by myself?\"\"Un.\" Shang Que nodded. He didn't seem to bother with putting on a 'boss' act and said frankly: \"We only have enough RMB in our account to hire one person.\"The idea of resigning suddenly emerged in Yu Zhengdu's mind. He pressed down on his chest and asked, \"Then what about the development budget?\"Shang Que asked doubtfully, \"What budget? Isn't a computer enough for the development?\"Yu Zhengdu, \"\u2026\u2026\"He's finished, the layman is trying to direct the professional.Yu Zhengdu: idea of resigning strengthens gradually.He held his forehead and said in earnest, \"I'm sorry Boss, I can't accept your request.\"\"Is it very difficult?\" Shang Que fixed his eyes on Yu Zhengdu. He had a very deep gaze, and no reflection could be seen in his black pupils, but they made it difficult for people to walk away from him.Yu Zhengdu was prepared to just up and leave, but because he was getting stared at like that, his heart softened a little. He sighed and began explaining the process of technological development to his boss.After listening to him carefully, Shang Que's expression turned grave. \"I didn't expect that it would cost so much to develop a system.\"Yu Zhengdu nodded, but he did feel fortunate. At least, Shang Que wasn't the kind of boss that would just talk to himself and completely ignore objective facts.Shang Que's index finger tapped lightly on his desk, revealing some annoyance on his face, \"Then that'll be troublesome. Our company's account doesn't have much RMB, it's only enough to pay rent and utility bills. It wasn't easy for us to save up enough money to hire you.\"Yu Zhengdu, \"\u2026\u2026\"The boss spoke so frankly that he couldn't help but worry about not being able to get his salary.Yu Zhengdu left Shang Que's office and returned to his workstation, then began to seriously consider the wording of his resignation letter.Although he had deliberately looked for a small and inconspicuous company to work at, this company's financial situation was too unreliable. He was very worried that he would be forced to embark on the road of 'demanding his salary' at such a young age.Yu Zhengdu was hesitating when he heard the telephone of the consultation department ring nearby.The phone's ringing was both crisp and clear, yet no one picked up.Yu Zhengdu looked up and realised that all his colleagues had somehow disappeared without his notice.Yu Zhengdu, \"\u2026\u2026???\"He looked at the time and saw that it was already time for the noon break, so he had no other choice but to walk over and pick up the phone. \"h.e.l.lo?\"An old man's voice travelled from the other end of the line. \"h.e.l.lo, is this Luofeng Life Management?\"\"Yes, what can I do for you?\"The other party's voice sounded a bit anxious. \"h.e.l.lo comrade, I received your company's text message in the morning to inform me of my reincarnation tomorrow. But the text said that I'll become a pig in my next life. Did you guys make a mistake somewhere? Why would I reincarnate into a pig?\"Yu Zhengdu, \"?????\"Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslated by: ZryuuEdited by: Playerprophet\u2014Yu Zhengu was stunned by the words spoken on the other end, and took a long time to snap out of his stupor. \"I'm sorry, I didn't hear you clearly. Could you repeat that for me?\"So the old man repeated himself, and solemnly emphasised, \"Comrade, I've never committed any outrageous acts before, and even if I can't become human, then I should at least be able to become a cow or a horse or the like? Why would I become a pig?\"Yu Zhengdu, \"\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu pondered for about half a minute, then replied in earnest, \"Sir, this is our office number. Please don't use it for a joke.\"After he finished speaking, he hung up and thought, is square dancing and egg sales not enough to satisfy the elderly these days? (In the People's Republic of China, square dancing or plaza dancing, is an exercise routine performed to music in squares, plazas or parks of the nation's cities. It is popular with middle-aged and retired women who have been referred to as \u201cdancing grannies\u201d in the English-language media.)While Yu Zhengdu sighed about how public morals were degenerating with each pa.s.sing day, he went downstairs for lunch.Lunch break ended, and his new colleagues silently reappeared in the office.Yu Zhengdu didn't take the prank call in the afternoon seriously. He searched for several resignation letter templates online and prepared to collate them to send to Lu Lingxi before leaving work.While he wrote his resignation letter, he browsed his WeChat messages. Something interesting should have happened, since his cla.s.s' WeChat group chat was active.Anti-baldness Alliance:Zhang Qingqing:\u3010Fellow cla.s.smates, I've gotten an offer from Ox Factory, in quality control\u3011Cla.s.smate A:\u3010Wow, congrats\u3011Cla.s.smate B:\u3010those who haven't found a job yet wail in anguish\u3011Cla.s.smate C:\u3010Wail in anguish +1, and also expressing envy of Qingqing\u3011Zhang Qingqing:\u3010What's there to be envious about? If you guys wanna envy someone it should be Zhengdu ba, he got the offer from Nova so early. That's the true cosmic factory\u3011Zhu Yan:\u3010_(:\u0437\u300d\u2220)_ truth. Also, Zhengdu is the only one from our major who got an offer from Nova this year\u3011Cla.s.smate A:\u3010I think so\u3011Hou Guangzong:\u3010Hehe, I don't think so? I got an offer from Nova too. I reported to work a few days ago, but I didn't see Zhengdu\u3011Cla.s.smate B:\u3010Wow, Guangzong got an offer from Nova too? That's so awesome\u3011Hou Guangzong:\u3010It's okay, I was just lucky\u3011Zhang Qingqing:\u3010Didn't hear you mention it at all before this, you've been a bit low profile oh~\u3011Zhu Yan:\u3010Eh, then what about Zhengdu? He obviously got it during the campus recruitment last year, I even saw his offer email\u3011Cla.s.smate A:\u3010@Yu Zhengdu, Summoning-no-jutsu, show yourself, Curve Wrecker!\u3011Yu Zhengdu looked up from the resignation letter he finished and saw that he had been @ dozens of times in the group chat. He quickly browsed through the conversation, and when he saw Hou Guangzong's \"Hehe, I don't think so? I got an offer from Nova too\", he just thought it was a little amusing. But he didn't bother giving them an explanation.Yu Zhengdu:\u3010Un, not going to the cosmic factory, changed to another company\u3011Cries of surprise resounded through the cla.s.s chat. All his cla.s.smates inquired about the reason, and there were some who asked him which company he was working at now.Yu Zhengdu ignored the first question, and was about to say that he was ready to resign from his new company when an old man with gray hair rushed into the office. His gaze swept across the room, then he stammered as he asked, \"Excuse me, is this Luofeng Management?\"This mini company didn't even have a front desk. Yu Zhengdu's seat was close to the entrance, so he leaned across his desk and answered, \"Yes, what can I do for you?\"\"I've finally found the place.\" The old man's eyes were practically br.i.m.m.i.n.g with excitement. He strode forward, took his phone out and shoved it up in Yu Zhengdu's face. \"Comrade, my name is Chen Kang, I received your text this morning\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu couldn't snap out of his stupor for a while. He subconsciously glanced at the old man's phone. All he could see was the enlarged font of a text message on the outdated phone.\u3010Dear customer, your reincarnation time has been arranged. Please wait in line at Fu City's Ancient Well Reincarnation Checkpoint on the morning of March 20, 2018 for your reincarnation. Your queue number is 1022. According to your acc.u.mulated merits and demerits throughout this life, you will reincarnate into a pig in a livestock farm. Please cherish the time you have left. If you have any enquiries, please dial the number: 000-x.x.xx.x.x. Luofeng Life Management Consulting Co., Ltd.\u3011Yu Zhengdu, \"\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu, \"?????\"He read the message in disbelief twice before reacting \u2014 the words spoken by the old man in his call actually wasn't a senseless joke.And what would this imply?This implies that Luofeng Life Management company, where he was employed at, was a fraudulent company! And it's the kind of despicable company that wouldn't even spare the elderly!And their swindling method was particularly crude. They actually deceived an old man into thinking that he would reincarnate into a pig?!Yu Zhengdu couldn't help but marvel that such scam techniques still existed. He pulled the old man toward the entrance while saying in a soft voice, \"Old sir, this is a scam text, you musn't believe it. Hurry and go home.\"But that old man wouldn't listen to him and said repeatedly, \"No no, I have to clarify this. I'm reincarnating tomorrow, this is no joke\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu felt a bit helpless. He has seen a lot of elderly like Chen Kang on the news. Due to their lack of judgment and fear of death, they often believe such cheaters without any doubt, and some even go so far as to obey them without question.And the person in front of him was a living example. Yu Zhengdu was about to drag Chen Kang outside to persuade him when someone from the consulting department discovered that something was happening. That person stood up and asked, \"What happened?\"Yu Zhengdu quickly guarded Chen Kang by standing in front of him, \"Nothing\u2026\u2026\"Before he finished speaking, he heard Chen Kang shout in a hurry. \"Comrade, there's something wrong with my reincarnation text\u2014\u2014\"Why can't I stop this guy no matter what? Yu Zhengdu sighed. Now he just had to fight face to face with the evil forces. He was prepared to righteously condemn his colleagues when he felt a chill surge through his body. His vision blurred, and in the next second, he saw that Chen Kang had ran in front of him in an instant. His figure even seemed a little translucent.Yu Zhengdu, \"\u2026\u2026??\"He was stunned for a moment before it dawned on him that Chen Kang had ran straight through his body.Yu Zhengdu stared at Chen Kang running towards the consulting department in a daze, \"Comrade, this is the text I received\u2014\u2014\"The colleague from the consulting department welcomed him warmly. \"Please show me your ID card.\"Chen Kang took out an ID card and handed it to him. The colleague verified it for him. \"Please hold on for a minute, I'll check your file.\"As he spoke, he moved the mouse and checked the information on his computer for awhile, then apologised to Chen Kang. \"I'm really sorry, there was a bit of a problem with the formulas in the Life and Death Account which miscalculated your merits and demerits. According to your life experiences, you should reincarnate as a human in your next life, and you'll be born into a rather well-to-do family.\"When Chen Kang heard this, he was overjoyed and said excitedly, \"Really?\"That colleague nodded. \"Really really. I just amended the result. I'll send you another text later. Please feel at ease and go back to preparing for your reincarnation.\"Chen Kang thanked him endlessly for his kindness. After the two exchanged pleasantries for awhile, the colleague probably felt embarra.s.sed and insisted on sending Chen Kang out of the company.It's just that, the two of them pa.s.sed straight through the company's door to leave.Yu Zhengdu maintained a dazed expression as he witnessed the entire process. After he saw his colleague and Chen Kang pa.s.s through the wall together, he finally found a little bit of his voice and looked at his other colleagues. \"Did you guys see that strange scene? Or was I hallucinating?\"His other colleagues looked up, and when they heard this, they all looked at one another before shaking their heads. \"Nope, everything's normal.\"Yu Zhengdu, \"\u2026\u2026\"After hearing the commotion outside, the beautiful and young boss Shang Que came out of his office to take a look. He asked, \"What's the matter?\"Yu Zhengdu turned around to look at him. Perhaps it was because he had suffered too big of a shock, but he now displayed exceptional calmness in the face of what he had just experienced. \"Boss, I think I encountered a ghost.\"Right after he said this, the colleague who sent Chen Kang off came back. And of course, he returned by pa.s.sing straight through the door.No ripples could be seen on Yu Zhengdu's face. He even tugged Shang Que's sleeve rather forcefully. \"Boss, did you see that?\"But all he saw was how Shang Que's expression didn't change in the slightest as he said to that colleague with displeasure, \"Kang Jin, why are you pa.s.sing through walls again? How many times have I told you that since we're working in an office building in the human's world, we have to seem more human. Don't bring over your ghostly habits.\"That colleague didn't expect to be caught on the spot by the boss, and he was so scared he almost lunged over straight away to hug his thigh. He shouted in horror, \"Aaahhhhh boss! I didn't do it on purpose, I just forgot about it in the moment. Please don't eat me ah\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu, \"\u2026\u2026\"Kang Jin was so frightened his ghostly apparition seemed to blur. It was only after he was rea.s.sured that the boss wouldn't eat him before he sighed in relief and shrunk his neck back to return to his workstation.Shang Que uttered a hng in dissatisfaction, then turned back to Yu Zhengdu and asked with the concern of a capitalist, \"Isn't it a little exciting?\"Yu Zhengdu flashed him a stiff smile that wasn't lacking in manners. The boss' words were really veiled, was this just a \"little\" exciting?Shang Que explained without the slightest guilt, \"Originally, I had intended to tell you the truth after you got used to the working environment\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu looked at Shang Que's face, so beautiful that it didn't seem to belong to a mortal, and suddenly felt like this was all really absurd.He thought that he should be afraid, but for some reason, he still had the energy to bargain. He asked, \"Boss, can I quit?\"Shang Que stared at him silently. After a while, he said slowly, \"You could have at first. We are a very humane company\u2026\u2026\"When Yu Zhengdu heard this capitalist that might be a ghost or some other monster say the word 'humane', the sense of absurdity that overwhelmed him felt even stronger.Shang Que rubbed his two thumbs together gently, \"But you've already signed the labour contract. Before the contract expires, it'll be better if you don't quit\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu was baffled, but he still struggled for his rights and interests. \"According to the provisions of the Labour Law, even after signing the contract, employees can still resign at any time\u2026\u2026\"He spoke without much confidence. A nagging sense of strangeness kept bothering him as he talked about labour laws with a ghost.Shang Que shrugged. \"There isn't any problem according to the laws of the human world, but what you signed was a contract of the underworld. Look at it like signing a contract with ghosts. If you forcibly nullify it before completing the contents of the agreement, it's very likely you'll suffer a backlash.\"Yu Zhengdu bravely rebuked, \"You guys did it on purpose ba. With that kind of clause, shouldn't you notify the labourer before letting them sign the contract?'Shang Que blinked. \"Weren't you the one who urgently requested for social security?\"Yu Zhengdu, \"\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu couldn't help but diss, \"Can such a\u2026\u2026company get social security?\"The ellipses had concealed a few sensitive words.Shang Que nodded as a matter of course and said seriously, \"We are a proper company that has a file in the Industry and Commerce Bureau.\"Yu Zhengdu flipped out.Socialism is too f.u.c.king amazing, even the ghosts are so hardcore.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayShang Que appeared too natural, and too serious. While feeling absent-minded, Yu Zhengdu suddenly had the misconception that everything in front of him was as it should be.The atmosphere that was supposed to be extremely horrifying had an inexplicable sense of comedy. Yu Zhengdu felt like he should shudder in fright for a while out of courtesy, but he really couldn't feel the slightest bit of fear. He stared fixedly at Shang Que for a long time, then finally asked, \"What kind of organisation is this exactly?\"\"To explain it in a way that's easier to understand\u2026\u2026\" Shang Que thought about it for a moment, then answered, \"It should be a h.e.l.l organisation in the human world?\"Yu Zhengdu fell into a trance. \"h.e.l.l?\"\"Un, the one you're thinking about right now.\" Shang Que smoothed his hair out. \"Let's talk inside.\"They entered Shang Que's office. Shang Que sat down in his chair, and his expression suddenly changed. \"Hold on for a moment.\"After he spoke, he dragged his keyboard over and his fingers seemed like they were flying as they \"pitter-patter\" like mad on the keyboard for awhile, then his expression softened. He didn't forget to curse angrily, \"d.a.m.n it, someone killed me while my computer was turned off.\"\"\u2026\u2026\" Yu Zhengdu cooperated with no emotion in his voice, \"How despicable.\"Shang Que turned his head around to look at him. \"Do you know how to write hacks? I want to hunt him down to the ends of the earth.\"Yu Zhengdu uttered his suggestion very slowly, \"You can just get your ghost employees to scare him.\"Shang Que, \"\u2026\u2026\"Shang Que logged out of the game and pretended as if nothing had happened. \"Let's get down to business.\"\"Simply put, our company is h.e.l.l.\" Shang Que dispensed with the formalities and dove straight to the point, \"Which is the afterworld as understood by the human world. We're in charge of the six paths of reincarnation, and we're responsible for putting humans on trial for the merits and demerits acc.u.mulated throughout their life \u2014 we're the netherworld's h.e.l.l that decides what the next life of the dead should be.\"Yu Zhengdu was so shocked he hiccuped. From the corner of his eye, he studied this office again that seemed a little plain, and deeply doubted his boss' words. But his fingers still subconsciously pointed downwards, \"Shouldn't h.e.l.l\u2026\u2026be underground?\"Shang Que placed one leg over the other and said in this graceful posture, \"Well, that would date back to what happened fifty years ago\u2026\u2026\"Ever since Pangu, separated the Sky from Earth, formless chaos was divided into three realms \u2014 heaven, the human realm and earth. Heaven became the divine realm, Earth became the ghost world, and between the heavens and the Earth was the human realm. Aside from these, there are the six reincarnation cycles, which differ from one another.The existence of the three realms and six cycles is mainly maintained by spiritual power and belief, but with the pa.s.sage of time, spiritual energy is gradually thinning out, The divine realm and the ghost world \u2014 that require a lot of spiritual energy to be maintained \u2014 became turbulent, and their foundations destablised. However, they were still barely held up by beliefs of the human world.\"Until fifty years ago\u2026\u2026\"When he spoke up to this point, Shang Que paused for a moment. Just one glance at him and you could tell that it must have been a period of history that unfolded on a magnificent scale.Yu Zhengdu couldn't help but move forward a little, and his tone sounded slightly agitated as well, \"What happened fifty years ago?\"Shang Que's gaze seemed profound as he said, \"Fifty years ago, China launched a large-scale campaign to Destroy the Four Olds and swept away everything related to ghosts and monsters. Belief in ghosts and G.o.ds in the human world collapsed completely, and this was equivalent to pulling the carpet from underneath the divine realm and ghost world that was on the verge of falling apart in the first place\u2026\u2026\"Once faith was lost, heaven and earth collapsed as well. The immortal world and underworld that once enjoyed the incense of the human world and possessed supreme power met their demise. Although the ghost world disappeared, there was still life, old age, illness and death in the human world, so ghosts were retained in the human world after death and their reincarnation relied purely on luck. The six paths of reincarnation was once in a very chaotic state.At the beginning, things like good people reincarnating into livestock and evil ones being born into rich families would occur once in awhile.\"The only way to resolve this problem is to reopen h.e.l.l. But the underworld has already caved in and disappeared, so now we can only rent offices in the human world to start work.\" Shang Que smiled slightly. He leaned forward and gently patted the back of Yu Zhengdu's hand, then comforted, \"But don't worry. Our company has undergone all the necessary procedures; we pay our taxes regularly every year, so we won't default on your salary.\"Yu Zhengdu, \"\u2026\u2026\"He had received too much information at once and didn't know how to react for a while. After a long pause, he asked with a dull look, \u201cYou're saying that, the destruction of heaven and earth was caused by the Destroy the Four Olds campaign?\u201dShang Que thought about it, then said, \"Not really. Destroy the Four Olds was just the last straw that broke the camel's back.\u201dYu Zhengdu continued looking dull. \u201cDo you know I got full marks in my Marxism cla.s.s?\u201d\u201cMarxist Philosophy?\u201d Shang Que nodded and displayed a great deal of admiration. \u201cLingxi showed me your academic transcript. It's very outstanding.\u201dYu Zhengdu let out a prolonged breath and rejoiced, \u201cFortunately, I'm graduating soon. If I were to take the exam now, there's an eighty percent chance I'd fail.\u201dJudging by how his materialistic beliefs had just been shattered into pieces alone, it was likely that he would never be able to confront examination papers regarding the scientific outlook on development with a normal mindset again.As a ghost, Shang Que's temper was considered not bad. Perhaps it was because he was afraid to scare away the programmer they took a lot of effort to recruit, but he was quite patient with Yu Zhengdu and explained the nature of their company to him properly. But that was it.\u201cTake your time to settle down ba, we can talk about work again tomorrow.\u201d Shang Que issued a notice of leave to his visitor.Yu Zhengdu got up dizzily. Right before he left, he turned back again to ask, \u201cIf this is the organisation of h.e.l.l, then aren't you\u2026\u2026?\u201dHe looked at the face that could delude people even without the magic of any supernatural being, and just found it absolutely unfathomable. \u201cYama?\u201dShang Que looked disgusted. \u201cOf course not.\u201dYu Zhengdu, \u201c\u2026\u2026then you are?\u201dShang Que, \u201cI am the legal representative of the company.\u201dYu Zhengdu couldn't help but diss, \u201c\u2026\u2026a ghost representative ba.\u201dShang Que saw his speechless look, and only then did a sudden realisation dawn upon him. \u201cAre you asking me about my previous ident.i.ty?\u201dHe smiled slightly. \u201cA thousand years ago, people in the human world who offered sacrifices to me generally called me the Ghost King of Luofeng Mountain.\u201dYu Zhengdu left Shang Que's office and saw a dozen colleagues outside looking over with their heads stretched out and their gazes burning with the spirit of gossip. The one called Kang Jin asked guiltily, \u201cNew colleague, do you know everything now?\u201dYu Zhengdu looked at them expressionlessly. \u201cThat you're all ghosts?\u201dAs soon as he finished speaking, he saw the expression of his uptight colleagues suddenly relax and they all nodded one after another. \u201cYeah, yeah.\u201dKang Jin also breathed a sigh of relief. \u201cIt's good that you know now, it's really difficult for us to keep pretending to be humans.\u201dAfter he spoke, he held his head with both hands. \u201cI was so scared just now that my head fell off.\u201dYu Zhengdu quickly shouted at him to stop, \u201cSTOP THAT!!!!\u201dKang Jin looked over with a baffled expression.Yu Zhengdu cried in surprise, \u201cDon't take your head off! I won't be able to stand it!\u201dKang Jin: \u201c\u2026\u2026I just wanted to straighten my wig.\"He felt a little aggrieved. \u201cOur boss doesn't like bald employees.\u201dYu Zhengdu sighed. \u201cSo even ghosts can be bald too.\u201dIf he had a choice, Yu Zhengdu wouldn't want to work with ghosts. Although Shang Que a.s.sured him that they were a very proper company, they are still ghosts in the end ah!At present, however, he has no choice. According to what Shang Que said, the labor contract he signed with Luofeng can not be easily breached because one of the parties involved is part of the netherworld, so it was considered a contract between a human and a ghost. Otherwise, the one who breaches the contract would likely suffer a backlash.Most importantly, the company claims to be responsible for the reincarnation of the dead. Although it looks very much like a hoax, if it was true, Yu Zhengdu fears that they would take revenge in a hundred years if he were to just pat his a.s.s and walk away now. He could even end up reincarnating into a chicken or duck in his next life.Yu Zhengdu sighed and sat back down at his workstation.Unexpectedly, people were still chatting pa.s.sionately in his WeChat cla.s.s group. Looking at it carefully, he saw that Hou Guangzong was the performer.Hou Guangzong: [Actually, Nova isn't much la, it's not as high-end as everyone thinks it is)Hou Guangzong: [But there are quite a lot of impressive people here, it's quite a pity that Zhengdu didn't come]Hou Guangzong: [Which company is Zhengdu working in now? It must be even more amazing than Nova ba]Hou Guangzong: [@Yu Zhengdu, where are you? Tell everyone about your new company ma]Hou Guangzong: [Isn't Zhengdu being a bit too petty? What's there to hide]Hou Guangzong: [@Yu Zhengdu]Yu Zhengdu looked up at his new colleagues. After their ident.i.ties were exposed, they were obviously much more relaxed both physically and mentally. For example, right at this moment, a colleague was floating straight to another colleague's workstation. \u201cHelp me take a look, how should I set up this excel formula\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dForget it, forget it, it's fine as long as they don't perform an act where their heads start dropping all over the place.Yu Zhengdu: [Un, my new company is especially amazing]Yu Zhengdu: [The kind that can scare people to death, smile.jpg]Yu Zhengdu formally started working in Luofeng. After a few days pa.s.sed by like this, he had also come to know a lot more things.For example, this company purports to be the h.e.l.l Organisation in the human world, that they're in charge of all management work dealing with people after their death\u2026\u2026and they were especially poor. When Shang Que said that the company had to scrimp to save enough money to hire him, he was actually telling the truth.The so-called increase in business refers to the start of the second child policy, which led to an increase in the number of reincarnations. It doesn't actually make any money.Yu Zhengdu, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe colleagues of this poora.s.s company also agreed unanimously that they couldn't be blamed for being poor, they could only blame the human world for not accepting h.e.l.l bank notes, otherwise their boss would be the richest man in the world.Yu Zhengdu felt that their reasoning was so logical that it was impossible to refute.The little money they have of the human world in their account was contributed by people who took their name at face value, who believed that this company was involved in businesses such as career planning and personal health management.Yu Zhengdu: worrying about my salary everyday.At noon that day, he went downstairs to eat in the dining hall alone.Due to the remote location of the Science Park in the development zone, there weren't a lot of restaurants in the vicinity at the beginning. In order to attract companies to set up their offices here, the Science Park turned one of its floors into a dining hall.Yu Zhengdu was the only living person in the company, so he would report to the dining hall every day.He had just picked up his food when three girls suddenly came over with trays in hand. The one in the middle with a bob hairstyle waved to him.Yu Zhengdu glanced at them and thought they seemed a little familiar.The short-haired girl smiled a little shyly at him. \u201ch.e.l.lo, I often see you eating alone here.\u201dYu Zhengdu thought about it for a while, then remembered that he seemed to have met them several times before. They would even size him up secretly from time to time.Yu Zhengdu has always been good-looking since he was a child, so he was used to this type of situation. He smiled and said, \u201ch.e.l.lo, the three of you seem to eat here often as well?\u201dThe short-haired girl and the girl on the right glanced at each other, then grumbled coyly, \u201cWhaaaat? There's clearly only the two of us here.\u201dThe girl on the right also said, \u201cAren't you being a bit too mean? Trying to scare us right at our first meeting.\u201dYu Zhengdu felt a sudden chill run down his spine; he abruptly broke out in a cold sweat and all his hair stood on end.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayYu Zhengdu was shocked by the words of the two girls. At that moment, the girl standing on the far left suddenly threw him a strange smile. Then, her eyes rolled up slowly, until the whites of her eyeb.a.l.l.s that were crawling with veins could be seen. Meanwhile, bright red blood began trickling out of her eye sockets.White eyeb.a.l.l.s, red blood tears, coupled with a malicious smile \u2014 this scene was as weird as it could get.Yu Zhengdu, \u201c\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu thanked his ghost company for the first time. After a few days of training his psychological state of mind there, he could still maintain an unchanged expression in the face of such a scene and calmly say to the short-haired girl, \u201cI actually failed to frighten you, I thought my acting was pretty realistic.\u201dThe short-haired girl grinned and said, \u201cIt was very realistic, but the method was a bit outdated.\u201dWhen the female ghost saw that Yu Zhengdu didn't get a fright, she felt doubtful for a moment and couldn't tell if he had seen her or not.Just as the three of them found a table to sit down, in order to test Yu Zhengdu, the female ghost scuttled to the seat that Yu Zhengdu was going to occupy, then confidently sat down first and looked at Yu Zhengdu proudly, ready to see what his reaction was.Yu Zhengdu, \u201c\u2026\u201dIt's time to see who was the better actor.His expression remained unchanged. As he continued to talk to the two girls, he sat down calmly on the female ghost's lap.Female Ghost: my smile is gradually fading away.Fortunately, at the last moment, the female ghost could not accept having a living person sit on her thigh after all, so she quickly fled just as Yu Zhengdu was about to crush her.Yu Zhengdu inwardly breathed a sigh of relief. Honestly, he was pretty stressed about actually having to sit on the lap of a female ghost.Perhaps it was because she was certain that Yu Zhengdu couldn't see her, but the female ghost was too lazy to hara.s.s him anymore. She went back to the short-haired girl and stuck to her closely.Yu Zhengdu and the two girls introduced themselves to one other. The short-haired girl was named Li Tiantian, and her friend was named Jiang Hong. They both worked in a game company at another building of the park.Li Tiantian smiled and said, \u201cYou're always alone every time I see you. Why don't you have lunch with your colleagues?\u201dYu Zhengdu said perfunctorily, \u201cMy colleagues and I have different tastes, so we can't eat together.\u201dJiang Hong glanced at Yu Zhengdu's lunch tray and said, \u201cYour taste seems pretty common ah.\u201dYu Zhengdu, \u201cUn, they're the ones with uncommon tastes.\u201dThe three chatted while eating. When Li Tiantian and Jiang Hong learned that Yu Zhengdu had just arrived here to work, they enthusiastically introduced the situation on this side of the Science Park to him. The atmosphere between them wasn't awkward at all.But Li Tiantian would stretch and rub her shoulders from time to time. She complained, \u201cI don't know why, but I've always felt very tired recently. My shoulders are always so d.a.m.n sore, as if they're being pressed down on by something.\u201dJiang Hong said, \u201cShould be an occupational hazard ba, people with desk jobs have the highest chance of getting frozen shoulders, cervical spondylosis and other stuff like that.\u201dLi Tiantian muttered, \u201cI used to sit like this all the time, but I've never felt so tired ah. Also, there seems to be something wrong with my neck recently. It'll just suddenly start feeling cold from time to time.\u201dYu Zhengdu, \u201c\u2026\u201dHe saw that the ghost was currently draping her arm around Li Tiantian's shoulders, and had even huffed on her neck.Jiang Hong, \u201cWhy don't you take a day off to go see a doctor one of these days?\u201dLi Tiantian continued, \u201cI think it's a problem with my luck. Not only have I been feeling sick lately, but I've also been quite unlucky. I was almost hit by a car when I went out the other day. It didn't rain yesterday, and I don't know what happened either but I actually stepped into a puddle on the road. I even made a few mistakes in my work too and got scolded by my supervisor\u2026\u201dShe rattled on for a while, and seemed to finally realise that Yu Zhengdu was still listening at one side so she stopped in a hurry. Her face was a little red as she said, \u201cSorry for talking so much all of a sudden.\u201dYu Zhengdu smiled and said, \u201cThat's all right. If you feel uncomfortable, it'd be better for you to get it checked out at a hospital.\u201dThey finished their meal very quickly. Before leaving, Li Tiantian even added Yu Zhengdu's WeChat and said, \u201cSince we're all in the same park, let's meet again for lunch when we're free.\u201dYu Zhengdu nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201dHe watched Li Tiantian and Jiang Hong leave, unperturbed, then calmly turned around and walked towards the company. Only when he was sure that the ghost could not see him anymore did he finally howl with an \"ao\u2014\u2014\" and almost darted back as if someone was chasing him with a knife.\u201cEveryone, I, I, I\u2014\u2014 I b.u.mped into a ghost\u2014\u2014\u201d Yu Zhengdu pushed open the door of the company and shouted.The ghost colleagues in the office all looked up at him in succession: \u201c\u2026\u201dThe atmosphere was a little awkward for a moment.Yu Zhengdu also kept silent for a while. The force of his entrance weakened, then he added, \u201cIt's particularly terrifying to b.u.mp into ghosts other than you guys\u2026\u201dAt this time, a colleague came out of the pantry with a bowl in hand and asked, \u201cIn what way was it terrifying?\u201dYu Zhengdu turned his head around to answer him, \u201cShe could do a super roll-up of her eyes, and her eyes could even bleed\u2026\u201dAfter speaking halfway, he suddenly couldn't continue any longer. This colleague of his had empty eye sockets \u2014 its insides were pitch dark, and his eyeb.a.l.l.s were nowhere to be seen.Yu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026where are your eyes?\u201dWhen his colleague heard this, he lifted the bowl up until it was in front of Yu Zhengdu. Yu Zhengdu looked down, only to see that the bowl was filled with clear water in which two round\u2026eyeb.a.l.l.s were soaking. Its black pupils were looking straight at him through the clear water.His colleague said, \u201cStaring at the computer all day made my eyes a little tired, so I took them out to soak them in eyedrops for a while.\u201dYu Zhengdu felt like his whole soul just underwent a thorough baptism. He pressed his hand against his chest and said especially sincerely, \u201cThank you for toughening my heart. I don't think that ghost is all that terrifying anymore.\u201dWhen Shang Que heard the noise, he came out of the office and asked, \u201cHow did you b.u.mp into the ghost?\u201dYu Zhengdu roughly talked about the situation with the female ghost and finally asked, \u201cWhy am I able to see ghosts now? I didn't have this skill before.\u201dShang Que: \u201cOh, you're a staff of h.e.l.l after signing the contract, that's part of our employee benefits.\u201dYu Zhengdu, \u201c\u2026\u201d He shouldn't have coveted that bit of social security!Shang Que continued, \u201cWhat you met was a Scapegoat Ghost. She's consuming that girl you're talking about in preparation for possessing her.\u201dYu Zhengdu was not very clear about the cla.s.sification of ghosts, but he could tell that it was definitely not a good ghost after listening to this description. He nervously said at once, \u201cWhat should we do then? Is Li Tiantian in danger?\"Shang Que deserved to be called the boss of all ghosts. He said with an indifferent expression, \u201cIt'll be fine as long as we catch her back.\u201dYu Zhengdu was surprised. \u201cOur company can even catch ghosts?\u201dShang Que smiled. \u201cWe're professionals.\u201dThe next day, Yu Zhengdu came up with the excuse of giving Li Tiantian something and asked the other two to meet up in the dining hall again. Then, he brought Shang Que along in a valiant effort to catch a ghost.Sure enough, the ghost was still pestering Li Tiantian. Yu Zhengdu tacitly tossed Shang Que a look, then introduced him to the two girls as if nothing had happened, \u201cThis is my boss, he'll be having lunch with us today.\u201dLi Tiantian and Jiang Hong's eyes lit up in an instant. \u201cYour boss is so handsome.\u201dShang Que looked nonchalant. \u201cThank you.\u201dSeveral people went to get their lunch together. Yu Zhengdu asked his boss in a soft voice, \u201cThat ghost didn't seem to realise that you're of the same kind?\u201dShang Que revealed a smile that seemed a little belittling. \u201cJudging by her level, she won't be able to find out if I don't want her to.\u201dYu Zhengdu respectfully gave him a thumbs up. \u201cBoss deserves to be the lord of all ghosts, you're amazing.\u201dShang Que: \u201c\u2026the 'king' of all ghosts.\u201dYu Zhengdu, \u201cIt's the same, it's the same.\u201dThey sat down after getting their food and Li Tiantian looked at Yu Zhengdu, appearing slightly embarra.s.sed. \u201cYou said in your WeChat message that you have something you want to give me. What is it?\u201dYu Zhengdu remembered his excuse and quickly took out a small box from his pocket to hand it over. \u201cThis.\u201d\u201cThat's so kind of you.\u201d Li Tiantian uncovered it, br.i.m.m.i.n.g with expectations as she opened it, and then, \u201c\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu said, \u201cDidn't you say you had a problem with your luck? Our company deals with personal health management. This is our company's magnet, it can change your luck and give you a health boost.\"Li Tiantian, \u201c\u2026\u201dJiang Hong, \u201c\u2026\u201dThe box clearly contained a very plain pebble that wasn't unusual in any way. At most, you could say that it was a little more smooth and round, and was washed to be a little cleaner than most.Li Tiantian's smile froze. \u201cThank you.\u201dThe female ghost seemed to find Yu Zhengdu's words particularly ridiculous. She approached Li Tiantian on purpose and huffed a breath onto her face, her provocation completely undisguised.Li Tiantian touched her face subconsciously. Yu Zhengdu also poked Shang Que's thigh under the table. Shang Que turned to look at him, appearing like he didn't quite comprehend Yu Zhengdu's action.Yu Zhengdu looked at him with a smile and frantically hinted at him with his gaze: hurry and do something ah!Evidently, Shang Que has not yet fostered an exchange-of-gazes rapport with him, so he just stared at Yu Zhengdu blankly. Yu Zhengdu, \"\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu had to resort to leaning close to his ear and he tried his best to suppress his voice, \u201cWhy aren't you doing anything yet? That ghost is being way too arrogant!\u201dShang Que has been a ghost for a long time, but this was the first time a human leaned in so close to talk to him. The warm breath that only a living person could have swept past his ear; it was an experience he had never experienced before.Shang Que patted the back of his hand gently and said, \u201cCalm down.\u201dAfter he spoke, he suddenly smiled in the direction of the female ghost.The female ghost was stunned. She wasn't sure if he was looking at her, then she saw him lift his chin again. The female ghost glanced in the direction where he was looking at and saw two ghosts in the distance; they wielded sticks as they rushed through the crowd aggressively, and shouted at the ghost while rus.h.i.+ng over, \u201cThat one over there, that ghost! You're under arrest.\u201dThe other also cried out, \u201cFace that wall, put your hands on your head and squat down. Male ghosts on the left, female ghosts on the right\u2014\u2014\u201dThe female ghost, who had been clinging onto Li Tiantian, shrieked in misery upon seeing this. She abruptly sprung up on the spot and dashed madly out of the canteen while crying, \u201cI didn't do anything bad, I was just pa.s.sing by\u2014\u2014\u201dYu Zhengdu, \u201c\u2026\u201dTwo of his ghost colleagues pursued her relentlessly and didn't forget to shoot their mouths off while doing so, \u201cBehave yourself. If you didn't do anything bad, what are you running for?!\u201d\u201cCome back with us to a.s.sist in our investigation, you won't be able to get away\u2014\u2014\u201dYu Zhengdu, \u201c\u2026\u201dIf he hadn't known that these were ghosts, he would have thought he had b.u.mped into an anti-p.o.r.nography operation.Shang Que then laughed and explained to him, \u201cI don't need to act personally for such a trivial matter.\u201dYu Zhengdu nodded numbly, then respectfully picked up his braised pork with his chopsticks to place it onto Shang Que's plate. \u201cBoss, you've worked hard. Eat more braised pork.\u201dJiang Hong, who was sitting opposite, finally couldn't endure it any longer. She sent a WeChat message to Li Tiantian secretly on her mobile phone: [I can't stand it anymore. Not only is this guy a miserly stone-giver, but he's also a bootlicker]Li Tiantian: [Don't say anything more, I want to die\u2026]At the same time, Shang Que looked down at the braised pork in front of him and contemplated deeply.Only then did Yu Zhengdu react. He quickly took the pork back and said, \u201cI almost forgot, you don't eat this\u2026\u201dWhile he was mid-sentence, the pork on his chopsticks was stopped.Shang Que said, \u201cThen I'll try it ba.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis meal was finished even faster than yesterday's. Li Tiantian looked a bit wilted, and Jiang Hong didn't speak much, while Yu Zhengdu was anxious to return to the company to see the result of their ghost-catching operation.After this arduous lunch was over, Yu Zhengdu tried his best to suppress his gossipy urges and watched the two girls leave in a gentlemanly manner. Only then did he take his boss's hand in a hurry as he wanted to run back to the company, \u201cLet's go let's go, time to eat some watermelon.\u201dBut just as his hand touched Shang Que's wrist, it bounced back. He subconsciously said, \u201cAh, your hand is so cold.\u201dShang Que looked at him, and Yu Zhengdu snapped out of his daze. He scratched his head and said, \u201cI'm sorry, but I'll forget you're not a human being sometimes.\u201dShang Que: \u201c\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu realised that he sounded too much like he was scolding his boss. He pondered for a moment and tried to make up for it, \u201cBoss, if I say you look a lot like a human now, would you feel a little better?\u201dShang Que looked like he was left speechless with a bunch of ellipses above his head. Fortunately, he didn't seem to mind it much, and after a moment of silence, he said, \u201cThat's all right. I forgot to adjust the temperature too.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu felt like he just opened the door to a new world, \u201cThis kind of temperature can be adjusted?\u201dShang Que smiled proudly, \u201cOf course.\u201dAfter he spoke, he silently stretched out his left hand. \u201cTry again.\u201dYu Zhengdu, \u201c\u2026\u201d I don't know if it's a misperception or not, but I feel like my boss' always has a rather strong desire to show off?He muttered to himself, but still touched his hands. The skin he touched this time was indeed warm. Shang Que's skin differed from that of a normal man; his resembled a white jade with an unhealthy pallid tone, but it was warm and smooth to the touch.It was a unique sensation that couldn't be found on anyone else.Yu Zhengdu was amazed. \u201cWow, it's like a real human's.\u201dAs soon as he spoke, he realised that the wrist he was holding got warmer, and its temperature seemed to still be on the rise.He paused, \u201cBoss, stop before going too far ba. You'll burn me if you continue raising your temperature.\u201dShang Que smiled slightly, \u201cIt's still okay.\u201dYu Zhengdu sighed, \u201cSince you have this kind of skill, you should use it to control the office's temperature ah. It'll even save on air conditioning fees.\u201dShang Que, \u201c\u2026\u201dWhen they returned to the company, Yu Zhengdu pushed the door open and asked, \u201cWhere's the ghost? Where is it?\u201dOne of his colleagues involved in the arrest pointed at a corner. \u201cThere.\u201d\u201cHow did you guys catch it?\u201d Yu Zhengdu asked curiously while turning his head to look at it, \u201cIs it the same as in TV series? Like using hooks? Or tying them up with a rope\u2026\u201dWhile he was mid-sentence, he couldn't go on anymore. In the corner of the company, a ghost was squatting there with her long hair in a dishevelled mess. Both her hands were placed in front of her knees, and they were currently shackled in a pair of handcuffs.Yu Zhengdu, \u201c\u2026\u201dThe anti-p.o.r.nography operation scene has appeared once again.Yu Zhengdu looked back at Shang Que and said with heartfelt admiration, \u201cI didn't expect ghost-catching to be so advanced now too.\u201dThe female ghost also saw him at this time. She was in a listless state, but immediately became agitated upon seeing him. She abruptly burst up and stormed forward, \u201cYou can see me! You can see me!! You actually pretended that you couldn't see me\u2014\u2014\"As soon as the female ghost got agitated, her eyes began rolling up again. Her seven orifices started bleeding at the same time, and her appearance was as terrifying as it could get.Yu Zhengdu took two steps back in horror. He even tripped over his right foot with his left and nearly fell down. Fortunately, Shang Que stood next to him and supported him just in time.But the female ghost couldn't lunge over in the end. Lu Lingxi sprung out of nowhere, seized the female ghost and pushed her back into the corner. She said, \u201cBehave yourself. Why is a criminal suspect like you talking so much?\u201dBlood was flowing even faster from her seven orifices now, and her face was on the verge of being submerged in her own blood. At the same time, she was still struggling as she refused to give in. \u201cI didn't commit any crimes, I didn't harm anyone, it was that man who wronged me\u2014\u2014\u201dYu Zhengdu didn't even dare to look straight at her anymore. He covered his eyes and said, \u201cJust speak normally, could you stop bleeding all over the place?\u201dShang Que chuckled. He looked at the ghost and said, \u201cDid you hear that?\u201dFemale Ghost, \u201c\u2026\u201dThe bloodstains on the ghost's face quickly dried up and vanished. Not only did she stop bleeding, but even her tears dared not come out, and she shut up while feeling very aggrieved.When Lu Lingxi saw that she dared not howl any more, she escorted her to Kang Jin, the ghost who wore a wig, and said, \u201cRecord her testimony.\u201dYu Zhengdu felt that the picture in front of him was somewhat incredible. He asked Shang Que, \u201cCan I go over to take a look?\u201dShang Que nodded.Yu Zhengdu cheered and skipped over to Kang Jin. Kang Jin sat upright in front of the computer, skillfully clicked on a folder, and retrieved an excel sheet.Yu Zhengdu looked at the name of the excel sheet and felt his eyes hurting again. \u201cWait a minute, why is this doc.u.ment called the Life and Death Account?\u201dKang Jin said as a matter of course, \u201cBecause this is the Life and Death Account ah.\u201dShang Que walked over slowly with both hands crossed in front of his chest. \u201cWe have always been devoting our efforts to modernizing h.e.l.l's office and improving our work efficiency. Changing the Life and Death Account into such a format is one of our most significant achievements.\u201dKang Jin also added while sounding pleased, \u201cMoreover, we have set up various calculation formulas in this excel sheet to calculate each person's merits and demerits in a scientific, rapid, and rigorous manner. Ever since we advocated using computers for our work, our error rate on matters related to the reincarnation of ghosts has greatly decreased, thereby effectively maintaining the order of the six paths of reincarnation.\u201dFinally, he didn't forget to flatter his boss,: \u201cOf course, this was all thanks to our boss's foresight for abandoning the old way of doing things in h.e.l.l so early\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu was on the verge of vomiting blood after listening to him. He turned to look at Shang Que, but he saw Shang Que smiling at him with a dubious smile. \u201cBut I don't think that's enough. I hope we can have an even more advanced and independent working system in the future.\u201d\u201cYou recruited me in order to develop a program for handling the Life and Death Account?\u201dShang Que nodded. \u201cYes. I hope that by 2020, we will be able to fully automate the process of reincarnation.\u201dYu Zhengdu, \u201c\u2026?!\u201dThis beautiful, young boss of his could really shock him a great deal from time to time!Over on the other side, Kang Jin had already begun to interrogate the female ghost. \u201cHey you, what's your name?\u201dKnowing that she had no chance of escape, the ghost could only look at Yu Zhengdu with bitter resentment and reluctantly said, \u201cXu Jiangjiang.\u201dKang Jin entered her name on the excel, which brought up a long list of records. He asked again, \u201cID number.\u201dThe female ghost reported a number. Kang Jin checked it out, and there was only one option left on the excel list.Yu Zhengdu took a look, only to see that the basic information and female ghost's entire life was recorded on the list, and finally there was a remark at the end which says: lived to the ripe age of 25, committed suicide by leaving the gas on in a rental house.Kang Jin asked, \u201cWhy did you want to possess Li Tiantian's body?\u201dXu Jiangjiang denied the accusation three times, \u201cI didn't want to, I wasn't trying to, I was just pa.s.sing by.\u201dKang Jin, \u201cThere's no use trying to come up with excuses for yourself. We're a company from the netherworld, we work differently from the human world. We have all sorts of ways to make you tell the truth.\u201dYu Zhengdu asked curiously, \u201cHow? Through torture?\u201dXu Jiangjiang glared at Yu Zhengdu, then Kang Jin continued, \u201cWe have already extracted the ghost Qi you left on Li Tiantian, which proves that you have been pestering her for at least 20 days\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu, \u201c\u2026\u201d Do you ghosts have to be so scientific in handling cases?Kang Jin continued, \u201cMoreover, Li Tiantian's ophryon is now black (means her luck is c.r.a.p) and her seven pos are unstable. These are all precursors of being possessed. If you weren't preparing to possess her, then what did you do all that for?\u201dSeeing that she could not deny her charges, Xu Jiangjiang reluctantly said, \u201cYes, I wanted to possess her.\u201dKang Jin knocked on the table. \u201cAfter you died, we should have sent you a text message informing you of various matters you needed to pay attention to as a ghost. Amongst these matters, harming the living and looking for a scapegoat are strictly forbidden. I shouldn't have to tell you again what the consequences are for violating the relevant taboos ba.\u201dXu Jiangjiang hung her head and got agitated again when she heard this. \u201cI didn't want to do that either, but you guys said that reincarnation for suicide victims would be delayed. Now that the birth rate is so low, coupled with the delay in reincarnation, I would have to be a wandering soul in the human world for at least 50 years. I couldn't wait any longer\u2026\u201dKang Jin was going to continue talking about the laws with her, but he was actually stunned for a moment after hearing her say this, and he didn't know how to refute her. Instead, it was Yu Zhengdu who was a bit puzzled and asked, \u201cAren't you a rather contradictory ghost?\u201dXu Jiangjiang and Kang Jin turned their heads to look at him at the same time.Yu Zhengdu said, \u201cSince you committed suicide, it means that you don't want to be a human being anymore. In that case, why complain about not being able to reincarnate sooner?\u201dKang Jin's logic came back all of a sudden, and he immediately smacked the table. \u201cYes, that's precisely it.\u201dXu Jiangjiang looked at Yu Zhengdu indignantly and said, \u201cI committed suicide because I my previous life was really rough. My parents divorced, n.o.body cared about me since I was a child, I had a bad job, a low salary, and I had no friends. There was no meaning to me in living at all, but Li Tiantian was different. She has such a good life. Her parents love her, her friends like her, she had a good job, and everything about her life was great. I've always dreamt of having a life like hers\u2026\"She spilled the beans as she described her train of thought, and in the end, her eyes were almost completely covered in a greedy glint.Yet Yu Zhengdu only felt an indescribable chill suffuse throughout his body. He said in earnest, \u201cThat's no reason for your suicide, nor is it a reason for you to harm others.\u201dXu Jiangjiang refused to give in. \u201cWhy can she live such a good life, while I had to have such a miserable one!\u201dYu Zhengdu looked at her. \u201cYou didn't cherish your own life, yet you want to pick up other people's ready-made one. For someone like you, even if you possess Li Tiantian, will you really be satisfied? You'll always meet people who are living a better life than you, will you think it's unfair then and hurt other people again?Kang Jin nodded forcefully. \u201cYes, that's precisely it.\u201dYu Zhengdu cast a sidelong glance at him, is this ghost a repeater?Xu Jiangjiang said, \u201cYou-you-you're just spouting nonsense\u2026\u201dShang Que, who has just been spectating for a long time, spoke slowly at this time, \u201cYou really have a lot of rubbish to say.\u201dAfter he spoke, his forefinger hooked the air slightly, and Xu Jiangjiang uttered a surprised cry. Her entire ghost being was being pinched by Shang Que.Xu Jiangjiang was particularly fierce in front of Yu Zhengdu, but she could not even budge an inch in Shang Que's. Her eyes were bulging out as if they could fall out of their sockets at any time. The upper and lower rows of her teeth kept chittering, and she was so stunned she couldn't even utter a word.Yu Zhengdu got a huge fright. \u201cBoss, are you going to eat this ghost on the spot? Give me a moment, I'll leave for a while.\u201dKang Jin, \u201c\u2026shut up, don't remind Boss.\u201dBut Shang Que didn't say anything and just glanced around, then raised his free hand and a bottle flew through the air before he caught iy.Yu Zhengdu looked at it. Isn't that the mineral water bottle that he had drunk half of?Immediately afterward, he saw Shang Que grab Xu Jiangjiang and stuff her straight into the bottle. Then he said lightly, \u201cKeep it closed for twenty years ba.\u201dYu Zhengdu, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHe suddenly knew what the bottles on the bookshelf in Boss' office \u2014 which were a complete mismatch with everything else \u2014 were.Yu Zhengdu didn't know what he was thinking either, but at this moment, he actually said while feeling stunned, \u201cBoss, I haven't finished drinking from it yet.\u201dShang Que looked at him, handed the bottle over and said, \u201cIt's all right. Continue drinking from it ba, the taste isn't affected.\u201dThe author has something to say:Zhengdu: My major has been challenged by 0.0Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I looked up the company you're currently working at online, it's a bit small, what a waste for you to go there\u3011Hou Guangzong:\u3010Look, I can even personally meet an executive at Ox Factory even though I'm only an intern at Nova. I think it would be better for you to stop wasting your time at such a small company\u3011Yu Zhengdu just arrived at the company and hadn't started working yet. He was eating breakfast while scrolling through WeChat, simply ignoring Hou Guangzong's comments and instead opening the news article Zhang Qingqing linked:Local headline: During this morning's rush hour, several small cars driving down the Ancient Well district's main road suddenly lost control, automatically speeding up and straying from the normal path, almost causing a traffic accident. Fortunately, everything returned to normal after the mild disturbance. All drivers involved reported they were unclear of what happened; according to inspection results, the cars' functions were all normal. The cause of the incident is still under investigation. [Video]He was only halfway through the news when he saw Lu Lingxi stand up and call for two of their coworkers. \"Qu Lv, Chen Yangli, you two head out with Boss for an outside the office trip.\"Yu Zhengdu looked up curiously and asked, \"Our company has need for outside the office trips?\"Lu Lingxi glanced at him, saying, \"There was a ghost at the Ancient Well reincarnation point who refused to reincarnate, and even urged a few other ghosts to escape too. They commandeered several humans who were in the middle of driving and almost caused an enormous catastrophe. We need to take care of the situation.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\"He looked at Lu Lingxi, then at the news on his phone, and almost spat out the breakfast in his mouth.He swallowed the last of his bread and asked, \"Is it the same event as the one that made the local headline?\"At this time Shang Que happened to walk out, he made a noise of agreement and said, \"This time the effects are a little severe, so I will go personally.\"The coworker named Chen Yangli complained, \"But right now we still don't know where those ghosts escaped to. It'll be a bit difficult to find them.\"Qu Lv was also extremely unhappy. \"Guess we'll have to work overtime the next few days. Ah, I'm so angry!\"Yu Zhengdu was just about to say something when he saw an abundance of WeChat notifications light up his phone.Zhang Qingqing:\u3010My goodness, what day is it today, our company's elevator suddenly broke. It's stuck between the 17th and 18th floors\u3011Zhu Yan:\u3010No way?\u3011Zhang Qingqing:\u3010It's so tragic, it seems like dozens of people are inside. The repair team hasn't found the cause even after all this time\u3011Cla.s.smate A:\u3010That's terrifying, if I were stuck inside I would probably be scared half to death\u3011Zhang Qingqing:\u3010They already called the fire department, and will probably have to force the door open\u3011Cla.s.smate B:\u3010Frightening, but isn't that very dangerous?\u3011Zhang Qingqing:\u3010My G.o.d my G.o.d my G.o.d\u3011Zhang Qingqing:\u3010Oh my G.o.d\u3011Cla.s.smate A:\u3010?

Awkward\u3011Yu Zhengdu saw the news in the group and linked the location of Ox Factory to the site of the news incident. A thought flashed through his head, and he told Shang Que, \"Boss, I may have guessed where those runaway ghosts are now.\"He stated his own theory. Shang Que thought about it before saying, \"Chen Yangli and Qu Lv go investigate the Ancient Well reincarnation point first.\"Then he looked to Yu Zhengdu. \"You and I will go to the Double Horn building.\"Yu Zhengdu rubbed his hands in antic.i.p.ation. \"How will we get there? Flying in the sky or burrowing underground? Or can we get there after just closing and opening our eyes?\"Shang Que stood up, gracefully adjusting the hem of his s.h.i.+rt. \"We'll call a taxi.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\"The image of a dirt poor boss remains. It's fine that the form of transportation is not otherworldly at all, but the Boss of h.e.l.l doesn't even own a car\u2026\u2026Double Horn Technology was one of Fu City's old game companies, respectfully known as Ox Factory by those in the field. It owned a large, single-standing building in the Ancient Well district of Fu City. When Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que arrived at the Double Horn building, two firetrucks were already parked outside the entrance. Several individuals dressed as firefighters were transporting tools, and many pa.s.sersby had stopped walking to watch.Shang Que paused in front of the building and lifted his face to look at the gla.s.s walls. His good-looking eyes seemed like endless pits. He said, \"Un, there are some ghosts in this building.\"He then glanced at the firefighters walking on the side. \"These people alone won't be able to open the elevator.\"Because of the elevator incident, the Double Horn building had temporarily stopped receiving guests with no pre-scheduled appointments, and had also began strict regulation of people who entered and exited the building.Yu Zhengdu thus turned to look at Shang Que again. \"Quick, Boss, use your illusion to sneak in.\"Shang Que looked askance at him. \"We are ghosts from a formal company; we must follow human laws when in the human realm. Tell your friend to come out and get us.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026Tsk.\"When Zhang Qingqing saw him she was slightly confused. \"Why have you come to our company too?\"Yu Zhengdu placed a hand over his chest and stated, \"I heard Guangzong was stuck in the elevator and was extremely worried, so I've rushed over to check on the situation.\"Zhang Qingqing was immediately shocked. \"I never imagined, you and Guangzong have such a good relations.h.i.+p!\"Yu Zhengdu responded with a sincere expression, \"We're all cla.s.smates.\"Zhang Qingqing was moved by this pure cla.s.smate camaraderie. \"As expected, true friends.h.i.+p can only be seen during difficult times, I'm sure Guangzong would be so touched\u2026\u2026\"Halfway through talking, she suddenly noticed Shang Que who was standing to the side. Her eyes immediately lit up, and she asked, \"Is this your friend?\"Yu Zhengdu blinked, saying, \"This is my boss. He heard my cla.s.smate got stuck in an elevator and was so worried that he sent me over to check.\"Zhang Qingqing suddenly felt that true compa.s.sion still existed in the world, lamenting: \"Your boss is a really good person.\"Yu Zhengdu nodded, but only smiled without saying anything.Zhang Qingqing said, \"Then come with me. Right now the 17th and 18th floors are filled with firefighters, the scene is a little messy so you should just stand to the side and watch. Don't cause trouble.\"She brought Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que into the company building. Because the elevator exits to the 17th and 18th floors were completely blocked off for the rescue operation, they were only able to ride a different elevator to the 16th floor, and then had to walk up two flights of stairs to reach the 18th floor.Only to see that the 18th floor elevator exit was, as expected, surrounded by Double Horn Technology's workers and firefighters. Someone who was probably the captain of the firefighting squadron and the person in charge of maintenance at the Double Horn Building were discussing a plan of action for the rescue. The two's faces and ears were red from arguing; it seemed they were about to start fighting.The remaining individuals were leaning against the elevator door, simultaneously knocking on the door and trying to speak with the people stuck inside.There were still others, likely company workers, walking to and fro, anxiety painted obviously on their faces.\"My G.o.d, that's our big boss.\" Zhang Qingqing pointed into the crowd at the middle-aged man wearing a restyled Chinese tunic suit and spoke quietly to Yu Zhengdu, \"I've been an intern for so long and only seen him on the company's website. I didn't imagine that even he would be disturbed this time.\"As she was speaking she started to explain for herself, \"But I guess it makes sense, they've been stuck for over an hour and among those inside are several of our collaborators. I heard that even now they haven't found out the cause, maintenance is saying that they do a regular check every month and also found no signs of an accident. It's really quite strange\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu looked at Shang Que, the expression in his eyes inquired what should we do?Shang Que once again failed to read the message in his eyes, and asked, \"What?\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026What should we do?\"Zhang Qingqing turned to look at him after hearing his question, saying placatingly, \"Don't worry, they're only temporarily stuck. Guangzong will definitely be fine!\"Yu Zhengdu calmly nodded. \"Yes, I'm sure Guangzong will be able to tough it out.\"At this time, he felt his hand being grabbed.He looked down and saw Shang Que holding onto his hand, their palms glued together. Shang Que softly said, \"Do you want to try?\"\"What?\" Yu Zhengdu asked him in confusion. At the same moment, a strange flow of warmth travelled between their connected hands into his own palm.Yu Zhengdu thought to himself, Boss is still quite supernatural after all.Their palms only touched for a short time, Shang Que let go of him very quickly and stated, \"Go press for the elevator. The door will open.\"Yu Zhengdu looked at him with slight disbelief. \"Really?\"Shang Que only gazed back at him with a slight smile.Zhang Qingqing's ears immediately stood up. After hearing their conversation, she made to tug at Yu Zhengdu. \"Wait, I already said to just stand to the side and watch. Don't randomly intervene\u2026\u2026\"But she ultimately didn't make it in time; Yu Zhengdu had already taken a step forward. Shang Que turned to look at her before laughing softly and following.Zhang Qingqing was so angry she stomped her feet. \"How can you two be like this, even though you're anxious you still have to listen to the professionals, otherwise aren't you just being reckless?\"At the same time, the firefighters and workers discovered Yu Zhengdu. A firefighter grabbed him: \"Student, it's dangerous here, please go somewhere else and don't come too close.\"Yu Zhengdu said, \"It doesn't look like there's anything wrong with the elevator, just let me press it once.\"The firefighter became slightly angry. \"We are in the middle of the rescue process, please do not cause trouble.\"Their argument drew the attention of others. The middle-aged man in the Chinese tunic suit, who was the company's boss according to Zhang Qingqing, furrowed his brows. \"What's wrong?\"The firefighter turned to respond to him, \"What's up with your company? We already said that this area has to be blocked off, how come there are still so many random people b.u.t.ting in here\u2026\u2026\"He didn't get to finish speaking as another worker suddenly shouted, \"What are you trying to do!?\"The firefighter turned his head, only to see that while he had been distracted, Yu Zhengdu had taken a lunge forward to arrive next to the elevator.The furious firefighter rushed over to push him, but suddenly felt his shoulders mysteriously freeze. He could not move an inch, so turned his head back to look, and saw a young man who was somehow both handsome and beautiful gazing at him with a smile that was not really a smile.He suddenly felt a sense of uncertainty, and just this moment of hesitation was enough for Yu Zhengdu to quickly press the up b.u.t.ton for the elevator.Everyone at the scene simultaneously inhaled loudly. Chinese tunic suit bellowed, \"Who is this person, why haven't you taken him away yet!\"Before the last echoes of his exclamation could reach each person's ears, everyone saw the elevator, which after much troubleshooting had still maintained its mysterious problem, and for so long had not responded, suddenly start running again with a \"ding\".Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even Zhang Qingqing, who was hiding off to the side, was stunned.Yu Zhengdu looked at his magical right hand, pleased. He muttered to himself, \"As expected from being enlightened.\"The confused crowd had no time to figure out the situation, as the elevator had already reached the 18th floor. The doors slowly opened and a group of people who had been trapped for ages finally saw the light again. They screamed in exasperation as they pushed their way out.\"We're out, we're finally out\u2026\u2026\"\"That scared me to death, I almost cried!\"\"\"Wuwuwu\", my makeup is ruined from how stuffy it was.\"\"This elevator is really so weird, one moment it was cold and another it was hot. I was simultaneously sweating and sneezing\u2026\u2026\"The firefighters hurried to put the tools left outside back while the maintenance workers were busy trying to restore order, frightened that pus.h.i.+ng or stampeding might accidentally occur.The firefighter squadron leader and the head of maintenance, both with red faces, paused in the middle of their argument to stare at each other. The squadron leader's mouth twitched. \"What's wrong with your elevator?\"The head of maintenance had on an expression of confusion. \"I don't know either, you guys couldn't open it earlier too, right?\"The leader thought about it and realized he was right. The two continued to silently stare at one another, suddenly forgetting what they were supposed to say.Those in the elevator managed to safely exit under the direction of the workers, although all of them were sweaty and no longer looked put together due to the stuffy environment inside. Many of the females' makeup had come off while the males' hair became tousled and their outfits messy.After everyone evacuated, the maintenance department declared that the elevator would be closed for repairs for the rest of the day.But strangely, the elevator that had clearly just started functioning normally again now couldn't close its doors.The head of maintenance was really going crazy. If the big boss weren't here, he would very likely have started tugging the worker's ear. \"What's wrong with this elevator? It's either that the doors can't open or they can't close?\"The maintenance worker was very innocent too. \"We checked it already, there's really nothing wrong.\"The head of maintenance scolded: \"You're saying nothing's wrong, if nothing's wrong then why isn't the door closing?\"Yu Zhengdu looked at the head of maintenance and his workers in pity, and then looked at the scene inside the elevator. His entire being: \"\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\"Only to see that now that the elevator was empty of living people, a group of ghosts emanating cyan and white puffs of air were holding their heads and squatting as they faced the wall. Their b.u.t.ts were in the way of the elevator exit, causing the door to become stuck.Each of these ghosts were quivering in fear. If you listened closely, you could almost hear the sound of their sniffling. Among them, one person spoke with a shaky voice, \"B-Boss Shang, we, we know we were wrong. Sir please, please, please don't, don't eat us!\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\"Seems like the legend of the Ghost King eating ghosts wasn't only known by the few at the company, but deeply influenced the entire Underworld too.Yu Zhengdu turned his head to look at Shang Que, but saw that he only casually glanced at those ghosts. He neither spoke nor displayed any expression on his face.Seeing as this was Yu Zhengdu's first time out on an excursion with the Boss, he didn't have much experience and wasn't sure what he was supposed to do in this situation. He pondered for a moment and when n.o.body else was paying attention, quietly told the ghosts, \"You guys come out first. Don't get in the way of them fixing the elevator.\"Those ghosts didn't dare to disobey. Upon hearing his words, they stood up one by one and walked out in a line, automatically standing against the wall with their heads down.Yu Zhengdu was very pleased. \"Quite organized.\"Shang Que's tone of voice was light. \"When they were alive who knows how many times they were arrested, of course they have a lot of experience.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\"As the group of ghosts left the elevator, the door slowly closed behind them.The head of maintenance had just finished yelling at his subordinates and was just about to personally offer an explanation to Chinese tunic suit when the elevator door slowly closed in front of everybody's eyes.The elevator was working; everything was normal.The head of maintenance: \"\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026???\"He looked at Chinese tunic suit and gulped. \"Boss, I will diligently inspect this. The same situation will not happen again.\"Chinese tunic suit only nonchalantly hummed, however his eyes were glued in Yu Zhengdu's direction. Perhaps the others had not noticed, but ever since that young man had pressed for the elevator, he had kept his attention on him. He clearly saw that the elevator door only closed after the young man softly said something.He gently rubbed one of his fingers, face displaying a look of contemplation.At this moment, the entire administration department of Double Horn Technology arrived and began receiving and comforting those who had just been rescued from the elevator. Among them, one group of people were given extra attention. This was exactly the visiting group of workers from Nova Technology that Hou Guangzong was a part of.The leader of Nova Technology's group was Hou Guangzong's supervisor, named Zhou Ke. The person in charge of receiving them at Double Horn Technology was Manager Chen. To show his sincerity, Manager Chen personally went downstairs to greet them, but didn't think that he would just so coincidentally get stuck in the elevator with them too.Manager Chen was of certain importance in the company. He felt that he had lost face in front of his customers, so was currently taking his anger out on the administration.The hairdo that Hou Guangzong had used half a \"catty\" of hair gel to style was ruined from the incident. He was extremely displeased as well, but being only an intern, he couldn't express his annoyance. He could only stay in the back and watch Manager Chen and Zhou Ke rant.But seeing the administration department's respectful and sincere att.i.tude, he could tell that Nova was viewed quite highly, and thus was a bit smug.Off in the distance, Zhang Qingqing recovered her wits. After much difficulty, she finally found Hou Guangzong in the crowd and quickly lunged forward, calling out: \"Guangzong, you are okay right.\"Hou Guangzong suddenly saw her and was quite surprised. \"Qingqing, how come you're here too?\"Zhang Qingqing said, \"Zhengdu heard that you were stuck in the elevator so specially rushed over to see you. I was the one who brought him in.\"Hou Guangzong's expression instantly became very strange. \"Yu Zhengdu? Came to see me?\"Zhang Qingqing nodded and praised their friends.h.i.+p. \"Yeah, he's really very loyal. In the middle of work, and he specially came over. You're really touched, right?\"Hou Guangzong's mood was already quite agitated from being stuck for such a long time, so he couldn't stop himself from saying, \"Is he crazy? Did he come just to see me make a fool of myself?\"Zhang Qingqing furrowed her brows. \"How could you say that?\"Hou Guangzong scoffed. \"It must have been so difficult for him, he must have been so happy hearing that I was stuck in the elevator, even hurrying over. It's probably because he has nothing to do in that trashy company and was bored.\"Zhang Qingqing was a little cross, and said, \"Guangzong, your words are too much. And to think that Zhengdu cares so much for you.\"Hou Guangzong was so close to rolling his eyes. \"He cares for me? You should ask him, are we close enough for that?\"\"So we aren't that close after all.\" Yu Zhengdu's voice suddenly rang out, accompanied with a sigh, \"I saw how often you worried about my situation in the group chat recently, and you were fretting over my job too. I thought you cared a lot about me.\"Zhang Qingqing angrily criticized the enemy. \"Right! You are too much!\"Hou Guangzong: \"\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\"Hou Guangzong didn't think that Yu Zhengdu would use his messages in the group chat against him, but to his frustration he couldn't come up with even half a sentence in retaliation. His face quickly became green from his pent-up emotions.They were ultimately all cla.s.smates. Zhang Qingqing thought it would be bad for the situation to continue down this track, so she played mediator for them. \"Guangzong, today you really need to thank Zhengdu. If it weren't for him, you might still be stuck in the elevator for who knows how long.\"Hou Guangzong was so angry he laughed. His tone of voice was full of ridicule. \"What, did he fix the elevator? He switched from coding to repairs at his new company?\"As soon as he finished speaking, a middle-aged man in a Chinese tunic suit walked over and nodded at Yu Zhengdu. He held out his hand and said, \"Student, thank you very much for aiding us in opening the elevator door.\"Yu Zhengdu shook his hand, smiling slightly. \"You're welcome.\"Hou Guangzong: \"\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026???\"At this moment, Manager Chen, who had just been pulling rank with the administration department, charged over to bow to Chinese tunic suit. His tone was full of ingratiation as he spoke, \"Boss Wei is here ah, my head was not right after being in the elevator for so long, so I didn't see you at first.\"Chinese tunic suit nodded, looked at Manager Chen and the people from Hou Guangzong's company, politely stating, \"It's been rough for you guys. Later the administration department's workers will have a gift for each of you, as an apology for your hards.h.i.+ps.\"Hou Guangzong's supervisor Zhou Ke immediately began cozying up. \"It's nothing, it's nothing. I didn't think Boss Wei would get disturbed by this matter too.\"Hou Guangzong only realized, belatedly, that it was very likely this man in the Chinese tunic suit was Double Horn Technology's big boss, Wei Xiao.Wei Xiao and Zhou Ke were ultimately not on the same level. Zhou Ke and his team also had Manager Chen receiving them already, so Wei Xiao only entertained him briefly. After doing his part in comforting them, he once again turned to Yu Zhengdu. \"Student, thank goodness you were here. If you don't mind, let's speak inside.\"Yu Zhengdu was a bit baffled and said, \"Ah, it was nothing, no sweat at all. There isn't anything to talk about.\"\"I think being able to open the elevator isn't as 'no sweat' as you say.\" Wei Xiao's words hid a deeper meaning; his att.i.tude was sincere too, \"I definitely owe you a grat.i.tude fee.\"As soon as Yu Zhengdu heard the words \"grat.i.tude fee\", he swallowed the farewell that was already on the tip of his tongue and reached behind to grab Shang Que and push him forward. \"This is our boss, you can give the money to him.\"Hou Guangzong was originally very displeased at the amount of respect Wei Xiao was showing Yu Zhengdu, and upon witnessing Yu Zhengdu's actions, he couldn't keep the expression of distaste off his face. A small company is still a small company. They only see money, what a lack of composure.Even though Shang Que was being tugged around by Yu Zhengdu, the expression on his face was still very indifferent, as if he didn't care for these trivial matters. His posture was graceful as he said, \"We don't need money\u2026\u2026\"Before he finished speaking, Yu Zhengdu pinched his forearm and scooted in closer to chant under his breath, \"Development budget development budget development budget\u2026\u2026\"Even after being pinched, Shang Que's facial expression still remained unchanged. The angle of his smile was the same, too; the only difference was his change in speech. \"How much are you planning on giving?\"Wei Xiao didn't expect them to be from the same company, and was momentarily stunned. He looked at Shang Que and asked, \"May I ask what your company does?\"Yu Zhengdu straightened himself and said, \"We work in health management.\"He elbowed Shang Que. \"Boss, your business card.\"Upon hearing his words, Shang Que very cooperatively took his phone out from his pocket and opened his WeChat business card to hand over. He asked Wei Xiao, \"Do you want to scan me?\"Wei Xiao: \"\u2026\u2026\"Manager Chen and everyone from Nova Technology after seeing this scene in its entirety: \"\u2026\u2026\"Hou Guangzong scoffed, they are really so embarra.s.sing!Only to see Wei Xiao quietly retrieve his own phone and scan Shang Que's barcode. Not only this, he even took the initiative to ask Yu Zhengdu, \"Student, give me your WeChat to scan too.\"Hou Guangzong: \"\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026????\"Yay! Two chapters today cause it's my first day posting~ (But please don't expect this pace all the time QQ)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Please come in.\" Wei Xiao led Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que into the company's meeting room.After sitting down, Wei Xiao once again thanked them for being good Samaritans. Yu Zhengdu's response was very honest: \"There's no need to be so polite. Since we are collecting a grat.i.tude fee, we can't be considered good Samaritans.\"Shang Que maintained his nonchalant look, elegantly resting against the back of the chair. He nodded at Yu Zhengdu's words. \"Exactly.\"Wei Xiao paused for a moment, then looked at Yu Zhengdu. His words hid a deeper meaning as he asked, \"May I ask, how did you open the elevator?\"Yu Zhengdu originally wanted to use the lie he used with the firefighters to trick him too, and then leave after receiving the grat.i.tude fee. But after hearing this question, his breath hitched as he realized that perhaps Wei Xiao already noticed something.The company's secretly obviously couldn't be revealed, but if Wei Xiao really was suspicious, it probably would be difficult to fool him.Yu Zhengdu was a bit hesitant so looked at Shang Que, only to see Shang Que's head was propped up on one hand, his expression indifferent. His tone of voice was pa.s.sive. \"Say what you want to say directly. Stop going in circles.\"Yu Zhengdu immediately felt newfound respect. Even though their company was small, their boss's att.i.tude wasn't!He just didn't know if the big boss of a famous, old-fas.h.i.+oned company like Double Horn Technology would buy it.Yu Zhengdu secretly worried about the grat.i.tude fee that they hadn't received yet.Wei Xiao was ultimately someone who had a lot of experience in the business field, even after this he remained unbothered, warmly saying, \"I noticed it earlier. Not only did this student open the elevator doors, but later when the doors closed, you guys did that too right.\"Yu Zhengdu didn't think Wei Xiao would be so sensitive thus couldn't help feeling surprised, but outwardly he mimicked his boss perfectly, quietly faking an aloof air and remaining silent.Thankfully Wei Xiao didn't trouble them with more questions, suddenly changing the topic and saying, \"To tell you the truth, I have a daughter named Momo who is 5 this year. Her health has always been poor and she gets sick a lot. Her mother and I took her to many famous doctors but to no avail. Later her grandmother took her to see a religious man, who said that Momo's health problems weren't because of a congenital deficiency\u2026\u2026\"\"Sometimes Momo is like this student too, she'll talk to the air\u2026\u2026\"Wei Xiao made a call as he spoke, \"Xiao Ni, bring Momo over.\"Right after he finished his command, someone who appeared to be an a.s.sistant knocked on the door and entered. She nervously expressed, \"Boss W-Wei, Mo, Mo\u2026\u2026 Momo is gone\u2014\u2014\"Wei Xiao stood up with a \"huo\". His previous warm and courteous appearance disappeared, replaced with an expression of rage. He harshly asked, \"What did you say?\"The a.s.sistant's makeup was about to start running off her face from all the sweating; her voice shook as she spoke, \"Just now Momo was clamoring to see you. I couldn't stop her so took her by the elevator, but just, just then someone sent a file over so I grabbed it. It was just a moment but Momo, dis-disappeared\u2026\u2026\"Wei Xiao's face was dark. He glared at his a.s.sistant, \"Then hurry and get people to go look.\"His a.s.sistant's voice wavered like she was about to cry, \"We're already looking. I'm sure we'll find her soon.\"Wei Xiao's voice was as cold as ice as he slammed a hand against the table. \"How soon, give me a time.\"The a.s.sistant obviously couldn't give him a time. The entire company knew how much the big boss cared for his precious daughter, or he wouldn't bring her to the company so often. Yet the more it was so, the more the a.s.sistant feared. Her eyes glistened with tears, but she didn't dare to cry, only bracing herself and saying, \"Very, very soon\u2026\u2026\"Wei Xiao had already lost all of his previous composure and was currently walking in circles where he stood.Yu Zhengdu could approximately guess what happened from the conversation he heard, and couldn't help but worry for Wei Xiao. Unfortunately, he really couldn't do anything in this sort of situation.At this moment, Shang Que, who had previously only been an indifferent wallflower, suddenly opened his mouth, lightly asking, \"If I can help you find her, will I get another grat.i.tude fee?\"Wei Xiao forcefully turned his head to look at him.Yu Zhengdu stared at him in shock. He never imagined, Boss learned how to make money so quickly. He awkwardly said, \"Boss, can't we have a cla.s.sier way of earning money\u2026\u2026\"But Wei Xiao had already practically jumped on him: \"How much. However much you want, as long as you can help me find Momo.\"Yu Zhengdu quickly comforted him. \"Boss Wei, there's no need to be this way. It's every citizen's responsibility to help find lost children. We really don't need to discuss pay.\"Wei Xiao was firm. \"I will definitely pay for this.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\"Shang Que switched a hand to rest his head on, looked at him, and asked shamelessly, \"What is considered a cla.s.sy way of earning money?\"Yu Zhengdu: = = Can Boss focus his attention on the right things.The good thing was that he remembered his boss wasn't a human, and couldn't be judged by human standards, so he responded in a low voice, \"Boss, a lost child isn't a small issue. If you know how to find her, just hurry and tell Boss Wei.\"Shang Que looked at him and smiled. \"Didn't she disappear by the elevator? All we need to do is ask the bunch still over there.\"Yu Zhengdu was. .h.i.t by this sudden revelation.He led a distraught Wei Xiao to the elevator exit. The group of ghosts were still obediently lined up against the wall, not daring to interfere with the pa.s.sersby at all.As the situation was urgent, Yu Zhengdu had no time to worry about Wei Xiao's reaction. He directly inquired, \"Have you seen a 5 year old little girl?\"A ghost on the side stuck out a hand and pointed in the direction of the stairs, saying, \"She went over there.\"Yu Zhengdu nodded and told Wei Xiao, \"Boss Wei, this way.\"Wei Xiao was stunned and gaped as he watched Yu Zhengdu speak to the air and then confidently point in a direction. He remembered this also happened earlier, when Yu Zhengdu spoke to the empty elevator and the doors closed after.Wei Xiao was ultimately someone who had witnessed many things before, so though he was bewildered internally, he wasn't in a rush to ask questions. Instead, he followed Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que to the stairs. As he spoke, he shared his doubts. \"Is she really here? Momo once almost got lost here when she was playing hide and seek. Afterwards she developed a fear of the stairwell, so probably wouldn't come over herself\u2026\u2026\"He only got through his doubts halfway before quickly shutting up.Only to hear a little girl's laughter resounding in the echoey stairwell: \"Heh heh\u2014\u2014\"\"Lift your hand\u2014\u2014 lift your foot\u2014\u2014\"\"Walk forward\u2014\u2014\"\"Heh heh\u2014\u2014\"\"So fun\u2014\u2014\"\"Heh heh\u2014\u2014\"\"Heh heh\u2014\u2014\"The voice had the crispness and sweetness a little girl's should have, and should have been considered cute. But perhaps due to the elongated last syllables or the effects of the echoes, it sounded strangely empty and weightless in the deserted stairwell.There was a subtle and hard to explain creepiness to it.An unexplainable feeling of disgust hit Yu Zhengdu, but Wei Xiao was overjoyed. He followed the source of the sound and sprinted downstairs, yelling as he ran, \"Momo, where are you? Don't move, wait for dad to come\u2014\u2014\"Yu Zhengdu felt exasperated, but could only grab Shang Que and run downstairs with him.Five or six flights down, a human shadow suddenly flashed in front of their eyes. They stopped in their tracks.Only to see a short little girl standing at the corner of the staircase half a floor below them.The little girl had two pigtails, wore a red dress with shoulder straps, and her socks had lace borders. But in her hands, she held a marionette styled like a doll.The little girl's head was down, her entire focus on tugging at the strings of the marionette. She kept saying, \"Lift your hand\u2014\u2014 lift your foot\u2014\u2014\"\"So very fun\u2014\u2014 Heh heh\u2014\u2014\"Following her words, her hand and foot would move.She raised a hand, then a foot.The marionette raised hand, then a foot, too.The lighting was dim in the stairwell. The little girl's shadow was blurry against the wall, attached to the smaller marionette's. The big and small shadows were in sync.\"Lift your hand\u2014\u2014 lift your foot\u2014\u2014\"\"Really fun\u2014\u2014\"Wei Xiao finally found his daughter, and immediately yelled, \"Momo\u2014\u2014\"After, he made to run over to her, but was stopped by Shang Que.Wei Xiao looked at Shang Que with bewilderment. His voice was anxious. \"Mr. Shang, she is my daughter.\"Shang Que didn't speak, only looking indifferently in the little girl's direction.At this time the little girl finally lifted her face; both corners of her mouth raised, emerging in a slight smile. Her crisp voice also seemed hollow. \"Dad\u2014\u2014\"She lifted her hand. \"Look, lift your hand\u2014\u2014\"The marionette's hand lifted too.She lifted her foot. \"Look, lift your foot\u2014\u2014\"The marionette's foot lifted too.Wei Xiao replied urgently, \"Momo, dad sees it.\"In the same instant, Yu Zhengdu's head rang with a \"weng\". The unexplainable feeling of disgust became physical chills running down his body.He clearly saw that as the little girl smiled, the marionette, which was supposed to be expressionless, also displayed a creepy smile.He subconsciously reached out to stop Wei Xiao, saying, \"Boss Wei, don't go over yet. Right now it's not your daughter playing with the marionette\u2026\u2026\"The expression on Wei Xiao's face immediately changed. Finally, he too realized something was off, and asked, \"What do you mean?\"Only to hear Shang Que lightly say, \"Un, it's the marionette playing with your daughter.\"Wei Xiao blanked. He looked at Wei Mo shaking her head left and right, her two little pigtails swaying with the motion. She said, \"Dad, come over here. Play with me.\"She lifted her hand and then her foot.The marionette followed in lifting its hand and foot.\"Look, it's so fun.\"But Wei Xiao was staring at the wall behind her in disbelief. From the shadows, one could clearly tell that it was the marionette first lifting its hand, using the strings to puppet his daughter.Lifting her hand, then her foot.Wei Xiao looked simultaneously ill and furious. He was such a big boss, yet had no words to describe the situation, only blankly turning to stare at Shang Que and Yu Zhengdu.This was also Yu Zhengdu's first time witnessing such a scene. Gooseb.u.mps popped up all over his body and he hid behind Boss, saying, \"f.u.c.k, what kind of ghost is that? It's so scary.\"Shang Que: \"A serving ghost that has been refined.\"Yu Zhengdu was still unclear about ghost cla.s.sifications, so was confused by his words. He asked, \"Is it aggressive?\"Shang Que thought about it and said, \"Compared to other ghosts, it is considered quite aggressive.\"A so-called serving ghost was one that had been refined or contained by those who had learned Daoist practices. The ghosts were kept under their command and had to serve them; this Daoist skill was known as the Serving Ghost Technique. However, the ghosts that could be contained were those that tended to be more aggressive than regular ghosts. After refinery, their abilities would become greater, making them even more aggressive. Without true prowess, it would be fairly difficult to get the upper hand with them.After hearing the explanation, Yu Zhengdu immediately became even more worried. He felt his own breathing become quicker, so stubbornly stayed behind Boss's back, refusing to even stick his head out. At most he only raised a hand to ma.s.sage his boss's shoulders. \"Jiayou, it's all on you!\"Wei Xiao finally found some of his voice again, eyes beseeching as he looked at Shang Que. \"Mr. Shang, as long as you can save my daughter, I'll give you as much money as you want.\"Yu Zhengdu solemnly stated, \"Boss Wei, don't worry. We refuse to make our fortune off children.\"Wei Xiao answered sullenly, \"I don't mind if you do\u2026\u2026\"While one of them was adamant about not receiving money and the other was adamant about giving money, Shang Que had already walked over. His figure was tall and lean, his footsteps steady as he calmly made his way over to Wei Mo.Yu Zhengdu was agitated in his stead, and said, \"Boss, at crucial moments you should just let go of your image. Capturing ghosts is more important.\"As soon as he finished speaking, he saw Shang Que grab the marionette from Wei Mo's hand and directly toss it on the ground, then stomp on it with his foot. The marionette's screech of agony was extra terrifying in the empty stairwell.Shang Que turned around. \"Done.\"Yu Zhengdu and Wei Xiao both remained silent.Yu Zhengdu asked expressionlessly, \"Boss, didn't you say this ghost was very aggressive?\"Shang Que looked at him with a smile that was not really a smile. \"In the humans' cla.s.sification, it is quite aggressive.\"As for its ranking among the Underworld's cla.s.sification, especially in front of the Ghost King, then obviously things would be different.Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026Oh.\"Only because Boss is too handsome, causing people to often forget his true ident.i.ty.Even though Wei Xiao was still a little frightened of the marionette, he had no time to display his fear, instead running over immediately to pick up his daughter and comfort her.Yu Zhengdu squatted on the ground to look at the marionette, criticizing, \"Not even letting a child off, what a piece of s.h.i.+t!\"Shang Que asked, \"Do you want to play with the marionette?\"Yu Zhengdu glanced at him, the excitement in his eyes obvious, \"Is it dangerous?\"\"No,\" Shang Que answered, removing his foot in the process.Thus Yu Zhengdu hoisted the marionette up and started thras.h.i.+ng it against the wall, almost like he was pulling noodles. \"Lifting your hands and feet, lift my a.s.s!\"After scolding it for a few moments wasn't enough, he started tugging wildly at the marionette's head. \"Still think it's so fun!\"Not much later, the marionette finally couldn't hold it anymore. It moaned and groaned, \"I won't do it again, I won't do it again, please don't twist my head.\"Its voice was like sandpaper, gravelly and rough. The echoes in the empty staircase made it seem even more horrifying.But Yu Zhengdu's emotions didn't fluctuate. He continued to squeeze the marionette's neck and scolded, \"You've got guts, evil ghost! How dare you come out in the middle of the day to harm people!\"The marionette's voice was weak and plaintive, \"I, I didn't. I just wanted to have a little fun, not harm anyone!\"Yu Zhengdu was furious. He pointed at the girl in Wei Xiao's arms and said, \"You dare to lie when the witness is right here!\"The marionette's entire being was not okay. He shook like a leaf in Yu Zhengdu's hand. \"I've been wronged. I was originally a serving ghost controlled by humans and finally escaped. I was scared that I would get caught and taken back, so could only hide in these unoccupied corners. I happened to see this little girl suddenly run in; I saw that her 7 mortal forms were unstable. I've spent too long being controlled by humans, so I couldn't help but want to try the feeling of controlling a human instead and possessed her puppet to play for a bit. I was just lonely and bored, I really didn't mean any harm\u2026\u2026\"As the marionette spoke it also shook wildly. If not for Yu Zhengdu holding on, it probably would have tried to kneel right then and there.Yu Zhengdu saw that the ghost seemed honest, so turned to look at Shang Que with a look half believing and half disbelieving.Shang Que maintained his apathetic appearance. Upon noticing Yu Zhengdu's gaze, he finally slowly responded, \"The child is fine. She probably ran into that group of ghosts by the elevator so her soul is a little unstable, which is how she ended up here.\"The marionette felt extremely wronged, and almost shouted for Justice Bao. It cried, \"That's what happened. I'm really a good ghost, I'm innocent.\"Yu Zhengdu imitated the tone of voice that Kang Jin and the others normally used, declaring rather professionally, \"No matter what kind of ghost you are, you can't walk around freely outside, especially since you also made a mistake. Even though it isn't severe enough to be considered a crime, you'll still need to be detained for a few days.\"After speaking, Yu Zhengdu looked at Wei Xiao and said, \"Boss Wei, I don't think you should keep this marionette. How about giving it to us.\"After witnessing the entire process Wei Xiao was now expressionless. He placed a hand over his chest and said, \"You take it, take it. No need to be polite.\"He already started using honorifics.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWei Xiao placed all his focus on his career when he was younger, so didn't have his daughter until much later. Thus, he and his wife adored their precious daughter even more. But just so it happened, their baby daughter had poor health from an early age. Even after seeing many famous doctors, it did not get better. If she were only weak it would be manageable, but as his daughter eventually grew up and gained self awareness, he slowly realized that she would occasionally blank out or become dazed. Sometimes, this lasted over several days, and even the doctors couldn't give any reasons either.Wei Xiao was your cla.s.sic STEM student; at first he didn't even consider any unscientific causes. It wasn't until the kid's grandmother thought about it some more and inquired a religious man that Wei Xiao and his wife realized their daughter's health problems possibly were greater than the typical weak immune system.According to the religious man, Wei Mo's problem was a natural deficiency and light eight characters, making it easy for her to b.u.mp into creatures of the Underworld. Temporarily losing her soul was nothing. The biggest worry was that one day she would run into a true demon, one difficult to get rid of, and her life would be in danger.In the beginning, Wei Xiao still had his doubts, but after the kid's grandmother brought back some anti-evil and protection items from the religious man, Wei Mo's symptoms became a lot better. She even temporarily lost her soul less often, so he had no choice but to believe what the religious man said. But at the same time, he was even more distraught, because the religious man very clearly stated that the most important cause was Wei Mo's eight characters. He could help relieve disasters and prevent evil, but could not solve the problem from its root. The religious man was getting old too, thus evidently could not protect Wei Mo for her whole life.The events that happened today had Wei Xiao in a cold sweat. Even though he understood his daughter's condition, the most severe thing that had happened previously was Wei Mo \"losing\" her soul for a couple of days. It was his first time witnessing this current situation of actually running into a ghost. Of course, Shang Que's method of catching ghosts without abandon left an unforgettable impression on him.He was even more polite as he led Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que back to the meeting room. The bright light in the meeting room allowed the terror and stifling feelings in his heart to slightly dissipate.Wei Xiao exhaled, and, without even thinking about it, took out his checkbook and scribbled a line of 0's, then handed it to Shang Que. \"Mr. Shang, this is the grat.i.tude fee for today.\"Shang Que crossed one leg over the other and glanced at Yu Zhengdu from the corner of his eye. He raised his chin in a haughty, bossy manner and said, \"Get the money.\"As expected from someone who overly cares about their image\u2026\u2026Yu Zhengdu peeked at Boss. He didn't have as many issues as his boss, so simply picked up the check and looked. After seeing the five 0's in the number, he suddenly became excited. At least he wouldn't have to worry about his annual wage as per their contract anymore. But after feeling excited for a bit, he started to hesitate.Shang Que saw his dilemma and remembered what he said in the stairwell. He lowered his eyes and told Wei Xiao, \"We aren't accepting money for the situation with the child. You don't need to give this much.\"Yu Zhengdu looked at his boss in surprise. He never expected that an Underworld capitalist would have so much awareness.\"I do, it's necessary.\" Wei Xiao was very stubborn. He paused for a moment and then finally shared his true purpose, \"Actually, I have something else I need to ask of you two\u2026\u2026\"When Hou Guangzong left the Double Horn building with Zhou Ke and the others, he finally exhaled out the dissatisfaction that had been trapped in his chest since morning. He could barely hide his pride as he took out his phone and updated his status.\u3010Hou Guangzong: First time in collaboration talks and got sent to an old company like Ox Factory; the other party was even their project manager. I was so nervous, but thankfully Director \"Cho\" was there to help. As expected, we successfully completed our a.s.signment in the end.\u3011The one hour he spent distraught and stuck in the elevator hadn't been publicized, so as soon as he updated his status, he immediately received several likes. The comments were filled with praise. No one wasn't jealous that he got such fulfilling opportunity as an intern, especially since he got to interact with the executives of a large company. In comparison to a lot of students who were still doing legwork, his experience was something to only be dreamed about.Hou Guangzong was even more pleased. Even the annoyance from Yu Zhengdu's appearance vanished. He followed behind Zhou Ke and replied to comments as he got in the car, only to see an abundance of notifications from the cla.s.s's group chat.Zhang Qingqing:\u3010Oh my goodness, guess what I just saw!\u3011Zhu Yan:\u3010Don't keep us hanging, hurry and spill\u3011Zhang Qingqing:\u3010Zhengdu just reached a collaboration with our company. Our big boss personally met with him\u3011Cla.s.smate A:\u3010Really?\u3011Cla.s.smate B:\u3010Surprised.jpg\u3011Cla.s.smate C:\u3010Pics or it didn't happen\u3011Zhang Qingqing:\u3010Honestly if I didn't see it with my own two eyes I wouldn't believe it either, but it just so happened that I (actually it was on purpose) pa.s.sed by the boss's office door and saw this scene\u2026\u2026\u3011Zhang Qingqing:\u3010Picture.jpg\u3011In the picture Zhang Qingqing uploaded, someone who was clearly Yu Zhengdu and a middle-aged man were both in frame. The middle-aged man had the aura of a successful person, and was politely shaking Yu Zhengdu's hand.Zhang Qingqing:\u3010I'll get to the important part. This is our big boss; I just saw him walk Zhengdu to the door, and overheard him telling Zhengdu something along the lines of \"Money isn't an issue. I'll go visit your company another day. If possible, I hope we can be collaborators for a long time\"\u3011Cla.s.smate A:\u3010Is this for real? Didn't you say before that it was really hard to see your big boss personally?\u3011Zhang Qingqing:\u3010That's what my seniors at the company told me. They all said that the big boss drowns himself in technology and doesn't really personally meet with clients much anymore, unless they're a technician with top-notch skills\u2026\u2026\u3011Zhu Yan:\u3010Wait! A technician with top-notch skills!\u3011Zhu Yan:\u3010Watson, I think I may be getting it\u3011Cla.s.smate B:\u3010Getting it, I think I've got it too!\u3011Cla.s.smate C:\u3010Each student in our cla.s.s is more impressive than the next. Is this really your big boss?\u3011Zhang Qingqing:\u3010It really is. Guangzong saw him too when he came to our company today. @Hou GuangZong, right?\u3011Cla.s.smate A:\u3010Oh right, and Guangzong just posted a status update of pictures with your executives\u3011Zhang Qingqing:\u3010Not even. Guangzong got stuck in the elevator. If not for Zhengdu's help, he would still be trapped inside, \"hehe.\"\u3011Hou Guangzong: \u2026\u2026Hou Guangzong looked at all the cla.s.smates in the group chat who kept @'ing him to step up as a witness and Zhang Qingqing's meaningful \"hehe\". He was so p.i.s.sed he almost deleted his status update.Of course, quite a few people in the group chat @'d Yu Zhengdu to come claim the picture, but Yu Zhengdu didn't even look at his phone, so naturally couldn't respond to these messages.What Zhang Qingqing said in the group about him and Wei Xiao reaching a collaboration was true, but of course, the topic of collaboration was just very different from what everyone was imagining.Because of his daughter Wei Mo's situation, Wei Xiao was asking for help from Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que. Yu Zhengdu took the chance to sell him their company's product, a \"health magnet\". It was the same as the one he had gifted Li Tiantian before. Technically it was nothing more than a normal pebble, but it was stamped with Luofeng's company seal, which, according to Shang Que, was h.e.l.l's official logo. If Wei Mo carried this stone that was recognized by h.e.l.l, normal demons and evil spirits would not dare to come close to her.Wei Xiao really knew nothing about this health management company that was starting to seem more and more like a fake, but he had witnessed Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que's abilities before. Not only did he buy the \"health magnet\" without hesitation, he also tried to set up a prolonged collaboration. Evidently, a simple stone was not enough for him to stop worrying over his daughter's condition.After leaving Double Horn Technology, Yu Zhengdu didn't manage to catch a break. He and Shang Que still had unfinished business for this trip, and it was important business. While the cla.s.s group chat was furiously gossiping about him, he and his boss had grabbed the group of runaway ghosts and were heading to Fu City's Ancient Well reincarnation point.During this period he had started to understand a bit of how the company worked. As the new age h.e.l.l, Luofeng didn't own an entire world like it did in the past with the Underworld. Instead, it could only work in the mortal realm. Even the headquarters, Luofeng Management, were pitifully housed in the small office area of a technology park. Evidently, they had to simplify the reincarnation process as best as they could. At the moment, Luofeng had opened reincarnation points in all major cities in the country, doing their best to localize and simplify ghost reincarnation.Fu City's Ancient Well reincarnation point was the main reincarnation pa.s.sageway for Fu City and its surrounding cities.Fu City was one with a long history. Even though it had always placed an emphasis on the economy, the Old City district was still home to several places of interest. The former site of the Three Chambers of Commerce, located in the middle of the city at the Ancient Well district, was one of them.In the beginning, the Three Chambers of Commerce was a partners.h.i.+p formed between merchants from three different provinces. These three groups of people pooled their funds and built an a.s.sembly hall that covered an enormous amount of s.p.a.ce. Later on, times changed and the partners.h.i.+p ended, but the a.s.sembly hall was preserved because of its unique architecture. Even now, it remained a local attraction.Aside from being a piece of architecture worthy of discussion, the most distinctive part of the Three Chambers' a.s.sembly Hall was the well inside the hall.According to legend, the a.s.sembly hall was supposed to have 88 rooms, but something went wrong in the design. When they counted after construction was completed, they discovered there were only 87 rooms; the merchants from the three different provinces were furious at this. Luckily, among the craftsmen, there was an eccentric genius who proposed an idea. It turned out that the a.s.sembly hall had originally dug a well, but because of its geographic location, there was no water in the well, so they had planned to fill it in. The man suggested they tweak the design of the well and turn it into the 88th room.Because of this wild idea, the ancient well became somewhat of a local legend. Later, when they were dividing the city into districts, they even named the district after the ancient well.And the current Fu City's Ancient Well reincarnation point was set exactly in the 88th room of the Three Chambers' a.s.sembly Hall\u2014\u2014the ancient well\u3002It was a pity; though Yu Zhengdu had studied in Fu City for four years, he had never come to visit the Three Chambers' a.s.sembly Hall before. He had never imagined that his first time visiting would be under these circ.u.mstances.Yu Zhengdu didn't realize that you needed a ticket to enter the Three Chambers' a.s.sembly Hall until he was already standing in front of the entrance.He and Shang Que stood there, staring at each other. Yu Zhengdu was a bit exasperated. \"Boss, our company is already so poor. How come you chose to set our work location in a place that requires tickets.\"Shang Que momentarily remained silent too, before saying, \"Normally if we need to enter, we wouldn't need to pay.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\" He almost forgot again, this company only had one human, him.He calmly pulled out his student ID and handed it to the cas.h.i.+er. \"One student ticket, thank you.\"The cas.h.i.+er smiled at the two handsome men, enthusiastically asking Shang Que, \"Where's your student ID?\"Yu Zhengdu's heart hurt as he thought about the company's lack of finances. \"His ticket is full price.\"The two had just entered the a.s.sembly hall when a man wearing a small vest floated out of a room and rushed over to greet them.Small vest was called Zhen Yi. He was the one in charge of the Ancient Well reincarnation point. Yu Zhengdu only now found out that their company had employees stationed at each reincarnation point. It seemed that the size of the company was a little larger than he originally thought.As soon as Zhen Yi saw the line of escaped ghosts behind them, his heart settled and he immediately led Shang Que and Yu Zhengdu in the direction of the ancient well.Every time Yu Zhengdu thought about the fact that he was almost going to witness the legendary process of samsara, he became uncontrollably excited and couldn't help but ask Zhen Yi, \"What's the reincarnation point like? Is it like in the books, with a reincarnation platform and all that?\"Zhen Yi thought about it and said, \"Well from its abilities, it's about the same as the reincarnation platform.\"Yu Zhengdu's entire being was bursting with excitement. During this period he had read a lot of material on the Underworld and h.e.l.l. Each book had written plenty on the six paths of reincarnation, but when it came to the actual process of reincarnating, they all had different things to say.He didn't imagine that he would get the opportunity to be the first living human to personally witness the truth of samsara so soon.In Yu Zhengdu's imagination, the cycle of samsara, which determined every living beings' current and future lives, should be a large and magnificent process with lots of bright lights involved. It should allow one to see visions they wouldn't normally have. At worst, it should at least be similar to TV dramas: a huge opening appearing in the middle of a void, as if it could swallow all ghosts and spirits alike.Yu Zhengdu and his head full of overflowing fantasies followed Zhen Yi through a small door, and then paused as his entire being was. .h.i.t with shock.Outside the little door was a vast s.p.a.ce; the famed ancient well was located in the corner of this s.p.a.ce.But what shocked him was the sight in front of him.The Three Chambers' a.s.sembly Hall was not a popular attraction, and it was neither a holiday nor a weekend, so there were few tourists in the hall itself. Only the area surrounding the ancient well displayed a completely different and surprising scene in Yu Zhengdu's eyes.He saw that the s.p.a.ce was organized similar to the lobby of a \"certification\" office, with rows and rows of chairs. Upon taking a closer look, he even noticed that some of the chairs were different from those of the mortal world, almost as if they were made of paper.The chairs were filled with ghosts. There weren't enough seats for all of them, so some were standing around the chairs. The entire area was full of clamor and filled to the brim.The chairs were all facing the ancient well. Above the ancient well, an enormous digital screen floated, displaying how many lines were up ahead. Different numbers were linked to different lines on the screen, and each group of numbers was constantly changing. As soon as the number changed, a ghost would bid their farewells to those around them and step into the well.All around the ancient well, uniformed ghosts were maintaining order.When Yu Zhengdu arrived, he was just in time to see one of the numbers on the screen pause on the number \"1198\". Moments later, a broadcast started. The voice was that of a friendly and sweet female, \"Can client number 1198 please head over to the fourth pa.s.sageway now to reincarnate.\"\"Can client number 1198 please head over to the fourth pa.s.sageway now to reincarnate.\"\"Can client number 1198 please head over to the fourth pa.s.sageway now to reincarnate.\"After broadcasting three times, still n.o.body showed up at that pa.s.sageway. The number moved on and the female voice continued, \"Can client number 1199 please head over to the fourth pa.s.sageway now to reincarnate.\"Yu Zhengdu: = =At this moment, an urgent voice shouted from behind him, \"Excuse me, excuse me, I'm in a rush to reincarnate!\"Soon after, he felt a sudden chill run down his body, only to see that a ghost had just run through him, charging towards the ancient well. It yelled, \"Wait a moment, I'm number 1198. I was just at home grabbing some sacrificial goods, I didn't mean to be late\u2014\u2014\"Zhen Yi reached a hand out to catch the ghost by the collar of his s.h.i.+rt and said, \"They pa.s.sed your number. You'll be postponed three numbers before you can reincarnate.\"The ghost was holding a big bag of candles in the shape of \"yuanbaos\" in his arms. Upon hearing this he burst into tears with a \"wah\" and sat on the ground to cry. \"I don't want that. My reincarnation time was really good\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu rolled his eyes at Zhen Yi.About the same as the reincarnation platform my a.s.s.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayShang Que's arrival, along with the crowd following him, caused a stir in the certification office.Many of the ghosts present had never seen the legendary boss of Luofeng Management. When the Ghost King deliberately hid his aura, he just seemed like a rather good-looking normal ghost.But they recognized the line of ghosts behind him. Weren't these the ones that caused a commotion in the morning about not wanting to reincarnate? Didn't expect them to get caught and brought back so soon.\"You all go over there. Hold your heads and squat. Stay squatting.\" Zhen Yi pointed to a stop by the wall as he screamed like a demon at the ghosts behind Yu Zhengdu.All the ghosts had dejected expressions. They obediently moved next to the wall and squatted. The scene seemed a bit bleak.Yu Zhengdu could faintly hear the other ghosts' discussions coming from the direction of the reincarnation hall.\"f.u.c.k, good thing I wasn't persuaded to escape this morning, otherwise I would be squatting there too now.\"\"Everyone already knows the truth, so stop pretending. You didn't follow him and run because your reincarnation is going to have a good life\u2026\u2026\"\"Heh heh, I've been exposed. This life I spent half my life trying to pay back the mortgage on my house. In my next life I'll finally be able to reincarnate into a family with a house inheritance. It hasn't been easy.\"\"Ey, I don't have it so nice. My family in my next life can only help me make the down payment for a house\u2026\u2026\"\"Can you two stop showing off? In my next life I'll still be a brick mover, s.h.i.+t!\"Yu Zhengdu was confused by their conversation. Meanwhile, Zhen Yi had already brought two chairs over, and told him and Shang Que, \"Please sit.\"Yu Zhengdu was just about to sit when Shang Que suddenly forcefully grabbed his arm.Yu Zhengdu looked at him, bewildered: \"?\"Shang Que's eyes travelled down, signalling for him to look at the chair.Only to see Yu Zhengdu's b.u.t.t had already pa.s.sed through the chair and was floating in the air.Yu Zhengdu's heart skipped a beat. \"\u2026\u2026What kind of chair is this?\"Upon seeing this Zhen Yi slapped his own forehead. \"Ey, look at me. You're our living human coworker from headquarters right. These paper chairs were ma.s.s-ordered by headquarters and then \"burned\" over. Living people can't use them.\"This wasn't Yu Zhengdu's first time getting surprised. He calmly stood up, patted his arm, and said, \"No worries. I'll just stand.\"Shang Que smiled and lifted a hand to stroke his forehead, then stated, \"It's okay now.\"Yu Zhengdu felt a cold sensation in his forehead. He looked at Shang Que with a perplexed expression. Shang Que stared pointedly at the chair. \"Try and sit.\"Yu Zhengdu was still suspicious as he felt the chair, only to find he really could physically feel it. He couldn't help his excited cheer: \"I have finally experienced what it's like to be a ghost.\"Zhen Yi: = = What's there to experience.Shang Que said with a smile, \"Employee benefits.\"The two sat, and Zhen Yi started to question the ghosts. He first called over the leader of the escaped ghosts. \"Hong Gentou, come out.\"A slightly chubby middle-aged man stood up. Yu Zhengdu glanced at him and felt surprised. This man had a square face and big ears; he seemed honest. His eyes shook with fear. He was the type of person that would go unnoticed in a crowd. It was hard to tell that he was an escaped convict.Zhen Yi asked sternly, \"Why did you escape?\"Hong Gentou squeezed his shoulders together and stammered out, \"I, I don't want to reincarnate\u2026\u2026\"Zhen Yi: \"Why don't you want to reincarnate?\"Hong Gentou's eyes flashed and his voice was displeased. \"I've already been, been a beast for three lives. It's never, never ended well. First, first I was a pig, and the butcher cut open my stomach while I was still alive. When he used boiling water to remove the pig hairs, I, I was still conscious\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu imagined the scene as he listened and couldn't help the full-bodied s.h.i.+vers that hit him.Hong Gentou continued. \"Then, then I was, was a stray dog. I could only eat others' leftovers everyday, and when I finally, finally managed to grow a little bigger, I was poi-poisoned by dog thieves. But the poison didn't kill me all at once, I was still alive for a day and a night until they opened my stomach and made me into hot, hot pot\u2026\u2026\"This time, Yu Zhengdu noticed that the other ghosts still holding their heads and squatting against the wall were shaking too.Hong Gentou's tragic life story was still going on. \"The third time, I was a mou-mouse. I ate, ate trash in the sewers and never saw daylight. After two years, to get a peanut, I was caught in a mousetrap and was b-burned to death with boiling water\u2026\u2026\"Hong Gentou's appearance was sincere. When he spoke his shoulders were squeezed together; in the end it sounded like he was about to cry. \"I got the notification text. In my next life I'm still going to be a beast. This time it'll be a head of cattle. I saw on the news, people inject, inject water into live cattle. I was scared, I didn't dare to, to reincarnate\u2026\u2026\"This crying and quivering form appeared truly wronged. Everyone watching felt compa.s.sion, even Yu Zhengdu couldn't help but whisper, \"Too tragic.\"To his side, Shang Que had one leg crossed over the other. He turned his head to one side and propped his face on his hand. He was expressionless, but after Hong Gentou finished talking, he calmly spoke. \"When you killed those people, it didn't seem like you didn't dare to kill.\"Zhen Yi slapped the arm of his chair too. \"Exactly. You're just reaping what you sowed.\"Yu Zhengdu looked curiously at Shang Que. Shang Que took out his own phone, pulled up a page, and handed it to him.Yu Zhengdu looked at what was given to him. It was Hong Gentou's record in the Life and Death Accounts. He was fine before seeing it, but after seeing it became shocked.It turned out that before Hong Gentou spent those lives as beasts, he had previously been a serial killer. In life, he had taken five human lives, his victims encompa.s.sing men, women, elders, and youth alike. On top of this, his methods of killing were extremely cruel.His record on the Life and Death Accounts was very simple, only listing the names of the victims. The more Yu Zhengdu looked at it, the more he thought the name Hong Gentou was familiar. In a moment of inspiration, he took out his own phone and typed the characters \"Hong\" \"Gen\" Tou\" in the search bar. He saw the page refresh and immediately, over ten sites relating to the topic popped up.All linked to big news platforms in the country, and the headlines were even more astonis.h.i.+ng.\u3010Minan serial killer Hong Gentou is caught\u2026\u2026\u3011\u3010Five victims in seven years, the oldest 76, the youngest only 7. Psychopathic killer Hong Gentou's life story\u2026\u2026\u3011\u3010The dark cloud that covered Minan City for seven years finally dissipates. Serial killer Hong Gentou sentenced to death after first trial\u2026\u2026\u3011Yu Zhengdu finally realized why the name Hong Gentou seemed so familiar.About a decade ago, this man committed several killings in Minan City. He took five lives in seven years, and in the cruelest ways. Because of his anti-reconnaissance skills and the fact that he looked harmless, he remained free for many years, causing general panic in Minan and its surrounding cities. Later, following the rise in abilities of detectives, he was caught during his last crime.But in his last crime, the victim was a child only 7 years of age. As soon as the news broke, citizens became enraged. Though Hong Gentou was ultimately sentenced to death, his existence was still a permanent wound in the hearts of Minan City's residents, to the point that even after several years, people still brought up the case.When Hong Gentou committed those crimes Yu Zhengdu was still young, so obviously had no memories of it. The reason he would find the name familiar was because as the Internet became more accessible, netizens would constantly dig up old files. Everytime they revisited, they would mention this case, and every time it was mentioned, a good amount of Minan's citizens would angrily protest, saying that even the death sentence was letting Hong Gentou off easy.Yu Zhengdu looked at Hong Gentou's modus operandi again, and felt the same as the netizens: just the death penalty was not enough for this deranged, malignant killer.Over there, Hong Gentou's ghost was still trying to explain himself. \"I already know I was wrong, please give me another chance to be a human\u2026\u2026\"Zhen Yi was unbothered by his pleas, sticking to the rules. \"We are a lawful Underworld. How each ghost is reincarnated is calculated by the Life and Death Accounts. It's not something that can be decided by us.\"Hong Gentou covered his face as his body shook. \"I really know what I did was wrong, please, I beg you, forgive me.\u2026\u2026\"His pitiful appearance caused the surrounding ghosts to begin a quiet discussion. Many of these ghosts were those of humans who had pa.s.sed of old age. As their ages increased, their hearts became softer, and they couldn't bear to see such a tragedy. They tried to speak up for him, saying, \"Look at how pitiful he is. He's already been a beast for several lifetimes, and each life ended in misfortune. How about letting him off a bit easier this lifetime\u2026\u2026\"\"Exactly. He was poisoned, had his belly opened, and got burned to death by boiling water. He's suffered enough\u2026\u2026\"\"I mean he could still be a beast, but he doesn't necessarily need to die so tragically.\"The surrounding voices gave Hong Gentou confidence. He used the hands covering his face to brush away some tears and looked all the more pitiful.Upon seeing this Zhen Yi waved his hand at the surrounding ghosts. \"Why are you all b.u.t.ting in, hurry and go reincarnate.\"When those old ghosts were alive, people had to give them priority during seating. They never imagined that in death, this privilege would disappear too. After hearing his words, they were quite displeased, but didn't dare rebuke h.e.l.l's workers. Yet, they also couldn't help complaining behind their backs.Even though Zhen Yi didn't care for those people, being the target of their pointing fingers still irritated him. He was just about to start yelling again, when Yu Zhengdu suddenly opened his mouth to coldly say, \"You guys aren't the victims. What makes you think you have the ability to forgive this monster in the victims' stead?\"The old ghosts who previously spoke up for him all looked over, only to see a delicate-looking young man had stood up. He looked at them expressionlessly, \"His victims will never get a second chance, how come he should get a lesser punishment just because he knows he was wrong?\"Those old ghosts had spoken incessantly because they were elders. Now that they were being questioned by Yu Zhengdu, they all shut up. But some were still unimpressed, and after seeing that Yu Zhengdu was so young, started pulling age rank. \"Young man, how could you say that. Don't you understand that you should forgive people when possible?\"Yu Zhengdu rolled his eyes. He was just about to speak again when Shang Que stood up and contemplated their surroundings. He lightly declared, \"In h.e.l.l, there is no such thing as forgiving people when possible.\"As soon as he spoke, everyone around felt the pressure he placed upon them. In an instant, n.o.body else dared to speak. The scene was silent.\"The mistakes you make when alive must be paid off in death. Even if you admit your mistakes and regret your actions, there's no use. Your wrongs and rights, merits and demerits, are all decided in life. There is no compa.s.sion in the Underworld.\" Shang Que's eyes were dark and deep; nothing was reflected in them. In this manner, he surveyed all directions. \"This is karma.\"Their surroundings remained quiet. Not even the sound of the wind could be heard. Shang Que's words about h.e.l.l's inviolability caused all the ghosts to panic, an unexplainable pressure rising in their chests.\"Papapapa\u2014\u2014\" Sudden applause broke the suffocating silence. Yu Zhengdu loudly supported his boss, \"Boss is right!\"All the other ghosts regained their bearings and hurried to clap too, \"Exactly, exactly!\"Hong Gentou saw that pretending to be pitiful was useless, so he immediately relaxed his previously s.h.i.+vering shoulders. He stood up straight and a spiteful expression replaced the previous sincerity on his face. Even his eyes dimmed quite a bit as he spoke through clenched teeth, \"I did kill people, but I've also been a beast for so many lifetimes. Each time I've died a tragic death. Even if it was to make up for my debts, this should be enough.\"His sudden hostile appearance caused all the ghosts present to become surprised. Yu Zhengdu let a long \"tsk\u2014\u2014\" escape himself, coldly stating, \"I knew it. A revengeful personality could never know to repent for their sins.\"The old ghosts who had previously spoken up for Hong Gentou were now all embarra.s.sed. They turned their heads away to avoid eye contact with Yu Zhengdu.Hong Gentou was especially bitter about this person who had been ruining his plan since the beginning. After seeing that playing the victim wasn't working, he decided that he had nothing to lose. He growled angrily and jumped up to leap towards Yu Zhengdu. At the same time, the expression on his face twisted and he bellowed, \"Either way I'm going to be a beast. Then it doesn't matter if I kill one more.\"His grey-white face suddenly exploded in the air; he had seemingly managed to suddenly grow an innumerous amount of fur. His mouth was opened very wide, showcasing a mouthful of sharp teeth.Upon seeing this Zhen Yi screamed loudly, \"f.u.c.k, he's become a malicious ghost.\"Yu Zhengdu was scared too, so he grabbed onto Shang Que's shoulders and hid behind him. At the same time, he yelled, \"f.u.c.k\u2014\u2014 Isn't this ghost a little too ugly!\"Hong Gentou's twisted appearance scared the surrounding ghosts so much they started running in every which direction, all shouting:\"Aaaaaah, a malicious ghost!!! It's a malicious ghost!!!\"\"Save me, my biggest fear are malicious ghosts!!!\"\"Is it my turn to reincarnate yet, hurry up so I can leave!\"\"It grew fur, it actually grew fur. I've been dead 30 years and this is my first time seeing one with fur\u2014\u2014\"\"My goodness, let me die again\u2014\u2014\"Yu Zhengdu: = =No way. There wasn't anything wrong with him, a living person, being scared, but couldn't any of these ghosts have some ghostly dignity?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHong Gentou's sudden rage caused chaos in the reincarnation hall. Even the ghosts who had been neatly in line became disorganized.But in comparison with Hong Gentou, who had a greenish face full of fur and sharp teeth, Yu Zhengdu thought that all the other ghosts of different shapes and sizes running all over the place were scarier.A certain excited old man, can you please not take your legs off and carry them in your arms as you run. They're not prosthetics!!Hong Gentou was very pleased with the terror his appearance caused. His entire body became even bigger; his mouth opened all the way to his ears. His foul-smelling saliva dripped onto his chin and his bloodred eyes stared directly at Yu Zhengdu. His voice was hoa.r.s.e and bloodthirsty, \"I haven't killed in so long. I really missed this feeling so much\u2014\u2014\"\"You wis.h.!.+\" Yu Zhengdu popped his head out from behind Boss's shoulders. \"Boss, hurry, it's lunchtime!\"Shang Que: \"\u2026\u2026\"He didn't move at all. After a bit, he finally reluctantly opened his mouth to say, \"I'm not eating that, it's too ugly.\"Yu Zhengdu had a headache. \"Now's not the time to be picky!\"Shang Que: \"\u2026\u2026Un?\"As they spoke, the vengeful air around Hong Gentou was so thick it seemed to almost solidify. He leapt over aggressively, laughing wildly, \"Come with me to Purgatory\u2014\u2014\"Yu Zhengdu's heart had lifted to his throat. He hurriedly pushed his boss forward. \"Charge, Boss\u2014\u2014\"Shang Que softly laughed in exasperation. \"I'm not moving.\"Yu Zhengdu bargained with him. \"\u2026\u2026Then can you cover for me, I need some time to make a run for it.\"At this time, Zheng Yi's outraged cussing sounded from the side, \"This punka.s.s b.i.t.c.h, he dares disturb our reincarnation order!\"Yu Zhengdu turned to look, only to see Zheng Yi whip out a pistol from behind his back and smoothly undo the safety. He fired at Hong Gentou, who was still in midair.The sound of the gunshot was very unique. It didn't seem like a weapon from the mortal realm because there was no metallic noise. Instead, it seemed more like there was a thin cord connected to your nerves that caused one's body to suddenly s.h.i.+ver when pulled upon.There was no sign of a bullet either. Hong Gentou, who was midair and about 3 or 4 times his normal size, suddenly shook his head. He let out a pained cry as he fell, only to pause halfway as all the vengeance surrounding him dissipated. Soon after, his gigantic body provided an example of what was called \"free-falling\".Only to hear a \"peng\u2014\u2014\" as Hong Gentou crashed to the ground in front of Shang Que in a pile.Shang Que and Yu Zhengdu each took a step back in sync. Yu Zhengdu popped out from behind Shang Que's shoulders to look at the swollen ghost bundle on the ground. Though he was still scared, his mood was very complex. \"Do you guys dare to have a more scientific way of catching ghosts?!\"He was just about to ask that when the lump on the ground violently trembled. Hong Gentou lifted his enormous head, still struggling. \"I want you to accompany me in death\u2014\u2014\"Because he had fallen flat on his face, Hong Gentou's originally twisted expression was even scarier now.Yu Zhengdu: \"Argh\u2014\u2014\"He had just started screaming, only to see a group of uniformed ghosts carrying sticks rush in from far away. They trapped Hong Gentou in a circle and aggressively started beating him with their sticks, hitting him with their fists, and kicking him with their feet.\"Motherf.u.c.ker! Ruining the order!\"\"Today's reincarnations are going to get pushed back again, s.h.i.+t. Making me have to work overtime!!!\"\"Harder, beat this a.s.shole to death!!!\"Yu Zhengdu didn't manage to finish his scream; it got stuck halfway in his throat: \"\u2026\u2026\"Hong Gentou, who had previously looked so intimidating and vicious, now looked a little formless after he was lifted off the ground. His body had deflated like a balloon and returned to its original size, but there were dips everywhere from where he was beaten. This form somehow seemed even scarier than when he had been a malicious ghost.One security guard ghost still wasn't pleased. Upon hearing him groan, he smacked him on the back of the head with his stick. \"Quiet.\"Zhen Yi put his gun back in its holster and ordered the security guards to tow Hong Gentou to the side of the ancient well. He spat, \"These unrepenting evil ghosts, only reincarnating as a beast is not enough of a punishment!\"Yu Zhengdu nodded his head in agreement.Shang Que remained indifferent, only saying, \"Contact Kang Jin. Update his information.\"Zhen Yi hurriedly pulled out his phone to call headquarters. Soon after, a pleased expression made its way onto his face. \"Headquarters recalculated Hong Gentou's merits and demerits. Adding together escaping from reincarnation, threatening a living human, showing no sign of repentance, and turning into a malicious ghost out of vengeance, Hong Gentou still needs to reincarnate into a beast for three more lives. And he's going to get the most painful and tragic deaths!\"Shang Que nodded and lowered his eyes. His voice was cold, \"After he has suffered enough from being a beast, three lives later, place him in the hungry ghost path, never to enter samsara again.\"As soon as Shang Que said this, everyone gasped. The old man who had taken off both his legs to hold in his arms dropped his legs as his jaw also dropped.Yu Zhengdu only had a minimal grasp on the six paths, so he didn't completely understand the meaning behind this decision. But just from hearing the name he already knew that path wasn't a good one.As expected, Hong Gentou, who had previously been so unafraid and thought that at most he would be a beast for a couple more lifetimes, now housed actual terror in his eyes. His entire body trembled and twitched as he begged, \"Don't be like this to me, I'm begging you, no\u2014\u2014 I don't want to go down the hungry ghost path\u2014\u2014\"Shang Que was unbothered. He gently lifted a hand; the security guards all immediately nodded and forcefully pushed Hong Gentou into the ancient well. All that was left was a terrified and chilling screech.After dealing with Hong Gentou, Zhen Yi took the chance to explain to all the other ghosts present, \"As you saw, running away and threatening the mortal realm results in this punishment. Everyone please do your best to maintain order and responsibly reincarnate.\"After he spoke, the other security guards also started to restore order. The numbers on the digital screen continued to jump. The gentle female voice began again, \"Can client number 1866 please head over to the second pa.s.sageway to line up for reincarnation\u2014\u2014\"\"Can client number 1867 please head over to the third pa.s.sageway to line up for reincarnation\u2014\u2014\"Order was quickly restored, but it was clear that the awkward atmosphere wouldn't be going away soon. Many ghosts looked at the ones still squatting in the corner with pity. Still don't know what's going to happen to them.Zhen Yi was very pleased about this. The reason they chose to question these ghosts in the middle of the reincarnation hall was exactly to make an example out of them. He rubbed his hands and looked ingratiatingly at Shang Que, \"Boss, shall we continue to question them?\"Shang Que nodded and elegantly returned to his seat.Yu Zhengdu turned his head to look, only to see the group of ghosts who had previously been squatting in a line had, at some unknown point, cl.u.s.tered together. They were holding each other's heads and crying, all regretful as could be:\"I won't do it again, I'll never do it again. Don't send me to the hungry ghost path\u2014\u2014\"\"I really lost my mind. Being a pig is nothing, at most I would become a roast pig. Anything is better than going to the hungry ghost path!\"\"Wuwuwu, it's all because of Hong Gentou. He lied and told me that as long as we escaped we would become free spirits! I hate him!\"Zhen Yi pointed to the free spirit and said, \"You, step out.\"The spirit shook and cried as it stood up. \"I'll never do it again, I really won't do it again.\"Zhen Yi asked sternly, \"Why did you escape with Hong Gentou?\"Free spirit wiped at his tears and explained, \"I received a text that notified me in the next life I would be a chicken. I was scared\u2026\u2026\"Zhen Yi hummed coldly. \"If you were really that scared, you shouldn't have committed so many crimes when you were alive.\"Free spirit started crying as if he were wronged. \"I didn't know the consequences to hiring prost.i.tutes would be so severe!\"At first Yu Zhengdu thought he was also a cruel and evil murderer, but after hearing this, he started. He turned to look at Shang Que with an expression of surprise. \"Wait, if you hire a prost.i.tute you, become a chicken. What kind of chicken?\"Shang Que looked at him strangely. \"Your normal, average chicken.\"Free spirit was still crying. \"Hong Gentou told me, chickens get beheaded and they start plucking your feathers before you stop breathing. And maybe when you aren't even completely dead they'll just throw you into the pot to make broth. He has a lot of experience being a beast, so I believed him. I didn't do it on purpose, I'm just really scared of pain. I was scared of getting my feathers plucked\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu was shocked. \"If you hire prost.i.tutes when you're alive, you have to turn into a chicken when you die?\"Shang Que propped his head on his hand and answered lazily, \"If you hire prost.i.tutes frequently, yes.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"What's considered frequent?\"Zhen Yi turned his head to respond. \"This person started hiring prost.i.tutes from age 16, all the way till he was infected by STDs from the prost.i.tutes and died at age 66. He didn't even stop when he got married in the middle of those years, and got his wife sick with the diseases he caught from outside.\"After he was exposed, free spirit dipped his head in shame. He covered his face. \"I really didn't know it was so serious, or I definitely wouldn't have dared to hire prost.i.tutes.\"Zhen Yi contacted headquarters and said, \"The Life and Death Account's information has been updated. We considered you to be influenced by Hong Gentou, and you didn't do anything harmful to society when you escaped. Your actions weren't too severe, so you'll still spend the next life as a chicken. You'll just be a disease-infected chicken.\"Free spirit was overjoyed at this news. \"A disease-infected chicken! That means n.o.body will want to eat me, right. I won't get my feathers plucked!\"Yu Zhengdu couldn't help but explain, \"Disease-infected chickens are all killed at the same time. It's just a different way of dying.\"Free spirit: smile slowly disappears.After free spirit was questioned, he was also chaperoned by the security guards to the ancient well and pushed in. All the other ghosts in the group had also committed crimes in life and were about to reincarnate into beasts, so were moved when Hong Gentou intimidated them with his stories. But after seeing what happened to Hong Gentou, they didn't dare to have any other ideas, obediently getting questioned and sent to reincarnation.And on the other side of the reincarnation hall, those who had originally wanted to escape but failed to felt immense relief. This time, the warning was clear and very successful. In the future, it was unlikely that anyone would be persuaded to escape too.After resolving the issue with the escaped ghosts, Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que took a taxi back together.On the way, Shang Que answered a few calls from the company, confirming the reincarnation outcomes of the escaped ghosts. After seeing the curiosity on Yu Zhengdu's face, he let him look at the picture that Kang Jin sent him.Yu Zhengdu looked at the picture of the egg in confusion.Shang Que laughed. \"This is the guy who hired prost.i.tutes.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026The reincarnation speed is quite fast.\"He looked at the picture closely again, and still thought it was unbelievable. \"I didn't think the Underworld was so strict. Hiring prost.i.tutes and you have to reincarnate as a chicken.\"Shang Que took back his phone, thought about it, and said, \"That's not exactly it. It's just that the Life and Death Account's computational algorithm is a little outdated.\"He gave Yu Zhengdu some materials. It was only then that Yu Zhengdu found out, the algorithm that Luofeng used for the Life and Death Accounts was based off the original standards from before the heavens split and the earth sank. Those original standards that h.e.l.l used were created 2,000 years ago and remained in use even to this day. Though they had been changed here and there, the most basic rules were still largely the same. For example, the most severe crimes, the \"10 Sins\", were identical to those from thousands of years ago.Very \"feudal.\"After hearing this Yu Zhengdu couldn't help but criticize, \"That's so outdated. It's already the year 8102.\"Shang Que nodded. \"Times are changing, so the Life and Death Account's computations should change accordingly. But updating the standards is a difficult task, and n.o.body in the company is capable of performing it.\"Yu Zhengdu thought about it and agreed. It was similar to changing laws; one change could lead to many. It truly wasn't an easy task.He thought about the egg and how comical it was. Ultimately, however, these weren't things he could control. He pondered for a little longer before stopping and using his brain for other things.He asked, \"What's the hungry ghost path like?\"After a while of receiving no response, Yu Zhengdu turned his head to look, only to see Shang Que had already lowered his head at some unknown time to focus on his phone. The screen displayed the page of a popular mobile game.Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\"Boss really took every opportunity he got.After a while, an unhappy expression showed up on Shang Que's face. \"I got killed again.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\"Even though Boss worked so hard, his skills were really not that great!Yu Zhengdu comforted him. \"Who hasn't died a few times in a game, you'll get used to it.\"Shang Que protested, \"It's because my equipment isn't good enough! This guy is someone who spends a lot of money in-game.\"Yu Zhengdu sincerely suggested, \"Boss, how about we try to come up with more ways to earn money. This way we can spare some for your gaming needs.\"Otherwise if the famous Ghost King's tales of being beaten up in a game became public, it would be bad for the company's reputation.Yu Zhengdu only said it on a whim, but Shang Que's eyes immediately lit up. \"You're right!\"After this interruption, the topic of the hungry ghost path disappeared.Shang Que put his phone away and leaned back against the seat. He sighed, \"Things in the mortal realm really cost too much money.\"As soon as he finished, his phone rang with a ding. The text notifying him of Wei Xiao's money transfer had arrived. Shang Que was very pleased with his att.i.tude. \"We can continue to work with clients like these for a long time.\"Yu Zhengdu thought about it and took out the marionette. He posed it in a kneeling position and took a photo, then sent it to Wei Xiao, adding the caption, \"After-sales service.\"Wei Xiao replied very quickly.Wei Xiao:\u3010There's no need to be so polite, really!!!!\u3011Updating as I wait for my flight to board QQPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter reaching the company, Yu Zhengdu handed the marionette to his coworker for examination. He found out that the ghost inside the marionette was an orphan that unfortunately was on the receiving end of a Daoist's evil spell. It died because of this, and its spirit was contained and refined by the Daoist to be his servant. It eventually escaped, but couldn't stop obsessing over how it had been wronged. As it also hadn't resolved its grudge with the Daoist, it couldn't enter samsara, and could only spend its time wandering through the mortal realm.In these circ.u.mstances. Luofeng couldn't order him into reincarnation either. There was also no need for incarceration, so in the end he only received a lecture, was warned not to scare people anymore, and was released.As graduation season drew closer, the number of posts on the nation's famous IT skill discussion forum, starflicker, increased too. Most were hopeful graduates asking for help on their senior thesis designs. Technology forums typically were not too friendly regarding these kinds of question posts, and the experts normally wouldn't even bother answering, unless the question was particularly interesting. Because of this, most posts were only popular for a short period of time before completely disappearing.But in the past few days, a post on the forum garnered the attention of quite a few people. There was a lot of discussion around it too; even those big experts who rarely commented on the forum replied to the post.But most people weren't paying attention to the content of the post. Instead, they were shocked by the author and t.i.tle.t.i.tle: Logically discussing the probability of using code to lessen the effects of some parents using C-sections to change children's times of birth.Contents: As everyone knows, with the advance of medicine, Cesarean sections have become all the rage. Some parents will use this technology to change the natural time of birth of their children. Imagine all newborns' birth times were scheduled by a system; how should one use code to create a program that would lessen the side effects created from a change in birth date after C-section?Author: singerThe post was made two days ago. Not long after, it became one of the most popular posts.Floor 1: When did an elementary school student sneak into the forum?Floor 2: When I saw the t.i.tle I was shocked. Was just about to mock them when I read the author's name. My smile froze\u2026\u2026Floor 3: I clicked into the author's homepage 3 times. It's the real deal, not a high-quality imitator.Floor 4: In reply to floor 1, open your eyes and look at the author. If singer is an elementary school student, then this forum is probably preschool.Floor 5: What happened? The expert got hacked?Floor 6: singer finally posted? This topic is quite interesting.Floor 58: I reread this post 30 times and still don't understand. Is my IQ so far off from the expert's?Floor 59: [osone]: Thanks for the invite. Clicked in with the intent of discussing cutting edge technology with singer. Let me smoke a cigarette first to calm down, smoking.jpgFloor 345: [lan]: Thanks for the invite. If it were anyone else making this kind of post I would just ignore them, but since it's singer, then I'll simply a.n.a.lyze the probability. Typically speaking\u2026\u2026 (here we have omitted 6,756 words)Floor 346: Oh s.h.i.+t, expert lan really replied!Floor 347: As soon as I saw expert lan's cla.s.sic opening, \"I will simply a.n.a.lyze it\", I knew that the response wouldn't be simple.Floor 348: Me after seeing the t.i.tle: Are you kidding me? After seeing expert lan's response: I can never catch up with the expert's IQ.Floor 349: At this time I don't know if I should first kneel in front of singer who came up with this question or lan who replied to it\u2026\u2026Floor 555: [singer]: In reply to lan, the method you proposed is doable to a degree, but when operationalized in real life, the following issues appeared\u2026\u2026 (here we have omitted 3,860 words) In regards to this, I believe we have more to discuss.Floor 556: What did I just see? I didn't even understand lan's response but singer already operationalized it??? Can the experts mind us normal people's dignities?Floor 557: [osone]: I've finished smoking. Since lan brought up the probability, and singer already operationalized it, then let me also propose my ideas\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 (here we have omitted \"n\" amount of words)Floor 664: [singer]: osone's suggestion has resolved the issues with lan's proposal to a degree, but not completely. Upon operationalization we encounter the following problems\u2026\u2026 (here we have omitted \"n\" amount of words)Floor 665: When I first saw singer's t.i.tle I thought it was a joke. But after seeing these experts' responses, I've been educated.Floor 666: Since upstairs is the battle of G.o.ds, I'll just go with my floor number and say, 666.Floor 667: 666Floor 668: 666As the nation's top technology discussion forum, quite a few of starflicker's forum IDs were owned by famous technicians, the top in the field. For example, taking from the replies alone, osone and lan were rumored to be important employees of the top 5 technology companies in the nation.These experts normally only observed and rarely posted. As soon as they posted, there would definitely be onlookers. And now this post received replies from both osone and lan, so it obviously became the most popular post on the forum.But both osone and lan showing up had nothing to do with the subject of the post, instead, it was because the author of the post was singer.singer registered on starflicker four years ago. From his somewhat immature posts in the beginning to the incredible advances he made later on, in two years he became on the same level as lan and other experts on the forum. It got to the point that even if he casually commented something, someone would specially go find his comment to take a picture with it.singer had been very active on the forum a few years back, his replies commonly seen under many different questions. Even now, if you clicked into his homepage, you could see his glorious history, when he and the other experts exchanged ideas and skills. Not only that, but word on the streets was that he had privately helped some experts like lan and osone resolve certain issues with their technology, so they all owed him.But from the second half of last year, singer had become obviously less active. Especially since he hadn't posted anything since the start of this year.Because of this, as soon as he posted, some busybodies immediately invited lan and the other experts to come and reply. Originally, a lot of those who saw the t.i.tle thought that singer had been provoked and was joking, but they never imagined that lan and the others could still answer professionally. And singer could reply to them logically.This caused the melon-eating audience to become shocked and surprised. The tower was getting taller and taller, but still several people refused to believe that singer's question was legit. Half of the tower's thousands of floors were discussing singer's actual reason for posting.The actual reason singer posted was truly not that complicated. He simply ran into some problems in real life.The owner of the singer account, Yu Zhengdu, just finished replying to lan's latest comment on his post. He didn't even spare a glance for the melon-eating audience's fantasies, directly closing the page and beginning work.After the accidental collaboration with Wei Xiao temporarily relieved the company's financial pressures, Yu Zhengdu finally started to examine the problem of creating a system out of the Life and Death Accounts. But the company only had him as their program developer, and he would undoubtedly run into many problems while he worked. Thankfully the age of the Internet had its own solutions. After getting Shang Que's permission regarding the contents of the post, he started to post on the forum.Because of his status as a technological expert, all the other experts were more than willing to discuss with him. After these few days, he had managed to resolve several problems too, but it was not quite likely that he would be capable of completing the whole system by himself.Yu Zhengdu operationalized lan's latest theory, removing some bugs along the way. In between this, he took a drink of water and peeked at his phone, only to see several WeChat notifications.lan:\u3010Were you serious about the question you posted on the forum?\u3011lan:\u3010I'll be back in the country next month. Let's meet face to face to discuss the issue you have with Nova\u3011lan:\u3010When are you taking your graduation picture, I'll go cheer you on\u3011lan:\u3010I'm about to start my own laboratory. I'll apply for you to be in the first group of people working. With company shares\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010Ey\u3011lan:\u3010?\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010You might have to wait a year for me\u2026\u2026\u3011lan:\u3010What does that mean? What happened?\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010My own fault. I shouldn't have been greedy about wanting the 5 insurances and housing fund\u2026\u2026\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010I'll tell you when you come back 0.0\u3011lan:\u3010\u2026\u2026\u3011Yu Zhengdu ignored lan's heartwrenching cries and calmly exited from WeChat. He grabbed his laptop to go find Shang Que.Shang Que was in the middle of charging through his in-game world. But contrary to normal circ.u.mstances, this time the corners of his mouth were raised; it seemed that he wasn't getting beaten up.As expected, as soon as he saw Yu Zhengdu enter, Shang Que immediately bragged to him, \"I've gotten my revenge!\"Yu Zhengdu very politely applauded him. \"Congratulations.\"Shang Que lifted his head and saw that he was holding his laptop, so immediately let go of his mouse and regained the usual cold expression on his face. He lightly coughed and spoke, \"Let's talk about work.\"Due to the severe lack of employees, the product design portion of the Life and Death Accounts system had fallen into Shang Que's hands. He was temporarily taking the place of the product manager.Yu Zhengdu reported his progress. After hearing his report, Shang Que nodded and said, \"Un.\"Yu Zhengdu already knew him fairly well. The \"un\" probably meant that he understood nothing. But he didn't expect his boss to know anything about technology, and only inquired, \"Do you have any new ideas in regards to the product's design?\"As soon as he asked this, Shang Que's eyes lit up. He leaned forward. \"Yes.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\" He was just being polite.But Shang Que thought he was being serious. It seemed that he had prepared for this as he gently rubbed his fingers and seriously stated, \"I think we can add a program into the system that can reconfigure appearances.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"????\"Shang Que impressively understood the question marks on his face for once, and very kindly explained to him, \"When our coworkers are on the job, ghosts often come to ask questions about their appearance after reincarnation. A lot of ghosts were ugly in their past lives and hope they can become better looking in the next.\"Shang Que's face was contemplative. \"I can understand their frustrations too\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu looked at Boss's devastatingly beautiful appearance, extremely confused about his frustrations. He asked, \"How come you can understand these types of frustrations?\"Shang Que: \"The game I'm playing recently, at first I didn't choose a good looking face. It was so ugly I almost abandoned my account. But yesterday I reconfigured the face, and as expected, I now feel much better playing\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\"The more he heard, the more Yu Zhengdu thought something was off. He casually turned Boss's computer so the screen was facing himself. Everytime he had come to see Boss, the man had been playing his game, so he was more than familiar with what characters his boss used. It only took a glance for him to see the difference. He really did switch faces.Yu Zhengdu: !!!!To reconfigure an appearance in this game meant that you had to spend money!He took a closer look at the character and found that not only did he switch faces, his equipment had also gotten exponentially better! No wonder Boss wasn't getting beat up anymore!Yu Zhengdu looked at Shang Que expressionlessly. \"Boss, are you spending money on your games?\"Shang Que originally didn't see an issue with this, and was even quite pleased. But after being questioned by Yu Zhengdu, his smile unknowingly froze. His gaze s.h.i.+fted to the floor as he pretended nothing happened. \"Ah, I spent a little.\"Yu Zhengdu tsk'd. \"Do you know how tight our development budget is?\"Shang Que felt a bit guilty. \"Didn't you say we could spare some for my games\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu looked at him speechlessly, then asked, \"Do you know how much you're worth?\"Shang Que didn't know.Yu Zhengdu went for the kill, \"Around 228,000 RMB.\"Shang Que, the unambitious boss, said, \"That's.. not bad!\"Luofeng's accounts normally only had enough RMB to sc.r.a.pe by paying rent and the water and electricity bills. If you compared the savings now to how much Luofeng historically had, it really was not so bad.Yu Zhengdu told him emotionlessly, \"That's bad.\"He crossed both arms over his chest. \"Just the money you have right now, after paying my salary, there's barely enough left to create a small program.\"He continued to strike blows, \"How about, you consider only creating a small program.\"Shang Que immediately became alert. \"No.\"Yu Zhengdu stared at him wordlessly.After getting stared at, Shang Que surrendered and dejectedly rested his head on his hand. He sulked, \"Before our company gets rich, I'll never spend money on my games again.\"Yu Zhengdu nodded, and continued, \"Aside from this, I think we need to hire a professional product manager.\"Shang Que was unimpressed. \"Haven't I been doing a good job!\"Yu Zhengdu stared at him in judgement. \"You mean your suggestion to ignore the power of genes and try to add a facial reconstruction feature to the Life and Death Accounts?\"Shang Que: \"\u2026\u2026\"Shang Que felt slightly depressed. \"Isn't this suggestion very humane?\"Yu Zhengdu was very depressed too. \"Not only humane, you're simply a product genius!\" The real kind of \"ghost.\"Shang Que: \"\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu calmed himself down. He very seriously suggested, \"Boss, you should spend less time on playing games and more on coming up with ways to earn money!\"After leaving Shang Que's office, Yu Zhengdu thought he was going to worry himself to death. His contract with Luofeng was only for a year; if he didn't successfully create the program within a year, he didn't know how the company was going to resolve this issue in the future.The more he thought about it, the more depressed he became, so he simply decided to pull up a stress-relieving game he had made in the past. He changed it a bit and started playing.That coworker whose eyes were often tired pa.s.sed behind him on his way to the breakroom. As soon as he saw the computer screen, he became surprised and leaned over to ask, \"Wow, what game is this?\"These ghosts often travelled soundlessly. Yu Zhengdu wasn't focused and got caught red-handed. He hurriedly covered the computer and made a 'sh\u2014\u2014\" hand sign. \"Speak softer.\"But that coworker was extremely excited. He shook the hand holding his eyes to and fro in front of the screen. \"I saw Boss's face. Let me see what it is.\"Yu Zhengdu almost had a heart attack. \"\u2026\u2026Can you put your eyes back first?\"His coworker's eyeb.a.l.l.s spun around to look at him. \"Just let me see it.\"Yu Zhengdu could do nothing but carefully observe their surroundings and finally let go of the computer screen after seeing no one else around. He said quietly, \"Don't tell anyone. This is a little game I made where you can dress up the Ghost King\u2026\u2026\"On the screen, Shang Que had just changed into a red dress\u2026\u2026The coworker: \"Holy s.h.i.+t!!\"The eyeb.a.l.l.s in his hands were sparkling. \"This is so cool, install one for me too!!!\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOn this day, Yu Zhengdu was in the middle of writing code when he received Shang Que's hara.s.sing messages.My broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010I remembered a way to earn money. It's one religious men used all the time in the past\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010?\u3011My broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010But only living humans can use this skill. It's up to you if you want to sacrifice yourself for money\u3011Yu Zhengdu immediately became alert after reading Shang Que's message. Ever since he had been forced to stop spending money on his games and once again re-entered the cycle of getting beaten up, Shang Que had become a bit depressed. He now spent a large amount of his energy on planning how to get rich, but it seemed that the ways to earn money differed greatly between the Underworld and mortal realm.Yu Zhengdu:\u3010What skill is it?\u3011My broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010Have you heard of the Five Ghosts Money Transporting spell?\u3011Of course Yu Zhengdu had never heard of it. But he was 120% careful everytime his boss had a suggestion, so resolutely decided to search it up online.The supposed Five Ghosts Money Transporting spell was one that used magic to control five ghosts to transport money. The ghosts would move other people's money into the spellcaster's home. It was also known as the Five Ghosts Underworld Debt spell and was originally created as a way to borrow from the Underworld; the spell could easily rebound.Yu Zhengdu:\u3010\u2026\u2026Isn't this an evil spell!\u3011My broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010Yeah, but don't you mortals normally say, riches can only be obtained from dangerous situations?\u3011My broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010Besides, my abilities are very orthodox. It'll be a lot less dangerous than if it were cast by some random mortal.\u3011Yu Zhengdu read his boss's response and somehow felt that he was reading the ad from a WeChat business: Our abilities are the best! No side effects or dangers!Yu Zhengdu thought about it and replied:\u3010Thanks to your idea, I just thought of a way to make money too. It's very suitable for our company and is ethical, so there's no danger\u3011My broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010What is it?\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010The Five Ghosts Money Transporting spell is too off the rails, it's not suited for us, but you can consider changing it up to make a Five Ghosts Brick Transporting spell. We'll try to become the boss of the construction site\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010If you do well, maybe you can even become the contractor\u3011My broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010\u2026\u2026\u3011Soon after, Shang Que left his office and pulled up a chair to sit next to Yu Zhengdu. He crossed his legs and propped his chin on his hand; matched with his handsome features, his entire being radiated an eye-catching aura.Yu Zhengdu remained focused on his computer screen, fingers incessantly tapping at the keyboard. He didn't even spare a glance.A pause later, Shang Que heavily sighed. \"Will we really have to control ghosts to move bricks?\"Yu Zhengdu could only turn his head to look at him. It was true, Boss's appearance was very elite, his clothes seemed high-end and one couldn't tell he was poor at all. He couldn't help teasing him, \"Don't worry, you'll definitely be the most handsome man on the construction site.\"Shang Que: \"\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu wanted to make fun of him some more, but he got another notification on WeChat. It was from Li Tiantian, who hadn't contacted him for a while since he gifted her a stone.Li Tiantian:\u3010Student Yu, does your company still have those luck-changing magnets?\u3011Li Tiantian:\u3010I want to buy one for my friend\u3011Li Tiantian:\u3010She happens to be here in the park district too. If you have it, we can go pick it up from your company right now\u3011Yu Zhengdu blanked out for a moment before regaining his composure. He glanced at Boss, a little disbelieving. \"Someone wants to come back for more of this stuff? No wonder people who do business in selling crystals are doing so well\u2026\u2026\"Shang Que thought about it briefly and said, \"Tell them they can come pick it up.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\"Seems like Boss really doesn't want to be a brick mover.But even though their company was poor, Yu Zhengdu didn't want to become a dishonest businessman. He continued talking with Li Tiantian to find out what was going on.It turned out that Li Tiantian was unhappy about receiving a stone from Yu Zhengdu last time, believing that he was fooling around with her, so privately complained to her best friends about the strange stone-gifting man she met. She never imagined, though, that when she got home that day, her luck started to get better. Not only were her shoulders not sore anymore, her mental state became a lot better too.Because the timing was too coincidental, and Li Tiantian already was the type of girl to believe in horoscopes and such, she obviously suspected that this was due to the stone. Afterwards, she started carrying the stone with her wherever she went, and as expected, her work and life all became smoother. Just a few days ago, she even got a pay raise.This made Li Tiantian treasure the stone even more, and she took to sharing her experience with her best friends. But because the stone's appearance was nothing special, despite her guarantee that it was special, her friends didn't believe her. In comparison, they preferred beautiful crystals more.Today's situation was due to the fact that one of Li Tiantian's best friends had recently acquired a bout of bad luck for some unknown reason. Her mental state wasn't that great either, which was somewhat similar to what had happened to Li Tiantian before. Thus, Li Tiantian strongly recommended the magnets from Yu Zhengdu's company. But her best friend didn't believe in such things and ignored her recommendation. Coincidentally, she had some business in the area today and so met with Li Tiantian for lunch, which is why Li Tiantian was adamant about bringing her over.After Yu Zhengdu figured out this reason, he was still a bit unsure of what to do. It was important to know that Li Tiantian's prior bad luck was because a ghost was hara.s.sing her. After the ghost was arrested, she naturally became better; it had nothing to do with the stone. It was unlikely that her best friend coincidentally was also being hara.s.sed by a ghost. That would mean that there was an overabundance of ghosts.Shang Que didn't have the worries he did, eloquently explaining, \"Humans don't get bad luck out of nowhere. Even if it isn't an evil ghost bothering them, it's more than likely they ran into something. We can solve these problems too.\"Yu Zhengdu glanced at his boss out of the corner of his eye, only to see Boss lightly smile, \"Of course, they'll have to pay.\"Li Tiantian and her best friend arrived very soon. Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que greeted them together.Upon entering the company, the two girls had very different reactions. Li Tiantian and Yu Zhengdu were familiar with each other, so after exchanging greetings, she joked, \"Your company is so lowkey, I almost didn't find it.\"Yu Zhengdu: \u2026\u2026You can simply say our company is small!Li Tiantian's best friend was called Chen Siyu. One could tell that she came from a well-off family: she was dressed from head to toe in brand-name clothing. The company was obviously much smaller than she had imagined, and the distrust oozed out from her eyes quite obviously.Yu Zhengdu understood her. A company of this size, working in this environment, and claiming they sold luck-changing magnets? If it were him in this situation, he probably would have already called the police.He could tell that Chen Siyu was uninterested in the luck-changing magnets Li Tiantian was strongly recommending. Seeing as she was already there and also didn't want to embarra.s.s her friend, she reluctantly asked, \"How much for one of your luck-changing magnets? Give me one. I still have something after this so I need to leave soon.\"Chen Siyu didn't seem to be in good shape, but there also weren't any ghosts following her around. Her situation was clearly different from Li Tiantian's.Yu Zhengdu didn't know what was up with her either, so could only say, \"There's no rush. We don't sell our magnets randomly; it's dependent on different situations.\"Chen Siyu seemed a bit impatient. \"Then guess what situation you think I have and give me that stone.\"Li Tiantian currently had a bit of blind trust for Yu Zhengdu's company, so after hearing her best friend's words, she hurriedly tapped her shoulder, and said placatingly, \"Aiya, Siyu, don't be in such a hurry. Student Yu and his company are very professional, just listen to him.\"Chen Siyu secretly glared at Li Tiantian. She didn't understand why her best friend, who had received higher education, was so brainwashed.She had never believed in these random things that couldn't be scientifically proven. In her eyes, what Li Tiantian said about a stone changing her luck for the better was just a coincidence and purely psychological.But Li Tiantian had always liked to talk about horoscopes and such, so after encountering such a situation she became even more obsessed. The two reasons Chen Siyu had come with her were because she knew that her best friend meant well and because she wanted to take this opportunity to prove that this company wasn't magical at all, only a group of scammers.Yu Zhengdu pretended he didn't see Chen Siyu roll her eyes. He elbowed Shang Que and said, \"Boss, take a look at what's wrong with Miss Chen.\"Shang Que hadn't spoken a word since the two girls had walked in the door. Right now he was currently leaning against the back of his chair and looking very apathetic. Upon hearing Yu Zhengdu speak to him, he finally lifted his eyes and declared indifferently, \"I don't really want to.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026?\"Yu Zhengdu turned to look at him and saw he was very reluctant. \"She has a poor att.i.tude.\"Yu Zhengdu paused momentarily, and then finally understood. Shang Que wasn't someone who needed to bow to others. He was someone born as the Ghost King, never experiencing the sufferings and hards.h.i.+ps of being human. Even though he was slightly poor in the mortal realm, he still had an image to uphold.According to legend, humans in the past wors.h.i.+pped him. No one ever dared to speak to him with such an att.i.tude.The fact that Shang Que hadn't eaten Chen Siyu then and there was a testament to his good temperament.Chen Siyu didn't know what an honor she had received. Upon hearing Shang Que's words, her face became dark. \"If you don't want to then you don't need to. Tiantian, let's go.\"Li Tiantian never imagined the scene would play out like this. She hurriedly grabbed her. \"Ey, we're already here. You won't lose anything if you let them take a look.\"Chen Siyu's tone of voice wasn't so great. \"What do you mean I won't lose anything. That stupid stone costs money.\"Shang Que took out his phone and started playing games.Li Tiantian: \"\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\"It was over. Boss had gone on strike.Li Tiantian subtly tugged on the corner of Yu Zhengdu's s.h.i.+rt. \"Student Yu, it's alright if you're the one who takes a look, too.\"Yu Zhengdu looked at Li Tiantian's naive expression. He really wanted to say I really don't know how.He paused, and then suddenly thought of something. He hurriedly called for Chen Siyu, \"Miss Chen, how about this. Let me do a health a.s.sessment for you first.\"Chen Siyu was so mad she almost laughed. Wasn't this the usual trick vendors selling healthcare products used?She mocked, \"What kind of health a.s.sessment? Are you going to take my blood pressure?\"Yu Zhengdu didn't get angry, only smiling as he said, \"It's a new program that our company just created. It can a.s.sess your recent health and luck score.\"Chen Siyu: \"\u2026\u2026\"Li Tiantian looked at him in confusion, \"You guys have that kind of technology?\"Even Shang Que also put his phone down and lifted his head to look at him.Yu Zhengdu didn't bother going into detail. He ran back to his own seat and grabbed the work phone that the company had given him. He opened an app in the phone and pointed the camera at Chen Siyu, \"Don't move yet, let me just scan you first.\"Now even Li Tiantian thought this was a bit unreliable. She asked suspiciously, \"Why does it feel like you're scanning a barcode?\"Yu Zhengdu smiled, \"It's different. Our app utilizes unique technology belonging to our company that can use an image of a person to a.n.a.lyze their recent condition. It can also be used to examine one's health and luck.\"Chen Siyu finally couldn't hold herself back. She dragged Li Tiantian to her side and quietly scolded, \"I told you that this was a scam company but you refused to believe me. Using an app to a.n.a.lyze luck, do you think that sounds reasonable?\"Li Tiantian's expression was a little awkward too. She temporarily didn't know how to face Yu Zhengdu, stammering out, \"Student Yu, how about, we just won't buy it\u2026\u2026\"Before she finished speaking, Yu Zhengdu looked at his phone screen and started talking. \"Miss Chen's current condition isn't very ideal. Her back and side are a little bit chilly, but it's nothing severe. You won't need to go to the hospital. Your luck score is also a bit low, so be careful when you're out and about, as it'll be more likely for something to go wrong.\"Following his words, Chen Siyu's previously angry expression slowly changed, but she still refused to give in. She asked carefully, \"That's what Tiantian told you, right?\"Li Tiantian made an \"ah\" noise. She sounded uncertain, \"I told him a little bit, but not with so many details.\"Yu Zhengdu continued, \"Your situation isn't that serious. You don't need to change your luck, just to rest for a few days and to go get some more sunlight.\"Chen Siyu saw that he had nothing else to say so decided it must have been a stroke of luck. She was just about to continue mocking him, when the very indifferent boss next to him spoke up. \"Her situation isn't serious, but someone in her family's situation is very serious.\"Chen Siyu was shocked and lifted her head to look at Shang Que.Shang Que had already put down his phone, but didn't look at her. Instead, he grabbed Yu Zhengdu's phone. \"When did you develop this? How come I never heard about it?\"He looked at the app named \"Underworld Energy Detector\" on the phone. The app displayed Chen Siyu's picture. Her back and part of her side were of a slightly darker color than everywhere else, and the according stats were displayed on the side. The bottom of the page even had a little square with the a.n.a.lysis of the numbers and a comprehensive luck score.Previously when Kang Jin and the others captured the female ghost that had been hara.s.sing Li Tiantian, they mentioned that they had found a certain amount of \"ghostly energy\" on Li Tiantian. Thus, Yu Zhengdu learned that when humans and creatures of the Underworld came into contact, Underworld energy would more or less be left on them. This Underworld energy could disturb a human's mental state, causing them to unknowingly become confused. To take it a step further, the energy could also change one's luck for a limited period of time.He was inspired by this, and on the side of developing the Life and Death Accounts, came into contact with some 'special technology\" not belonging to the mortal realm. Thus, he made this little program along the way.He had just developed it for fun, and so never brought it up with Shang Que. He didn't imagine that he would have a use for it today.Yu Zhengdu answered, \"I just wanted to try it. It's still in the test phase now. How accurate were the results?\"Shang Que nodded. \"Pretty accurate. She's fine, because she was only in the vicinity. The true unlucky person is someone in her family.\"Chen Siyu was completely shocked by this. She had never told Li Tiantian that there was something wrong with someone in her family.She bit her lip and twisted in place awkwardly before saying, \"Um, are you still selling those stones?\"Shang Que glanced at her coldly. \"For double the price.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\"Boss's vengeful heart\u2026\u2026Li Tiantian: \"\u2026\u2026\"Who raised the price so directly these days?She was just about to ask Yu Zhengdu for help, when Chen Siyu said softly, \"I'll pay it.\"Update a little early this week~ Also, vote for CG's first giveaway event!

    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLi Tiantian stared at her best friend in shock. This plot was developing a bit too fast for her to keep up with. She subtly tugged at Chen Siyu and whispered, \"Ey, isn't that a little unnecessary?\"Li Tiantian had ultimately received a higher education. Though she constantly liked to talk about astrology and such, she didn't truly believe in superst.i.tions. At least, she wasn't obsessed enough to accept someone raising the price right in front of her.Only to see Chen Siyu bite her lip and say, \"You don't know this, but my dad really hasn't been in great shape recently\u2026\u2026\"Li Tiantian didn't imagine this would happen, so made a sudden noise of surprise.Chen Siyu's family situation was a bit complex. Her mother pa.s.sed away early on, and her father remarried after. Her stepmother even gave birth to a son. Her relations.h.i.+p with her stepmother and younger brother wasn't so great, but her father had always doted on her.It wasn't too much to say that the only person she was truly close with in her family was her dad; he was also the most important person in her life.But in the past two months, her dad suddenly seemed to have terrible luck. Several things went wrong with his business, causing him to lose a lot of money. Perhaps due to this, his health was also taking a rapid downturn. He spent his time in and out of the hospital, but the hospital couldn't determine what was wrong either, only saying that he had an insufficiency in blood and Qi.Chen Siyu could only watch her father's condition get worse day by day, but couldn't do anything about it. This obviously stressed her out. These days, she had to split her time between working and caring for her father, so became exceptionally busy. This caused her own health to decline too.At first she was unconvinced by Li Tiantian's suggestion, indifferent about this small company with its luck-changing magnets and luck a.n.a.lyses. But another reason was that she knew her condition was a result of her family situation. It wasn't out of the blue, so she naturally thought that this company was trying to fool her.But what she didn't expect, was that this boss with his nasty att.i.tude would open his mouth and hit the nail straight on the head.Because of her family, she rarely spoke up about her home life. She had never even said anything to anyone about her father's situation.Yet Shang Que could so confidently state that there was something wrong with someone in her family. Just for this, even if he was guessing, she wanted to give them a chance.Because of the unpleasant atmosphere, Chen Siyu more or less felt awkward now, but still braced for the worst and asked, \"May I ask, how did you know that someone in my family wasn't doing so well recently?\"Shang Que looked at her calmly. \"Not 'recently'. It started two months ago.\"Chen Siyu was truly surprised this time. She stared at Shang Que with wide eyes, the words stumbling out of her mouth, \"How, how come you know that too?\"After hearing their exchange Li Tiantian was mindblown. \"No way? Is it true?\"Yu Zhengdu chose this time to display his mysterious smile and insert a small advertis.e.m.e.nt for their company. \"We already told you, we're professionals.\"Shang Que had accurately described Chen Siyu's family situation in only a couple of sentences. No matter how he had done it, Chen Siyu definitely wanted to give them a chance.But now that she wanted to buy the magnets, Yu Zhengdu refused to sell them to her so casually. His excuse was that their company worked professionally in health and magnet management, and each magnet had to be uniquely matched to each person, so they needed to see her father's condition personally before deciding which stone to sell her.As for the real reason, it was that their pebbles had no true use. What actually worked was Underworld technology.At a time like this Chen Siyu obviously didn't dare to have any objections. She immediately cancelled her afternoon schedules and personally drove them to her house.Li Tiantian watched as her originally reluctant best friend suddenly became even more fanatical than herself, suddenly speechless. She secretly took a picture of Chen Siyu and the small company, then uploaded it to their group chat.Li Tiantian:\u3010This morning Siyu was still reluctant to come and buy a magnet with me. Now she directly invited the ones selling the magnets to her house\u2026\u2026\u3011She had previously shown off that pebble quite a few times in this chat. Everyone in the chat had more or less made fun of her for it, and among them Chen Siyu had said the meanest things. Thus, as soon as they received her message, the group chat immediately went:\u3010\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u3011Friend A:\u3010\u2026\u2026Siyu, if you've been kidnapped, press 1\u3011Friend B:\u3010Li Tiantian what did you do to Siyu!\u3011Friend C:\u3010My G.o.d, Tiantian successfully turned Siyu into her lower line?\u3011Friend C:\u3010Tiantian wake up, pyramid schemes are dangerous!\u3011Li Tiantian:\u3010\u2026\u2026\u3011Without Chen Siyu's permission, Li Tiantian didn't feel comfortable sharing her family situation. She could only watch as the theories in the chat became more and more wild, then angrily head back to work.Chen Siyu's house was located locally, in a neighborhood famous for its rich residents. Supposedly, the average price was over 100,000 RMB; each house had its own independent garden. Upon reaching the door, they were even greeted by a maid.Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que got out of the car, only to see Chen Siyu looking in the direction of the parking garage. There were four cars parked there, so she asked the maid, \"Do we have guests over today?\"The maid responded, \"A religious master is here. Sijie invited him over from Diyang. They say he's here to perform an exorcism for Sir.\"Chen Siyu's expression immediately darkened. Chen Sijie was her half brother. The two had an okay relations.h.i.+p, but because their stepmother often spoke ill of her behind Siyu's back, their relations.h.i.+p had gotten worse in the past few years.Chen Siyu scolded, \"Bulls.h.i.+t. Are they trying to say Dad saw a ghost or ran into a demon? What year is it; how are they still so superst.i.tious.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\"Sigh.The trio had just stepped inside when they heard the sound of conversation coming from the hallway leading to the living room.\"Master, please take a look here.\" A middle-aged man who looked quite frail walked over first, making an inviting gesture.\"Dad.\" Chen Siyu rushed over to hold his arm.Father Chen was a bit surprised. \"Siyu, how come you're home so early today?\"Chen Siyu said, \"I especially invited someone to come see you.\"As soon as she finished speaking, the young man who had walked out behind Father Chen mocked, \"Where is the doctor from this time? So many have come, but I still don't see Dad's situation getting better. You should just stop wasting Dad's time.\"This person was exactly Chen Siyu's younger brother, Chen Sijie.There were two more people next to Chen Sijie, but they were dressed as Daoist monks.The one in front looked to be around 60; he was of slender build and had a greyish white beard, but seemed in great health. He truly appeared to be quite sagely and enlightened.The one behind was very young, only about 20. It was likely he was the old Daoist's apprentice.\"From what I think, Dad isn't sick at all.\" Chen Sijie glanced at the old Daoist, his tone pleased, \"This is Daoist priest Mu, who I specially invited from Qinglian Temple. Daoist priest Mu just took a look at Dad's situation and said that Dad is being hara.s.sed by some adverse beings. Hurry and tell your doctors to leave.\"Chen Siyu answered back scornfully. \"Who told you that I invited doctors over?\"\"They're not doctors?\" Chen Sijie looked at her in suspicion. \"Then who are they?\"It wasn't possible that she also invited a religious master back. His older sister had attended school overseas and was the most disbelieving of such things.\"They\u2026\u2026\" Chen Siyu turned around to take a glance at Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que, but couldn't think of an introduction for them on the spot.Yu Zhengdu stepped up just in time, nodding to all who were there. He spoke with the hint of a smile, \"h.e.l.lo everyone. Our company works in health management.\"Everyone present: \"\u2026\u2026\"Chen Sijie instantly burst out into laughter. He looked at Chen Siyu, \"Please don't tell me you plan on having dad eat healthcare products?\"Daoist priest Mu told Father Chen too, \"Householder Chen, I'm about to open the altar and cast spells. It's best that unrelated persons aren't present, or they could become accidentally hurt.\"Father Chen looked at his daughter a little awkwardly. \"Siyu, Daoist priest Mu is the head priest of Qinglian Temple. Sijie worked very hard to invite him. How about you ask your guests to leave first, we'll pay for their transportation costs.\"Upon hearing this Chen Sijie looked at Chen Siyu, satisfied.Chen Siyu was immediately unimpressed. \"Dad, Mr. Shang and Xiao Yu are professionals. Let them take a look for you.\"Daoist priest Mu stroked his sleeve and told Chen Siyu, \"Miss Chen, your father's situation is not due to health-related causes. Your supposed health management cannot solve his problem and will only waste time. I recommend you don't continue with this.\"Chen Sijie followed up with: \"You hear what the master says?\"Chen Siyu was humiliated by this. Her entire face was red from anger, yet she had nothing to say in response.At this time, Shang Que lifted his gaze and asked, \"What era is it? How come Daoists still haven't advanced? Still acting like the fools they've been since imperial times.\"Chen Sijie promptly became outraged. \"Watch your words!\"The little Daoist behind Daoist priest Mu was also a bit angry, and stepped forward to argue.On the contrary, Daoist priest Mu didn't seem angry at all. He signaled for his apprentice to step back and bowed politely to Shang Que. He replied, \"This householder, I know that due to the influence of new age teachings, you believe in science and not ghosts or G.o.ds. But, this world is so vast; there will undoubtedly be things that humans cannot completely understand, especially things dealing with the Underworld and mortal realm. Since historical times till now, it's been several thousands of years, so we know these aren't new superst.i.tions. Just because humans can't touch it, doesn't mean it's nonexistent.\"\"I advise you to believe that there is, rather than believe that there isn't.\"Daoist priest Mu remained unbothered. His voice was loud and clear, he didn't speak for long, but everyone who heard was astounded. Even Chen Siyu couldn't help but feel a sense of trust towards him.Father Chen lowered his body in a bow, respectfully saying, \"Master is right.\"Chen Sijie was even more pleased and made to denounce Shang Que.Only to see Shang Que's expression turn disdainful. He spoke apathetically, \"Who said I don't believe in ghosts and G.o.ds? I'm just saying that it's been so long, yet you Daoists have rested on your laurels, not making any technological advancements at all.\"Daoist priest Mu: \"????\"Everyone else: \"????\"The words got caught in Chen Sijie's throat. He stared at Shang Que, bewildered, and then turned to gape at Chen Siyu.Chen Siyu was also very perplexed, turning around to look at Shang Que.Don't you guys work with luck-changing magnets?Daoist priest Mu couldn't help but inquire, \"May I ask this householder, what you mean by technological advancements\u2026\u2026\"Shang Que: \"Even after all these years, you still need to open the altar and cast spells to remove evil. No wonder people say you are feudal.\"Daoist priest Mu suddenly felt that he had been lied to. His blank expression quivered for a brief moment. His apprentice, however, completely lost his temper. He took a step forward to say, \"Are you joking? Without opening the altar and casting spells how will you remove evil? These skills have been pa.s.sed down thousands of years from our ancestors. Don't use feudal as an excuse\u2026\u2026\"This time Shang Que didn't hide his despise. \"If it's already been pa.s.sed down for thousands of years, how is that still not feudal? Back in the day when they destroyed the Four Olds, they were aiming to destroy those like you.\"The Daoist became p.i.s.sed.Chen Sijie became p.i.s.sed too.Father Chen was terrified his son and daughter would start fighting in public, so urgently tried to mediate. \"Friend, you can't say it like that\u2026\u2026\"Only to see Shang Que tug at Yu Zhengdu. \"Take out our program. Show these Daoists some modern technology.\"Father Chen didn't get to finish his sentence, so looked at him, bewildered, \"Ah? What new technology?\"Shang Que hummed lightly, features becoming arrogant. \"The Underworld Energy Detector: using the latest technology to determine the probability of you running into something evil.\"Everyone present: \"\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\"Boss, can you at least round out your words\u2026\u2026Early update again this week! Because they might shut the power off tomorrow due to strong winds, so I don't want to miss the update in case they do and I have no wifi QQ Also, my eyes have been really dry recently because of the winds and this makes staring at the computer screen to translate really difficult.

    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs soon as Shang Que spoke, everyone present became completely confused. A moment later, Chen Sijie snorted, \"Where did this maniac come from?\"The little Daoist's face was red with anger. He also used an irate tone to ask Father Chen, \"Householder Chen, what does your family mean by this?\"Daoist priest Mu bowed towards Father Chen too. \"Householder Chen, from its founding until now, Qinglian Temple has had a legacy of over one thousand years; our skills are pa.s.sed down from generation to generation. Regardless if the skill in question is spell casting or ritual performing, we have always lived up to our reputation. This time we specially came from Diyang because we saw young Householder Chen's sincerity. If you don't believe in my abilities, then I will leave immediately.\"Chen Sijie heard this and became anxious. He told his father, \"Dad, Daoist priest Mu is a famous enlightened man in the Diyang area. So many people wait in line to try and invite him but fail, you can't let jiejie fool around like this.\"Father Chen was innocent, he didn't even understand what Shang Que just said. He urgently apologized, \"Priest, you're mistaken. I don't mean that I don't trust you.\"Chen Sijie turned his head to shoo Shang Que and Yu Zhengdu. \"Where are you scammers from, hurry and go back to where you came from.\"Chen Siyu refused to let her brother have his way. If the people she brought today left just like this, then her reliable image in her father's heart would forever be tarnished. She urgently peeked at Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que, hoping they would express their skills.Only to see Shang Que glance at her and say coldly, \"With this kind of att.i.tude, if you want our company to help you, we're going to have to raise the price.\"Chen Siyu: \"\u2026\u2026\"Everyone present: \"\u2026\u2026\"Chen Siyu had never regretted anything so much in her life. She only placed her trust in them because this company seemed to have some actual abilities. But who knew that this little boss completely sucked at reading the atmosphere? Now she had lost her face completely in front of her little brother.Yu Zhengdu couldn't help but look at his boss with admiration. As expected from the Ghost King, still daring to raise the price on the spot even in this situation. But he was scared that if he continued to give Boss free reign, they would get kicked out of the house, so quickly mediated, \"There's no need to get so excited. We're not saying the priest is a scammer, just that everyone's technology is different.\"The little Daoist was so angry he laughed. He disregarded his master, who was trying to stop him, and stepped forward to say, \"Do you even understand the situation? We work in removing evil and keeping away misfortune. We deal with creatures of the Underworld. This isn't something your tomfoolery can handle. If you don't leave soon, don't blame me when you accidentally get trapped in all this\u2026\u2026\"As he spoke, Yu Zhengdu pulled out his phone and opened the app to scan Father Chen. \"Priest you've misunderstood us. We work in removing evil and catching ghosts too\u2026\u2026\"The little Daoist saw that he took his phone out and became even angrier. \"What? Are you going to use your phone to take pictures for the ghosts and spirits?\"As soon as he finished, Yu Zhengdu lightly sucked in a breath. He looked at Father Chen in surprise, \"Mr. Chen, is your left arm okay?\"Upon hearing this, Father Chen's expression subtly changed. His tone of voice became strange. \"Why do you ask that?\"Yu Zhengdu looked at the app and said, \"According to the results from our detector, your entire body is covered in Underworld energy. Recently you should've felt cold s.h.i.+vers in your whole body, more seriously on the left side. Especially your left hand\u2026\u2026\"His eyebrows slightly furrowed. \"It must be hard to even hold things.\"Father Chen had been a little suspicious, but after hearing him speak he immediately became alert. He responded quickly, \"That's exactly right. It's exactly like that.\"He quickly crossed over to Yu Zhengdu's side and peeked at the phone. \"What technology is this? How come you know my situation from just scanning?\"He saw on the phone's screen an image of his own body. The entire thing seemed to be covered in black, some areas darker and some lighter. Different areas also had corresponding stats.Yu Zhengdu pointed to those stats and explained to him, \"Your body has been consumed by Underworld energy, which is why you feel cold. These areas with darker colors and higher numbers are where the presence of Underworld energy is strongest; they're also where you feel the most uncomfortable.\"The more Father Chen looked at it the wider his eyes got. On his face was an expression of disbelief. \"That's amazing. These places, exactly these, that's where I'm most uncomfortable. The hospital couldn't even figure it out, how did you guys do it?\"\"This is patented technology. It's a secret.\" Yu Zhengdu smiled. \"The chills caused by Underworld energy are not actually considered a disease, so before they cause any physical harm, hospitals can't detect them.\"Father Chen looked at the app in wonder. For a brief moment, he forgot about Daoist priest Mu and his apprentice's presence.Chen Sijie watched as his father's att.i.tude towards the two scammers changed right in front of his eyes, shocked. He protested, \"Dad, don't let those scammers fool you.\"Father Chen glared at him. \"How is this a scam? Do you know how accurate their results are?\"Chen Siyu: \u2026\u2026Of course not.Daoist priest Mu was a bit surprised too. He furrowed his brows and stated, \"I started learning Daoist ways from age 8. Up till now, it's been 50 years. I have seen innumerous Underworld creatures, but have never heard that you can detect and a.n.a.lyze Underworld energy.\"Shang Que's face remained expressionless, but his words were, as usual, mocking. \"Why else would I say you've rested on your laurels?\"Daoist priest Mu could hold himself back, but his apprentice couldn't. The little Daoist immediately spoke up, \"Don't think you can make up a pretty excuse. I've seen plenty of scammers like you, randomly using any apparatus and saying it's fancy technology. You're just silver-tongued and have good luck, coincidentally coming up with the right lie.\"He scoffed. \"In the end, you still just want to sell your healthcare products and treatment apparatus.\"\"That's not it\u2026\u2026\" Yu Zhengdu was a bit timid as he spoke. \"We can also remove evil and catch ghosts\u2026\u2026\"\"You can my\u2026\u2026 What?\" The little Daoist was just in the middle of his righteous speech when he got interrupted. He suddenly widened his eyes. \"You guys catch ghosts?\"Even Chen Siyu, who had invited them over, was shocked. Wait, this wasn't how she imagined the plot was going to roll out in her head. She reflexively asked, \"Xiao Yu, I thought you just sold luck-changing magnets?\"The little Daoist understood everything the moment after Chen Siyu spoke. These two scammers were just trying to sell some fake items, but coincidentally ran into him and his master, both who had real skills. Their original routine no longer worked, so they had started making up bigger bluffs on the spot.After getting this, the little Daoist calmed down quite a bit. He a.s.sumed a serious expression and inquired, \"You guys can catch ghosts too? How?\"Shang Que lazily stated, \"With our hands.\"Everyone present: \"\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\" When we get back I need to discuss with Boss the proper way to communicate when trying to do business!Daoist priest Mu sighed, \"What a farce.\"The little Daoist glared at Father Chen angrily, \"Householder Chen, if you believe these scammers then we'll leave right now. You can have them help you remove evil and catch ghosts.\"\"Ey, there's no need for that. Little priest please don't say that.\" Father Chen was a little panicked. Even though these two young men had very fancy technology, they really didn't seem trustworthy. In matters regarding evil spirits, he felt more at peace trusting an actual Daoist monk. He hurriedly stepped up to Daoist priest Mu and bowed, saying, \"I'd like to please ask the priest to open the altar and cast some spells to help me remove the evil spirit.\"After seeing that his father ultimately chose the religious master he had brought back, Chen Sijie sighed in relief, then turned around, satisfied, to shoot a taunting look at Chen Siyu.At this point in time, Chen Siyu was more exasperated than mad. Even she herself felt that the two people she had invited over were too imaginative and reckless with their ideas.Father Chen looked at Yu Zhengdu again. \"Little brother, your technology is truly impressive, but for things involving magic, it's best for a priest to do it. How about this, I'll have Siyu send you back first, but we'll still pay the full price\u2026\u2026\"Father Chen's att.i.tude rubbed Shang Que the right way. He spared a look at him, and said, \"We're more professional than these old Daoists when it comes to catching ghosts.\"Daoist priest Mu: \"\u2026\u2026\"Father Chen started sweating. He was about to start persuading again, when the fiery young Daoist finally had enough. He rushed forward to say, \"Fine, then you guys stay to watch us open the altar and cast spells. When we've guided the evil spirit to the altar, you can show us what you've got.\"Daoist priest Mu's expression hardened. \"Yuanqing, no monkey business.\"At the same time, Shang Que casually agreed, \"Alright.\"The situation had already escalated to a point where Father Chen couldn't say anything either. These two groups of people were determined to decide who was better.Under Father Chen's direction, the serving staff soon prepared all the appropriate items, setting up the incense table and sacrificial altar.After eating dinner, Daoist priest Mu went to sit in front of the altar and meditate by himself. The little Daoist became busy, taking out a trunk from their car and retrieving the magical instruments, yellow talismans, and other items they had brought from the temple. He even took out a tiny, antique incense burner that was filled halfway with ash.The little Daoist arrogantly glanced at Shang Que. \"This is incense ash from our temple. It is enshrined year-round before Enlightened Man Zhang's seat and can be used for removing evil and protecting homes.\"Not only did the incense ash have a backstory, each item he took out seemed old and important. It was obvious they were all famous pieces with long histories. Qinglian Temple certainly lived up to its reputation.Shang Que sat on the couch and played his mobile game, completely ignoring the little Daoist's taunts.Chen Sijie took the opportunity to mock and sneer at his sister. \"Jiejie, you never believed in these feudal superst.i.tions before. How come now that you've started being superst.i.tious, you're worse than me? What kind of people have you invited?\"Chen Siyu had nothing to say, keeping her head low and prepping a cup of coffee.Chen Sijie rarely beat his sister in anything. His smile was about to reach the back of his head, but he still felt it wasn't enough, so went over to taunt Yu Zhengdu.\"What equipment does your company have? You're not really planning on catching a ghost with your bare hands, are you?\"Yu Zhengdu pondered momentarily and answered, \"We have equipment too\u2026\u2026\"Chen Sijie was just about to ask more questions, when the little Daoist finished his preparations and said, \"We're starting. All unrelated persons, please don't be disruptive.\"Father Chen was the most nervous person present. He immediately told Chen Sijie, \"Quiet, everyone be quiet.\"Daoist priest Mu stood up and retrieved a peach wood sword from the incense table. He began to make finger gestures as he chanted and cast spells.His voice was low, causing the listeners' moods to fluctuate. But if you listened closely, you could hear a disharmonious sound\u2014\u2014coming from Shang Que's mobile game.Chen Sijie couldn't help rolling his eyes. Even Chen Siyu had mixed feelings.Yu Zhengdu leaned closer to Boss and whispered, \"Boss, give the mortals some respect.\"Shang Que glanced at him briefly, then reluctantly put his phone away. \"Only on your behalf.\"At this time, a gust of cold wind suddenly blew in; it didn't blow in from the door or windows, but instead from the direction of the ceiling. Several candles flickered on the incense table.Everybody instinctively looked up, only to see the crystal chandelier hanging from the ceiling was shaking too, causing the lighting to sometimes be bright and sometimes be dark. This raised uncertainty in their hearts.The cold wind did so even more. The lights flickered and the cold seemed to be capable of seeping into one's bones. Yu Zhengdu urgently pulled his clothes tighter around himself.The yellow talismans on the table fluttered in the wind, and the Chens were practically huddled together in a group hug. Daoist priest Mu was unbothered. He solemnly picked up a handful of rice and threw it on the ground, chanting, \"Whether you are in the poor heavens, or travel through the Underworld, I am searching for a deceased spirit, come forth to my altar\u2026\u2026\"Everyone looked at the ground, only to see the grains of rice didn't stop moving after landing. Instead, they started rolling around slightly.Father Chen's voice was shaking, \"Why is the rice moving?\"The little Daoist clutched a yellow talisman in his hand. His expression was severe as he waited to the side. Upon hearing this question, he answered, \"The mortal eye cannot see spirits. We must utilize other objects and observe their movements\u2026\u2026\"Father Chen almost pa.s.sed out. \"This, this\u2026\u2026 Is it because the ghost has appeared?\"The little Daoist had no time to respond to him. Daoist priest Mu was already holding his sword and walking in a circle around the moving grains of rice. His chanting didn't stop, and beads of sweat emerged on his forehead. It was obvious that this was the climax of the spell-casting.Chen Sijie was scared but also a bit excited. The scene before their eyes was proving that Daoist priest Mu, who he had invited, was truly a religious master. He finally couldn't help himself, taking this opportunity to mock Yu Zhengdu, \"Didn't you say you wanted to capture the ghost? How about trying now?\"He finished speaking but found that Yu Zhengdu didn't respond. He thought it was because the other was frightened, but upon turning his head to look, he saw that Yu Zhengdu was intently staring in Daoist priest Mu's direction. But unlike them, there was no hint of fear on Yu Zhengdu's face, but instead a look of great curiosity.The reason Yu Zhengdu's face looked like that was mainly because what he was seeing differed from what the others were seeing.Since the cold wind had blown in, the terrifying and mysterious situation was portrayed clearly in front of his eyes.As Daoist priest Mu's spell-casting began, a man's spirit slowly fell through the ceiling and landed in front of the altar.What surprised Yu Zhengdu, though, was that the man's appearance was not one an evil ghost should have at all. His posture was straight and he wore an ironed suit; his hair was very short. He was clearly an urban elite.The man seemed to be under Daoist priest Mu's control. His body was stiff, but he still had energy to spare as he carefully avoided the priest's sword and faced off with him.Yu Zhengdu softly asked Shang Que, \"What's up with this ghost?\"Shang Que glanced over. \"It seems to be under someone's control. The other party probably felt the old priest's activities, so the two are currently duelling it out.\"Yu Zhengdu went \"ah\" and said, \"A situation like this exists!\"At this time, the man dressed as an elite suddenly became alert. He held his hand out a tad and blocked Daoist priest Mu's peach wood sword, then used this brief pause to fly across the room.In certain people's eyes, this appeared as though the heavy wooden peach sword in Daoist priest Mu's hand had suddenly flicked to the side by itself. The priest yelled loudly, and the s.h.i.+fting grains of rice finally came to a standstill.Father Chen's heart had almost stopped beating. He asked weakly, \"Did you catch, catch the ghost?\"Daoist priest Mu looked apologetic. \"It escaped.\"Father Chen's face became pale, only to see Daoist priest Mu wave his hand. \"Don't worry, let me cast some spells again\u2026\u2026\"\"Let us do it. By the time you're finished, it'll already be sunrise,\" Shang Que said as he glanced at Yu Zhengdu.Yu Zhengdu immediately understood his boss's meaning. The ghost was too lowly; he wasn't to be bothered personally catching it.Daoist priest Mu said very seriously, \"Working with magic has never been easy. One night is nothing, I have cast spells for 3 days and 3 nights before\u2026\u2026\"He wasn't done talking, but Yu Zhengdu had already pulled out something silver from his pockets. He stood up solemnly. \"I'll do it.\"Everyone focused on the object, only to see that the item swinging from his hands was\u2026\u2026a pair of handcuffs.Daoist priest Mu almost spat out a mouthful of blood. He finally exploded, \"This is complete blasphemy\u2014\u2014\"Yu Zhengdu knew that he couldn't explain the truth to them, so decided it was best to just end this as quickly as possible. Thus, he ignored the priest and charged at the male ghost.The male ghost knew how humans determined a ghost's movement in the mortal realm, so after leaving the vicinity of the rice, he calmed down. He had just started resting when he saw the young man dressed in a sweats.h.i.+rt, who looked like a homebody, suddenly charge at him.At first the male ghost was a bit confused. He thought the human was just playing, only realizing what was going on when Yu Zhengdu appeared right in front of him. Then, he took off running.Yu Zhengdu shouted, \"Stop running! You're under arrest! Squat facing the wall with your hands on your head. Male ghosts on the left, female ghosts on the right\u2014\u2014\"Everyone present: \"\u2026\u2026\"Chen Sijie started jumping in place. \"Jie, are you trying to kill Dad!\"Daoist priest Mu was so angry he couldn't even hold his sword straight. He placed a hand over his chest as he panted, \"What a mess\u2026\u2026This is too, too much of a mess\u2026\u2026\"He didn't get to finish speaking, only to hear a sound of \"keng\u2014\u2014\". The tiny incense burner that the little Daoist was so proud of had been accidentally knocked over by Yu Zhengdu. The ashes that had been enshrined in front of Enlightened Man Zhang fell out and were scattered on the ground, spreading throughout the room as a cold gust of wind pa.s.sed.The little Daoist was as angry as could be. He yelled loudly, \"I've had enough of you\u2014\u2014\"At the same time, Shang Que faintly pointed his finger ahead. Yu Zhengdu stopped running when he reached the place Shang Que pointed to, then sighed in relief. \"f.u.c.k, he's a runner. I'm so tired!\"He used one hand to grab something, and the other to snap on the handcuffs. Then, he pushed at the air and said, \"Finally caught it.\"The little Daoist's eyes were blood red. \"You dare to lie!\"He finished speaking, only to see two footprints appear amid the incense ash in the area where Yu Zhengdu had just pushed. In between the two footprints was also the imprint of a pair of handcuffs.Everyone immediately paused. Daoist priest Mu had even stopped breathing.Chen Sijie's eyeb.a.l.l.s almost popped out of his sockets. He stammered, \"What, what is this?\"\"Ah, right.\" Yu Zhengdu lifted his head to look at him. \"You just asked me about it, this is the equipment we use to catch ghosts.\"He smiled, \"Even though it's not the same as the priest's, but to each their own, right.\"Everyone: \"\u2026\u2026\"To each their own my a.s.s!Thank you for everyone's kind words and advice last week! They ended up not shutting off the power (thankfully, cause I would've died with no WIFI), but LA did catch on fire over the weekend (n.o.body was hurt).I listened to y'all and bought a humidifier and 2 in 1 warm/cold compress and have been religiously using both. My eyes are feeling better! But my wallet is crying LOLI also started translating a new short novel called Outside the Law. It's about gangsters in love, so if you're interested, go check it out~ There are only 15 chapters and I'm updating 4x a week, so it'll be done pretty soon.Will update again tomorrow~Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayPeople in the past would use dust to detect the tracks of ghosts when they came back. The supposed \"coming back\" referred to the day when the spirits of the deceased would return to visit. Some families who had deceased members would place fine dust on the counter during the day of return to see the tracks of the spirit.According to legend, one could tell what the deceased what reincarnate into in the next life based on the tracks left in the dirt. If one saw chicken tracks, then they would reincarnate into a chicken; if one saw dog tracks, they would reincarnate into a dog. There was an even more bizarre saying, that if there were chain imprints in the dust, the deceased had committed too many sins when alive and had returned in chains.Daoist priest Mu naturally knew of all this. Sometimes, more traditional families would even invite him to perform spirit send-offs, but he had never truly seen a ghost's imprint before.He never imagined that his first time witnessing it would be under these circ.u.mstances. Beyond that, he never imagined that the imprints he would see were those of handcuffs\u2026\u2026 But he had to admit, it truly was on par with the times.Daoist priest Mu's eyes filled with a confusion that seemed to read, \"Who am I, where am I.\" He temporarily became speechless.His apprentice simply became mute.Everyone looked in the direction of the footprints, only to see a pair of handcuffs floating in the air, directly in line with the prints in the dust.Father Chen was shaking in fear. He finally gathered the courage to ask, \"Did you catch the g-ghost?\"\"Yes.\" Yu Zhengdu looked at the Chens who were now in a huddle together. He comforted, \"You guys can relax, it's fine now.\"How could they relax, the handcuffs were still in midair.Probably because he thought huddling in a group wasn't a pretty image, Father Chen stood up, though he was still terrified at heart. When he was a certain distance away from the handcuffs, he stopped and started peering, as if he wanted to get a closer look but was also very scared he would get hurt. He asked, \"How did you catch it?\"As soon as he asked, Daoist priest Mu and his apprentice looked over too, intense curiosity burning in their eyes.How would he know. Yu Zhengdu looked at Boss to seek help.Shang Que said, \"There are many magical instruments capable of holding ghosts. A chain is one of them. The old Daoist should know this.\"The method of using dust to detect trails did note that sometimes the deceased returned in chains. Those were, of course, instruments of the Underworld. But in the mortal realm, some Daoists also preferred to use chains as their magical instruments, refining them to be able to hold ghosts.Thus, Daoist priest Mu nodded his head.Shang Que looked at him in disdain, \"So how come now that I've changed its form, you don't recognize?\"Daoist priest Mu: \"\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026??\"Was your method as simple as switching a magical instrument? Your entire ghost catching process was too unscientific\u2026\u2026oh wait, too scientific, okay!!! Is this how someone who works with superst.i.tions should act?!Daoist priest Mu wanted to argue, but Father Chen already seemed to understand. \"So that's what happened, I see. This is one of your new inventions too, right. Handcuffs are more convenient than chains.\"He gave them a thumbs up and kept praising, \"Truly, the times are changing. Even the technology for removing evil and catching ghosts has become so top-notch. Kudos to the youth.\"Daoist priest Mu choked.Little Daoist: \"\u2026\u2026\" He was a youth too!Father Chen asked again, \"So what are you going to do with this ghost?\"What to do with it\u2026\u2026 Well, the company normally beat up ghosts that broke the law and then incarcerated them, but he probably couldn't directly say that.Upon seeing his hesitation, Daoist priest Mu cut in, \"Naturally, we'll help him move on.\"This was part of the normal execution process. Father Chen had never eaten pork, but he had seen pigs run before. He nodded his head too, \"Oh, yes. We must help him move on.\"Then we'll take him back and pretend we're going to help him move on, Yu Zhengdu thought. He was about to say something in response, when the handcuffed ghost suddenly started crying, \"Don't, don't make me move on. I still have things I haven't accomplished\u2026\u2026\"n.o.body at the scene could hear the ghost crying except Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que. They only felt that the room had dropped a couple of degrees in temperature again. The Chen siblings were still holding onto each other, only for Chen Sijie to scream and ask, \"Why is it so cold, did the ghost escape again?\"\"No, he's just a little agitated,\" Yu Zhengdu explained, and then imitated how his coworkers questioned criminal ghosts. He put his hands on his hips and yelled, \"Now you feel regret? Why didn't you think of this when you started doing evil?\"The Chens were originally terrified, but upon seeing Yu Zhengdu scold the air, they went: \"\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu waved his fist in the air. \"Ghosts like you who have done wrong are in no position to bargain. You should be grateful we haven't beaten you up yet!\"Everyone: \"\u2026\u2026\"While everyone was still confused, Yu Zhengdu suddenly turned his head back and looked at Father Chen strangely. \"Mr. Chen, this ghost says he wants to speak with you.\"Father Chen's neck muscles tightened. \"What do you mean speak? What does this ghost want to do to me?\"Yu Zhengdu: \"He says he's your friend.\"Father Chen immediately waved his hands. \"Bulls.h.i.+t. Where would I find a ghost to be my friend?\"Yu Zhengdu crossed his arms in front of his chest. \"He said his name is Hao Wentao.\"Father Chen was stunned. \"What?\"After hearing this, Chen Siyu and Chen Sijie looked at each other and finally let go. The fear on their faces was replaced with confusion. Chen Siyu was quite disbelieving: \"Uncle Wentao?\"Father Chen really did have a friend called Hao Wentao. He was an a.s.sociate at a private law firm, and exceptionally good at his work. He was also often busy, always staying up late to work overtime. Eventually, he unfortunately pa.s.sed away due to overworking himself, half a year ago.Because it had been a while since the incident, Father Chen couldn't react in time. He asked numbly a moment later, \"Is it really Wentao?\"Yu Zhengdu thought about it and then said, \"How would I know. I don't recognize him\u2026\u2026\"Father Chen briefly pondered, then declared sternly, \"It can't possibly be Wentao. Wentao was my good friend, he wouldn't harm me. This ghost is lying!\"Yu Zhengdu looked at the ghost. The ghost had become frantic, waving its arms around. \"I really am Hao Wentao, I'm not lying.\"Father Chen watched as the handcuffs moved up and down, clinking with the movements. He felt growing apprehension.Yu Zhengdu thought about it, then took out his phone and said, \"Let me try this.\"This phone was given to him by the company and contained Luofeng's \"patented technology.\" Perhaps it really could image the ghost.He opened the camera and pointed the lens in the direction of the male ghost, then laughed. \"It really works. Mr. Chen, come see. Is it him?\"Father Chen was perplexed, and carefully s.h.i.+fted over to look at the screen of Yu Zhengdu's phone. His eyes widened. \"\u2026\u2026Wentao, it really is you!\"Upon hearing this, the Chen siblings and two Daoist monks all rushed over to take a look at the phone.And then everyone simultaneously: \"\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\"They saw the blurry figure of a man on Yu Zhengdu's phone. The man looked quite capable and wore a suit, along with the handcuffs around his wrists.Everybody instinctively turned to look in the direction the camera was pointing. There was very obviously nothing there, only a pair of floating handcuffs.After the initial shock, everyone's reaction was different. The Chen siblings looked very perplexed. \"It's really Uncle Wentao?\"On the other hand, the two Daoist monks seemed to be questioning their existence, especially the little Daoist. He had originally been so shocked that he remained silent for a long time. Now, the expression on his face shattered and he looked at Daoist priest Mu not knowing whether he should laugh or cry. \"Master, they really used the phone to take a picture of the ghost\u2026\u2026\"Just this afternoon when they were arguing, he had used this to mock Yu Zhengdu. He never imagined that the other would actually have this kind of technology\u2026\u2026After confirming that this ghost was truly Hao Wentao, Father Chen immediately became excited. He pointed in the direction the camera was pointing and started yelling, \"Hao Wentao, are you still human? I treated you like my own brother, but you turned around and came to haunt me!\"Yu Zhengdu reminded him, \"He isn't a human anymore!\"Father Chen: \"\u2026\u2026\"In the phone screen, Hao Wentao covered his face. His expression was both ashamed and regretful. \"I didn't want to harm you. I was forced to.\"Father Chen flung his hand. \"Then tell me, how were you forced?\"Hao Wentao cried, \"It's all because of Yaochu's stockholder Liu Ningan. He hired a demon priest who used magic to trap me and forced me to do some evil things for him.\"\"Liu Ningan?\" Father Chen was shocked at his words. Previously he had been competing with Liu Ningan for business, but for some reason, Liu Ningan seemed to always know his bottom line and plans. He always managed to be one step ahead, even setting up a trap to make him lose several deals and money.Now it seemed like this was all because of Hao Wentao.Hao Wentao said, \"At first Liu Ningan wanted to directly take your life, so he could take over your company after. It was I who recommended him to let me stay by your side and spy on you. Then I could tell him all your business secrets so he could slowly take over your clients and business deals. Because murder decreases one's Underworld merits, he followed my suggestion. Otherwise you would be dead by now.\"Father Chen didn't think there was this layer in the middle, and temporarily became shocked. He didn't know what to say anymore.Yu Zhengdu asked with his scientist's mind, \"Then did you normally stand on Mr. Chen's left side to watch him work?\"Hao Wentao paused, \"How did you know?\"Yu Zhengdu slightly smiled. \"Our Underworld Energy Detector detected that the Underworld energy on the left side of Mr. Chen's body was very strong.\"Everyone: \"\u2026\u2026\" What a truly scientific a.n.a.lysis!After learning that Hao Wentao was forced and had also technically saved his life, Father Chen wasn't angry anymore. He only felt a bit sympathetic.Father Chen asked Yu Zhengdu to release Hao Wentao from the handcuffs. Then, the few humans and one ghost sat down to have a long discussion.Father Chen asked Hao Wentao, \"Didn't you die half a year ago? How did you get caught by Liu Ningan?\"As soon as the topic was brought up, Hao Wentao immediately became depressed. He pounded at his chest, saying, \"It was all my own fault\u2026\u2026\"Father Chen watched as he hit his own chest, wanting to stop him but unable to. He hurriedly inquired, \"How was it your own fault?\"Hao Wentao lifted his face as he sighed heavily. \"You know me, in life I was a STEM major\u2026\u2026\"\"I know.\" Father Chen was confused. \"What does that have anything to do with you getting caught?\"Hao Wentao: \"When I was alive, I was a resolute atheist. Not only did I not believe in ghosts or G.o.ds, I always warned my family to only believe in science and to stay far away from superst.i.tions. Under my influence, my wife and daughter both became unwavering materialists\u2026\u2026\"He wiped his face, tone depressed. \"So after I died, they didn't even come once to pay respects to me. After becoming a ghost I had nothing to eat. I went hungry for several months until I finally couldn't stand it and picked up some food that people leave on the streets for wandering ghosts. I didn't expect that food to be purposefully placed there by the demon priest as a trap for wandering ghosts\u2026\u2026\"Everyone: \"\u2026\u2026\"What a tragic story.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn life, Hao Wentao had a glorious track record. Since young, his grades were stellar, and he was socially adept too. He had always been the best among his peers. After graduation, he became a lawyer, and not many years later, with his savings and connections, became the a.s.sociate of his own private law firm. His career and family life were both satisfactory, so he was quite impressive.But who would've imagined, a person like him would end up having no one to bring him offerings in death\u2026\u2026 And it wasn't anyone's fault but his own.When he was alive, Hao Wentao was a firm materialist, scoffing at stories of ghosts and G.o.ds. Not only this, he also strongly valued science in his home, and was against his family members' partic.i.p.ating in superst.i.tious activities. Under his influence, their family was the model scientific family of their neighborhood. Disregarding the normal days, they even refused to prepare offerings during the traditional holidays.This shouldn't have been a big deal, as most dead spirits only stayed in the mortal realm for a short period of time before being notified to reincarnate. So even if no one brought offerings for them, at most they would only go hungry for a brief time.But coincidentally Hao Wentao still had unfulfilled desires; if a ghost didn't let go of their obsessions, they would be unable to reincarnate. Thus, he had to stay in the mortal realm, wandering. If he continued this way, it was likely he would become a lonely and wild ghost.Hao Wentao said sorrowfully, \"After I first died, I spent some time in my home. My wife and daughter cried every day, but just refused to bring me offerings. Sometimes my friends or relatives would come to pay their respects and wanted to bring offerings, but they would stop them. My daughter told everyone, her dad hated these superst.i.tions the most. If he was really watching from the heavens, he definitely wouldn't want anyone to bring him offerings\u2026\u2026\"Everyone: \"\u2026\u2026\"They wanted to comfort him, but didn't know how. His experience was a textbook example of you reap what you sow\u2026\u2026Father Chen thought his old friend was a little tragic. He looked left and right, then turned to inquire Yu Zhengdu, \"Little Mr. Yu, does your company have any ideas on how to help Wentao?\"\"Most likely, yes.\" Yu Zhengdu turned to look at Boss.Shang Que lifted his gaze. \"What desires does he have remaining. Satisfy them and it'll be resolved.\"\"Ah, right right.\" Father Chen looked at Hao Wentao again. \"Wentao, tell me what wishes you have. I'll definitely try and help you fulfill them.\"\"I have two\u2026\u2026\" Hao Wentao looked at Father Chen in grat.i.tude through the phone screen. \"My only wishes were to see my daughter go to college, and then get married and have kids in a happy family, and to travel the world with my wife after she retired, because normally we were both very busy with work\u2026\u2026\"Father Chen: \"\u2026\u2026\"Everyone else: \"\u2026\u2026\"Father Chen paused, then said, \"Your daughter is still in middle school this year right \u2026\u2026\"Hao Wentao nodded.Father Chen: \"Your wife isn't retiring for another 20 years right\u2026\u2026\"Hao Wentao nodded again.Father Chen looked at Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que helplessly. Shang Que was impatient, saying, \"He has too many wishes. Simply exorcise him.\"Exorcism would forcefully remove a ghost's obsessions.\"No no no, don't exorcise me.\" Hao Wentao waved his arms and almost started crying. \"I really want to see my daughter go to college, and my wife\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu thought about it, and said, \"Actually, wouldn't it be easier to just have his family members bring him offerings?\"Father Chen clapped. \"Exactly. I can go convince them.\"Hao Wentao said dejectedly, \"They won't listen to you. They might even try to persuade you to stay far away from superst.i.tions\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu smiled, \"That was in the past. With our company here, how could they not believe.\"Everyone was struck with realization. They had almost forgotten that this company had the advanced technology of imaging ghosts\u2026\u2026Hao Wentao's case was thus resolved, but the true enemy behind the scenes, Liu Ningan, still caused the Chen family great distress. But they had no evidence and couldn't be like him and use wrongful magic to get their revenge. At the same time, they were still scared Liu Ningan had a backup plan, so became extremely torn.Finally, it was Daoist priest Mu who had more experience, and said that in this duel, Liu Ningan's demon priest had technically lost, so Hao Wentao had regained his freedom. The demon priest himself would also get rebounded, so wouldn't be able to cause harm again for a short period of time.Hao Wentao spoke up too, and said that in the time that he had helped Liu Ningan, he had found out quite a few of his and other Yaochu stockholders' business secrets. He would tell these secrets to Father Chen so Father Chen could start retaliating against Liu Ningan.But all this would come later. Yu Zhengdu and them wouldn't partic.i.p.ate in it; this time, they had more than satisfactorily completed their job. Father Chen generously gave both them and Daoist priest Mu and his apprentice a fee for their work. Though n.o.body pointed it out outright, they all knew that there was probably a large difference between the two sums. Other than that, Father Chen had also given each of them a red envelope. This was considered a personal gift that didn't need to be given to the company.Chen Siyu was adamant about buying some stones from Yu Zhengdu at a high price before finally letting them leave. At the door, Chen Siyu went to grab her car, so Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que stood there waiting.Only to see the little Daoist run over, huffing and puffing. He took out his phone, and stammered, \"Can I add you guys on WeChat?\"Daoist priest Mu was behind the little Daoist. He bowed at them and politely saluted. His voice was full of admiration, \"There are people outside of people, and a sky outside of a sky. These two householders, you have taught me a vivid lesson.\"Yu Zhengdu smiled, \"Priest is too humble. We only have different directions when it comes to technology. To each their own, to each their own.\"Daoist priest Mu shook his head and sighed, \"Householder Shang was right, we have truly become too set in our old ways. Daoism is like rowing a boat upriver; if you don't move forward, you will get pushed back. When we return this time, I will definitely prompt everyone in our temple to study technological concepts in the hopes of modernizing Daoism sooner. We must advance to not be left behind by the times.The little Daoist vigorously nodded his head. \"We are going to use technology to further our temple and guide the future Daoist path!\"Yu Zhengdu's expression remained the same; he even gave the two Daoist monks a thumbs up. \"Jiayou priest, I trust that Qinglian Temple will become the most advanced Daoist temple in the nation!\"Shang Que finally looked at them properly. \"The youth are worth educating.\"On the way back, Chen Siyu drove in the front, and Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que sat in the back.It was a bit late, and Yu Zhengdu was tired after such a busy day. He wanted to take a nap, but as soon as he leaned back, he saw that Shang Que had abandoned his normal elegant sitting posture and was sitting turned to the side, his back towards him. He was even slightly crouched over, and looked very suspicious.Yu Zhengdu furrowed his brows, stretching his neck to peek over Shang Que's shoulder.Only to see Shang Que hunched over, quietly opening the red envelope Father Chen had given them personally. Father Chen was generous, so the red envelope was quite thick. Yu Zhengdu estimated that there should be around 2,000 RMB in there.Shang Que weighed the bank notes, then gently started stuffing them into his pockets.Yu Zhengdu was even more confused. He asked without warning, \"What are you doing?\"Shang Que was scared by his sudden interruption. But the Ghost King was ultimately the Ghost King, so only his hand trembled a little; his expression remained unchanged. He turned around like nothing had happened and lightly coughed. \"This red envelope is personal, I don't need to give it to the company.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"Exactly.\"Thus Shang Que started stuffing the money into his pockets bravely. \"Then there's nothing wrong with me using it to buy in-game money right.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\"He couldn't help reflecting. How strict was he to Boss regularly, that the renowned Ghost King had started to secretly hide his personal spending money\u2026\u2026After Chen Siyu sent away Yu Zhengdu and them, she finally had some free time. She took out her phone, only to see that the WeChat group she had with her friends had somehow garnered over a thousand messages in one afternoon.She opened the chat to see that they were teasing Li Tiantian as usual. In the beginning, Li Tiantian had tried to defend herself, but in the end she clearly was no match for everyone, so went diving. Several people were even constantly @'ing Chen Siyu to be a witness.Chen Siyu:\u3010\u2026\u2026\u3011As soon as she appeared, the group chat that had finally managed to quiet exploded once more.Friend A:\u3010Siyu, you finally appeared!\u3011Friend B:\u3010The moment to witness the truth has arrived!\u3011Friend C:\u3010Tiantian was bluffing to us this afternoon, saying that you invited the people from the magnet-selling company to your home. We laughed so hard and almost believed her!\u3011Friend A:\u3010Isn't that right! But thankfully we remembered the things you said in the past. With no need to say anything else, we posted screenshots of what you said before. Don't worry, your woman of the times image still remains. We gotchu\u3011Chen Siyu looked at the screenshots of previous messages she had sent in the chat and suddenly felt like her face was swollen.She took a picture of the stones she had bought from Yu Zhengdu and uploaded it to the chat.Chen Siyu:\u3010\u2026\u2026Um, Tiantian wasn't bluffing. I bought a dozen magnets from that company\u3011Everyone:\u3010\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u3011Friend A:\u3010Jeez, who are you?\u3011Friend B:\u3010Did you get hacked??????\u3011Friend C:\u3010A dozen????????\u3011Li Tiantian:\u3010A dozen???????\u3011Chen Siyu:\u3010That company is truly very impressive. I think you guys should go buy some of their magnets to carry around too\u3011Everyone:\u3010\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u3011Friend A:\u3010Siyu wake up. Those are just pebbles!\u3011Friend B:\u3010I can dig up 2 kg of those rocks for you from the flower pot under my house. If you have so much money to spare, can you sponsor me?\u3011Friend C:\u3010My goodness, these days you can use pebbles to collect intelligence tax??\u3011Chen Siyu looked at the wailing in the chat and decided to tell them what happened with the haunting at her home, exactly as it happened. Of course, she left out the part about the mess with the Yaochu stockholder. After she finished, the chat was silent.Chen Siyu waited a long time and still got no response. She thought no one believed her, so spoke again.Chen Siyu:\u3010What I'm saying is the truth. Tiantian was unlucky before because she had run into a ghost too. It had nothing to do with astrology\u3011Chen Siyu wasn't stupid. After witnessing what happened in her home, she guessed that Li Tiantian's situation probably wasn't that simple either, so asked Yu Zhengdu about it. Yu Zhengdu told her the truth, so she shared this story in the group chat too.When she was finished, someone in the group finally regained their wits.Friend A:\u3010\u2026\u2026I'm not listening I'm not listening I'm not listening. There are no such things as ghosts!!!\u3011Friend B:\u3010Can you make up a more believable story. What do you mean modern evil removing technology, and handcuffs to catch ghosts??? Siyu, wake up ah\u3011Friend C:\u3010Then take out some evidence\u3011Where would Chen Siyu get evidence? Her phone couldn't take pictures of ghosts. But she did have some pictures of when Daoist priest Mu was preparing to cast his spells. She looked through her alb.u.m and picked two to randomly upload.Chen Siyu:\u3010It's up to you if you want to believe it or not\u3011Rest of the group:\u3010\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u3011In the group, Li Tiantian, who had originally been the one to believe in the luck-changing magnets the most, lost her mind first.Li Tiantian:\u3010\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Aaaaaah, why couldn't you let me happily live in my astrology fantasies!!\u3011Chen Siyu:\u3010Why are you complaining. My worldview shattered more completely, okay\u3011The next morning, as soon as Yu Zhengdu walked into the company, Kang Jin and his other coworkers sniffed and huddled around him like dogs.Kang Jin walked in a circle around Yu Zhengdu and asked, \"What is it, it smells so good!\"Yu Zhengdu shook the bag in his hand and took an item out. He smiled, \"How come all your noses are so good?\"Kang Jin's eyes lit up as soon as he took a look. \"Incense!\"Yu Zhengdu said, \"Yesterday I earned some extra money, so I've brought some afternoon tea for everyone.\"In this period of time, he had learned that ghosts mainly relied on offerings from humans for food and items they used daily, but in the mortal realm, offerings were only given during special holidays or memorials. Even though ghosts didn't need to eat three meals a day like humans, these offerings were still valuable, so after receiving them, many ghosts were unwilling to eat them all at once.After seeing Hao Wentao's tragic situation yesterday, Yu Zhengdu strongly felt that it was hard being a ghost too, so used the money from the red envelope Father Chen had given them to buy some offerings for everyone.Kang Jin started crying then and there. He grabbed Yu Zhengdu's hand and refused to let go. \"Starting from today, you're my best friend in the entire company!\"All the other ghosts b.u.t.ted him away. \"Move, he's my best friend.\"Shang Que came out of his office and furrowed his brows. \"What's everyone arguing about so early in the morning?\"As soon as Boss appeared, n.o.body dared to fool around anymore. They all threw a significant look at Yu Zhengdu, then obediently went back to their seats.Yu Zhengdu showed Shang Que the incense in his hands. \"I got some takeout for everyone.\"Shang Que stared at the items in his hands, then slowly spoke up a moment later, \"Where's mine?\"Yu Zhengdu looked surprised. \"You want it too?\"Shang Que: \"\u2026\u2026Are you saying I don't get any?\"\"You do, you do.\" Yu Zheng laughed, then pulled out an incense that was the thickness of a fist from his bag. \"Heh heh, this was the store treasure of the incense store. It can burn for three continuous days.\"Shang Que hrmph'd, then added, \"I also want braised pork.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026Why have you started ordering food?\"Shang Que gazed at him, silent.A moment later, Yu Zhengdu automatically surrendered. \"Fine fine fine, if you want braised pork, then you get braised pork.\"When Li Tiantian arrived at Luofeng's office carrying a basket of fruit, she saw Yu Zhengdu burning incense.Li Tiantian: \"\u2026\u2026\"Li Tiantian looked around warily. She wanted to smile, but couldn't, so only muttered, \"Student Yu, you guys really know how to catch ghosts\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu didn't lie to her again, nodding while vaguely explaining, \"The Underworld energy on ghosts is directly linked to one's health, so it's included in our scope of business too.\"Li Tiantian: \"\u2026\u2026Your scope of business is quite large.\"\"It's alright.\" Yu Zhengdu smiled and teased her, \"Oh yeah, the ghost who was hara.s.sing you last time is still here. Do you want to see her?\"Li Tiantian hurriedly shook her hands, \"No need no need.\" Let her live in her astrology fantasies!Li Tiantian had come this time to specially thank them. After learning the truth from Chen Siyu, she felt embarra.s.sed about having misunderstood them before. Even though she was terrified of ghosts, she still brought the fruit basket, and even gave him a red envelope.Yu Zhengdu wouldn't take it, saying it wasn't hard to deal with at all.Li Tiantian still had to go to work, so after chatting for a bit, said she needed to leave. Before she left, she added, \"Oh right, I have a few other friends who want to buy your magnets\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu: \"Ah?\"Li Tiantian: \"And, they heard that your company provides Underworld energy detection, so they want to ask you guys to do an Underworld energy check-up for them\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu: \"Huh?\"Li Tiantian asked him, \"There's no problem right?\"Yu Zhengdu: \"No problem, no problem.\"Who would've thought, the company's first products to gain profit were detectors and magnets\u2026\u2026Updating Mon/Wed this week and next week so we can get a discord channel at 20 chapters ? LOLPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayNot all of Li Tiantian's friends believed what Chen Siyu said. There were a few here and there that thought she had made up the story or had been scammed, but most of them were willing to believe that it was true. But another factor was that they were all from fairly well off families, so buying a stone really wouldn't make much of a dent.It was the Underworld energy detection technology that everyone was actually more interested in. They thought that whether or not the program was real could be seen in an instant, unlike the chance factors involved in stones changing one's luck. Thus they all hoped that if they bought the stones, they could also get a check-up along the way.After hearing their order requirements, Yu Zhengdu felt a little surprised. He never imagined that a little program he made for fun would cause people to want to pay to try it\u2026\u2026Due to this being the company's first time receiving a ma.s.s order for magnets, Yu Zhengdu counted the numbers and prepared to discuss with Boss. Except Shang Que called him into his office first.Shang Que placed his own phone in front of Yu Zhengdu. On it was his WeChat chat history with Wei Xiao.Shang Que said, \"He wants to buy rocks\u2026\u2026\"He paused for a moment then added, \"Ma.s.s order.\"Yu Zhengdu glanced at Shang Que's WeChat. Wei Xiao's nickname was: Really rich.Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\"He quickly read through their chat history and finally understood what was going on.It turned out that ever since Wei Xiao bought the stone from Luofeng, his daughter Wei Mo hadn't lost her soul again. Her health even got quite a bit better, and she became livelier.Because of Wei Mo's special condition, Wei Xiao and his wife hadn't dared to let her attend preschool before. They were both busy with work originally, and having to take care of a child on top of that had caused them a lot of stress across the years. But recently, Wei Xiao had started contacting schools for Wei Mo. This would not only allow him and his wife to relax a little, it would also allow their daughter the opportunity to lead the same kind of life as her peers.His child's situation had always been a sore point for him. Now that the sore point was relieved, he and his wife both became revitalized; this change naturally caught their friends' attentions. When they asked him, he didn't hide the truth.People at Wei Xiao's level had a social circle comprised of other rich people. What these people had in common was the fact that after they finally became successful after working hard, they also became older. As they were able to enjoy the fruits of their labor, they became more worried about their health and life too, more than the average person. Many naturally started turning to superst.i.tions. Because they had an abundance of money, they were also more willing to invest in these matters than the average person.Because Wei Xiao often had to personally care for his daughter, Wei Mo's situation was quite well known in his social circle. This, in addition to Wei Xiao being a rather honest person, caused people to generally believe what he said. Either way, they wouldn't lose much, so quite a few people asked Wei Xiao to help them order stones. Some who were especially careless with their wealth asked for over ten at once.In the WeChat conversation, Wei Xiao's att.i.tude was extremely sincere.Yu Zhengdu momentarily paused, then slowly told Shang Que, \"I just received a purchase order too\u2026\u2026\"He explained the situation with Li Tiantian's friends, then the both of them simultaneously became silent.Shang Que propped his chin up, a confused expression on his face. \"Why are humans so scared of dying? Dying isn't scary at all\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026That's what you ghosts think!\"Shang Que remained unbothered; he had just said that casually. At the moment, the most important thing was how to deal with the ma.s.s order.In the past, they had only used selling stones as an excuse. In actuality, they worked in capturing ghosts and removing evil. This was their first time receiving an official order for buying stones, and the quant.i.ty was quite large. Beyond that, the customers were all of somewhat important backgrounds. Yu Zhengdu thought for a moment, then decided that they couldn't keep selling stones using the same method as in the past.He spent a fair amount of time explaining to Shang Que the importance of establis.h.i.+ng a brand awareness. The most important thing was, the Life and Death Accounts system that he was developing now could not be used to make profit, but would still need an untold amount of maintenance and upgrading later on. Basically, it was the equivalent of a black hole. The company needed the ability to make long-term profits to ensure that the system could continue running forever.And constant profits required an endless flow of customers. Creating a product brand was an essential part of the process.Shang Que had previously only been too lazy to work with others, and he also thought there was no need. But he understood the concept as soon as he heard it, so immediately said, \"I can give them rocks that can provide disaster relief and remove evil.\"Yu Zhengdu nodded. \"Not only that, but the stones need to look good, and all the same. This way, as soon as people see them, they'll know our company made them.\"The two brainstormed together and very quickly came up with a plan of action\u2026\u2026 Since they were seriously selling luck-changing stones, they might as well do it more professionally.Shang Que gave this task to Lu Lingxi and told her to buy a batch of jade rocks from Ledu City.Ledu and Fu City were neighbors. There was a Desperate Mountain on the border between the two. The mountain produced a type of jade that was ugly and full of impurities as well as black rock bits. They couldn't be sold in the fine jades market, so were used by local craftsmen to create some souvenirs. If you visited Desperate Mountain for vacation, you could buy two of these jade bracelets for 10 RMB; they were very cheap.But what they wanted to buy wasn't the raw jade. After ordering the jade, Shang Que gave Lu Lingxi a paper with a strange charm drawn onto it, and told her to hire some local craftsmen at Desperate Mountain to engrave this charm onto the jade rocks.Yu Zhengdu stared at the charm for a while but still couldn't understand what it was, so asked Shang Que. He then learned that this charm came from the same source as the Daoist \"Fengdu Ghost Summoning Magical Seal\".The magical seals cultivators used were for borrowing power. The immense power generated was actually because they borrowed the power of the heavenly G.o.ds. Thus, when the heavens and earth fell apart and all the G.o.ds were destroyed, the power that could be borrowed by magical seals could only come from the remnants of energy remaining between the earth and sky. The effects were obviously not as good as before; the magical seals used by Daoists suffered in the same way.In regards to Shang Que's seal, saying it came from the same source as the \"Fengdu Ghost Summoning Magical Seal\" was being polite. To be more accurate, the \"Fengdu Ghost Summoning Magical Seal\"was adapted from his seal. It borrowed the collective power of the Luofeng ghosts and could remove evil spirits and demons.Yu Zhengdu thought about it before realizing, Shang Que's t.i.tle of \"Ghost King\" had a prefix\u2014\u2014Luofeng Mountain.\"A thousand years ago, many Daoists in the mortal realm borrowed the power of Luofeng Mountain. Thus, my magical seal became known to the world,\" Shang Que said. \"But as time pa.s.sed, the mortal realm slowly started engraving my seal wrong. That's how it eventually evolved to become the Fengdu Ghost Summoning Magical Seal.\"Yu Zhengdu had an epiphany. \"Then that means yours is the mother copy!\"Shang Que: \"\u2026\u2026\" Even though the meaning is right, why does it sound so strange when he says it like that.Shang Que very smartly decided not to argue with Yu Zhengdu over the adjective he used, and instead put up a sincere front. He crossed his arms in front of his chest and said, \"Since they are spending a lot of money buying jade, I can lend them some of Luofeng Mountain's collective ghost power for protection.\"Yu Zhengdu summarized, \"Isn't that the same as accepting a protection fee!\" The so-called doing work for money, borrowing ghosts to hit other ghosts.Shang Que hrmph'd. \"We do it legally.\"Yu Zhengdu ignored Shang Que and turned to examine the magical seal instead.Shang Que's magical seal was definitely the mother copy; it seemed to be completely written in an ancient language that Yu Zhengdu couldn't read, and there were also some symbols with unclear meanings. Yu Zhengdu inspected it for a long time but still didn't understand anything.When it was almost the end of the work day, Shang Que walked out of his office, only to see that Yu Zhengdu was still examining the magical seal. He asked, \"Are you very interested in this?\"\"Of course,\" Yu Zhengdu nodded sagely. \"Didn't you say this seal could borrow the power of ghosts? I run into ghosts all the time now, so it's crucial I learn some skills to protect myself. If I can memorize this magical seal, maybe it'll be of use during a decisive moment.\"Shang Que snorted. \"You aren't planning on drawing it when you run into a situation, right?\"Yu Zhengdu looked up at him. \"What? That's not okay?\"Shang Que shook his head. \"You don't use magical seals like that.\"Yu Zhengdu immediately wilted. \"You could've told me earlier. What a waste of half my day.\"Shang Que looked at him, quite exasperated. \"If you're scared, I can teach you a heart seal.\"Yu Zhengdu didn't understand half of what he said. \"What's a heart seal?\"\"The Daoists of the mortal realm believe in learning with the heart. All magical equipment in the world must be controlled by the magic in the heart. After I teach you the heart seal, all you need to do is read it to yourself, and you'll be able to borrow the power of ghosts to protect yourself,\" Shang Que briefly explained to him before continuing, \"But you must use your heart to activate the heart seal. So even if I teach it to you, if your ability to understand is poor, you still won't be able to use it.\"Yu Zhengdu clapped. \"That doesn't matter, just teach me first. It's a win-win situation for me either way.\"Shang Que: \"\u2026\u2026\"The heart seal Shang Que spoke of actually involved borrowing his own power to Yu Zhengdu. Aside from this, he also taught Yu Zhengdu an incantation, and told him to memorize and understand it.The incantation was long and a mouthful. Worse yet, it wasn't easy to understand at all. Yu Zhengdu complained while he looked at it, \"I should never have been greedy about getting the 5 insurances and housing fund. I've ended up having to work on program development, learn how to catch ghosts, and now I have to memorize an incantation. If this continues on, I'll be on my way to immortal cultivation\u2026\u2026\"Shang Que directly ignored his complaints and patted his shoulder. \"The heart seal is the most difficult magical seal to use. In the past, many Daoists used their whole lives to try and still couldn't understand the secret behind the heart seal. Take it slow, if you really run into a ghost, it'll probably be faster to just call me.\"Yu Zhengdu placed a hand over his fist in a salute and said, \"Thank you so much.\"Yu Zhengdu wrote the incantation down in the Notes app of his phone. He kept memorizing it on his walk back to school, strongly feeling that work was difficult.There was still a bit of time before graduation, so the majority of students still lived in the school dorms. Yu Zhengdu had just turned into the dorm aisle when he heard loud laughter coming out of his dormroom. Someone yelled, \"Hurry hurry hurry, it's my turn.\"Yu Zhengdu felt hesitant. He walked into his room, only to see that it was filled with his male cla.s.smates. Everyone was in a circle, a bed desk on the empty ground in the middle. There was a piece of paper on the desk, and his roommate Zhu Yan, along with two other male students from another room, were all holding onto the same pen, hands on top of each other.Yu Zhengdu furrowed his brows and grabbed a male cla.s.smate next to him to ask, \"What's going on?\"The student said, \"We're playing Pen Spirit. f.u.c.k, their acting skills have gotten so much better. They just finished answering a bunch of questions.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\"Male students with nothing to do prior to graduation can really come up with anything when they're bored.Yu Zhengdu was tired after working the whole day, so wasn't in the mood to play around with everyone else. He pushed his way through the crowd to his own bed, saying, \"Excuse me, excuse me.\"To the side, Zhu Yan discovered that he was back, so lifted his head to shout, \"Zhengdu, you're back just in time. We're playing Pen Spirit, come join us.\"The other spoke too, \"Yeah, we successfully invited a pen spirit so if you want to ask any questions, now's your chance.\"\"Okay.\" Yu Zhengdu popped his head out from above his bed, looking down at everyone. He smiled, \"Then I'll ask, is this pen spirit a boy or a girl?\"Everyone started laughing after hearing this. Someone else said, \"That's a good question!\"Another person added, \"If you ask that won't the pen spirit get angry!\"Zhu Yan puffed out his chest. \"Don't worry, let us bravely ask.\"Yu Zhengdu: = = There was no doubt about it, these were his stupid cla.s.smates.He tucked his head back onto his bed and took out his phone, only to see Shang Que had sent him two more lines of the incantation, saying: I forgot two lines from the incantation I gave you today.Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\"He read it over, then read the part he already memorized with the two new lines together silently to himself. But as soon as he finished reading, a gust of cold wind suddenly blew into the room. The students squeezed together all trembled, then said, \"f.u.c.k, where's that wind coming from!\"Zhu Yan looked in the direction of the balcony door. \"Probably from the corridors. Can someone go close the back door, I'm freezing to death.\"But Yu Zhengdu thought something was wrong. He very keenly discovered that after the gust of cold wind, the temperature in the room had also dropped. He felt suspicious, so stuck his head out again to look.This look scared him half to death. He saw that an extra person was standing on Zhu Yan's side, starting from an unknown time.It was a slightly chubby boy. He was dressed a bit sloppily, with flip-flops on his feet. He s.h.i.+fted his gaze down to ask lowly, \"Who? Who called me over?\"He looked around, but saw that no one had noticed him. He thus slowly scanned his surroundings, until his sight landed on the pen on the table. He laughed darkly, \"Oh, have you called me to be the pen spirit?\"\"Then let me guide you down a clear path.\" As he spoke, he sat next to Zhu Yan and stuck his hand out too, holding onto the pen in Zhu Yan's hand.At this time, Zhu Yan very bravely repeated Yu Zhengdu's question. \"Pen spirit pen spirit, are you a boy or girl?\"The cla.s.smates to the side started making a commotion. \"A girl! Definitely a girl!\"Simultaneously, the pen started slowly moving again. But unlike the past few times, it took a lot of effort for Zhu Yan to hold it. He glared at the other two students in dissatisfaction: Listen to me!Coincidentally, the other two students were looking at him too. Their gazes read the same: It's your turn to listen to me!It was unclear who the pen was listening to, but it ultimately crookedly wrote out: Boy.The cla.s.smates: \"Yu\u2014\u2014\"Zhu Yan was extremely disappointed. He smacked his lips. \"I wanted to invite a female pen spirit.\"The other two also complained, \"Yeah, invite a girl ah. Why did you write boy\u2026\u2026\"Zhu Yan suddenly thought something was a bit off. But at this time, another person popped up and yelled at them. \"It's my turn. Hurry and help me ask, when will I get a girlfriend?\"Everyone else laughed upon hearing this. Someone asked, \"Can you ask something a little more meaningful?\"That cla.s.smate was unimpressed. \"How is this not meaningful? This is the most important meaning to my life!\"Zhu Yan was just about to tell them to stop for the day, only to hear his accomplices say, \"Fine fine fine. Tonight everyone gets a turn, ask anything you want\u2026\u2026\"Before he finished talking, the pen in their hands slowly started moving. Zhu Yan's heart trembled. He glared at the other two, trying to convey his words through his gaze, but saw that those two were also peering over at him. The look in their eyes was the same: You've broken the rules!But the pen not only didn't stop, but wobbled and wrote a few large characters as everyone watched. They looked: Single dog.Thus everybody broke out into laughter. The cla.s.smate who asked the question immediately became red. He pointed and them, agitated. \"You must be faking it! You didn't successfully invite the pen spirit at all!\"The person next to him nudged him. \"That's not what you said earlier.\"Yu Zhengdu witnessed the whole scene. The fat ghost had on an expression of satisfaction and was making faces at the student. \"I don't even have a girlfriend, so you can't have one either.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu calmly withdrew his head back onto the bed, and messaged his boss:\u3010Boss, are you there? Help me remove a ghost.\u3011Shang Que's response was quick.My broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010\u2026\u2026You ran into a ghost again?\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010It's all your incantation's fault. I read it and a ghost appeared\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010There's something wrong with your heart seal!\u3011This time Shang Que was quiet for a while. About three minutes later, he finally replied, somewhat speechless:\u3010Those Daoists spend their lifetime learning and can only borrow the power of ghosts\u3011\u3010How did you directly borrow a ghost?\u3011Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If you want him to do something, order him to do it.\u3011Yu Zhengdu paused, and then became invigorated:\u3010There's such a good thing?!\u3011He didn't know how Shang Que felt. A response came a while later:\u3010You summoned him with my magical seal\u2026\u2026\u3011He didn't know if he was getting the wrong impression, but Yu Zhengdu thought he could read a bit of indignance from those ellipsis\u2026\u2026At this time, Zhu Yan was kind of starting to panic. He said, \"Today's divination ends here. Let's send the pen spirit away.\"The other students still weren't completely satisfied, but Zhu Yan didn't want to keep fooling around. He pretended he knew what he was doing and stated, \"Pen spirit pen spirit, we're done asking questions. Can you please leave.\"After he finished reading, the three holding the pen simultaneously started to move the pen away from the paper\u2026\u2026but found they couldn't.Not only this, but the pen started slowly writing again: I just got here, I'm not leaving.Zhu Yan's face immediately paled. He said, \"Hey, stop it you two. Hurry and send the pen spirit away.\"The other two had just now realized that something was wrong. The color of their faces were just as pale as his. They furiously shook their heads, \"It's not me.\"The pen started moving again. This time, it wrote: It's me.Zhu Yan swallowed. He forced his voice not to shake. \"You guys, stop fooling around.\"The other two also looked like they were about to cry. \"It's really, really not me.\"The pen wrote: I'm not fooling around.The students watching now felt scared too. \"Hey, stop acting you guys.\"\"Enough's enough. Stop trying to freak us out.\"Zhu Yan was close to crying. \"I'm not scaring anyone, it's those two. I'm not joking, let go you guys!\"As soon as he finished speaking, not only could they still not let go of the pen, but it started slowly moving again\u2026\u2026Zhu Yan and the other two immediately widened their eyes. They looked at each other, and this time, very clearly saw the absolute horror in the others' eyes.Zhu Yan couldn't help trembling. \"Did the pen, pen spirit really co-come\u2026\u2026\"A sudden chilly sensation arose in everyone's hearts.\"It came my a.s.s, you guys have a cramp, right.\" Yu Zhengdu's voice suddenly b.u.t.ted in. At the same time, he pressed his hand onto the other three's hands.Zhu Yan realized just then that Yu Zhengdu had at some time gotten off his bed and squeezed his way beside them.\"It'll be fine if you ma.s.sage it a little.\" Yu Zhengdu used the hand on top of theirs to squeeze their hands. He simultaneously read the incantation to himself to strengthen the heart seal.Zhu Yan wasn't in the mood to joke around with him. He practically wailed, \"That's not it. We don't have cramps, I think it's really the pen spirit\u2026\u2026\"Before he finished speaking, his expression suddenly changed. \"\u2026\u2026Yi?\"In that moment, Yu Zhengdu also let go of their hands. \"How about it, is your cramp better now?\"Zhu Yan and the two others thus easily relaxed their hands that were holding the pen. The looks on their faces were: ???????Zhu Yan still couldn't believe it. He shook his hand, saying in shock, \"Holy s.h.i.+t, really? It really was cramped?\"A cla.s.smate next to him was speechless and couldn't help hitting him on the head. \"You guys are really too much. You scared me to death.\"A different student was scornful. \"Come off it, they were definitely faking it!\"Yu Zhengdu shook his head, speaking sagely, \"Never overdo something.\"Zhu Yan still felt some lingering fear, and hurriedly added, \"Don't say anything about overdoing it, I'm never playing this again.\"Those heartless male cla.s.smates could never learn a lesson. Only moments later, they started messing around again, saying they wanted to play Werewolf Kill instead. Yu Zhengdu was speechless for a second before squeezing his way out of the dormroom.He focused his energy on guiding the ghost out of the room and found a corner n.o.body was paying attention to before relaxing. His expression was fatigued. \"Ah, I'm so tired.\"Even though the heart seal was easy to use, only having to silently read the incantation, it actually required a huge amount of mental energy.The fatty was forced out. As soon as he regained his freedom, his expression immediately became savage. \"So you're the one who called me out?\"\"That's right!\" Yu Zhengdu stood up a bit straighter. Even though Shang Que said that the ghosts he summoned needed to listen to him, he was still ultimately a novice and felt fear about being alone and face to face with a ghost.As expected, the fatty wasn't an obedient ghost. His entire body was pale, almost green, and he had long bangs that covered one eye, making him appear all the more ghastly. Upon hearing Yu Zhengdu's words, he laughed strangely. \"Oh, why did you call me out?\"Yu Zhengdu: \"Nothing much. I just wanted to practice.\"He paused for a moment, then asked, \"You have to obey my commands, right?\"\"Said who?\" Fatty rolled his eyes. \"If you want me to listen, you have to have the skill to make me.\"His facial features slowly scrunched together on his slightly chubby face. \"There's not a hint of any Daoist ability on you. Did you just use a random ghost summoning spell that you came across? Didn't anyone tell you that to summon a ghost you also need to know how to control a ghost?\"Yu Zhengdu said \"f.u.c.k\" in his heart: Truly, no one did!Fatty saw that he was quiet, and thought that this was confirmation for his theory. The smile on his face became even more terrifying.\"Do you know what the price of summoning a ghost without knowing how to control it is?\"\"No.\" Yu Zhengdu went with the flow and asked, \"What's the price?\"Fatty didn't imagine that he would turn around and ask him, so hesitated for a moment. Then purposefully acted severe. \"Something very serious.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\" This ghost seems quite new to the job.The fatty saw that he had stopped speaking, so thought that he was scared. He immediately smiled, pleased. \"But, as long as you listen to my orders, I can consider letting you off.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"For example?\"Fatty seemed to have a list of things prepared from a while back, so as soon as Yu Zhengdu asked, he started counting on his fingers the things he wanted. \"Prepare a few of the most recent games and the newest j.a.panese AV model photobooks as offerings for me. Aside from this, you also need to vote for the idols I support; I'm going to supervise the number of votes you cast everyday\u2026\u2026\"As he spoke, Yu Zhengdu swiftly messaged his boss.Yu Zhengdu:\u3010You lied to me! The ghost isn't listening to me, instead it's making me listen to it!\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010What use do I have for this ghost!\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010There's something wrong with your heart seal, something really wrong!\u3011My broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010\u2026\u2026\u3011Shang Que maintained his use of ellipsis for a long time. Yu Zhengdu didn't know what he was indecisive about.The fatty in front of him had already finished listing his requirements. He squinted his eyes at Yu Zhengdu, tone threatening, \"Did you take note of that all?\"Yu Zhengdu took a step back, then calmly said, \"My boss wants to talk to you.\"Fatty was bewildered. \"Your boss?\"At the same time, Yu Zhengdu resolutely pressed at WeChat's video call function. Shang Que gave him enough face by picking up immediately. \"What?\"Yu Zhengdu shoved the phone screen at the fatty. \"Boss, you need to control these ghosts!\"Shang Que: \"\u2026\u2026\"Fatty looked at the handsome man in the video. The question mark above his head grew bigger. \"Who are you?\"Shang Que's face was expressionless through the screen. His voice was light too, but seemed to carry a weight that made one want to tremble. Fatty's heart suddenly quivered.He said, \"I'm the CEO of Luofeng Management.\"Fatty's eyes suddenly widened. The disbelief in his voice was obvious. \"Boss Sh-Shang?\"He thought it was impossible, but the pressure that seemed to come from everywhere indicated the other's extraordinary ident.i.ty. This was the aura only a Ghost King could have.At this time, the phone in his pocket vibrated.Fatty trembled as he took out his phone and looked.\u3010Sun Guofeng, our company has received a citizen's report detailing your refusal to comply with the laws governing serving ghosts, purposeful causing of trouble, and intimidating our company's employees. Please immediately stop your wrongdoings and follow the rules of being a ghost, or we will promptly send out an employee to arrest you for further punishment. -Luofeng Life Management Consulting Co. Ltd.\u3011Sun Guofeng: ????????The terror in his eyes turned into confusion. \"Who reported me? When did I intimidate an employee of Luofeng?\"Yu Zhengdu lifted his chin and puffed out his chest, \"Me, I reported you!\"In the phone screen, Shang Que expressionlessly stated, \"He's our company's employee.\"Sun Guofeng immediately burst out, \"H-h-he, he's a living person though!\"Yu Zhengdu: \"I was so outstanding that they specially hired me!\"Shang Que: \"Do you know what the consequences of intimidating our company's employees are?\"Sun Guofeng's entire ghostly being melted onto the floor. He held his head and pleaded, \"I was wrong, don't arrest me\u2014\u2014\"His voice was full of regret. \"It's just that I finally got summoned for once and couldn't help wanting to scare some people. Actually I'm not very brave at all, I wouldn't ever dare to harm anyone\u2014\u2014\"Yu Zhengdu looked at him speechlessly. \"Then do you still want the games?\"\"No.\" Sun Guofeng shook his head vigorously. \"I don't want the photobooks anymore either, or the voting. I don't want anything.\"Sun Guofeng pleaded with teary eyes, \"Please don't report me!\"Yu Zhengdu placed his hands on his hips. \"That depends on how you act.\"Sun Guofeng suddenly rushed over and held onto his thigh. \"From now on I'm your serving ghost. However you want me to act, I'll act that way. I'll listen to everything you say!\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026Okay.\"He worked hard to try and pull his leg out from the other's grasp first.Yu Zhengdu had nothing he needed to be done, so simply warned Sun Guofeng and told him not to scare people anymore, then finally let him go.After watching Sun Guofeng disappear, Yu Zhengdu finally stretched his back. He shook his head and sighed, \"Boss is really too unreliable!\"Boss's voice came out of the phone. \"Is that so?\"Yu Zhengdu raised his phone to look, only to see Boss was staring at him through the phone screen. His dark, black eyes were very clearly unhappy.Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026How come you still haven't hung up?\"Shang Que calmly stared at him, silent.Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\" This again, it's time to decipher Boss's gaze again.Why didn't Boss understand, their teamwork really wasn't that good yet\u2026\u2026Even though this was the case, Yu Zhengdu could still tell that he wasn't happy. At a time like this, if he straight out said he couldn't understand what Boss was trying to express, he would probably have to become a chicken in the next life.Yu Zhengdu didn't dare to say anything directly, so could only act like nothing had happened and stared back at Boss. The two of them gazed at each other silently through the phone screen.After another short while, Shang Que finally gave up and furrowed his brows. He was very displeased. \"Why haven't you apologized yet?\"Yu Zhengdu: \"Ah?\"Shang Que's voice was full of accusation. \"I didn't hang up because I was watching the ghost to make sure he wouldn't bully you. But you said I'm unreliable!\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\"After hearing this, it seemed he was reliable, but it just felt weird.Yu Zhengdu scratched his head. \"Sorry, don't be angry ah\u2026\u2026\"Shang Que hrmph'd reluctantly.Coincidentally, a cla.s.smate was pa.s.sing by and heard this last sentence. He immediately teased, \"Yo, Zhengdu, kneeling on the keyboard to your girlfriend?\"\"Where would a single dog get a girlfriend from.\" Yu Zhengdu turned around to answer, \"I'm video chatting with my boss.\"That student's expression immediately became complex. His mouth twitched. \"Your relations.h.i.+p with your boss is really so good, video chatting him in the middle of the night to apologize\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\"In the screen, Shang Que asked, \"What's kneeling on the keyboard?\"The business of selling jade continued smoothly, and the company's finances became less tight. Thus, when Boss occasionally spent some money on his games, everyone decided to turn a blind eye.Yu Zhengdu split his time between continuing the development of the Life and Death Accounts and perfecting the programming for the \"Underworld Energy Detector\". After testing it out a few times on Li Tiantian's friends, the final results were quite satisfactory.After confirming the reliability and accuracy of the program, Yu Zhengdu discussed with Shang Que about selling the luck-changing jade with the Underworld energy detection service as a combo deal. The selling point was using each person's Underworld energy levels to specifically pair them with the most appropriate jade product.The first customers were, of course, the friends Wei Xiao had recommended over.But the promotion for this product didn't go that smoothly. This was mainly because the Underworld energy detection program sounded very much like a scam, so though Wei Xiao's friends were rich, they didn't want to be scammed. Thus, they didn't display much interest. In the end, it was only Wei Xiao and two others who really had nothing else to do who went and tried it out.Yu Zhengdu had no expectations for this product, as the money they had made from selling jade was already enough to pay his salary through the end of his contract. As for whether or not it would profit in the future, that didn't have much to do with him either. So, after finis.h.i.+ng up with the program, he turned his attention back to the Life and Death Accounts and no longer paid any mind to it.A few days later, Yu Zhengdu felt that the atmosphere in the company was strangely more relaxed. His coworkers seemed to spend their days very happy.When Kang Jin pa.s.sed by him, humming, he finally couldn't help himself and asked, \"How come you guys have been so happy these past few days?\"\"Because it's almost vacation time.\" Kang Jin straightened his wig, a smile tugging at the corners of his lips, \"Qingming Festival is coming up, so we have a 3 day mini vacation to go home. There, we'll also get some offerings from our families.\"His entire ghostly being seemed especially pleased, \"Maybe my family will burn me some new clothes!\"Yu Zhengdu was struck by sudden realization. Even though he also got a break during Qingming, this holiday meant something different to ghosts.To those in the Underworld, the Qingming Festival was the equivalent of the mortal realm's Mid-Autumn Festival. It was a day for ghosts who hadn't reincarnated yet to reunite with their relatives that were still living.Yu Zhengdu nodded, then paused. He asked again, \"What about Boss? What does Boss do during Qingming Festival?\"Kang Jin froze and thought about it. He shook his head, \"I don't know. We've never spent Qingming with Boss before.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"Is Boss like you guys? Does he have someone to bring him offerings?\"Kang Jin was bewildered, \"Probably not; Boss doesn't have any family. I heard thousands of years ago people did bring him offerings, but who would pay respects to the Ghost King these days?\"Yu Zhengdu oh'd. He waited for Kang Jin to leave before scratching his head and picking his laptop up to knock on the door of Shang Que's office.Shang Que was, as expected, racing through his virtual game world again. But as soon as he saw Yu Zhengdu walk in, he immediately exited the game and pretended nothing had happened. With a blank expression on his face, he asked, \"Do you need something?\"Yu Zhengdu put down his computer. \"Just reporting the progress on the Life and Death Accounts.\"Yu Zhengdu's reports were typically short and to the point. He quickly finished explaining what was going on in his work, then switched topics. He casually inquired, \"Oh right, Boss, do you have anything planned during the Qingming mini vacation?\"Shang Que probably didn't expect him to ask about this, so paused for a moment before responding, \"Sleeping\u2026\u2026\"He furrowed his brows. \"Why do you ask?\"\"Nothing.\" Yu Zhengdu briefly hesitated, then tested the water, \"I need to go home during Qingming to sweep the tombs\u2026\u2026\"Shang Que hrmph'd. \"I know, just go. It's not like I won't give you those vacation days.\"Yu Zhengdu slowly spat out, \"\u2026\u2026I wanted to say, the mountain where we sweep the tombs in my hometown is pretty famous. Do you want to go hiking with me?\"Shang Que became noticeably shocked. He lifted his head to look over, his expression complicated. He seemed to be struggling over something.Yu Zhengdu thought this meant he was unwilling, so realized he might be minding too much business that wasn't his own. He was just about to say that it was fine to say no, when he heard Shang Que lightly cough and ask, \"If I go to your home, how are you going to introduce me to your parents?\"Yu Zhengdu: \"Ah?\"Shang Que propped his chin up and asked quite seriously, \"I don't think anyone in the mortal realm brings their boss home with them for Qingming, right?\"Yu Zhengdu lightly laughed, \"No no no, a lot of people in the mortal realm want to invite their bosses over for Qingming.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayYu Zhengdu's hometown was Jintan Village, located in the neighboring province's Shu City. Jintan Village was in the suburbs of Shu City, so was relatively closed off geographically. There were no important local businesses, so many people chose to make their living elsewhere. Because they were good at business, quite a few became rich and turned around to help their fellow villagers. Thus, even though Jintan Village's local economy was average, the families that lived there were comparatively well off.Yu Zhengdu was the only child in his family. His grandparents had pa.s.sed away when he was young, so after he went to Fu City for school, only his parents lived at home. Their lifestyle was a little solitary, so when he told them over the phone that he was bringing a coworker home for Qingming, they thought it was a bit strange, but were still quite welcoming.\"Dad, Mom, I'm back,\" Yu Zhengdu called out from beyond the security door.\"You're back la, the news said there was traffic today. Is it true?\" Mother Yu wore an ap.r.o.n and wiped her hands as she unlocked the door. As soon as the door was opened, her eyes lit up and her voice raised two octaves, \"This must be your coworker?\"\"Yes.\" Yu Zhengdu introduced them to each other, \"This is my mom, this is Shang Que.\"\"Aiya, Xiao Shang is too handsome. He's even better looking than celebrities.\" Mother Yu's eyes were curved into crescents as she smiled. She spoke as she moved out of the way to let them in, \"Hurry, come inside and sit.\"Shang Que seemed a little awkward. He stayed slightly behind Yu Zhengdu and nodded expressionlessly, \"h.e.l.lo.\"His response couldn't be considered very polite, but his good looks blinded Mother Yu's reasoning, so she didn't see any issues with it. She even smiled and brought out a platter of fruit for them.\"Where's Dad?\" Yu Zhengdu asked.\"He went to the clan gathering. Apparently Yu Manchuan had some proposal or something.\" Mother Yu looked at Shang Que as she spoke. \"I'm cooking right now, so you guys watch some TV first. We'll be able to eat soon.\"\"Un.\" Shang Que's body was a bit stiff. He seemed to hesitate for a moment, before pulling out a bag and handing it over. \"This is for you guys.\"\"Ey, just coming is enough, no need to be so polite.\" Mother Yu suddenly started smiling even more and reached out to grab the item.Next to him, Yu Zhengdu froze. He looked at Boss in surprise, \"You brought a gift?\"Shang Que's expression was a bit unnatural as he asked in confusion, \"Don't you mortals normally bring a gift when it's your first time at someone else's residence?\"That's true, but you're a ghost ah. And a poor ghost with an att.i.tude at that\u2026\u2026Yu Zhengdu secretly roasted him in his head, but quickly realized something. He quietly questioned in shock, \"This isn't your first time as a guest at someone else's home right?\"Shang Que sat up straight and remained unmoving, only glancing at him from the corner of his eye. \"\u2026\u2026In the Underworld it isn't in fas.h.i.+on to go to other people's homes. And most ghosts can't afford to invite me.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026You're right.\"Mother Yu took out the item from the bag, only to discover that it was a set of four little black bowls around the size of an infant's fist. Their forms were simple and unsophisticated, and the glazed surfaces were covered with thin designs. They appeared to be have been purposefully made to look antique, as the little bowls all appeared somewhat old.Yu Zhengdu's family was your cla.s.sic average family. None of them had any sophisticated hobbies, so knew nothing about ceramics. Mother Yu looked at the four little bowls left and right, then stated very enthusiastically, \"These bowls look very useful. How about we use them for lunch?\"Though Yu Zhengdu thought there was nothing special about those bowls, he gave his Boss a lot of face and immediately responded, \"Okay, sounds good. And there's four bowls for four people, simply perfect.\"The corner of Shang Que's mouth slightly twitched. He tried to hold himself back, but couldn't, so slowly opened his mouth. \"Those are tea cups.\"Mother Yu: \"\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\"The scene suddenly became very awkward, but Yu Zhengdu very quickly picked up the tea cups and gave him a thumbs up without even blus.h.i.+ng. \"You can tell with just one look that they're good tea cups. I'll go wash them first and then bring them out for some tea.\"Mother Yu calmly stood up straight. \"Let me get you guys some tea leaves.\"Shang Que's mouth twitched once more, but he ultimately didn't speak again.Yu Zhengdu finished was.h.i.+ng the tea cups rapidly, and made a cup of tea for both himself and Shang Que, pretending nothing had happened. Mother Yu continued preparing lunch in the kitchen.Yu Zhengdu saw that his mom wasn't around, so leaned over to ask his boss, \"I didn't see you carrying anything on the way over. Where did you pull the tea set out from?\"Shang Que glanced at him. \"Have you ever heard of the qiankun in the sleeve?\"The qiankun in the sleeve was an interesting spell that allowed one's sleeve to hold an infinite amount of items. Though Yu Zhengdu didn't know much about spells, he had watched Journey to the West before. Upon hearing this, his eyes lit up and he reached his hands over excitedly to touch Shang Que's sleeve. \"I know that spell, it's the one where you can put a bunch of stuff in your sleeve right. That's amazing, let me take a look.\"Shang Que was dressed casually; on top, he wore a thin cardigan sweater over a collared s.h.i.+rt. The sleeve of the cardigan was tight and really didn't seem like the legendary large sleeve that could contain a qiankun.Yu Zhengdu finally tugged open the sleeve of his cardigan a little bit and peeked in, only to say in confusion, \"I don't see anything\u2026\u2026\"Shang Que reached a hand out to push his head away. His expression was speechless. \"That's only the name of the spell. You don't necessarily have to use a sleeve\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu was. .h.i.t with this realization. He asked curiously, \"Then where is yours?\"Shang Que was about to speak when the sound of angry complaining drifted in through the door. \"Yu Manjiang is really too much. He even convinced the clansmen to get rid of the public ancestral temple\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu lifted his head and called out, \"Dad.\"Father Yu noticed just then that his son was home, so stopped speaking. He switched to a cheery expression and walked over. \"When did you get home?\"Then his eyes lit up. He looked at Shang Que and sighed, \"This must be your coworker? What a striking young man!\"Shang Que's back was still straight; he nodded at Father Yu. A moment later, he slowly added a slightly unnatural smile. \"h.e.l.lo.\"After they greeted each other, Yu Zhengdu inquired, \"What happened with Yu Manjiang?\"Father Yu sat down across from them and sighed. He said, \"Today the clansmen gathered the representatives from each family to go to a meeting. They said Yu Manjiang received an order in his dreams from the Three G.o.ds to enlarge the Three G.o.ds Temple. The villagers want to remove the public ancestral temple and use that s.p.a.ce to build the main hall of the Three G.o.ds Temple.\"Yu Zhengdu was dazed. \"How can that be? How can you just demolish the public ancestral temple so easily?\"Jintan Village was located in a closed-off area, and was small, so many traditions were still held to the standards of the past. For example, during the paying of respects for large holidays, everyone still went to the same public ancestral temple if they shared the same surname.The Three G.o.ds Temple that Father Yu spoke of was a small temple located on the side of the Yu Clan's public ancestral temple. It wors.h.i.+pped the ancestors of the Yu Clan; this practice originated during the Ming Dynasty. According to legend, three brothers of the Yu Clan were rich as could be, but also generous with their wealth. They helped the village by doing many good deeds. In their later years, there was a natural disaster and famine struck. The three brothers of the Yu Clan donated all their riches to help provide disaster relief, and thus saved a lot of people. Because of their kindness, hundreds of years later, local villagers erected a temple and carved statues for them. Even to this day, they still had an abundance of wors.h.i.+ppers.Which was to say, the Three G.o.ds weren't G.o.ds in the traditional sense. Instead, they were the guardian G.o.ds of the Yu Clan. The Three G.o.ds didn't fail the Yu Clan's faith in them, though. Throughout the years, miracles often occurred as they protected their village. Thus, they held great authority in the Yu Clan.But even though they were local G.o.ds believed in by the local people, that wasn't reason enough to demolish the public ancestral temple and enlarge their temple.Speaking of this, Father Yu looked like his liver hurt. He slapped his thigh and said angrily, \"The other village representatives and I said that too, but Yu Manjiang said the Three G.o.ds appeared to him in a dream. He even asked the tongji to fuluan. The result of the fuluan was that they truly did want to demolish the public ancestral temple. How are we supposed to respond to that!\"Upon hearing this, Yu Zhengdu understood. A troubled expression appeared on his face. \"If the tongji actually made that command, then it's likely that no matter what you say, it'll be of no use.\"The tongji they spoke of was the spirit medium of the Three G.o.ds Temple. He could use fuluan (a type of divination used by the common people, also called fuji) and invite the Three G.o.ds to possess him so he could consequently relay the Three G.o.ds' directions. Because of this, he held a bit of authority locally.If it was an order issued by the tongji during fuluan, then as a village protected by the Three G.o.ds, it was quite difficult to reject this demand.Father Yu said, \"This isn't a small issue. Even if it's a command made during fuluan, the clansmen still won't nod their heads so easily. They argued for a whole morning before deciding to each take a step back. Yu Manjiang's idea was to have the tongji summon the Three G.o.ds again tomorrow, and if the result is still the same, then n.o.body will say anything more. The clansmen are currently preparing to invite a religious master from a big temple to communicate with the Three G.o.ds to try and see if there's any room for maneuver left.\"Yu Zhengdu nodded and poured him a cup of tea. \"Then forget your anger for now. Think about it when that time comes.\"\"That's the only way.\" Father Yu sighed and took the tea cup from him. He took a sip, then let out a sound of \"yi\". He looked at the black tea cup in his hand and said, \"Isn't this that black glazed tea cup? The kind popular during the Song Dynasty\u2026\u2026\"Shang Que had previously been silently drinking tea and listening to their conversation. After hearing this, he lifted his gaze and asked in confusion, \"You recognize it?\"Yu Zhengdu was surprised too. \"Dad, when did you learn about tea sets?\"\"Hai, how would I know anything.\" Father Yu shook his hands, \"Today we met at Yu Manjiang's house and I saw the same set there. That Yu Manjiang, he's currently learning the ways of tea, so the cabinets in his house are full of tea leaves and tea sets. He specially took them out for the clansmen to admire and use. One of the kinds he took out was identical to this one. Apparently, he went to a lot of trouble buying it from some kiln and some pottery expert. It's an imitation black glazed tea cup from the Song Dynasty.\"Father Yu pointed at the designs on the cup in his hand. \"Aiyo, it's exactly the same as this one. He even specially introduced it to us, saying this kind is called Rabbit Fur. The craftsmans.h.i.+p is really expensive; he said his set cost over 100,000 RMB.\"\"So specific?\" Yu Zhengdu picked up a tea cup and looked at it left and right. He wasn't able to notice anything out of the ordinary. \"Really?\"Shang Que nodded. \"The one you're holding right now is called Golden Rabbit Fur.\"\"Exactly.\" Father Yu started selling what he had just learned, pretending to be a professional. \"These are cla.s.sified as Golden Rabbit Fur or Silver Rabbit Fur by the design and color. Apparently the people of the Song Dynasty liked to have tea fights, and that, uh, what was it\u2026\u2026Which is why they used these black tea sets\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu after seeing his dad use \"what was it\" to finish his completely non-educational explanation: = =Shang Que seemingly couldn't bear to let this conversation go on, so finally spoke up: \"The Song people used very finely ground tea dust to make their tea. When they placed it in the water and stirred, foam would appear. Good teas 'touched the cup but left no watermarks', meaning they wouldn't leave marks on the side of the cups. They used black tea cups because it was easier to tell if there were any markings.\"\"Yes yes yes, exactly.\" Father Yu looked at him in praise, \"It's still Xiao Shang who can explain it clearly. Yu Manjiang talked for half a day, citing cla.s.sics and bringing up ancient literature; I forgot it as soon as I heard it.\"\"\u2026\u2026That's because your cultural background is shoddy,\" Yu Zhengdu scorned, then added, \"And Yu Manjiang too, imitating those high cla.s.s people. As if we won't know who he originally was.\"\"Who knows.\" Father Yu smiled happily at Shang Que. \"I didn't expect for Xiao Shang to know so much seeing as he's so young. So cultured.\"Shang Que looked at this interesting father-son pair and was rendered temporarily speechless. A moment later, he finally squeezed out two words: \"Common knowledge.\"After lunch, Mother Yu shooed Father Yu off to go wash the dishes while she started to prepare the offerings needed.The traditional burial offerings of Jintan Village had been pa.s.sed down from generation to generation. Every year, each family would hand-make some local desserts and fruits. Yu Zhengdu watched as his mom started preparing the filling, and so took the initiative to start kneading the dough.Yu Zhengdu sat next to Shang Que as he kneaded the dough. Shang Que was watching TV, so they chatted occasionally.Mother Yu was on the side preparing the filling for the desserts. She asked Shang Que as she mixed, \"Xiao Shang, what does your hometown normally prepare for Qingming? Tell me, and if I can make it, I'll make some for you too?\"Shang Que was engrossed in a recently popular historical idol drama called\u300aOld Dreams of Bianliang\u300b. When Mother Yu spoke, he was in the middle of vigorously slapping Yu Zhengdu's thigh and yelling, \"What is this stupid screenwriter! How could you do that during the Song Dynasty! And that background scenery, those clothes, their eating utensils, none of them are right!!!\"Yu Zhengdu covered his thigh. \"\u2026\u2026Can you hit lighter.\"Shang Que took his hand back, but felt that this wasn't good enough yet. He also took out his phone: \"This plot is too exaggerated. I'm going to go online to cuss out the screenwriter!!!\"Mother Yu couldn't help laughing at his angry expression as he watched TV and teased, \"Xiao Shang must be a history major, otherwise how would he know the drama is wrong?\"Shang Que hrmph'd. \"This is all common knowledge, the screenwriter is an idiot!\"Mother Yu: \"\u2026\u2026\" The handsome young man is really very unreasonable.She smiled, then repeated her previous question.This time Shang Que finally heard her. He looked a little lost, then pointed directly at the TV. \"Then make me some date cakes like the ones in there.\"Mother Yu: \"\u2026\u2026\" Weren't you just cussing out the screenwriter?Yu Zhengdu looked at Boss, then looked at his mom who was now in a tough spot. He very resolutely took out his phone and searched up a recipe. He sent it over to her, and said, \"Mom, jiayou.\"Mother Yu: \"\u2026\u2026Fine.\"A moment later, Yu Zhengdu finished kneading the dough. Mother Yu looked at Shang Que who was deeply engrossed in the TV drama and nodded in her son's direction. \"We're still missing some paper money and incense at home. Go out and buy some, and take Xiao Shang out to walk around a bit while you're at it.\"Yu Zhengdu agreed, then pulled at Shang Que. \"Xiao Shang, let's go buy some things.\"Shang Que swatted his hand away. \"Wait, that Bai Mudan's fake pregnancy is about to be exposed. Let me finish watching!\"Yu Zhengdu: \u2026\u2026Weren't you just cussing out the screenwriter?Finally, the evil supporting female character Miss Bai Mudan's true face became known to the world, and she got kicked out of her home. After this, Shang Que stood up and went with Yu Zhengdu to go shopping, satisfied. Before he left, though, he didn't forget to cuss the screenwriter out on Weibo.Yu Zhengdu took out a Little Sheep electric motorbike and swung a leg on, then patted the backseat. He said to Shang Que, \"Get on, I'll take you for a ride.\"Shang Que stared at the little motorbike for a while before slowly climbing on. His voice was full of dislike. \"I would never ride this kind of transportation device in the past\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu c.o.c.ked an eyebrow. \"You don't understand, this kind of car is the king in our town.\"Shang Que hrmph'd. \"Next time you need to switch to a car with a roof.\"Yu Zhengdu paused for a moment. \"You're already starting to plan for next time?\"Shang Que: \"\u2026\u2026\" A little upset, how come it just came out of my mouth!At least Yu Zhengdu managed to immediately continue the conversation. \"Fine fine fine, next time I'll get an umbrella to cover the top of this car.\"Shang Que hummed.Ten minutes later, Shang Que said as he hugged Yu Zhengdu's waist, \"Drive faster. This is so fun.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026I'm about to get jolted to death, we really can't go any faster.\"Jintan Village was your typical 38th tier little town. The town center was comprised of what had previously been the old village; all the houses here had grey roofs and grey walls. After the innermost circle of old houses were those a cross between urban and rural styles, built in the 80s and 90s.The roads were a mess too, especially those in the town center that had not been maintained in over ten years. They were small and b.u.mpy, and truly the land of the electric motorbikes. But, several traditional old shops were still located in this area.Yu Zhengdu took Shang Que to an incense shop. The shop was an honorable old brand, so everytime the holidays or New Year rolled around, business was exceptionally good. The employees in the shop were all busy, but as soon as they walked in, their outstanding appearance immediately caught the attention of the boss lady.The boss lady urgently finished grabbing the items another customer wanted, then squeezed her way in front of Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que, smiling as she spoke, \"These two young men, you must be shopping for your family?\"Yu Zhengdu nodded, then read off the list of items that Mother Yu wanted to buy.\"We have that, wait a moment.\" The boss lady smoothly grabbed a bag and began filling it with stuff. Not much later, she brought the completely full bag back and said, \"We just got two new s.h.i.+pments of paper money with large denominations. If you burn it for your ancestors, they'll have the most face.\"Yu Zhengdu used to run errands for his mom in the past too, so knew what large denominations meant. He opened the bag and pulled out a wad of paper money to look, then immediately went \"oho\". He laughed, \"Goodness, one of these must be about a million. Aren't you scared about the inflation down under.\"In his hand was a bill of paper money that was largely similar to regular dollar bills, except instead of a real person's face printed on it, there was a picture of the Jade Emperor. On the corner, \"Underworld People's Bank of Huaxia\" was written. The denomination was ridiculous, there were so many 0's after the 1 that Yu Zhengdu almost thought there was no fee necessary for using ink.This type of paper money started appearing when Yu Zhengdu was young. Because it was new and noted the worth of the bill, it quickly became extremely popular. Though it was less popular now, most people still liked to buy a wad to burn as an offering. But as time pa.s.sed, the denomination on the paper money became larger and larger; in the beginning, they only printed hundreds or thousands. Now, they were up to millions.The boss lady said, \"We all burn money like this these days. Even if you're poor, your ancestors can't be poor, right?\"The two started seriously talking about nothing, only for Shang Que to suddenly reach his hand out and grab the paper money from Yu Zhengdu's hand. He took the rest out of the bag too and put them back on the counter. He furrowed his brows, saying, \"We don't need these, just the gold foil yellow paper is fine.\"The boss lady turned to look at this cold young man who had an exceptionally beautiful face. She teased, \"Ey, how could you not want them. Gold foil paper isn't enough; later everyone else's ancestors will be worth over a hundred million, and what will your ancestors do then.\"Shang Que completely ignored the boss lady, turning his head to explain to Yu Zhengdu, \"Those are useless. Just gold foil yellow paper is enough.\"Yu Zhengdu was stunned too, but then realized. The man standing in front of him was the big cheese of the Underworld. In regards to what could be used in the Underworld, who would know more clearly than him?It's all because Boss looks too much like a handsome human!After they walked out of the incense store, Yu Zhengdu didn't immediately head home. Instead, he parked the electric motorbike on the side of the road and took Shang Que to walk down the old alleyway and experience the style of a small village.The road in the old alleyway of Jintan Village was made of cobblestone, and though the surface was uneven, it had a unique style of its own. On both sides of the road were stalls selling all sorts of snacks and knick-knacks, and the street was loud with the bustle of people pa.s.sing by.The two slowly strolled down the cobblestone road. Shang Que's eyes darted to and fro among the goods sold at each stall while he explained the correct way of using Underworld currency to Yu Zhengdu.\"\u2026\u2026There's no production or business in the Underworld, so you can't use money to buy anything. The mortal realm believes that when you burn paper money for your ancestors, it's for them to spend, but this is actually a misunderstanding. Since the early times till now, the purpose of burning paper money was only to portray the faith of the living.\"Both the ghosts and G.o.ds had heavily relied on the mortal realm's belief in them. Compared to sacrificial offerings, what they needed more was the faith of humans.A small question mark popped up on Yu Zhengdu's forehead. \"If that's the case, then we don't need to burn paper money. Wouldn't it be more direct to just send our love?\"The corner of Shang Que's mouth twitched. As if unwilling to respond to his question, he paused before reluctantly continuing, \"\u2026\u2026The gold foil yellow paper of the past was used to bribe the Underworld workers or other ghosts and G.o.ds.\"The G.o.ds in the heavens often liked to cover their statues with gold, but other than using the gold foil from their believers for this purpose, carrying gold foil yellow paper that held the faith of a living person could increase one's cultivation level. Thus, it was popular in the Underworld too.So later on, because of certain misunderstandings, the mortal realm started printing a bunch of strange Underworld currencies. But, if there was no gold foil on it, no matter how large the denomination was, it was useless.\"Before the Underworld collapsed, there was a useless money mountain. Paper money from the mortal realm that didn't meet regulations, silver that had more paper than silver, no matter how much you burn, they're useless in the Underworld. We threw them all onto the useless money mountain.\"Yu Zhengdu was. .h.i.t with sudden epiphany and couldn't help praising, \"You ghosts are really so smart, even having that kind of mountain. Then the scenario of bad money driving out good money won't appear in the Underworld!\"You ghosts\u2026\u2026Bad money driving out good money\u2026\u2026Shang Que glanced at him out of the corner of his eye. \"Please stop summarizing.\"Yu Zhengdu elbowed his Boss and blinked. \"How about this, when our company earns more money, I'll burn you a whole truckload of gold foil. This way you can become a man who truly owns a mountain of gold!\"\"That's not necessary. I already have a mountain of gold.\" Shang Que lifted his chin. The arrogance in his eyes was obvious.Yu Zhengdu was slightly shocked. \"\u2026\u2026Really?\"\"Really\u2026\u2026What's that?\" Shang Que suddenly changed the topic, his eyes staring directly at a little stall on the side of the road.Yu Zhengdu followed his line of sight and looked over to see a local snack known as \"lion candy\". It was made from fried peanut pieces wrapped in caramelized sugar; after the sugar hardened again, it would be shaped into a little lion. They looked exceptionally cute lined up one by one in the stall.The smell of caramelized sugar and fried peanuts mixed in the air to become even more tantalizing, making one secrete saliva faster.But the taste could be described with one word\u2026\u2026oversweet.That was essentially a big lump of sugar and peanuts. And because they were honest about the quant.i.ty of ingredients used, the price was pretty high too. In Yu Zhengdu's mind, this was the equivalent of Jintan Village's local \"rice cakes\".Yu Zhengdu spoke without thinking, \"Ah, rice cakes.\"Shang Que: \"\u2026\u2026?\"\"Ah no, it's lion candy,\" Yu Zhengdu corrected. He furrowed his nose, \"This stuff is grossly sweet. It takes me half a month to finish one lion.\"Shang Que stared at the lion for a while, then raised his chin at Yu Zhengdu. \"Buy one for me.\"Yu Zhengdu: \u2026\u2026Is this something a ghost who has a mountain of gold would say?A lion is only thirty dollars! And he wants the employee to pay!Boss can really bluff!Yu Zhengdu silently pulled out his phone to pay. Shang Que picked up a lion, pleased. Yu Zhengdu was just about to tell him to break a piece off and eat it slowly, bit by bit, only to see Shang Que open his mouth and directly bite the lion's head off.Yu Zhengdu couldn't help but remind him, \"\u2026\u2026Xiao Shang, pay attention to your image!\"The lion's head had to have been around 10 centimeters in diameter. Shang Que held it in his mouth and looked over, his back straight and posture elegant. He asked, \"Ith my image weally bad wight now?\"Yu Zhengdu looked at his cheek that was bulging out because of the lion's head and listened to his lisp. He lied, \"\u2026\u2026Definitely not.\"Shang Que kept the candy lion in his mouth as they continued walking. Soon after, another snack caught his eye. He turned a practiced gaze on Yu Zhengdu, avidly hinting at something.Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026Buy it.\"With a lion candy in his left hand and snacks in his right hand, Shang Que was finally satisfied.Yu Zhengdu saw that he finished the lion's head in only a moment and couldn't help but ask, \"Don't you think it's too sweet?\"Upon hearing his question, Shang Que paused and thought about it, then nodded. \"A little bit. Buy me a bottle of water then.\"Yu Zhengdu: \u2026\u2026Why did he have to ask?He admitted defeat and bought a bottle of water, handing it to Shang Que. \"Here.\"They stared at each other for a moment, and then kept silent.Only to see Shang Que had a lion candy in his left hand and snacks in his right hand. He had no more hands to spare.Yu Zhengdu was just about to say I'll hold your snacks for you when he saw Shang Que open his mouth and go, \"Ah\u2014\u2014\"Yu Zhengdu: I surrender!He kind of wanted to refuse, but Boss was generally quite petty. Who knew if he would keep note of it if he refused.Yu Zhengdu thought about it some more and finally caved under the threat of turning into a chicken. He silently opened the bottle\u2026\u2026but he didn't expect Shang Que to keep doing it. The rest of the way, he stopped every few steps to have him feed him a drink of water!Boss looked quite happy, but he was on the receiving end of pa.s.sersby's strange looks.Sigh, work, is really so difficult.A moment later, they made it to the end of the alley; there was a fork in the road here. The fork led to the residential area and so was harder to walk through.Shang Que had already finished the candy lion and looked like he still wanted more. Yu Zhengdu was scared that if he walked back the way they came, he would want something else, so turned into a small side alley and said, \"Let's take these side roads back, there'll be less people.\"Shang Que didn't mind either way. Without his snacks, he seemed to have lost his soul, and followed mindlessly behind Yu Zhengdu, strolling along slowly.In the front, Yu Zhengdu had just turned onto a small road, when he suddenly went \"yi\" and asked, \"Why is there an old person here?\"Shang Que lazily looked over after hearing this, then slightly narrowed his originally inattentive eyes.They saw on the corner of the little street an old man dressed messily curled up into himself. He leaned against the wall and was sleeping, his hair unkempt; the silvery white hairs also seemed to glow golden. The strands covered his entire face, making it unable to see his appearance.Yu Zhengdu was perplexed. \"I've never seen this person before. Is he from out of town?\"He looked at the old man's head full of white hair and couldn't tell how he had made his way to this village. He felt pity in his heart, so reached into his pocket and dug around before finding some spare change. He then squatted in front of the old man and called out, \"Grandpa, h.e.l.lo.\"A moment later, the old man slowly opened his eyes. He peered at him through his hair, eyes filled with confusion. \"You can see me?\"Yu Zhengdu: ????The old man was just about to say something when someone else squatted in front of him too, a smile that wasn't quite a smile on his face. \"h.e.l.lo, Village G.o.d.\"The next morning, after breakfast, everyone followed Father Yu to the Yu public ancestral temple.The surname Yu was common locally and had a large population. The old village was in the southwest area of Jintan Village, with its cramped houses. The Yu Clan's public ancestral temple was located in the very front of the village. The ancestral hall alone took up a large area of land. If you kept going forward from there, you would see a pond. On the right would be a small temple. It formed a right angle with the public ancestral temple.The temple was home to three G.o.dly figures, the Three G.o.ds that the Yu Clan wors.h.i.+pped.When Yu Zhengdu and them reached their destination, the previously empty area was already filled with people. They naturally stood in a semicircle and were in the middle of several heated discussions. Upon listening closely, the main reason for their battle was whether or not they should remove the public ancestral temple to enlarge the Three G.o.ds Temple.As a village representative, Father Yu walked into the public ancestral temple by himself. Yu Zhengdu and the rest had to squeeze their way to the front of the crowd.They saw that outside the Three G.o.ds Temple and public ancestral temple, an incense table had already been prepared. Aside from offerings, there was also cinnabar and yellow paper placed on the incense table. In the very front, there was a giant incense burner; it had been invited out from inside the Three G.o.ds Temple. There was a giant incense the width of an arm with a length of one meter in the incense burner.Behind the incense table, close to the Three G.o.ds Temple, was a tais.h.i.+ chair that was painted red.Unlike a normal tais.h.i.+ chair, on the seat, back, armrests, or any other part of the chair that could touch the body of this one, were long nails pointed upright. The nails were about a finger's length and were placed sharp side up. The ends glinted ominously in the sunlight.Yu Zhengdu explained to Shang Que, \"The tongji of the Three G.o.ds Temple is naked from the waist up when he does fuluan. If it's successful, he sits on the chair with nails and communicates with a pen and ink.\"This ceremony was a reason why the Yu Clan believed in the Three G.o.ds so much. Unlike other jitongs who communicated with the G.o.ds simply using their mouths, the tongji of the Three G.o.ds Temple had to sit naked on a chair with nails, and those nails were made of real iron. Simply touching one could cause you to bleed, so unless someone was protected by G.o.dly power, how could they safely sit on the chair.But before Yu Zhengdu started working at Luofeng, he always thought that when the tongji performed fuluan, it was some kind of illusion. Thinking back on it now, he was only glad that he wasn't the type of person to run their mouth; even though he never believed in it, he also hadn't publicly displayed disrespect.The corners of Shang Que's mouth lifted in despise. He coldly said, \"Allegedly, real G.o.ds don't possess people. If it so easily possesses someone, how could it be a real G.o.d.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026Don't speak so loud!\"Right now they were surrounded by the believers of the Three G.o.ds!As expected, several villagers heard him and turned around to look at them, rage in their eyes. Someone even directly yelled, \"Where did this person talking bulls.h.i.+t come from!\"Yu Zhengdu sneakily stepped away from Shang Que, then used the same condemning gaze to look over: It was him! I'm innocent!Shang Que furrowed his brows and pulled him back over. \"Why are you standing so far away?\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\"Okay, now the villagers were angry at him too.A moment later, the voices around them slowly died down. Yu Zhengdu looked up, only to see a group of people exit the public ancestral temple. The man leading them was middle-aged and dressed in a suit. Following him were the village representatives and clansmen. In the center of this large group of people was a young Daoist monk.Someone in the crowd said, \"That's the religious man from Minan right. I heard he's a master from Danyang Temple.\"\"It can't be, he looks too young to be a Daoist.\"\"See, you're ill-informed. Apparently this Daoist is extraordinarily talented. Though he looks young, he has seniority. He's the s.h.i.+di of Danyang Temple's temple master. His cultivation level is even higher than the temple master's.\"\"That's him. I heard he's very difficult to invite, and it's only because Old Mr. Yu and the temple master of Danyang Temple are privately acquainted that he reluctantly came on Old Mr. Yu's behalf.\"\"No wonder.\" There was only one person in their town who deserved the t.i.tle \"Old Mr. Yu\" and he was the leader of the clansmen.Yu Zhengdu also explained to Shang Que who the man in the lead wearing a suit was. \"That's Yu Manjiang, the richest man in our town.\"Actually, about 20 years earlier, Yu Manjiang's family was only a regular family with the surname of Yu. Later on, he somehow became exceptionally lucky. Whatever he did was successful, and his riches immediately started piling up. Not long after, he became the richest man in the area; his authority in the village also became much greater.According to Yu Manjiang, this was because he truly believed in the Three G.o.ds and thus received their blessings several times. After he became rich, he also became more faithful. Every year he would donate a considerable amount of money to the Three G.o.ds Temple. The reason they wanted to remove the public ancestral temple and enlarge the Three G.o.ds Temple this time was because he said he had received a message from the Three G.o.ds in his dreams.They watched as Yu Manjiang and the young Daoist spoke for a few minutes, then personally walk into the Three G.o.ds Temple and invite a man with dark skin out. The man wore nothing on his torso. His chest and back were covered with charms drawn on with cinnabar. He was the tongji of the Three G.o.ds Temple.The tongji walked up to the Daoist, clapped his hands together, and bowed. The Daoist hurriedly returned the bow.Following this, Yu Manjiang took a step forward and spoke to everyone gathered below. \"Villagers, I'm sure you all know, a few days ago the Three G.o.ds spoke to me, saying that they wished to enlarge the Three G.o.ds Temple. But there's no suitable empty land in the Old Yu Village, so the only solution is to demolish the public ancestral temple. These are also the Three G.o.ds' orders. As of right now, though, not everyone's opinions are the same, so Old Mr. Yu specially invited Daoist priest Kou from Danyang Temple in Minan. Later, the tongji will invite the Three G.o.ds down, and Daoist priest Kou will communicate with the Three G.o.ds for us. n.o.body has anything against this plan, right.\"Yu Manjiang had quite a bit of authority locally, and his plan was reasonable, so naturally everyone agreed.Only to see Daoist priest Kou walk up to the incense table and bow in the direction of the Three G.o.ds Temple. He chanted a few incantations, then lit the giant incense in the incense burner. He then made a \"please\" gesture towards the tongji.The tongji nodded and walked around the incense table to the chair with nails on it. He began the fuluan ceremony, simultaneously reading the incantations and grabbing a few yellow talismans, burning them into ashes and throwing the ashes into the holy plant water. Then, he made a hand gesture and spoke, \"G.o.ds come down and show your presence, from the left, follow me and turn, from the right, follow me and walk, just as the wind accompanies a fire and helps it soar\u2026\u2026\"Only to hear Shang Que scoff and mock, \"Your village invites G.o.ds using these methods?\"After the tongji began fuluan, the entire plaza had quieted down. Thus, Shang Que's voice was exceptionally noticeable. Everyone followed the sound to look over at him.Shang Que's voice was full of disdain. \"What era is it, still using these unorthodox ways. How aberrant must the G.o.d be?\"Yu Zhengdu's entire body was on high alert. He really wanted to remove himself from Boss's vicinity, but Boss had already notified everyone else that they were on the same side earlier.As expected, someone in the crowd who recognized him began to reprimand him. \"Isn't this the son from Yu Chuan's family?\"\"What were you talking about? You dare to speak bulls.h.i.+t in front of the Three G.o.ds? Do you want to die?\"\"What a sin, these young people really know nothing these days.\"Someone nearby even pushed him. \"Hurry and apologize to the Three G.o.ds to ask for forgiveness, otherwise when they become angry, you'll be in big trouble.\"Yu Zhengdu had his guard down for a moment and was directly pushed out of the crowd, becoming exposed to everyone.The tongji stopped the ceremony too. His face was dark as he looked over and asked, \"Was it you who spoke such lies just now?\"\"Correct.\" Shang Que took a step with his long legs, gracefully making his way out of the crowd.Yu Zhengdu was immediately unimpressed. \"How come you didn't get pushed out of the crowd?\"Shang Que raised an eyebrow. \"They pushed, but missed.\"He scoffed in disdain, \"Mortals.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\"The tongji looked at the two of them and coldly said, \"If you kneel now and apologize to the Three G.o.ds, I can consider asking them for forgiveness on your behalf.\"Shang Que arrogantly glanced at him. His voice was scornful, \"How do you plan on asking for forgiveness? Drinking talisman water, inhaling incense ash, and inviting the G.o.dly power?\"The tongji's face turned dark. His voice was icy, \"Young man, have you read so many books that you've now become stupid? You have been brainwashed by the supposed materialists and scientists, believing that a tongji performing fuluan is only a superst.i.tious activity. You will know how naive you were when I successfully invite the Three G.o.ds here later.\"Shang Que scoffed. \"You're saying your unorthodox methods aren't based on outdated superst.i.tions?\"As soon as he spoke, the crowd in the plaza immediately became displeased, and started making their annoyance known. Yu Manjiang walked over too and glared at Yu Zhengdu. His expression was p.i.s.sed, \"Zhengdu, what are you doing? I know you read a lot of books so now don't believe in this stuff, but to specially hire someone to cause a commotion is too much.\"As he spoke, he turned around to look at Father Yu. \"Yu Chuan, you need to keep an eye on your son.\"Father Yu didn't expect for his son to suddenly charge out, or for his son's coworker to begin lecturing everyone. His face was full of sweat and he urgently said, \"Zhengdu, hurry and apologize to the Three G.o.ds!\"Yu Manjiang also turned to look at Shang Que. \"And you too, thinking you understand the truth just because you got a couple more years of education. You really think the tongji can't successfully invite the G.o.ds?\"Shang Que glanced at him disdainfully. \"Who said that he couldn't invite the G.o.ds? I said, what era is it, to still use these outdated methods, what a joke.\"Yu Manjiang didn't understand what he was saying at first; a couple of question marks popped up above his head.The tongji was confused too. \"What does that mean?\"Shang Que hummed coldly. \"Your G.o.d clearly can't keep up with the times. Still needing to drink talisman water and sit on nails. It wouldn't make a difference whether or not you pay your respects to him.\"The tongji was furious. He kept his rage in and bitterly asked, \"What, you know how to invite G.o.ds too?\"\"Do I need to invite them?\" Shang Que's tone of voice was contemptuous. He looked at Yu Zhengdu, \"Tell him, how do we send messages in the Underworld these days?\"Yu Zhengdu: \u2026\u2026Boss, can you please discuss with me first before you cue me.Thankfully he was someone who had witnessed many things before, so followed his Boss's normal train of thought and stated quite confidently, \"Text messages!\"Shang Que: \"\u2026\u2026\"Actually, he wanted to say that he directly called for the ghosts and then beat them up\u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter Yu Zhengdu spoke, all the villagers exploded, jabbing fingers at them and cussing.Father Yu facepalmed, hard. \"Zhengdu, you're being too disrespectful. Hurry and go home.\"\"He's not going anywhere.\" The old man standing at the very front of the clansmen took a step forward and looked at Yu Zhengdu. He said, \"The youth don't know how high the sky is or how thick the earth is anymore, even daring to speak such blasphemy in front of the Three G.o.ds. If you don't win the Three G.o.ds' forgiveness today, you cannot leave.\"This was the current leader of the clansmen, the only person in the Yu Village who deserved to be called \"Old Mr. Yu\". His words held great weight with the Yu Clan's clansmen, so as soon as he spoke, Father Yu felt his vision go black; there was basically no way out of this anymore.\"Exactly.\" Yu Manjiang added on to Old Mr. Yu's sentence and looked at Father Yu. \"Yu Chuan, how did you teach your kid? How come Zhengdu is like this now, even daring to make such uncouth jokes in front of the Three G.o.ds? Is this something that can be joked about?\"Yu Zhengdu was originally listening, but after seeing Yu Manjiang act so high and mighty while lecturing his dad, he immediately took a step forward and said, \"Uncle Manjiang, I'm not joking.\"Yu Manjiang's face immediately became dark. He yelled, \"You still don't feel any regret?\"Yu Zhengdu ignored him, directly reaching a hand out to dig through Shang Que's pockets.Shang Que: \"\u2026\u2026\"This is too much! He doesn't even warn me before touching me anymore! And he keeps moving his hand around!Yu Zhengdu pulled out Boss's Underworld phone and shoved it in Yu Manjiang's face, saying, \"Our company works in health management and performs scientific removal of evil. This is an Underworld Energy Detector that our company invented. It can effectively examine the circ.u.mstances of when a human is hara.s.sed by a ghost or spirit\u2026\u2026\"Yu Manjiang: \"\u2026\u2026???\"This time Yu Zhengdu really caused a lot of trouble. Everyone present became extremely agitated, and Old Mr. Yu was so angry his hands started shaking. He yelled, \"Yu Chuan, if you can't give us a reasonable explanation today\u2026\u2026\"At this moment, Daoist priest Kou, who had previously remained silent and off to the side, suddenly went \"yi\". He took a few steps forward to stand in front of Yu Zhengdu, then bowed. \"It can't be, are you two from Luofeng Life Management Co. Ltd.?\"Yu Zhengdu was stunned. He didn't know why the supposed youngest priest with the greatest skill of Danyang Temple recognized him, but still nodded. \"Yes.\"\"That's perfect.\" Daoist priest Kou's expression was filled with antic.i.p.ation. He said, \"A little while ago the nation's Daoist a.s.sociation held a seminar. Daoist priest Mu from Diyang's Qinglian Temple shared with us some of his previous experiences capturing ghosts. He introduced us to your company's advanced ghost-catching technology, especially the Underworld energy detection technology you invented. It really opened my eyes; I felt like I could suddenly see the light.\"Daoist priest Kou became more excited the more he talked. \"I originally wanted to find a chance to personally go to Fu City and discuss a scientific way of cultivation with you guys. I didn't expect to be able to meet you at a place like this; what an unantic.i.p.ated surprise.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\"Only to see Shang Que nod, his tone filled with rare praise, \"Not bad, only motivated Daoists are good Daoists.\"The crowd of people had just been so agitated, but hadn't expected for the religious master that Old Mr. Yu had specially invited from Minan to suddenly start having a conversation with Yu Zhengdu, or for his tone to be immensely respectful too. In a moment, they all quieted down.Old Mr. Yu was perplexed as well. He pushed down the displeasure in his chest and politely asked Daoist priest Kou, \"Daoist priest Kou, you know them?\"\"This is our first time meeting, but I've heard of what their company can do.\" Daoist priest Kou briefly relayed Daoist priest Mu's story, then sighed at the end. \"Qinglian Temple's Daoist priest Mu is someone to be respected. His abilities are the benchmark for us. If even he admits defeat, it's clear to see that scientific advancements are the way to go.\"Old Mr. Yu: \"\u2026\u2026\"Yu Manchuan: \"\u2026\u2026\"Everyone else: \"\u2026\u2026\"It must be known that Qinglian Temple was truly one of the nation's biggest and best temples, and Daoist priest Mu was also quite renowned. Reasonably they wouldn't make these things up, but why did the story seem so unscientific\u2026\u2026ah no, too scientific?Old Mr. Yu immediately became bewildered. He looked at Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que, speechless.It was Yu Manchuan who first couldn't hold himself back. He said, \"What a load of bulls.h.i.+t. In my opinion, Daoist priest Mu was scammed. Daoist priest Kou, you religious people don't really interact with society much, so you probably don't know how advanced scammers are these days. It's quite hard to avoid them.\"Daoist priest Kou's expression became pensive. His voice conveyed his disagreement. \"This householder, those who dedicate their lives to Daoism still go on the Internet. I even have a Weibo. Besides, a normal scammer could never be able to accomplish something like capturing a ghost.\"\"Fine, then let's pretend they really can remove evil and catch ghosts.\" Yu Manjiang pointed at Yu Zhengdu with an expression that seemed to say that he didn't want to argue. \"But what they said today isn't about removing evil or catching ghosts. What did they just say? That they can text the G.o.ds? They have that kind of technology?\"This time Daoist priest Kou was rendered mute too. The Underworld Energy Detector was easy to defend, but text messages\u2026\u2026this really seemed a bit far off the map.Shang Que looked at Yu Manjiang out of the corner of his eye. \"It is our technology. Is something wrong?\"This time the tongji became unimpressed too. As the only person in the Yu Clan who could communicate with the G.o.ds, if he continued to let them cause a commotion, how was he going to earn his living anymore? He stepped up and said, \"If that's the case, why don't you show us right now. If you can communicate with the Three G.o.ds, we'll let what happened today go.\"Shang Que tsk'd. \"Your Three G.o.ds are so out of the times, they probably don't even own a phone. To communicate with them you'll have to keep drawing on your body.\"Yu Zhengdu: \u2026\u2026Don't be in such a hurry to disrespect the Three G.o.ds ah, we're still surrounded by the villagers right now!Upon hearing this, the tongji was infuriated, as expected. Seeing his evasion of the task, he believed that he had found the crack in their scam, so was just about to start raging when Shang Que casually said, \"How about switching to contacting a ghost. Did someone die in your family recently, I can help you send a text over.\"Tongji: !!! They're clearly cursing me!Yu Zhengdu saw the tongji's dark face become red with anger, so hurriedly started mediating. \"This is the Underworld communication technology that our company invented; you can contact people who have already pa.s.sed with it. If you and the deceased have some incomplete business, we can help you relay that.\"Their surroundings: \"\u2026\u2026\" These two people were insane, right!\"That's enough, stop arguing.\" At this crucial moment, Old Mr. Yu stepped up again to maintain the situation. He looked at Daoist priest Kou. There was nothing to be said about his abilities, but he probably was like Yu Manjiang said, not delving into society enough and easily scammed. Yet he couldn't humiliate Daoist priest Kou to his face, as he ultimately had Danyang Temple behind him. This mess couldn't carry on either, it needed to be resolved quickly and neatly. The easiest way was to use reality.Old Mr. Yu told Yu Zhengdu, \"If that's the case, then can you guys please send a text to my deceased wife.\"As soon as Old Mr. Yu said this, the crowd went into an uproar.Yu Manjiang immediately disagreed. \"Elder Yu, how can you let these two scammers have their way!\"Father Yu was a little nervous and wanted to stop them, only to see Old Mr. Yu wave his hands and solemnly state, \"But I'm going to make this clear. If Zhengdu can't contact my deceased wife today, he must be removed from the clan.\"Father Yu: \"Old Mr. Yu, thas isn't\u2026\u2026\"At the same time, Yu Zhengdu nodded. \"Okay.\"Father Yu felt his vision go black. His entire body started shaking. \"Zhengdu, are you trying to make me die from anger!\"\"Dad, don't get so excited first.\" Yu Zhengdu was actually quite exasperated too, the situation had escalated out of his control. The only thing he could do now was hurry and act first. He had no time to explain in detail to his dad, so only looked at Old Mr. Yu and asked, \"Old Mr. Yu, can you please tell me what you want to say to your wife?\"Old Mr. Yu's gaze was slightly depressed. He said, \"My wife pa.s.sed away half a year ago. Her biggest regret before pa.s.sing was not being able to see our granddaughter get married. Originally, she already finished preparing our granddaughter's dowry. She was so close, so close\u2026\u2026\"Here, his voice automatically started to tremble. \"My granddaughter is getting married next month. My wife was planning on giving her a jade ring pa.s.sed down from her side of the family for generations. But she left so soon that she didn't manage to tell us, and none of us know where the ring is so we can't find it. This is our family's biggest regret. If you can really contact the Underworld, please help me ask her.\"At this, Old Mr. Yu's eyes became completely red.Many people present knew about their family's misfortune. When she was alive, Old Mr. Yu and his wife were deeply in love. They were practically the village's model couple. Upon hearing this, they all sighed.Simultaneously, many people were even more outraged. They thought about Old Mr. Yu having to reminisce this tragedy because of these two scammers; it was the equivalent of stabbing a knife into the old man's heart again. How were they going to rectify this situation?Yu Zhengdu was moved too. He deeply inhaled, then said, \"Okay Old Mister. Please wait.\"Honestly speaking, this task was the easiest for them\u2026\u2026To make management easier, Luofeng automatically transformed each person's ID card number into their phone number after death.Yu Zhengdu asked Old Mr. Yu for his wife's ID number, then used Shang Que's phone to type up a message and send it. As he sent it he also spoke, \"Old Mister please wait. As long as Old Missus hasn't already reincarnated yet, we'll definitely be able to get in contact with her. I'm just worried she may be busy right now.\"Old Mr. Yu made a noise of acknowledgment. There was no change to his expression, but his palms couldn't help slightly trembling. He actually didn't trust Yu Zhengdu at all, but the previous conversation made him remember his life with his wife. Though he clearly knew this was all a farce, he couldn't help antic.i.p.ating something.Yu Manjiang had been patiently watching his performance, but now couldn't help scoffing. \"What now? Are you going to say in a moment that Old Missus has already reincarnated so you can't contact her? You have quite a bit of tricks up your sleeve\u2026\u2026\"Before he finished speaking, Yu Zhengdu's eyes lit up. He laughed, \"Old Missus's typing speed is quite fast, she's already replied.\"Yu Manjiang: \"\u2026\u2026\"Everyone present: \"\u2026\u2026\"Yu Manjiang refused to believe him, pointing in his direction and saying, \"What blasphemy. Don't think that you can randomly find someone to respond to your message and fool us!\"Old Mr. Yu shook his hands, signalling for him to be quiet. Then he looked at Yu Zhengdu and calmly stated, \"If that's the case, then read it for us to hear.\"Yu Zhengdu nodded and read, \"Stupid old man, how did you contact Luofeng to send me a text? Did you die too? If you've died hurry and come find me, I'm at\u2026\u2026 Aiya, this part got censored.\"Yu Zhengdu looked at Boss in confusion. Shang Que said, \"The secrets of the Heavens mustn't be revealed. If the information contains anything about the secrets of the Underworld, it'll automatically be censored out.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026Yi? I never noticed before.\"\"Censoring out secrets? I can write a hundred of these types of texts,\" Yu Manjiang mocked. \"If you're going to make something up at least make it more realistic. You didn't even do your research. Who doesn't know that Old Mrs. Yu was gentle and mannerly. She was normally the most refined, how could she use a nickname like 'stupid old man'?\"Upon hearing this, Yu Zhengdu became nervous too. \"It can't be. Did I send it to the wrong person?\"Yu Manjiang was about to mock him again, only to hear Old Mr. Yu suddenly speak up, \"You continue, continue\u2026\u2026\"Everyone looked over to discover that for some unknown reason, Old Mr. Yu was extremely excited.Yu Manjiang: \"\u2026\u2026???\"Yu Zhengdu didn't understand why, but still continued to read. The latter half was Old Mrs. Yu explaining where the ring was. He perused it and summarized, \"Old Missus says that when she was alive she worried that n.o.body would be able to find it after she died, so she placed the ring in the cabinet of your granddaughter's room. It's in the innermost location of the third shelf.\"As he read, he complained to himself: Old Missus's line of thought is truly strange. If anything happened to her, any normal person would first go look in her room. Who would expect her to place it there\u2026\u2026After hearing this, Old Mr. Yu immediately called home. His granddaughter was preparing for the wedding so wasn't at the gathering today; he told her to go look for the ring following these instructions. Not long after, Old Mr. Yu hung up and stared at Yu Zhengdu, stunned.His gaze was too dazed. Everyone present already believed that Yu Zhengdu and them were from a scamming company, so naturally interpreted Old Mr. Yu's expression to be the displeasure and anger of being lied to.Yu Manjiang didn't hesitate at all, declaring on the spot, \"Yu Chuan, from today on, your son must be removed from our clan\u2026\u2026\"\"No no\u2014\u2014\" Old Mr. Yu excitedly shouted, then leapt in Yu Zhengdu's direction. \"We found the ring; the information was all accurate. Zhengdu, can you please send another text for me, I still have many things I want to say to my wife.\"Yu Manjiang: \"\u2026\u2026????\"Shang Que lunged forward with his long legs and hid Yu Zhengdu behind him. He gazed coldly at Old Mr. Yu. \"That was just a test trial. If you want to actually use this service, you must pay.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\"Has Boss's transformation into a profiteer not been a little too fast?The author has something to say:Ghost King: Being polite is impossible \u2190_\u2190The aim of our new h.e.l.l is: getting listed on the stock market\u2014\u2014Bonus chapter for Halloween!! Woohoo!! Cause what's Halloween without ghosts? ?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs soon as Old Mr. Yu finished speaking, the people watching immediately burst into a sudden uproar. All of their faces had expressions of shock.The most stunned was Yu Manjiang. He couldn't release the anger he had been holding, so froze in place. After a while, he finally regained his wits and slowly reached over to steady Old Mr. Yu. \"Elder Yu, don't be fooled by them. This is all a scam. Who knows if they didn't plan this earlier and get information from some unknown place. Think about it, if Old Missus really sent the text, would she call you, what was it\u2026\u2026'stupid old man'?\"Yu Manjiang's words weren't completely unbelievable. Everyone knew that in life, Old Mrs. Yu was the most elegant and mannerly. In front of others, she never even showed her teeth when she smiled, so couldn't possibly use such a vulgar nickname to call Old Mr. Yu.As soon as he brought this up, everyone naturally remembered this. They suddenly became more suspicious of Yu Zhengdu.Only to see Old Mr. Yu, who was normally gentle and well-spoken, slightly freeze. A blush even rose on his usually strict face. He hesitated for quite a bit before saying in embarra.s.sment, \"That's because you guys don't know. My wife wasn't an elegant person in private, she only acted that way in public. Not only has she called me stupid old man, she also used to tug on my ears all the time\u2026\u2026\"Everyone: \"\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\"It was over, this time it was really over. They never imagined that Old Mrs. Yu's true appearance was like this.They also never imagined that the image she had carefully crafted throughout her lifetime would be ruined in this manner after death.But this whole affair proved the credibility of Yu Zhengdu's text even more. They couldn't have known what the already deceased Old Mrs. Yu was truly like in life, right? Their whole village had been in direct contact with Old Mrs. Yu for her entire lifetime and still didn't know anything.The crowd started a heated discussion:\"Is it real? They really have this kind of technology?\"\"It's just a scam. I don't believe it.\"\"How is it a scam? Didn't you hear what Old Mr. Yu said? Even their family members didn't know where that ring was, how could a scammer point it out so easily?\"\"Isn't that right. They even knew how Old Mrs. Yu called others in private. This scamming technique is too advanced, even if you get scammed by them you're not missing out.\"\"I think it's impossible. Where would they get this kind of communication technology? Contacting the Underworld without having to cast spells, are you kidding me?\"\"Why is it impossible. In ancient times they didn't have phones, lights, or TVs, but didn't someone invent them eventually?\"\"Makes sense. If even the mortal realm can invent a telephone, then there must be that kind of genius in the Underworld too!\"\"Exactly. After the scientists died, they could continue their experiments in the Underworld!\"Not soon after, without Yu Zhengdu needing to explain, the villagers had already completely discussed the possibility of messaging the Underworld.Yu Manjiang's words got blocked by this scene. His entire face became green.Old Mr. Yu's att.i.tude had completely changed. He looked at Shang Que and Yu Zhengdu with teary eyes, \"As long as you guys are willing to send my wife texts, I'm willing to pay whatever you charge.\"\"Uh, Old Mister please don't say that\u2026\u2026\" Yu Zhengdu became very troubled too. Their original intent was only to speak up about the Three G.o.ds' tyranny, but he didn't expect for the situation to somehow escalate into the current scenario.He could only say\u2026\u2026Boss really has talent in becoming a capitalist!But at least Shang Que very quickly spoke up. He glanced at Old Mr. Yu and said, \"The living communicating with the deceased could reveal the secrets of the Heavens. It's not something that can be done if you just pay some money.\"Yu Zhengdu hurriedly nodded. \"Exactly. This is the same concept as the tongji performing divination to ask the G.o.ds questions. You can't just text when you want to text.\"He paused, then added, \"Our technology is only a little more advanced. The taboos of communicating with the Underworld can't be resolved yet using the technology we have now.\"The look in Old Mr. Yu's eyes was bewildered, but he refused to give up. \"Then, then what can I do? I really want to speak to my wife again. Please, no matter what, you must help me send another message.\"Following his words, others in the crowd started shouting as well, \"I want to send a message too!\"\"I want to try too.\"Everyone seemed to be quite curious about this technology; they all wanted to try.Yu Zhengdu looked at Boss, troubled, only to see Shang Que respond arrogantly, \"I'll think about it.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\" As expected, Boss still has such an aura!Right then, a cold gust of wind suddenly appeared out of nowhere, causing the previous uproar to immediately quiet down. Everyone who had just been making a fuss about wanting to send a text froze, asking in confusion, \"What's going on? Why is the wind suddenly so strong?\"At the same time, the incense on the incense table started burning intensely. A stream of white smoke rose directly into the clouds, completely unaffected by the wind.The tongji who had long since been forgotten by the crowd suddenly started shaking too. His eyes started rolling up and his expression was one of great pain. He cried out in surprise and fear, \"It's the Three G.o.ds. The Three G.o.ds have appeared!\"After this, he lunged to stand in front of the incense table, and first drank the previously prepared cup of talisman water in one gulp, then urgently started reciting the incantation, chanting, \"G.o.ds come down and show your presence, from the left, follow me and turn, from the right, follow me and walk, just as the wind accompanies a fire and helps it soar\u2026\u2026\"After he finished reading the incantation, the candle flames on the incense table surged higher with a \"hong\u2014\u2014\". The tongji's eyes became completely white as he let out a deep roar and jumped to sit on the chair with nails.The nails were long and sharp, glinting coldly in the sunlight. The tongji was naked from the waist up, but upon sitting so hard on the chair, nothing happened to his skin at all. He aggressively lifted his head and yelled angrily, \"What miniscule beings dare to speak such blasphemy to mislead the crowd.\"The voice was low and rough, and everyone felt as if an immensely heavy weight had been placed onto their hearts. But the voice was completely different from the tongji's original voice.The crowd immediately went hongran and screamed:\"The Three G.o.ds, the Three G.o.ds have appeared!\"\"The Three G.o.ds are speaking!\"The commotion was somewhat panicked in nature. It must be known that in the history of the Yu Clan, ever since the Three G.o.ds Temple had been erected, the Three G.o.ds rarely spoke. They only ever possessed the tongji to write with cinnabar on yellow paper what they wanted to communicate. This was everyone's first time witnessing the Three G.o.ds speak, and they sounded extremely displeased, so everyone felt uncertain.Yu Manjiang was the first to respond. He bent his knees on the spot and knelt, shouting, \"Yu Manjiang greets the Three G.o.ds.\"With his start, the rest of the people at the plaza also knelt, yelling in sync, \"We greet the Three G.o.ds.\"Daoist priest Kou was a religious master from an official, large temple and thus didn't wors.h.i.+p little G.o.ds from Underworld temples. So though he didn't kneel, he placed his hands together and bowed politely, \"Greetings to the Three G.o.ds.\"Only Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que remained standing straight upright. Among a crowd of people kneeling, they were quite obvious. Shang Que even scoffed, \"It doesn't even have a phone, and needs to possess a body to speak. This G.o.d is really quite broke.\"Yu Zhengdu couldn't help but look at his broke-a.s.s boss from the corner of his eye: \u2026\u2026Really want to say that you don't have much either.The tongji slammed a hand on the incense table, eyes as big as copper coins. His voice changed again, as if a different person had possessed him, and he pointed at Shang Que. \"How dare you miniscule beings offend the G.o.ds. Today we three brothers will show you the might of the G.o.ds. We will take off years of your life as a warning to others to respect us.\"Following the tongji's words, the large incense started burning faster, and the smoke blew directly upward, into the clouds.Yu Manjiang and the Three G.o.ds had always had a close relations.h.i.+p. Upon witnessing this, he immediately lowered his head and recited, \"The incense steadily responds to the universe, fragrance burning through the Heavenly doorway, the jitong opens his mouth, please tell disciple what is right and wrong.\"After this, he turned around and told Shang Que, \"I already tried to warn you guys earlier not to try your tricks in front of the Three G.o.ds. Now you've caused the Three G.o.ds to become angry. Hurry and kneel to admit your wrongs.\"In his imagination, the Three G.o.ds appearing in front of the crowd and the miracle right in front of their eyes should cause Shang Que and Yu Zhengdu to be so scared that they would p.i.s.s themselves.But he saw that the two were still standing proudly, especially Shang Que, who only glanced in that direction before lightly spitting out two words, \"Fake G.o.d.\"As soon as he spoke, everyone in the crowd's expression changed.No matter what, the Yu Clan had still wors.h.i.+pped the Three G.o.ds for hundreds of years; their faith was deeply ingrained in their beings. Now that the Three G.o.ds had appeared, there was extreme pressure in everyone's hearts. Upon seeing Shang Que act so disrespectful, they were all surprised, scared, and angry, but didn't dare to speak up.Only to see the tongji forcefully stand up and shout, outraged, \"What did you say?\"There was scorn in Shang Que's eyes, and his lips curved in a mocking smile. \"An Underworld temple built in the mortal realm, wors.h.i.+pping ghosts. You were never considered true G.o.ds\u2026\u2026\"Following his words, the tongji's face slowly became twisted.When the living died and had temples and statues erected for them in the mortal realm, these temples were called Underworld temples. The true beings being wors.h.i.+pped in these temples were ghosts and not G.o.ds, but if they received enough incense, they could possibly gain the recognition of the Heavens and officially join the G.o.dly ranks. But when compared to the true G.o.ds, they were always one step lower.Shang Que's words directly hit the Three G.o.ds' sore spot.He continued to dig the knife in deeper, saying, \"Originally, the mortal realm wors.h.i.+pped you three, so you should have equally protected this land. But now, to satisfy your selfish desires, you have disregarded your wors.h.i.+ppers' welfares. How embarra.s.sing.\"Shang Que's words could be considered too harsh. The tongji's expression immediately changed, and his voice was suddenly all three of their voices. \"How dare you, miniscule being. You dare to desecrate the G.o.ds.\"\"Today we will kill you, right now.\"Following their horrifying and twisted voices, the wind became even stronger. The tongji's face slowly became black and his hair began standing straight up. His appearance was extremely monstrous.Father Yu urgently said, \"Zhengdu, you and Xiao Shang hurry and apologize to the Three G.o.ds\u2014\u2014\"But Daoist priest Kou's eyebrows slightly furrowed. His gaze on the tongji seemed hesitant. He said, \"Something seems a little wrong\u2026\u2026\"Shang Que remained unmoved in the wind. His voice was low and his message could be heard by everyone. \"You have already fallen into demonish ways. You no longer deserve the incense and faith of the mortal realm\u2026\u2026\"Upon hearing this, Daoist priest Kou's heart skipped a beat. He immediately started calculating with his hands.At the same time, Yu Zhengdu took out his phone and opened the Underworld Energy Detection program. He pointed it at the tongji and scanned, then let out a loud \"f.u.c.k\": \"What kind of G.o.d is this. There's such a strong presence of Underworld energy!\"Daoist priest Kou who was in the middle of calculating: \"\u2026\u2026\"He slowly lowered his hands and inched over next to Yu Zhengdu. He peered over and asked, \"Is this\u2026\u2026\"\"Yes.\" Yu Zhengdu turned the phone so the screen was more in his line of sight. \"This is our company's Underworld Energy Detector. You can see that the tongji's entire body is covered in Underworld energy, and the numbers are off the charts. Where can you find such a wrong G.o.d!\"Daoist priest Kou looked at the a.n.a.lysis result on the bottom of the screen: Underworld energy levels have surpa.s.sed our current measuring range and are higher than the levels a.s.sociated with possession by a malicious ghost. An error may have occurred; please redo the examination.\"As expected, your Underworld energy detection method is simple and fast,\" Daoist priest Kou's voice was filled with obvious envy, then his expression changed. \"It seems like the Three G.o.ds have actually fallen into demonish ways, or else they wouldn't be surrounded by so much Underworld energy.\"When he finished talking, he suddenly whipped out a copper coin sword from around his waist, then turned to face the tongji and spoke solemnly, \"Everyone, the Three G.o.ds have fallen into demonish ways. If we don't get rid of them now, they may become a threat and disrupt everyone's peace. Can you all please immediately head home as I defeat this demon monster\u2014\u2014\"Yu Manjiang was furious. He forcefully stood up and shouted, \"What utter bulls.h.i.+t. The Yu Clan has wors.h.i.+pped the Three G.o.ds for hundreds of years, how is it possible that they are demons. Daoist priest Kou, what a waste of your religious master t.i.tle, even believing those two presumptuous youths. Aren't you scared of the Three G.o.ds punis.h.i.+ng you?\"Before Daoist priest Kou could speak, the tongji spoke up first. \"Too late. Those who have disrespected us must be punished today.\"The candle fire on the incense table leapt up, lighting up the tongji's face that was slowly becoming more and more grotesque.Shang Que tsk'd: \"Too ugly.\"He stepped forward, about to take action, when his arm was suddenly pulled by someone. He turned around, only to see Yu Zhengdu sneakily come closer and lowly ask, \"Boss, the enemy looks very strong. Can you handle him?\"Shang Que thought about it. \"A small demon like him, I could eat three in one bite.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu calmly persuaded him, \"Please consider everyone's mental endurance abilities. Don't eat the demon right now.\"Shang Que was a reasonable boss. Upon hearing this, he really stopped and moved his ear closer to Yu Zhengdu. \"Then what do you want me to do?\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\" Ah, so mad, even Boss's ear is this good looking!Yu Zhengdu pressed his hands together. \"Please be lowkey. I still need to go home and be a human.\"He struggled a bit, before learning forward to whisper in Boss's ear. \"How about you take the Three G.o.ds to go. Bring them home for a midnight snack.\"Shang Que side-eyed him and paused. \"\u2026\u2026I'm scared they'll spoil.\"The two chatted like there was no one else around them, which p.i.s.sed the tongji, who was watching them, off. His eyes rolled behind his head, leaving only whites, and his right arm pointed to the sky. \"Wait until I bring down the might of the G.o.ds to take your invaluable life\u2014\u2014\"\"This isn't good. These two householders, please hurry and take a step back.\" Daoist priest Kou had been anxiously watching the scene unfold. Now he took a step forward and hid Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que behind him. He held up a copper coin sword with one hand and threw out talismans with the other, then closed his eyes to chant, \"Demon king be controlled, serve me Xuan, remove the evil spirits, Daoism prevails\u2026\u2026\"The copper coin sword trembled, making gentle noises.The cold wind grew stronger, causing great alarm.Old Mr. Yu was unsteady on his feet due to the strong winds. His voice shook as he asked, \"Daoist priest Kou, what's happening?\"Yu Zhengdu reached over to steady him. \"Old Mister, the Three G.o.ds have already fallen into demonish ways. You need to tell everyone to leave, or they might be harmed.\"Old Mr. Yu was in disbelief. \"What? How can that be\u2026\u2026\"Everyone's faces were in pain from the gusts of cold wind. In panic, they looked towards Old Mr. Yu.Yu Zhengdu said, \"A real G.o.d would never want to take over the ancestral temple of the mortal realm. Besides, the presence of Underworld energy is so strong, how could a true G.o.d possibly be this way?\"As soon as he brought this up, Old Mr. Yu couldn't help but be reminded of memories from long ago. When he was still a young child, he had the fortune of witnessing a miracle. The Three G.o.ds had revealed themselves then, and truly were as bright as the sun and moon, honest and true in appearance. The tongji then had worn a kind expression, completely unlike what had appeared today.His heart skipped a beat, and he trembled as he stood up and yelled at the crowd, \"Everyone please take cover. Be careful not to get hurt\u2026\u2026\"He still felt a bit uncertain, so didn't dare to directly say that the Three G.o.ds had fallen into demonish ways.Yu Manjiang's face was red with anger. He stomped his feet, \"Elder Yu, how come even you are also\u2026\u2026\"Old Mr. Yu was extremely respected among the Yu Clan's clansmen. As soon as he spoke, everyone became hesitant. They subconsciously wanted to leave, but for some reason, it felt as if their knees had been filled with lead. They couldn't move at all.He heard Daoist priest Kou breathe out a long exhale. \"There is no more magic in the mortal realm. I ultimately can't borrow the power of the G.o.ds\u2026\u2026\"With a clink, the red strings on the copper coin sword all broke. The copper coins fell to the ground, one by one, and Daoist priest Kou was forced to take several steps back, his face pale.They looked again to see the tongji's face had become blackish-purplish; his hair stood up like steel needles, and two gruesome fangs appeared in his mouth. The image was identical to that of demons in the picture books.After witnessing this scene, everyone had no other choice but to believe that the Three G.o.ds had fallen into demonish ways. Daoist priest Kou held his breath and yelled, \"Everyone hurry and run\u2014\u2014hurry and run\u2014\u2014\"But they couldn't move their legs at all. Uncontrollable terror caused almost everyone to lose their minds.At this time, a flash of lightning cut across the sky.Someone lifted their head just in time to see Shang Que confidently walking forward in the direction of the tongji.Daoist priest Kou was extremely anxious, urgently saying, \"Householder Shang, hurry and come back. This is too dangerous!\"Yu Zhengdu's heart was in his throat too, but at such a crucial moment, it was important to pretend be calm. He waved his hands around and said, \"Don't worry, we have already reported the situation here in a text to the Underworld. They've promised to lend us some magic to help in casting spells.\"Daoist priest Kou: \"\u2026\u2026\"Only to see Shang Que limply lift his hand and throw out a magical seal, cussing out loud, \"Trashy fake G.o.d. Immediately kneel and apologize.\"Daoist priest Kou was shocked. \"\u2026\u2026You use your magical seals like that?\"It must be known that ever since he started learning the ways of the Dao, he had always bathed and perfumed himself, meditated and prayed before borrowing the power of the G.o.ds. Magical seals were the treasure of each sect, so needed to be used with the utmost respect, as if they were the G.o.ds themselves. Who dared to throw them out so casually\u2026\u2026Yu Zhengdu hurriedly made up an excuse for Boss. \"Those who work with the Internet are a bit more casual.\"Daoist priest Kou was speechless but also very worried. He said, \"But there is very little magical energy left in the mortal realm. How much power can you borrow using a magical seal?\"Only to hear the roar of thunder as thunder fire fell from the sky and struck the incense table in front of the tongji. The table broke in half and caught on fire, lighting up the entire plaza.A second round of thunder fire followed, landing in the Three G.o.ds Temple and causing the Three G.o.ds statue to fall over, cracking into a million pieces.The large incense snapped in the middle and the incense burner broke in half. All the incense ash was swept away by the wind.The burning fire surrounded the tongji, trapping him inside. The cold gust of wind mysteriously stopped. Shang Que stood there, disdainful as usual, with his hands behind his back. \"Apologize.\"The tongji's hair that had previously stood up like steel needles now wilted. His sharp teeth shrank down too, and his blackish-purplish face became a ghastly white.Immediately following, they fell on the ground, kneeling to grovel, \"Don't don't don't, don't strike me with the thunder fire. I'll never do it again\u2014\u2014\"And then his voice changed. \"It's all my big brother's fault. My big brother was greedy and I couldn't control him!\"After this another voice appeared. \"Stop trying to dodge responsibility. All three of us decided this together, don't think you can push it all onto me!\"The three voices kept switching in the tongji's body, taking turns insulting the others. Soon after, they even started slapping their own face: \"I'll beat you to death!\"\"I'll hit you two!\"\"Bring it on, who's afraid of who? Don't think I don't know about you secretly hiding the gold yuanbaos!\"Everyone at the scene: \"\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026????\"Yu Manjiang: \"\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026????\"As for the most tragic, that was definitely the tongji.Daoist priest Kou was stunned. He stared at Yu Zhengdu and could barely complete his sentence. \"How did you, you guys borrow the thunder fire?\"And two at that!Yu Zhengdu put his phone away and responded very humbly. \"Technology is changing the world. Communications technology is allowing us to contact other worlds with greater frequencies, so our collaboration is much simpler and more effective.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFor a split second, Daoist priest Kou felt a deep suspicion that everything he had learned about the world in the past twenty-something years was all fake.He looked at the copper coin sword that was now in pieces on the ground, and exhaled from the deepest part of his heart. He felt the same as Daoist priest Mu and his disciple. \"Cultivation also needs to keep up with the times and improve along with technology\u2026\u2026\"Over there, the tongji was still simultaneously arguing with himself and slapping himself. In only a moment, his face had become swollen.Yu Zhengdu couldn't take it anymore, so yelled for them to stop, \"Hurry and stop! Don't think I don't realize that you're hitting the tongji. If you keep this up, I'm going to beat you guys!\"At this, the tongji finally sulkily stopped, but the three brothers possessing him continued to take turns speaking and cursing at each other, causing everyone around them to feel quite disillusioned.Who knew that the Three G.o.ds they had wors.h.i.+pped for all this time were like this?Everyone stood up under Yu Zhengdu's direction, but the strangeness of the whole situation still perplexed all of them. They were also terrified by the supernatural scene they had just witnessed, so didn't dare to even make a peep at this time.Only to hear Shang Que coldly say, \"Speak.\"No one else felt it, but in the moment that he opened his mouth to speak, the Three G.o.ds felt a horrifying pressure upon them. Now, they finally realized that the person in front of them could definitely do much more than simply borrow thunder fire.The tongji's teeth clinked as they chattered together. He stumbled out, \"We'll speak, we'll speak right now\u2026\u2026\"\"Us three brothers had a temple and statue erected for us by the Yu Clan in the year of Yongle. We received the Yu Clan's wors.h.i.+p, so for hundreds of years, we dedicated all our efforts to protecting their descendants, never daring to slack off\u2026\u2026\"The three brothers took turns speaking, slowly explaining the events that had occurred after they fell into demonish ways. The people finally learned the truth.It turned out that the three brothers were extremely well respected when they were alive. After death, a temple was also erected in wors.h.i.+p of them; they enjoyed the sacrificial offerings of the mortal realm. In the beginning, they remained the same as in life, bringing rain and protecting the area. Thus, they were well liked by the Yu Clan. In the time that they received the most incense offerings, though they were technically from an Underworld temple, they were recognized by the Heavens and became G.o.ds.But after joining the G.o.dly ranks, they discovered that they belonged to the lowest level of G.o.ds. Though they had incense fire offerings, they held no true position. This was doubtless a hard blow to take for the three brothers who had been respected all their lives.A refusal to resign to this fate blossomed in their hearts, but because they were under the control of the Heavenly Court, they didn't dare to act out. Because of this, things remained the same for hundreds of years. They received the incense offerings of the people and protected them.All until 50 years ago, when the heavens and earth collapsed. The true G.o.ds were destroyed along with the Heavenly Court; it was instead the little G.o.ds stationed in the mortal realm who were spared. The Three G.o.ds belonged to this category of lucky little G.o.ds.After being freed from the control of the Heavenly Court, they still had an abundance of incense offerings from the mortal realm. Thus, the darkness that had been hidden for hundreds of years in the Three G.o.ds' hearts rapidly grew. They not only fell into demonish ways, but also took advantage of their larger number of wors.h.i.+ppers to chase away the Village G.o.d of Jintan Village and take his offerings.Which was to say, for the past few decades, all the offerings the people of Jintan Village had given to the other G.o.ds had been taken by the Three G.o.ds.The greed of the Three G.o.ds grew larger and larger, until they couldn't be satisfied by their tiny temple anymore. They then requested to demolish the Yu Clan's public ancestral temple to enlarge their own temple in order to receive the same treatment as true G.o.ds.With the pressure Shang Que put on them, the Three G.o.ds didn't dare to lie. They honestly relayed their experiences, except for the part about the heavens and earth collapsing, which Shang Que didn't let them say. They only vaguely went over how the Heavenly Court was lazy and thus let them do as they wanted.After hearing their entire account, everyone present remained speechless for a long time, sighing in their hearts.The Three G.o.ds had truly protected them once, but ultimately couldn't hold onto their initial heart. They let selfish desires invade their minds, and finally fell victim to demonish ways.Tragic, and also a pity.After the Three G.o.ds explained their experiences, they once again buried their head in the ground like an ostrich, terrified that Shang Que would try to make eye contact. They begged, \"We've already relayed all our wrongs, please forgive us.\"Upon seeing the previously respected Three G.o.ds now so abject, the villagers of the Yu Clan ultimately couldn't bear it. Old Mr. Yu bowed at Shang Que. \"Though the Three G.o.ds made mistakes, they are still the ancestors of the Yu Clan. Can you allow us to choose what to do with them?\"He felt a little comical saying this. He never expected that in all his years of life, he would one day be begging someone to forgive a G.o.d.Shang Que laughed coldly. \"The ancestors of your Yu Clan are biased.\"Old Mr. Yu didn't understand what he meant, only to see Shang Que lower his eyes to look at the tongji. \"Be honest. Tell the whole truth.\"The tongji's face was already glued to the ground. His voice was as soft as a mosquito's buzz: \"We already said everything\u2026\u2026\"Shang Que: \"Un?\"The tongji immediately became so scared he started banging his head on the ground, nonstop. \"We'll say it now, right now\u2026\u2026\"Seeing this, Yu Zhengdu waved his fist around. \"Do it lightly, that's the tongji's face. If he becomes disfigured I'm going to beat you guys up!\"Old Mr. Yu couldn't help glancing at Yu Zhengdu in his peripheral vision. His hands trembled\u2026\u2026this was probably the only member of the Yu Clan who could threaten to beat the Three G.o.ds up without regard.The Three G.o.ds obviously didn't dare to hurt the tongji's body again. They held their head and said, \"Since falling into demonish ways, us three brothers just, just started becoming more selfish. We gave the luck that was supposed to be equally split among all our wors.h.i.+ppers to\u2026\u2026to our direct blood descent\u2026\u2026\"As soon as they finished speaking, the crowd went into an uproar. All the villagers of the Yu Clan stared at each other.Old Mr. Yu was shocked too. The Three G.o.ds were still the ancestors of the Yu Clan. Though they became greedy and tried to take over others' wors.h.i.+ppers and land, these behaviors really didn't have much effect on the Yu Clan. From a pathos point of view, the clansmen really didn't want to make things too difficult for them.But n.o.body expected that they took all of the Yu Clan's luck and gave it to their direct blood descendants. This was truly harming the entire clan.The Three G.o.ds also realized what they did was completely unacceptable, so though the tongji didn't dare to put his face on the ground again, he also didn't dare to lift it and make eye contact with the crowd. They stammered out, \"The Yu Clan has continued on for hundreds of years. There are many side branches and instances of intermarriage, so the blood here has been impure for a while. Though everyone has the same surname, most are not of the same direct clan as us three brothers\u2026\u2026\"He hadn't finished speaking yet, but everyone basically already understood.These Three G.o.ds were technically only the Three G.o.ds for the direct bloodline of their Yu Clan. Ever since falling into demonish ways, they were overtaken by greed, so naturally only protected their direct blood descendants. As for the other wors.h.i.+ppers, they were simply pa.s.sersby who could be preyed upon.\"You, you\u2026\u2026\" Old Mr. Yu shook as he looked at the tongji. He wanted to say something, but couldn't.The Yu Clan's clansmen around him were the same way. Their hearts felt cold thinking about how the Three G.o.ds they so faithfully wors.h.i.+pped had taken the luck that originally belonged to them and given it to their direct blood descendants.Someone in the crowd took the initiative to yell, \"Who is their direct blood descendant? Who took all of our luck?\"With his start, others started to ask too, \"Yes, tell us, who is it?\"The surroundings were loud with agitation and anger. The scene was about to lose control, but thankfully Daoist priest Kou stepped up to solve the issue. \"Everyone, there's no need to be so outraged. Taking others' luck is something that will not be tolerated by the Heavens. It was fine before with the Three G.o.ds' protection, but now that the Three G.o.ds have fallen and will lose their following in the mortal realm, they can't even protect themselves. Their descendant won't be able to hold onto all this luck. It will be returned to everyone eventually.\"The crowd only calmed down after he said this.\"Yi?\" Yu Zhengdu clapped. \"Isn't this just the law of conservation of luck? Science hasn't failed me!\"Shang Que: \"\u2026\u2026\" Why is he still so good at summarizing?!Only to see Daoist priest Kou look as if he had been struck with an epiphany. His voice was filled with praise, \"Little householder Yu is absolutely right. How come I never thought of it this way? As expected, using science to guide the way of cultivation makes for the fastest results.\"Shang Que: \"\u2026\u2026\"Someone can understand the truth from Yu Zhengdu's summaries?At this point, Old Mr. Yu had nothing else to say either. He could only inquire Shang Que and them, \"Can you please advise us what we should do to resolve the Three G.o.ds' situation.\"As he was speaking, the tongji trembled, then fell on the ground. The Three G.o.ds had left his body.Of course, what Yu Zhengdu saw was the Three G.o.ds obediently crawling out of the tongji's body to face the public ancestral temple and squat with their hands over their heads.Their postures were quite accurate.Yu Zhengdu sweat for a moment, then pretended nothing had happened and told Elder Yu, \"Actually we have already texted the Three G.o.ds' supervisors. They just sent someone to take them away.\"Daoist priest Kou: \"\u2026\u2026???\"Old Mr. Yu: \"\u2026\u2026Ah?\"Old Mr. Yu clearly couldn't accept such advanced technology so suddenly, so reflexively turned to look at Daoist priest Kou, who most fulfilled the traditional standard of a religious master. \"Daoist priest Kou, is this, is this considered resolved?\"Although Daoist priest Kou also felt like he had just suffered a heart attack, he still held out and nodded. \"Since these two householders could so easily borrow thunder fire, I'm sure that they have a really good relations.h.i.+p with the\u2026\u2026the supervisor. It should be fine listening to them.\"Only then did Old Mr. Yu nod. \"That's good, that's good.\"After solving the issue with the Three G.o.ds, Yu Zhengdu spoke up again, \"Oh right, Old Mr. Yu, the Three G.o.ds previously bullied the other local G.o.ds and caused them to leave. Now that the three of them have been arrested, a religious ceremony still needs to be performed to invite the local G.o.ds back.\"Old Mr. Yu hurriedly nodded. \"Of course of course.\"As for the true G.o.d that Yu Zhengdu wanted them to invite back, well, it was the old man he and Shang Que had seen in the alley of the old village area of Jintan.Fu De True G.o.d, or better known in the mortal realm as the Village G.o.d.Before the heavens and earth collapsed, the Village G.o.d was nothing but a small G.o.d in the mortal realm. He was only in charge of the land around a village or county, so didn't receive a lot of incense offerings. However, he was still an actual G.o.d, so got along fine with the Three G.o.ds.After the heavens and earth collapsed, because the Village G.o.ds were stationed in the mortal realm, they luckily managed to escape certain death. But the Village G.o.d of the Yu Clan was unlucky, because the Three G.o.ds received more incense offerings than him, so he, as a true but small G.o.d, got bullied.The Village G.o.d was a local small G.o.d. After being kicked off his pedestal, he had nowhere else to go, so stayed and wandered Jintan Village for many years. Thankfully, he finally met Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que.Though he was in bad shape, the Village G.o.d was, ultimately, an actual and true G.o.d, part of the G.o.dly ranks. Because of this, upon discussion, the Yu Clan decided to renovate what had originally been the Three G.o.ds Temple to become the Fu De True G.o.d Temple.The ceremony of inviting G.o.ds wasn't in Luofeng's scope of business, and it was even more impossible to get Shang Que to host such a ceremony. According to him, it was the G.o.ds that should invite him instead. Thus, this ceremony was completed by Daoist priest Kou.As for the true G.o.d who was invited back, in order to prevent another situation where uncontrolled G.o.ds like the Three G.o.ds did what they wanted, he was temporarily managed by Luofeng.Yu Zhengdu looked at the Village G.o.d who was begging Shang Que for an employee number from Luofeng: \u2026\u2026My new coworker?????That night, after completing the ceremony, Daoist priest Kou logged into his Weibo:Danyang Temple's Daoist Priest Kou Buzhi: After discussing with two householders from Luofeng Life Management today, I have learned quite a lot. I have specially found some high school physics and Marxist philosophy textbooks to read. From now on, I will seek to guide my cultivation path through the use of advanced technology, and thus have decided to share these findings with you all.Netizens: ??????????The next day, in Yu Zhengdu's home.\"Did you call me over for something?\" Yu Manjiang asked while looking at the crowd of people in front of him. The expression on his face wasn't too happy.Last night, Yu Zhengdu's dad had called to ask him to come over today. Yu Manjiang had never liked Father Yu and his family, especially shunning how poor they were. He hadn't been to their house in years, but the prowess Yu Zhengdu and the company he worked at had shown in the Three G.o.ds situation caused him to be slightly frightened. He carefully pondered his options and reluctantly decided to agree.He didn't expect to also see Old Mr. Yu and Daoist priest Kou there when he arrived.Yu Manjiang had a slight suspicion in his heart, but pretended he didn't know anything and acted normal.Father Yu waved his hands. \"Sit and speak.\"They sat down around the tea table. Mother Yu brought out some freshly brewed tea and smiled, \"Have some tea first.\"Yu Manjiang picked up the tea cup and immediately started laughing. He looked at Father Yu in disapproval, \"Yu Chuan, what, after seeing the rabbit fur glaze at my house you decided to go buy a set too?\"The tea set Mother Yu had brought out was the Golden Rabbit Fur Shang Que had gifted them. This was because Father Yu considered the fact that both Old Mr. Yu and Yu Manjiang were a bit more specific about their tea sets, so he specifically chose this one. Otherwise, in accordance to how their family normally did things, it was more likely that each person would get a gla.s.s cup.Yu Manjiang turned the cup in his hand in a circle, saying, \"Why didn't you buy a better set. Look at how old this one is, hopefully it isn't backlogged stock.\"After this, he put the tea cup back down and didn't drink from it anymore. It was very clear that he spurned it greatly.Upon hearing this, Old Mr. Yu looked down at the tea cup too. He said, \"Actually, I think this Golden Rabbit Fur has a very antique and simple feel. True great artwork doesn't need so much intricacy.\"Yu Manjiang snorted. \"Please, it's not like you don't know what Yu Chuan's family situation is like. Can he afford a good tea set?\"Father Yu's face was dark. He glanced at Shang Que who was playing with his phone off to the side. \"This is a gift from Zhengdu's coworker, Xiao Shang. He's very knowledgeable about, what was it, the Song Dynasty's tea fights. He has excellent taste.\"Shang Que maintained his posture playing his mobile game, completely ignoring them all.Since becoming rich, Yu Manjiang had been surrounded by people who sought to please and flatter him. When had he ever met someone who clearly didn't think he was worth anything? Thus, he was a bit unhappy and purposefully asked Shang Que, \"Oh, may I ask where Mr. Shang bought this black glazed tea set? To be a bit impolite, I know a little about every famous craftsman in the nation. Maybe I can help give you a second opinion.\"\"I randomly grabbed it.\" Shang Que finally lifted his gaze. His tone was impatient. \"Why do you have so many useless things to say?\"Yu Manjiang: \"\u2026\u2026\"How is this person so rude!But ruder behavior followed after. After speaking, Shang Que directly ignored him and turned to scoot closer to Yu Zhengdu. He held his phone out. \"Help me open the treasure chest.\"Yu Zhengdu side-eyed him. \"Can't you open it yourself?\"Shang Que replied very straightforwardly, \"My face is dark.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\"He mouthed the words \"African ghost!\" secretly at his Boss in mockery.But teasing was just teasing, he still grabbed the phone, and was just about to open the treasure chest when he suddenly narrowed his eyes. \"Don't you have to pay to open this? Where did you get the money from?\"Shang Que, very proudly: \"I saved it.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026Fine.\"Yu Manjiang: \"\u2026\u2026\" So he's a broke a.s.s. If he's so broke why does he have such a bad temper!It could be said that Father Yu was quite kind. He didn't leave Yu Manjiang in such an awkward situation, hurriedly switching the topic. \"Um, how about we discuss some official business.\"Old Mr. Yu nodded, then looked toward Yu Manjiang. He stated, \"Manjiang, yesterday we checked the Yu Clan's family tree\u2026\u2026\"Before he finished talking, Yu Manjiang acted like an animal that had just had its tail stepped on. He almost reflexively asked, \"Why would you randomly check the family tree?\"Old Mr. Yu's expression was solemn. \"Manjiang, yesterday I didn't want to embarra.s.s you in front of everyone, but I think you can probably guess. You are the direct blood descendant of the Three G.o.ds.\"They actually didn't need to check the family tree. As long as they put some thought into who was the only person in the Yu Clan that had been luckiest since the Three G.o.ds fell into demonish ways, the answer was quite obvious.Checking the family tree was only a way of making sure.If Old Mr. Yu could think of it, Yu Manjiang could too, but he refused to admit that his good luck was stolen from anyone else. He immediately denied it, \"Elder Yu, maybe I am the Three G.o.ds' direct blood descendant, but what of it?\"Off to the side, Daoist priest Kou added on, \"Mr. Manjiang, your luck in the past few years wasn't your own. We've invited you over this time to try and ask you to do more charity work. It'd be best if you could donate all the money that doesn't belong to you to those villagers whose luck you took.\"\"What a load of bulls.h.i.+t.\" Yu Manjiang's expression changed. \"All that I've earned in these past few years are the result of my hard labor. You want to erase all that I've worked for with only a single phrase\u2026\u2026\"He laughed coldly, \"I suppose that the real point is to get me to donate money, but what if I refuse?\"Yu Manjiang wasn't in need of money, but he knew that as soon as he donated a sum of money, he would be indirectly admitting he had stolen other people's luck. His social status would immediately fall, so no matter what, he couldn't agree.Old Mr. Yu said, \"Manjiang, this is for your own good.\"Daoist priest Kou nodded his head in agreement. \"Now that the Three G.o.ds have been arrested, they can no longer protect you. You can't maintain all that luck yourself; it defies the laws of the Heavens. If you continue to cheat destiny, you will experience an exponential rebound, so please rethink this\u2026\u2026\"\"That's enough.\" Yu Manjiang was so mad his face was red. His mouth felt dry, so he picked up the tea cup to take a sip. His voice was mocking, \"Am I cheating destiny just because you say I'm cheating destiny? Who has evidence? Those two?\"He looked at Shang Que, only to see that the other was still playing on his phone!Yu Manjiang: !!!! He's really so impolite!This time it was Father Yu who became angry. He immediately contradicted, \"Yu Manjiang, what do you mean? Do you want to slander Zhengdu and say he's a scammer again?\"\"That's exactly what I mean!\" Yu Manjiang's blood was boiling at Shang Que's att.i.tude. \"I think your family is so broke you've all gone crazy, trying to get money from me using all sorts of methods. I refuse to let you guys have your way.\"After finis.h.i.+ng speaking, he threw the tea cup in his hand on the ground, hard. \"You're just jealous of how good my life is. Copying me and using rabbit fur glaze, with your broke-a.s.s ways, you can only afford to use these cheap things.\"The tea cup fell on the ground with a \"keng\u2014\u2014\", breaking into several pieces.This time, Shang Que finally lifted his head to look at the broken ceramic bits on the ground. His face was expressionless.Father Yu finally couldn't stand it anymore. He shouted, \"Yu Manjiang, say what you will, but how dare you break our family's stuff!\"Yu Zhengdu was quite p.i.s.sed off too. He puffed out his cheeks to look at Shang Que, \"Boss, eat him!\"Yu Manjiang scoffed disdainfully at Father Yu. \"If it's broken, it's broken. I'll just buy you another set to make up for it. Oh wait, I'm not as poor as you. I'll compensate you with ten more sets.\"Father Yu was so mad he almost became a puffer fish. He wanted to directly slap Yu Manjiang, but was stopped by his words. He couldn't do anything else, because the tea set truly looked like old, backlogged stock. It probably really wasn't worth much.But it wasn't about money, it was about the fact that the tea cup was a gift from Shang Que. How could he not be angry seeing Yu Manjiang break it right in front of him!Yu Manjiang finally felt pleased after seeing Father Yu try to hold back his anger. He purposefully provoked Shang Que, \"Xiao Shang, was it. Where did you buy this? I'll get someone to bring you ten sets next time.\"Shang Que exited his game and lightly said, \"You can't buy it anymore.\"\"What? It's out of stock?\" Yu Manjiang was unbothered. \"Fine, I'll give you cash. Name your price and I'll pay you 10 times that.\"Father Yu was so mad he started furiously rolling his eyes. He very proudly stated, \"We don't need your stinkin' money!\"At the same time, Shang Que also said, \"Okay, let me look up the price.\"Father Yu: \"\u2026\u2026\"He looked at Shang Que in complaint. At a critical time like this just forget the little money ah, your image is the most important.Yu Zhengdu used a small voice to ask, \"Boss, we don't need that bit of money right?\"Shang Que pondered a bit, \"Actually we do\u2026\u2026\"Yu Manjiang laughed loudly. \"How much do you need. Tell me, don't bother being polite. I can afford a couple thousand.\"Shang Que lifted his head. \"One is a little more than 4,300,000 RMB. I'll make it whole, so just 4,300,000 RMB. Ten times of that would be 43,000,000 RMB.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"Pu\u2014\u2014\"Everyone else: \"!!!!\" The youth aren't so simple, raising the price on the spot so naturally and confidently.Yu Manjiang immediately stomped his foot. \"Are you so broke you've gone crazy. Even if you're scamming you need to get the basics right. What kind of tea cup is over 4 million RMB, are you trying to tell me that was an antique?\"Shang Que crossed his legs elegantly. \"It was from the Song Dynasty.\"He thought about it, then added, \"I think it was made when Zhao Shen was on the throne.\"As someone who barely pa.s.sed his culture cla.s.ses, Father Yu didn't know who Zhao Shen was. So he very sincerely asked, \"Who is Zhao Shen?\"It was Old Mr. Yu who was more knowledgeable. He suddenly recalled, \"That's the name of Emperor Xiaozong of the Southern Song Dynasty.\"Yu Manjiang was so mad he started laughing. \"It's from the Song Dynasty because you said it's from the Song Dynasty? And Zhao someone Shen, who can't randomly say a name? Young man, this isn't how you scam. If you were smart, I could have directly given you a couple thousand, but if you're going to exaggerate the price so much, be careful of not even earning a cent back.\"Shang Que had better things to do than argue with him, so directly said, \"You can take it to go get an appraisal.\"Yu Manjiang froze. \"What did you say?\"He didn't think that a scammer would bring up appraisals. What kind of move was this?At this time, Old Mr. Yu tsk'd in awe from the side. \"No wonder why I thought this black glaze just now was unique in both appearance and texture. The quality of the porcelain is dense and strong while the body is thick. Though it looks a bit old, the color of the glaze is still transparent, as gentle and smooth as the best jades. This must be a work from the Jian kilns, right?\"Elder Yu's words caused Yu Manjiang's heart to momentarily skip a beat.Old Mr. Yu held such a high position in the Yu Clan not only became he had good morals and was virtuous, but also because he was extremely educated. He was a cultural expert, but was also an avid student in the ways of tea, antiques, and other elegant hobbies. Disregarding everything else, many years ago Old Mr. Yu often helped others appraise their antiques; he was very rarely wrong.It couldn't be, that stupid tea cup was really an antique?Yu Manjiang panicked, but also felt that it was impossible. He desperately said, \"Elder Yu, you think too highly of Yu Chuan. Could his family possibly own antiques? And they use it to drink tea; I've commonly come in contact with the true higher cla.s.ses and never seen them use antiques so irresponsibly\u2026\u2026\"But Old Mr. Yu ignored him and walked over to the window with the tea cup. He observed it in detail under the sunlight, speaking to himself, \"That's right, that's right. This is the cla.s.sic glaze color of the Jian kilns, black with hints of cyan, s.h.i.+ny and smooth, deep and heavy in hue. There are even crystallized structures\u2026\u2026\"\"Is there a magnifying gla.s.s?\" Old Mr. Yu turned his head in excitement to ask. Then he thought about it and changed his mind, \"Yu Chuan, hurry and make a call to my home. Tell them to bring my appraisal equipment over.\"Father Yu was completely lost and in even more disbelief than Yu Manjiang. \"Elder Yu, did you get it wrong? This is really an antique?\"\"Most likely, and a very rare piece of pottery originating from the Song kilns.\" Old Mr. Yu's voice was trembling. He didn't dare to move while holding the black glazed tea cup. \"Look at how the form of the cup is st.u.r.dy, how it's thinner around the mouth, and how smoothly and naturally the glaze drips down. This is a very cla.s.sic defining point of the ancient Jian kilns' black glazed pottery. And here on the bottom of the outside, you can see some unpainted porcelain. It irregularly peeks through\u2026\u2026\"Old Mr. Yu simultaneously spoke and kept a.n.a.lyzing. With each sentence he said, Yu Manjiang's heart sank a bit lower in his chest. Though he was very displeased with Old Mr. Yu this time, he also knew that Elder Yu wasn't the type to make things up on the spot.Especially because\u2026\u2026Elder Yu's words seemed very sincere. Even if it was a scam, the scam couldn't be so well-rounded.Old Mr. Yu was already engrossed in examining the tea cup. He was both in a rush and angry, \"Yu Chuan, hurry and call my family to bring my equipment over. There are very few Jian kiln black glazed ceramics left, especially ones as well preserved as this Golden Rabbit Fur. If it's appraised, there's no way the value would be under 4 million RMB!\"Shang Que didn't care what Old Mr. Yu said, only adding, \"Get it appraised. Our company places an emphasis on our honesty. Neither the young nor the old will be cheated.\"Yu Zhengdu: = =He spent some time recovering, then finally realized something. He looked at Shang Que in shock. \"Boss, you really gifted us antiques?\"Shang Que looked at him. \"Yeah.\"Yu Zhengdu thought he was going to stop breathing. \"Since you already own antiques, why are you still pretending to be broke?\"Shang Que furrowed his brows. \"I'm not pretending. I don't have any renminbi.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu's heart hurt so much he could barely breathe. \"Why didn't you say anything earlier. An antique, worth over 4 million, broken just like that\u2026\u2026\"Shang Que was silent for a moment, then told him carelessly, \"Antiques are precious because they're scarce. The less there are, the more valuable they become.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026?\"Shang Que lightly laughed. \"In the past, those who collected antiques would purposefully destroy the ones that looked the same, so the remaining would be one of a kind.\"He c.o.c.ked an eyebrow. \"But this doesn't affect us asking him for compensation.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\" You could say that\u2026\u2026Shang Que saw that he looked like his heart still hurt, so continued, \"If you toss two more of the black glazed tea cups from the set on the ground, the remaining one will become priceless. It might even be more valuable than all four combined.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"!!!!!!\"He silently looked at the table where Daoist priest Kou was currently holding onto the tea cup, trying to experience the feeling of drinking tea from an antique.At the same time, Father Yu urgently charged over and s.n.a.t.c.hed the cup from Daoist priest Kou's hands. \"Don't move!\"He held the tea cup delicately in both hands, then carefully placed it on the table. His voice was filled with gentle love, \"This is an antique ah!\"Yu Zhengdu turned his head away speechlessly. \"\u2026\u2026There's no chance. My dad will definitely start wors.h.i.+pping these cups. Not to mention tossing them on the ground, I doubt we'll even be able to touch them.\"On the other side, Daoist priest Kou exhaled deeply. \"It seems like Mr. Manjiang's luck has started rebounding.\"Yu Manjiang: \"\u2026\u2026!!!\"The author has something to say:Zhengdu: So, does Boss really have money or not?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAt first Yu Manjiang was adamant that Shang Que was scamming him, but when Old Mr. Yu's family members brought him his appraisal equipment and everyone gathered around the broken pieces of ceramic to examine them and sigh, he finally started really panicking.Finally, to accurately determine the value of this set of black glaze ceramics, Old Mr. Yu advised them to send it to a respected accreditation office for appraisal.n.o.body expected for the accreditation office to send back a response with a price a lot higher than the one Shang Que had initially said. Because there were very few Rabbit Fur Black Glaze tea sets made in ancient Jian kilns remaining, and because the one Shang Que had gifted to Yu Zhengdu's family was exceptionally well maintained, the final value determined by the office was over 60 thousand per cup.When Yu Manjiang received this news he almost pa.s.sed out. After all, he had bluffed to Shang Que that he would compensate them ten times the price.But this really wasn't him pretending to be rich. At the time, he couldn't possibly have known that this young man was even better at acting than him; he owned antiques from the Song Dynasty, but still complained about having to save money to buy the treasure chests in his mobile game?How could he have known that this person was so hardcore, daring to let Yu Zhengdu's family use antiques as normal tea cups?This was definitely a legendary level of truly breaking ceramics, in all senses.At first Yu Manjiang wanted to go back on his words, because after all, antiques were priceless and the office had only given them an approximate price, not the actual market price.But he didn't manage to persevere for long, because starting on the first night that he decided to go back on his words, he started having endless nightmares. In these nightmares, he was hara.s.sed by evil ghosts; each ghost would stare at him with their b.l.o.o.d.y face, a poster similar to those migrant workers used to demand unpaid salaries in their hands: Pay off your debt.When he was awake he would also continuously have visual and auditory hallucinations constantly yelling in his ear, \"Pay up\u2026\u2026pay up\u2026\u2026pay up\u2026\u2026\" It was really terrifying!Yu Manjiang belatedly realized that Yu Zhengdu's company had the technology to communicate with the Underworld. He reasonably suspected that Yu Zhengdu and them had invited some ghosts from the Underworld to scare him\u2026\u2026After visiting many doctors and still being unable to determine any sign of illness, he finally surrendered and paid up. After all, no matter how unwilling he was to spend money, he had to be alive to spend it.At least Yu Zhengdu's family wasn't the type to loot a burning house. They didn't actually make him pay ten times the compensation, only the value that the accreditation office had given.Actually, considering how much Yu Manjiang owned, paying over one million in compensation was nothing. But for him, this was only the beginning. After this incident, he finally experienced the hards.h.i.+ps of life.First, his business was met with several difficulties. The projects currently in motion encountered trouble one by one; his wealth started rus.h.i.+ng away like floodwater. And in the eyes of the Yu Clan's clansmen, his social status. .h.i.t rock bottom in an instant. After all, they weren't idiots. Though it had never been confirmed outright, they quite easily figured out who the person that had stolen all the Yu Clan's luck was.Yu Manjiang's life had gone smoothly for 20 years, but now he had finally used up all his luck. Seemingly overnight, his life changed drastically.But the events with Yu Manjiang all came later. Right now, Yu Zhengdu's family had plenty of other things to stress about.After learning that the Rabbit Fur Black Glaze tea cups were actual antiques from the Song Dynasty, Father Yu didn't dare to keep them anymore, wanting to return them to Shang Que at all costs. But Shang Que's method of showing courtesy was slightly different. He didn't care what Father Yu said at all and only sat there ignoring him, playing his mobile games.After Father Yu tired himself out, he finally nonchalantly said, \"If you guys don't want them, then you can just toss them on the ground and break them.\"Father Yu: \"\u2026\u2026\"Why is this person so overbearing about giving presents!Yu Zhengdu originally thought accepting such an expensive gift wasn't right either, but now he kind of had an idea of what Shang Que's temper was like. He knew that if the man said it, he would definitely be able to do it. Thus, he immediately charged over to protect the tea cups, \"I want them!\"Shang Que was finally slightly satisfied at this. He raised his chin, pleased, and bravely said, \"\u2026\u2026Then I want to buy two more treasure chests!\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\" Boss who owns antiques is still so frugal that it hurts.Actually the compensation from Yu Manjiang had been directly deposited in Luofeng's company funds, yet compared to the amount needed to keep a business running long term, it was clearly not enough.But the most tragic was still Father Yu. As a middle-aged man who had nothing to do with elegant, he knew nothing about antiques. After suddenly receiving a priceless set of Song ceramics, he was so anxious he had insomnia for several nights.In the end, it was Mother Yu who persuaded him to act normally about it. This, along with the pep talks he gave himself, finally allowed him to recover.In the time after that, though, the number of guests who visited their house obviously increased. Among them, many were authoritative figures who rarely kept in contact with their family in the past. Without a doubt, they were there for the Golden Rabbit Fur tea set. Because of this tea set, Father Yu's status rapidly rose not only in the Yu Clan, but also in all of Jintan Village.Shang Que didn't care about the reactions the Rabbit Fur Black Glaze tea set caused in Jintan Village. Yu Zhengdu didn't bother with this either. For them, the most important thing at the moment was something else entirely.As they were resolving the issue with Yu Manjiang, a non-stop flow of villagers contacted them through Father Yu. They wanted to pay to contact their relatives in the Underworld. It turned out, in the past few days, the incident in front of the Yu Clan's public ancestral temple had been spread throughout the entirety of Jintan Village.The Three G.o.ds' demise caused people to sigh, but for those outside of the Yu Clan, it was at most a piece of gossip to be shared during tea time. What really caught everyone's attention afterwards was the YinYang Communications Technology developed by Yu Zhengdu and his company.When it had first been talked about, those who weren't at the scene thought it was only tomfoolery, and many mocked those sharing the story. But quite soon after, more and more people present that day stepped up as witnesses. When Old Mr. Yu and Daoist priest Kou also said they could provide evidence, everyone finally realized, the story was actually real.Not only this, but according to the rumors, the situation with the Three G.o.ds of the Yu Clan had also been resolved by them.In one night, all the residents of Jintan Village became surrounded by question marks. Things can be done like that???????With Old Mr. Yu and Daoist priest Kou's confirmation, Luofeng's technology immediately became famous in Jintan Village. Though many still thought it was just a scam, there were also others on the fence about it. They came to Yu Zhengdu's house with the mentality of simply trying it for fun. Many of these people had money and authority, so the amounts they offered were quite large.Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que had a discussion and decided that they could develop a service in this area. Allowing communication to the Underworld was technically the same as the tongji performing divination. Their technology just allowed the messages to send faster and more accurately is all.To make a not completely accurate comparison, divination conducted by tongjis was similar to the communications of the past. You had to work to handwrite a letter and ask someone to deliver it. The journey was difficult and dangerous, so the letter might not even make it to its final destination. If it did arrive, you might not receive a response. And if you did, there was no guarantee that the message wasn't somehow changed along the way.But Luofeng's YinYang Communications Technology was the equivalent of modern messaging, and it had directly skipped over telegrams and telephones to make its way straight into the age of the Internet. It could be considered a great technological advancement.But when the tongji performed divination, there were taboos. Similarly, the YinYang Communications would have taboos too. The amount of times a human could contact someone in the Underworld needed to be closely monitored, as well as the content of their conversations. Topics bringing up the secrets between the two worlds or the balance between the two worlds had to be strictly forbidden.Because there were a lot of things to be aware of, Yu Zhengdu wasn't in a hurry to agree. He only had Father Yu give everyone a customer support phone number; they would only release this service after they got back to the company and created complete product service content for it.By the time everything was resolved, their Qingming mini vacation was over too. Thus, Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que made their way back to Fu City.Before leaving, Father Yu held onto Yu Zhengdu's hand and wouldn't let go. \"Zhengdu ah, how about, you just don't accept Xiao Shang's pay.\"Father and Mother Yu already knew now that Shang Que wasn't a normal coworker, but Yu Zhengdu's boss.Yu Zhengdu felt very wronged. \"\u2026\u2026Dad, I need to eat.\" It's not like he could eat the black glaze tea set!Father Yu thought about it. \"How about, you eat less?\"Mother Yu slapped him on the head. \"Is that how you should act as a dad?\"Shang Que had both his hands in his pockets. He lifted his chin and said, \"I won't let him go hungry.\"Because they were about to start a new project, as soon as Yu Zhengdu returned to Fu City, he was full of motivation. Of course, a large reason was also because of the Rabbit Fur Black Glaze tea set. This was the supposed taking from someone who didn't have much. In the past, when he thought of their company's lack of finances, he could still pull through by thinking about how he was only working there one year anyways. But after coming back this time, he subconsciously started considering the eventual future of their company.He couldn't help but be suspicious that this was all part of Boss's conspiracy!That night in his dorm room, Yu Zhengdu looked through some product designs and business plans, then asked Shang Que for the proper etiquette and taboos of communicating between the Underworld and mortal realms. He wanted to prepare a plan ahead of time.Shang Que had no written materials on the topic, so could only verbally tell him. Thus, Yu Zhengdu was simultaneously on his computer organizing the plan and talking to his boss through voice messages. His three roommates were quite speechless.Finally, Zhu Yan couldn't help it anymore and sneakily asked, \"Who are you sending voice messages to?\"Yu Zhengdu remained staring at his computer, casually answering, \"My boss.\"Zhu Yan was shocked. \"Is your boss a person? We're still on break but he's already making you work again?\"\"Un, he really isn't a person,\" Yu Zhengdu said.Zhu Yan cussed. \"You should invite those types of bosses over for Qingming.\"Yu Zhengdu smiled mysteriously, \"I already did.\"Zhu Yan didn't get the message behind his words, so asked him very anxiously, \"Zhengdu, you haven't been looking for work these days. You're not really planning on staying at this company forever, right?\"Yu Zhengdu was in a tough spot but couldn't say anything about it, so could only hold back tears and nod. \"I am.\"\"But, you have such great skills, you don't need to\u2026\u2026\" Zhu Yan thought his heart was going to break from over-worrying. He added, \"Oh right, isn't our graduation ceremony next month? I heard that Jiao Shanlan will come too, and will give a speech as outstanding alumni\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu thought about it and nodded. \"Oh, right. He's about to come back to the country.\"Zhu Yan paused for a moment. \"How come you know more than me?\"At this time, Yu Zhengdu's boss sent an unknown message over. Yu Zhengdu yelled into his WeChat: \"Not possible! You really aren't a human, a normal human wouldn't think like that\u2026\u2026\"Zhu Yan: \"\u2026\u2026\"\"f.u.c.k, what a brave man!\" Zhu Yan looked at him in admiration as he gave him a thumbs up. \"You dared to tell your boss exactly what you thought?!\"Their other two roommates also couldn't help but turn their heads over and compliment his courage. \"Good job!\"Yu Zhengdu coughed lightly, vaguely saying, \"Uh, I was just telling the truth\u2026\u2026\"\"As expected, you can do what you want when you have the skills.\" Zhu Yan was truly envious and lamented for a bit before finally dragging the topic of conversation back. \"Oh right, continuing with Jiao Shanlan. Isn't he one of the important techies at Nova? I still think your Nova offer falling through was suspicious; I bet that during the graduation ceremony you're going to give a speech as student representative. How about taking the opportunity to ask Jiao Shanlan, maybe he'll know what happened?\"The more he spoke, the more Zhu Yan thought this was a good idea, but Yu Zhengdu seemed uninterested. He was still completely focused on his computer. \"Let's talk about this later.\"\"Can you care a little more about your career!\" Zhu Yan scratched his head, then leapt over to hang onto his back. He was just about to shake Yu Zhengdu's head.At this moment, Yu Zhengdu's WeChat buzzed and another notification showed up.Wei Xiao:\u3010Student Xiao Yu, can I ask if you're going to be at the office tomorrow? If it's convenient, I hope to make a personal visit. Mr. Shang Que told me to discuss with you.\u3011Zhu Yan: ??????????Zhu Yan blinked. He looked at the WeChat page and then at Yu Zhengdu. \"Wei Xiao? Which Wei Xiao? Wei Xiao from Ox Factory?\"Yu Zhengdu picked up his phone to reply. He nodded, \"That's him.\"Yu Zhengdu:\u3010I'll be there tomorrow. What does Boss Wei need?\u3011Zhu Yan was shocked. \"\u2026\u2026The people you come in contact with now are already so high cla.s.s?\"As soon as he finished, Wei Xiao's message popped up again.Wei Xiao:\u3010It's still about the product.\u3011Wei Xiao:\u3010Other than myself, I have two other friends, the CEOs of Wind Riders Technology and Excellent Jade Corporation, who also wish to visit. Please agree to see us.\u3011Zhu Yan: \"\u2026\u2026\"Wind Riders Technology and Excellent Jade Corporation. These two companies were the dream businesses of every up and coming graduate. If you could get hired as an intern, that was enough to brag to your cla.s.smates about for a long time.Zhu Yan held out his fists in a salute. \"I think your job now is fine. You don't need to switch.\"The author has something to say:Zhu Yan: An impressive social circle, and can directly tell the boss he isn't a human. I'm jealous.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe next day, as soon as Yu Zhengdu arrived at work, he felt that the entire office was covered in a gloomy atmosphere. All his ghost coworkers seemed stressed and depressed, a complete 180 from how happy they were before the holiday.Kang Jin had even put his wig on crooked.All of Yu Zhengdu's motivation disappeared upon seeing them. He asked, \"No way, is your post-holiday depression so serious?\"Even though going to work makes one feel the same way as going to visit a grave, didn't you guys just come back from visiting your graves\u2026\u2026As soon as Kang Jin saw him, he immediately wuwa'd and clung onto him. \"Xiao Yu, the quality of our lives in the future is entirely dependant on you.\"Yu Zhengdu reached a hand out to catch his wig that had fallen off and looked at his oily and s.h.i.+ny bald head. He felt that his eyes had just suffered a tremendous injury, so hurriedly put the wig back on and chaffed, \"Say what you will, don't use your hands and feet.Kang Jin pitifully put his wig back on and said, \"These past couple of years the country has been strongly advocating for civilized paying of respects and have banned burning things outside. The amount of offerings we received this year decreased greatly from last year. And a lot of people have been influenced by American dramas too, so they've started paying their respects with fresh flowers instead. My family brought me two bouquets of chrysanthemums, but not even a single new set of clothes\u2026\u2026\"The more he spoke, the more depressed he got. \"I won't be the most fas.h.i.+onable man in the Underworld anymore\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu couldn't hold himself back and said, \"You never were\u2026\u2026\"Kang Jin: \"\u2026\u2026\"His mouth twitched; two teardrops were about to fall, but didn't. \"In the past I won first place for the Underworld's Mr. Fas.h.i.+onable compet.i.tion every year\u2026\u2026\"After he spoke, Yu Zhengdu's eyes widened. He didn't know to be shocked that the Underworld had that type of compet.i.tion first, or shocked that Kang Jin could win the champion's t.i.tle first. Another coworker, Qu Lv, quickly solved the riddle for him. \"He left out a word. It's the 'Underworld's Old Mr. Fas.h.i.+onable' compet.i.tion. The contestants are all 70 to 80 year old grandpas, and the judges are all grandmas\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026Seems like life in the Underworld is pretty laid back.\"Qu Lv finished complaining about Kang Jin, but was also worried himself. \"What will we do, I still have ten years before reincarnation. At the rate things are going, life will get harder and harder in the next couple of years. We won't even have a change of clothes anymore.\"Hearing this, Yu Zhengdu was quite exasperated too. \"There's nothing we can do. Burning things outside is really very dangerous, so what they're advocating for is right. The laws will only get stricter from here on out.\"After saying this, everyone became more stressed.Yu Zhengdu thought about it, then said, \"How about after I get paid, I'll burn a new set of clothes for all of you.\"Kang Jin wanted to jump on Yu Zhengdu again. \"Having a living person in our company is really too awesome!\"Qu Lv sighed, \"We have Xiao Yu to help us, but all the other ghosts can only depend on their luck.\"They spoke for a bit, before Lu Lingxi notified Yu Zhengdu that Wei Xiao and his friends had arrived.The two people that came with Wei Xiao were the CEOs of Wind Riders Technology, which worked in the development of AI, and Excellent Jade Corporation, which was a company that dealt in general entertainment. Their names were Cui Jianlan and Yang Xin, respectively.These two were very close with Wei Xiao and knew exactly what the circ.u.mstances involving his daughter were like. Thus, when Wei Xiao brought up Luofeng's luck-changing stones to them, they were among the first to want to place an order.But this time, they had personally come to visit Luofeng for the Underworld Energy Detector.What had happened was, last time, Wei Xiao had bought the new Underworld energy detection service offered by Luofeng just to try it out. But the results exceeded his expectations.His 70 year old mother had suffered from senile foot chilliness for a while. As soon as Wei Xiao became successful, he hired an innumerous amount of famous doctors to treat his mother, but none of them could detect that anything was wrong. He never expected that after simply scanning with Luofeng's detector, they discovered that his mother didn't have senile foot chilliness at all; instead, her leg had been covered with Underworld energy. Subsequently, Luofeng performed an in-depth a.n.a.lysis and predicted the time that the Underworld energy had attached itself to her. His mother thought about it and realized that the time coincided with when she had been working the night s.h.i.+ft in her youth. After work, she always had to pa.s.s by a graveyard to get home.As soon as the time frames matched, Wei Xiao's family's trust in them immediately rose to 90%. Later, Luofeng gave them a method to remove old and stubborn Underworld energy residue. Now, after one treatment, the senile foot chilliness that had bothered Wei Xiao's mother for years had become much better.Cui Jianlan and Yang Xin had originally both bought the jade, but remained suspicious about the new Underworld Energy Detector. Thus, neither of them bought it at first.But not much later, they began to regret it. There was no other reason, except for the fact that after buying the jade, they realized this company had true prowess. As people who spent a majority of their lives in the business field, they had more or less offended others before. There were often people who plotted against them behind their backs. After several years, their mental states had deteriorated from always being so alert. Ever since they started carrying the jade around, though, the stuffy feeling that had bothered them for so long suddenly lessened.Upon hearing about the situation with Wei Xiao's mother, they truly began to regret their decisions and hurriedly asked Wei Xiao to be the middleman in their attempts to purchase this service. But Luofeng's workload had started becoming heavier, so none of the workers had time to visit them and perform the service anymore. Thus, the two could only request for Wei Xiao to lead the way so they could drop by and get an examination.Yu Zhengdu performed the Underworld energy detection very adeptly for Cui Jianlan and Yang Xin. The detection program they were using now was one that had been upgraded several times; the results were precise and professional. The a.n.a.lysis could even be presented in the form of a report.After seeing the results, Cui Jianlan and Yang Xin offered an abundance of praise. They couldn't help but be impressed.Especially Yang Xin. His results indicated that there was a hint of Underworld energy on him. Not from running into a ghost, but according to Luofeng's a.n.a.lysis, likely because he had recently been to a graveyard that no longer housed any ghosts. Though the ghosts had already left, there was still some residual energy left in the earth.Yang Xin thought of what he had done in the past few months, then immediately asked his secretary for some materials.Their corporation dealt in general entertainment, which included business in entertainment estates. Last year, they had just purchased a piece of land in Chuandong, and were preparing to build an amus.e.m.e.nt park on it. Yang Xin had previously spent a great deal of time there.After his secretary sent the materials over, he finally learned that the land had been a battleground during the Sino-j.a.panese War. A lot of people had died there, but because it was so far in the past, not many knew about it. He only found out after hiring a specialized investigations department.Yang Xin was thoroughly impressed. He and Cui Jianlan felt that they were in the company of otherworldly masters.Yang Xin was still worried, so asked again: \"Oh right, according to this, it seems that our land in Chuandong still has some Underworld energy. I don't know if your company could help us go and remove it.\"\"We don't offer that service.\" Shang Que lifted his gaze. \"Just get a Daoist monk to cast some spells for you.\"Upon hearing this, Yang Xin felt pity. \"Ey, I already asked a religious master to check the fengshui for that piece of land. But they really didn't pay as much attention to detail as you guys do. I trust you guys a bit more.\"Shang Que put his hands out. \"We really don't do that.\"Yang Xin paused, then suddenly said, \"How about this, it doesn't matter whether or not you guys offer this service. I just want to ask you to go to Chuandong to take a look. Our company will cover all transportation costs and pay you 200,000 RMB on top of that. Is that okay?\"This time, before Shang Que could speak, Yu Zhengdu did first. He declared, \"Okay.\"Shang Que slowly looked at Yu Zhengdu, then nodded. \"Then fine.\"After he finished speaking, he grabbed a printed barcode cutout that merchants used and held it up to Yang Xin and Cui Jianlan. \"Today's detection fee. Please pay it first.\"Yang Xin: \"\u2026\u2026\"Cui Jianlan: \"\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu was speechless. \"\u2026\u2026When did you make a fee collection barcode?\"Shang Que slightly smiled, \"I just got it two days ago!\"Now that the company was receiving a lot of income, it would be a lot faster and easier to use a fee collection barcode. It was truly very advanced.Yang Xin and Cui Jianlan silently took out their phones and scanned the payment code.To be honest, as such big bosses, they rarely had to personally pay for things anymore. Normally, they would pay through the company. In this moment, they finally felt that they were equivalent in rank with everyone else.After collecting their money, Shang Que immediately wanted to see the guests out. Only for Cui Jianlan to suddenly lean forward and seriously inquire, \"Mr. Shang, Student Xiao Yu, I want to add this Underworld energy detection to the health checkups of my company's employees. I don't know if you guys accept group orders?\"Yang Xin, Wei Xiao: \"\u2026\u2026???\"Yu Zhengdu was stunned too. \"Employee checkup? How many people are in your company?\"\"Of course, it's not for all the employees,\" Cui Jianlan said. This was mainly because Luofeng's Underworld energy detection service wasn't cheap. It was even more expensive than a general health checkup. Purchasing it for the whole company wasn't reasonable. \"Mainly just for some older employees and those above a certain position. There are around 300 to 400 people in our company who meet those conditions.\"Yang Xin and Wei Xiao thought about it and were convinced too. Old and high ranking employees were the backbones of each company. When things occasionally happened to them, the losses suffered had to be calculated in ten thousands. Though adding an Underworld energy detection checkup would cost a lot, it would be worth it in the long run. Thus, the two of them also spoke up, \"I want to do this for my employees too.\"\"Exactly exactly, I want to get this service for my company as well.\"That would be a large order; Yu Zhengdu was more eager than them.Shang Que wanted to earn money too, but also felt troubled. \"We don't have that many people\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu immediately cut him off. \"We can hire people!\"Shang Que looked over, only to see a bright fire burning in Yu Zhengdu's eyes. \"Boss, it's time for us to expand!\"But that wasn't all. Yu Zhengdu then turned to look at the other three people. \"These three bosses, our company will be releasing a new Underworld communications service soon. As long as you meet the conditions, you will have the opportunity to talk with your already deceased family and friends once more. We're still in the preorder phase, but since you're all old customers, you can be the first to test it out.\"All three CEOs: \"\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026?????\"Though they didn't really understand what service he was talking about, the three bosses were only bewildered for a moment before resolutely nodding. \"We'll buy it.\"Shang Que: \"\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu was truly a good employee who always had the company's best interests in mind!That day, all ghosts who hadn't reincarnated yet received a hiring message on their phones:\u3010Hiring: 1.

I don't want to become famous among the ghosts!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs soon as the message that Luofeng was hiring got sent out, an abundance of applications immediately arrived.There was no other reason except for the fact that payment would be completed with the currency of the mortal realm. This was extremely tantalizing for the people\u2026\u2026ke, for the ghosts.In these days where the government advocated more and more for the cultured paying of respects, all ghosts awaiting reincarnation received less and less sacrificial offerings. Food was one matter, but for ghosts like Kang Jin who were dedicated to fas.h.i.+on (?), they often couldn't even get a new set of clothes before reincarnation. It truly made them melancholic.But if they could earn money of the mortal realm themselves, along with Luofeng's sacrificial subst.i.tute service, they could be freed from surviving off luck and start living off their own hard labor.Especially because Lufoeng was the only business in the Underworld. As soon as you were hired, you would get an employee identification number from h.e.l.l itself. The abundance of benefits made it the definite dream job for every ghost.Overnight, HR manager Lu Lingxi received over 10,000 resumes. There were also several inquiry texts filled with wailing; the sheer number of them caused Luofeng's server to go down:\u3010Even though my face is a little green, I can still put on foundation! As long as you guys give me a chance, I can turn myself into a beauty guru!!!\u3011\u3010Uncle and auntie, do you need an elementary school student? I want to earn money to buy a game console?\u3011\u3010Do you guys have the five insurances and housing fund? Will I get priority reincarnation?\u3011\u3010You guys are prejudiced against ghosts. Even though I died somewhat tragically, I still have a beautiful heart. You guys shouldn't take away my opportunity to work!\u3011\u3010If the interviewer wants to enforce some unspoken rules: I'm okay with that!!!\u3011Of course there were also ghosts who were unbothered:\u3010I finally died after much effort. I'll never go back to work again!!!\u3011\u3010Either way I can't starve to death, so there's no way I'm working!\u3011Lu Lingxi almost went bald from the stress of selecting resumes. Seeing this, Yu Zhengdu gave her a small suggestion. \"You can try something we use in the mortal realm?\"Lu Lingxi looked at him curiously. \"What?\"Yu Zhengdu: \"If a business in the mortal realm gets a bunch of resumes, they'll use the legendary 'Moral Character Filter' to pick out those with bad moral character and directly throw that half away.\"Lu Lingxi was mind-blown. \"\u2026\u2026You can do that?!\"Yu Zhengdu: \"Yeah, there's a program for that\u2026\u2026But normally there's still so many miscreants in the remaining half that they'll fish out the resumes they had originally tossed in the trash.\"Lu Lingxi felt great resonation with his words. \"\u2026\u2026That's a little too realistic.\" Wasn't that exactly what had happened to her when they were hiring a programmer?She looked at Yu Zhengdu miserably. \"I think I will need to ask you to buy me a wig soon\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu laughed loudly and comforted her. \"You don't have to worry so much. I'll write a filter program for you.\"Lu Lingxi was overjoyed. \"Really?\"Yu Zhengdu nodded. Filter programs were easy, he would only need a moment to finish one. As long as Lu Lingxi correctly set up her requirements, it would be able to automatically filter out resumes that weren't good matches. Those too old, too young, or who had died in a bad way could all be removed in an instant. Not only this, but it could also select out priority interviewees, such as those who had prior experience working the same job when alive.With this, Lu Lingxi's workload decreased immensely. She exhaled a long sigh of relief and said, \"As expected, the company really needs a programmer ah.\"Yu Zhengdu finally added, \"Our company not only needs a programmer, but also a product manager. I strongly demand that the company hire a professional Internet product design manager.\"Lu Lingxi's expression immediately became despondent. \"For a web product designer, we'd have to hire from the mortal realm.\"This position was the same as that of the programmer. It had been created just as business related to the Internet started taking off. Yet, the development of the Internet in their country hadn't matured until 20 years ago. Even those who had been among the first to work in the field were still in their prime; other than the ones who had died from accidents, there weren't any ghosts in the Underworld capable in this area. Not to mention that there weren't many ghosts who had died from accidents. As for the ones who did, many had been traumatized by the job. And Shang Que was picky too, not wanting anyone bald\u2026\u2026This was also the reason they had previously been forced to hire Yu Zhengdu from the mortal realm.Yu Zhengdu looked at her and said very seriously, \"If you don't hire one, you might see the ability to have a reincarnation gift package lottery in the Life and Death Account system\u2026\u2026\"Beautiful little Boss's eccentric ideas never ceased to amaze him.Lu Lingxi: \"\u2026\u2026?????\"Yu Zhengdu nodded with an expression that said you understand. \"The contents of the gift package include but are not limited to: The chance to win the lottery once after reincarnation, a healthy body and spirit that will never get sick, a setting that guarantees a 100% chance of stepping in dog poo\u2026\u2026\"Lu Lingxi solemnly nodded. \"We'll hire one! Immediately!\"Luofeng was a company that emphasized productivity. After confirming that they needed to hire from the mortal realm, Lu Lingxi immediately put up a notice on a hiring website.But Luofeng's popularity in the mortal realm couldn't be compared to their popularity in the Underworld. Though all factions of their company were progressing rapidly, their introduction still made them look like a small startup that specialized in pyramid schemes. A week after the ad was put up, they only received a dozen or so resumes. And over half of them were ma.s.s resume submissions that didn't fulfill the requirements of the position at all.Skilled individuals that worked with the Internet were rare, and good product managers were few and far in between. If a company like Luofeng wanted to get a capable product manager, they would have to spend an immense amount of money\u2026\u2026They had to admit, that was entering their blindspot.Finally, even Lu Lingxi couldn't help but ask Yu Zhengdu, \"Why did you apply to our company back then?\"Yu Zhengdu was silent for a second. He covered his face and said, \"At the time I just wanted to get two months of intern salary before graduation\u2026\u2026\"Who knew that their contract was so amazing!Lu Lingxi glanced at the date, then said with great sorrow, \"What a pity, all the upcoming graduates have already graduated at this time. Even if we wanted to trick a temporary intern again, we wouldn't be able to\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\"At this time, Shang Que suddenly peeked in from outside the door. He furrowed his brows and looked at Yu Zhengdu. \"So you were originally planning on coming for two months and then leaving?\"Yu Zhengdu reflexively wanted to nod, but a sudden bout of survival instinct caused him to stop before he could. \"I wasn't, I didn't.\"Shang Que stared at him for a bit. He ultimately didn't say anything, only turning around and leaving.Yu Zhengdu innocently turned to Lu Lingxi. He lowly said, \"Actually I wanted to leave the first day.\"Lu Lingxi hushed him. \"Don't say anymore. Be careful of becoming a chicken in your next life.\"Because the amount of resumes sent in was too little, Lu Lingxi directly forewent determining if they were suitable for the position and asked everyone to come in for an interview.The two interviewed people for over half the day. Their expectations kept dropping, until finally they found a girl who had worked for two years previously and seemed trustworthy. Yu Zhengdu didn't dare to be choosy anymore, so discussed with Lu Lingxi about whether or not they should just hire this girl first.Lu Lingxi had nothing to say about this decision, so asked the girl a last question. \"If you have any questions about our company, you can ask them now.\"The girl nodded and asked, \"Do you normally have to work overtime at this company?\"She was a bit embarra.s.sed. \"That is\u2026\u2026I'm a little scared of the dark. If I go home too late, I'll get scared.\"Yu Zhengdu was silent for a moment. \"You aren't scared of ghosts, right?\"Hearing this, the girl urgently shook her head, then nodded. \"\u2026\u2026I know there are no such things as ghosts, but I'm just a little frightened.\"Yu Zhengdu and Lu Lingxi looked at each other. Lu Lingxi silently walked the girl out of their company. \"We'll let you know.\"When she came back, Yu Zhengdu was sprawled on top of the table. \"I almost forgot, we have to find someone who isn't scared of ghosts\u2026\u2026\"\"There's only one person left.\" Lu Lingxi flipped through the resume and felt like she wanted to cry. \"This resume doesn't even have the major on it. After graduation, they spent a year working at home\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu replied weakly, \"\u2026\u2026Seeing as he's already here, we might as well tell him to come in.\"The applicant was named Zheng Yan. He was a young man who had been working for one year. The school he graduated from was pretty good, but he didn't indicate his major on the form. After graduation, his work experience also wasn't ideal; on the resume, it said that he had been doing business with his family.Yu Zhengdu sighed. He could almost predict his days working with Boss and his strange ideas once more already.As soon as Zheng Yan walked in, he first handed them a stack of materials. \"These are some products I made while in university and some that I made for fun after graduation. Please take a look.\"Yu Zhengdu grabbed them from him to take a look, and suddenly sat up straighter. He didn't expect for the designs made by Zheng Yan to be so good. Though they appeared to be created by a novice, at least there was also noticeable potential.Yu Zhengdu was overjoyed and discussed some topics involving product design with him. He discovered that Zheng Yan was only missing hands-on experience, but aside from this, his thought process was the best out of all the other interviewees. And he had low expectations salary-wise!Yu Zhengdu couldn't help but feel that something was off. \"If you're so interested in product design, why didn't you immediately get a job related to it after graduation?\"With Zheng Yan's abilities, if he had partic.i.p.ated in his school's career fair right after graduation, he would have had no problem being accepted into a good business. Now that he had wasted a year and was applying as someone who was already a working member of society, it would be difficult for him to even get an interview at a good company.At this, Zheng Yan's expression was depressed. \"My family wouldn't let me. They were adamant about me going back to inherit the family business\u2026\u2026\"Inherit? Business?Little commoner Yu Zhengdu immediately became alert. \"Could it be that, your family is rich?\"Only to see Zheng Yan's mouth twitch. After a long time, he finally spoke. \"No, my family is\u2026\u2026a family of Daoists\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026????\"Instead, it was Lu Lingxi who nodded. \"I've heard about those. Some Daoists have family legacy.\"\"I didn't expect anyone to know about it.\" Zheng Yan looked at Lu Lingxi, appreciation in his gaze. \"A lot of people a.s.sume that Daoists are votarists, but actually some have family legacy. Like my family. But my generation coincided with the One-Child Policy, so I was the only one born. Because of this, my dad is adamant about me inheriting his mantle; he even forced me to major in religious studies\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu suddenly realized, no wonder he didn't fill out the major portion of his application. After all, it didn't seem very Internet related at all.Zheng Yan looked at them, a little sheepish. \"But after coming into contact with the Internet and product design, I knew that that was what I truly wanted to learn. I would often secretly sneak into other majors' cla.s.ses, but my dad still took me home after graduation to be a Daoist monk\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu couldn't help but tease him. \"So you were a Daoist monk for one year. You didn't successfully comprehend the Dao?\"Zheng Yan complained: \"Comprehend my a.s.s. I'm just not cut out for that stuff. Besides, what year is it. Who still believes in that superst.i.tious stuff. Even they're saying that the power of the G.o.ds is weakening\u2026\u2026\"Here, he paused for a moment before carefully rewording his sentence, \"That is, that's what my family said. I actually don't believe any of it, so I ran away from home earlier to pursue my previous dreams.\"He shrugged, and, as if worried that Yu Zhengdu would be biased against him because of this, guaranteed once again, \"I'm really not superst.i.tious.\"\"That's fine, that's fine. We are a very understanding company,\" Yu Zhengdu said while smiling. \"We also welcome our religious friends to join.\"\"Really?\" Zheng Yan's face immediately lit up with joy. Honestly, this company didn't look that great; if this were when he had first graduated, he probably wouldn't even be applying. But now, he was someone who couldn't find a job. Finally there was a company that didn't scorn his previous work experience, so naturally he was ecstatic.\"Really.\" Yu Zhengdu nodded, then held a hand out. \"If you have no other thoughts, we've already decided that we want to hire you.\"Zheng Yan excitedly shook his hand. \"Thank you. I will definitely work very hard.\"After declaring his determination, Zheng Yan finally remembered the formal business. He inquired again, \"Oh right, I haven't asked yet. What product am I working on after starting here?\"\"That's a long story\u2026\u2026\" It wasn't that Yu Zhengdu purposefully wanted to keep it a secret, but he really didn't know how to begin explaining. He thought about it then said, \"How about, I grab some files for you to look at.\"Zheng Yan nodded, so Yu Zhengdu stood up to get the materials. Coincidentally, Zheng Yan received a call from home at this time.\"Dad, say no more. There's no way I'm going back.\" Because he had been confirmed for a job, Zheng Yan was confident. Even his voice rose a few octaves without him knowing, \"Science is what causes society to move forward. I'm going to fall into the embrace of the high-tech industry. I refuse to have anything to deal with G.o.ds or ghosts anymore!\"\"\u2026\u2026Yes, I've already found a job. How about you take on another disciple, I really have no talent in this field.\"\"\u2026\u2026How did you calculate that I'm destined to be with ghosts? Didn't I do a year of spell-casting with you? I really didn't sense any special powers. No is no, you need to stop lying to yourself.\"After Zheng Yan hung up, he saw Yu Zhengdu holding his laptop and looking at him with a conflicted expression.Zheng Yan immediately explained, \"That was my dad. He hasn't given up yet, but don't worry. He'll understand sooner or later. After all, technology is advancing so quickly, he'll know eventually that my decision was correct.\"\"Oh no,\" Yu Zhengdu interrupted him. \"Um, how about, before you actually decide, first watch something.\"Zheng Yan was a bit perplexed. \"What?\uff1f\"Only to see Lu Lingxi stand up and slightly smile at him. \"Let me perform walking through the wall for you.\"Zheng Yan: \"?????\"The next second, Zheng Yan: \"!!!!!!\"Zheng Yan: \"f.u.c.k!!!!!!!!!!!!!\"The author has something to say:Zheng Yan's Dad: Son, you really are destined to be with ghosts\u2026\u2026Zheng Yan: Impossible! I don't believe it!Will be updating 10 extra chapters of NTNH between now and Sat.u.r.day morning (PST) because I reached my goal on Ko-fi! Woohoo! Thank you guys ^^Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayActually Yu Zhengdu didn't want to be scaring Zheng Yan so early on either, but though it was easy to fool someone in a different position, it would be impossible to do the same for Zheng Yan because his work was to be directly responsible for the web design of the Life and Death Accounts.He just didn't expect that his reaction would be so big\u2026\u2026What happened to the descendant of a Daoist family who had witnessed many things before?Only to see Zheng Yan's face turn ghastly pale in an instant. He started screaming on the spot and sounded like a chicken. At the same time, he began hurriedly pulling out yellow talismans from his pockets while chanting, \"Demon, demon king be controlled. Serve m-me Xuan\u2026\u2026Aaah, I forgot the second half\u2026\u2026\"He stuck his arm out and tossed, throwing the yellow talismans all over the room. Then, he began flipping through his backpack, grabbing a small peach wood sword the length of his palm and an eight trigrams mirror. He yelled, \"Don't come over here. I'm the direct disciple of Ledu's Zheng Daoist Clan. If my sword reaches you, your blood will spatter everywhere!\"Yu Zhengdu, Lu Lingxi: \"\u2026\u2026\"The two of them silently stared at Zheng Yan, who had so confidently told them he wasn't superst.i.tious, and watched as he kept pulling out device after device. Yu Zhengdu almost spat out the cla.s.sic line: Chang Wei, you still say you don't know martial arts!After Zheng Yan had finally pulled out everything from his backpack, Yu Zhengdu finally speechlessly said, \"As expected of someone from a family of Daoists. You've really got all the equipment.\"Zheng Yan had a peach wood sword in one hand, an eight trigrams mirror in the other, and prayer beads around his wrist\u2026\u2026For a moment, the atmosphere in the meeting room was so awkward it almost solidified.Zheng Yan realized he had just proven himself wrong too, but there was a living and breathing ghost standing in front of him right now. He had no time to care about his reputation, so lied through his teeth, saying, \"I-I-I, I was fooling you guys before\u2026\u2026Actually I-I, I'm the most talented disciple of our Zheng Clan. I once killed 300 ghosts in one night. Ones like you, I can easily\u2026\u2026one a sword blow. I'm warning y-y-you, you guys. If you're knowledgeable, you'll hurry and run now\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu: \u2026\u2026Little old brother, did you know that you're shaking?He slowly said, \"Mr. Zheng, please calm down. I'm a human.\"Zheng Yan was bewildered for a moment and picked up the eight trigrams mirror to wave in front of him. He scooted closer to get a better look, than went \"yi\" in confusion. \"You really are. How come you're with a ghost?\"Yu Zhengdu's heart was tired. \"Because I work here ah\u2026\u2026\"Zheng Yan, with a shocked expression: \"How are you so brave?\"He held out the peach wood sword and poked Yu Zhengdu, extremely confused, \"And there's no Underworld energy on you\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu obviously wouldn't willingly share the story of how he was greedy about wanting social insurance and consequently fell into a deep pit of ghosts. He could only dryly relay what Shang Que had told him back then, \"Don't worry, we're an official business registered with the Industry and Commerce Bureau. Also, we work 9 to 5, get the weekends off, and have the 5 insurances and housing fund\u2026\u2026\"\"Official employees also receive many benefits. Not only will you be impervious to all evil beings, if you accidentally run into a ghost, the company will help you take care of that too\u2026\u2026We are a good business that deserves your trust.\"Lu Lingxi couldn't help but glance at him out of her periphery: \u2026\u2026She had to admit, Student Xiao Yu's ability to adapt was truly too strong.Zheng Yan, with a look of confusion: \"\u2026\u2026What?\" There are such good things?!Under Yu Zhengdu's placation, Zheng Yan finally calmed down. But mainly this was because Yu Zhengdu really was a human, so Zheng Yan's trust in him was that between two of the same kind.As Yu Zhengdu explained the company's circ.u.mstances to him, Zheng Yan's expression became more and more broken. After he finally finished listening, he felt that his entire worldview had been shattered and remade in those ten short minutes.Zheng Yan and Yu Zhengdu looked at each other for a long time before he finally regained his wits. \"Are you guys telling the truth?\"Yu Zhengdu nodded, and even took out his photo with Wei Xiao and them to introduce their previous successful cases. \"Look, these are some of our past collaborators; they've maintained a close business relations.h.i.+p with our company\u2026\u2026\"Zheng Yan's ultimate goal was to work in the Internet related field. He knew all about Wei Xiao and the other famous people within the field, so immediately recognized him. He suddenly went \"ah\u2014\u2014\" and asked, \"Is that Wei Xiao?\"Yu Zhengdu didn't understand why he was suddenly so excited and said, \"Yeah, he's one of our biggest customers. He comes to the company once a month!\"\"He's my idol!\" Zheng Yan stared at the picture and couldn't even s.h.i.+ft his gaze. \"I bought his\u300aDouble Horn Product Reasoning\u300b; it was written so well! He's definitely the best in the nation regarding product reasoning!\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\"He didn't expect that the idol of the successor of a Daoist family would be the boss of a game development company\u2026\u2026No wonder he couldn't comprehend the Dao.Yu Zhengdu asked, \"So do you want to join our company?\"Zheng Yan replied without any hesitation, \"Yes!\"A company that even Wei Xiao collaborates with, it must be a good company!With Zheng Yan's addition, one of Luofeng's biggest problems was also resolved. Except, though Zheng Yan had good sense and a grasp of the basic concepts, he ultimately was still a novice. In the beginning, he couldn't completely enter into work mode.But they solved this problem pretty quickly too. Because Zheng Yan asked Yu Zhengdu to get an autograph from Wei Xiao for him, Wei Xiao casually inquired about it and discovered that their company had recently hired a newbie product manager.These days Wei Xiao didn't only want to be Luofeng's client. He knew better than anyone what prowess this company had. Especially because of his daughter, he had continually been searching for the chance to further his relations.h.i.+p with Luofeng. Thus, he took initiative and suggested that he could help Zheng Yan with his work, of course, disregarding the parts that would expose the product's secrets. He would only point out a few product concepts and methods.To be personally taught by Wei Xiao was almost every product manager's dream. With this, Zheng Yan completely forgot the horrors of working with ghosts and developed boundless energy towards work.At the same time, the new ghostly employees their company had hired all entered their roles too. Because the office s.p.a.ce in the technology park was limited, they could only hold the beginners' training session at the ancient well reincarnation point. At least there was a whole tourist attraction there for them to use, which was plenty of s.p.a.ce.But soon after, several local news channels reported:\u300aTemperature in Three Chambers' a.s.sembly Hall Suddenly Drops, Likely Related to Underground River Connected to Ancient Well\u300b\u300aTemperature in Three Chambers' a.s.sembly Hall Uniquely Different, May Become New Place to Hide From the Heat\u300bAfter predicting that their company would be hiring a bunch of new employees soon, always using a tourist attraction wasn't the best plan, so Yu Zhengdu couldn't help but ponder, \"Should our company upgrade to a bigger office?\"Yu Zhengdu's work started going smoothly, but for some reason, he recently always felt that something was off.He thought about it very carefully for a bit before suddenly realizing that in the past few days, Shang Que had very rarely come to bother him.Upon recalling the exact time a little more specifically\u2026\u2026it seemed to have started from after the day he said that he originally only wanted to work for two months and then leave.Yu Zhengdu didn't think that Shang Que would get angry over a small thing like this\u2026\u2026Boss's petty image is so consistent!Yu Zhengdu didn't know why either, but he just felt a little uneasy. But specially going to explain to Boss also seemed a bit like declaring there was no silver here.He was concerned for two days. Then, his cla.s.s's group chat exploded:Zhang Qingqing:\u3010Did you guys see the notification? The student representative for our school's graduation is Guangzong?\u3011Cla.s.smate A:\u3010I did! Guangzong is so cool! Fist salute.jpg\u3011Cla.s.smate B:\u3010That's not it. Didn't someone say master Jiao Shanlan is going to come back this year to donate to the school? Won't the student representative be able to see him backstage?\u3011Cla.s.smate C:\u3010!!!!! I'm jealous. Jiao Shanlan is my idol. Guangzong can you get an autograph for me?\u3011Hou Guangzong:\u3010Un, that's nothing. landry is Nova's CTO. I work at Nova, so there'll be plenty of opportunity to meet him later on. I'll get one for you when I get the chance\u3011Cla.s.smate A:\u3010I almost forgot. Guangzong was the one who got an offer from Nova\u3011Hou Guangzong:\u3010Haha, actually there's something else I haven't told anyone yet. You guys don't spill the beans ah\u3011Hou Guangzong:\u3010After landry comes back this time, he won't be the CTO anymore. He's arranging to start his own independent laboratory that will be in charge of specially developing new products. It's considered preparation for our factory's future plans\u3011Cla.s.smate A:\u3010Wow, as expected from someone on the inside. Knowing more news than the rest of us\u3011Cla.s.smate B:\u3010The real winner of life, I'm kneeling\u3011Zhu Yan:\u3010Heh heh, Student Guangzong trusts us so much. Everytime he knows news that can't be shared, he tells our group. Fist salute.jpg\u3011Hou Guangzong:\u3010\u2026\u2026\u3011The conversation continued in the chat, but there were also some cla.s.smates close to Yu Zhengdu who messaged him privately. Among them, Zhu Yan was the most agitated:Zhu Yan:\u3010Zhengdu, what happened? How come the student representative is that Hou Guangzong a.s.shole?\u3011Zhu Yan:\u3010What level is he and what level are you? If this isn't a py transaction I'll eat my shoelaces!\u3011Zhu Yan:\u3010Even if it's not you, it shouldn't be him? So many people in our school are going to graduate school or going abroad. Which one isn't better than him!!!\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010Calm down!\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010It's only a student representative position, not something big. It's not like he's stealing my eggs\u3011Zhu Yan:\u3010Is it just about being student representative!!!! That position is a symbol of four years of glory!\u3011Zhu Yan:\u3010And there's the chance to interact with Jiao Shanlan in close proximity!\u3011Zhu Yan:\u3010Do you know how rare of an opportunity that is?\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010\u2026\u2026It's okay.\u3011Zhu Yan:\u3010Choking you.jpg\u3011Yu Zhengdu ignored Zhu Yan's wailing and stood up to go to Shang Que's office.Shang Que was sitting in front of his computer, his chin resting on his hand, eyes blankly staring at the screen. Yu Zhengdu couldn't tell what he was doing.\"Boss.\" Yu Zhengdu stuck a hand out and waved it in front of his face.Shang Que focused again and glanced quickly at him before turning his attention back onto the screen. After, his eyebrows furrowed and he angrily shouted, \"Who! Who is so brave that they dared to kill me!\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\" Didn't expect for Boss's condition to be so serious already. He didn't even notice he got killed\u2026\u2026Shang Que unwillingly exited his game before asking, \"What?\"Yu Zhengdu: \"The day after tomorrow our school is taking graduation pictures. I want to take a day off.\"Shang Que made a noise of acknowledgement. \"Okay.\"Yu Zhengdu paused, and upon seeing that he had nothing else to say, made to leave. \"Then I'll go now.\"Shang Que called out, \"Wait a moment.\"Yu Zhengdu paused, only to see Shang Que solemnly looking at him. They stared at each other for a moment, silent. Yu Zhengdu finally couldn't resist and asked, \"Is there something else?\"Shang Que directly gazed at him and responded with a question, \"You don't have anything else to say?\"Yu Zhengdu was a bit bewildered. He thought really hard but still shook his head in confusion. \"No.\"Shang Que continued to glare at him. \"Think harder.\"Yu Zhengdu was silent. Then, he very sincerely suggested, \"Or you could give me a hint?\"Shang Que crossed his arms in front of his chest. His displeasure was painted all over his face. \"\u2026\u2026You can leave.\"Yu Zhengdu walked out and stood in place to ponder for a brief period of time. He really had no idea what was going on.Fu City University was famous in their province for being filled with talents. Especially the School of Information Technology that Yu Zhengdu and his cla.s.smates were in, which was the best college in their university. Every year on the day of their school's graduation ceremony, the school parking lot would be filled with expensive cars. Occasionally someone of important standing would appear too.But their college's graduation ceremony was extra special this year because a legendary alumni of their school, Jiao Shanlan, the current chief technology officer of the biggest Internet-related company in the nation, jokingly known as Cosmos Factory but actually named Nova Technology, was returning to donate to the school.Jiao Shanlan had an innumerable amount of fans at his alma mater. Because of this, on the day of graduation, the school's auditorium was busy like never before. Several students from other colleges had come too, trying to get a look at this legendary graduate.Instead, it was the students of the same college that had no energy to pay attention to what was going on with Jiao Shanlan, because they were busy lining up and taking graduation pictures. They only felt that the large crowd of people caused them a lot of inconvenience.Because of his outstanding appearance and professional skills, Yu Zhengdu was somewhat famous in his college. Right now, he was surrounded by the younger students who had come to congratulate him. His hands were full of bouquets that had been shoved at him, and there was an abundance of gifts on the ground next to him. The gifts were being watched over by his dad and mom who had specially come to attend his graduation ceremony.\"My turn my turn.\" A baby-faced s.h.i.+mei finally squeezed her way next to Yu Zhengdu. Amidst the chaos, she grabbed onto his arm. 's.h.i.+xiong, let's make a heart.\"Yu Zhengdu was extremely tired, but he knew that his s.h.i.+dis and s.h.i.+meis meant well, so didn't reject them. He could only bitterly smile while allowing them to do as they wished.Though they already knew Yu Zhengdu was popular at school, n.o.body expected him to be so popular. His cla.s.smates had originally received the treatment of regular graduating students, but compared to him, the treatment seemed extra cold and cheerless.Everyone was quite envious; someone shouted, \"Zhengdu, go farther away to take pictures! With you standing here, my dad's going to think that I've been singled out by everyone at school!\"All the others joined up in fighting the common enemy: \"Exactly exactly!\"As expected, that student's dad was sitting next to Father and Mother Yu. He looked at the large pile of presents by the two and felt grieved. \"Is your son too popular? Or has my son been bullied?\"\"What are you saying, aren't they all in the same cla.s.s.\" Father Yu hurriedly handed him a bottle of water to relieve the other's awkwardness.Yu Zhengdu laughed loudly too and purposefully joined in the others' play fighting. Their cla.s.s was pretty close, so became a loud group in only a moment. The s.h.i.+dis and s.h.i.+meis who had originally only surrounded Yu Zhengdu thus started cheering for the others too, making the whole scene even noisier.Amidst the uproar, only Hou Guangzong's expression was unhappy.He had especially worn a customized brand-name suit today, and was also the student representative for the graduation ceremony. He should've been the center of attention, but that t.i.tle had so easily been stolen away by Yu Zhengdu. Of course he couldn't find it in himself to smile.His parents who were holding things next to him also slightly furrowed their brows. Father Hou asked quite disgruntledly, \"Guangzong, who is that person? How come everyone is gathered around him?\"Hou Guangzong lightly hummed, \"That's Yu Zhengdu.\"Father Hou's expression slightly changed. \"He's\u2026\u2026that person?\"Hou Guangzong gestured for him to speak softer, then nodded.The disdain on Father Hou's face was evident. \"He's only a trivial character with no authority or power. He'll never amount to much.\"Mother Hou added on too, \"Don't worry. Your auntie will be here to cheer for you soon. And you're the student representative. There's no need to care about such trivial characters.\"At this, Hou Guangzong's expression finally relaxed, but he still couldn't help sneakily peeking in Yu Zhengdu's direction. The liveliness there made him feel extremely displeased.Thankfully, the scene that so irritated him finally changed a moment later. The crowd of people around him separated and a middle-aged woman dressed luxuriously appeared under the protection of her personal chauffeur. She walked elegantly towards Hou Guangzong, her impressive entrance and wealthy aura immediately drawing the attention of several others.Hou Guangzong was instantly ecstatic. He shouted, \"Auntie.\"\"Guangzong, happy graduation. I hope you will ride on the crest of success..\" His auntie smiled and grabbed a bag from the chauffeur to hand to him. \"This is Auntie's graduation present for you.\"The bag was simple but exquisite. There was a large logo on it.There were several students of Fu City University who had seen many things before, so someone immediately yelled out the name of a famous brand.Hou Guangzong was also overjoyed as he took a look in the bag. He reached in and pulled out a box; there was a watch inside.A student who recognized it instantly yelled, \"f.u.c.k, the lowest price for that watch brand is 200,000 RMB!\"\"Goodness, you normally can't tell. Guangzong's family is actually so bada.s.s?\"\"Not necessarily. Isn't that his auntie? It's probably his auntie's family that's bada.s.s?\"\"That's fine too. I want an auntie that'll gift me a watch worth tens of thousands as well.\"Only to hear Hou Guangzong's auntie say, \"I looked into it this morning, you're already on the back-up list for Jiao Shanlan's laboratory. From now on, you'll be working with society's elites; you mustn't lose face in front of them. Auntie is giving you this watch so you'll look more official.\"Hou Guangzong was immediately ecstatic. He promptly hugged her and said, \"Thank you Auntie.\"As soon as their conversation ended, the students around them truly exploded.\"What? Guangzong got into Jiao Shanlan's laboratory?\"\"Didn't they say it was the back-up list? It isn't confirmed yet, right?\"\"Even if it's just back-up that's already really good. I heard those in Jiao Shanlan's laboratory are all the best people in Nova.\"\"Guangzong really hides things well. I seriously couldn't tell before that his family was so bada.s.s and he had such great skills.\"\"f.u.c.k, I'm about to turn into a lemon spirit.\"As Hou Guangzong spoke to his auntie, he used his peripheral vision to scan his cla.s.smates' reactions. Upon seeing that everyone's attention was finally on him, and especially that they all had on expressions of envy and jealousy, he finally felt an unprecedented sense of fulfillment.So what if Yu Zhengdu had better skills and was more popular? Wasn't he still worse than him in every other way?He couldn't help but turn his gaze onto Yu Zhengdu, wanting to enjoy the other's expression of surprise and astonishment. But what he actually saw almost angered him to death.Yu Zhengdu who was supposed to be like everyone else, envious and jealous of him, was playing on his phone with a look of nonchalance!!!Yu Zhengdu actually wasn't playing with his phone. It was only because after everyone suddenly turned their attention on Hou Guangzong, he finally had some free time; coincidentally, Shang Que had just sent him a message on WeChat.Shang Que:\u3010.\u3011Yu Zhengdu examined it for a while, but still couldn't understand what Boss meant. Out of some unknown reasoning, he randomly sent Shang Que an invitation to video call.Yu Zhengdu turned the camera to face the scene and turned in a circle, smiling as he said, \"It's really lively today.\"On the other side of the camera, Shang Que went \"un\". Though his expression didn't really change, his eyes were glued on Yu Zhengdu.Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\" Once again, Boss's gaze is really hard to decipher.At this time, Shang Que suddenly spoke. \"Why is that person staring at you?\"Yu Zhengdu was briefly stunned. He followed the image on the screen to look behind and discovered that Hou Guangzong kept glancing at him from time to time.His mouth twitched. \"He's jealous of me.\"Shang Que went \"oh\" and was just about to say something, when suddenly, the surroundings erupted with a sound of \"hong\u2014\u2014\". Everyone immediately exploded, like a drop of cold water dripping into a boiling pot of oil.\"Jiao Shanlan is here\u2014\u2014\"\"It's Jiao Shanlan, he's walking in this direction\u2014\u2014\"\"Aaaaah, landry my idol\u2014\u2014\"\"Where where?\"\"Look in the direction of the parking lot. He's walking with the princ.i.p.al!\"Amidst the loud crowd, a path had been squeezed out by a group of bodyguards. Through the gaps between their bodies, one could barely see an average looking middle-aged man making his way over, surrounded by a group of the school's administrative staff. This was who frequently appeared on the news: Jiao Shanlan.They saw Jiao Shanlan speak with the principle while they walked, occasionally lifting his face to wave at the students.Suddenly, Jiao Shanlan paused. His gaze turned in the direction of Yu Zhengdu and his cla.s.s. In the next moment, he lowered his head to say something to the principle, then stepped through the wall of bodyguards to walk in their direction.The students parted for him like the sea parted for Moses; everyone watched Jiao Shanlan in excitement.Among them, Yu Zhengdu's cla.s.s was the most enthusiastic. They could all tell that Jiao Shanlan was walking towards them.\"f.u.c.k, landry is coming over??\"\"Aaaah, why is he coming in this direction?\"At this time, a smarter student had already turned his gaze to look at Hou Guangzong. His voice was envious, \"Why else? Isn't there someone in our midst who's about to join his laboratory?\"\"Oh right, Guangzong!\"Everyone finally remembered the gossip they had just heard and simultaneously turned their heads to look at Hou Guangzong.Hou Guangzong reflexively tugged on his collar and stood up straighter. Though his expression was calm, his slightly trembling fingers exposed his excitement.His auntie had seen more impressive things than this before, so only slightly arrogantly said, \"Jiao Shanlan is pretty tactful.\"Only to see Jiao Shanlan slowly come closer, finally reaching their cla.s.s. Then, he took a turn and walked in front of Yu Zhengdu. He stuck out a hand and smiled, \"You must be Zhengdu? I'm lan.\"Yu Zhengdu hurriedly shook hands with him politely. \"Haha, h.e.l.lo, lan.\"\"You look better in person than in your pictures,\" Jiao Shanlan said. \"I just sent you a bunch of messages but you didn't respond. I was worried I wouldn't be able to find you.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"Is that so? I was taking pictures just now, so didn't get the chance to check my phone.\"Jiao Shanlan sighed in relief, then continued, \"How about it? Have you finished considering my invitation for you to join my laboratory?\"Yu Zhengdu's expression was apologetic. \"I really can't do this year. I already accepted other work.\"Jiao Shanlan felt great pity. \"Ey, I already invited you a whole year early, how come you accepted other work ah\u2026\u2026\"As the two spoke, the mouths of the students around them all slowly became \"o\" shaped.Jiao Shanlan and Yu Zhengdu knew each other?He invited Yu Zhengdu to join his laboratory a year ago?And Yu Zhengdu rejected him!!!!!!!!!!One after another, these messages shocked the students so much that though they wanted to cause an uproar, they didn't know how to make noise anymore, and all remained silent.A cla.s.smate found the most important point. \"f.u.c.k, what company is so awesome that Zhengdu rejected Jiao Shanlan's invitation???\"I know the answer to that question!Zhu Yan felt incredibly proud. He put his arms on his waist and answered for Yu Zhengdu, \"A company where even the CEOs of Double Horn Technology, Excellent Jade Corporation, and Wind Riders Technology have to grovel to see Zhengdu.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZhu Yan's voice wasn't very loud, but the surrounding students were very close to him. Someone immediately asked in shock, \"Really?\"Another person was somewhat confused. \"What? I heard from Guangzong that Zhengdu's company was really bad?\"Everyone else nodded too. \"I heard from Guangzong as well. He said the company Zhengdu's at right now is really small, and apparently does pyramid schemes\u2026\u2026\"\"Bulls.h.i.+t!\" Zhu Yan was even more agitated than the person they were speaking of. His voice even raised in pitch, \"Is Hou Guangzong crazy? Does he think he's hot s.h.i.+t just because he got an offer from Nova? Looking down on this company and that kind of work, even starting a rumor that Zhengdu's company does pyramid schemes?\"\"I personally saw how Wei Xiao spoke to Zhengdu. He was terrified that Zhengdu's company wouldn't collaborate with him, okay!\" Zhu Yan was scared that his words weren't trustworthy enough, so tugged at Zhang Qingqing too. \"Qingqing, hurry and tell everyone. Did your big boss beg to collaborate with Zhengdu or not?\"Zhang Qingqing thought about it. \"It's really hard for someone at my level to see the big boss normally\u2026\u2026But our supervisor told me a couple times that when Zhengdu came to our company, the Big Boss always personally greeted him\u2026\u2026\"Here, Zhang Qingqing finally realized something. \"Goodness, I was wondering why my supervisor was better to me than to all the other interns. It wasn't because of Zhengdu, right?\"Zhang Qingqing's words seemed to confirm the credibility of what Zhu Yan had just shared. Immediately, their cla.s.smates were shocked.What kind of company could make the CEOs of businesses like Double Horn Technology and Excellent Jade Corporation scramble for a collaboration?Or could make Yu Zhengdu reject Jiao Shanlan's invitation to join his laboratory, the dream opportunity of so many people?On the other side, Jiao Shanlan was regretfully talking to Yu Zhengdu. Because he was on a tight schedule, he couldn't stay for long. \"It was my fault too. I thought it would be easy for you to get an offer from Nova with your skills, so didn't let HR know beforehand. I didn't think they would rescind your offer.\"Yu Zhengdu thought it was nothing, so said, \"No worries. Getting the offer or not really doesn't affect me much.\"\"It affects me a lot.\" Jiao Shanlan sighed. \"I had already planned the lineup for my founding team. You were supposed to be the best young member, I even came up with a plan for dividing shares too. I haven't found another young person with the same skill level as you yet. When I'm done working on the things currently at hand, I definitely need to pay a visit to HR and ask for an explanation for you.\"Yu Zhengdu lightly coughed. \"You could, but it's really not necessary.\"Jiao Shanlan chatted with him some more before regretfully leaving.But the shock he had brought with him didn't dispel so easily. Instead, after he left, the students who previously only dared to chat quietly began to gossip without fear.\"f.u.c.k f.u.c.k f.u.c.k, landry personally invited Zhengdu to join his laboratory? And as a shareholder?\"\"Am I the only one who thinks it's reasonable? Zhengdu is the best in our major; he even got a national award before. If landry wants to find a young person to join, isn't he the most reasonable choice?\"\"Ke, what was it, didn't someone say Guangzong was on the back-up list?\"\"Wasn't he the one who said whether or not he was on the back-up list? The most we can confirm now is that Jiao Shanlan doesn't know who he is.\"\"Not that I'm trying to imply anything, but Zhengdu is really too lowkey. He never even mentioned this?\"\"No s.h.i.+t!\" Zhu Yan b.u.t.ted into the conversation, \"Zhengdu's really busy. He doesn't have the time to announce all his little accomplishments in the group chat.\"Hou Guangzong's face alternated between turning red and white. His palms were slightly sweaty. He had never imagined, not even in his wildest dreams, that the halo and attention he had worked so hard to get could be so easily taken back by Yu Zhengdu. He had also never imagined that Yu Zhengdu and Jiao Shanlan knew each other from long before.Unwillingness, awkwardness, and terror rose in his heart. He stood in place and felt that his limbs could no longer move.Coincidentally at this time, Zhu Yan enigmatically made a quip at him. Everyone present was from the same cla.s.s, who couldn't tell who Zhu Yan was talking about? In a moment, all the eyes previously on Yu Zhengdu subtly moved onto Hou Guangzong.Hou Guangzong felt even worse. He looked at his auntie in panic. \"Auntie, I'm really on the back-up list, right?\"His auntie was a lot calmer than him. At this, she furrowed her brows and said, \"Of course. I'll tell you outright, that isn't a back-up list, you'll definitely get in. Does Jiao Shanlan dare to disrespect your uncle?\"Hou Guangzong felt more confident, but lowly asked again, \"But Jiao Shanlan knows Yu Zhengdu. That\u2026\u2026won't be a problem, right?\"His auntie scoffed. \"You mean that broke student? Who is he? Can Jiao Shanlan really stand up for him? Forget the fact that he didn't get into that whatsit laboratory. Even if he did, I can make him leave.\"She caressed Hou Guangzong's head, \"Guangzong, don't worry. You'll move on to do great things in the future, so you need to set your sights further in the distance. There's no need to keep your eyes on such trivial characters who will never amount to much. You're lowering your own price by doing that, you know?\"Mother Hou agreed, \"Exactly. Think about your uncle's abilities. As long as you listen to your auntie and do well, everything will be fine. You don't need to worry about anything else.\"Hou Guangzong finally completely relaxed. He looked at Yu Zhengdu, satisfied, only to find that the other hadn't even glanced in his direction once. At a time like this, he was playing on his phone again!!Yu Zhengdu didn't have time to pay attention to him. As soon as Jiao Shanlan left, he heard Shang Que's voice coming out from the phone, \"So you wanted to run off with that guy?\"Yu Zhengdu finally remembered that he was still video calling Shang Que. He hurriedly held up his phone to look, only to see that Shang Que was staring at him through the screen. He was elegant as usual, and his eyes were trying to communicate something Yu Zhengdu couldn't understand\u2026\u2026as usual.And also what kind of question was that\u2026\u2026Yu Zhengdu didn't know why he felt so sheepish, only vaguely replying, \"\u2026\u2026That's all in the past.\"Shang Que was silent, then ended the video call.Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\" What's the situation? Is he angry or not?He was in the middle of being confused when Zhu Yan yelled at him from the side, \"Zhengdu, it's time for our cla.s.s to take a group photo\u2026\u2026Who were you video calling?\"Yu Zhengdu put his phone away and answered, \"My boss.\"Zhu Yan went \"f.u.c.k\": \"Your boss really isn't human. Making you work overtime at night and not even giving you a break for your graduation ceremony!\"Yu Zhengdu glanced at him, speechless, then threw an arm around his neck as they walked off. \"Shut up. Let's go take the picture.\"After taking the group photo, everyone split into their separate groups once more. Because of Jiao Shanlan's appearance, the crowd surrounding Yu Zhengdu became even larger. Whether or not they knew him, they still gathered by him, wanting to see what kind of student could be so favored by landry.On the other hand, the area around Hou Guangzong's family, who thought they were better than everyone else, seemed a bit desolate. Mother Hou felt embarra.s.sed, so found a random topic. She asked her son, displeased, \"Guangzong, how come your girlfriend still isn't here? They've already finished taking the group photo.\"\"Just wait a moment more. She's on the way,\" Hou Guangzong explained as he looked at his phone, \"She's one of the performers at the graduation ceremony today, so just finished rehearsals.\"As they were speaking, they heard a sudden commotion. The crowd of s.h.i.+dis and s.h.i.+meis surrounding Yu Zhengdu announced in surprise, \"Wow, Mingyi s.h.i.+jie is here too.\"\"Mingyi s.h.i.+jie is still so pretty!\"Everyone looked over, only to see an exceptionally pretty girl walking over from not far away with a bouquet of flowers. She was the major flower of the broadcasting major. Because she was good looking and quite talented, she partic.i.p.ated in almost every school-wide performance and was the dream girlfriend of an innumerous amount of male students, even more famous at their school than Yu Zhengdu.As soon as Fang Mingyi appeared, people immediately started throwing suggestive looks at Yu Zhengdu. This was because Fang Mingyi had previously been pursuing Yu Zhengdu. Last semester, it had even been rumored that they went out on a few dates. But in the end, no one knew why they suddenly stopped.Now that Fang Mingyi had appeared here, the implication was obvious.As expected, Fang Mingyi walked up to Yu Zhengdu and slightly smiled. She said, \"Zhengdu, happy graduation.\"Yu Zhengdu politely nodded back. \"Thank you.\"The surrounding cla.s.smates, s.h.i.+dis, and s.h.i.+meis immediately caused an uproar: \"Woah\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\"Before they even finished with the \"oh\" sound, Fang Mingyi had turned around and walked over to Hou Guangzong with the bouquet. With everyone's attention on them, the two gently embraced. Fang Mingyi softly said, \"Guangzong, sorry I'm a little late. I rushed over right after rehearsal.\"\"It's nothing. I'd never get mad at you.\" Hou Guangzong grabbed the flowers from her, then pecked her on the cheek. Finally, he introduced her to his auntie. \"Auntie, this is my girlfriend, Fang Mingyi.\"His auntie walked in a circle around Fang Mingyi, examining her, before nodding in satisfaction. \"Xiao Fang, was it? Guangzong told me about your situation. It's only getting into a TV station, I'll just put in a word for you later.\"Fang Mingyi didn't display an ecstatic reaction, maintaining her composure instead. She politely responded, \"Thank you Auntie.\"Hou Guangzong's auntie saw that her behavior was collected and was thus even more pleased.The crowd that had just been causing an uproar while looking at Yu Zhengdu subsequently became silent. Awkward expressions appeared on their faces.Zhu Yan couldn't help but ask Yu Zhengdu lowly, \"Zhengdu, what happened? Wasn't Fang Mingyi pursuing you?\"\"Ah?\" Yu Zhengdu was currently looking at his phone. He had sent Shang Que a message, but hadn't received a response in a while. How petty, making him so anxious. Now he didn't have the energy to pay attention to anybody else. After being asked by Zhu Yan, he finally answered, perplexed, \"I don't know. We just went out to eat a couple of times. That's not considered pursuing, right?\"\"Why not! It's always been others pursuing Fang Mingyi, when have you ever seen her asking someone else to hang out?\" Zhu Yan hit his arm, hating that iron wasn't becoming steel. \"It was definitely because you weren't considerate enough that our lovely G.o.ddess has been unearthed by a pig!\"Yu Zhengdu looked at him, speechless. \"You don't need to be so excited?\"\"You're really maintaining your single status through your skills!\" Zhu Yan's heart hurt. \"How pretty is Fang Mingyi? Do you know how many people at our school pursued her? Yet you don't think it's anything important?\"Yu Zhengdu side-eyed Zhu Yan and continued to pretend that he couldn't understand what he was saying.Of course he didn't really not know that Fang Mingyi was pursuing him. He had even watched a few movies with Fang Mingyi under his peers' pressuring, trying to develop more feelings. Unfortunately, none appeared, and Fang Mingyi suddenly started avoiding him.As a homebody dedicated to technology since birth, Yu Zhengdu's views on love were to go with the flow. Fang Mingyi stopped looking for him, so he stopped paying attention.Now that he saw Fang Mingyi and Hou Guangzong were together, it naturally wouldn't be right for him to confirm that Fang Mingyi had pursued him before. He had to save some face for the girl.But he never imagined that his cla.s.smates would feel injustice for him.At this time, the counselor for their cla.s.s squeezed into the crowd and yelled at Hou Guangzong, \"Guangzong, hurry and go backstage to prepare your speech. The ceremony is about to start soon. Senior Jiao Shanlan is there too, you can chat and become more familiar with him.\"The counselor's voice was quite loud; with this shout, everyone suddenly remembered that Hou Guangzong was the student representative who would be giving a speech during today's ceremony.Hou Guangzong replied, \"I'll go in a bit.\"But he was ultimately a little scared, so looked at his auntie again, \"Auntie, Jiao Shanlan shouldn't\u2026\u2026\"His auntie waved a hand at him. \"I knew you'd be worried. I just called to have your uncle let him know. All you need to do is relax.\"At this, Hou Guangzong finally smiled a real smile. \"Thank you Auntie.\"Auntie continued, \"Put the watch on. It'll look good onstage.\"Afterwards, she glanced at Fang Mingyi. \"Xiao Fang, how about you put the watch on for Guangzong.\"Fang Mingyi took the watch over from Mother Hou, surprise in her eyes. Then, she smiled shyly, \"Okay.\"She helped Hou Guangzong put on the watch properly, then gave him a lot of face by pecking him on the cheek.Originally Fang Mingyi's arrival alone had already caught everyone's attention. Now that she took the initiative to kiss Hou Guangzong, he immediately became the envy of all the boys present.Zhu Yan was so p.i.s.sed he wanted to die. He held his chest and exclaimed, \"Such a natural beauty, but what a pity, she has been unearthed by a pig!\"Yu Zhengdu: = = He was deeply suspicious that Zhu Yan was the one who had a crush on Fang Mingyi?After Zhu Yan sighed, he glued himself onto Yu Zhengdu's neck once more. \"I dare to confirm that Hou Guangzong definitely has connections. Otherwise how could he steal your student representative spot with his own abilities? And dig a hole in your wall?!\"To the side, a content smile finally appeared on Hou Guangzong's face. He felt that the displeasure caught in his throat for the longest time had finally been removed.So what if Yu Zhengdu was the best in their major? So what if he was surrounded by so many students? So what if Jiao Shanlan personally invited him?Wasn't he still stuck in a stupid little company? Didn't he still have nothing? Didn't the school's most famous G.o.ddess still run into his embrace?This was ultimately a world that belonged to those with power and authority. He would always remain stepping on Yu Zhengdu's head.With everyone's attention on him, Hou Guangzong stood up straighter and adjusted the hem of his s.h.i.+rt. He made to follow the counselor backstage.He hadn't even taken a step forward when the uproar from a nearby crowd stopped him. He could faintly hear the female students screaming, \"Wow\u2014\u2014That person is so good-looking!!!\"\"Is it a celebrity? Is it a celebrity?\"\"I'm going to pa.s.s out. You guys hurry and call him over to kiss me ah\u2014\u2014\"The commotion got larger and larger, even attracting the attention of Yu Zhengdu and the rest of his cla.s.s. But because the crowd was packed so tight, they really couldn't tell what was going on.Zhu Yan couldn't help the disdain in his voice, \"Students these days, really have no restraint\u2014\u2014\"As he was speaking, Yu Zhengdu suddenly received an invitation to video call from Shang Que. A perplexed Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026?\"Zhu Yan saw the nickname that was on his phone too: My broke-a.s.s Boss.He immediately shouted, \"Your boss is really too much, serial calling? Ignore him!\"Yu Zhengdu side-eyed Zhu Yan, then silently answered the call.As soon as the image popped up, Yu Zhengdu became shocked. He saw Shang Que furrowing his eyebrows and asking, \"Where are you?\"And on the other side of the camera, behind him, was a group of students dressed in their graduation gowns. There were even girls screaming, \"He's really so handsome\u2014\u2014\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026!\"He looked up and over, only to see the crowd in front of him slowly part. Accompanied by the students' surprised and curious gazes and inhales, a tall young man appeared in everyone's field of vision.He was casually dressed in a white collared s.h.i.+rt and informal pants, making his person seem pale and neatly put together. His eyes were deep, like bottomless pits. In his hands was a huge bouquet of flowers; he looked in Yu Zhengdu's direction, then slowly walked over, relaxed and elegant as usual.Everybody's gazes followed as he moved.He walked forward, step by step, before, under everyone's eyes, he finally stopped in front of Yu Zhengdu and handed the bouquet of roses over. \"Happy graduation.\"The students: \"\u2026\u2026?????\"f.u.c.k, what plot was this?Such a big bouquet of roses? Could this man be\u2026\u2026????These days everyone's thinking was a lot more open, especially that of university students. The sudden appearance of such a devastatingly handsome young man gracefully holding a bouquet of roses, looking so gently at Yu Zhengdu\u2026\u2026Everyone immediately came up with a 10,000 word plot in their minds.f.u.c.k, no wonder Yu Zhengdu wasn't together with Fang Mingyi. Turns out he didn't like girls\u2026\u2026Ah, that wasn't right. Actually, it should be said that the person he was into was extremely good looking. This had nothing to do with gender; it didn't matter if Fang Mingyi was a boy or girl, she still wouldn't be considered a rival.Even Father and Mother Yu were dazed at this scene. Mother Yu almost bruised Father Yu's arm with how hard she was pinching him. \"Lao Yu, how come Xiao Shang has gotten even better looking!! Hurry and invite him over for the Dragon Boat Festival!\"Father Yu: \"\u2026\u2026\"Zhu Yan was strangely angry. \"Yu Zhengdu, I'm mad! Do you smell the sour odor emanating from my body?\"Only to see that Yu Zhengdu was shocked too. He slowly looked up at the handsome young man: \"Boss, why are you giving me roses?\"Shang Que casually answered, \"I bought these outside your school. This was the only bouquet left.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\"Everyone else: = =So, this guy was actually Yu Zhengdu's boss?And he bought the roses on the way? There was no other meaning?Everyone thought they had gotten excited over nothing, and finally exhaled out the breath they had been holding.Only to hear Shang Que continue, \"Don't go to that whatsit laboratory. Being a shareholder is nothing. If you want them, I can give you our company's shares too.\"Everyone else: \"\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026????\"The author has something to say:The cla.s.smates: \u2026\u2026What kind of G.o.dly boyfriend!\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Wait, what kind of G.o.dly boss?!!!!Father Yu: = = JealousPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs soon as Shang Que spoke, the surrounding students simultaneously gasped.Had they heard wrong?Give-give-give, giving shares?The school newspaper's reporter who was hiding among the crowd and originally wanted to interview Yu Zhengdu even came up with a headline in their head:\u300aShocking! To Fight For One Male Student, the Bosses of Two Companies Publicly Did This During the Graduation Ceremony\u2026\u2026\u300bEveryone turned to look at Yu Zhengdu in shock. They actually already knew that he was skilled; after all, he had appeared on the school's official website and won a national prize before, but they hadn't imagined that he was skilled to this degree. Two big bosses already begging for him to join their companies as shareholder, and right after graduation.There was no need to talk about what level Jiao Shanlan was on.Though they were uncertain about the background of the man in front of them, adding together the facts that he could make Yu Zhengdu reject Jiao Shanlan to join his company and also all the information Zhu Yan had revealed earlier, it seemed that his company should be at least a little better than Jiao Shanlan's laboratory.But most importantly, the boss was so handsome\u2026\u2026and was so gentle to his employees.What kind of G.o.dly company was this? And what kind of G.o.dly boss ah?Only to see Yu Zhengdu hurriedly shake his hands, \"Don't don't don't, there's no need to be so polite.\"Just their ghost\u00b7company, signing a contract could cause rebound at any time, much less owning shares!Shang Que's gaze dropped. \"You still want to go to that laboratory?\"Yu Zhengdu didn't know how to answer either. He originally wanted to say that he wanted to wait for his current contract to expire, but upon seeing Boss's expressionless face, he somehow seemed to be able to discern what he was feeling for the first time.Boss seemed to be a little nervous\u2026\u2026Finally, Yu Zhengdu scratched his head. \"I'm not going anymore.\"At this time, Father Yu who had been off to the side watching the presents finally couldn't hold himself back. He b.u.t.ted in, holding on to Shang Que's hand and refusing to let go: \"Xiao Shang, you really can't give us anything else. I still don't even know what present to return you after that set of antiques last time.\"Shang Que's hand was caught in Father Yu's grip. He seemed quite uncomfortable and tried to yank it back, but couldn't. It was obvious how excited Father Yu truly was.Shang Que could only say, \"Antiques are antiques. Shares are shares.\"Father Yu's heart instantly stung. \"\u2026\u2026We can't afford to return a present to you for either!\"With this interruption, the talks about giving shares stopped. The surrounding students completely froze this time.This boss\u2026\u2026had gifted Yu Zhengdu antiques??????What happened to the same world, same kind of boss?How come Yu Zhengdu's boss is different from everyone else's!!! Did he secretly add credit when he reincarnated?Zhu Yan couldn't help himself from asking, \"Boss, is your company still hiring? Zhengdu and I are from the same dorm. I'm graduating with honors and easy to use!\"Yu Zhengdu: = =Shang Que slowly looked over Zhu Yan. His eyes stopped at the arm he had swung around Yu Zhengdu's neck. He asked, \"Do you have no muscle strength?\"Zhu Yan: \"\u2026\u2026\" This boss really isn't a human! Why are his words so venomous!He furiously cussed him out in his head, but still carefully took his hand back under Shang Que's gaze.Shang Que's appearance doubtlessly traumatized a lot of their surrounding cla.s.smates. Everyone present was a graduating student, but how come some people were already so far ahead?Among them, the one who had been hurt the most was Hou Guangzong.His work, graduation gift, and beautiful girlfriend, all meant to be points of envy, became Yu Zhengdu's background once again with Shang Que's appearance.\u2026\u2026Yu Zhengdu seemed to be that hurdle he couldn't cross in life!He loathed him!n.o.body was paying attention to Hou Guangzong. Even Fang Mingyi's expression wasn't so great.Finally, Hou Guangzong could only grab Fang Mingyi with a dark expression on his face. \"Let's go, we need to head backstage to prepare.\"After they took the group photo, the graduation ceremony was about to start too. The students gathered in groups of two and three to walk towards the auditorium.Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que walked together. He was still explaining why he had started working at Luofeng back then.Starting in university, Yu Zhengdu had used the ID of 'singer\" to be active on the starflicker forum. Because his skills advanced extremely rapidly, he quickly became one of the masters on the site, and also subsequently became acquainted with lan, osone, and the others.There were actually a lot of guesses regarding the true ident.i.ties of lan and the others on the forum. People knew that with their capabilities, they had to be important people in the field. But it wasn't until Yu Zhengdu was in his last year of university that he knew lan was the legendary graduate of their school, Jiao Shanlan.And he only revealed that because Jiao Shanlan was planning to start a laboratory and consequently wanted to invite Yu Zhengdu to join.Because Jiao Shanlan had still been overseas at that time, Yu Zhengdu went to attend Nova's campus hiring alone. With his abilities, he should have been able to secure an offer from Nova quite easily. Thus, Jiao Shanlan didn't specially tell the company's HR representatives to take note. The original plan was for him to transfer Yu Zhengdu into his laboratory after it was formed; this way, it would be more official too.But neither of them imagined that after the New Year, Yu Zhengdu would receive a notification from Nova saying that his offer had been rescinded.This obviously wasn't normal. Yu Zhengdu was on high alert from the beginning, and suspected that someone had purposefully taken his spot.Soon after, his suspicions were proven to be true. Hou Guangzong, whose skills were subpar and who had initially failed Nova's hiring test, suddenly got in.Though Yu Zhengdu couldn't be 100% sure that Hou Guangzong was the one who had taken his spot, he knew that things definitely weren't as simple as they seemed.The addition or removal of an employee for a company on the scale of Nova didn't cause any noticeable effects. If the other party had connections and only wanted to get into Nova, then it was entirely possible to ask Nova to simply add a spot on the list. There was no need to remove his offer.The only explanation was, the other couldn't bear to see him appear at Nova.With this thought in his mind, Yu Zhengdu naturally also realized that the other would continue watching him from the shadows. Unless they were sure he couldn't regain his footing again, they wouldn't leave him alone.The feeling of being watched by someone wasn't a good one. Yu Zhengdu didn't want to spend his days before graduation keeping an eye on others, so planned to find an inconspicuous little company to work at first. He wanted to make the other lower his guard.Either way he had already finished discussing with Jiao Shanlan about work a long time ago. As soon as Jiao Shanlan returned to the country, he would directly join the laboratory.Of course, he could also spend this time collecting evidence. When the time was right, he would give the other an unexpected blow.The plan was originally impeccable. The only problem was the multiple job seminars their school had held before graduation. They emphasized the importance of labor contracts and social security, which resulted in his first reaction upon getting hired at Luofeng to be signing the contract.Though the time he was going to be working wasn't long, he still needed the basic protections\u2026\u2026\"\u2026\u2026That's basically everything that happened.\" Yu Zhengdu sighed. He still felt a little guilty sharing the truth, because he had somewhat used Luofeng as a coverup in his plan. But in actuality, he was the one who had fallen into a pit.He could only say this was karma. Of course, at this time, he felt more conflicted than he did at the beginning.He would understand if Shang Que was angry. After all, Shang Que had been pretty good to him\u2026\u2026If it were him who had treated an employee so sincerely, only to find out the employee had always been thinking of jumping s.h.i.+p, his mood wouldn't be great either.Shang Que held onto the bouquet of roses, an indecipherable expression on his face. But his voice was lower than usual, \"Something must be wrong with that Hou Guangzong!\"Yu Zhengdu froze for a second. \"What?\"Only to hear Shang Que cussing, \"The amateurs always cause more trouble!\"Yu Zhengdu: = = A normal beautiful boss, his aura being held back by games. Who knows if spending money can prevent him from learning all this trashtalk\u2026\u2026Shang Que freed a hand and a cold smile appeared on his face. \"Let me lower the thunder fire and smite him into a burnt dog.\"\"Calm down, calm down!\" Yu Zhengdu hurriedly pressed his eager hand down. \"You're the respected Ghost King of Luofeng Mountain. Disputing with the likes of him is too degrading.\"Shang Que thought about it, then reluctantly lowered his hand. \"You're right.\"Yu Zhengdu tilted his head to look at him, slightly surprised. \"Aren't you mad?\"Shang Que stared at him. \"Of course! But didn't you tell me he wasn't worth fussing about?\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\" Clearly, he and Boss weren't on the same wavelength once again.But he was weirdly touched, too. He never imagined that Boss's initial reaction after hearing everything wouldn't be to be angry at him for using Luofeng as a stepping stone, but to help him yell at Hou Guangzong first.Yu Zhengdu: \"I meant\u2026\u2026The fact that I planned to jump s.h.i.+p after graduation\u2026\u2026\"\"It's not in my place to be angry about that?\" Shang Que held onto the roses and exclaimed arrogantly, \"You were originally going to go to that person's company, but ultimately came to our company. If anyone should be angry, it should be him!\"Yu Zhengdu: \u2026\u2026Boss, pa.s.ses logic\u221aBut although Shang Que wasn't angry, he was still a bit worried. He said, \"Actually our company's benefits aren't bad. When your contract expires, I hope you can consider renewing ah\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu laughed. \"I'll seriously consider it.\"The a.s.sembly hall at Fu City University was very large. Because of this, aside from the graduating students, a few students per major could also bring one family member in with them. Yu Zhengdu had luckily won one of these slots. He originally planned to bring his mom in, but after Shang Que arrived, Mother Yu said she would wait outside with Father Yu. She gave the opportunity to Shang Que.Yu Zhengdu led Shang Que to find their spots. As soon as they sat down, people from all around looked over.There was nothing to do about it. He himself was handsome; Boss was even more handsome. Now that the two of them were sitting together, they were the brightest corner in the entire auditorium.Some people hadn't been present earlier, so didn't know what was going on. They wanted to gossip but didn't dare to ask in person. One secretly sent a WeChat message to Yu Zhengdu:\u3010The guy next to you is so handsome! Who is he? Your friend? Older brother? Relative?\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010\u2026\u2026My boss.\u3011Cla.s.smate:\u3010??????? You brought your boss to attend our graduation ceremony?\u3011Cla.s.smate:\u3010What benefits did your boss give you? Is he sharing stock with you?\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010\u2026\u2026Yeah 0.0\u3011The cla.s.smate was dazed by his response. He was just about to tease Yu Zhengdu a bit more, only to hear a cla.s.smate nearby explaining to someone else, \"That's him, f.u.c.k. Yu Zhengdu's boss. To compete with landry for him, he just said that he was going to give Zhengdu shares when we were outside\u2026\u2026\"Another person said, \"I'm Buddhist, Yu Zhengdu is so bada.s.s. But his boss is so handsome. landry can't compete in this regard. If it were me, I'd choose him!\"The cla.s.smate just about to tease Yu Zhengdu silently changed his message:\u3010It is I who have lost.jpg\u3011Yu Zhengdu laughed and didn't reply. He was just about to put his phone away when he received a notification from Jiao Shanlan.lan:\u3010Zhengdu, sorry. I don't think I can do anything about your offer being rescinded\u3011lan:\u3010Someone put a word in. This issue has been covered up by the superiors, I can't continue looking into it\u3011lan:\u3010I'm very apologetic about not being able to give you justice\u3011lan:\u3010But I can still guarantee your acceptance into my laboratory. If you want it\u3011Yu Zhengdu thought about it, then replied with a dumb panda sticker:\u3010You could, but there's no need.jpg\u3011Shang Que noticed that he didn't seem to be in a great mood, so leaned over to ask, \"What's wrong?\"Yu Zhengdu thought about it, then directly pulled up his chat history and handed his phone over for Shang Que to look at. He said, \"Actually I don't need lan to help me. I already made a program that can hack into Hou Guangzong's laptop and computer. It's collected more than enough evidence.\"According to Yu Zhengdu's original plan, he didn't need Jiao Shanlan to do anything. He had plenty of evidence in his possession. As long as he sent these to Jiao Shanlan, that would be enough for him to act on.But now Jiao Shanlan had made himself known too soon. The person behind everything would have time to prepare a backup plan ahead of time.If Yu Zhengdu sent the evidence to Nova's administration now, they would definitely hide it. To take it a step further, this event might even be detrimental to Jiao Shanlan.After hearing everything, Shang Que expressed his confusion. \"Just because of something so trivial?\"Yu Zhengdu side-eyed him. \"Us mortals are commonly bothered by these trivial daily things. You aren't even human, how would you understand\u2026\u2026\"Shang Que thought about it, then fished around in his pocket. He pulled out a small item and handed it to Yu Zhengdu. \"Since you don't want the company's shares, I'll give you this instead.\"Yu Zhengdu looked over, only to see an iron ball in Shang Que's hand. It was around the size of a pigeon's egg and black all over. There was a mysterious icy glint to it.Several black lines suddenly appeared on Yu Zhengdu's forehead. \"Even though us programmers truly do need to train our fingers, you don't need to give me a hand bead? Besides, this is a little small. How would I coil it?\"Shang Que was silent for a moment, before he slowly said, \"This isn't a hand bead\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu thought of his previous actions and immediately gasped. \"It's not another antique, right? I'm not taking it!\"Shang Que: \"\u2026\u2026It's not.\"Yu Zhengdu was thoroughly confused, but still held a hand out to receive it. \"Then what is this?\"But Shang Que flipped his palm over and took the gift back. \"Have you heard the story of how before Yama begins court, he first swallows an iron ball?\"Yu Zhengdu shook his head in confusion.\"Can you learn some more about things related to the company?\" Shang Que was slightly exasperated. Then, he stuffed the bouquet of roses into his arms and said, \"I'll give it to you later. Be right back.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026??\" Which good new socialist youth would spend their free time studying about h.e.l.l!In just a moment, the announcement system inside the a.s.sembly hall turned on with a \"weng\". The emcee walked onstage to the cheers of the audience. The graduation ceremony began.According to schedule, the princ.i.p.al spoke first. He summarized the results they had achieved within the past four years and specially praised the exceptional students in this year. But those students paying extra attention noticed that Yu Zhengdu's name wasn't part of that list.Technically, Yu Zhengdu should've been the most famous student in their college.After the princ.i.p.al finished, the main event began. Jiao Shanlan arrived onstage and began talking. He had donated quite a sum of money returning to school this time, and was the idol of several students. Thus, the atmosphere immediately became more rowdy, filled with continuous cheers.After Jiao Shanlan finished speaking too, over half an hour had already pa.s.sed. But Shang Que still wasn't back.Yu Zhengdu held onto the roses and looked at the empty spot next to him. For some reason, he was a bit anxious.Onstage, the emcee appeared once more and announced that they would be entering the next segment. The student representative would be bestowing the honorable alumni award to Jiao Shanlan, then would give a final speech.Because Jiao Shanlan had already set the mood, when Hou Guangzong stepped onstage, his cla.s.smates gave him a lot of face by applauding loudly and enthusiastically.Hou Guangzong wore an obviously expensive custom outfit and walked across stage with a blissful expression on his face. He politely saluted everyone, then picked up the medal from the tray held by the ceremony a.s.sistant and awarded it to Jiao Shanlan.Another round of applause.After completing this entire procedure, Hou Guangzong finally straightened his tie and steadily walked in front of the podium. He cleared his throat into the microphone. At this time, he suddenly felt something cold in his throat. Immediately after, his stomach dropped, as if something had fallen into it.He was bewildered and looked around, but found nothing out of the ordinary.That was probably an illusion? He thought.At the same time, Shang Que finally came back, elegant as usual as he sat beside Yu Zhengdu. He very naturally fished the roses back to hold.Yu Zhengdu asked, \"Where did you go? What took so long?\"Shang Que didn't say anything, only smiling and gesturing for him to look onstage. Yu Zhengdu was suspicious, but still turned his gaze in the direction of the stage.Onstage, Hou Guangzong had already finished preparing for his speech. He scanned the audience confidently, his gaze finally lingering in the front row.His parents and auntie were all sitting in the first few seats, looking up at him proudly.Their child was finally on the path to success.Only to hear Hou Guangzong excitedly speak into the microphone, \"Leaders, cla.s.smates, everyone, greetings. Today, the first thing I want to say is\u2014\u2014everybody seated here today is all tras.h.!.+\"Everyone: \"\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026???\"Yu Zhengdu: \"Pu\u2014\u2014\"The author has something to say:Shang Que: For youZhengdu: \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Pigeon egg????? (bus.h.i.+)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs soon as the words escaped Hou Guangzong's mouth, the crowd went into an uproar.The students looked at each other. Several of them suspected they had heard wrong.Father and Mother Hou, who had originally had their chests puffed out in pride waiting for their son's speech, were bewildered too. They looked at each other. Mother Hou asked in confusion, \"What is Guangzong saying?\"Older people didn't really understand Internet slang as much, but the word \"trash\" was simple and direct. Anyone could tell that it wasn't meant as praise.Hou Guangzong himself was shocked too. The phrase that he had just said hadn't been in the script he had prepared\u2026\u2026But, it was what he had been thinking in his head. The question was, how did he randomly blurt out what he wanted to say?He panicked inside and tried to calm himself down. He thought that maybe he was too excited so forgot to uphold his image. That would explain why he had suddenly lost control of his mouth and accidentally spoke the truth.At least his words could be taken as an Internet joke. He could still save this.At this time, all the audience's gazes were on him. If anybody had been having small conversations on the side before, now everybody's attention was captured by Hou Guangzong after the shocking statement he had just made. They wanted to see what kind of speech would lead with such a strange opening.Hou Guangzong smiled stiffly. He cleared his throat again and said, \"I was just joking with everyone before. What I really wanted to say was, you guys\u2014\u2014you guys\u2026\u2026\"He wanted to say something smooth to casually change the topic, but at this time, it felt like something flooded into his brain. It banged around, left and right, causing immense pain in all his organs. It felt like his muscles were about to tear apart. He held onto the plastic microphone but couldn't speak at all.Hou Guangzong's face paled. He started sweating intensely as he freaked out internally. An urge to speak the truth brewed inside him. He looked into the audience, lost. Coincidentally, he met his father's gaze. Father Hou mouthed, \"Guangzong, hurry and say something\u2026\u2026\"Hou Guangzong nodded, then spoke, \"None of you are as good as me. Even though in the past four years, my grades haven't been as good as your guys', but isn't my job now still better? My girlfriend is prettier than yours, and even the person giving the speech today is me\u2026\u2026\"These were all the most sincere thoughts hidden deep in his heart. He didn't dare to say them normally, but now that he had just blurted them out, he suddenly felt so much more comfortable. The pain shooting through his organs dissipated slightly too.But the audience had already exploded like a drop of water falling into a pot of oil. His cla.s.smates caused an uproar, turning around to converse with each other in disbelief. Even the school's administrative staff were shocked. They temporarily forgot to take action and stop him.A student with a bad temper couldn't hold himself back anymore. He stood up and pointed at Hou Guangzong, then shouted, \"Hou Guangzong, what the h.e.l.l are you saying, you dumba.s.s? I dare you to say it again!!\"Zhu Yan was surprised too. He started telling the cla.s.smates around him, \"Holy s.h.i.+t, Hou Guangzong has become a bit too hubristic. He's bragging in front of all these people?\"\"Seems like the cla.s.s group chat and his WeChat Moments weren't enough for him. He needed a bigger stage!\"At this time, Hou Guangzong realized what he had just said too. He panicked internally and wanted to explain, but as soon as he opened his mouth, the unknown energy inside his body started churning his insides again. His face paled as the extreme pain forced him to speak the truth. \"You guys don't know, right. My uncle is an important government official for the city. He has a lot of power. All it takes is one word from him for me to get into companies like Nova. And after, I get to go into Jiao Shanlan's laboratory too. Either way, the distance between us keeps getting bigger and bigger. All you guys can do in the future is be jealous of me\u2026\u2026\"As soon as he said this, Jiao Shanlan's expression changed from where he had just stepped offstage.Jiao Shanlan spun on his heels and returned onstage. He grabbed the microphone from the emcee's hand and told Hou Guangzong, \"This student, I recall that I haven't approved your entry into my laboratory yet?\"Hou Guangzong really wished his mouth would just glue itself shut. But as soon as he thought of refusing to answer, the pain inside his body started again. He couldn't help but continue to reply as a way to relieve the agony, \"With my Uncle backing me up, you won't be allowed to refuse me.\"As soon as he said this, Father and Mother Hou and his auntie who had just been anxiously watching him offstage couldn't hold themselves back anymore. His auntie stood up in a rush and yelled, \"Guangzong, hurry and stop talking!\"Hou Guangzong didn't even dare to look at his auntie aymore. If he could, he wished he would just fall off the stage, but he couldn't control himself at all.He held his chin high and puffed his chest out, righteously saying, \"No, I want to speak!\"As soon as he said this, he felt the horrifying pain in his chest greatly diminish. This made him reflexively scold his aunt, \"Auntie, even though Uncle has a lot of abilities, you need to stop acting like you're on top of the world. It's quite annoying.\"Hou Guangzong had said this into the microphone. Each word was clearly relayed to every corner of the a.s.sembly hall. With this, all the students inside were shocked out of their minds.Though Hou Guangzong's auntie was arrogant, she still knew the basic rules of being the wife of a government official. At least\u2026\u2026a sensitive topic such as using the government's power definitely couldn't be publicly discussed.As soon as Hou Guangzong said this, her eyes had rolled into the back of her head as she almost fainted. She pointed onstage and panted, \"You, you\u2014\u2014you traitor!\"At least Father and Mother Hou had fast reflexes and caught her, preventing her from really taking a fall. Mother Hou couldn't help but stomp her foot. \"Guangzong, what are you trying to do!\"Even Zhu Yan gave him a thumbs up. \"f.u.c.k, I looked down too much on this dumba.s.s before. Suicidal bragging, respect!\"A student next to him also praised, \"Too exhilarating!\"Jiao Shanlan was ultimately someone who had witnessed important things before. At this time, he could still maintain a calm front and continue to inquire, \"I remember that the student from your school who should've entered Nova was Yu Zhengdu. Later on, his offer got rescinded. You're the one who took his place, right?\"At this time, Hou Guangzong had really let himself go, completely giving up on saving his own image. He knew that as soon as he tried to be dishonest, the strange energy inside him would immediately cause him immense pain. Pain so bad that he wished he was dead instead. He could only surrender and say, \"Yes. I haven't liked him since early on. He's just an a.s.shole, pretending to be hot s.h.i.+t every day. Worse yet, there's a bunch of stupid people who like him. What's more, even though my uncle helped me get in, I still had to show that I possessed some abilities so others wouldn't talk about me behind my back. So I stole Yu Zhengdu's program to apply with. I couldn't let him show up at Nova again.\"Their cla.s.smates: \"\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\"Everyone's attention turned onto Yu Zhengdu. Their gazes were filled with sympathy and rage at the injustices against him.Yu Zhengdu as well: \"\u2026\u2026\" Actually he had known this for a while, but he hadn't expected the truth to be exposed in this manner.A long time ago, he had already uncovered evidence in Hou Guangzong's computer and phone. Hou Guangzong was so defensive against him because of a very simple reason; other than the fact that the two of them had never gotten along, it was also because the project Hou Guangzong had submitted to Nova to get accepted was stolen from something Yu Zhengdu had made during his university years.Not only this, but he had also taken other projects created by Yu Zhengdu and pa.s.sed them off as his own experiments. He had used these as the qualifications for his entry into Jiao Shanlan's laboratory.So no matter what, Hou Guangzong was determined to prevent Yu Zhengdu from entering Nova. Even to the point of wanting to obstruct Yu Zhengdu from getting into any large company that Nova collaborated with.Upon seeing the gazes of everyone around them falling on himself, Yu Zhengdu's mouth twitched. He ultimately could only cover his mouth and lower his face.Their cla.s.smates: \u2026\u2026Tragic, really too tragic!!!The honorable best student of their major has to find out such a tragic truth at his graduation ceremony. No wonder he couldn't help covering his face and crying publicly.If this were anyone else, they would cry too!Truthfully, Yu Zhengdu really was on the verge of a mental breakdown: I'm begging you to please stop looking at me! I almost can't stop myself from laughing!!!!In the end, Yu Zhengdu actually couldn't hold himself back anymore, so he simply leaned his forehead on Shang Que's shoulder, burying his face in the crook of the other's neck and softly asking, \"Boss, what was the iron ball? Hou Guangzong was such a normal show-off before. How come he's gone insane so quickly?\"Shang Que smiled elegantly and explained to him, \"In the past, because h.e.l.l was so busy, sometimes we would choose certain officials from the mortal realm to subst.i.tute in for the role of Yama judges\u2026\u2026\"Honest and fair government officials in the mortal realm would occasionally be chosen to take on the role of Yama. At night, horse carriages from the Underworld would pick them up and take them to h.e.l.l for work. Because they feared that these mortal judges would be biased towards their fellow mortals, before court, these officials would be forced to swallow an iron ball. The iron ball was created by the Heavenly Emperor and could be used to control people's hearts. After work, they would spit out the iron ball.If they did things against their original intentions or lied, the iron ball would activate, slamming against their organs. The pain would ensure the officials judged each case fairly and honestly.The pigeon's egg that Shang Que had just prepared to gift to Yu Zhengdu was the iron ball created by the Heavenly Emperor. Now, the ball was in Hou Guangzong's stomach, so he couldn't say anything he didn't think was true. All that he said and did were in line with his most genuine opinions.Yu Zhengdu couldn't help saluting, \"You ghosts still always have the best solutions!\"No wonder people used to say, if you don't do bad things normally, you won't be scared of ghosts knocking on your door in the middle of the night!Onstage, the situation was already completely out of control.Jiao Shanlan's expression spoke volumes. \"Then your uncle must really have some abilities.\"Hou Guangzong's auntie felt her vision go black after hearing this. She shakily looked behind her; to no one's surprise, almost all the students had their phones trained on Hou Guangzong, filming. She yelled in panic, \"Hurry and get that traitorous b.a.s.t.a.r.d off the stage! Hurry\u2014\u2014\"As expected, Hou Guangzong appeared to want to continue exposing himself, but the school's staff had already charged onstage to tow him off under the administration's orders.\"Let me finish talking before I go\u2014\u2014\" Hou Guangzong seemed determined to answer this question. He clung onto the podium and refused to let go, taking this last opportunity to continue speaking, \"My uncle is a government official for the city. Of course he has a lot of abilities. With one order from him, the dean had to hand over the role of student representative to me\u2014\u2014\"As soon as he spoke, the students went \"hua\u2014\u2014\". Of course, this wasn't because they were surprised. Their dean's reputation was pretty bad normally. In recent years, inst.i.tutes of higher education were no longer ivory towers. Everyone more or less knew about how corrupt their dean was, but now that this truth had been publicly exposed, the situation was somewhat different.It had to be said, the students truly felt a little elated.The dean hadn't expected to be dragged into this mess in the very end. His eyes instantly rolled back into his head and he fell on his b.u.t.t, hard.The students were engrossed in this drama. As soon as they saw that Hou Guangzong was about to be dragged away, they couldn't help but feel regret. They all started shouting, \"Don't leave!!\"\"Encore encore!! Please come back!\"\"Hou Guangzong hurry and come back\u2014\u2014I'm willing to buy scalper tickets to hear you talk!\"Zhu Yan couldn't help himself from applauding. \"Hou Guangzong, you're right! I apologize for all the bad things I said about you before. You're a real man. Brave enough to be a kamikaze!!!\"He was scared that his cla.s.smates would misunderstand, so quickly added, \"I'm adding a doge head to my own words ah, students!\"With him taking the first step, all their cla.s.smates also started clapping. The entire a.s.sembly hall was filled with thunderous applause.\"Hou Guangzong, even though you're a dumba.s.s, this time we are truly full of respect for you!\"\"We will remember you forever!!!!\"Student Hou Guangzong finally received the most respectful and sincere round of applause and admiration he had in all four years of his university life!This was the legendary 'anti-corruption schemes need to rely on direct relatives'!Student Hou Guangzong set an example personally, disregarding sacrificing himself. What a good role model!This graduation ceremony destined to be written into history books ended in pandemonium.But for the people who Hou Guangzong had publicly mentioned, the chaos had just started.After getting dragged backstage, Hou Guangzong's hair was already soaked with sweat.The thing inside his body was seriously too vicious. If he even thought about being dishonest, it would start ricocheting around. Until now, his stomach still burned like there was a fire raging inside it. He was in so much pain.The school's administrative staff was so outraged that his face had turned into the color of pig liver. \"Hou Guangzong, what you did today was seriously too out of line. The university has decided to rescind your diploma.\"Hou Guangzong wanted to cry but had no tears. He pointed at his own mouth in an attempt to explain, but couldn't say anything untruthful whatsoever.Fang Mingyi who had originally finished getting her makeup done and was preparing to go onstage to perform was shocked by this sudden episode too. She tugged on Hou Guangzong's arm and asked, \"Guangzong, what's wrong with you? Why did you say those things in front of everyone?\"Why are you asking another question!!!Every time I hear a question now, I have the urge to answer, don't you know!Hou Guangzong gripped Fang Mingyi's hand carefully, praying that his heartfelt gaze could comfort her, ensuring that she wouldn't get p.i.s.sed to death by his upcoming answer.He sincerely said, \"Didn't you know from the start? Didn't you only get together with me because my uncle could help you get into the TV station?\"Fang Mingyi's expression immediately changed upon hearing this. \"What blasphemy are you saying?\"Hou Guangzong's eyes were teary. Honest to G.o.d, he really was crying, but the words out of his mouth were enough to enrage anyone. \"I still remember when you were tailing Yu Zhengdu around two years ago. You know how many times you took the initiative to ask him out.\"At this time, there were a lot of workers still present backstage, including all the other people performing with Fang Mingyi. These students were pretty close with Fang Mingyi; normally, they all called her \"G.o.ddess\" in flattery. Upon hearing what Hou Guangzong said, they all reacted with shock. Though no one openly discussed it, they all started communicating through their gazes.Fang Mingyi immediately panicked. She swung her arm and slapped Hou Guangzong. \"Bulls.h.i.+t! I truly wanted to be in a relations.h.i.+p with you, but you've turned around and slandered me like this!\"Hou Guangzong held onto his face and started crying. He stammered out as he cried, \"Truly wanted to be in a relations.h.i.+p with me? I pursued you for three years but you didn't even budge. The day before you found out my uncle's true ident.i.ty, you even went to the movies with Yu Zhengdu. Have you forgotten?\"Fang Mingyi's face alternated between turning green and white. She didn't even dare to look at the gazes of those around them. In the end, she could only stomp her foot and scream, \"Hou Guangzong, I want to break up with you!\"After, she covered her face and ran off.At this moment, a soft gust of icy wind suddenly blew through the backstage area. Hou Guangzong's throat felt cold once more, as if something had pa.s.sed through his esophagus and left his body.He only felt a sensation of dizziness. Afterwards, he stared at the scene in front of him, bewildered. He asked in a daze, \"Yi? What happened? How did I get backstage? Wasn't it time to start the speech?\"Subst.i.tute Yama judges from the mortal realm would spit out the iron ball before dawn and return to their physical forms. When they opened their eyes once again, they would forget all that had happened overnight.Hou Guangzong's brain was currently mush. He still couldn't get a clear understanding of what was happening in front of him, only to suddenly hear his auntie screech loudly, \"Hou Guangzong, you son of a b.a.s.t.a.r.d. You've caused your uncle to get on the trending list\u2014\u2014\"Outside the a.s.sembly hall, Shang Que held his palm out to Yu Zhengdu. A small iron ball the size of a pigeon's egg with a chilling glint rested in his hand. \"For you.\"Yu Zhengdu looked at the iron ball. The disdain on his face was 120%. He said, \"Isn't this the one you just fished out from Hou Guangzong's stomach? I don't want it!\"Shang Que: \"\u2026\u2026\"He calmly threw the iron ball away, pulled out a wet wipe from who knows where, and began to wipe his hands.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter the graduation ceremony, Yu Zhengdu quickly returned to his daily working life. He had no other choice; the task of program development was imminent and he also had to find the time to take care of other orders of business. He was so busy that he even had to schedule bathroom breaks into his calendar.But the consequences of Shang Que's Yama iron pill caused an uproar in all of Fu City and even the whole country.The speech Hou Guangzong had given at the graduation ceremony had been filmed by several students and uploaded online. Immediately, Hou Guangzong's uncle, Nova Technology, and Fu City University all became points of controversy.Even though Hou Guangzong later on fervidly and resolutely denied that he had said such things, netizens didn't care about his desperate attempts to save the situation at all. They continued their search for the truth.In fact, his change in att.i.tude afterwards made people think that he had been threatened by the ones in power.An enlarged HD picture of the watch Hou Guangzong's auntie had gifted him got uploaded too. It was examined from all 360 degrees by netizens.It could be said that however impressive Hou Guangzong had been when he had received the gift was how tragic he was now.How could a watch easily over ten thousand be so casually given away by the wife of a government worker?The Fu City city council did try to delete the posts and control the comments, but there had been too many people at the graduation ceremony. They couldn't delete all the uploads because so many people had filmed it. More importantly, Jiao Shanlan, someone who held immense influence online, had been present that day too.After everything, he posted an update to his Weibo. The message was short and to the point.Jiao Shanlan landry: My heart hurts.As one of the top technology experts in the nation, Jiao Shanlan's Weibo account had over ten thousand followers. A lot of the people who followed him were people who worked with the Internet; among them, the most common were programmers.As soon as he posted this Weibo status, an innumerous amount of programmers started actively partic.i.p.ating in the search for the truth behind the entire situation. These were people who possessed the actual abilities to discover hidden information. Not even a day later, Hou Guangzong's uncle's ident.i.ty and background, along with his personnel and all the things he had done in the past, were completely unearthed. They were shared online in an easy-to-read manner.Even though Hou Guangzong desperately denied anything, everyone was still able to quickly confirm that his uncle was a committee member of Fu City's Munic.i.p.al Party. His name was Cai Jianhao. Cai Jianhao had only been transferred to Fu City a few years ago. After arriving, he had maintained a hardworking image, giving several awe inspiring, righteous speeches in different public settings. His reputation with the citizens had always been very good.In addition to this, Cai Jianhao only had a single daughter who was still in high school. She hadn't reached the age where he would need to arrange things for her, so normally n.o.body paid special attention to what he was doing.No one expected that this serious investigation would reveal that Cai Jianhao had completely faked his honest image. It wasn't the right time for him to plot a path for his daughter yet, but he had set up quite a few of his relatives and friends with good jobs. Not only did he slip them into the city's administrative department, he also snuck several people into a number of big businesses.Like the fact that he had arranged for Hou Guangzong to enter Nova Technology. That hadn't been the first time he had committed such an act.At this time, the employees at companies Cai Jianhao had forcefully stuck his relatives into started making new accounts just for the purpose of exposing him. It was revealed that Cai Jianhao had planned everything out from early on. The people he added in were all arrogant and always ordering others around. What their orders were weren't mentioned; the important thing was, these people were spies Cai Jianhao had arranged to be in these companies. It wasn't enough that they were receiving a salary. They also helped Cai Jianhao collect data on the company. As soon as any issue occurred in the company, evidence would be presented in an attempt to stir things up. Things couldn't be hidden unless the company promised benefits to Cai Jianhao.Because of this, a lot of people made the connection as to why Cai Jianhao didn't think getting Hou Guangzong into Nova was enough and was adamant about sticking him into Jiao Shanlan's laboratory too. The most advanced departments in such tech companies were filled with the most secrets, so were also the places where accidents were most likely to occur. As long as Hou Guangzong could get some dirt on them, Nova would have to suffer immensely.The deeper netizens dug, all the projects Cai Jianhao had previously stuck his fingers in in Fu City were revealed one by one. This resulted in their related departments getting exposed too.In the end, it took an order from the higher ups to somewhat control this large and chaotic exposing activity. But even then, it was impossible for Cai Jianhao and his network of spies to get off scot-free. Under the attention of the entire online community, they were all taken in for investigation.Overnight, the Fu City city council went through a large change in blood. Those enterprises that had been blackmailed by Cai Jianhao all sighed in relief, too. They fired all of Cai Jianhao's relatives and friends the very next day.Nova wasn't an exception. Even if Cai Jianhao hadn't been arrested, they would've had to get rid of Hou Guangzong based on what he had admitted during his graduation ceremony about stealing Yu Zhengdu's projects to get into the company. They needed to give the public and all their employees a fair explanation.Not to mention, Hou Guangzong had intended on polluting Nova's new laboratory project that they intended on relying heavily upon in the future.The day the video came out, a call from Nova's HR rescinded Hou Guangzong's offer. Even the employee who had connections to Cai Jianhao and who had helped admit Hou Guangzong got fired too.It could be said that because of this incident, Nova Technology completed a round of self-purification. This was something Jiao Shanlan hadn't expected would happen.The other party that got thoroughly examined because of the video was the administrative department of Fu City University's College of Information Technology. The dean, who was extremely hated upon normally by the students, was directly forced to quit his role. All of a sudden, the entire school was filled with the sounds of celebration. Everyone immediately posted online, giving thanks to Hou Guangzong.But compared to all the national headlines regarding Cai Jianhao, the situation at Fu City University seemed irrelevant. In the larger pandemonium of anti-corruption that swept up the whole city, it could only be considered a small blip.Yet, this didn't stop the students of Fu City University from adding Hou Guangzong's WeChat through several different means. Though he didn't accept any of their requests, his previous posts and what messages he had sent in the group chat had long since been screenshotted and spread relentlessly over the Internet.The incident at Fu City University's graduation ceremony had very important and enduring consequences, but for Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que, it could only be considered a tiny interference in their busy lives.At the moment, they were in a rush to head to Chuandong and help Yang Xin take a look at the problematic piece of land Excellent Jade Corporation had bought.Excellent Jade Corporation was one of the largest comprehensive entertainment companies in the country. In its early years, it had mainly focused on property management for entertainment-related industries. The earliest branded amus.e.m.e.nt park in the nation, \"Feiyu Amus.e.m.e.nt Park\", was owned by them.As of now, Excellent Jade Corporation already owned two large-scale amus.e.m.e.nt parks. As the quality of consumption increased, citizens also became more pa.s.sionate about leisurely trips. Their company had bought this piece of land in Chuandong in preparation for creating a third amus.e.m.e.nt park.In the past decade, Chuandong's economy had advanced rapidly. More importantly, the Internet had completely taken over the entirety of southeast Huaxia. Because of this, all of Excellent Jade Corporation's executives had placed a lot of trust in this third amus.e.m.e.nt park. The plan was to transform this park into the largest headquarters for comprehensive entertainment in the nation. The Chuandong government was also extremely supportive of this project and were doing their best to try and get it to monopolize all of the tourism in the east.Because of these factors, Yang Xin couldn't afford to be careless with this project at all. He didn't mind spending a small fortune inviting Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que over to take a look, even if it was only for a miniscule problem.The land Excellent Jade had acquired was in the suburbs of Chuandong. There wasn't even a hotel nearby. Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que got there a day early, so were arranged to stay in the city overnight. The next morning, a driver from Excellent Jade Corporation brought them to the construction site.The entirety of the site was enormous. The surroundings had previously been an area of urban and rural integration, but were now being demolished. There were ditches and holes all around, and dust billowed in the wind.When Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que arrived, Yang Xin and the religious master he had invited were already there. As soon as they got out of the car, Yang Xin hurriedly rushed over and received them, saying, \"Boss Shang, little Mr. Yu, you're finally here.\"Yu Zhengdu smiled and greeted him. He turned his head to the side and saw that there was an incense table set up in the middle of the empty construction area. Sacrifices, yellow talisman paper, and incense were all present. The most ridiculous offering was the entire roasted suckling pig placed on the center of the table; its skin glistened with oil and an apple was placed in its mouth. The scene seemed extremely formal.It was easy to tell how importantly Yang Xin viewed this spell-casting ceremony.In front of the incense table, two Daoists clothed in robes were preparing something. One was old and one was young. The fabric of their robes flitted in the wind, making them look quite holy.But for some reason, the figures looked a little bit familiar.\"Here please. Let me introduce you to the religious master in charge of today's spell-casting\u2026\u2026\" Yang Xin said as he led Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que in that direction,. In actuality, though, he was a bit worried in his heart.The master he had invited was one of the best in the nation. In the past, every time he needed anything, Yang Xin would always find this master first. It could be said that he was a very faithful and dedicated follower. But today, he was suddenly bringing two other people here. It was very likely the master would be displeased.Another thing was, he had been in contact with a lot of masters previously. According to his experience, most of them didn't like companies like Yu Zhengdu's.The business of high-tech luck-changing\u2026\u2026In a master's eyes, that would be the equivalent of scamming.But they really couldn't afford to be careless in the slightest regarding this project. Yang Xin didn't have the energy to care about the master's feelings.In the blink of an eye, they reached the incense table. Yang Xin said, \"Let me introduce you guys to each other. These are two masters I specially invited over from Diyang, the temple master of Qinglian Temple, Daoist priest Mu, and his disciple. You guys might not know, but Daoist priest Mu is extremely famous in our country. He's even the committee head of the Daoist Reputation Committee. It's very difficult for normal people to even meet him once\u2026\u2026\"Following his introduction, the two Daoists turned around to look. They were just about to bow to Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que, when both sides froze. All of a sudden: \"\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu thought to himself, no wonder they looked so familiar. Wasn't this Daoist priest Mu and his apprentice Yuan Qing that they had met at Chen Siyu's house? He had even added Yuan Qing on WeChat. But the other was a bit chatty: he spammed his Moments with new knowledge he gained from cultivation daily. Yu Zhengdu had blocked him.Yu Zhengdu immediately burst out into laughter. He said, \"Daoist priest Mu, Daoist Yuan, what a coincidence. We meet again.\"Daoist priest Mu's expression was respectful. He bowed at them and said, \"These two householders, it's been a while.\"His disciple Yuan Qing wasn't so reserved. Unrepressed joy flitted across his face as he exclaimed, \"To be able to run into you guys at a place like this! How wonderful! I've spent a lot of time recently combining modern technology and the path of cultivation and been extremely inspired. I was just thinking about asking you guys to discuss with me!\"Yu Zhengdu's smile froze. He was scared just looking at Yuan Qing's status updates these days; he didn't want to discuss anything with him at all.He very seriously answered, \"Actually, our company works with Internet technology. We don't really know much about Daoist cultivation\u2026\u2026\"Yuan Qing immediately became disappointed. \"Ah, is that so?\"Off to the side, Yang Xin was dazed by the scene unfolding in front of him. He blinked and couldn't help b.u.t.ting in to ask, \"Ey, you guys know each other?\"\"Yes. Though these two householders are not Daoists, they are creative in thought. They have combined modern technology with spell-casting, inventing the most advanced form of evil removal. I admire them greatly,\" Daoist priest Mu sincerely praised.Yang Xin: \"\u2026\u2026??\"Wait, what was this situation?Master, shouldn't you get angry first, yell that they're from a scamming company, then persuade me not to believe in scammers?How come you've started complimenting them?What modern technology, advanced evil removal\u2026\u2026Don't you religious masters normally love to refer to ancient texts? How come you've suddenly become so with the times?What Yang Xin didn't know was, the scenario he had thought up in his head between Daoist priest Mu and the other two had already happened. In the end, they had admitted their defeat under the absolute prowess of technology.Yang Xin was suddenly lost. His gaze was blank as he stared at Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que exchange conversation with Daoist priest Mu and his disciple. Daoist priest Mu even politely asked, \"Since these two householders are also here today, how about you guys perform this spell-casting?\"Yu Zhengdu hurriedly waved his hands. \"No no no, I'm a programmer. I don't know how to cast spells.\"Daoist priest Mu actually revealed a regretful expression before saying, \"Then I guess I will do it.\"Yang Xin: \"\u2026\u2026\"Daoist priest Mu, the famous temple master of Qinglian Temple, the committee head of the Daoist Reputation Committee, had just invited a programmer to perform a spell-casting\u2026\u2026The evil elimination ceremony wasn't very tedious. This piece of land owned by Excellent Jade also didn't contain much evil. It was only that some residual underworld energy remained from historic events. Daoist priest Mu didn't use a lot of energy before he had already finished the spell-casting.In the end, he held a bell in his left hand as his right hand formed a gesture and rested on his waist. He drank a large mouthful of water and spat it out while turning in a circle before chanting loudly, \"I lower upon this Earth one of the three lights, holy water. There is no dust between the Heavens and Earth. I burn the true essence of lilies to form auspicious clouds. Turn this mortal realm into a Heavenly one. Sincerity can move even a Heavenly heart. We hope to achieve such sincerity. To reach it, I first greet you three times and praise your sacred name.\"Then, he burned the paper with the incense and the entire ceremony was over.Yu Zhengdu reflexively started clapping. Watching the professionals truly was different. The entire ceremony even looked impressive. Super formal!Yang Xin saw that Daoist priest Mu had finished his spell-casting, so was just about to ask Shang Que and them to take another look. But he also didn't want to do this in front of Daoist priest Mu, because it would appear as if he didn't trust the other. He was in the middle of debating with himself about whether or not to ask them after sending Daoist priest Mu off.Only to see Daoist priest Mu walk over to Yu Zhengdu and very sincerely say, \"Little householder Yu, may I please ask you to use your company's Underworld Energy Detector to double check and see if I have completely cleared the underworld energy from here?\"Yang Xin: \"\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu naturally agreed. After all, they had already accepted the other's money. Thus, he took out the Underworld Energy Detector and scanned the construction site in its entirety. In the end, he gave Daoist priest Mu a thumbs up and praised, \"Master's spells were cast extremely well. It's super clean!\"Shang Que gave a rare nod of acknowledgement too. \"The old Daoist's cultivation level is not bad.\"Yang Xin watched as both parties started politely complimenting each other. He once again went: \"\u2026\u2026\"After the spell-casting and confirming that this construction site was quite safe and didn't contain any hidden evils, Yang Xin's mood was exceptionally great. He invited them to eat at a famous hotel in the city.At the table, Yuan Qing refused to give up. He scooted close to Yu Zhengdu and was adamant about sharing what he had learned about Daoism. Yu Zhengdu's head felt big listening to him talk. In the nick of time, his mom called him. He hurriedly used this excuse to avoid the other.Mother Yu didn't really need anything. It was just that they were about to buy an air purifier for home, so wanted him to help choose a brand.After Yu Zhengdu hung up and returned to his seat, Yuan Qing still hadn't finished sharing his revelations.Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\" Mom hit me again\u2026\u2026f.u.c.k, hit my phone again!Only to see a solemn expression on Yuan Qing's face. He said, \"In this time, I've very studiously learned the entire history of the development of science and technology. I've become extremely inspired and have once again realized how closed off and behind the times the current Daoist community is.\"\"Especially the history of both industrial revolutions, which was exceptionally memorable. Back then, workshops with handmade crafts all closed down under the pressure of machinery. This has caused me to fear greatly about the future of Daoism. My master's cultivation level is extremely high, but he can still only perform one ceremony at once. For example, the evil elimination ceremony today. If any other place needed it at the same time, they could only wait in line\u2026\u2026\"\"Recently, I have been thinking about how we could effectively push for a Daoist revolution. Like the industrial revolution. This way, the cultivation results of Daoism could more conveniently, rapidly, and productively enter thousands, even millions, of households.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\"Yang Xin: \"\u2026\u2026\"Yang Xin looked at Daoist priest Mu, bewildered. His lips trembled. He really wanted to say Daoist priest Mu, hurry and tell your apprentice to stop talking!Only to see Daoist priest Mu nod and say, \"Yuan Qing's idea isn't bad, but technology is the result of generations of thought and experimentation. To transfer it for Daoism's use would be a long and arduous process.\"Yang Xin: \"\u2026\u2026\" Nevermind Daoist priest Mu. You should stop talking too.Only to hear Shang Que slowly say with his chin on his hand, \"Don't you just mean the replication of cultivation results\u2026\u2026\"Upon hearing this, Yuan Qing was a bit dazed. \"Householder Shang's summary is right. But how can we replicate it?\"Daoist priest Mu added, \"Exactly. Just like today's evil elimination ceremony. How would we replicate that? It's not like we can do what they did during the industrial revolution and start producing machines, right?\"Originally, Yu Zhengdu's mouth had started twitching listening to their conversation. But somehow he instinctively responded, \"Why wouldn't it be possible? In the end, all we did today was remove some underworld energy. We can develop an underworld energy purifier.\"Everyone immediately turned to look at him: \"\u2026\u2026\"Yang Xin: \"\u2026\u2026\"Who was he? Where was he? What was he doing?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayYu Zhengdu had originally been joking when he had said that. His mom had just called him asking about an air purifier, so he couldn't help but tease the two Daoists.What he didn't expect was, the two Daoists weren't rendered speechless by his comment at all. Instead, their expressions became contemplative. Yuan Qing gaze was filled with admiration. He saluted, \"As expected, little Mr. Yu is a genius in the field of new technologies. Your brain is so clever. How come I didn't think of this before\u2026\u2026\"Daoist priest Mu also nodded in agreement. \"If we can invent an underworld energy purifier, then our followers could remove evil in their own homes instead of needing to invite us to cast spells every time. This is definitely a good idea for increasing the speed of cultivation.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\"Wait a moment. These two Daoists, you clearly weren't like this before. Can you not accept such things so naturally?He silently turned his gaze onto Shang Que, hoping to see some understanding in his boss's eyes. Coincidentally, the two made eye contact. Shang Que immediately smiled proudly and said, \"As expected from our company's CTO. What a great idea.\"Yu Zhengdu: = =Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026Wait. When did I become the CTO?\"Shang Que lifted his chin. \"Now.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026Okay.\"Either way, there were only two living people in their company. No matter what t.i.tle he had, he'd be doing the same amount of work.But the two Daoists and Shang Que's att.i.tude made him realize that his casual recommendation wasn't completely impossible. Though he had intended it as a joke, after a serious discussion with everyone else, he felt that it was actually plausible to some degree.Yu Zhengdu normally enjoyed learning about innovative things, so had a vast knowledge regarding new technologies. In university, he had taken a cla.s.s on artificial intelligence in everyday household electronics. Thus, he knew the basics about how they worked. Consequently, after pondering a bit, he developed somewhat of a plan in his head.For example, to operationalize the underworld energy purifier, they could simply take the basic framework of a normal air purifier. There were two that came to mind immediately.One was a type of vacuum-and-purifying technology. It mainly involved putting an engine in the machine, along with a fan and filter. This would cause incessant air movement, forcing the air through the filter and vacuuming away the pollutants in it. Purification would then be achieved.The other type involved technology that took a more direct approach. The concept was different from the vacuum purifier. It didn't have the restrictions of a fan or filter, instead taking the initiative to release anti-pollutants into the air. These anti-pollutants would then spread until all pollutants in the air would get purified.Yu Zhengdu briefly explained his ideas to those present. Yuan Qing immediately understood, saying, \"Ey ey, I think the vacuum type is pretty good.\"Upon noticing everyone's attention on him, Yuan Qing hurriedly puffed out his chest. \"According to Yu ge's concept, the vacuum type only relies on the filter inside the machine. Actually, us Daoists also have a lot of magical instruments that can be used to remove evil. As long as we transform them a bit, place them inside the machine, then use the fan to allow air flow, underworld energy could easily be purified.\"\u2026\u2026He was already calling him Yu ge.It would be awkward for Yu Zhengdu to remind the other that he was probably younger than him. He could only nod and say, \"That's what I was thinking too.\"However, Yuan Qing's face was still filled with worry. \"This stuff is easy to talk about, but hard to actually make.\"This involved two special characteristics of Daoist instruments. For starters, magical instruments weren't as easy to produce as filters. To place them inside a machine, much development and design would need to be completed. Secondly, the reason Daoist magical instruments could remove evil was because they borrowed the natural energy of the universe and the power of ghosts and G.o.ds. This was the part that was hard to reproduce, because every time power needed to be borrowed, a Daoist priest had to hold a spell-casting ceremony to ask the G.o.ds for energy.Upon hearing this, Yu Zhengdu pondered a bit, then said, \"I'll try to write an initial program for it later. The goal is for the spell-casting to automatically happen when the user starts the program\u2026\u2026\"He couldn't help teasing the two Daoists again. \"For example, as soon as the app is opened, a recording of Daoist priest Mu personally reading the incantations will start playing\u2026\u2026\"Daoist priest Mu: \"\u2026\u2026\"While they were discussing the possibility of actually operationalizing the underworld energy purifier, Yang Xin had been silently drinking off to the side.As someone who had spent most of his life in the business field and was good at navigating treacherous gatherings, Yang Xin would normally be the focal point of such meetings. Especially since he was the host of today's lunch, he should've been the one guiding the conversation.But until they finished their meal, he didn't even manage to b.u.t.t in once.This really wasn't his fault. It was because the topics the others were discussing were too strange\u2026\u2026Wait that wasn't right. They were actually too scientific\u2026\u2026Ah, but that didn't seem right either\u2026\u2026Either way, they were just using too much jargon! He couldn't keep up at all!Yang Xin spent the entire time jumping between superst.i.tions and science. In the end, he could only stare wide-eyed as the little Daoist priest Yuan Qing, who had originally been solely dedicated to the Dao and was preparing to inherit Daoist priest Mu's legacy, excitedly pulled out his phone and signed up for an online cla.s.s about artificial intelligence in household technologies. He even used all possible tactics to get Yu Zhengdu to agree to develop it with him. More unbelievable yet, Daoist priest Mu completely agreed with this plan\u2026\u2026Yang Xin felt that in the short span of time this meal had lasted, he had gained a new view of the world.After getting back from Chuandong, Yu Zhengdu had a new task to work on\u2014\u2014developing the underworld energy purifier with Yuan Qing.But he wasn't planning on personally working on this project. Firstly, this wasn't the primary responsibility of their company. Whether or not he developed it was irrelevant in the long run and would only be considered an extra project. Secondly, he really didn't have the time. He and Zheng Yan had already discussed several times and finally agreed on an initial framework for the Life and Death Accounts program. Very soon, they would have to start its actual developmentHe thought about it and realized that they would have to hire two more professionals to be able to create the underworld energy purifier. Also, they would need more programmers to work on the Life and Death Accounts.But this time, they couldn't use Luofeng's name to hire people again. After all, the restrictions to Luofeng's hiring process were too plentiful. Disregarding the fact that not many people wanted to work with ghosts, their contract was a giant trap. It was a setback to the employees, but also for the company itself. In the off chance that they hired someone they didn't like, they wouldn't even be able to fire them.He and Shang Que discussed this, then finally decided to register a subsidiary company under Yu Zhengdu's name. The majority of business other than h.e.l.l specialized jobs would be moved to the subsidiary company. There would also be two versions of the contract; ghosts would sign with Luofeng, and mortals would sign with the subsidiary company.After reaching this agreement, Shang Que called Lu Lingxi over and told her to deal with the registration procedure.After hearing this, Lu Lingxi's expression was dazed. She asked Boss in confirmation, \"Register it under Yu Zhengdu's name?\"Shang Que looked at her, perplexed. He responded, \"Is there something wrong with that?\"Lu Lingxi: \"\u2026\u2026\"How could Boss sound so confident? Wasn't the problem very obvious?She had originally thought there was a big problem, but because of the way Boss asked the question, her tone immediately became less a.s.sured. She lowly asked, \"Zhengdu only signed a one-year contract with us. If he's the legal representative of our subsidiary company, what will we do next year?\"Shang Que replied as if it were obvious, \"Renew his contract ah.\"Lu Lingxi: \"\u2026\u2026\" Actually, she wanted to ask, how are you so confident he's definitely going to renew?Besides, even if he did agree to renew, why do you trust him enough to give the subsidiary company to him?Lu Lingxi had a bunch of questions, but under Boss's resolute gaze, she didn't manage to ask any of them out loud. She could only weakly answer, \"Got it. I'll go do that now.\"After leaving Shang Que's office, she still couldn't completely relax. Thus, she went to look for Yu Zhengdu for confirmation.Yu Zhengdu's response was much more reasonable. \"\u2026\u2026The question is, aside from me, is there any other living person in this company who can be the legal representative?\"Honestly speaking, if he had a choice, he didn't want to be the legal representative either. But the administrator of the subsidiary company needed to be a living person. This way, new employees' contracts would be contracts signed in the mortal realm with other mortals. There was no chance of rebound if one broke the contract. Right now, Luofeng only had two living employees\u2026\u2026 After much thought, Yu Zhengdu was still the only choice.Lu Lingxi actually really wanted to ask, then how come your dedication is so strong?But ultimately, she didn't dare to ask. She only rapidly finished the registration process and rented another office in the technology park to be the subsidiary company's headquarters. Then, she immediately started hiring people.Because many of the company's projects had started earning money, they didn't have as many restrictions regarding salaries anymore. Though they still couldn't offer insane prices like big companies, they could manage to hire a few qualified employees with ease.The opening of a subsidiary company progressed along swiftly and smoothly. Shang Que didn't just laze around either. It was obvious that their company was about to get bigger and stronger, so his days of gaming and managing a dozen or so ghosts were over. He very ambitiously\u2026\u2026registered for an online MBA cla.s.s. He started seriously learning modern knowledge regarding management, elegantly taking notes on his little notebook in front of his computer daily.He even learned how to make finance a.n.a.lysis reports!But before Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que could catch a break, Chen Siyu came knocking on their door again.Not long ago, Chen Siyu's dad had been hara.s.sed by an underworld spirit. In the end, Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que had helped him identify the person behind the scenes trying to harm him. They even won a duel against the other's demon priest and saved the materialist ghost Hao Wentao from servitude under him.Afterwards, with Hao Wentao's aid, Father Chen started retaliating against the person who was plotting against him, the stockholder and boss of Yao Chu, Liu Ningan. And because Liu Ningan's demon priest had lost the duel, he had no means of fighting back. In the past few months, he had suffered defeat after defeat. On the other hand, Father Chen had been extremely successful.Originally, the Chen family had thought everything was over. But unexpectedly, a heavily pregnant girl had shown up at their door two days ago. She claimed to be a mistress Liu Ningan kept outside, and cried and begged for Father Chen to save her no matter what.The entire Chen family was bewildered. They couldn't figure out what was going on. Why did Liu Ningan's mistress need them to save her?Originally, the Chen family hadn't planned on paying attention to her, but the girl refused to leave despite everything they did or said. After getting dragged away by the neighborhood security, she had shown up at Father Chen's company today, crying. The image of a pregnant woman wailing outside their company was a bad one, so Father Chen could only bring her back home again.But the girl refused to say what had happened to her. She only repeatedly told Father Chen everything was because his side had won the duel against Liu Ningan, forcing her onto this desperate path. No matter what, Father Chen needed to let her be.There was no way the Chen family could figure out what was going on. With no other choice, they could only try to calm the girl down first, then had Chen Siyu rush over to ask Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que to visit.Upon hearing everything, Yu Zhengdu was confused too. Yet, he remembered that the demon priest Liu Ningan had hired previously was very powerful, so it wasn't impossible he had saved a hand just in case. He didn't dare to overlook this situation, so got in Chen Siyu's car with Shang Que to make their way over to the Chen home.At the Chen home, there really was a young, pregnant woman sitting in the living room crying. Father Chen and Chen Sijie stood to the side, watching her. They looked like they didn't know what to do with themselves.As soon as he saw them enter, Father Chen immediately heaved a sigh of relief. He hurriedly rushed over and greeted, \"Mr. Shang, little Mr. Yu, you've finally arrived.\"The wailing girl saw that Father Chen was so respectful, so also looked up at the two of them. Her gaze was bewildered, as if she didn't understand why Father Chen would find two youths at a time like this.Yu Zhengdu greeted Father Chen, then walked around him to observe the girl.The girl was extremely young. At most, she was probably only around twenty. Her appearance was quite clean; her long and straight black hair rested by her pointy chin, framing her face so that it appeared even narrower. She was tall and thin. There was almost no meat on her arms or legs. Only her stomach was large and swollen, making it appear as if she was moments from labor.Yu Zhengdu strangely felt that there was something off about her stomach. It was as if there was a giant tumor growing on her waist. The proportions were all wrong.Father Chen introduced, \"This is Miss Gao Yun. She said she's a victim of the lost duel\u2026\u2026\"The girl named Gao Yun looked over. Her large eyes were swollen like walnuts. Her hands pushed against the sides of the sofa. She cried, \"Mr. Chen, why did you find these two people? What use do they have? Go find the religious master who won the duel instead.\"Father Chen was about to explain, only to see Shang Que casually glance at her and nonchalantly say, \"Spirit trapped in the belly.\"Gao Yun had originally meant to continue complaining, but upon hearing this, her eyes widened. Her hands resting against the sofa couldn't stop trembling. Her voice quaked as she asked, \"You, you\u2026\u2026how did you know?\"The Chen family didn't understand what he meant, but still could tell that Gao Yun's reaction was unnatural. Father Chen immediately panicked. \"What is that?\"Shang Que's gaze fell on Gao Yun's stomach. He lightly said, \"There is an infant's spirit trapped in her belly.\"The Chen family finally realized. Since Gao Yun had walked in their door till now, her hands had stayed by her sides; her stomach was so heavy, yet she hadn't held it even once.Actually used up my stockpile so translating real time here LOL Bear with meee the remaining 3 chapters will still be up within the next 12 hours I promise.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe spirit trapped in the belly was a kind of folk witchcraft. It had been extremely popular in certain parts of Huaxia back in the day, but because of how evil the magic was, most people who used it died tragic deaths. Thus, it slowly fell out of favor and disappeared.n.o.body had expected that there would be a \"belly spirit\" stuck inside Gao Yun's stomach.Except, though the thing in her stomach was called a 'spirit\", it was actually a ghost.Ultimately, this kind of witchcraft involved trapping an evil ghost inside a living person's belly. These ghosts were then called \"belly spirits\". They could predict the future and improve one's monetary luck; in purpose, they were similar to oracles.There were several ways of confining living spirits into other beings for prophetic purposes. One of the most common was the camphor-willow G.o.d, which involved carving camphor and willow bark into human shapes, then trapping a stolen child's spirit inside the figurine. However, sacrificing living beings and forcing them to tell the future was extremely cruel. Because of this, unless the creator was powerful, it was quite easy to get rebounded by the spell.In comparison to camphor-willow G.o.ds, the risks of keeping a belly spirit were even greater, because the ghost was literally trapped in a person's stomach. It meant that a living person had to be the vessel. If anything went wrong with the spell, the spirit could start causing trouble from inside the belly. Death was a big possibility.Very obviously, Gao Yun's stomach was Liu Ningan's \"vessel\" wherein he kept a belly spirit. And after the demon priest lost his duel, he no longer had the power to control the ghosts in his service. The belly spirit in Gao Yun's stomach had consequently started causing trouble.The three members of the Chen family had originally felt pity for Gao Yun, seeing as she was a pregnant woman who had been kicked out. But after hearing the cause of everything, they immediately backed away from her in fright and huddled behind Shang Que and Yu Zhengdu.Chen Sijie's entire face turned green as he thought of how he had been sitting right next to Gao Yun all this time. His voice trembled as he said, \"Big sister, you're too fierce. You dared to let Liu Ningan keep a ghost in your stomach?\"Yu Zhengdu was extremely speechless too. The atmosphere in modern-day society was too impetuous. Young people these days only wanted to make money fast; being a sugar baby was nothing, but selling one's own body to be the vessel of an evil ghost, that was a bit too much.Gao Yun was extremely regretful too, but it was too late now. She cried, \"Liu Ningan pro-promised me that nothing would happen. And besides, I know a lot of other girls who carry Buddhist cards and take care of k.u.man Thongs. I thought this would be\u2026\u2026would be about the same. And there was going to be a religious master doing everything. Liu Ningan told me that after keeping the belly spirit for four or five years, he would invite the belly spirit out\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\"Buddhist cards and k.u.man Thongs were popular ways of keeping little ghosts in Southeast Asia\u2026\u2026Ultimately, the goal was to earn a few quick bucks.He had nothing to say to people like these.\"It seems to me like Liu Ningan must've given you a lot of money.\" Chen Siyu obviously didn't like people like Gao Yun. She rolled her eyes and said, \"Since Liu Ningan promised you nothing would happen, why don't you go find him? What's the meaning of coming to us?\"Gao Yun covered her face and cried, \"After the master he hired lost the duel, he couldn't even take care of himself. My stomach got bigger and bigger. At first, Liu Ningan found some other masters to help me take a look, but none of them could come up with a solution. Liu Ningan was scared that I would become a burden, so he just, just\u2026\u2026just kicked me out.\"The Chen family: \"\u2026\u2026\"That sounded exactly like something Liu Ningan would do. And, his methods were vicious and cruel to an extreme. If Gao Yun had dared to cause a commotion with him like she was doing with the Chens, she probably would've been secretly gotten rid of by Liu Ningan.Gao Yun's entire body was quaking. \"I really have no other choice. I-I'm only twenty years old. I don't, I don't want to die yet\u2026\u2026\"Her features were delicate and her form was thin. As she cried, she looked extremely pitiful, arousing compa.s.sion in others. But as soon as everyone remembered that she had basically done this to herself, they couldn't find it in themselves to be understanding.Father Chen looked at Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que, expression complicated. He asked, \"Do you two have any way to fix this?\"Though Gao Yun had brought all of this upon herself, she was still a living, breathing person. Especially because this belly spirit sounded evil. If it wasn't taken care of, who knew if it would eventually harm others.Except they only saw Shang Que cross his arms over his chest and unsympathetically say, \"Yes. One corpse, two lives.\"Upon hearing this, Gao Yun's originally pale face became even more hopeless. She almost pa.s.sed out then and there.Yu Zhengdu was extremely surprised. After all, Shang Que had easily taken care of the Three G.o.ds, spirits that had received incense fire and offerings. Though this belly spirit was strange, it shouldn't be harder to deal with than the Three G.o.ds?Shang Que received his suspicious gaze and explained, \"She's pregnant.\"He expressionlessly glanced at Gao Yun and asked, \"Didn't the person who trapped the spirit in your belly tell you that you shouldn't get pregnant?\"Panic was clearly written over Gao Yun's face. She avoided eye contact as she muttered, \"They, they mentioned it\u2026\u2026but not in depth\u2026\u2026\"This was easy to understand too. Trapping a belly spirit was an extremely unorthodox spell. To lie and persuade a girl to trap a ghost in her stomach, one obviously wouldn't tell her the whole truth.Gao Yun's expression was both scared and regretful. \"At the beginning of this year, Liu Ningan got another sugar baby, so started visiting me a lot less\u2026\u2026My friend gave me an idea. She told me to get pregnant\u2026\u2026I've had this belly spirit for a little over three years, but normally don't look like I'm pregnant\u2026\u2026Nothing ever happened before, so I, so I didn't pay much attention to it\u2026\u2026\"Everyone: \"\u2026\u2026\" Wasn't this the cla.s.sic 'money over life'?Gao Yun shakily stood up and slowly walked towards Shang Que. \"What will happen if I'm p-pregnant?\"Shang Que took a step back in disdain. He coldly said, \"If you become pregnant, the belly spirit will possess the fetus' physical form and be born into the world as a ghost infant.\"The reason trapping a spirit in the belly was more dangerous than other spells was because, other than the fact that the \"vessel's\" life could be threatened by a rebound, the \"vessel\" absolutely could not get pregnant. Most belly spirits were actually vengeful ghosts kept under control by evil spells. As soon as they got the chance to retaliate, such as the vessel getting pregnant, they would do everything in their power to possess the fetus' physical body in an attempt to shrug off the control over them.Even if the demon priest hadn't lost his power and could still command the spirit, with a ghost inside, the fetus would be affected too. Once born, it would definitely be physically and mentally disabled.Once, someone with a spirit trapped in their belly had been overconfident in their abilities and stubbornly got pregnant. When the child was born, it had two mouths and was so rebellious it couldn't be taught.If Liu Ningan wanted to find a vessel for his belly spirit, a stupid and greedy person like Gao Yun was the best choice. But it was also people like her who were more likely to take risks and do dumb things.Now, the belly spirit had already successfully possessed the fetus; it was half a mortal. It wouldn't be so easy to remove it using the same methods as for removing ghosts. This was also why even though Liu Ningan had found so many religious masters, none of them could get rid of the belly spirit.Shang Que faced the same problem. If he only had to take care of a ghost spirit, he could easily overpower it. But the issue was, this belly spirit now had a physical form. He could kill ghosts, but it wouldn't be right for him to kill a mortal.Yu Zhengdu understood after hearing this. After all, Luofeng was officially registered with the Industry and Commerce Bureau of the mortal realm. Even the Ghost King needed to follow the laws of the living from time to time.Gao Yun had originally been shaky on her feet. Upon hearing Shang Que's words, her vision went black and she fell on her b.u.t.t.A pregnant woman with a large stomach falling down caused quite a commotion, and was a pretty tragic scene too. But the three members of the Chen family only stared at each other, none of them daring to be the one to help her up.In the end, Yu Zhengdu couldn't bear it and stepped forward to pull her up.Shang Que lifted his gaze, calmly saying, \"You don't need to aid her. The infant inside is much stronger than you. Nothing will happen because of a fall.\"Upon hearing this, Yu Zhengdu immediately dropped Gao Yun's hand and rapidly made his way back to Boss's side again. He dusted his hands off and said, \"I'm too used to helping grandmothers cross the street.\"Gao Yun: \"\u2026\u2026\"Gao Yun decided not to stand up. She sprawled on the floor and started throwing a tantrum. \"I'm begging you guys, save me, please save me\u2026\u2026\"Gao Yun was definitely the type to dare to keep a belly spirit and get pregnant at the same time. When she needed to, she could disregard her face and reputation completely. Everyone watched her; they could feel headaches forming already.Yu Zhengdu was quite exasperated too. He looked at Shang Que. \"There's really no other way?\"\"Well, there is.\" Shang Que wasn't moved by Gao Yun's actions at all. His hands remained crossed over his chest. His tone was cold as he said, \"But, you'll have to pay.\"The Chen family: \"\u2026\u2026\"Gao Yun froze too. When she finally realized what he had said, she hurriedly tried to crawl across the floor, but her stomach was too big, so it slammed against the ground, hard. \"I'll pay, as long as you can save me\u2014\u2014I'm willing to pay\u2014\u2014I'm begging you\u2014\u2014\"Following her movements, a few sounds of \"jiji\" could suddenly be heard in the room. It was slight, but mixed in with her overexaggerated wailing, was extremely obvious. The tone was a bit pleased and teasing, making it seem all the more noticeable.\"Jiji\u2014\u2014\"\"Hu\u2014\u2014It hurts a lot\u2014\u2014\"Gao Yun immediately stopped moving. She stared at her own stomach in terror. \"It's the belly spirit, the belly spirit\u2026\u2026The belly spirit is talking\u2026\u2026\"Only to see her the swollen skin of her abdomen slightly tremble. The sound of \"jiji\" was coming from inside.\"Jiji\u2014\u2014\"\"Jiji\u2014\u2014\"\"Mom\u2014\u2014It hurt me a lot when you hit me against the floor\u2014\u2014\"It was the high-pitched voice of a little girl. She dragged out the last syllable of her words chillingly. The voice sounded from inside the stomach, so was a bit m.u.f.fled, making it much scarier.Gao Yun's face paled. She lost strength in her limbs and sprawled out on the floor, staring at her stomach in horror and screaming, \"I'm not\u2014\u2014I'm not your mom\u2014\u2014\"This was the first time the Chen family had met a stomach that knew how to speak. They were suddenly so scared they clung onto each other and trembled. Chen Sijie shouted, \"Big sister, can you hurry up and leave. We're not the ones who did this to you, go find Liu Ningan ah\u2014\u2014\"Gao Yun's lips quaked. She couldn't even talk.Yu Zhengdu clung onto Boss's shoulders, cowering as he shouted across the room at the belly spirit, \"Wow, little belly spirit. So you're a little girl ah\u2014\u2014\"After hearing this, everyone else became speechless. Was now the time to be making jokes?Only to hear a childish voice respond from Gao Yun's stomach, \"That's right. I'm a very cute little girl\u2014\u2014\"Everyone: \"\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu was stunned too. He had only reflexively teased the child because of its cute voice. He had been prepared to push Boss in front of him in case the belly spirit got angry. He never expected for the belly spirit to actually answer him.He thought for a bit, then used a bargaining tone of voice to ask, \"Really? Then can you come out so we can see?Everyone else: \u2190_\u2190This was\u2026\u2026truly\u00b7lying to children.\"No. Don't think I don't know, as soon as I come out, you guys are going to catch me!\" What a pity. Though the belly spirit was young, it seemed that she already had a lot of experience. She hrmph'd and said, \"And this lady. She trapped me for over three years. I'm going to kill her!\"Her voice was filled with boundless hate. It made chills run down the listeners' spines. Chen Sijie cried, \"Wuwu, my biggest fear is of child ghosts\u2026\u2026\"Only Yu Zhengdu's voice was filled with compa.s.sion. He continued to ask, \"How did they trap you inside?\"As soon as the topic was brought up, the little girl's voice immediately became sharper. \"Jiji\u2014\u2014They stole me from my mother's stomach, then grinded my skull into powder and poured it into a wooden figurine. It hurt so much\u2014\u2014so much\u2014\u2014jiji\u2014\u2014\"Everyone's scalps tingled upon hearing the little girl's description of the events that had happened. Only Shang Que seemed like he wasn't surprised at all. He lightly explained to Yu Zhengdu, \"That's a way of stealing living spirits. The crueler the process, the stronger the ghost spirit will be.\"The supposed stealing of living spirits referred to the selection of intelligent boys and girls for live organ mutilation to remove their living energy. Throughout the procedure, the infant had to remain breathing. Hearing the belly spirit's story made everyone s.h.i.+ver. She had even been directly taken out of her mother's womb, so her vengeance was impossibly strong. No wonder none of the religious masters could come up with a solution.Perhaps because she remembered her painful past, the little girl's voice became much harsher. She slammed against Gao Yun's stomach with a sound of \"pengpeng\". She yelled, \"I'm going to find them for revenge\u2014\u2014I want to take revenge\u2014\u2014\"They saw a tiny handprint appear on Gao Yun's stomach. Once, twice, the palm became clearer and clearer, as if it could break through the skin at any moment.A vein appeared on Gao Yun's forehead. Her lips became grey as she sweated profusely. She panted and wailed, \"So painful\u2014\u2014so painful\u2014\u2014My stomach is about to explode\u2014\u2014\"At the same time, a strong gust of cold wind blew into the room. All the electronics automatically turned on. The lights flickered, turning on and off sporadically; the TV's volume suddenly increased rapidly. Everyone was shocked.The Chen family trembled. Chen Sijie shouted, \"Aaaah, we're all innocent\u2014\u2014\"The little girl screeched, \"I'm going to kill all of you\u2014\u2014\"Following her words, a loud \"peng\" sounded from Gao Yun's stomach. The child's palm pushed forward, causing the skin of the belly to rise almost five centimeters. The shape of the hand was clear as day.Gao Yun screamed in pain, then finally couldn't stand it anymore and fainted.The three members of the Chen family were already on the verge of a mental breakdown. Chen Siyu shoved her brother forward. \"Aaah\u2014\u2014hurry and take her outside\u2014\u2014\"Chen Sijie clung onto his older sister's arm and refused to let go. \"I won't, I'm scared\u2014\u2014\"At the same time, Shang Que also raised a hand.But before he could do anything, Yu Zhengdu lunged forward and reached a palm out to high-five the little hand inside Gao Yun's belly. He gently said, \"Little belly spirit, calm down first. We're good people.\"Shang Que: \"\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu looked back at him. He used his other hand to make a 'sh\" gesture, then mouthed, \"Let me try\u2014\u2014\"After a pause, he still couldn't completely relax, thus mouthed again, \"Keep an eye out. Protect me\u2014\u2014\"Shang Que froze. His hand that was still in the air slowly changed into an \"ok\" gesture.Only to see the little palm that had previously been repeatedly slapping against the belly suddenly stop. It remained pressed against Yu Zhengdu's hand. The little girl's voice was somewhat confused, \"Who are you?\"\"We're not bad people.\" Yu Zhengdu gently explained, \"I even tried to help you up earlier, did you forget?\"The fingers on the little hand twitched. She seemed conflicted, \"I remember\u2014\u2014\"Yu Zhengdu saw that she finally calmed down a bit, so simply sat down beside Gao Yun and pointed at the three members of the Chen family. He said, \"Little belly spirit, look at them. They're all Liu Ningan's enemies. They're just like you, wanting to take revenge on Liu Ningan.\"The Chen family: \"\u2026\u2026\" They nodded in sync.The belly spirit said, \"Ah, that's true. I calculated it. They're Liu Ningan's victims.\"Yu Zhengdu nodded. \"Exactly. So you believe me now, right.\"The belly spirit's voice suddenly wasn't so harsh. \"Okay.\"A while later, the belly spirit added, \"Then you guys wait until I get born. We can go get revenge on Liu Ningan together.\"Yu Zhengdu's expression instantly became disdainful. He said, \"Are you sure you want to get born?\"The belly spirit hrmph'd. \"I'll be stronger if I get born!\"Yu Zhengdu very seriously stated, \"You need to think this through. Right now you're possessing the body of Liu Ningan's child. If you are born, you'll have to call Liu Ningan Dad.\"The palm that had originally been pressed against Gao Yun's stomach immediately disappeared. The little girl wailed loudly, \"No, I don't want to be his kid\u2014\u2014\"The Chen family: \"\u2026\u2026\"Shang Que: \"\u2026\u2026\"The author has something to say:Shang Que: As soon as a belly spirit successfully possesses a body, it's impossible to get them to come out.Zhengdu: Little belly spirit, think it through!Belly spirit: I'll be out immediately!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter getting reminded by Yu Zhengdu, the belly spirit finally realized that if she were to be born from Gao Yun's stomach, she would be Liu Ningan's child. Her originally agitated demeanor immediately wilted. She started crying through the abdomen, \"Liu Ningan is a bad person. I don't want to call him Dad.\"Yu Zhengdu sighed and shook his head. \"Isn't that right. Liu Ningan's just an old b.a.s.t.a.r.d. If you're born, before you can even get your revenge, you'll have to be the b.a.s.t.a.r.d's son first. That's not worth it at all.\"The belly spirit agreed. She angrily said, \"I don't want to call that lady Mom either. She's so shallow!\"Everyone: \"\u2026\u2026\" That's not what you just said.Yu Zhengdu slapped his thigh and concurred. \"Exactly. Moms like her aren't good moms.\"The belly spirit cried for a long time, then pitifully expressed, \"Then I don't want to be born by her.\"Shang Que who witnessed everything from the side: \"\u2026\u2026\"It wasn't easy for belly spirits to get the chance for possession. In the past, as long as a belly spirit successfully possessed a physical body, they would refuse to leave the fetus even if it meant certain death. Half ghost, half mortal infants held a strength that normal Underworld spirits couldn't compare to. Becoming a ghost-infant was practically every belly spirit's ultimate dream.This was his first time witnessing a belly spirit willingly agreeing to not be born\u2026\u2026Did all programmers have such strong logical reasoning?The Chen family didn't know how difficult it was for a belly spirit to give up the chance of becoming a ghost-infant. Thus, they weren't that shocked.For them, it was the scene of Yu Zhengdu sitting criss-crossed on the floor, calmly chatting with a belly spirit through a woman's stomach that was more astonis.h.i.+ng.Was this the basic quality that an employee at a high-tech evil removal company had to possess?Yu Zhengdu finally heaved a sigh of relief after seeing that the belly spirit was convinced. He said, \"Since you've agreed, hurry and come out. We can go find Liu Ningan for revenge together.\"The belly spirit wailed a bit more through the skin of Gao Yun's stomach before finally whimpering, \"I, I don't know how to get out\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\"Everyone else: \"\u2026\u2026\"It seemed like this belly spirit still hadn't learned all her skills yet.Yu Zhengdu looked to Shang Que for help. Shang Que silently raised his hand and casually made a gesture. He chanted, \"Ghost spirit hear my command, come before me.\"As long as the belly spirit agreed to stop possessing the fetus, it would take no effort at all for him to summon her.Following the last of his voice, a gust of cold wind blew through the room.Yu Zhengdu saw a chilly, black shadow emerge out of Gao Yun's stomach and land in front of Shang Que. After it stopped moving, it slowly started taking shape.It was a five or six year old little girl. Her black hair was draped behind her ears; her eyes were round and bright. She truly was quite adorable. The only offputting bit was, her eyes were completely black and didn't contain the light that living people's did.Yu Zhengdu went \"wa\" and held out a thumbs up. \"You really are super cute.\"The members of the Chen family weren't Luofeng's employees, thus couldn't see the belly spirit's appearance with their naked eyes. Upon hearing Yu Zhengdu's words, they huddled together once again. Father Chen's expression was pained as he asked, \"Did the little, little belly spirit come out?\"\"Yeah.\" Yu Zhengdu dusted his hands off and stood up. Then, he furrowed his brows. \"Little belly spirit, don't you have any clothes to wear?\"The little girl twiddled her fingers and angrily tattled, \"Those evil people never burned any clothes for me.\"\"They are too stingy. It's a good thing they didn't become your mom and dad\u2026\u2026\" Yu Zhengdu scolded a bit before looking up at the Chen family. He asked, \"Um, can I ask you guys to go buy some children's clothes made of paper\u2026\u2026\"Chen Siyu immediately nodded. \"Of course, of course. I'll leave right now.\"\"Buy a few extra sets of little dresses.\" Yu Zhengdu thought about it some more, then added, \"And some toys made from paper.\"Chen Sijie was eager too, so raised his hand as well. \"I can do that!\"Upon hearing this, the belly spirit lifted her head and gazed up at Yu Zhengdu with her round eyes. \"Gege, I also want an iPad.\"Her dark eyes were filled with antic.i.p.ation, just like a normal child's would be. \"That lady spent all her time watching idol dramas. I want to watch Peppa Pig!\"Thus, Yu Zhengdu looked at the Chen siblings once more. \"The little belly spirit also wants an iPad\u2026\u2026\"Chen Sijie was a bit conflicted. \"\u2026\u2026I don't think anybody makes those.\"As soon as he said this, he felt the temperature in the room drop. He was so scared he almost screeched.At this critical moment, Father Chen stepped up and said with the confidence of a successful businessman, \"No worries. We'll give them money. They can make it on the spot.\"When Gao Yun woke up, she discovered that she was lying on the Chen family's couch. There was no one around her.At first, she was dazed. Then, she finally remembered what had happened before she had pa.s.sed out. In an instant, her entire being was overtaken by the fear of being bothered by the belly spirit once more. Coincidentally, the smell of incense and burning paper floated past her nose at this time. After, she heard the sound of Yu Zhengdu and the others outside:\"Oh oh oh, this outfit is pretty. She really likes it.\" This was Yu Zhengdu's voice.\"Of course. I found the design online and had the master make it on the spot\u2026\u2026You don't say, the master's craftsmans.h.i.+p is really great.\" Chen Siyu's terror had pa.s.sed. After seeing how happily Yu Zhengdu was interacting with the belly spirit, she gathered her wits and asked, \"Ey, can you use that ghost imaging technology? I want to see how the little belly spirit looks in it.\"Yu Zhengdu asked what the belly spirit thought, then took out his Underworld phone and opened the camera for Chen Siyu to see. In the screen, a little girl held onto the corners of her dress and spun around in a circle. She sweetly said, \"Thank you jiejie.\"Chen Siyu immediately squealed and put her hands on her own face. \"Ah\u2014\u2014Too cute!\"Father Chen glanced in the phone screen too, then hurriedly pulled out his trophy. \"The iPad is here. This year's newest model, with an extra large 1024GB of storage.\"Yu Zhengdu was shocked. \"Do they have ones with such big storage?\"Father Chen puffed out his chest proudly. \"They do if you ask them to make it on the spot.\"Yu Zhengdu gave him a thumbs up. \"Impressive!\"Gao Yun didn't know what was going on. She struggled to get up and walked outside with her heavy stomach. Only to see Yu Zhengdu, Shang Que, and the three members of the Chen family gathered in a circle in the garden\u2026\u2026burning paper?Gao Yun asked them, stunned, \"You\u2026\u2026What are you guys doing?\"They all turned back to glance at her. Yu Zhengdu smiled and said, \"We're burning some stuff for the little belly spirit.\"As he spoke, his expression became contemptuous. \"You guys were really so stingy. You trapped the little belly spirit for so many years and made her prophesize for you guys, but didn't even burn her a single outfit. No wonder she wants to kill you all.\"The little belly spirit was wearing a pretty new dress. She stood beside Yu Zhengdu and angrily stomped her foot as she nodded. \"Exactly. This auntie only knew to buy buy buy for herself every day. She would buy over twenty sets of clothes and a dozen purses every month, which is why she was so scared Liu Ningan wouldn't want her anymore.\"Gao Yun had pa.s.sed out right after the belly spirit had started slapping her stomach, so she didn't know any of what had happened afterwards. Now, her face was that of someone extremely stunned. It took a while for her to react. She muttered, \"The belly spirit\u2026\u2026what happened to the belly spirit?\"Upon seeing how out of it she was, Father Chen decided to be the better person. He sighed, \"Miss Gao, the belly spirit has already left your stomach. From now on, she won't bother you anymore. You can relax.\"\"Really?\" Gao Yun suddenly widened her eyes. Almost reflexively, she reached out to feel her abdomen. Though she didn't have any psychic powers, she could still very clearly feel that the fetus in her stomach was different from before. Obviously, Father Chan had been telling the truth. She practically burst into tears of joy as she panted while clinging onto her stomach. \"That's good, that's good\u2026\u2026\"Shang Que glanced at her and lightly said, \"You should hurry and get rid of the fetus in your stomach now. Unborn spirits won't enter mortal forms that have shared a life with Underworld spirits. If you give birth, it will be a stillborn.\"Gao Yun had originally had everything planned out, but in the end, she had only harmed others and herself. She blankly held onto her abdomen and stood there for a bit, before finally saying, \"I'll go to the hospital tomorrow.\"Shang Que didn't actually care what she was thinking. After telling her this, he expressionlessly held out his phone and pulled up the payment code. \"We've solved your problem. Pay up.\"The Chen family: \"\u2026\u2026\"This Mr. Shang truly didn't make exceptions for the young or old. His money-loving image was as stable as could be.Gao Yun's emotions were on a roller coaster ride. Before she had fully recovered, a payment code had already appeared in front of her face as soon as she looked up. After looking at the fee Shang Que had entered, her expression immediately froze. She suddenly screamed, \"That's too expensive!\"Upon hearing this, the belly spirit who had just received an iPad spat. She angrily exposed, \"She normally spends way more than that on purses.\"The Shang Que right now was only an emotionless cash register. His expression didn't change as he simply stated, \"Pay.\"Gao Yun: \"\u2026\u2026\"Actually, she would've been fine with this amount in the past. But now, she had been kicked out by Liu Ningan, so no longer had a source of income. Before she would be able to find her next sugar daddy, she was looking at a period of only spending without earning anything. She was used to making lavish purchases, so was a bit unwilling to save. She hesitated for a bit, then said, \"I\u2026\u2026I don't have that much money.\"The belly spirit exposed her on the spot once again. \"She does.\" Then, she accurately relayed the amount in Gao Yun's savings account.Yu Zhengdu nodded after hearing this, then stared straight at Gao Yun. He repeated what the belly spirit had just said, then smiled. \"Miss Gao, we apologize about this, but we're only a small business. We don't allow for bargaining.\"The Chen family: \"\u2026\u2026\" Small business my a.s.s. Your price range is already way higher than the top temples in the nation.Gao Yun was bewildered after hearing him report the amount in her bank account, accurate to the decimal point. \"How did you know my savings amount?\"Yu Zhengdu said, \"The little belly spirit told me.\"Gao Yun's face immediately paled. \"Belly spirit? The belly spirit is still here?\"\"Of course.\" Yu Zhengdu casually dropped a handful of incense ash on the concrete. \"Little belly spirit, here. Do a dance for auntie.\"After speaking, they saw a small trail of footprints appear in the thin layer of ash. Yu Zhengdu clapped and praised, \"This doll and teddy bear dance is really good!\"When he turned back around to look at Gao Yun, her legs had already started shaking. She only managed to keep from falling by clinging onto the fence.Yu Zhengdu slightly smiled. \"So Miss Gao, when do you plan on paying the fee?\"Actually, if this were normally, Yu Zhengdu definitely wouldn't act this way. But Gao Yun's actions had crossed a line. She was truly willing to do anything for money; disregarding the fact that she had sold her own body, she was even trying to avoid paying them in a situation like this.People like her didn't deserve pity or understanding.The more she valued money, the more important it was for her to remember the cost of her love of riches.Gao Yun's body couldn't stop shaking. She didn't dare to bargain anymore, hurriedly pulling out her phone and scanning the code to transfer the appropriate amount.The emotionless cash register Shang Que couldn't help glancing at Yu Zhengdu out of the corner of his eye. As expected, only mortals could understand other mortals.The three members of the Chen family who had witnessed everything from the side couldn't help but feel a deep fear and respect. This company's debt collection techniques were really too terrifying!And also, weren't these two a little too in sync when asking for money!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter receiving Gao Yun's money, Father Chen told the family's personal driver to send her home. Yu Zhengdu and them finally sat down to discuss how to deal with the belly spirit and Liu Ningan.After everyone heard the belly spirit detail what had happened during her service to Liu Ningan and the demon priest, they finally realized that those two evil men did far more than capture wandering spirits and illegally earn money. They had also secretly done several extremely harmful deeds, such as going against the Heavens and killing others.For example, the belly spirit's biological mother had been covertly kidnapped by Liu Ningan and died after her abdomen had been cut open.And the belly spirit had only been a fetus back then. She had been taken out of her mom's womb, alive, at the calculated time. After suffering through the pain of having her living spirit collected, the infant's spirit had been refined and provided for. Thus, she had kept growing like a regular child would've, all the way until the age of five. Then, the crown of her skull had been ground into powder and trapped in a willow box by the demon priest until this day.There was another problem with this situation. The belly spirit had been sacrificed by the demon priest, so was a direct subordinate of the demon priest. The contract between mortals and ghosts belonged to the Heavens and earth. Even the Underworld couldn't forcefully break it.Because of this, though the belly spirit had managed to get stronger and wanted to extract revenge while the demon priest was weak after losing the duel, she actually couldn't do anything until she could regain possession of her own skull. Before then, she was still under the control of the demon priest and wouldn't be able to enter samsara.Yu Zhengdu watched the little belly spirit excitedly play with her new iPad. As soon as he thought of how cruelly she had been captured by Liu Ningan before she had even been born, then trapped inside a willow box and Gao Yun's stomach for over five years, his heart twinged with pain.He looked at Shang Que and bargained, \"How about, we come up with a way to get the little belly spirit's skull back?\"Shang Que had seen several ghost spirits before. Many of them suffered tragic consequences. To him, the belly spirit's experiences couldn't be considered that terrible at all, but it had been Yu Zhengdu who had spoken up, so he didn't say anything. He only nodded, \"Okay.\"Yu Zhengdu immediately became more alert. He rubbed his hands in antic.i.p.ation and declared, \"Then let's do it.\"Shang Que: \"Un.\"Yu Zhengdu looked at him. He looked at Yu Zhengdu. A moment later, Yu Zhengdu asked in confusion, \"Boss, um\u2026\u2026what should we do?\"Shang Que paused for a second. \"Wait.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\uff1f\"Shang Que held his hands out in exasperation. \"To get the crown of her skull back, we have to first find the demon priest. But he's a mortal\u2026\u2026\"Shang Que didn't explicitly state anything, but Yu Zhengdu already understood. There were differences between the dead and the living. Though Boss had a lot of power, he still couldn't directly locate a living person.The Chen family only got a gist of what they were saying from off to the side; they were also extremely compa.s.sionate towards the belly spirit. Chen Siyu was a bit worried after hearing their conversation. \"Is it that you can't come up with a way to help the little belly spirit?\"Shang Que wasn't worried at all. He only said, \"When the demon priest opens the altar to cast spells, I will be able to find him\u2026\u2026\"\"How long would that take!\" Yu Zhengdu looked at Chen Siyu. \"Would it be convenient for you to lend me a computer? I'll hack into Liu Ningan's security cameras at home and in his company building to take a look\u2026\u2026\"Shang Que: \"\u2026\u2026\"He almost forgot. Though the Underworld couldn't control the people of the mortal realm, their company still had a programmer from the mortal realm. The type who had really great abilities\u2026\u2026Chen Siyu was dazed too. She looked at Yu Zhengdu in shock. \"You know how to hack?\"\"What kind of question is that?\" Yu Zhengdu was extremely confused by her reaction. \"Our company deals with the Internet ah. High tech things are more trustworthy.\"Chen Siyu: \"\u2026\u2026\"She just found out that Luofeng was actually a company dealing with the Internet?Chen Siyu gave her own laptop to Yu Zhengdu, bewildered. Only to see him grab the computer and rapidly start typing on the keyboard while getting some basic information about Liu Ningan from the Chen family. His actions were resolute and familiar, and he instantly managed to open a few pages that n.o.body else could understand.The Chen family: \"\u2026\u2026\"He was really a programmer?!These days, the requirements for being an evil remover were already so high?The corner of Shang Que's mouth twitched in a slight smile upon seeing everyone's shocked gazes. His tone was quite pleased as he said, \"He's our company's CTO.\"The Chen family: \"\u2026\u2026\"Luofeng\u2026\u2026a 'small start-up\" company whose main direction of focus was a mystery\u2026\u2026The code for the security program wasn't too complicated. Only a short while later, the computer screen was filled with security footage. The little belly spirit's attention turned onto this after finis.h.i.+ng two episodes of Peppa Pig. She leaned over and pointed at a few scenes on the screen, then said, \"Aiya, here. I've been there before. That bad person went there too.\u2026\u2026\"\"The demon priest went there too?\" Yu Zhengdu suddenly became alert. He turned to look at her. \"Then do you know where he casts his spells?\"The little belly spirit fiddled with her fingers and hesitated a bit, then stated unconfidently, \"I think, I think\u2026\u2026\"Before she could finish speaking, her eyes suddenly rolled back until only whites remained. Her entire body started furiously shaking. The iPad fell onto the ground because she couldn't hold onto it anymore. Yu Zhengdu was shocked. \"Little belly spirit, what's wrong with you?\"The belly spirit's features were twisted. She held onto her head and screamed sharply, \"Jiji\u2014\u2014jiji\u2014\u2014it hurts so much\u2014\u2014\"\"He's calling me\u2014\u2014\" The belly spirit tilted her head back and yelled, \"Jiji\u2014\u2014He's gotten stronger. I'm in so much pain\u2014\u2014\"\"How is that possible?\" Yu Zhengdu hurriedly put a hand out to hold onto the belly spirit's arm. But as soon as he was about to touch her, he only felt air. He watched as the belly spirit's form faded away, then disappeared.Yu Zhengdu looked at Shang Que in panic, only to see Shang Que shake his head. \"The demon priest used the crown of her skull as the medium for his spell to summon her back. If I forcefully kept her here, he would know that she's already left his control. Maybe by the time we made it over, he would've destroyed her skull. That way, she would never be able to enter samsara again.\"Yu Zhengdu felt his heart tighten. Shang Que gently placated, \"Don't worry. Since he's casting spells now, I can find him.\"Yu Zhengdu finally relaxed a bit. But at the same time, he was quite perplexed, \"Didn't the demon priest get hurt? How come he's suddenly opening the altar to cast spells?\"At this moment, Father Chen's phone started ringing.\"It's the driver.\" Father Chen picked up, but not even two sentences in, his expression had already changed. He looked at everyone else, conflicted. \"Gao Yun got taken away by Liu Ningan's people.\"As soon as he finished saying this, everyone turned around in sync to look at him. Father Chen relayed what the driver had told him. Apparently, almost as soon as Gao Yun had left the Chen family, she had immediately called Liu Ningan from in the car. She told him that the belly spirit inside her stomach had been taken away, so wanted Liu Ningan to take her back in. n.o.body knew what Liu Ningan told her, but shortly after, his people had stopped the Chen family's car in the middle of the road and taken Gao Yun away.Though the driver didn't know what had happened with Gao Yun, he did know that the Chen family and Liu Ningan were on opposite sides, so hurriedly called Father Chen.The Chen siblings really had nothing else to say. Chen Siyu was especially in disbelief. \"How can there be someone as stupid as Gao Yun? She still dares to return to Liu Ningan's side?\"Father Chen sighed and shook his head. \"People die for money; birds die for food.\"Yu Zhengdu was contemplative. \"It seems like the demon priest already knows that the belly spirit has left Gao Yun's stomach. Is that why he summoned her back?\"Shang Que nodded. \"Most likely. If the belly spirit was still possessing the fetus, the demon priest wouldn't be able to do anything to her no matter how high his cultivation level was. But now that she's left the fetus, she's still under his control.\"Chen Siyu couldn't help but cuss, \"That woman is both stupid and evil!\"Yu Zhengdu still maintained his calm demeanor. He waved his hands around and said, \"The most important thing now is to hurry and find the demon priest to rescue the little belly spirit.\"Shang Que said, \"He's somewhere in the southeast direction. We'll have to keep looking for a more specific location\u2026\u2026\"\"I found him.\" Yu Zhengdu suddenly turned the laptop around so that the screen was facing everyone. They all leaned down to look, only to see Gao Yun being dragged down a corridor by two large men. Her face was filled with fear as she struggled to no avail.Shang Que: \"\u2026\u2026\" The battle between magic and technology. Today, technology won once again.Because the issue was related to ghost-saving and duels, Yu Zhengdu didn't let the Chen family tag along. After getting a more specific location, only he and Shang Que made their way over.The Liu mansion: hidden room.This was quite a large room. The walls were covered in runes drawn on with cinnabar; all four corners of the room contained banners used for summoning ghosts. The banners swayed, though there was no wind. It made the whole room appear even eerier.A sacrificial altar had been placed in the middle of the room. It was unique from normal sacrificial altars in that the offerings placed on it were raw meat and animal organs still dripping blood. There was even a small pot of thick blood too, from which emanated the sharp scent of iron. Mixed in with the aroma of incense and burning paper, it aroused horror in people's hearts.A small wooden figurine the size of an adult's hand stood on the offering table. The figurine was covered in runes drawn on with cinnabar too.A middle-aged priest with a third eye drawn on his forehead with cinnabar held a copper bell and was in the middle of pacing in front of the sacrificial altar, eyes closed as he read incantations. With every step he took, the temperature in the room seemed to drop some more.\"From the ends of the Heavens, to the bounds of the Earth, I seek lost souls, come before my altar\u2026\u2026Hurry and do as I command.\"After who knew how many circles, the Daoist finally finished his chant. He shook the copper bell in his hand once. Though the room was completely closed off, a gust of cold wind suddenly blew in, causing the banners in the corners to wave crazily.The Daoist opened his eyes and saw the little girl who had appeared in front of the table. His smile was pleased as he said, \"Little belly spirit, you're finally back. I missed you to death.\"At the same time, a man's overjoyed voice sounded out from the corner. \"Daoist priest Jin, have we succeeded?\"Only to see a small bed similar to those used in hospitals located in a different corner of the room. A pregnant woman with a stomach larger than normal rested on it. Her limbs had been kept in place with tape so that she couldn't move. Her s.h.i.+rt was raised over her abdomen, revealing a stomach that looked like it was about to erupt at any moment.Gao Yun's eyes were wide. Tears and sweat kept flowing down her face. She trembled incessantly, but her mouth was taped shut so she couldn't say anything.A fat, middle-aged man stood beside her. He seemed to have gone several days without rest. His face was dark and his eyebags and skin sagged. There was a third eye drawn on with cinnabar on his forehead too. If another religious master were present, they would've been able to tell that this was a YinYang eye, capable of seeing into other realms. His own two eyes were filled with greed as he stared at the little girl who had appeared by the altar in excitement. His voice was hoa.r.s.e, \"With her, we will be able to rise once more.\"Daoist priest Jin refused to make such boastful comments, but the pleased expression on his face was hard to hide. \"We're still missing the final piece. Once we take the fetus out from Gao Yun's stomach, we can seal the belly spirit into the infant's body and refine her into a ghost-infant. Once she is under my control, I will become undefeatable\u2026\u2026\"It seemed like he could already see his glorious future. His gaze was cold as it fell on the little belly spirit. \"I just never imagined that she would willingly leave the fetus after successfully possessing it. I wonder where the Chen family found their religious master. They didn't even break her spirit into pieces, but just as well for me. They are really stupid to an extreme\u2026\u2026\"The fat man was Liu Ningan. He stared at the little girl before the altar, then at Gao Yun's swollen stomach. He laughed creepily, \"This dumb woman wasn't completely useless after all. I thought I was going to die because of her, but who knew that she would be able to provide a ghost-infant for us.\"Daoist priest Jin had told him a long time ago that in the ranks of ghost spirits, half mortal, half ghost ghost-infants were the most powerful, but there were also a lot of risks a.s.sociated with them. As soon as a ghost spirit possessed the fetus inside the pregnant woman, it would definitely do everything in its power to exact revenge. But who would've expected that they would be able to meet a belly spirit that was willing to leave the fetus after successfully possessing it.Weren't the Heavens on his side?He eagerly rolled up his sleeves and pulled out a newly sharpened scalpel from under the bed. He gazed darkly at Gao Yun and said, \"Don't worry. I cut open her biological mother too, so I'm very experienced. I won't let you be in pain for long\u2026\u2026\"Sacrificing ghost spirits was directly related to his future financial luck. Liu Ningan always personally partic.i.p.ated, never letting anyone else do the deed for him.The little belly spirit had just been summoned back and hadn't regained consciousness yet. Her head hung lowly as she stood in front of the altar, not reacting to her surroundings at all. But Gao Yun had already realized something from where she was tied onto the bed. She shook like a leaf, gaze desperate as she kicked her legs, trying to escape. But even after she had used all of her strength, she didn't manage to loosen her bonds one bit.The sharp and cold blade landed on Gao Yun's stomach, creating a thin line of blood. Gao Yun's nerves were on edge. She stopped breathing for an instant, then her eyes rolled back and she pa.s.sed out.Liu Ningan scoffed. \"It's better that she's pa.s.sed out. Otherwise, she might affect my performance.\"He tightened his grip and was just about to thrust the blade down, when a large \"peng\" sounded. The door to the secret room, previously covered in runes, got aggressively kicked open. It crashed against the walls on both sides.Two long and thin shadows emerged from outside, backlit.Yu Zhengdu rested his hands on his hips and yelled, \"Demon priest, evil merchant. You're under arrest. Hurry and squat facing the wall while holding your heads!\"Liu Ningan was first dazed before squinting and asking, \"Who are you? How did you get in?\"He had placed a lot of importance on this spell-casting ceremony. There were several bodyguards stationed all around.\"The bodyguards can't stop them.\" Daoist priest Jin was unbothered. He laughed coldly, \"You must be the religious masters the Chens hired. You truly have some skills.\"Yu Zhengdu raised his head and puffed out his chest. \"It's good that you know. Quickly! Surrendering will half your punishment.\"As soon as Liu Ningan heard that they were on the Chen family's side, enmity appeared in his gaze. \"So it was you guys.\"\"You're here just in time!\" Daoist priest Jin roared with laughter. \"I was originally planning on personally finding you guys for revenge, but you've come here yourselves, saving me quite a bit of trouble.\"He shook the copper bell in his hand and pointed upwards. \"Do you still think I'm the me of the past? Hurry and look. What is that.\"Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que raised their heads to look. With this, they finally realized that on the ceiling of the room, an abundance of runes had been drawn on with cinnabar. The ceiling was square and the runes covered every inch of it. At first glance, it seemed like an enormous magical seal.But the pattern on this magical seal\u2026\u2026seemed a bit familiar.Daoist priest Jin's laughter became even more unrestrained. \"I wondered why the Chen family suddenly got so strong, so hired someone to secretly investigate. Who knew that I would find a jade stone with a seal on it from the Chen's daughter. What a pity that they're all idiots. None of them knew how valuable this seal really was. But then again, that isn't their fault. Today, probably not many recognize this seal. And even if they did, they wouldn't be able to use the true power of the magical seal like I can\u2026\u2026\"As he spoke, he observed Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que's expressions, trying to identify terror on their faces. But even after his entire spiel, the two of them still didn't react at all. It seemed like they weren't feeling any emotions.Daoist priest Jin felt a surge of anger in his heart. His tone was threatening, \"Unknowledgeable youths, do you know what this is?\"Yu Zhengdu nodded. \"The Ghost King of Luofeng Mountain's seal.\"Daoist priest Jin: \"\u2026\u2026\"Daoist priest Jin had to swallow the explanation about to come out of his mouth. He asked in a daze, \"How did you know?\"The Ghost King of Luofeng Mountain's seal had long since vanished from the mortal realm. Even the masters of large temples only recognized the Fengdu Ghost Summoning seal that was based on the Ghost King's seal. Daoist priest Jin himself had only coincidentally heard of someone mentioning the magical seal before. He had always thought it was a rumor, but thankfully his cultivation level was quite high. After getting his hands on Chen Siyu's jade, he managed to recognize the uniqueness of the seal.Even so, he had still spent quite a bit of time duplicating the seal, and also practiced meticulously before being able to slightly borrow some of the power of the ghosts of Luofeng Mountain. But just this was enough for him to overpower the rest of the Daoists.The youth before him couldn't be that old. Besides, he was dressed like a homebody. How could he recognize this seal?But Yu Zhengdu completely ignored him. He was in the middle of staring at Shang Que, speechless. \"Boss, so the reason he suddenly got so strong, is because of you?\"\"It wasn't me, I didn't do anything,\" Shang Que furiously denied. \"He's lying!\"The author has something to say:Daoist priest Jin: Ghost King of Luofeng Mountain, please lend me some power!Shang Que: No. Get out.Daoist priest Jin: ????????And that's the last of the bonus chapters! Back to one chapter a week as I recover and build up my stockpile again LOLPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayDaoist priest Jin had originally been proud and confident; he had even already prepared himself for Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que's pitiful crying and begging.But things didn't seem to be developing how he thought they would\u2026\u2026It was okay that those two weren't scared at all, but how could they be whispering to each other like n.o.body else was present!Daoist priest Jin's breath got stuck in his chest. It couldn't go up or down, so he almost choked to death. He thought about it and realized that these two youths probably only recognized the magic seal, but didn't know the power the seal held, just like the Chen family's daughter. She had been in possession of a treasure, but had only treated it like a normal amulet.This was the supposed 'unknowledgeable people don't know fear'. It was the exact phrase needed to describe such hotheaded youth.Because of the Chen family's retaliation, Liu Ningan's life hadn't been going so well lately. He was on the verge of going bankrupt in terms of business, so already hated the people the Chen family had hired since long ago. Now that he knew it was these two youth, though he was surprised, he still felt unwavering hatred in his heart.Just like Daoist priest Jin, he greatly antic.i.p.ated seeing them kneeling on the floor and crying. But he didn't expect for them to deviate from the script. Thus, he immediately became furious, scoffing, \"The younger generation these days are truly arrogant to an extreme, not crying until you see the coffin. Daoist priest Jin, you should let them realize what it means for there to be people outside of people and a sky outside of a sky.\"His thoughts matched Daoist priest Jin's perfectly. Thus, the other smiled at Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que smugly. He held the copper bell in one hand and strolled a few steps closer to them before stopping. He said, \"Seeing as you're young, you probably haven't witnessed anything truly magnificent. Today I will do a favor for you and show you the power of the magical seal belonging to the Ghost King of Luofeng Mountain. You won't have pa.s.sed through the mortal realm in vain\u2026\u2026\"He held the copper bell up high and rhythmically shook it in a few circles. The bell very clearly made \"ding ding ding ding\" noises, echoing loudly and piercing into the listeners' hearts. At the same time, Daoist priest Jin's other hand picked up a brush from the incense table and started writing the invitation on a piece of yellow paper with cinnabar.Yu Zhengdu couldn't help glancing at Shang Que. He said very understandingly, \"I think what you said before was absolutely right. These Daoists need to complete so many steps to cast a spell. In that time, I could've beat him up twice.\"Shang Que expressed his agreement. \"They should get beaten up for falling behind the times.\"As they spoke, a cold gust of wind suddenly blew into the room. The spirit-inviting banners started flapping again.Liu Ningan's expression was filled with unadulterated joy. He cackled at Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que. \"You two don't have Yin Yang Eyes, right. What a pity; otherwise, you might've been able to see the rare scene of an Underworld army.\"Previously, Daoist priest Jin had practiced borrowing the power of the ghosts of Luofeng Mountain once while he was watching. Liu Ningan had personally seen him summon hundreds of Underworld spirits and line them up into a squadron. They had all been under his control.That scene had been something even Liu Ningan, who had witnessed plenty in his life, had never seen before. In all of Fu City, who would dare to make enemies with him, someone who could control hundreds of ghosts? It was the equivalent of having an Underworld army.The more Liu Ningan thought about it, the smugger he became. His voice was a bit hoa.r.s.e as he said, \"You two. If you kneel now and beg for mercy, I can consider letting you off easy and allowing you to keep your spirits intact after death\u2026\u2026\"The yellow paper on the incense table flapped in the wind. Daoist priest Jin had already finished writing the invitation. He bent his knees and knelt on the ground, paying his respects. He shouted, \"Disciple is a Daoist from Mang Mountain, named Jin Heguan. I sincerely pay my respects to our Lord, the Ghost King of Luofeng Mountain. I beg the Great King to lend the power of the ghosts to disciple. Disciple will surely serve the Great King faithfully. I am at the Great King's service\u2014\u2014\"Liu Ningan's eyes were wide as he reflexively took a step back in preparation for the crowd of ghosts about to arrive. At the same time, he didn't forget to look at Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que, a cruel smile on his face. \"Hope you're mentally prepared so you don't p.i.s.s yourselves\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu silently glanced at Shang Que. \"Great King, what do you think?\"The Great King crossed his arms over his chest and stated expressionlessly, \"Not bad.\"As soon as he finished speaking, the cold wind came to an abrupt stop. The banners naturally stopped waving, and the talismans also stopped moving.It was as if a balloon about to burst had suddenly been poked open and the air stuck inside had rapidly escaped.The entire room was silent, as if nothing had ever happened.Daoist priest Jin: \"\u2026\u2026?\"Liu Ningan: \"\u2026\u2026?\"Daoist priest Jin raised his head in a daze. He discovered that no ghosts had appeared in the room. His bewilderment could be clearly seen in his eyes.Liu Ningan was extremely confused too. He hurriedly asked, \"Daoist priest, what's wrong? Where are the Underworld soldiers?\"Daoist priest Jin had no idea either. He thought to himself, could it be that my spell failed? But he had clearly very strictly followed each step; there was no way he could've made a mistake. Sweat started appearing on his forehead. He shook the copper bell again and shouted, \"Please, our Lord, Ghost King of Luofeng Mountain. Gift your disciple with the power of the ghosts. A little is enough\u2014\u2014a little is enough\u2014\u2014\"His voice almost cracked with how loud he was yelling, but still nothing changed in the room.Their surroundings were completely silent. Forget a hundred ghosts, not even an Underworld spirit that he could normally summon when opening the altar appeared.There were only Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que's unimpressed faces.Daoist priest Jin: \"\u2026\u2026\"The scene could be considered very awkward.Liu Ningan had prepared for so long to receive the Underworld soldiers, so refused to accept this turnout. He kept asking, \"Daoist priest, where are the ghosts? Where are they?\"Daoist priest Jin felt a slight panic rise in his chest, but maintained his calm countenance nonetheless. He swept a hand over his forehead. \"Our Lord the Ghost King is probably napping right now, so hasn't heard my request. When the Ghost King awakens, he will naturally lend me the power of the ghosts\u2026\u2026\"Liu Ningan: \"\u2026\u2026\"Honestly speaking, if he hadn't personally witnessed Daoist priest Jin borrow a group of ghosts before, he would be wondering if he had hired a scammer.Daoist priest Jin lost face but refused to lose his aura. He imposingly lifted his head and roared, \"You two, if you're brave, don't run away. Just wait a few minutes more. I'll definitely be able to invite some ghosts to deal with you.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\"Shang Que had only patiently waited to see if he could come up with anything new after realizing that Daoist priest Jin was planning on using his own power. But after all this time, the other was still using the same methods as the mortal Daoists of the past. Because of this, he lost his patience and coldly stated, \"There's no need to wait.\"Before Daoist priest Jin could react, he saw Shang Que glance at Yu Zhengdu and say, \"You show him what the right way to summon ghosts is.\"Yu Zhengdu solemnly nodded, then pulled out his phone and opened WeChat. He left a voice message, saying, \"Kang Jin, Boss and I are preparing to have a group fight with a demon priest right now. Hurry and bring the brothers over. Call a few extra ones as soon as possible. I'll send you a location.\"Daoist priest Jin, Liu Ningan: \"\u2026\u2026????\"Shang Que's face was also filled with disbelief, but Yu Zhengdu didn't realize at all. He put his hands on his hips and proudly stated, \"Hrmph. Let the demon priest experience the ghost summoning technology of the age of the Internet.\"Shang Que slowly sighed, then expressionlessly stated, \"I meant for you to summon a ghost with the heart seal\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu went ah, then turned to look at Boss. \"You should've told me that earlier\u2026\u2026\" It's not like he didn't know how the two of them were never on the same wavelength!Shang Que: \"\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu had been the one who had taken the initiative to learn the heart seal back then, and had even successfully borrowed a ghost. How come his thought process was so strange at times like these?Daoist priest Jin watched as the two youths chatted for a while, then pull out a phone to call someone on WeChat. He immediately felt like he had been lied to. His face was dark as he said, \"You guys really don't know anything.\"Liu Ningan's face was twisted too. \"You think this is a group fight on the streets? Even calling people over. Be wary; perhaps none of you will survive to return\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu waved his hands. \"No, not people. I was calling ghosts just now.\"Liu Ningan became enraged, \"You dare to joke with me\u2014\u2014\"He lost control of his temper, holding up the scalpel in his hand and charging forward.Upon seeing this, Daoist Jin hurriedly shouted, \"Boss Liu, how come you're personally acting? The ghosts I've invited will be here soon\u2026\u2026\"Liu Ningan's temperament didn't allow for him to wait. The fat on his face was shaking, \"They'll have to die either way. It doesn't matter who kills them.\"Though he was large and heavy now, he had worked his way up from the bottom when he was young. In a real fight, he was strong and used unjust tactics. The knife smoothly stabbed directly towards Yu Zhengdu's abdomen.\"Go die\u2014\u2014\" Liu Ningan's face was twisted, a bloodthirsty smile tugging at his lips.\"Ao person dared to cause you trouble? Watch us eat him!\"Another one rolled up his sleeves and said, \"We were scared that there weren't enough ghosts at the company, so I called for some outside help too. We've never lost a group fight.\"Daoist priest Jin: \"\u2026\u2026???\"Liu Ningan: \"\u2026\u2026???\"Yu Zhengdu glanced at Kang Jin and said, \"You guys took your sweet time.\"Kang Jin shrugged innocently. \"If you wanted us to be fast, you should've summoned us with the heart seal. But you called us through WeChat, so we could only drive over.\"A coworker popped his head out from behind and added, \"Yeah. It was a good thing you burned us a few cars previously, otherwise we would've had to take the bus over. That would've been even slower.\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\" Could these ghosts not be so non-intimidating when speaking!Liu Ningan was already completely lost. He pointed at Yu Zhengdu with a trembling finger, \"You guys\u2026\u2026you guys\u2026\u2026\"He quaked in placed for a long time, unable to say a complete phrase in the end.Daoist priest Jin was also shocked out of his mind, but he had ultimately seen more ghosts in his lifetime, so managed to maintain a calm image. He asked, \"These are the ghosts you summoned?\"Yu Zhengdu: \"Yeah.\"Daoist priest Jin felt the blood boiling in his chest. \"Through the phone?\"Yu Zhengdu: \"Yeah.\"Daoist priest Jin: \"Pu\u2014\u2014\" A mouthful of old blood got spat out.He had worked so hard to learn the ways of the Dao for so many years, always strictly following the steps for each spell-casting ceremony. He had once been extremely pleased with his talent. In the entire Huaxia area, how many Daoists were better than him?He had never imagined\u2026\u2026the Daoist ways he had practiced with such pride would be defeated so easily in the face of modern technology.Daoist priest Jin trembled as he held up the copper bell. He made his last struggle, \"So what if you can summon ghosts? Can these spirits defeat the Ghost King of Luofeng Mountain? Wait as I cast a spell and ask to borrow the power of Luofeng Mountain\u2026\u2026\"Before he could finish speaking, he saw all the ghosts Yu Zhengdu had called over stare at him like he was stupid.Kang Jin turned to ask Yu Zhengdu, face full of confusion, \"What does this demon priest mean? He wants to borrow Boss's power?\"Yu Zhengdu: \"\u2026\u2026\" Ey, it was a long story.Daoist priest Jin had originally thought something was off. Now that he heard their conversation, he finally realized what it was. He looked at Shang Que in disbelief. \"You-you-you, could it be, you are\u2026\u2026\"Yu Zhengdu tsk'd. His tone was mocking, \"When you needed to borrow power you called him 'our Lord the Ghost King', but now that you've met him in person, you don't even recognize him. What a fake master-disciple relations.h.i.+p.\"Shang Que hurriedly shook his hands. \"He's no disciple of mine.\"The author has something to say:Demon priest: (putong) Is my kneeling posture accurate?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37 - Plans for the Next LifePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 37 - Plans for the Next LifeThough Daoist priest Jin already had a suspicion in his heart, he was still in disbelief after hearing the other personally admit it. He felt all the strength leave his body as he dropped the copper bell on the ground. The sound of metal hitting the concrete floor was piercing.\u201cIm-imk2026;k2026;impossible?\u201d Daoist priest Jin\u2019s eyes widened as he stared at the devastatingly handsome youth before him. He struggled to get out, \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026\u2026you\u2019re lying. How could the Ghost King of Luofeng Mountain\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHow could he lend you power,\u201d Shang Que responded, chin slightly raised as he looked down coldly at the other.There were an innumerous amount of Daoists in the world, and an even larger number of spells. But at the center of it all, these spells involved asking G.o.ds, ghosts, or the energy of the three realms for power. This was normally a pa.s.sive skill, because as long as your cultivation level was high enough and you wors.h.i.+pped the being wholeheartedly, it was entirely possible to naturally borrow power through spells.Unless you were like Daoist priest Jin and had been directly rejected by the person you were wors.h.i.+pping.Technically speaking, Daoist priest Jin was pretty unlucky too. There were hundreds upon hundreds of magical seals that the Daoists knew of; among them, the famous ones included the Treasure Seal of Master Daojin, Achievement Seal of Yangping Capital City, Fengdu Ghost Summoning Seal, North Pole Ghost Killing Seal, and more. These had all been spread far and wide in the mortal realm, used incessantly by all Daoists. But coincidentally, Daoist priest Jin\u2019s cultivation level was high enough that he managed to recognize the long-lost Luofeng Mountain Ghost King\u2019s Magical Seal, which was the original form of the Fengdu Ghost Summoning Seal. How could he stop himself from trying to borrow the power of the ghosts of Luofeng Mountain?Daoist priest Jin was still trying to defend himself. At this time, the sound of Liu Ningan\u2019s trembling voice reached his ears. \u201cDaoist priest Jin, look\u2026\u2026look ah \u2026\u2026\u201dIt turned out that Liu Ningan had collapsed out of shock due to the sudden turn of events. As he fell on the ground, he happened to lean backwards, managing to get a view of the situation above them.Daoist priest Jin followed his gaze and looked upwards, only to see that the magical seal drawn on the ceiling in cinnabar was fading rapidly, until it completely disappeared.\u201cThere are no more G.o.ds. All ghosts in the Underworld and mortal realm belong to me\u2026\u2026\u201d Shang Que\u2019s voice was empty, as if he were speaking from a far away void. \u201cFrom today onwards, none under my control shall lend power to you.\u201dDaoist priest Jin had been able to stir trouble for several years without consequence. This was because of his above average talents and skills. But, this was also the reason that he could immediately feel his cultivation promptly leaving him.\u201cIm\u2014\u2014impossible\u2014\u2014\u201d Daoist priest Jin\u2019s expression shattered. He quivered as he picked up the copper bell that had fallen on the ground and furiously shook it a few times. He made a few hand gestures, continuously chanting, but nothing happened. He couldn\u2019t even feel a little bit of energy within himself.\u201cHow could it be\u2026\u2026how could it be?\u201d Daoist priest Jin sprawled on the floor, defeated. He looked at Shang Que in disbelief. \u201cLuofeng Mountain\u2026\u2026Luofeng Mountain sank into the earth over a thousand years ago\u2026\u2026The Ghost King of Luofeng Mountain already\u2026\u2026already\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou know quite a bit,\u201d Shang Que said lightly as he glanced down through half-open lids. \u201cBut not enough.\u201dThe cinnabar on the ceiling had already completely dissipated, revealing the grey rock underneath. The hidden room was dark and eerie, filled with the Underworld spirits Yu Zhengdu had summoned. Everyone gathered in a circle, trapping Liu Ningan and Daoist priest Jin side. The coworker whose eyes were permanently tired took out his eyes and held them up to Liu Ningan. \u201cLet me see. Who is so brave that they dare to publicly provoke our boss!\u201dLiu Ningan was so scared of the two eyeb.a.l.l.s that had suddenly appeared in front of him that he started screaming, \u201cSave me\u2014\u2014Don\u2019t come over\u2014\u2014\u201dKang Jin and them were normally bound to the rules of the Underworld and were thus rarely allowed to scare mortals. This was a rare opportunity, so they were extremely excited. The whole group surrounded Liu Ningan, teasing him until he was on the verge of a mental breakdown. Only then did they finally reluctantly turn to look at Shang Que and ask, \u201cBoss, what should we do with him? Eat him alive? Or kill him and then eat him?\u201dLiu Ningan\u2019s voice was already hoa.r.s.e from how much he had screeched. It sounded like someone was slaughtering a pig. \u201cDon\u2019t kill me\u2014\u2014don\u2019t kill me\u2014\u2014\u201dShang Que turned to look at Yu Zhengdu. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201dKang Jin scratched his head. \u201cWhy are you asking Yu ge? He doesn\u2019t eat people\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cCan you respect a lawful society?\u201d Yu Zhengdu questioned in disdain. \u201cCall the cops.\u201dKang Jin immediately felt disappointed. \u201cOkay\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do it, I\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ll call the cops.\u201d Liu Ningan who had long-since lost his sanity completely disregarded the fact that they were in a room filled with evidence of his crimes. He rushed to reach for his phone, pulling it out and hurriedly dialling the number for the police station.Yu Zhengdu: \u201ck2026;k2026;\u201d\u2026\u2026Liu Ningan had never thought that he would antic.i.p.ate the arrival of the cops so much. As soon as the police walked through the door, he reacted like he had seen an angel descending from Heaven. He pitifully charged over and clung onto the civil servant\u2019s thigh, tears streaming down his face. \u201cYou\u2019re finally here. I\u2019ve finally waited until you arrivedk2014;k2014;\u201dUncle police officer yanked his leg out, expression bewildered. He asked, \u201cWho called the cops?\u201d\u201cIt was me, me.\u201d Liu Ningan refused to admit defeat and clung onto him again. He raised his hand up to answer, like an elementary school student would. \u201cPlease take me away. I\u2019m begging you\u2014\u2014\u201dUncle police officer: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMortals couldn\u2019t see the room full of ghosts. Other than Liu Ningan, the police could only see a Daoist off to the side, expression blank, a pregnant woman tied onto a bed, and two youths.\u201cOfficer, h.e.l.lo.\u201d Yu Zhengdu had given up on Boss being social. He naturally stepped forward to greet the police officers, then gave a simple explanation for the current situation. He spent a majority of his time relaying Liu Ningan and Daoist priest Jin\u2019s crimes.There was no way to explain the fact that Liu Ningan had trapped ghosts. The mortal law didn\u2019t cover these situations either. Thus, Yu Zhengdu could only place an emphasis on the fact that Liu Ningan had kidnapped and murdered people before. Coincidentally, Gao Yun regained consciousness at this time too. As soon as she saw the police, she immediately started crying and began revealing everything Liu Ningan had done.It had to be said that since she had been with Liu Ningan for so many years, she really did have a lot of dirt on the other.The police officers probably hadn\u2019t expected for the situation to unfold in this manner. They almost didn\u2019t manage to react in time.The leader of the squadron\u2019s last name was Pan. He was the one whose thigh was being hugged by Liu Ningan. He had actually had his eye on Liu Ningan for several years already. The way the other had suddenly gotten rich was suspicious, and the occurrences related to him in the past few years were sketchy too. But the strange thing was, no matter how carefully they investigated, all clues would mysteriously disappear before they could find substantial evidence. They couldn\u2019t manage to relate anything to Liu Ningan at all.He never could\u2019ve imagined that the reason he would finally be able to catch Liu Ningan would be because the other had called the cops himself. And under the circ.u.mstances where there was still a large room full of material evidence and witnesses remaining.Captain Pain stared at the way the previously arrogant Liu Ningan was clinging onto his thigh, refusing to let go. He was bewildered for a moment.Daoist priest Jin was still dazed. When he got pulled to his feet by the police, he finally managed to regain some sense. He pointed at Shang Que and shouted, \u201cHe\u2019s the Ghost King. Hurry and get a religious master to exorcise him. He\u2019s the infamous Ghost King of Luofeng Mountain\u2014\u2014\u201dThe police officer: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dCaptain Pan furrowed his brows and looked at Shang Que in confusion.At this time, Yu Zhengdu pulled out two business cards and handed them over. He said, \u201cI\u2019m an employee of Luofeng Life Management and Consulting Ltd. Co., Yu Zhengdu. This is our boss.\u201dHe politely smiled. \u201cWe are an officially registered company that has a file at the Industry and Commerce Bureau. If Officer has anything to ask, you\u2019re welcome to come visit our company whenever needed.\u201dCaptain Pan scanned the business cards. One read CTO Yu Zhengdu while the other read CEO Shang Que. They truly looked very formal. He nodded, then turned around to yell at Daoist priest Jin, \u201cWatch it! Acting so mysterious.\u201dDaoist priest Jin: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe Ghost King of Luofeng Mountain\u2026\u2026owned a business in the mortal realm????Daoist priest Jin refused to accept this. He pointed at Shang Que and cried, \u201cHe\u2026\u2026he really is a ghost. He\u2019s a ghost\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que completely ignored him, calmly taking out a little plastic square instead. He handed it to Captain Pan and said, \u201cThis is my ID card.\u201dDaoist priest Jin: \u201c Kekekekeke \u2014\u2014\u201dWho the f.u.c.k would\u2019ve thought! The Ghost King of Luofeng Mountain even had an ID card!!!!!!He was both mentally and physically fatigued, to the point that blood appeared at the corners of his mouth. He wanted to continue explaining, but didn\u2019t know what to say.Captain Pan tsk\u2019d. \u201cIt appears that Liu Ningan really has done too many evil things. He even dared to invite such an obvious scammer into his home.\u201dYu Zhengdu sincerely agreed. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right. He\u2019s so superst.i.tious that he\u2019s lost his mind.\u201dThe ghosts all around them: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u2026\u2026Due to the fact that Yu Zhengdu explained how he and Shang Que coincidentally had business with Gao Yun, then coincidentally encountered Gao Yun being kidnapped, resulting in their selfless attempt to save her \u2013 this, along with the witness statements provided by the Chen family, allowed the two of them to leave the police station after recording a testimonial each.As for Liu Ningan, there was substantial evidence of his kidnappings. With Gao Yun\u2019s help, the police even managed to uncover evidence regarding several other crimes where Liu Ningan had killed for money. He had no way out anymore. Even his company couldn\u2019t escape the fate of being forced shut.The company he owned, Yaochu Stocks, had already been on a downward descent these past few days. It had long since been weathering a storm, on the brink of collapse. This was also a contribution to the reason he had taken a risk and wanted to sacrifice a ghost infant. After Liu Ningan\u2019s arrest, Yaochu Stocks received the brunt of the Chen family and several other companies\u2019 revenge. Not even a few days later, it completely fell apart.Daoist priest Jin had been his most loyal accomplice, so naturally couldn\u2019t avoid jail time either. But as opposed to prison time, what hurt him more was the fact that his cultivation had completely dissipated and he would henceforth be unable to borrow power again. Those Underworld spirits that he had forced into servitude and tortured in the past all returned now with a vengeance. They visited his dreams night after night, causing him extreme mental anguish, but he was unable to do anything about it.However, Gao Yun\u2019s fate was the one that caused everyone to sigh the most. That day, she had been overly stimulated, which forced her into early labor. After she got taken to the hospital, they performed a C-section, only to find that the fetus was already dead. What was most terrifying, though, was that the dead fetus had four eyes. This scared the medical staff so much that they almost all fainted. n.o.body knew the reason, so concluded that it was because Liu Ningan had sinned too much and that this was karma on his part\u2014\u2014of course, this explanation wasn\u2019t entirely wrong either.Later on, because Gao Yun had maintained a close relations.h.i.+p with Liu Ningan but failed to report his crimes to the police, and also because she was a possible accomplice, Gao Yun was arrested too.***After successfully solving the situation with Liu Ningan, Father Chen very courteously paid Luofeng Management another large sum of money. Though Yu Zhengdu felt that he didn\u2019t need to pay anymore since Gao Yun had already paid, the Chen family were adamant.Father Chen very directly relayed that because of their help, his business had been going along exceptionally smoothly lately. Also, they had completely removed the threat of Liu Ningan, which deserved another payment.\u2026\u2026As for the mental trauma of witnessing Luofeng\u2019s money collection strategies, well, they kept that hidden in their hearts. There was no need to say it out loud.After Daoist priest Jin and Liu Ningan were arrested by the police, Yu Zhengdu successfully managed to find the willow figurine containing the little belly spirit\u2019s skull. Now that Daoist priest Jin\u2019s cultivation had all but disappeared and he was suffering from rebound, his contract with the belly spirit had naturally ended too. The skull could no longer pose a threat to the belly spirit, but Yu Zhengdu still specially asked Daoist priest Mu and little Daoist Yuan Qing from Qinglian Temple to perform a blessing for her.After regaining her freedom, the belly spirit should have been able to re-enter samsara and begin a new life, in theory. But soon, Yu Zhengdu discovered a new problem.Since historic times, very few ghost spirits could break free from their bonds without performing any evil deeds. The Life and Death Accounts\u2019 algorithm for calculating this was thus very messy. For example, though the little belly spirit was in the record, the algorithm couldn\u2019t immediately come up with a precise reincarnation time or reincarnation result for her. It needed human maintenance and intervention.But what could be predicted was the fact that it was very likely the belly spirit wouldn\u2019t be able to reincarnate as a human in the next life.Here, it would be necessary to bring up how outdated the Underworld laws were. Those like the belly spirit, though victims in their own right, had ultimately hurt the innocent. The laws didn\u2019t care that she had been unwilling and forced by Daoist priest Jin during a long period of enslavement. And the biggest difference between the mortal realm and Underworld was that there were no policies in place protecting minors. Child ghostly offenders were treated the same as adult ghostly offenders. Even Shang Que could only try to lessen her punishment; in the end, though, everything was still decided entirely by the Heavens.Fortunately, as the main culprits, Daoist priest Jin and Liu Ningan would be heavily punished after death. The belly spirit could only be considered an accomplice, unwilling at that, so would receive a much lighter sentence. And after being rescued, she had been temporarily placed under the supervision of all Luofeng employees. Everyone especially liked this adorable little girl and were extremely kind to her, even naming her. In this way, they made sure that her ghostly life before reincarnation wasn\u2019t completely tragic.Thus, for a long time afterwards, everyone could see Yu Zhengdu counseling the little belly spirit.Yu Zhengdu: \u201cPeppa, all ghosts and spirits will ultimately have to reincarnate. You understand, right?\u201dBecause she was obsessed with cartoons, the belly spirit had ultimately chosen the name Peppa after deliberating between Nana, Zi Han, Xin Yu, and several other popular names.Peppa nodded. \u201c Un. \u201dYu Zhengdu stroked her head. \u201cUncle Kang Jin should\u2019ve told you already. Not all ghosts can reincarnate into humans. But actually, there really isn\u2019t much of a difference. Either way, you\u2019ll still be alive. The most important thing is to live happily, isn\u2019t that right?\u201dPeppa tilted her head and thought about it, then nodded again. \u201cYes.\u201d Actually in her case, her memories as a human hadn\u2019t been happy at all. All her memories of being a human consisted of being stolen from her mother\u2019s womb and tortured; they were only filled with pain and suffering.Yu Zhengdu subtly sighed in relief. He held her little hands and solemnly promised, \u201cPeppa, if you happen to\u2026\u2026I say happen to, okay. If you happen to reincarnate into an animal, don\u2019t be scared. We\u2019ve already made preparations. No matter what animal you reincarnate as, we will bring you back as soon as possible and let you live a happy life.\u201dPeppa nodded, not really understanding. \u201cGege, I trust you.\u201dShe thought about it, then asked, \u201cIf I become an animal, can I still watch Peppa Pig?\u201dYu Zhengdu furiously nodded. \u201cOf course. And PAW Patrol and Boonie Bears. You can watch everything. And your little dresses. We\u2019ll continue buying them for you.\u201dPeppa blinked and smiled sweetly. \u201cThen I\u2019m not scared of anything anymore.\u201dKang Jin felt teary-eyed after witnessing everything. \u201cAh, I seem to see a kind father\u2019s glow emanating from Yu ge.\u201dShang Que happened to be pa.s.sing by. Upon hearing this, he paused and turned to ask Kang Jin, \u201cWhat about me?\u201dKang Jin: \u201c\u2026\u2026???\u201dWhat kind of question was Boss asking?He failed to correctly decipher the Ghost King\u2019s internal thoughts in that moment and could only try to deduce a superior\u2019s mindset from a subordinate\u2019s role. A brief pause later, he tentatively opened his mouth, \u201cThe glow of best boss of 2018 is emanating from your body!\u201dShang Que: \u201c\u2026\u2026Dock your wages ba .\u201dKang Jin: \u201c!!!!!\u201dWhy?!!!The author has something to say:Shang Que: This employee is no good. Make him a chicken in the next life.Kang Jin: No\u2014\u2014 ( Er Kang hand )Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In the time she spent waiting, she was pa.s.sed around to be taken care of by Luofeng\u2019s ghostly employees one by one,The little girl had been forced into servitude before she had even been born, so had never received any formal education. Regardless of her personality or moral character, she seemed a bit strange at times. Fortunately, she was good at heart, so listened carefully to the lessons everyone taught her.Yu Zhengdu consequently downloaded and printed copies of the Elementary Student\u2019s Guidelines and the Code of Conduct for Red Scarves for her to learn. He also told everyone to teach her to do kind things when she was under their care; for example, helping old grandmother ghosts cross the street, returning lost sacrificial offerings to the lost and found at each reincarnation point, maintaining a safe distance from unlucky humans, especially pregnant women, to prevent from worsening their luck, and more. He also often signed her up for Underworld children\u2019s athletic compet.i.tions and similar events. Other than helping her formulate a normal worldview and good moral character, he naturally also hoped that she would be able to become friendlier and kinder. This way, it might help her reincarnation results.After finally wrapping up everything with the belly spirit, Shang Que was notified of another issue a few days later.Work had just barely started on that day. Lu Lingxi walked in reluctantly to see Shang Que and said, \u201cBoss, a company called Big Eye Livestream called and said they want to invite you to attend an event.\u201dShang Que was in the middle of elegantly listening to cla.s.s. Upon hearing her, he looked up in bewilderment. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201dLu Lingxi felt too ashamed to keep explaining. Thus, she simply handed over her phone, open to a web page, for Shang Que to take a look at. Shang Que glanced at it and immediately went: \u201ck2026;k2026;\u201dThe page Lu Lingxi had opened was a post from a famous gossip forum. The post\u2019s t.i.tle was extremely excited: Hurry and get in here to understand what a G.o.d-given appearance is!!!!!!!!!The original post was short and to the point. \u201cI\u2019ve already grown tired of saying those three words, but this time I\u2019m definitely going to shout it out loudly: Okay with this!!!!!!!!!!\u201dBeneath the text, several of Shang Que\u2019s pictures were attached.It turned out that a lot of people had sneakily taken pictures of Shang Que when he had attended Yu Zhengdu\u2019s graduation ceremony and posted them online. Thus, because of his uniquely handsome appearance, he somehow managed to become slightly famous. This was also taking into consideration the fact that Hou Guangzong\u2019s speech at the graduation ceremony had attracted a lot of attention. If not for that, then the amount of conversation around Shang Que probably would be greater.Even so, Shang Que still managed to garner a large group of wild fans without his own knowledge.After the graduation ceremony, he and Yu Zhengdu had both been extremely busy, left with practically no time to check up with news online. Shang Que\u2019s fame was also only in a specific, small circle. Consequently, neither of them had realized until today.And this company named Big Eye Livestream was preparing for their celebratory first anniversary activity. They had come up with a large number of topics, one of which was called \u201cPalpitating Youth\u201d; they were specifically looking for good-looking non-celebrities somewhat famous online to attend in addition to popular idols as guests. This plan had been quite well received.Though Shang Que was only slightly famous and not considered a true Internet celebrity yet, his physical appearance was truly too astonis.h.i.+ng. The scout for the planning team had unintentionally come across his picture on the forum and immediately recognized his potential. After a lot of effort, he finally managed to get the other\u2019s contact information to invite him to attend.After figuring out the sequence of events, Shang Que looked up at Lu Lingxi and asked, \u201cPalpitating Youth?\u201dLu Lingxi didn\u2019t even dare to meet Boss\u2019s gaze. She kept her head lowered. \u201cThey think your appearance is very youthful\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que very coldly and emotionlessly rejected, \u201cNot going.\u201dLu Lingxi had only been customarily asking. She wasn\u2019t surprised by his response at all, so simply made a noise of acknowledgment before handing over two reports. \u201cThese detail the financial situation of our company from the past two months. Please take a look.\u201dShang Que nodded, then signalled for her to leave the reports. He continued listening to his lecture.After Lu Lingxi left the office, Shang Que finally elegantly took out his earphones, leaned in closer to his computer, switched tabs, then started looking for the post that Lu Lingxi had just shown him.t.i.tle: Hurry and get in here to understand what a G.o.d-given appearance is!!!!!!!!!Main floor: I\u2019ve already grown tired of saying those three words, but this time I\u2019m definitely going to shout it out loudly: Okay with this!!!!!!!!!! [picture] [picture] [picture] [picture] [picture] [picture]Floor 1: f.u.c.k, when I saw the t.i.tle, I clicked in to gift the floor owner a chicken cage, but now I\u2019m going to lock myself inside too.Floor 2: !!!!!! Since the floor owner is okay with this, I am too!Floor 3: You bunch that haven\u2019t seen anything. You think this kind of appearance can be considered\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026f.u.c.k! He really has a G.o.d-given appearance. Floor owner, come out and fight me!!!Floor 4: Not to exaggerate, but I was so attacked by his beauty that I crowed. The people in my neighborhood all thought it was already sunrise!Floor 5: Sister upstairs, I need to remind you that only roosters crow. Female chickens don\u2019t know how to crow.\u2026\u2026Shang Que completely ignored the obsessive fangirl comments in the beginning and furiously scrolled down the page until he found a few different pictures that had appeared.He had first come across them on Lu Lingxi\u2019s phone, but was too embarra.s.sed to examine them too closely in front of her. This was why he had waited until now to revisit the post for examination.Floor 77: The sisters upstairs should give up early on. This man already has a significant other\u2026\u2026his S.O. is a man too, faint-smile-with-a-hint-of-fatigue.jpg\u2026\u2026These are some pictures my friend at Fu City University sent me. This little gege caused quite a stir at their school\u2019s graduation ceremony a while back, but\u2026\u2026he went for a handsome senior at their school. He brought a huge bouquet of roses, please experience these feelings [picture]The picture that this netizen uploaded was the one where Shang Que was holding the bouquet of roses and had first appeared in front of Yu Zhengdu to wish him a happy graduation. The person who had taken the picture had been in a good spot, right across from both of their profiles, so got a good angle. The framing was well done too, coincidentally getting both of them on two distinct sides; the enormous bouquet of roses was in the middle as the two looked up at each other, clear-cut facial profiles washed over with a faint layer of golden sunlight.The scene could be said to be perfect. The people in the tower agreed too.Floor 78: f.u.c.k! These two men look so good together!!!Floor 79: This school senior is a little too handsome\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Meimei has lost.Floor 80: How come all the men I\u2019m into already have boyfriends?!!!Floor 81: Goodness, can I say that I like this school senior\u2019s face more? Watch me perform a switching of interest live!\u2026\u2026Floor 222: Sister of floor 77 stop spreading false news. I\u2019m a current student of Fu City University and was there that day too. This graduating senior is quite famous at our school, and was also a part of the anti-corruption incident during the graduation ceremony. If the people in this tower don\u2019t believe me, they can go look it up themselves. The guy in the original post isn\u2019t his boyfriend, but his boss. He was only there out of courtesy that day.Floor 223: Is the sister upstairs joking? A boss attending his employee\u2019s graduation ceremony? And gifting roses? You believe that society could have such an innocent relations.h.i.+p between a boss and employee?Floor 224: What the f.u.c.k? Innocent Boss and Flirty Senior?Further down, the entire comment section of the post started getting stranger and stranger. Over a thousand floors were discussing from several different possible angles whether Shang Que really wanted to get in Yu Zhengdu\u2019s pants or truly just wanted to keep him around as an employee.But, the comment that appeared the most was: Meimei has lost. I give them my blessings!Shang Que, who had very diligently scanned over the entire post, felt abnormally pleased. He thought about it, then sent the link of the post to Yu Zhengdu.My broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010Link: Hurry and get in here to understand what a G.o.d-given appearance is!!!!!!!!!\u3011My broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010Look at this\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010\u2026\u2026You don\u2019t need to especially message me to brag about your looks?\u3011My broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010Scroll lower.

What?\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010Link: Voting: Who do you think between landry and beautiful CEO is a better match with our little senior?\u3011Shang Que had originally sent the link to Yu Zhengdu because he had been feeling strangely boastful. He hadn\u2019t imagined that Yu Zhengdu would suddenly send him a more exhilarating link back. He clicked into it and almost spat out a mouthful of Underworld energy.The link Yu Zhengdu had sent was one from Fu City University\u2019s private forum. It covered less information, but was much more to the point.t.i.tle: Voting: Who do you think between landry and beautiful CEO is a better match with our little senior?Main floor: Everyone else is very concerned with Hou Guangzong and the dumba.s.s dean of the College of Information. Only I! Only I am concerned about our handsome and talented little senior Zhengdu and who he will ultimately leave with. One is the idol of our whole university, the top-notch CTO of Cosmic Factory; the other is the astoundingly beautiful, dependant on stocks (slashed out, roses) Boss who appeared from the Heavens. If I were senior Zhengdu, I would definitely not know who to choose, hesitating in the middle. Can everyone bear to let our beloved senior suffer so much distress? How about we help him make a decision:Option 1: landry (mature and reliable, above average skills)Option 2: beautiful CEO (appearance is power, gentle and handsome)Option 3: All options above are impossible, senior Zhengdu is mine!The results of the voting revealed that options 1 and 2 were barely tied while option 3 rose steadily and rapidly\u2026\u2026My broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026What do they mean?\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010Keep calm. They\u2019ve arranged 108 significant others for me. All my previous CP\u2019s are enough to film a version of \u201cWater Margins\u201d .\u3011Shang Que didn\u2019t reply for a long time, then finally sent back a very angry message.My broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010Why am I tied with that laboratory? Also, he\u2019s not as mature as me.\u3011My broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010I\u2019m over a thousand years older than him!\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u3011A gamer\u2019s desire for victory is too strong, he\u2019s even compet.i.tive about stuff like this\u2026\u2026Yu Zhengdu:\u3010First of all\u2026\u2026lan\u2019s name isn\u2019t laboratory\u2026\u2026\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010Secondly\u2026\u2026My schoolmates don\u2019t know you have so much seniority. They\u2019re referring to maturity as in appearance-wise\u3011But Shang Que still seemed unnaturally displeased.My broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010Can I pay to get what I want for this poll?\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Obviously not.\u3011He thought about it and decided that Boss was a little bit tragic. In his games, he was always getting beat up by others. Now, he couldn\u2019t even win a simple poll on the school forum. He was the Ghost King for G.o.d\u2019s sake! What a pity.A while later, Yu Zhengdu replied in exasperation:\u3010But if you really want to win, there\u2019s something I can do\u3011My broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010?\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010Wait a bit\u3011Shortly after, Yu Zhengdu finally replied:\u3010Okay. Look at it again.\u3011Shang Que clicked into the voting link once more, bewildered. He discovered that there was a new update to the post, so scrolled down to look at the newest reply. Only to see a comment from an ID named \u201c Autumn Rain Doesn\u2019t Cross the River \u201d.Autumn Rain Doesn\u2019t Cross the River: Thank you everyone for helping me make plans. I choose beautiful Boss. pleased.jpgAutumn Rain Doesn\u2019t Cross the River was the public ID Yu Zhengdu used in their school forum. Normally, he rarely commented, so as soon as he replied to this post, he garnered a lot of attention. This post that had been steadily losing popularity suddenly became the topic of conversation again. In an instant, an innumerous amount of ID\u2019s appeared to show up in the same frame as him. Little accounts owned by people of unspecified genders started crying and shouting that their love story with senior Zhengdu was ending up with a BE .Because the concerned party had personally made an announcement, the number of votes for beautiful CEO immediately skyrocketed.Shang Que felt strangely pleased. He happily refreshed the post a few more times, then realized something was off.My broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010Why are they saying you\u2019re a pig trotter?\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010[Link][Link][Link][Link]\u2026\u2026\u3011Shang Que didn\u2019t know anything, so opened them one by one. Immediately:\u3010\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u3011Those links were of CP polls that had been posted in the Fu City University forum in past years. As Yu Zhengdu said, his schoolmates had set him up with dozens of CP\u2019s, spanning across the entire university and all majors.And Yu Zhengdu who had been super active back then had clicked into every link and expressed his own opinion, choosing one person this time and a different one the next.My broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010You can reincarnate into a pig trotter in the next life.\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010????????????? Why???\u3011My broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010Because you are one\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026I refuse to die!\u3011Because of the post on the forum, Shang Que\u2019s heart felt like it had been on a roller coaster ride. He refreshed the post one more time, then voted for himself out of unwillingness to lose. Finally, he reluctantly closed the page and started reading the official reports on his desk.After browsing through them, the little bit of a good mood he had still been in disappeared completely.Their company\u2019s sales had started increasing for only a few months, but now had already bottlenecked. In the past month, business had stopped growing, regardless of whether the product was their luck-changing jades or their Underworld energy detection package. In fact, it seemed to be coming to a standstill. Though they had made a lot of profit previously, this wouldn\u2019t be enough to support the costs of rent for the new office, the wages for the new human employees, or the continuous developmental fees that needed to be paid.The reason their sales had stopped was very simple: though their original customers were extremely wealthy and willing to spend a lot of money, in the end, they were only a small percentage of the population. The amount of jade and times they needed to undergo Underworld energy detection were limited. Most families wouldn\u2019t be willing to buy a ton of jade to keep at home, or get an Underworld energy detection test once every day.Currently, the number of employees working for Shang Que kept growing. The office s.p.a.ces under his management were increasing too. He also had a CTO who kept reminding him about the developmental budget by his ear every day. He no longer was the Ghost King who only needed to pay the water and electricity bill every month.This was his first time very clearly feeling the pressure of being the one and only company in the Underworld.Thus, that afternoon, Luofeng Life Management Company Ltd. Co. had their first official meeting since the company had been registered. The topic of their discussion was how to come up with an effective plan for their future businesses and how to allow the company to become successful in the long run.The company\u2019s employees who received the notification: \u2026\u2026\u2026Who would\u2019ve thought, h.e.l.l that had once commanded the entire Underworld now also has to ponder the route of revolutionizing their business.Underworld spirits who had once only needed to receive the sacrifices from mortals now also had to work for their own survival, using their hands to make a living.The socialist revolution was coming at them full speed. Even though they were ghosts, they still had to use their brains and roll up their sleeves to work in order to not be left in the dust!The author has something to say:Shang Que: Pig trotter warning!Zhengdu: I apply to quit!h.e.l.l\u2019s development committee: h.e.l.l in these new times, is so difficult\u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

New and old employees alike all expressed their ideas, causing the meeting\u2019s atmosphere to become very intense.Though this was the first time everyone was doing business with the mortal realm as ghosts, they had all been humans previously, so were extremely familiar with the possible marketing strategies. This was especially true because their new employees had all been carefully chosen from tens of thousands of applicants. Among them were a few who had previously been elites in their fields prior to death. When it came to marketing plans, they were more than prepared.Of course, there were several difficulties too. These mainly stemmed from the barrier between the Underworld and mortal realm, as well as the nature of their products. Consequently, they couldn\u2019t use all of the promotional or marketing strategies that they had been familiar with in life. For example, the most common method of marketing in the mortal realm was through phone calls, but if they tried selling their products with this technique, they would definitely get reported so much that their company would be forced to close temporarily for examination.There were also restrictions on making ads. TV ads were very carefully inspected, and their products would most certainly not be able to pa.s.s this inspection. The only option remaining was online ads, but the operationalization of such a plan was difficult too.\u201cIt would actually be best if we could get a celebrity to be our brand amba.s.sador.\u201d The person speaking was a new employee named Qu Guangzhao. He was the one who had come up with the most suggestions during this meeting. Even Yu Zhengdu, who was in a different department than him, had remembered his name and face.Not for anything else, simply because n.o.body had ever seen such a workaholic human when alive and had also never seen such a workaholic ghost after pa.s.sing. Apparently, he was in the middle of challenging his personal record of continuous working from when alive, because he believed that in theory, since ghosts couldn\u2019t die, they should be able to set a new record for longest time spent working continuously.As a result, everyone thought that he had died from overworking. However, after checking his death records, they could only say, someone so hardworking had a body in great health. He hadn\u2019t died because of work, but because of vacation\u2014\u2014he had been surfing during vacation and unfortunately drowned. This story made all the other ghosts sigh.Qu Guangzhao a.n.a.lyzed, \u201cOur product is a bit special. The key to marketing it is to gain the customers\u2019 trust. The fastest way to build trust is to get someone famous to advocate for it. Thus, if we want to expand our market, the best plan is to invite an influential celebrity to be our brand endorser.\u201d\u201cUn.\u201d Shang Que nodded. \u201cSounds like a plan.\u201dYu Zhengdu conveniently b.u.t.ted in, \u201cCelebrity endors.e.m.e.nt\u2026\u2026What\u2019s the budget?\u201dQu Guangzhao pulled out a neatly printed piece of A4 paper and handed it to Shang Que. \u201cThese are the prices I found for current celebrity endors.e.m.e.nts.\u201dShang Que grabbed it and took a look, then calmly flipped the A4 paper over and covered it. He propped his chin on his hand and emotionlessly said, \u201cPa.s.s. Next idea.\u201dQu Guangzhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu immediately understood. He glanced at Qu Guangzhao and explained, \u201cDo you have another plan that\u2019s more suitable for our company?\u201dQu Guangzhao asked, bewildered, \u201cMore specifically?\u201dYu Zhengdu faintly smiled. \u201cCheap.\u201dQu Guangzhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dQu Guangzhao lived up to his name of being the ghost who loved work the most in the Underworld. Though he was slightly taken aback, he still managed to respond fairly quickly as he said, \u201cI do, but if you want to spend less money, you\u2019ll have to spend more time and energy\u2026\u2026\u201dThe new plan he proposed was to have Luofeng begin brand operations itself. In the age of the Internet, starting a brand was difficult, but also easy. For example, companies could open social media accounts, such as Weibo or official WeChat accounts. By using these accounts, they were able to gain fans and build trust with their fans. Consequently, it was much easier to sell their products.But it wasn\u2019t an easy task starting a social media account. Unless someone was exceptionally lucky and managed to suddenly get popular, each account was operated by an entire team working hard to achieve the ideal results.However, considering Luofeng\u2019s low budget and special situation, this was truly the best possible plan at the moment.Shang Que pondered a bit, then agreed to include this method in their overall development plan. He immediately placed Qu Guangzhao in charge of registering the company\u2019s account. Because all profiting projects had been transferred to their subsidiary company, consequently, this account was named using the subsidiary company\u2019s name. Currently, the subsidiary company had already been officially registered; with Shang Que\u2019s approval, it was called \u201c Amazing Future \u201d.Of course, this was only the first step to building brand trust. Other marketing strategies needed to be put into place as well.After the meeting, Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que left the room together.Shang Que\u2019s face was serious for once. He told Yu Zhengdu, \u201cNo matter what, I will definitely ensure that we have enough money for your salary and a big enough budget for development.\u201dYu Zhengdu stared at his solemn expression and smiled. He said, \u201cI trust you.\u201dShang Que\u2019s expression cleared up slightly. He promised again, \u201cBefore our company\u2019s Weibo account has ten thousand active fans, I won\u2019t spend money on games anymore.\u201dYu Zhengdu thought about it a bit, then very sincerely stated, \u201cWith regards to our current profits, I think we can afford you spending three to five thousand on games.\u201dAs the two spoke, Lu Lingxi finished up a phone call and shouted for Shang Que, \u201cBoss, Big Eye Livestream called again. They said they can pay more\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que\u2019s eyebrows furrowed slightly. He was just about to refuse when he heard Yu Zhengdu ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dLu Lingxi glanced at Shang Que. Seeing that he didn\u2019t say anything, she relayed the situation with Big Eye Livestream inviting Shang Que to partic.i.p.ate in their program to Yu Zhengdu. At the end, she added, \u201cBut they just called and said that aside from Boss, they also want to invite you.\u201dYu Zhengdu was confused. \u201cWhy me?\u201dLu Lingxi\u2019s expression was conflicted. \u201cApparently someone reposted the CP poll from your school onto the gossip forum. Right now your CP with Boss is extremely popular\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026People these days have that much free time on their hands?\u201dLu Lingxi was speechless too. \u201cSeems like it.\u201dShe continued, \u201cThen I\u2019ll reject them\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu was silent for a moment as he thought about it. He interrupted her to ask, \u201cCan you discuss with them? Payment isn\u2019t an issue, but we want them to introduce our company\u2019s name\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter he said this, Shang Que realized too. Though livestream companies weren\u2019t mainstream media, they still garnered an impressive audience for popular programs. Luofeng\u2019s products needed promotion right now, so if they could appear on such a well-received show, they would definitely manage to gain people\u2019s attention.Lu Lingxi nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll discuss with them.\u201dThe administration was pretty chill at the livestream company. Big Eye Livestream replied fairly quickly. They weren\u2019t able to make a direct advertis.e.m.e.nt for the company, but could include their business t.i.tles when introducing them as guests. This way, their company would be subtly advertised.Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que discussed this, then agreed.But only after agreeing did Yu Zhengdu finally remember to ask Lu Lingxi what kind of program they would be attending.Lu Lingxi said, \u201cSeems like an outdoor challenge course. Things like jumping across boards in the air, walking on water b.a.l.l.s, that stuff.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026f.u.c.k.\u201d Weren\u2019t they purposefully trying to make things difficult for homebodies!Was it too late to go back on his words?But Shang Que\u2019s eyes slightly brightened. \u201cThe type where you run across the water in a see-through ball?\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Boss looks like he\u2019s antic.i.p.ating it a little bit?Lu Lingxi: Sigh, starting a business isn\u2019t easy. The Ghost King has to make a living by performing.***Big Eye Livestream was one of the newer broadcasting platforms in the country, but was a rising star. Though they started late, their operating abilities were exceptional. Their company had a specialized team of scouts that were always on the lookout for new celebrities; they had already discovered and trained quite a few popular non-celebrity streamers. Because of this, though their company was new, it wasn\u2019t in any way more lacking than the other platforms.This time, their one year anniversary celebration was planned quite well too. Not only would it last a long time, they had also split it up into different topics. The one Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que had been invited to attend was called \u201cPalpitating Youth.\u201d It was an outdoor challenge course mainly geared towards the platform\u2019s streamers and other people famous online. There were four episodes total. Each episode had one male and female celebrity as guests.Coincidentally, the celebrity guests on the episode Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que were attending were two that they were familiar with. The man was named Qin Yuejian, and the girl was named Zeng Rong. They were from the same drama\u2014\u2014the historical idol one that Shang Que had complained about for a very long time,\u300aOld Dreams of Bianliang\u300b.Qin Yuejian had just graduated from university and had debuted through an idol survival show. He was currently quite popular and had many fans. Because of this, not soon after the show had ended, he had been chosen to play the second male lead in Old Dreams of Bianliang. Zeng Rong had been the third female lead, the evil female character whose final outcome Shang Que had been very interested in, Miss Bai Mudan.Yu Zhengdu glanced at the celebrity lineup, then thought about what Shang Que had said about Old Dreams of Bianliang online. He felt extremely conflicted and couldn\u2019t help secretly whispering to interview Boss, \u201cCan I ask how you feel seeing Miss Bai Mudan in person?\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d Shang Que\u2019s expression was puzzled.Yu Zhengdu subtly pointed at Zeng Rong only to see a look of realization wash over Shang Que\u2019s face. \u201cRecently she\u2019s acting as Xiao Lingli in Hooray for First Loves. I like her.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d How many idol dramas did Boss actually watch?Wait, that wasn\u2019t right. He played so many games everyday, how did he have the time to watch so many dramas?The activities in \u201cPalpitating Youth\u201d would be simultaneously livestreamed on the Big Eye Livestream app. Because Qin Yuejian and Zeng Rong were attending, there were already a large number of fans waiting online before the program even started. The comments were filled with confessions for these two idols.They stayed there all the way until the livestream officially started. The host started introducing the guests today. Excluding the two celebrities, all the other attendees were popular streamers from Big Eye Livestream or famous on the Internet. After every introduction, the comments would be filled with people cracking jokes. But ultimately, they were just there for some fun, so their numbers couldn\u2019t compare to those of the fans of actual celebrities.When it came time to introduce Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que, the number of comments across the screen suddenly increased rapidly.\u3010f.u.c.k, he\u2019s so handsome!!!! Is this a newly debuted celebrity?\u3011\u3010Insanely beautiful appearance has hurt me x2\u2026\u2026Big Eye is amazing. Where did they get this extraordinary pairing?\u3011\u3010b.u.t.ting in to say, I think they\u2019re even better looking than celebrities. They look more natural and untainted\u3011There were also netizens who had seen the post on the gossip forum so recognized them immediately.\u3010Yi, isn\u2019t this senior Yu and CEO?\u3011Because the post in Fu City University\u2019s forum had called Yu Zhengdu 'senior\u201d, everyone online now called him 'senior Yu\u201d suggestively when discussing him. Similarly, the story of the supposed overbearing boss gifting roses to fight for an employee had spread far and wide. Though Shang Que looked young, he had still honorably gained the nickname \u201cCEO\u201d.\u3010Ohoh, it really is them. They look so good together!!!\u3011Big Eye Livestream had someone keeping an eye on the comments during broadcasts to be able to provide the host with real-time updates of what was going on. The MC would also adjust his interactions with the guests in response to the fans\u2019 reactions. Now, he received the news of the increase in comments so very cleverly handed the microphone to Yu Zhengdu. \u201cSenior Yu, your CP with CEO is quite popular online right now. I heard that you also said that you wanted to choose CEO. Is that your honest opinion?\u201dYu Zhengdu\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change at all after hearing this question full of implications. He calmly held up his right hand, then smiled and asked, \u201cTake a look at what this is?\u201dThe MC looked bewildered, but still very agreeably leaned in to take a closer look. He inspected the whole arm, yet didn\u2019t manage to find anything. He asked in confusion, \u201cWhat is\u2026\u2026this?\u201dYu Zhengdu proudly dragged out, \u201cThis is a living and breathing pork trotter.\u201dAs soon as he spoke, the host\u2019s face immediately turned into the color of pig liver. The comment section also exploded in laughter.\u3010Hahahahahaha, senior Yu is really harsh\u3011\u3010Senior Yu\u2026\u2026clearly knows he\u2019s sc.u.m\u2026\u2026\u3011\u3010PD hurry and give the shot to CEO ah\u3011The host was so shocked he blanked out for a moment before finally wiping his face. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to be this type of senior.\u201dHe refused to admit defeat so kept asking suggestive questions. This time, he turned around to inquire Shang Que, \u201cCEO, senior Yu just admitted that he\u2019s a pork trotter. What do you have to say to this?\u201dShang Que grabbed the microphone. \u201cPork trotter? I\u2019ll eat pork trotters too\u2026\u2026\u201dWith his response, the comment section immediately went crazy once more.\u3010?????? Does he know what he\u2019s saying?\u3011\u3010?? I suspect that CEO was just out of it. Is he blanking out because he\u2019s hungry, so he only heard the two words \u201cpork trotters\u201d?\u3011\u3010CEO hurry and wake up. Pork trotters aren\u2019t worth it!\u3011The two of them already looked good. This provocative response just so happened to excite the nerves of CP fans. In an instant, the comment section reached an unprecedented number of comments. Even after Qin Yuejian and Zeng Rong started their introductions, some of their CP fans\u2019 comments still remained. It only slightly calmed down after the activities officially started.For the actual activities, the partic.i.p.ants were split into two opposing teams. Aside from Qin Yuejian and Zeng Rong who were the fixed team leaders of these two teams, all other members were decided through picking sticks. Though it was supposed to be random, the production team had secretly arranged for everything already so that the compet.i.tion would be more exhilarating to watch. For example, Shang Que and Yu Zhengdu, who had been invited onto the show because of the CP post, had been placed into two different teams. Shang Que was in Zeng Rong\u2019s team, and Yu Zhengdu was in Qin Yuejian\u2019s.After they chose teams, the MC spoke regretfully, \u201cWho would\u2019ve thought that right after senior Yu made such a bold statement about being a pork trotter, he would be forced to separate from CEO. Could this be the supposed fate?\u201dThey split into two groups. Each team leader led their team through stretches.Zeng Rong\u2019s character Bai Mudan was extremely evil, but in person, she was quite lively. However, she also knew how to act on variety shows. Thus, she held up both hands and yelled confidently, \u201cComrades, today we must do our best. We can\u2019t lose to the pig trotter!\u201dAfter speaking, the PD very understandingly turned the camera onto Shang Que.Shang Que looked up and very seriously said, \u201cI want to step on the water b.a.l.l.s.\u201dEveryone: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRespond to the joke ah!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40 - ObsessionPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 40 - ObsessionThough Shang Que very desperately wanted to go play with the water b.a.l.l.s, he ultimately was here to put on a show. Things couldn\u2019t always go how he wanted them to, so he needed to cooperate with the investor\u2019s plan and follow the schedule.Because the activities with water could ruin the guests\u2019 hair and makeup, they were scheduled to be last. Shang Que could only join everyone else in partic.i.p.ating in the acupressure mat race, one-legged b.u.mping game, and more first.Thus, the first mysterious scene appeared in the livestream.During the opening game, the acupressure mat race, almost all of the guests had on pained expressions. As they ran, they continuously shouted in agony. Those streamers who were more exaggerated in daily life were even more extra and had their faces twisted in suffering, allowing the audience to get an idea of how much pain they were in. The comment section was filled with \u201c ey ey ey ey \u201d.Who would\u2019ve thought that when the camera panned over Shang Que\u2019s face, only four words could be seen: Has no soul whatsoever.Of course, only Yu Zhengdu knew\u2026\u2026It wasn\u2019t that he had no soul whatsoever, but that he really only had a soul remaining.Shang Que\u2019s gaze was empty as he emotionlessly finished running the entire route. He then turned around to look at his teammates. \u201cHurry, I\u2019m in a rush.\u201dTeammate: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Brother, can you make some expressions. If you\u2019re like this, it\u2019ll be difficult for us to explain to the audience.As expected, the livestream channel was filled with a bunch of ellipses:\u3010\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u3011\u3010???????????\u3011\u3010Is everyone else acting or is CEO acting?\u3011\u3010CEO doesn\u2019t feel pain?\u3011\u3010Could this be the hallmark of overbearing bosses\u2026\u2026will as strong as steel?\u3011When it came time for \u201chappy ball b.u.mping\u201d, Shang Que once again caused the livestream to go:\u3010\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u3011The rules for \u201chappy ball b.u.mping\u201d were very simple. A large foam board was set up. All members from both teams would play simultaneously while wearing custom outfits blown up with air. After transforming into round balloons, they would use their bodies to b.u.mp into others. Whoever fell on the ground or got b.u.mped off the foam board would be eliminated. The team whose members all got eliminated first would lose.When he finished changing, Yu Zhengdu leaned over to look at Boss who usually had an air of elegance. He wanted to see how funny his round appearance would be, but when he actually saw him, he immediately felt wronged. He turned to rant to his teammate angrily, \u201cLook at my boss. He\u2019s dressed like that but still looks so handsome!!!\u201dTeammate: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Are you complaining or bragging?\u201cHappy ball b.u.mping\u201d was very simple, but also very intense. There was a tall guy who had previously been an athlete on Qin Yuejian\u2019s team. He was large and steady; everyone he b.u.mped into fell over. With practically no suspense, he basically guaranteed the success for their entire team. Qin Yuejian\u2019s teammates started high-fiving each other in celebration as they watched him knock over the members of Zeng Rong\u2019s team like a bulldozer. \u201cSteady steady.\u201dOnly Yu Zhengdu maintained his reason. He reminded his teammates to look at Shang Que, only to see Shang Que standing by the edge where he had stayed the whole game. His gaze was blank, a question very clearly displayed on his face\u2014\u2014So when can I finally go walk on the water b.a.l.l.s?Qin Yuejian and his other teammates only thought Yu Zhengdu was being too cautious. Qin Yuejian patted Yu Zhengdu\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. If CEO\u2019s in such a state, he\u2019ll get knocked over in seconds.\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu couldn\u2019t exactly say, you can\u2019t knock over a soul ah\u2026\u2026As expected, not much later, tall guy eliminated everyone else in Zeng Rong\u2019 team by himself. He started preparing for his final victory. He turned to look at his only opponent remaining: Shang Que. His plan was to knock him over when the other wasn\u2019t paying attention.Tall guy was like a moveable small mountain. He charged over to Shang Que\u2019s side steadily and rapidly. There was a confident smile on his face as he made to b.u.mp into the other.Comments:\u3010CEO Hurry and wake up!!!\u3011\u3010You\u2019re the entire village\u2026\u2026 pei , the entire company\u2019s last hope!!\u3011His teammates were extremely anxious too. Zeng Rong was so panicked she kept jumping up and down. \u201cCEO, watch your back\u2014\u2014\u201d\u201cHurry and get out of the way, hurry hurry hurry\u2014\u2014\u201dBut everyone\u2019s warnings didn\u2019t come in time. Shang Que heard his teammates\u2019 shouts in his daze, so turned his head to glance at them. He asked, \u201cWhy are you guys so agitated?\u201dEveryone: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dComments:\u3010\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026The CEO is a double agent, right?\u3011At the same time, heavy-duty bulldozer accomplished his goal. He charged forward to crash into Shang Que with the force of a storm.Comments:\u3010Tragic\u2026\u2026CEO\u2019s going to be dead meat ba \u3011The PD specially switched cameras too, giving this final match a close-up. The lens got closer and closer.From afar, Qin Yuejian and his teammates started cheering, \u201cWe\u2019ve wonk2014;k2014;\u201dAs the sounds of their celebration started, they heard a loud \u201cpeng\u201d. Brother bulldozer\u2019s ball and Shang Que\u2019s ball crashed into each other. Then, he got forcefully knocked back, to a distance of over a meter away, and fell onto the ground.Shang Que stood there, immovable as a mountain. He turned around to glance at tall guy who was sprawled on the floor and coldy opened his mouth, \u201cWhat?\u201dTall guy: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dTall guy couldn\u2019t stand how different reality was from his expectations. He sprawled out onto the ground and started furiously pounding the foam board. He wailed, \u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2014\u2014I don\u2019t believe it\u2014\u2014\u201dThe entire scene simultaneously become shocked: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dComments:\u3010\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026????\u3011\u3010Wait a minute. Did I accidentally skip part of the plot?\u3011\u3010CEO doesn\u2019t only have an iron will. He\u2019s just a solid piece of iron, right?\u3011\u3010Did he secretly hide steel boards in his ball?\u3011Zeng Rong\u2019s team managed to s.n.a.t.c.h a victory out from right under the other team\u2019s nose. For a moment, they were all frozen in shock. A while later, they finally realized what had happened and started cheering loudly, surrounding Shang Que in a circle and high-fiving him.Shang Que sighed and perfunctorily completed this celebratory ritual.Qin Yuejian\u2019s team was bewildered too. Qin Yuejian turned to look at Yu Zhengdu in disbelief. \u201cHow did he manage to do that?\u201dYu Zhengdu very seriously answered, \u201cHe didn\u2019t do anything\u2026\u2026\u201dQin Yuejian: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Could this be the legendary 800 meter filter ?After \u201chappy ball b.u.mping\u201d was a slightly more dangerous activity\u2014\u2014jumping across suspended boards. Guests from both teams had to get on a platform elevated ten meters off the ground and tie on safety harnesses. They would then have to hop over two boards not connected in the middle.This exercise wasn\u2019t actually physically difficult. It was mainly a test of psychological endurance. Those with even the slightest acrophobia would be unable to take a step forward after seeing how high up they were, much less jump across boards suspended in midair.In order to set an example for their team members, the two team captains decided to go first this time.While the workers were tying the safety harnesses onto the captains, the members of both teams were standing further back, chatting while they observed. Yu Zhengdu leaned in close to Shang Que and whispered encouragements to him. \u201cXiao Shang, hang on a little longer and act more like a human. It\u2019s almost time for the water b.a.l.l.s\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que scanned him, then slowly made a noise of acknowledgement. He said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll do my best to try being a human.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Ghosts can really say that without feeling burdened at all.He was in the middle of being speechless when suddenly chaos broke out around them. Shortly after, Qin Yuejian\u2019s startled scream sounded, \u201cAo ao ao ao ao\u2014\u2014\u201dHe looked over to see that Qin Yuejian had failed the challenge. He had originally already jumped over, but upon turning around, had accidentally slipped and lost his balance. Now, his entire person was leaning backwards, arms flailing around. The shout had been reflexive, but caused the entire scene to become wrought with tension.Everyone watched with hitched breaths as he wobbled on the edge of the board. Suddenly, someone yelled, \u201cOh no\u2014\u2014His safety harness is loose\u2014\u2014\u201dAs soon as he spoke, the audience all turned their attention onto the ropes around him. As expected, Qin Yuejian\u2019s safety harness had somehow become loose. An accident now could cause a death.Immediately, everyone started shouting, \u201cHurry hurry hurry\u2014\u2014Grab him\u2014\u2014\u201dThe workers\u2019 faces immediately paled. They reached their hands out to pull at him, but weren\u2019t in time at all. Qin Yuejian had originally still been flailing, but upon hearing that his safety harness was loose, he started panicking. In the end, he wasn\u2019t able to maintain his balance and plunged backwards.The actual scene and livestream comments were filled with fl.u.s.tered reactions: \u201cAh\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201dIn this moment, a safety rope suddenly flew past everyone. At such a crucial time, it headed towards Qin Yuejian. Simultaneously, Qin Yuejian who was supposed to be falling at a constant speed momentarily paused midair. This pause was extremely short, so short that n.o.body realized anything unnatural had happened. But this pause was what gave him enough time to reach a hand out and grab the rope.Ultimately, he didn\u2019t plummet to his death. He held onto the rope and hung in midair. This unexpected change caused everyone to go into shock. Only Yu Zhengdu maintained his calm. He urgently called out, \u201cHurry and pull him up.\u201dThe workers instantly regained their senses and rushed forward to pull Qin Yuejian up in a scramble.When he got onto the platform, Qin Yuejian\u2019s face was already pale. His hands couldn\u2019t stop trembling, but still, he forced out a smile. \u201cEverything\u2019s fine now.\u201dThough he said everything was fine, the workers all knew that things wouldn\u2019t end so simply. The cameraman made a split second decision to placate the worried audience before shutting off the livestream. Then, he stood up and roared, \u201cWho was in charge of the safety harnesses?\u201dEveryone on set looked at each other. The guests, who were still shocked, all retreated far away from the platform. The s.p.a.ce in front of it was empty, allowing the workers in charge of safety to be in full view. Their heads were lowered and they didn\u2019t dare to speak.The atmosphere all around was extremely tense. The originally relaxed air had completely disappeared.Even without asking, everyone knew who had been in charge of the safety harnesses previously. The workers were only doing this to give Qin Yuejian a satisfying answer; they wanted the man to step up himself and admit his mistakes.But this mistake was too serious. That person was shocked too. His entire body was trembling and he didn\u2019t dare to open his mouth at all.Qin Yuejian watched as what had originally been a fun activity turn into this current situation. He didn\u2019t feel great either, so wanted to say something to better the atmosphere. But suddenly, a terrified screech sounded out, followed by a worker\u2019s cries, \u201cSave me, save me\u2014\u2014\u201dEveryone hurriedly spread out to get a better look, only to see that a worker had somehow lost his balance and fallen over the railing around the platform. He had only managed to stop himself from plunging all the way down by immediately grabbing onto a pole. However, he was still suspended in midair. It was a dangerous situation.Amidst the chaos, someone suddenly asked, \u201cWasn\u2019t he the one who put the harness on Yuejian?\u201dQin Yuejian\u2019s expression changed too. The workers hadn\u2019t expected for this situation to repeat itself, so were temporarily bewildered as well. They rushed forward to grab the man.But strangely, though the worker\u2019s hands were holding onto the pole tightly, his person was extremely heavy. Several people went up to pull him, but couldn\u2019t move him an inch.His face was deathly pale. He kept shouting, \u201cI can\u2019t hold on anymore\u2014\u2014\u201dYu Zhengdu looked at Shang Que. Shang Que didn\u2019t say anything, but stepped forward silently. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201dThe workers were extremely panicked. \u201cEy, you can\u2019t. He\u2019s too heavy\u2026\u2026\u201dAs soon as they finished speaking, they saw Shang Que lower one hand and grab that person\u2019s wrist. He yanked and successfully rescued the other.Everyone: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026?????\u201dDid this CEO lift weights everyday?Though everyone was suspicious, now wasn\u2019t the time to be asking questions about this. They all gathered around Qin Yuejian and the worker to comfort them. Originally, the supervisor had been about to scold the safety worker, but after this, it wouldn\u2019t be right to do so. He could only turn around and arrange for things to be done about the aftermath.With such a large accident, though it hadn\u2019t ultimately ended up in disaster, the activity couldn\u2019t keep going on. The workers helped the guests leave. An especially large amount of people guarded Qin Yuejian until he could get into his van and rest.Everyone still felt lingering fear. The scene descended into chaos, but Qin Yuejian remembered to ask who had saved him just now. Big Eye Livestream\u2019s workers only remembered this fact after he brought it up. The incident had occurred too fast, and n.o.body had filmed it. After asking around, they finally found someone who said they seemed to remember that it was Shang Que who had thrown the rope.Thus, Qin Yuejian wanted to personally find Shang Que to express his grat.i.tude. Coincidentally, Shang Que and Yu Zhengdu were on their way to see him. His a.s.sistant let the two of them into the van. Qin Yuejian hurriedly rushed forward and profusely thanked, \u201cThank you for saving me just now.\u201dShang Que didn\u2019t accept his appreciation. Instead, he knowingly looked at the other and said, \u201cEven if I didn\u2019t save you, something else would\u2019ve, right?\u201dQin Yuejian\u2019s expression subtly changed. He glanced at his a.s.sistant, then told her and the others to leave first. After confirming that no outsiders were present, he slowly sighed and said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure I understand what you mean.\u201dYu Zhengdu very logically asked, \u201cWhy did you have everyone else leave if you don\u2019t understand?\u201dQin Yuejian was immediately rendered speechless. The two people in front of him didn\u2019t seem like they were about to explain anything. He finally muttered, \u201cHow did you guys find out?\u201dYu Zhengdu slightly furrowed his brows. \u201cYou\u2019re really keeping something ?\u201dn.o.body had been able to tell just now, but he had seen too many supernatural occurrences lately, so managed to detect something strange about the situation today. Regardless of how Qin Yuejian had been suddenly saved at such a critical moment or how the worker who had tied on the safety harness had mysteriously taken a fall, things weren\u2019t adding up.Shang Que\u2019s actions verified his thoughts, but strangely, even Shang Que wasn\u2019t able to detect the general cause of everything.What could be confirmed though, was that the problem was with Qin Yuejian. But there weren\u2019t any Underworld spirits around him, none trying to possess him or kept by him as pets.Upon hearing this, Qin Yuejian hurriedly waved his hands. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d He mysteriously leaned forward and said, \u201cActually, I\u2019m very curious about this occurrence too\u2026\u2026\u201dAccording to Qin Yuejian, in the past few years, he oftentimes encountered such strange things. Regardless of if he went out for vacation or work, he would always run into some sort of danger, but would also always be able to escape unscathed. He had never even cut his finger while cooking. However, those had all been little things, so he had always just thought of them as coincidences or bouts of good luck.This was his first time encountering a situation as dangerous as today\u2019s. Even he himself only confirmed that something unnatural was happening after today\u2019s incident.Qin Yuejian was somewhat nervous. He sneakily whispered, \u201cSay, do you think I\u2019m that\u2026\u2026legendary\u2026\u2026chosen one of the Heavens?\u201dYu Zhengdu\u2019s face was grim. \u201cKeep dreaming.\u201dQin Yuejian was a bit depressed. \u201cWell how else would you explain everything?\u201dYu Zhengdu rubbed his chin. \u201cA safe guess would be that you\u2019ve run into a ghost.\u201dQin Yuejian\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201dYu Zhengdu conveniently took out his business card and handed it over. \u201cI didn\u2019t get the chance to introduce myself earlier. Our company deals with the high tech removal and prevention of evil. Believe in technology; stay safe.\u201dThough Big Eye Livestream hadn\u2019t allowed them to advertise their company on camera, it would still be nice to garner some business from the entertainment industry. After all, there was a lot of money in entertainment. Better yet, they were all superst.i.tious.Qin Yuejian: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu saw the doubt on his face, so pulled out a picture he had taken with Wei Xiao and them. \u201cThis is a success story of our company. We\u2019ve also collaborated with Qinglian Temple in Diyang\u2026\u2026\u201dQin Yuejian\u2019s first thought upon seeing the group photo was, \u201cHoly f.u.c.k. This is photoshopped, right?\u201dYu Zhengdu scoffed. \u201cWe aren\u2019t celebrities, so we don\u2019t need to photoshop our pictures. We\u2019re naturally good looking, thank you\u2026\u2026\u201dQin Yuejian: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d He didn\u2019t mean photoshop like that.At this time, Shang Que who had remained aloof off to the side suddenly opened his mouth to ask, \u201cThe bracelet on your hand. Who gave it to you?\u201dYu Zhengdu followed Shang Que\u2019s gaze to look at the bracelet around Qin Yuejian\u2019s wrist. It was a silver chain that clearly looked weathered with age. A tiny charm hung off it. From the design, it was very simple, not matching Qin Yuejian\u2019s gaudy celebrity style at all.This bracelet had been on his wrist since Qin Yuejian had debuted. He had never taken it off, not even once. His fans all knew about it, and had even tried to figure out its origins, but n.o.body had uncovered anything yet. Qin Yuejian had also never publicly responded to any questions regarding the bracelet. After enough time, people stopped asking about it.His expression was a bit guarded upon being suddenly questioned about it. He hid his arm behind himself and said, \u201cA friend gave it to me.\u201dYu Zhengdu glanced at Shang Que. \u201cIs there something wrong with this bracelet?\u201dQin Yuejian reacted like an animal that had had its tail stepped on. He immediately denied, \u201cImpossible.\u201dShang Que completely ignored his resistance, only asking, \u201cThe person who gave this bracelet to you has already pa.s.sed, right?\u201dQin Yuejian froze. n.o.body knew the history of his bracelet, so naturally n.o.body would know the story behind it. Then how did Shang Que find out?He was a bit out of it as he stuttered, \u201cHow did you know?\u201dShang Que lowered his gaze to look at the bracelet. He lightly said, \u201cThere is an inextinguishable hint of obsession on this bracelet.\u201dThe hint of obsession was very faint; so faint that until the incident had occurred, even he hadn\u2019t managed to detect it.But it was also very stubborn. Stubborn to the point that it had managed to save Qin Yuejian in such a dangerous situation, then tried to seek revenge and pushed the worker off the elevated surface.Qin Yuejian was confused. \u201cWhat is that?\u201dYu Zhengdu didn\u2019t fully understand everything either, but he managed to take note of the key phrase. He instantly clapped and said, \u201cWas everything caused by the ghost of a dead human? That\u2019s easy to deal with. We can just send a message and check out the situation.\u201dQin Yuejian turned to look at him, even more bewildered, \u201cWhat?\u201dYu Zhengdu very professionally clicked open the product description page on their company\u2019s website and introduced, \u201cThis is another service our company offers\u2014\u2014across-realm communication. We make it possible for you to contact the Underworld, ensuring harmony and peace between the realms of the living and dead.\u201dQin Yuejian: \u201c\u2026\u2026????\u201dThe author has something to say:Zhengdu: Me, professional and dedicated.

    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41 - Cause of ObsessionPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 41 - Cause of ObsessionQin Yuejian\u2019s expression was that of someone who had just met a scammer. Yu Zhengdu was used to it. He very professionally pulled out their company\u2019s product descriptions and explained them to him. Then, he seriously promised, \u201cOur company\u2019s principle is to do business with sincerity. If we aren\u2019t successful, we won\u2019t charge you. This way, you won\u2019t have to worry about being tricked.\u201dQin Yuejian: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe other\u2019s att.i.tude was extremely genuine, but the business he was talking about was so\u2026\u2026random was the way to describe it.While he was in the middle of debating with himself, Shang Que suddenly said, \u201cThe person who gifted the bracelet to you must have liked you a lot, right?\u201dQin Yuejian\u2019s eyes instantly widened. An almost undetectable hint of excitement filled his voice. \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d\u201cIt means no harm to you, but will definitely harm those who seek to hurt you.\u201d Shang Que stared at the bracelet, expression unchanging. However, indescribable emotions flitted through his eyes. \u201cIf you don\u2019t deal with it now, sooner or later it will kill those around you\u2026\u2026for example, the person who tied your safety harness on today.\u201dQin Yuejian froze. He asked, \u201c\u2026\u2026Wasn\u2019t that guy\u2019s fall an accident?\u201dShang Que glanced at him and didn\u2019t answer. His gaze was filled with a message that didn\u2019t need to be spoken aloud.Instead, it was Yu Zhengdu who managed to infer something. After pondering a bit, he asked, \u201cI\u2019m guessing that today wasn\u2019t the first time situations like that have occurred?\u201dWith this mention, Qin Yuejian couldn\u2019t help but start recalling everything that had happened in the past. Upon thinking about them in more detail, he discovered that things were exactly as Yu Zhengdu implied. Every time an accident had occurred to him previously, as long as the accident was caused by a human, that person would suffer some sort of harm. Only, in the past, all the incidents had been small. At most, the other would trip and sc.r.a.pe a knee or something, making it hard to decipher if they were truly accidents or caused by something else.Except now that similar occurrences had happened more than once, he was forced to start feeling suspicious.Qin Yuejian\u2019s heart felt like it was getting squeezed. He reflexively answered, \u201cImpossible. He was a really good person. He would never hurt others.\u201dShang Que explained, \u201cThis is only his obsession, not his person. No matter who the one you\u2019re talking about it is, or what he was like when alive, those have no relation to this situation.\u201dHis tone got slightly frostier. \u201cObsession is mindless. It can\u2019t decipher anything; it can only stubbornly take care of the people or things it thinks will harm you.\u201dQin Yuejian instinctively looked at his own wrist. His gaze was filled with confusion. \u201cBut why would things become like this\u2026\u2026\u201dIf it wasn\u2019t his person, why would his obsession be trapped on this bracelet?Yu Zhengdu looked at Shang Que curiously too. Shang Que only shook his head. \u201cWe would have to know who that person was.\u201dThe truth was laid out in front of him. Qin Yuejian disregarded whether or not he truly believed in superst.i.tions and decided he wanted to try. Of course, in his heart, maybe he had other thoughts that remained hidden to others.Qin Yuejian became silent for a moment. Then, he finally spat out the name that his fans and the media had searched for extensively but never uncovered: \u201cHis name was Zhan Keji. He was my high school cla.s.smate.\u201dYu Zhengdu immediately formulated a message and sent it back to Luofeng\u2019s headquarters. He asked Kang Jin to help him find this person\u2019s information. Kang Jin replied fairly quickly, but the response only perplexed him more.According to the records in the Life and Death Account, Zhan Keji really had already died. But because his obsession couldn\u2019t be removed, he couldn\u2019t be scheduled for reincarnation.Yu Zhengdu furrowed his brows. \u201cI can\u2019t find his current location either.\u201dQin Yuejian had originally been tense with antic.i.p.ation. Upon hearing this, he couldn\u2019t help but reveal a doubtful expression. However, Shang Que didn\u2019t seem surprised at all. He lightly said, \u201cHis obsession and his spirit have been separated, so hasn\u2019t been able to dissipatek2026;k2026;the most probable thing that occurred was his obsession was exorcised forcefully. This wasn\u2019t what he wanted, so he trapped his spirit in the place his obsession started.\u201dQin Yuejian could only understand half of what he was saying, but his heart still felt like it was being squeezed. He subconsciously s.h.i.+fted forward a bit. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201dShang Que lifted his gaze to look at him. \u201cHow did he die?\u201dQin Yuejian paused, then became silent. A while later, he finally answered with difficulty, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen I found out, he had already died. I found his parents to try and ask about it, but they refused to tell me anything. And\u2026\u2026after he pa.s.sed, his family immediately moved away. I didn\u2019t even manage to see him one last time\u2026\u2026I didn\u2019t even get to see his body\u2026\u2026\u201dIt seemed that Qin Yuejian hadn\u2019t mentioned these events in a while. As he spoke, he occasionally needed to take breaks to refresh his memory. His voice trembled slightly. Though he didn\u2019t say much, it seemed like he had used a lot of energy. In the end, he looked at Shang Que. \u201cCould it be\u2026\u2026could it be that there are secrets about his death?\u201dShang Que shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201dQin Yuejian suddenly became agitated. \u201cYou guys are lying to me, right? You made up the bit about obsessions, right? He found peace a long time ago, how could it be\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu sat off to the side silently. While listening to Qin Yuejian speak, he also pondered. At this time, he finally found a key point in the unclear information provided and randomly piped up. \u201cWait. Zhan Keji was male, right?\u201dQin Yuejian didn\u2019t know why he was suddenly bringing this up, so reflexively nodded.Yu Zhengdu\u2019s face was filled with a hint of realization. \u201cHe was male, he liked you\u2026\u2026he was gay?\u201dQin Yuejian\u2019s face immediately flushed red. A moment later, he asked, voice tight, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with being gay?\u201d\u201cNothing,\u201d Yu Zhengdu responded. His tone was natural, like he was discussing an average topic of conversation. But just this simple word allowed for Qin Yuejian\u2019s tense nerves to instantly relax.Shang Que couldn\u2019t help turning his head to look at Yu Zhengdu. It was unclear what he had suddenly thought of.Qin Yuejian almost subconsciously stroked the chain on his wrist. He muttered, \u201cHe was gay, but what does that have to do with anything?\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201cOf course it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with anything. But what did the people around him, especially his family, think about his s.e.xuality?\u201dQin Yuejian shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dHe really didn\u2019t know. When Zhan Keji had been alive, he had never introduced him to his parents. After Zhan Keji had pa.s.sed, his parents also weren\u2019t willing to communicate with Qin Yuejian.From beginning to end, Qin Yuejian didn\u2019t know what had happened with Zhan Keji.And now, if the two people before him weren\u2019t lying and Zhan Keji\u2019s spirit really was lost somewhere, then\u2026\u2026wouldn\u2019t he never be able to learn the truth?Uncontrollably, Qin Yuejian\u2019s eyes turned slightly red. His lips trembled. \u201cIf the dead really have spirits, can you help me find him?\u201dShang Que said, \u201cIf we can find where his cause of obsession is, then yes.\u201dQin Yuejian was dazed. \u201cCause of obsession?\u201d He had just barely figured out what obsession was. How was he supposed to know what the cause of obsession was?Only to see Yu Zhengdu glance at his wrist knowingly, \u201cHis obsession is with you.\u201dA thought flashed through Qin Yuejian\u2019s mind. In a moment of realization, he asked, \u201cIs it that place?\u201d***The place Qin Yuejian spoke of was the high school that he and Zhan Keji had both attended. That was where the two of them had met, and was also the place where they had spent the most time together.Qin Yuejian and Zhan Keji had sat next to each other for three years. They had once promised to go to the same university together, but right before the gaokao , the news that Zhan Keji had died was suddenly announced by his family.After hearing this, Qin Yuejian had run over to the Zhan home. He wanted to see Zhan Keji\u2019s body one last time, but was coldly rejected by Mother and Father Zhan. The next time he visited, they had already moved away.High school campuses had curfew. Qin Yuejian was also a popular idol, so he didn\u2019t dare to appear at school in the day. Thus, at night, Qin Yuejian brought Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que over to the wall by the field and familiarly flipped inside.\u201cBack then, Keji and I were both boarders. We were right at the age where we were growing and got hungry easily. At night, when we were so hungry we couldn\u2019t take it, we would secretly sneak over the walls to get a midnight snack.\u201d As Qin Yuejian spoke to them, his tone was light, but Yu Zhengdu could tell that there was a hint of reminiscence hidden in there. \u201cIn the beginning, I wasn\u2019t very good at flipping the fence. He would squat and help me over by letting me step on his back.\u201dNow, it was already past the time for evening self-study. The students had already left and the lights in the cla.s.srooms were all off. Only a few street lights dimly lit up the night. They swayed with the wind.Qin Yuejian led Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que over to the building he had had cla.s.s in before. They walked up the stairs and suddenly heard a girl\u2019s voice. \u201cLet\u2019s go back. I heard there are ghosts here at night.\u201dA male\u2019s voice responded, \u201cDon\u2019t be scared. I\u2019m here.\u201dIt appeared to be a young couple secretly out on a date.The girl still seemed a bit frightened. \u201cI heard the student who got held back a year from the cla.s.s next door say that one time, after self-study time, he came over to grab something and saw someone writing at the desk. But when he walked closer, the person disappeared. He thought that he had seen wrong at first, but there happened to be a notebook open on the desk. Then, he saw that it looked like someone had written on the notebook.\u2026\u2026\u201dThe boy scoffed. \u201cThose indentations were probably already there before\u2026\u2026\u201dGirl: \u201cNo, he specially double-checked. They didn\u2019t match the handwriting already in the notebook\u2026\u2026\u201dThe boy teased, \u201cWell what was written on it?\u201dGirl: \u201cApparently it was incomplete. There was only half a sentence. It read, \u2018Qin Yuejian, be with\u2019\u2026\u2026\u201dGuy: \u201cf.u.c.k. So at the end of the day, a fangirl wrote it, right. Even mentioning Qin Yuejian\u2026\u2026\u201dGirl: \u201cGhosts can be fangirls too. Besides, have you forgotten? Qin Yuejian graduated from our school.\u201dThe boy immediately changed the topic. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, just hold onto me. As long as I\u2019m here, there\u2019s no need to be scared even if there really are ghosts.\u201dThe three people forced to eavesdrop: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d After all this time, this was the real reason the guy was determined to visit this haunted cla.s.sroom, right.What a sly boy!Yu Zhengdu lowly cussed at the male student, then turned to glance at Qin Yuejian, only to see a look of disbelief on the other\u2019s face. His eyes were bright with antic.i.p.ation. In the face of a potential customer,Yu Zhengdu was rather professional, so immediately said, \u201cYou guys hide first. I\u2019ll make those two leave.\u201dYu Zhengdu\u2019s method of getting people to leave was simple but effective. He directly took out his phone and played a sound recording.The evening wind howled. Suddenly, a bout of wailing sounded out, carrying with it an indescribable feeling of cold and eeriness.The girl had originally been scared already. Upon hearing this, her face immediately paled. The boy had sounded so brave previously; who would\u2019ve thought, then, that after noticing this low grumble that didn\u2019t sound like a noise a human could make, he became so scared that he yelped and ran away even faster than the girl.Yu Zhengdu had unexpectedly helped the girl realize the unreliable true nature of this male student. It was an extra achievement.Only to see Qin Yuejian\u2019s expression turn conflicted. He asked, \u201cYour ghost wails are too realistic. Where did you download them from?\u201dYu Zhengdu shook his head and sighed. \u201cI recorded my coworker.\u201dQin Yuejian: \u201c\u2026\u2026???\u201d The employees at their company were that good at mimicking noises?After scaring away two students and successfully preventing a badly timed premature couple, the three of them finally arrived in the cla.s.sroom Qin Yuejian had spent most of his time at before.Their surroundings were pitch dark. Only the sound of the wind could be heard.Qin Yuejian turned on the lights in the cla.s.sroom with a \u201cpa\u201d . The room was immediately illuminated, revealing its emptiness.But in Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que\u2019s eyes, a male with short hair and dressed in a loose blue school uniform was very clearly sprawled against the desk in the second to last row of the cla.s.sroom, head down as he wrote.Yu Zhengdu pointed in the direction of the boy and inquired Qin Yuejian, \u201cThat must\u2019ve been your seat, right?\u201dQin Yuejian asked in shock, \u201cHow did you know?\u201dYu Zhengdu\u2019s gaze was heavy. \u201cI see him.\u201dQin Yuejian instantly became excited. He was just about to ask for more information, only to see Yu Zhengdu pull out a phone, turn on the camera, and stick it in front of his nose. \u201cThe product you\u2019re looking at now is the ghost imaging technology developed by our company. It uses an extra large F1.7 brightness setting and has a 30 million pixel resolution. It can effectively eliminate white noise to make the clearest image. Here, experience it.\u201dQin Yuejian: \u201c\u2026\u2026??\u201dThe author has something to say:The image of a technological company can\u2019t be ruined!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42 - Nonprofitable ProductPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 42 - Nonprofitable ProductZhan Keji was tall and lean. His appearance was youthful, his hair kept short and neat, revealing a tiny pimple on his forehead.Without the help of outside forces, normal ghosts would maintain the way they looked at their time of death.Zhan Keji\u2019s spirit would always be frozen at eighteen years old.He lowered his head and sprawled on the desk, right hand maintaining the posture of holding onto a pen. He was writing something slowly, expression dismal.Qin Yuejian had originally still been suspicious about the ghost imaging technology Yu Zhengdu spoke of, but after seeing the scene in the camera, he became completely shocked. A loud \u201cf.u.c.k\u201d escaped him. \u201cWhat kind of black technology is this?\u201dYu Zhengdu modestly smiled, \u201cPatented.\u201dQin Yuejian didn\u2019t dwell on this matter for too long. For him, being able to see Zhan Keji again was the most important thing. The emotions he had struggled to hold back the entire evening completely broke free. He couldn\u2019t help but shout, \u201cKeji!\u201d\u201cZhan Keji, I\u2019ve come to look for you!\u201dBut the boy sitting at the desk showed no reaction. He maintained his original posture, carefully writing stroke after stroke.Qin Yuejian felt both excited and nervous. He glanced at Yu Zhengdu, bewildered. \u201cCan\u2019t he hear me?\u201dYu Zhengdu didn\u2019t understand either; he could only look to Shang Que for answers. Shang Que had his eyes lowered. He watched as the youth robotically repeated the same movement over and over, then said, \u201cHe has no consciousness.\u201dHis gaze fell on the chain around Qin Yuejian\u2019s wrist. \u201cHe was forcefully separated from his obsession. Under normal circ.u.mstances, the obsession should dissipate by itself naturally. His soul should have been able to release the past and head for reincarnation too\u2026\u2026\u201dPerhaps, though, Zhan Keji\u2019s obsession had been too strong and too persistent. In the end, it didn\u2019t disappear, but made its way to the side of the person he couldn\u2019t let go of.Because his obsession still existed, his spirit couldn\u2019t completely forget the events of the past either, so couldn\u2019t reincarnate. Yet for some reason, Zhan Keji\u2019s soul didn\u2019t follow his obsession to Qin Yuejian\u2019s side, but stayed here instead.Not only this, but obsessions were a part of the consciousness. Forcefully separating the two caused his soul to become incomplete. Consequently, Zhan Keji\u2019s spirit transformed into the way it was now. Without a whole consciousness, he could only repeat the same actions over and over again to try and accomplish his unaccomplished desires.Yu Zhengdu was struck with a sudden realization. he rubbed his hands together and started summarizing, \u201cI get it. This is just like deleting data. Originally, after formatting, it became a brand new hard drive. But his numbers are extremely stubborn, just like those virus softwares. You can never delete them completely and they eventually escape to other places too.\u201dShang Que: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d He\u2019s started his scientific summaries again!Qin Yuejian had a conflicted expression on his face too\u2026\u2026His words sounded right, but also sounded wrong somehow.Yu Zhengdu didn\u2019t pay attention to the way the other two looked like they wanted to say something but didn\u2019t dare to. His gaze landed on Zhan Keji\u2019s hand and he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s he writing?\u201dShang Que: \u201cWe\u2019ll know after taking a look.\u201dYu Zhengdu shamelessly asked, \u201cHow would we take a look?\u201dShang Que: \u201cBy throwing ash on it.\u201dYu Zhengdu understood. This was the same principle as scattering ashes to view ghostly tracks. As long as the other was a ghost, in theory, Zhan Keji\u2019s words should appear after being covered with ash. But the problem was\u2026\u2026He tsk\u2019d and held his hands out. \u201cWe don\u2019t have incense ash.\u201d With their employee benefits, they could directly see ghosts. Besides, they used high tech ways of removing evil, so never carried such materials with them on trips.Shang Que made a noise of acknowledgment. \u201cNo matter. What he\u2019s writing has no relation to what we\u2019re about to do.\u201dOnly to see Yu Zhengdu suddenly pause and inquire, \u201cDid you bring your pen?\u201dShang Que: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Honestly speaking, he oftentimes needed to sign papers for the employees of Luofeng. The pen he used truly was an Underworld pen.He held up his hand; in it, a pen had somehow appeared. It was unclear where it had come from.Upon seeing this, Qin Yuejian\u2019s face became filled with disdain. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean to give him your pen to write with\u2026\u2026Quit playing\u2026\u2026\u201dBefore he finished speaking, Yu Zhengdu had already sneakily stuffed the pen into Zhan Keji\u2019s hand. There was already an open notebook on the table.Qin Yuejian watched through the lens as Zhan Keji held onto Shang Que\u2019s signing pen and continued his original actions. And then, on the piece of paper, a small line of words slowly appeared.Qin Yuejian exploded, \u201cThis is your technology too?\u201d\u201cNo no no,\u201d Yu Zhengdu stated modestly. \u201cJust your average office supplies. Nonprofitable.\u201dQin Yuejian: \u201ck2026;k2026;\u201dHis shock made him speechless, but he had no time to think too hard on it. For him, Zhan Keji was more important.The boy sprawled on the table didn\u2019t realize anything was going on around him. He continued writing, stroke by stroke.Yu Zhengdu rubbed his hands together: \u201cSo, let us see what he\u2019s writing\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que thought about it, then very seriously answered, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s the pa.s.sword for his credit card?\u201dShocked Yu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dQin Yuejian\u2019s mouth twitched too.But Shang Que seemed to genuinely consider this possibility. \u201cThere are a lot of people in the Underworld who died from accidents before being able to spend all their money. Their biggest regret is that they didn\u2019t tell their credit card pa.s.sword to their families.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d No wonder famous uncle sketch actor once said: The most tragic thing in life is for one to die having failed to spend all their money.Qin Yuejian: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d After thinking about it in more detail, what they\u2019re saying actually makes sense\u2026\u2026Yu Zhengdu very sincerely replied too. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s what this situation is about.\u201dShang Que: \u201cIt might be.\u201dOnly to see the words appear one by one under Zhan Keji\u2019s pen. They combined to form one phrase:\u3010Qin Yuejian, be with me\u2026\u2026okay?\u3011A while later, a new set of words covered the old ones. They repeated over and over again.\u3010Qin Yuejian, be with me\u2026\u2026okay?\u3011Yu Zhengdu reflected upon himself in shame. \u201cWe are ultimately too tasteless.\u201dHis gaze landed on Qin Yuejian. Qin Yuejian was a bit embarra.s.sed. \u201cActually, I knew a long time ago that he liked me\u2026\u2026but\u2026\u2026\u201dHe hadn\u2019t expected that the phrase he had been writing over and over was this one.Qin Yuejian felt like he had returned to the time when Zhan Keji was still alive; a time when they had both been 18. The summer sun was unrelenting yet gentle. It peeked in with slanted rays through the cla.s.sroom window. Zhan Keji never listened to lecture seriously, but really liked to sit at his desk and secretly write things.Qin Yuejian would sometimes get curious and poke his head over to look. Zhan Keji always snapped his notebook shut and c.o.c.ked an eyebrow to ask him, \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201dQin Yuejian would then gently pound him with a fist, \u201cSo mysterious.\u201dZhan Keji would return the favor, then stick his tongue out and make a silly face. One time, he had rested his head against Qin Yuejian\u2019s shoulder and muttered, \u201cThis summer is so long.\u201dQin Yuejian had been melancholic too. \u201cYeah. When will senior year end, I don\u2019t want to study anymore\u2026\u2026\u201dZhan Keji tentatively asked, \u201cLet\u2019s apply for the same school?\u201dQin Yuejian: \u201cShow me what you\u2019re writing and I\u2019ll think about it.\u201d\u201cImpossible.\u201d Zhan Keji looked up at the sky. \u201cAfter we get into the same school, I\u2019ll show you.\u201d\u2026\u2026Zhan Keji never made it to the end of summer. He never got to attend the same university as him, and Qin Yuejian had thought that he would never know what Zhan Keji had been writing.A sour feeling of grief rose in his heart. His emotions weren\u2019t as strong as Zhan Keji\u2019s. All the way until the time before Zhan Keji\u2019s death, he had only been confused, not knowing for sure what he was feeling in his heart. Perhaps because of this, Zhan Keji had never dared to make things too clear between the two of them.And then, everything had been too late.Yu Zhengdu patted his shoulder in soundless comfort.Qin Yuejian instantly returned to his senses. He turned his head to ask, \u201cCan you guys do anything to help him?\u201dShang Que held his hand out. \u201cGive me your bracelet.\u201dQin Yuejian took off his bracelet and handed it over. Shang Que grabbed it in his hand and was just about to start, when he suddenly turned to look at Yu Zhengdu. Upon seeing that the other was watching him too, an idea popped up in his head. He held the bracelet out. \u201cYou try?\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d Yu Zhengdu scratched his head. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know how.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll teach you.\u201d He put the bracelet in Yu Zhengdu\u2019s palm and used his own hand to cover it. They held hands. \u201cI\u2019ll say a line, then you repeat after me.\u201dYu Zhengdu only felt his palm go cold with a temperature that didn\u2019t belong to a living human.A strange thought pa.s.sed through his mind, but immediately dissipated. He only said, \u201cWe look so gay\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que argued, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say there was nothing wrong with being gay?\u201dThat was what Yu Zhengdu had told Qin Yuejian during the day. It was the truth, but wasn\u2019t it a little weird for Boss to mention it at a time like this?Yu Zhengdu didn\u2019t have time to dwell on this, because Shang Que had already started chanting, \u201cThe living are guests.\u201dHe could only hurriedly erase all other thoughts from his mind and repeat, \u201cThe living are guests.\u201dShang Que: \u201cThe dead shall return.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201cThe dead shall return.\u201dShang Que: \u201cSpirits a thousand li away.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201cSpirits a thousand li away.\u201dShang Que: \u201cReturn to this world.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201cReturn to this world.\u201dAs the last sounds of their chanting rang out, Yu Zhengdu felt his hand grow cold. Shang Que let go and Yu Zhengdu saw that the silver chain and charm originally in their hands had turned into powder. The evening wind blew in, sweeping it onto the desk and floor.But nothing happened to the youth by the table. He maintained his original position, slowly writing.Qin Yuejian felt like someone was squeezing his heart. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work?\u201dYu Zhengdu shook his head, then turned to look at Shang Que. Shang Que lowered his gaze to glance at the desk. \u201cWe\u2019re missing something still\u2026\u2026\u201dQin Yuejian: \u201cWhat?\u201dShang Que said, \u201cHis obsession has yet to be fulfilled.\u201dQin Yuejian was bewildered, \u201cBut\u2026\u2026how should we fulfill it?\u201dShang Que shook his head. \u201cPerhaps only he knows the answer to that.\u201dSurprisingly, Yu Zhengdu laughed. \u201cHis obsession\u2026\u2026Isn\u2019t it very obvious?\u201dQin Yuejian turned to look at the desk, heart beating erratically in his chest. He reached a hand out and gently caressed the words on the paper. Those words were still appearing, overlapping with each other.\u3010Qin Yuejian, be with me\u2026\u2026okay?\u3011Qin Yuejian\u2019s voice was extremely low. He seemed to be replying to Zhan Keji, but also to himself.He said, \u201cOkay.\u201dBy the desk, the youth who had been continuously repeating the same move over and over suddenly stopped. He paused, then slowly raised his head. His dark, dull eyes that no longer contained the light of life were filled with confusion and doubt. A long pause later, he finally regained his wits. He looked around and asked, \u201cYi? Why am I in the cla.s.sroom? Who are you guys?\u201dYu Zhengdu finally released the breath stuck in his chest. He smiled and held a hand out in greeting. \u201ch.e.l.lo cla.s.smate.\u201dQin Yuejian excitedly said from through the lens, \u201cZhan Keji, you\u2019ve finally regained consciousness! Look at me, hurry, look at me!\u201dZhang Keji was in the middle of shaking Yu Zhengdu\u2019s hand, bewildered. At this time, he finally realized that something was wrong. He forcefully turned around to look at Qin Yuejian and shouted in shock, \u201cQin Yuejian? It\u2019s you? How come you\u2019ve suddenly aged so much?\u201dQin Yuejian: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d I\u2019m a little angry now!Yu Zhengdu calmly patted Zhan Keji\u2019s shoulder. \u201cCla.s.smate, it\u2019s already the year 8102.\u201dZhan Keji who was four generations behind on Internet slang: \u201c\u2026\u2026What??\u201d Six thousand years had pa.s.sed since he last opened his eyes?Yu Zhengdu saw his bewildered expression and sweated. He hurriedly explained, \u201cI mean, 2018\u2026\u2026\u201dZhan Keji: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d He still didn\u2019t understand.\u2026\u2026Zhan Keji\u2019s soul had been incomplete for too long, so he was dazed for a while after regaining consciousness. His reactions were quite slow. After speaking with Qin Yuejian, he finally recalled the events of the past.Including the fact that he was already dead.\u201cI\u2019m surprised that so much time has pa.s.sed,\u201d Zhan Keji sighed. He looked at Qin Yuejian and teased, \u201cLao Qin is even a celebrity now. Not bad ah. You must have a lot of little girl fans, right?\u201dQin Yuejian really wanted to punch him, but sadly could only glare at him through the phone screen. He pouted and said, \u201cWhy do you have so much useless stuff to say?\u201dThough Yu Zhengdu was also happy that these two best friends could reunite, he couldn\u2019t help but b.u.t.t in at this critical time to remind them, \u201cHurry and get to the point you guys. The phone\u2019s almost out of batteries.\u201dQin Yuejian finally realized the most horrifying thing of the evening: the battery percentage of the ghost imaging phone that Luofeng had provided was only at 10%.He immediately complained: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you completely charge it?\u201dYu Zhengdu was very innocent. \u201cMainly because I hadn\u2019t expected you guys to be so talkative.\u201dQin Yuejian: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThough there was still a lot he wanted to say to Zhan Keji, there were more important things to deal with now. He hurriedly asked, \u201cKeji, why did you suddenly die back then?\u201dZhan Keji had been happily chatting previously, but after hearing this question, his expression changed and he remained silent.Qin Yuejian was extremely unsatisfied and confused by the occurrences of the past. Upon seeing this, he urged, \u201cSay something.\u201dZhang Keji turned to look at him. \u201cNothing. It was an accident.\u201dYu Zhengdu patted him on the shoulder, tone heavy. \u201cCla.s.smate Zhan, people about to die should speak the truth. Besides, you\u2019ve already been dead for so long, but still try to hide things. There\u2019s really no need.\u201dZhan Keji: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dQin Yuejian suddenly added, \u201cWas it related to me?\u201dZhan Keji looked up at him, surprise evident in his eyes.At this critical moment, Yu Zhengdu handed a notebook to him. \u201cYou already bravely wrote it out, so there\u2019s no need to hide it anymore.\u201dZhan Keji: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dQin Yuejian\u2019s face was filled with admiration. \u201cYour company is truly amazing. You even have stationary that ghosts can use.\u201d\u201cEy, there are just products off to the side. They aren\u2019t our main technologies,\u201d Yu Zhengdu expressed humbly. \u201cYou two chat first. After, I\u2019ll send you the entire product description list for our company.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43 - Stupidity Exits the CirclePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 43 - Stupidity Exits the CircleT/N: To explain the t.i.tle, the \u201ccircle\u201d refers to a fandom; in Chinese, fandoms are called \u996d\u5708, which literally translates to fan circle.Yu Zhengdu\u2019s words caused Zhan Keji to return to his senses. He was already dead and his biggest secret from when alive had already been exposed. He realized that his ghostly life was already bare, so there was nothing left to hide.Of course, the most important thing was, Qin Yuejian knew about his thoughts, but didn\u2019t seem to oppose them. This allowed him to feel much more relieved.Zhan Keji reminisced in detail before slowly sharing the reason for his sudden death.It turned out that right before the university entrance exam, his parents had inadvertently discovered that he was h.o.m.os.e.xual and liked a male cla.s.smate in his cla.s.s.Zhan Keji\u2019s family was conservative and strict. They were unable to accept their son\u2019s s.e.xual orientation, so locked him up at home. Upon seeing that he had no intentions to change whatsoever, they sent him to a private doctor who claimed to be able to cure such illnesses. The methods of the private clinic were extremely cruel; aside from nonstop subliminal messaging, they even used physical \u201ctherapy\u201d.Zhan Keji had a mental breakdown after a particularly tormenting round of forced therapy. He broke free from the bonds of the clinic and ran away, but in the escape process, had fallen to his death after slipping while flipping over the iron fence.But the tragedy didn\u2019t end there. Even Zhan Keji hadn\u2019t expected that after his death, his parents would consider that he hadn\u2019t cured his \u201cmental illness\u201d yet. Thus, they specially hired an experienced monk to hold a ceremony and release his obsessions.Zhan Keji couldn\u2019t really remember this process anymore. The only thing he could remember was that in that moment, his desire to stay in the world and his feelings towards his parents reached an all-time low. The one thought that still resonated strongly was that he wanted to see Qin Yuejian again. Everything after that was a mystery to him too.Qin Yuejian had guessed that Zhan Keji\u2019s sudden death was possibly related to him, but hadn\u2019t expected the process to be so tragic. After hearing Zhan Keji\u2019s words, his eyes became red.Yu Zhengdu couldn\u2019t help but scoff, \u201cSome parents do things in the name of loving their children, but in the end, they only really care about themselves.\u201dIn the time he had suffered such inhumane treatment, Zhan Keji had long since used up all the positive emotions he had towards his parents. After hearing this, he didn\u2019t even feel anything. He only gently laughed and mocked himself, \u201cRight. They think that just because they gave me life they can control my life. But I\u2019m dead now, so I don\u2019t owe them anything.\u201dQin Yuejian\u2019s eyes were bright red. He wanted to say something, but couldn\u2019t.Yu Zhengdu patted his shoulder. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything else you two want to say, hurry and say it.\u201dQin Yuejian immediately became agitated. \u201cKeji can\u2019t be with me from now on?\u201dZhan Keji hadn\u2019t thought that Qin Yuejian would say this. His eyes instantly lit up, but his antic.i.p.ations were very quickly slammed to the ground. Shang Que very simply stated, \u201cHumans and ghosts have their own paths.\u201dYu Zhengdu nodded and added, \u201cThe Underworld has its own rules. He needs to report to the Underworld now, otherwise, he\u2019ll not only harm you but also himself.\u201dThe supposed concept of \u201c Yin and Yang are different, humans and ghosts have their own paths\u201d was one easy to understand even without further explanation. But regardless of whether it was Qin Yuejian or Zhan Keji, neither were willing to accept this.Especially Qin Yuejian. After learning that Zhan Keji\u2019s death was more or less related to him, and after learning that after death, his obsession had stayed by his side for so long, silently protecting him, the two of them had finally confessed to each other after much difficulty. Now that they would be forced to separate again, he was almost tempted to seek death too.At this crucial moment, Qin Yuejian suddenly came up with a thought. He turned to stare at Yu Zhengdu. \u201cDoesn\u2019t your company have that cross-realm communication service? I\u2019ll pay for an entire year\u2019s!\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026Wow, as expected from a celebrity. Rich and willing to spend money.\u201dThus, Yu Zhengdu calculated. The time it would take for Zhan Keji to completely let go of his obsession would probably be quite long, so they could accept Qin Yuejian\u2019s request for a year of cross-realm communication.But that wasn\u2019t all. Yu Zhengdu also took this opportunity to sell their company\u2019s entire service package to Qin Yuejian, including scheduled sacrifices for Zhan Keji, luck-changing jade stones, Underworld energy detection, and more.Because the communication service between the Underworld and mortal realm still needed Luofeng\u2019s employees as middlemen in order to avoid revealing Heavenly secrets, to express how much they valued their VIP-entire-year customer, Yu Zhengdu specially set up a private customer service line for Qin Yuejian.Right now, Qin Yuejian was beyond impressed by Luofeng\u2019s technology. Not only did he buy the complete service package, he also gave them his email and told them to send him the summary of Luofeng\u2019s new products every quarter so he wouldn\u2019t miss anything.And he was pretty good at socializing. He very readily agreed to Yu Zhengdu\u2019s hints of asking him to recommend their company\u2019s products to his friends in the entertainment industry.The entertainment industry was famous for being a gold mine. The people in it were rich and superst.i.tious. As long as they could develop a group of customers in this area, they would definitely earn an immense profit.The following two days, Yu Zhengdu was in a great mood. Even the speed at which he wrote code got faster.But his happiness didn\u2019t get to last very long before their company\u2019s group chat exploded.Shang Que got onto the trending list.And because of Qin Yuejian\u2019s fans.***During the \u201cPalpitating Youth\u201d livestream, several of Qin Yuejian\u2019s fans had been watching. However, they hadn\u2019t antic.i.p.ated that there would be the incident with jumping across the boards in midair. In the end, although they luckily managed to avoid irreparable consequences, fans were still extremely worried. They cussed out Big Eye Livestream for several days after, causing a huge commotion online. It took Big Eye Livestream\u2019s public apology and sincere comforting plus compensation, along with Qin Yuejian saying that he wouldn\u2019t be pursuing this issue, for things to finally calm down.Who knew that after all this, Shang Que would become the center of attention.The reason was because a Weibo account famous for posting stupid content accidentally noticed Shang Que through this incident. They cut out Shang Que\u2019s behavior in the activities and made a solo compilation video, t.i.tling it \u201cSteel Will CEO\u201d and posting it. Unexpectedly, the video quickly went viral, getting reposted by promotional accounts.Almost overnight, this video clip had been reposted by everyone online.This was mainly because Shang Que\u2019s behavior truly shocked netizens greatly. In recent years, variety shows in the country had rapidly become popular. There was an abundance of them, regardless of if they were compet.i.tion-focused or outdoor activity-focused. The audience were already more than familiar with how guests acted on these shows.Which guest wouldn\u2019t be crying and shouting, face twisted in pain, after stepping onto the acupressure mat?Who didn\u2019t try their hardest, winning based off weight and strength, during the b.u.mping compet.i.tion?Only Shang Que was expressionless in front of the camera, as if he had lost his soul. This made netizens very seriously wonder if all the variety shows they had watched in the past were fake?But it was exactly this soulless behavior that had let him easily emerge victorious in the end.Especially that last collision during the b.u.mping game. The tall guy in Qin Yuejian\u2019s team was truly well endowed and practically invincible. While Shang Que was quite tall, he was much thinner than the other; in comparison, he didn\u2019t look like he could stand a chance.Who would\u2019ve thought. The result was that the tall guy had been sent flying, instantly cras.h.i.+ng into the ground.The original uploader had even selected a particularly intense song to use as the background music. They also used the last scene of Shang Que turning around, bewildered, and added special effects to make it a meme. Along with the words \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d, the final product was much more interesting and successfully caused netizens to fall over laughing.Thus, Shang Que became famous overnight due to this short, two minute video. Netizens called him an emotionless game machine, a steel-willed CEO that people didn\u2019t know whether or not to cla.s.sify as a clear stream or a muddy stream .This originally wasn\u2019t a big deal. In the age of the Internet, numerous people suddenly became viral and then disappeared just as quickly. The problem was, after Shang Que exited the circle because of the stupid video, he garnered a large group of fans because of his appearance.The video\u2019s popularity attracted an abundance of netizens who went to watch. But in the end, the video comments were all filled with compliments about Shang Que\u2019s beauty.\u3010I was attracted here by the stupidity, and now I\u2019m stuck\u2026\u2026I can stare at CEO\u2019s face until next year\u3011\u3010This little gege is a little too good-looking. He\u2019s so good-looking and so funny, I\u2019m in love, in love\u3011\u3010An audience member present at the filming of the livestream wants to say, I originally went to watch because of Qin Yuejian, but in the end I was mesmerized by CEO\u3011More and more similar comments appeared, especially from those who had watched the livestream on the day it had broadcast. Many expressed in the comments below that they had thought Qin Yuejian would\u2019ve been the best looking person on set; who would\u2019ve expected that everyone\u2019s attention got caught by Shang Que instead. Some also included Yu Zhengdu, expressing that their pairing was that of G.o.dly appearances. Only, Shang Que\u2019s behavior in the games later on was more fascinating, so in the end, he gained quite a few fans.These comments caused a large number of Qin Yuejian\u2019s fans to become furious.Qin Yuejian had debuted off a survival show. Many of his fans had been with him from the start and watched him grow, so were extremely loyal. They were also good at arguing. A majority spent a lot of their time in several big fandoms, so were skilled at navigating the rules of fandom culture.For them, Qin Yuejian was the guest star on \u201cPalpitating Youth\u201d and the one who attracted a large amount of audience members for the show. In the end, though, not only did he almost get in an accident, the benefits from attending had all been taken by Shang Que. Additionally, many of his opponents had also taken this opportunity to attack him, borrowing Shang Que\u2019s sudden popularity to imply that Qin Yuejian\u2019s appearance was just so-so.Qin Yuejian\u2019s fans had fought with the fans of other idols who had debuted around the same time several times throughout the survival show. Under these circ.u.mstances, there were naturally some who refused to sit back and watch. They stepped out to cuss out the production team and Shang Que.First, some fans a.n.a.lyzed the situation from several different angles. They came to the conclusion that this show in its entirety had just been a plot to allow Shang Que to debut. The production team knew of this long ago, so found Qin Yuejian to guest star in order to help Shang Que along.Their reasoning was that Shang Que\u2019s behavior in this show was completely illogical. Some fans even specially created a detailed picture a.n.a.lysis of the force-capacity of the acupressure mats. This provided evidence that it was impossible for Shang Que to not have any reaction whatsoever, unless he wasn\u2019t human.The b.u.mping game was the same. Fans who were also physics majors calculated the force of the last collision based on tall guy\u2019s height, weight, and charging speed. Though Shang Que hadn\u2019t publicly shared his weight, these amazing fans managed to estimate it based on comparisons with other guests present that day. They used his height and body shape to deduce his weight. The conclusion they swore by was the same as the previous one: unless Shang Que wasn\u2019t human, there was no way he could\u2019ve caused tall guy to go flying.Thus, things were obvious. It was definitely the production team plotting in the shadows, changing things with Shang Que so that he could have this effect after going on the show.Qin Yuejian\u2019s fans pa.s.sionately complained, but couldn\u2019t stop Shang Que\u2019s video from getting more and more popular. After all, netizens didn\u2019t care whether or not the video had been edited, as long as it made them laugh.And in the eyes of appearance fans, the fact that Shang Que\u2019s face truly existed was enough for them.Qin Yuejian\u2019s fans didn\u2019t achieve the results they expected, so became even more furious. They started working together to expose all of Shang Que\u2019s information. This exposure process really revealed some things.\u3010Did everyone see the exposed information? CEO used his fake account to cuss out the production team of Old Dreams of Bianliang in the past. He even complained about the second male lead that Qin Yuejian played\u3011\u3010Can I say that I\u2019m not surprised at all? This drama queen very clearly wants to step on gege to get to the top. This is just evidence of that\u3011\u3010Am I the only one who noticed CEO\u2019s username is \u201cFrom Today On I Will Be A European G.o.d \u201d? What stupid username is this\u2026\u2026\u3011It turned out that fans had discovered Shang Que\u2019s Weibo account, \u201cFrom Today On I Will Be A European G.o.d\u201d, and discovered that he had complained about the entire drama Old Dreams of Bianliang while it had still been airing. From the plot, background, to characters, none were spared from his criticisms. Among these, he had complained about the second male lead that Qin Yuejian had played the most.This time, Qin Yuejian\u2019s fans finally found a point of entry. If their previous idea of Shang Que stepping on Qin Yuejian to get famous was simply based off groundless accusations, now they had found true and convincing evidence.Not only this, but the entire production team of Old Dreams of Bianliang had been mentioned too.This drama was originally a historical idol drama and not a true historical drama. In comparison to other similar productions, this drama had been of better quality. Its ratings were generally good, so the fans of the lead actors considered this drama something to be proud of.If Shang Que were only an invisible n.o.body, nothing would\u2019ve happened. Unfortunately, he was right in the midst of conflict now; several gossip accounts had their eyes on him. Upon seeing such promising news, they immediately started reporting on it.The criticisms on his account covered so many different aspects. From plot to customs, rituals, dress, all the way until each actor\u2019s performance, he complained about all of them. It was almost as if the entire drama was made of bugs . Regardless of if they liked the drama or the lead actors, fans couldn\u2019t stand it.\u3010I\u2019m dying. Who does this person think he is, a historical scholar?\u3011\u3010The scriptwriter of Old Dreams of Bianliang graduated from Minan University with a degree in history. May I ask what CEO\u2019s education is?\u3011\u3010Before you pretend to be hot s.h.i.+t can you take a good look at yourself? With this elementary schooler level of writing, you should learn how to speak first\u3011\u3010I really looked through all the problems he listed and checked on Baidu. How should I say this, the things he said, not many can be found on Baidu. The ones I could find weren\u2019t completely accurate either. CEO might be making history up in his dreams, or maybe he\u2019s been tricked by unofficial history records?\u3011\u3010CEO\u2019s famous quote: \u201cThis scriptwriter should learn from our programmer how to debug.\u201d This code monkey truly burst into laughter\u3011The fans\u2019 mockery wasn\u2019t completely unreasonable, because each of Shang Que\u2019s posts were comprised of two mistakes that the drama had made and one aggressive complaint. He didn\u2019t seem professional at all. More serious fans really took each Weibo post and double-checked their content, but discovered that much of the facts he had revealed couldn\u2019t be found on the Internet at all. Due to this, it was obvious that Shang Que was making stuff up. He was trying to step on the production team and celebrities.Suddenly, multiple fandoms reached an agreement and all entered the battlefield; they directly cussed Shang Que out so much that he ended up on the trending list. Shang Que\u2019s complaint Weibos got reposted tens of thousands of times, all done by fans demanding him to apologize.Qin Yuejian\u2019s fans held their heads up and puffed their chests out. They started raffles in the reposts, celebrating the fact that another 18th-list celebrity who wanted to get famous by stepping on their gege had become ruined before becoming popular once again.Inside Luofeng, everybody was miserable. Though most of their customers were extremely loyal and unbothered by these discussions, if this continued on, it would still seriously affect their ability to get new customers and their plans for further development.However, Yu Zhengdu was pretty calm. In comparison, he was more worried about Shang Que\u2019s mood. After all, Boss was someone who couldn\u2019t even bear to lose an argument in a game.Yu Zhengdu:\u3010Boss, don\u2019t take the comments online to heart. The netizens don\u2019t even know you. They\u2019re just making stuff up\u3011My broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010I\u2019m super angry!\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010That\u2019s not necessary. It\u2019s really not necessary\u3011My broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010I didn\u2019t even get to play with the water b.a.l.l.s. How dare they scold me\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010\u2026\u2026You\u2019re right. The netizens are too disobedient!\u3011My broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010Can you write me a program?\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010What program?\u3011My broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010One that will automatically argue for me\u3011My broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010I\u2019m using my fake account to argue with the netizens, but there are too many of them. I don\u2019t have enough time\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010\u2026\u2026\u3011It seemed like Boss\u2019s mental state was much better than he had originally thought. At the least, his unwillingness to admit defeat was still quite strong.Yu Zhengdu:\u3010I think you can succeed on your own. Jiayou, Xiaokui !\u3011But before Shang Xiaokui could do much, a new change arrived.First of all, Qin Yuejian suddenly stepped out and updated his Weibo to publicly express his support of Shang Que.Qin Yuejian: So it turns out CEO\u2019s account is From Today On I Will Be A European G.o.d ah . A few days ago I wanted to follow you but couldn\u2019t find your account. And thank you to all my fans for thinking of me, but CEO and senior Yu are both my friends. They\u2019re both very professional people, so definitely wouldn\u2019t make things up. As an actor, I\u2019m willing to hear everyone\u2019s opinions and suggestions. I hope no one will continue to make things difficult for CEO.After Qin Yuejian posted this, netizens went into an uproar. Who would\u2019ve thought that while his fans were tearing into Shang Que, he would come out and announce that he was friends with Shang Que. And he publicly expressed his support for Shang Que. This p.i.s.sed off many of Qin Yuejian\u2019s older fans so much that they unstanned him on the spot.Some netizens were just there to watch the drama unfold while others felt pity for the fans. More common, though, were people who thought that Qin Yuejian had gone crazy. Even if he wanted to create the image of someone humble and willing to learn, this wasn\u2019t the way to do it. He had completely disregarded his fans\u2019 feelings, which was a recipe for disaster.Qin Yuejian\u2019s announcement got onto the trending topics list within a few short hours. However, many drama fans and the fans of the other actors didn\u2019t agree with what he had said. They even started cussing at him too, requesting an apology from him.Amidst the chaos, the actor for the third male lead in Old Dreams of Bianliang, Fang Mo, also made a statement.Fang Mo: Pretending you understand when you don\u2019t is a taboo. And please, can some people refrain from supporting others so casually.Fang Mo and Qin Yuejian had debuted at around the same time. In terms of opportunities, they were always competing against each other. While filming this drama, their relations.h.i.+p had been complex too. Though his Weibo didn\u2019t straight out mention anyone\u2019s name, everyone could basically guess who he was talking about based on the time he had posted.If this were in the past, with Qin Yuejian\u2019s popularity, his fans would\u2019ve cussed Fang Mo to death for saying what he said. But now, it was the entirety of the drama\u2019s fans against everyone else; thus, n.o.body was angry with what he said. Instead, they felt that they finally had a leader with some influence. Instantly, the comments under his Weibo were all filled with support.But unluckily, the day Fang Mo posted, another account posted too.Professor Shen Wenrong of Diyang University: Recently, many friends have sent me the Weibo page of someone called From Today On I Will Be A European G.o.d, wanting me to a.n.a.lyze it. I took a close look at it and think that this netizen\u2019s posts about the Southern Song Dynasty are extremely professional. Many of the things he mentioned are things that we in academia are currently working on; these topics are still being debated so have not been released to the public yet. There are also some questions and difficulties that we have encountered that he has provided new lines of thought for. If possible, I hope that netizens can provide this From Today On I Will Be A European G.o.d\u2019s contact information. A few other professors and I would love to discuss these problems with him more in-depth.Diyang University was one of the most famous schools in the country for history majors. Several quite well-known historians had graduated from there. Professor Shen Wenrong was also one of the more respected history professors in Diyang University.After he posted this on Weibo, all the netizens lost their minds.The author has something to say:Shang Xiaokui, jiayou! I don\u2019t need to explain this joke right\u2026\u2026There is now an audio drama for this novel! Link here if you\u2019re interested ^^Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44 - Performance Increases SlightlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 44 - Performance Increases SlightlyNot only was Shen Wenrong an authority on history, he also loved spending time on the Internet. Consequently, he was somewhat of an Internet celebrity in the field of academia. Quite a few people followed him, which was also why so many netizens had sought him out to confirm whether or not what Shang Que had said was true.Because of this, as soon as he posted his Weibo, it instantly got reposted onto the front page of popular posts. Netizens\u2019 jaws all dropped. The comment section was filled with:\u3010???????????\u3011Some people shouted in disbelief from the depths of their souls:\u3010Professor, did your account get hacked?\u3011But Shen Wenrong very obviously valued Shang Que\u2019s Weibo greatly. He hadn\u2019t posted this out of the blue either, because soon after, he shared a very long post, listing all the criticisms Shang Que had made carefully and explaining them one by one.After this long post, netizens finally understood why Shen Wenrong was so respectful of Shang Que, even to the point of publicly announcing he wanted to discuss in further detail with him.The points that Shang Que had made on Weibo regarding the Southern Song\u2019s people, customs, outfits, rituals, behaviors, etc. contained no mistakes. At most, some areas were still under consideration by academics so were being debated and thus didn\u2019t have a final conclusion yet. But this didn\u2019t prove that Shang Que was wrong; instead, it proved that his understanding was so deep that it had already touched upon things normal people didn\u2019t understand, things that were still being examined.Others were things that even historians hadn\u2019t discovered yet, or things that had been hypothesized about with no further progress. Shang Que\u2019s Weibo also mentioned some small details that, according to Shen Wenrong, could possibly help them break through this barrier and make some important new developments.The aforementioned was also the reason that netizens couldn\u2019t find any information on Baidu even after going through Shang Que\u2019s criticisms one by one. The things he had brought up were too small and detailed that there would only be records of them in professional storage vaults, or only in the library at Diyang University. Even history majors, if they weren\u2019t specializing in Southern Song history, might not have been able to be so clear about such intricacies.After this long post, the scene of netizens angrily demanding Shang Que to apologize to the production team immediately changed. Drama fans and actor fans suddenly became silent, but netizens who weren\u2019t scared of causing trouble weren\u2019t willing to skip this opportunity to join in the fun.\u3010The one who mocked CEO for not being a professional historian before\u2026\u2026Now a professional historian has given him the stamp of approval. What does that friend have to say at this moment?\u3011\u3010I\u2019m dying of laughter. Someone even bragged about how the scriptwriter had graduated from Minan University with a degree in history. Now look, Minan University\u2019s reputation has been ruined\u3011\u3010Hehe, I\u2019ve been displeased about how much Old Dream fans were bragging about how serious their idol drama was. Overly bragging has caused issues now, see\u3011\u3010Isn\u2019t that so. Historical dramas having bugs aren\u2019t an issue. The fans are the ones who blew this up\u3011The most tragic person in this entire event was the third male lead, Fang Mo. Since debut, he had always been one step under Qin Yuejian. Even his role was less important in the drama. Thus, there was anger in his heart waiting to come out. Finally, he saw Qin Yuejian stupidly helping a non-celebrity speak up; Shang Que had p.i.s.sed off the entire cast of the drama. Besides, he had read all the netizens\u2019 a.n.a.lyses and concluded that 80% of Shang Que\u2019s Weibo was full of his own crazy ideas and bulls.h.i.+t. This was the reason he had so confidently taken this opportunity to step on Qin Yuejian.He never could\u2019ve imagined that the beautiful youth Shang Que, who had gotten popular because of a stupid video, had such a vast knowledge bank?Within a short period of time, his comment section got attacked by netizens wanting to get some gossip. They very mercilessly used his own words to mock him:\u3010Pretending you understand when you don\u2019t is a taboo\u3011On the other hand, Qin Yuejian, who had previously been cussed to the heavens by drama fans, received an abundance of praise after the situation turned around. Netizens all complimented him, saying he was both humble and loyal.But after this entire event, the person who received the most was Shang Que. He had originally gained a lot of fans, but they were all fans of his appearance. After this, netizens all sighed, so it turns out he doesn\u2019t only have a nice face. He\u2019s also a truly talented and educated person.\u3010Heaven really is too unfair. They gave CEO that face but also talent. Even worse, not only do I not have an issue with this, I seem to have fallen more in love with him\u2026\u2026\u3011\u3010This started because of his good looks, but I\u2019ve fallen because of his talents. I\u2019m declaring that CEO and I are locked !!\u3011Because of drama and actor fans\u2019 incessant efforts, almost everyone on Weibo knew that From Today On I Will Be A European G.o.d was Shang Que\u2019s account. Overnight, his follower count exceeded two hundred thousand, with signs of continued increase.Not only so, for right after this got on the trending list, a netizen suddenly posted a video taken on the day of the Palpitating Youth livestream. In the video, it was clear to see that when Qin Yuejian had his accident, the person who had thrown out that very crucial rope was Shang Que.Things had been a blur that day, and Shang Que had been standing near the back. Amidst the panic, the Big Eye Livestream cameras hadn\u2019t caught anything related to this. After the issue had gotten on the trending list, Big Eye only wished for it to go away sooner, so didn\u2019t make any additional explanations.But an unknown person had coincidentally filmed this scene. Now, even Qin Yuejian\u2019s fans who were still unimpressed had nothing left to say.After Qin Yuejian\u2019s announcement, most of his more extreme fans had unstanned. Those that remained were more reasonable. Since the turnaround in the history controversy, Shang Que had gained a large amount of new fans. These fans had a very good impression of Shang Que, so got together and made a hashtag for Shang Que as a way of apologizing.When Yu Zhengdu saw that hashtag on the trending list, he fell over laughing.Yu Zhengdu:\u3010Xiaokui, you\u2019re both beautiful and kind!\u3011My broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010I\u2019ve remembered all of their ID\u2019s. I\u2019m waiting for them to die to get my revenge\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010Calm down calm down\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010Hahahahahahahahahahaha\u3011My broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u3011At the same time, Kang Jin in the company\u2019s group chat:\u3010Boss got on the trending list again!!!\u3011Kang Jin:\u3010Boss, you\u2019re the pride of the Underworld!\u3011Shang Que:\u3010You, wage deduction\u3011Kang Jin:\u3010Why!!!!!!!!!!\u3011The hashtag that Qin Yuejian\u2019s fanclub had made for Shang Que was #CEO, both kind and beautiful#.Aside from the people paying their respects to Shang Que in the comments section, there was also a group of fans attracted by his looks screaming:\u3010Husband, mommy loves you!\u3011This made netizens who had clicked into the tag but didn\u2019t know what was going on suddenly think that they had accidentally walked into some large-scale ethics debate.\u2026\u2026The changes online caused all of Luofeng\u2019s employees to become bewildered. Everyone had originally been using their own accounts to help Boss argue with netizens, but who would\u2019ve thought that only mere days later, all the comments suddenly changed. This rendered all ten pages of cuss words on their Word doc.u.ments useless; they had nowhere to vent their anger anymore.Eventually, a coworker sent a screenshot of the comments section under Shang Que\u2019s Weibo to the group chat, terrified:\u3010So do these people actually want to be Boss\u2019s wife or his mom?\u3011The chat:\u3010\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Frightened.jpg\u3011Qu Guangzhao:\u3010Whether they want to be his mom or wife isn\u2019t important. What\u2019s important is that they\u2019ve all come to follow our official Weibo account\u3011Qu Guangzhao:\u3010[Screenshot]\u3011The screenshot Qu Guangzhao had sent was that of the follower count for \u201cAmazing Future\u201d, the Weibo account of their subsidiary company. Right now, it had already surpa.s.sed fifty thousand. Though this wasn\u2019t very impressive when compared to other Big V Weibo accounts, for a newly starting company with no attention from the general public, this was quite impressive. Not to mention that these were fresh and active fans, the kind with no zombies included.Without a doubt, these were fans that Shang Que had garnered.As Shang Que\u2019s reputation got better and better, some management companies and program producers got in contact to ask if Shang Que had any intention to enter the entertainment industry. However, Shang Que didn\u2019t even ask what benefits they were offering before directly rejecting them.Things had seemed alright when he had watched fandoms tear into each other on Weibo, but now that he had been dragged into a fight and been forced to experience it, Shang Que firmly believed that the entertainment industry was full of dangers.As a ghost who refused to admit defeat during online arguments, in the time before Yu Zhengdu agreed to develop an argument program for him, he would absolutely not have any inclination to enter the entertainment industry. He wasn\u2019t even willing to attend any public events again.Who knew that he originally only wanted to go step on some water b.a.l.l.s, but what ended up happening was that his Weibo account got exposed. Because of this, he had to go open another fake account. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t even be able to happily complain about his dramas anymore.A little event happened after all this. Professor Shen Wenrong called the company several times, hoping to invite Shang Que to attend their scholarly discussions. However, he got rejected by Shang Que every time with a very simple reason: I\u2019m too old. I don\u2019t remember that many things very clearly anymore.Shen Wenrong who received this reply thought of his own age: \u2026\u2026\u2026 Why did he feel like he somehow got mocked by Shang Que!But though Shang Que rejected him, Shen Wenrong would still continue to incessantly pester him with emails asking about certain topics related to the history of the Southern Song Dynasty. When Shang Que occasionally opened one and happened to remember something about the question, he would reply. This process would then repeat.For Luofeng, there was another accidental breakthrough. Not long after this trending topic incident, their company\u2019s jade stones received a few new orders. After investigating, they realized that these were all bought by Shang Que\u2019s fans. These girls had no idea what the jade was used for; or, to put it more accurately, didn\u2019t care. For them, the most important thing was that they were supporting their idol. This was very characteristic of fandom culture.Only, in the beginning, everyone thought that the sales brought in by fans would only be temporary. After all, though fans were pa.s.sionate, they were a very ruthless group. When it really came to climbing walls , they were faster than anybody else. But who would\u2019ve thought that these people would be one of the main reasons that their company\u2019s sales performance increased.***Gossip forum:t.i.tle: Poisonous , my dad who previously yelled at me for buying CEO\u2019s jade stone just bought Amazing Future\u2019s entire health checkup package for our entire family\u2026\u2026Main floor: Floor owner is a fan of CEO\u2019s face. Because I was trapped in CEO\u2019s devastating beauty, unable to escape, I secretly purchased a jade stone from Amazing Future. But, I accidentally let my dad see the price (everyone understands Amazing Future\u2019s prices). My dad scolded me for a long time and stopped giving me allowance for two months. I never expected that one day after returning home from school, a few extra people would be in my house. After asking, I found out that they were Amazing Future\u2019s employees. My dad suddenly! suddenly! bought Amazing Future\u2019s health checkup for the entire family without telling anyone. Those people were at my house to do the checkup\u2026\u2026Floor 1: ????????? Floor owner\u2019s story has caused me a great shock.Floor 2: Being able to afford CEO\u2019s jade with your allowance\u2026\u2026Floor owner\u2019s family is rich, appraisal complete.Floor 3: What did floor owner do to her dad?Floor 4: Wow, envious. Can floor owner share her experience? I want to own a jade from CEO too, but I really can\u2019t afford it. I urgently need a same-brand father\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Floor 233: Where\u2019s the floor owner? Running away after pretending to be hot s.h.i.+t. Hurry and come back to explain the situation clearly!Floor owner: I\u2019m back, I was just doing the checkup\u2026\u2026The situation is like this. A few days ago, I accidentally left the jade in my dad\u2019s car. Coincidentally, my dad\u2019s been in a bad state lately, kind of confused all the time. And then he saw the jade and picked it up\u2026\u2026I first need to clarify, all of the following was said by my dad, not me. Apparently, when he picked up the jade, he suddenly felt his confused mental state that had lasted several days disappear. More strangely, for some reason at the time, he had been driving a little crookedly. He almost drove straight into the lake. Because of the jade, he immediately became alert and hurriedly stepped on the brakes, barely managing to avoid death.Floor owner: In the beginning, my dad was still suspicious, not completely believing. He\u2019s old and sly, so went to recommend it to some of his collaborators. Who knew that his collaborators would suddenly purchase Amazing Future\u2019s entire service package and turn around to strongly recommend Amazing Future\u2019s health checkup to my dad. So\u2026\u2026Floor 236: After reading the main floor, I thought this was going to be a story of how a fangirl outwitted her dad in a battle of intelligence. I never expected it would take this turn\u2026\u2026Floor 237: To be fair, although I\u2019m a fan of CEO\u2019s face, the products of CEO\u2019s company still give me a slight sense that I\u2019m about to be scammed. After seeing floor owner\u2019s post, I kind of don\u2019t know what to say right now.Floor 238: Wait, floor owner\u2019s family really didn\u2019t get scammed?Floor 239: Upstairs\u2019 words don\u2019t make sense. According to floor owner, from buying the jade stone to purchasing the health checkup, their family took the initiative themselves. It\u2019s not like someone from CEO\u2019s company advertised it to them. This can\u2019t even be considered scamming?Floor 240: I didn\u2019t dare to post before, since I feared everyone would think that I had lost my mind because of a handsome appearance\u2026\u2026Actually, after buying CEO\u2019s jade, I also felt that my mind cleared and my luck got better. I thought it was just a placebo effect.\u2026\u2026Floor owner: Poisonous, my dad has already completely become Amazing Future\u2019s fan!!!! After finis.h.i.+ng the checkup just know, he thought that Amazing Future\u2019s results were super accurate. Right now he\u2019s calling all his other friends to recommend it to them!! To be honest, though I bought the jade stone at first, I still need to say. My dad\u2019s current state is no different from those old men who want to buy health products \u2026\u2026Floor 331: \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Speechless. I\u2019ll just wish floor owner a happy new year in advance.Floor 334: If not for the fact that floor owner has an old ID, I would start to suspect for her to be part of the Internet Navy for \u201cAmazing Future\u201d.Floor 335: Wow, I was originally hesitant about whether or not to buy it, because although I really like CEO\u2019s face, CEO\u2019s jade stones are really quite expensive. After seeing what you\u2019ve said in the tower, I\u2019ve gathered enough courage to place my order.Floor 336: Calm down upstairs. What\u2019s there to believe about this stuff?\u2026\u2026For a long time afterwards, similar posts and comments would appear periodically on forums and Weibo. Though many pa.s.sersby remained suspicious about this, several others were still influenced by them and went to get their own understanding of Amazing Future\u2019s products. Unintentionally, they brought in a lot of sales.Though Shang Que had developed an inextinguishable prejudice against the entertainment industry and trending topics list after this incident, for the development of their company, he still posted on Weibo from time to time. He mainly replied to netizens\u2019 questions about the Song Dynasty; because of his overly impressive professional ability, almost as soon as he went online, he would gain the opportunity to interact with Shen Wenrong and other respected academics. Thus, he attracted a lot of new fans too.But of course, posting pictures attracted the most fans.Materialistic netizens were very honest.***Time flew by quickly. By July, the Life and Death Accounts prototype system was finally released.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45 - Life and Death Accounts System ReleasedPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 45 - Life and Death Accounts System ReleasedLuofeng\u2019s Life and Death Accounts system was split into two parts: the backend system used by internal staff and the client server designed for public use.This time, it was the backend system used by internal staff being released.After the system was released, a training meeting was scheduled at the Luofeng headquarters. Yu Zhengdu was the instructor in charge of teaching Luofeng\u2019s employees how to use the new system\u2019s functions.\u201cOur backend system currently runs on six of the largest servers available, which effectively solves the problem where everything would crash on Excel when the numbers got too big.\u201d To display the severity and professionalism of the training session, Yu Zhengdu was wearing a collared s.h.i.+rt, which he rarely did. It made him look sharper and more well-kept than usual. Though he was young, every word he said, every pause he made, the way he smoothly spoke, all caused Luofeng\u2019s employees to understand how skilled he was in the matters of technology.\u201cThe energy that powers our servers is provided by our Great Ghost King and the faith of his mortal wors.h.i.+ppers. Let us express our sincerest respect for Boss.\u201d As Yu Zhengdu spoke, he started applauding Shang Que.Shang Que leaned against the back of his chair, legs crossed, elegant as usual. Upon hearing this, he slightly nodded. \u201cIn order to ensure that the server doesn\u2019t crash, I\u2019ve decided that from now on, I\u2019m going to eat all ghosts who have committed crimes so as to keep my energy levels up.\u201dEveryone panicked: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Great King, think again!\u201dYu Zhengdu said in exasperation, \u201c\u2026\u2026Don\u2019t make those kinds of jokes during meetings.\u201dEveryone: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026!!!!\u201d CTO dares to speak to Boss like that!Shang Que waved his hand. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll listen to you.\u201dEveryone: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026!!!\u201d Why is Boss listening to CTO????After this, Yu Zhengdu calmly continued, \u201cIn the future, we will continue to develop a Luofeng cloud server in order to resolve the issues of lagging caused by an overabundance of data when there is an increase in deaths during extremely cold winters or natural disasters.\u201d\u201cAt the same time, the structure of the cloud server can be used as the base for other Underworld Internet compositions. It\u2019ll be a crucial part in pus.h.i.+ng for the further development and modernization of the Underworld.\u201d\u201cBut cloud computing is a relatively new technology. We will need to partner with tech companies in the mortal realm.\u201d Yu Zhengdu glanced at his coworkers before his gaze finally fell on Shang Que. In his eyes, the antic.i.p.ation an employee had towards his boss were obvious. \u201cThis development fee will be even higher than previously, so everyone will need to work harder to earn money for the company.\u201dShang Que: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que\u2019s mouth twitched. He silently picked up his phone and took a selfie. \u201cI\u2019ll post on Weibo in a bit.\u201dThe other ghosts: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Boss has it so hard!\u201cNow I will proceed to introduce the system\u2019s functions and how to use them to everyone,\u201d Yu Zhengdu smiled. He switched to the next slide of the powerpoint. \u201cThis is the operation interface for the entire system. All you have to do is input the deceased\u2019s name and ID number into the search bar to be able to immediately look up their past and present lives within twenty reincarnations.\u201d\u201cTwenty reincarnations?\u201d Kang Jin was shocked. \u201cThen wouldn\u2019t we be able to find information on Qin s.h.i.+ Huang\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is only the furthest back that the system can support searches for right now,\u201d Yu Zhengdu explained. \u201cNot that we can find so many records for each spirit. In concept, this is because we considered that some spirits have relatively short lives; for example, though chickens have lifespans of seven to eight years, because of reasons we all know, most chickens don\u2019t live past one year before becoming food on the dining table. Thus, it\u2019s better for the reincarnation records to be more flexible and comprehensive.\u201dYu Zhengdu paused and added, \u201cTo protect spirits\u2019 privacies, we have already set query pa.s.swords for records beyond three reincarnations. You will need to use the Ghost King\u2019s magical seal to be able to see others.\u201dHis coworkers nodded from where they were sitting. In comparison to the system of the past, this function was definitely much more advanced. It could effectively maintain lengthy records of each spirit\u2019s past and present lives, but also protected one\u2019s privacy. This way, spirits couldn\u2019t manipulate, use, or expose others\u2019 reincarnation records.After explaining the Life and Death Accounts system\u2019s basic functions, Yu Zhengdu answered some related questions from those present before continuing.\u201cNow we will introduce a new function that the Life and Death Accounts didn\u2019t have before and that our product development team added after much consideration.\u201d Yu Zhengdu opened a new slide. \u201cReincarnation recommendation.\u201d\u201cAs everyone knows, the previous Life and Death Accounts utilized an outdated Underworld law and calculation algorithm, so oftentimes controversies would arise. For example, the good and evil amounts for reincarnating into a chicken or duck are about the same. So, should a spirit ultimately reincarnate into a chicken or a duck? This is a question that constantly plagues our coworkers and that can only be resolved after double-checking several of the deceased\u2019s deeds when alive.\u201dYu Zhengdu pointed in Zheng Yan\u2019s direction. \u201cThis difficulty has been settled by our excellent product manager, Zheng Yan. The function Zheng Yan designed can automatically identify the deceased\u2019s crucial accomplishments in life and can, in consideration of the current needs for ecological balance, give the most scientific recommendation.\u201dTheir ghostly coworkers immediately turned to Zheng Yan and gave him a fierce round of applause. Kang Jin said in admiration, \u201cZheng Yan, look at you. You\u2019re a living, breathing human, but how come you have so many ghostly ideas!\u201dZheng Yan: \u201ck2026;k2026;\u201d Though he had been working here for a while, he still wasn\u2019t used to how those of the Underworld spoke.Zheng Yan lightly coughed and said, \u201cWhat was it, didn\u2019t we have a really bad swine flu epidemic this year? So I thought if a lot of people reincarnated as pigs now, it would be a burden to both the mortal realm and Underworld. If they reincarnated to other animals with equivalent good and evil amounts, things would be much easier. Similarly, it\u2019s not recommended for large quant.i.ties of spirits to reincarnate into birds during an avian influenza. Thus, I thought that we could have the system pick up on data from the mortal realm to be able to give the most reasonable recommendation in consideration of the current ecological situation.\u201dSome of Luofeng\u2019s employees understood what he was saying, while others didn\u2019t. But their expressions were all filled with inexplicable admiration.Chen Yangli gave a thumbs up. \u201cI hadn\u2019t expected that us in the Underworld could contribute to the ecological balance of the mortal realm. I respect that.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Yu Zhengdu\u2019s expression was very cool. \u201cOnly balance between the Yin and the Yang can be considered real balance.\u201dZheng Yan sighed in relief too, then sent Wei Xiao a message:\u3010Boss Wei, thank you for your guidance. The new function I designed has been formally utilized by the company.\u3011Wei Xiao:\u3010No problem. I didn\u2019t expect for your company to also be concerned with the ecological balance. You guys truly feel responsible for society. Young man, work hard ah \u3011Zheng Yan:\u3010 Un un \u3011A drop of sweat rolled down his forehead. He didn\u2019t dare to go too in depth with Wei Xiao. He just thought: perhaps one day in the future, when Wei Xiao arrives in the Underworld hundreds of years later and sees this function, what would he think\u2026\u2026It could be said that the release of the backend system for the Life and Death Accounts greatly increased the workrate for all of Luofeng. It also successfully resolved certain management issues that had been plaguing the Underworld for a long time.The testing for this part of the system was being completed by Kang Jin and other current Luofeng employees.Another thing was, because the Life and Death Accounts were particularly important, crucial to the harmony and balance of the entire Underworld society, Luofeng made severe restrictions to who could login. Aside from those in the Life and Death Accounts department, other official employees, even those in the development department, weren\u2019t allowed to view the contents.All data related to the systems were secured with the Ghost King\u2019s magical seal. Without Shang Que\u2019s permission, no matter if you were a human programmer or Underworld spirit, you wouldn\u2019t be able to steal or change any of the server\u2019s information.\u2026\u2026After completing the Life and Death Accounts system training, Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que held a private mini meeting.\u201cIn accordance with the development schedule now, the app server should be able to be completed and released in September.\u201d Yu Zhengdu placed a copy of the project\u2019s Gantt chart in front of Shang Que.The backend system for internal employees had already been released. From now on, they would only need to continue altering and updating new versions of it.But as for the app server designed for use by all Underworld citizens, that was still under development.He emphasized, \u201cI mean, given that the circ.u.mstances are ideal.\u201dShang Que understood what he was hinting at. He asked, \u201cHave we run into difficulties?\u201d\u201cIn the development of mobile servers, we don\u2019t have any exceptional talents,\u201d Yu Zhengdu waved his hand.Computer system development and mobile server development used two different languages. Though Yu Zhengdu knew several languages, he still had those he was better with. He had been the main programmer for the development of the backend system and had also partic.i.p.ated in the development of the mobile server, but whether from a professional standpoint or in terms of his energy levels, he obviously wasn\u2019t able to take care of everything.Shang Que didn\u2019t know how to code, but he understood the general gist of it. Upon hearing this, he asked, \u201cSo should we hire someone else to be responsible for the mobile server?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll definitely have to hire one.\u201d Yu Zhengdu was very worried. \u201cBut to find a talent who can help lead us in the development of the mobile server will be extremely hard.\u201dShang Que: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe observed Yu Zhengdu\u2019s expression. Though the other didn\u2019t say anything, he could very clearly read two words in Yu Zhengdu\u2019s eyes: Small, poor.It also wasn\u2019t simply because they couldn\u2019t pay enough wages. The Life and Death Accounts application was directly connected to the order of the Underworld. The requirements for its development were far stricter than any app in the mortal realm. A person capable of being responsible for such a task would need to be both an extraordinary leader and an above average program developer.A person like that currently only existed in Nova and similar large companies. Their salaries started in the millions.Shang Que pondered a bit and said, \u201cHow about you choose a few project managers in those big companies. If there\u2019s one you think would fit, we can send someone to steal their soul.\u201dIf the other became a ghost, they would be completely under his control.\u201cCalm down!\u201d Yu Zhengdu pressed down with his hand. \u201cWe\u2019re an official company. I hope you can remember to follow the laws at all times.\u201dShang Que said reluctantly, \u201cSocialism has too many restraints on ghosts.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que thought about it and lamented, \u201cBut compared to demons and monsters we still have it a bit better. At least n.o.body has said that people can\u2019t be ghosts anymore after the reformation of the country.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026You\u2019re right.\u201dThe two discussed some more. In the end, they decided to outsource the job of mobile server development to freelancers.After talking about official business, Yu Zhengdu finally switched topics to personal business. He said, \u201cOh right. I need to take next Monday morning off. I\u2019ll be attending a technology summit.\u201dShang Que expressed his confusion, \u201cTechnology summit?\u201dYu Zhengdu nodded. The high-tech industry would sporadically hold some skill discussion meetings to explore the newest technologies, exchange information, etc. However, the hosts, guests, and quality of these meetings would all differ.The technology summit he spoke of was one of the most prestigious in all of Fu City. It was hosted by Nova, Double Horn Technology, and several other factories. Every year, the country\u2019s best tech employees and higher-ups would be in attendance. It was highly sought after by those in the industry.This year, because Nova was creating a new advanced laboratory and was currently searching for the best talents in the industry, the desire to attend this summit was unprecedentedly high. The main guest list had also been leaked quite a bit earlier.Jiao Shanlan from Nova\u2019s laboratory, Wei Xiao from Double Horn Technology \u2013 one of the leading figures in the field of artificial intelligence, and Riding Wind Technology\u2019s Cui Jianlan would all be in attendance. Aside from them, there was another name that everyone was both surprised and not surprised by: Zhao Ruola. She had previously been working at a large tech company in America, but had recently quit and returned to her home country.The shock factor of this guest list for the Internet field was the equivalent of a complete film emperor and empress lineup in the entertainment industry. Immediately, those in the field rose like a flock of startled birds. Those that were even slightly talented or had connections all tried their best to be allowed to attend. The requirements for getting an invitation were much stricter than in previous years.Yu Zhengdu could receive an invitation only because Jiao Shanlan had specially saved one for him.At first, Shang Que didn\u2019t think anything of it, but upon hearing that Yu Zhengdu\u2019s spot was given to him by Jiao Shanlan, he instantly sat up straight and slightly furrowed his brows. He said, \u201cLaboratory hasn\u2019t given up yet and still wants to steal you?\u201dYu Zhengdu could practically read the words in his gaze: Becoming a chicken warning.He hurriedly added, \u201clan is innocent, so don\u2019t write him down in your little booklet.\u201dShang Que laughed coldly. \u201cI\u2019ve already got him written down.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt appeared to be time to persuade Jiao Shanlan to do more charity work.Shang Que thought about it. \u201cHow about I go with you.\u201dYu Zhengdu expressed with difficulty, \u201c\u2026\u2026I only have one invitation.\u201dThe s.p.a.ce was extremely limited this year. Yu Zhengdu wasn\u2019t Nova\u2019s employee, so it was already amazing that Jiao Shanlan could give him one invitation. It was obviously impossible for him to bring anyone along.Shang Que added another line in his little booklet, expression dark. \u201cPurposefully separating us.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe made to exit the office, cold sweat on his forehead, only to run into Zheng Yan who was knocking to enter. He said, \u201cBoss, Leader , I need to take a day off tomorrow.\u201dShang Que was in a bad mood. Upon hearing this, he hrmph\u2019d and asked, \u201cFor what?\u201dZheng Yan replied, \u201cSomething came up at home. They told me to take a trip back.\u201dYu Zhengdu immediately became nervous. \u201cThey\u2019re not calling you back to inherit the family business, right?\u201dZheng Yan scratched his head. \u201cNo, my family has already given up on that wish. Some of my uncles from the collateral branches of our family are visiting to hold a family meeting.\u201dYu Zhengdu went oh . It wasn\u2019t polite to ask about others\u2019 private matters, so he only replied, \u201cAlright. Now that there\u2019s somewhat of a lull in your workload, I\u2019ll give you two days off. Along with the weekend, take some time to relax.\u201dOnly to see a stressed expression appear on Zheng Yan\u2019s face. \u201cEy, I most likely won\u2019t be able to relax.\u201dYu Zhengdu c.o.c.ked an eyebrow. \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201dZheng Yan sighed. \u201cMy dad said that the uncles in the collateral branches of our family found out that I don\u2019t have any talent in the ways of the Dao and don\u2019t plan on being a Daoist anymore, so specially arrived to try and split the magical tools pa.s.sed down from our ancestors.\u201dYu Zhengdu\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201cYou can do that?\u201dZheng Yan: \u201cYou can do that.\u201dThis was like when an old and aristocratic family didn\u2019t have any more heirs. All those even slightly related to them would suddenly appear to try and split the inheritance. This was simply a normal occurrence.Zheng Yan said in exasperation, \u201cThere isn\u2019t anything else to be done. I\u2019m truly not gifted in this regard.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean you\u2019re not gifted?\u201d Yu Zhengdu strongly disagreed. \u201cWhen all your uncles need to reincarnate later, they\u2019ll have to use the product and functions you designed.\u201dZheng Yan: \u201c\u2026\u2026 Yi .\u201dThat kind of made sense.The author has something to say:A hundred years later, Wei Xiao who finally arrives in the Underworld: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dTruly an Underworld business that feels quite responsible for society!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46 - Family of Heavenly MastersPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 46 - Family of Heavenly MastersZheng Yan\u2019s family was a somewhat locally well known family of heavenly masters in Ledu. They had a legacy of cultivation; counting Zheng Yan\u2019s father\u2019s generation, it had already been hundreds of years. Their ancestors had pa.s.sed down many spells and magical instruments, some that had truly been used to subdue demons and monsters. They were reinforced with the magic of the G.o.ds, and were famous even when considered in the entire Daoist community.There were several collateral branches of the Zheng family. Among them, some had switched to different paths to make a living, while others wholeheartedly spent their time on cultivation and were honestly talented. There were also a few that used the name of Ledu\u2019s Zheng clan to brag and scam others, earning money this way. But they didn\u2019t have that close of a relations.h.i.+p, so Zheng Yan\u2019s family couldn\u2019t control them.No matter what, though, Zheng Yan\u2019s family remained the official successors of the Zheng Heavenly Masters. Regardless of if the collateral branches truthfully practiced Daoism or faked practicing it, they still needed to use the Zheng clan\u2019s name to do business. Zheng Yan\u2019s family had always been the ones in charge.But unexpectedly, with Zheng Yan\u2019s generation, it appeared that the succession of power for the Zheng Heavenly Masters would be switching owners.The Zheng clan\u2019s successor was always heavily scrutinized by all other family members. Thus, everyone knew quite early on that Zheng Yan hadn\u2019t really made any advancements in the field of cultivation. Though his father Zheng Jing maintained that he was fated to be with ghosts and G.o.ds, only missing that moment of enlightenment, Zheng Yan had already graduated from university and was now working, but that moment still hadn\u2019t arrived yet.Before, the Zheng family had kept Zheng Yan at home for a year to learn cultivation, but Zheng Yan didn\u2019t made any progress during that time and had even packed up and run away from home after.Now, there were rumors that Zheng Yan had already completely fallen into the embrace of socialism and was now working at an Internet startup company.With this news, the collateral branches of the family who had previously had their eyes on the prize now started plotting.\u2026\u2026Zheng family mansion.\u201cCome, nephew of mine. Tell us, what are you doing now?\u201d The middle-aged man who spoke was named Zheng Shu. He was one of those collateral branches who didn\u2019t actually practice Daoism but only used the Zheng clan\u2019s name to scam others. Because he knew how to curry favor, though, he was doing pretty well now. People in the Zheng clan listened to what he had to say.Zheng Yan didn\u2019t have that great of an impression of him, but it wouldn\u2019t be polite to ignore his elders, so he cordially answered, \u201cI\u2019m working at an Internet company as their product manager.\u201dZheng Shu very exaggeratedly widened his eyes. \u201cNot bad ah , that\u2019s a field that pays a lot. Your future looks bright.\u201dZheng Yan\u2019s father Zheng Jing sat at the head of the table and impatiently interrupted, \u201cZheng Shu, say what you want to directly. You don\u2019t need to be wishy-washy.\u201dZheng Shu had no shame. Upon hearing this, he didn\u2019t feel embarra.s.sed at all and even replied, \u201cBig brother, since my nephew doesn\u2019t want to be a Daoist, the magical instruments of our Zheng clan can\u2019t stay with him, right? That would be a waste of good resources. In my opinion, it would be better to just take them out and split them between the brothers who are still interested in this path.\u201dSomeone off to the side b.u.t.ted in, \u201cBig brother, Zheng Shu is right. Zheng Yan won\u2019t be a Daoist, and we can\u2019t allow the reputation of the Zheng Heavenly Masters to fall into shambles. Why don\u2019t you give the instruments to others. The most important thing is to continue and help the Zheng clan become bigger and better.\u201dZheng Jing emotionessly said, \u201cJust because Zheng Yan won\u2019t inherit them doesn\u2019t mean that no one in my family will inherit them. When Zheng Yan gets married and has a child, I can have my grandson inherit them.\u201dUpon hearing this, Zheng Shu\u2019s expression changed into that of disagreement. \u201cNot that I\u2019m saying this to contradict you, big brother, but how long would we have to wait for your grandson to inherit them? The world changes so quickly now. In a few more years, there might not even be a place for us Zheng Heavenly Masters.\u201dEveryone immediately agreed.At this time, an invigorated middle-aged Daoist said, \u201cThe items belong to big brother\u2019s family. Big brother will naturally do with them as he sees fit. There\u2019s no need for us to force him to do anything.\u201dAs soon as he spoke, the originally rambunctious scene immediately quieted.Zheng Yan glanced up at him too. The one who spoke was called Zheng Guang. Out of everyone here today, he was fourth in line and belonged to the most impressive collateral branch of the Zheng clan.In Zheng Yan\u2019s generation, another extremely talented heir appeared in their family. Zheng Guang\u2019s son Zheng Dan had started learning Daoism since young. At age six, he opened his third eye; now, he was only a little over twenty but had already made quite a name for himself.Today Zheng Dan was in attendance too. He wore a Daoist robe and stood beside his father, back straight as a board, eyes alight with pa.s.sion, and with an impressive air. When compared to Zheng Yan, who wore a cla.s.sic programmer\u2019s collared plaid s.h.i.+rt and who appeared slightly out of it because of all the overtime he had done at work, they seemed like polar opposites.Zheng Yan\u2019s mood was quite conflicted upon seeing Zheng Dan. They were around the same age, but Zheng Yan was the official heir of the Zheng clan while Zheng Dan was the established prodigy of the clan. Since young, they had often been compared by their elders.Unfortunately, the result of such comparisons revealed Zheng Yan to be the accompanying green leaves , the one used to prove how much of a prodigy Zheng Dan was.Actually, in terms of intelligence, Zheng Yan wasn\u2019t worse off than Zheng Dan. In the nine years of mandatory education they had taken, they had attended the same school. Zheng Yan\u2019s grades were much better than Zheng Dan\u2019s. After graduating from middle school, Zheng Dan dropped out of school to focus on cultivation while Zheng Yan continued on until he got into a good college.It was a pity that to the Zheng Heavenly Masters, no matter how impressive your education was, it didn\u2019t matter if you didn\u2019t practice the ways of the Dao.After Zheng Yan attended university and still refused to become a Daoist, in recent years, the collateral branches of the Zheng clan seemed to be subtly starting to kiss up to Zheng Guang\u2019s branch.Like when they just arrived. Quite a few of his other uncles had gone up to connect with Zheng Dan, praising him incessantly. As the official heir, Zheng Yan didn\u2019t receive much attention.This wasn\u2019t hard to understand. If Zheng Yan\u2019s family lost the official inheritance, even just for one generation, they would definitely suffer a great blow. And now, Zheng Dan was at his prime. It was very likely that he would become the head of the newer generation. If Zheng Guang rose to prominence, it wasn\u2019t impossible that they would replace Zheng Yan\u2019s family as the official main family of the Zheng clan.Zheng Yan wasn\u2019t an idiot. He knew that Zheng Guang was only saying this for appearances, but in reality was trying to make concessions in order to gain advantages. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have appeared here today in the first place.As expected, before Zheng Guang could finish speaking, Zheng Shu added on after a few exclamations, \u201cNumber four, you may not mind, but today I must express how unfair things are for you. Actually, I\u2019m not interested in the magical instruments of the Zheng clan at all. This is just because I feel pitiful about Zheng Dan\u2019s condition right now.\u201d\u201cWho here doesn\u2019t know that cultivation requires talent. Zheng Dan is this\u2014\u2014\u201d Zheng Shu held up a thumb for everyone to see as he spoke. \u201cOpening his third eye at age six. Forget all us collateral branches. Even big brother\u2019s family hasn\u2019t had such a prodigy in the fast few generations. Since the Zheng Heavenly Masters cannot break tradition, shouldn\u2019t the most fitting successor for the new generation be Zheng Dan?\u201dAs soon as Zheng Shu said this, everyone else present immediately agreed.\u201cIsn\u2019t that so. These past few years, Zheng Dan has done a lot of good work out in the world. The fame of our Zheng clan has risen quite obviously.\u201d\u201cYou guys haven\u2019t heard. Just in this past year, so many people have already asked me to help contact Zheng Dan. They want him to go cast spells for them.\u201d\u201cMe too. They all named him specifically; they only want Zheng Dan. I bet that soon after, when outsiders mention the Zheng clan, they\u2019ll be speaking of Zheng Dan.\u201dThey all added on to each other, their words subtly roasting Zheng Yan\u2019s family. It was a good thing that he and his father were already prepared. They managed to hold in their anger despite hearing this conversation.Instead, Zheng Dan stepped out and told the others to stop. \u201cUncles, please don\u2019t say that. These are all exaggerations is all.\u201d\u201cEy ey ey, nephew you\u2019re being too humble,\u201d Zheng Shu exaggeratedly gestured. \u201cI heard that just last month, you subdued a mandrill on Maiqiu Mountain near the capital?\u201dAs soon as Zheng Shu spoke, everyone\u2019s expressions became surprised, regardless of if they had known about this before or not.\u201cTruly? He subdued a mandrill?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll need to be more clear. Did he destroy it or subdue it to serve him?\u201dZheng Dan very smoothly replied, \u201cIt was a mandrill. It was a menace to several of the villages nearby and the villagers couldn\u2019t take it anymore, so called me to take care of it.\u201dHe paused. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy for the mandrill to achieve such skills, so I didn\u2019t kill it. I simply subdued it to become under my control.\u201dZheng Shu lamented, \u201cNephew of mine is oversimplifying it. I have friends over there and they all tell me that that wasn\u2019t a normal mandrill. That mandrill has hidden in Maiqiu Mountain, cultivating, for who knows how many years. It achieved a great level of cultivation, so many of the religious masters they had found previously couldn\u2019t do anything about it. But as soon as Zheng Dan arrived, not only did he defeat it, but he also made the mandrill obediently listen to him as his servant. This is skill, wouldn\u2019t you all agree?\u201dAs soon as Zheng Shu finished speaking, everyone responded with shock. In an instant, the praise and applause wouldn\u2019t stop.Even Zheng Jing couldn\u2019t help but view him in a different light. He asked, \u201cZheng Dan, you really subdued a mandrill?\u201dZheng Dan nodded. \u201cYes.\u201dZheng Jing sighed, \u201cYou are truly talented.\u201dActually, if this were in the past, it wouldn\u2019t have been impressive at all for a Zheng Heavenly Master to subdue a mandrill. But ever since fifty years ago, for some reason, the energy between the Heavens and earth had sharply decreased. There was no magic in the mortal realm, so several Daoists\u2019 abilities were much weaker than before.In their generation, they had already become unable to sense the G.o.ds completely. Though they could still borrow the remaining energy to cast spells, the power produced was much less in comparison.To subdue a mandrill today would require a lot of energy, not to mention that Zheng Dan was only just past the age of twenty.Zheng Jing said, \u201cIf that is so, then I will gift you a magical instrument of the Zheng clan. Take it with you and practice diligently. Your future will undoubtedly be boundless.\u201dHe asked, \u201cIs there any tool you are best with right now?\u201dOnly to hear Zheng Guang say, \u201cBig brother, the tool Zheng Dan uses best right now is an eight trigrams mirror.\u201dZheng Jing\u2019s expression changed. He lowly said, \u201cThe Zheng clan only has one qiankun eight trigrams mirror, and that\u2019s going to be pa.s.sed on to my grandson. Zheng Dan, choose something else.\u201dBefore Zheng Dan could speak, Zheng Shu jumped out to say, \u201cBig brother, since you already agreed to give him an instrument, which specific one doesn\u2019t matter. Since Zheng Dan is used to using an eight trigrams mirror, then when he starts using the qiankun eight trigrams mirror, he will definitely be able to use it to its full potential. Wouldn\u2019t that be the best outcome?\u201dZheng Yan who had stood to the side listening to them argue finally understood what was going on. After all this effort, it seemed that these people were here for the qiankun eight trigrams mirror.No wonder they had caused such a big commotion and so many people had come.The Zheng clan owned several magical instruments, but the most famous among them was undoubtedly that qiankun eight trigrams mirror, pa.s.sed down from the first Zheng Heavenly Master. This trigrams mirror had truly been reinforced by the Three Pure Ones . It had subdued an abundance of demons, monsters, and ghosts, so was well-known in the Daoist community.The Zheng Heavenly Masters had always portrayed this eight trigrams mirror as a source of pride. If it got pa.s.sed down to Zheng Dan, wouldn\u2019t that mean they were giving the official t.i.tle of head of family to Zheng Guang\u2019s branch?Zheng Jing naturally wouldn\u2019t agree, but Zheng Guang had obviously come prepared. He didn\u2019t say much, but everyone else kept speaking, until Zheng Jing couldn\u2019t even get a word in.Though Zheng Yan didn\u2019t practice Daoism, he had been surrounded by it since young. Thus, he knew how important this eight trigrams mirror was. Now that he was witnessing these people working together to bully his father, he immediately became furious. He stood up and said, \u201cUncles, you guys are being too much. The eight trigrams mirror belongs to our family. Whether or not we want to give it away is up to my father.\u201dZheng Shu completely disregarded him. He scoffed in response and mocked, \u201cZheng Yan, you don\u2019t even practice Daoism. Why are you b.u.t.ting into us Daoists\u2019 business?\u201dSomeone else added on, \u201cAren\u2019t you working on your new high tech things now? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re thinking of still hogging the eight trigrams mirror?\u201dIt had been fine before Zheng Yan had spoken, but now that he had, he immediately became the target of their criticisms. Everyone suddenly remembered him, so started using him as their topic of conversation. Their words were all quite vindictful, as if Zheng Yan\u2019s refusal to give up the eight trigrams mirror was the equivalent of him hogging the toilet but not needing to s.h.i.+t. He would be the downfall of all the Zheng Heavenly Masters because of his selfishness.Upon seeing their att.i.tude, Zheng Jing\u2019s heart dropped. He thought to himself oh no. In the beginning, he could still remain tight-lipped and refuse to agree, but now that Zheng Yan had spoken up, if he continued to be stubborn, these people would definitely blame Zheng Yan for anything bad that happened to the Zheng clan in the future. They were determined to paint Zheng Yan as the Zheng clan\u2019s greatest sinner of the past thousand years.Zheng Jing thought quickly and hurriedly shouted, \u201cZheng Yan, stop talking.\u201dZheng Yan reluctantly stopped, but everybody else refused to back down so easily. They still wanted to argue, only to see Zheng Guang gesture with his hand, indicating for everyone to quiet down. Then, he finally looked at Zheng Jing. \u201cBig brother, don\u2019t be mistaken. Our intentions really aren\u2019t to steal the qiankun eight trigrams mirror from you under these circ.u.mstances. It\u2019s just that Zheng Dan truly is a prodigy, so we hope that he can become even better. This is all for the Zheng clan\u2019s development too.\u201dHe turned around to glance at Zheng Dan. \u201cDan\u2019er, let your mandrill out so your uncle can see.\u201dZheng Dan reached into his bag and pulled out a tiny calabash gourd. He removed the stopper at the mouth of the gourd and said, \u201cOkay.\u201dAt the same time, Zheng Jing shouted, \u201cWait, don\u2019t let it out.\u201dBut he was still too late. Zheng Dan\u2019s calabash gourd was already open. From the mouth of the gourd, a ball of dark, black smoke emerged. Soon after, a strange \u201chuhu\u201d noise sounded out, followed by the appearance of a creature around the size of a three year old child with a bulging forehead and prognathic mouth.Though the mandrill was also called a mountain ghost, it wasn\u2019t actually a ghost, but a spirit-creature of the mountains. One could see it even without a third eye.And the reason Zheng Jing had shouted was, he had suddenly remembered that his son Zheng Yan not only refused to become a Daoist, but also\u2026\u2026was deathly terrified of ghosts and such creatures.Only to see that the mandrill Zheng Dan had subdued was quite grotesquely shaped. Its arms were thin and long, and its lower body was comprised of a single, thick leg. The foot faced backwards and a row of sharp canines emerged from its mouth. Both eyes were blood red.Zheng Jing only needed to take one glance to figure out that this mandrill was quite abnormal, but he didn\u2019t have time to dwell on this matter. He hurriedly looked over at Zheng Yan, frightened that his son would pa.s.s out from terror in front of everyone.He turned around to see that Zheng Yan\u2019s expression was shocked, as expected. But upon further inspection, he realized that he didn\u2019t seem extremely scared. Instead, he seemed a little\u2026\u2026disdainful\uff1fZheng Jing: ?????He couldn\u2019t help but call out, \u201cZheng Yan?\u201dZheng Yan turned around. \u201cSomething wrong?\u201dZheng Jing paused for a bit. He sighed, \u201cNothing.\u201dZheng Yan was bewildered. He turned back to observe the mandrill. Thanks to his practice with his coworkers normally, this mandrill could only be considered as having a rather normal appearance in his eyes now.As soon as the mandrill appeared, it threw its head back and howled, causing the hearts of everyone present to tremble. After, it waved its thin, long, and sharp claws around. With a screech, it tried to pounce into the area with the most people.Everyone\u2019s expressions immediately changed. Zheng Dan instantly pulled out an eight trigrams mirror and made hand gestures with his other hand. He pointed the mirror at the mandrill and yelled, \u201cHow brave, you beast. You dare to be so reckless?\u201dAs soon as the eight trigrams mirror landed on the mandrill, it immediately lost half of its imposing aura. It retracted its sharp claws and reluctantly returned to stand in front of Zheng Dan.Zheng Dan apologetically told everyone, \u201cI\u2019ve disturbed you, uncles. This mandrill\u2019s cultivation level is extremely high, and it also had a proud temperament. I still need to train it for a while before I can completely tame it.\u201dZheng Shu patted his chest and responded with lingering fright, \u201cUnderstandable, understandable. This mandrill isn\u2019t your average mandrill. It has one leg, a backwards foot, and red eyes.\u201dFolklore legends regarding the mandrill were plentiful, but most were only describing regular monsters or extra ferocious animals. But the one Zheng Dan had subdued was a proven and true mandrill. Only real mandrills had one leg and a backwards foot. The red eyes were an indication of how high its cultivation was.Zheng Dan modestly said, \u201cI had to use a lot of energy to subdue it.\u201dZheng Shu tsk\u2019d and shook his head. \u201cYou can already subdue it now. When you get the qiankun eight trigrams mirror, wouldn\u2019t it be a piece of cake to completely tame this mandrill?\u201dWith this, he directly implied that Zheng Dan would definitely be able to receive the qiankun eight trigrams mirror.Everyone else added on, telling Zheng Jing, \u201cBig brother, Zheng Dan has managed to reach such high cultivation at such a young age. It won\u2019t be a waste giving him the eight trigrams mirror.\u201dZheng Jing\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t so great. Zheng Guang looked over and smiled slightly. \u201cBig brother, I\u2019m not trying to make things difficult for you on purpose. It\u2019s just that recently, Zheng Dan has reached a block in his cultivation that\u2019s hard to break through. If you\u2019re willing to give him the eight trigrams mirror, I would be infinitely grateful\u2026\u2026How about this. Just think that you are lending him the mirror. After Zheng Yan gets married and has his own child and your grandson inherits the official t.i.tle of Zheng Heavenly Master, we can return the eight trigrams mirror to you?\u201dZheng Guang announced his plan clearly. It sounded reasonable, but if one thought about it carefully, one would realize it was full of traps. As soon as the eight trigrams mirror got \u201clent\u201d out, and Zheng Dan used it to become famous, it would be extremely difficult to get him to return it.But Zheng Jing was already at a dead end. He could refuse, but if he did, Zheng Yan would be destined to bear the brunt of everyone\u2019s accusations. If he took a step back and thought about it, even if Zheng Yan had a kid, it would still be hard for the child to surpa.s.s Zheng Dan\u2019s talent. By then, the official branch would collapse and those magical instruments would still fall into the hands of the greedy collateral branches anyways.But now, if he could use the eight trigrams mirror to better relations with Zheng Guang\u2019s branch and ask them to protect Zheng Yan in the future, maybe there was hope.Zheng Jing sighed in regret in his heart. He was truly reluctant.Zheng Dan conveniently added, \u201cThis is mainly because Yan ge doesn\u2019t practice Daoism. Otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t dare to make this request.\u201dThis made Zheng Jing finally make up his mind. He was just about to bite the bullet and speak, only to hear Zheng Yan beat him to the punch and say, \u201cWho said I\u2019m not practicing Daoism.\u201dZheng Jing didn\u2019t manage to make a noise. The words he was about to say got stuck in his throat as he stared at Zheng Yan.Only to see his face was red with fury and his cheeks puffed out. It was obvious how p.i.s.sed he was. Zheng Jing understood his feelings, so comforted, \u201cZheng Yan, I\u2019ll deal with it\u2026\u2026\u201dBut Zheng Shu refused to let this opportunity escape. He roared with laughter. \u201cZheng Yan, didn\u2019t you say you\u2019re working with the Internet? How are you practicing Daoism? Practicing Daoism online?\u201dZheng Yan decided to go all in. He used the mannerisms and techniques Yu Zhengdu often did when discussing business with clients; he puffed out his chest and said, \u201cYes. Traditional Daoism is too slow, so I\u2019ve decided to enter into a high tech industry: scientific cultivation.\u201dEveryone: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dZheng Jing: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Son, hurry and shut up!Zheng Shu couldn\u2019t stop laughing. He didn\u2019t even care about his usual pretense of being a Daoist as he rocked with laughter.\u201cHow rare that Zheng Yan is willing to practice cultivation. You should stop laughing at him,\u201d Zheng Guang conveniently stopped Zheng Shu.Zheng Shu innocently said, \u201cWait no, number four, you\u2019re being serious?\u201dZheng Guang turned to Zheng Yan. \u201cZheng Yan, since you say you\u2019re practicing Daoism too, how about you perform something for us.\u201dAs soon as he spoke, everyone at the scene looked like they were getting ready to watch a good drama.Zheng Jing sighed. As expected, Zheng Guang was too sly and cunning. It looked like he was helping Zheng Yan, but in actuality, he was setting traps for him.Naturally, Zheng Yan looked bewildered. He had only made that up, he didn\u2019t really know anything. Thus, he could only dumbly ask, \u201cHow?\u201dZheng Guang was determined to win today. He had long since figured out what was going on with Zheng Yan. Upon seeing his reaction, he was even more confident, so said, \u201cAs you saw, your cousin subdued a mandrill. You haven\u2019t been practicing for that long, so we won\u2019t be that strict. If you can subdue a little ghost, or control one, that will suffice.\u201dHe slightly smiled, \u201cIf you can do any of the aforementioned to prove that you really have successfully started cultivation, we naturally won\u2019t dare to bring up the eight trigrams mirror again.\u201dZheng Jing: Ey.His son was scared of ghosts himself. How could he subdue ghosts?Only to hear Zheng Yan happily respond, \u201cSummoning ghosts ah , I know how to do that.\u201dIt was a good thing that the story of how Yu Zhengdu had emerged victorious in a nasty battle with the demon priest Jin Heguan was well known throughout their company. This allowed Zheng Yan to immediately remember that though he didn\u2019t know how to cast spells, he had their company\u2019s WeChat group chat.As soon as he said this, everyone present went: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dA bewildered expression appeared on Zheng Guang\u2019s face momentarily, but he very quickly regained his composure. He maintained his fake smile and said, \u201cThen show us right now.\u201d\u201cAlright,\u201d Zheng Yan said as he pulled out his phone. He started composing a message to send in the company group chat.Zheng Guang was completely confused. He asked, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dZheng Yan sent the message and, imitating Yu Zhengdu\u2019s aura, put his hands on his hips and confidently exclaimed, \u201cWe practice Daoism through scientific ways. I\u2019m summoning ghosts with a high tech method!\u201dZheng Guang: ????Everyone: ?????Zheng Shu roared with laughter. \u201cAiyo, nephew of mine, it seems to me that not only have you failed in cultivation, you\u2019ve also gone crazy because of that stupid Internet job?\u201dThough no one else expressed their opinions openly, from their gazes, it was easy to tell that they were thinking the same thing.Zheng Jing couldn\u2019t help but facepalm: Ey\u2014\u2014He sighed to himself, but suddenly felt a chill go down his back. He couldn\u2019t help but feel confused as he removed his hand from his face. It was only then that he realized the room had abruptly gone dark. Immediately after, a large bolt of heavenly lightning struck the ground outside the room. The wind howled furiously, blowing against each person\u2019s face and causing pain.Though they were a family of heavenly masters, they still had never witnessed such a fierce scene before.Zheng Yan was also shocked by this imposing show of power. He hurriedly looked down at his WeChat.Kang Jin:\u3010What kind of people are those uncles of yours? Wait for me!\u3011Chen Yangli:\u3010Oh no, your house is too far away. It\u2019ll take half a day to drive there. Can you cast a spell to summon us?\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010He doesn\u2019t know how to cast spells, right?\u3011Shang Que:\u3010I\u2019ll go.\u3011Groupchat:\u3010\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u3011Kang Jin:\u3010Boss, have mercy!!!!!\u3011Lu Lingxi:\u3010These people\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Are in need of a round of pummeling from the Ghost King\u3011Zheng Yan was shocked. He hurriedly typed:\u3010Boss, that\u2019s not necessary. It\u2019s really not necessary.\u3011Immediately after, he received a private message from Kang Jin:\u3010Sh\u2014\u2014\u3011Kang Jin:\u3010For some reason, Boss has been in a really bad mood these past few days\u3011Kang Jin:\u3010I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going for you. I think he simply wants to beat someone up.\u3011Zheng Yan:\u3010\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u3011The author has something to say:So, why is the Ghost King in a bad mood?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47 - Scientific CultivationPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 47 - Scientific CultivationThe Zheng family mansion was completely dark, filled with gusts of cold wind that caused the residents to become unsteady on their feet. Fear rose in their hearts.The mandrill that Zheng Dan had subdued seemed to perceive a threat. It kept growling nonstop. Mandrills were ferocious but not that intelligent; they relied on brute force to defend themselves. It scurried around the room, jumping back and forth and baring its teeth in the direction of the door. Its eyes were so red they looked like they were glowing.All the Heavenly Masters in the room were beyond shocked. Zheng Dan abruptly turned around and pointed the eight trigrams mirror in his hand at the door. He yelled, \u201cUncles, please be careful. Something evil is intruding.\u201dEveryone else instantly regained their wits. He was right. This show of power had only ever been recorded in their ancestor\u2019s notes. Even those Heavenly Masters who had been directly taught by their elders hadn\u2019t seen anything like this before. Forget witnessing such an event, in the past few decades, stories of such power hadn\u2019t even been spread among the citizens.This was definitely a demon that would be hard to deal with. Even if all of them worked together, they might not be able to emerge victorious.As soon as they reached this conclusion, the Daoists present all felt fear grip their hearts. Regardless of if they were truly skilled or only scammers, they all took out the magical equipment they kept on their persons and prepared to start their incantations.Suddenly, they heard Zheng Yan say, \u201cEveryone, there\u2019s no need to be so nervous. This is the guest I\u2019ve invited over\u2026\u2026 ke , I mean ghost, ghostly guest.\u201dEveryone present: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThey almost simultaneously turned around to stare at Zheng Yan.Zheng Shu was in disbelief. \u201cYou invited it? That\u2019s impossible. You can invite such a\u2026\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish speaking, a low voice rang out from the thick dark void. \u201cZheng Yan, I\u2019m here.\u201dZheng Shu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWith a clink, the copper coin sword in Zheng Jing\u2019s hand fell onto the ground. His jaw dropped as he stared at his son. A pause later, he asked in incredulity, \u201cZheng Yan, you really invited it?\u201dZheng Yan truly hadn\u2019t expected Shang Que to personally come and make the situation larger than life. But it had already happened, so the only thing he could do now was bite the bullet and play along. Thus, he imitated what his family members normally did and put his hands together to bow. He greeted, \u201cGreat King, welcome.\u201dEveryone: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dFather and son, Zheng Guang and Zheng Dan, stared at the thick black fog outside the door in shock. The voice emanating from the void was low, but reached into one\u2019s heart. Even they, who believed that their cultivation levels were in the top tier of the field, couldn\u2019t help but feel panicked and somewhat powerless.This definitely wasn\u2019t a normal ghost. It was likely a ghost king that had cultivated for who knows how many years\u2026\u2026It was ultimately the official Heavenly Masters\u2019 descendant that had enough willpower to make a stand at this crucial moment. Zheng Jing grabbed his son. \u201cZheng Yan, who is this that you\u2019ve invited?\u201dZheng Yan didn\u2019t dare to directly share the name of Luofeng Mountain\u2019s Ghost King. He was in the middle of thinking of a believable excuse when he heard Shang Que coldly hum. \u201cThis is a room full of Daoists, but no one can recognize me?\u201dThe room full of Daoists: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHow could we recognize you? They had been Daoists since birth, but had never witnessed such an imposing scene.Shang Que sounded extremely cross. \u201cThis king is angry. Right now I\u2019m going to catch a few people to beat up.\u201dEveryone present: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dWait, this King is a little unreasonable?!Zheng Yan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d f.u.c.k, Boss is only looking for an excuse to beat someone up, right!Zheng Yan hurriedly rushed forward and tried to send a message through his eyes. \u201cGreat King, the ones standing around are my uncles. They\u2019re all quite old, so if they get hurt, who knows how long it\u2019ll take them to recover. Please have mercy, have mercy!\u201dShang Que scoffed. \u201cLooking at these people, I can see that not only are they quite old, they also have a lot of cunning plots.\u201dEveryone present: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d This was their first time meeting this ghost king, but why were his words so impolite?Everyone felt anger rising in their chests. If this were normally, they would\u2019ve started arguing a long time ago, but in the face of absolute power, they could only pitifully swallow this anger with dark expressions.Zheng Yan comforted, \u201cIt can\u2019t be helped, it happens with age. Hopefully Great King can forgive this.\u201dEveryone present: \u2026\u2026 Was Zheng Yan taking this opportunity to mock them?!Shang Que hrmph\u2019d coldly again. \u201cBecause of you, I won\u2019t beat up these rude old men for now.\u201dThe cold wind billowed; the thick black smoke dissipated and reconjoined. Just when everyone was about to breath out a sigh of relief, the void suddenly spoke once more. \u201cIsn\u2019t that a young one? Since I can\u2019t beat up the old ones, I\u2019ll beat up the young one.\u201dThe black fog spread out. The thick smoke took the form of an enormous arm and slowly pointed at Zheng Dan.Shang Que: \u201cYou\u2019re it.\u201dZheng Dan was immediately bewildered. He instinctively held up the eight trigrams mirror in his hand and chanted while making hand gestures, \u201cDemon king be controlled, serve me Xuan\u2026\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish, a faint cracking noise sounded out. Sudden pain bloomed in his hand. He looked down to see that his eight trigrams mirror had already broken into an infinite number of pieces and fallen to the ground. His fingers that had originally been gripping the mirror were covered in small cuts.Zheng Dan was terrified. His expression instantly became bewildered.Ever since birth, he had been hailed as a prodigy. He had learned the ways of the Dao since young, opened his third eye at age six, and recently subdued a red-eyed mandrill. His accomplishments were impressive even when compared to all of the Daoists in Huaxia. He had always been proud of these, but now, he realized for the first time that in the face of a true demon king, his skills were worth nothing.Forget putting up a fight. He didn\u2019t even have enough time to finish his incantation.Zheng Dan looked at his broken instrument and turned his dazed gaze forward. He waited for the Ghost King to attack him, only to see the mandrill he had subdued suddenly charge forward and stand in front of him. It bared its teeth and waved its claws at the black smoke.At the same time, his father Zheng Guang urgently shouted, \u201cHurry, mandrill. Protect Dan\u2019er!\u201dZheng Dan immediately became alert once more. That\u2019s right, he hadn\u2019t completely lost yet. He still had a mandrill he could control.He inhaled deeply and started making gestures with his hands once more, planning to order the mandrill into action.Only to see the black smoke change form once again. A huge fist appeared in the air and landed on the mandrill\u2019s head. The Ghost King\u2019s tone of voice was extremely displeased. \u201cWhere did this mandrill come from, it\u2019s so ugly!\u201dWith a 'splat\u201d, the originally ferocious mandrill landed on the ground, limbs every which way.\u201cHu hu\u2014\u2014hu hu\u2014\u2014\u201d The mandrill finally realized what was going on after falling on the ground. On the spot, it changed into a kneeling position and started kowtowing to the black fog incessantly. It was practically completely glued to the floor.Zheng Dan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dZheng Guang: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dEveryone present: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThe scene instantly fell into an awkward silence.Shang Que very disdainfully said, \u201cYour level is too low. Don\u2019t wors.h.i.+p me.\u201dThe mandrill pitifully changed its posture from kneeling in wors.h.i.+p to huddling in a sorrowful ball.The fist made of black smoke slowly s.h.i.+fted closer to Zheng Dan. Shang Que scoffed coldly, \u201cToday I am adamant about hitting someone.\u201dAt this crucial moment, Zheng Yan bravely stepped out and charged forward. He held up his phone and said, \u201cGreat King, have mercy.\u201dOnly to see that his phone was connected to a video chat. Through the lens, Yu Zhengdu shouted in surprise, \u201cWow, this Ghost King is both black and big!\u201dShang Que: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu clapped his hands together and said with a smile, \u201cXiao Shang, I ordered afternoon tea. Hurry and come back to eat with me.\u201dThe billowing cold wind instantly stopped and slightly dissipated. Though they couldn\u2019t see the Ghost King in the darkness, everyone could very clearly feel that this Great King had suddenly reigned in his own temper.The enormous black-smoke-fist reconjoined then dissipated, until ultimately, it moved away from Zheng Dan\u2019s head. But when it pa.s.sed by the mandrill, it still was angry so punched the mandrill\u2019s head a few more times, until the mandril couldn\u2019t stop howling in pain. It didn\u2019t dare to escape, though, so could only cradle its head and take the beating with tears in its eyes.It really seemed like whack-a-mole.Shang Que got rid of his anger and finally drawled out an \u201c un \u201d to the person on the other side of the screen. Even his voice was much gentler than before.Zheng Yan exhaled a long sigh. In this company, CTO\u2019s words were truly the most effective.He turned off the video chat and sent Yu Zhengdu a sticker expressing his thanks.Though Shang Que was a bit disappointed, he still hrmph\u2019d and said, \u201cThis king is leaving now.\u201dZheng Yan hurriedly bid farewell. \u201cGreat King take your time. Have a safe journey.\u201dThe thick fog lazily retreated and slowly dissipated.At this time, the mandrill who had a b.u.mp on its head from being hit suddenly charged forward. It reached out a thin arm to chase after the black smoke, strange sounds erupting from its mouth. It seemed in a great rush.Shang Que very impatiently said, \u201cDon\u2019t follow me.\u201dMandrill: \u201cHu hu\u2014\u2014\u201dShang Que: \u201cGit. I don\u2019t want a pet like you.\u201dMandrill: \u201cAo ao\u2014\u2014\u201dShang Que: \u201cThis king will call a car after leaving. I don\u2019t need a steed.\u201dEveryone present: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d What? Calling a car? Were they having auditory hallucinations?But the situation now was already developing into one n.o.body could understand. Aside from suspecting that they had all suffered from auditory hallucinations, there was no other logical explanation.While everyone was still confused, Shang Que\u2019s patience finally ran out. They watched as the thick cloud flipped over and the mandrill shot backwards from where it had previously been. It landed with a \u201cpada\u201d sound, right in front of Zheng Yan. Zheng Yan jumped with fright.Shang Que: \u201cIf you really want to be a pet so bad, then stay with him from now on.\u201dZheng Yan: \u201c!! I don\u2019t\u2026\u2026\u201dAt the same time, Zheng Dan said, \u201cThat\u2019s my monster\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que scoffed coldly. \u201cIs it yours just because you say it\u2019s yours? Is your name written on it? Call him and see if he\u2019ll respond to you?\u201dZheng Yan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Though he couldn\u2019t see a face in the black fog, this familiar language used for stealing monsters during games confirmed that this was indeed Boss.Zheng Dan even moreso: ????????Though this Great King\u2019s words didn\u2019t seem to be wrong, why did they carry the familiar feeling of\u2026\u2026being spoken by an elementary schooler?After Shang Que decided who the wild monster should go to, he left them a simple, \u201cLeaving.\u201dAnd then the dark black void completely disappeared. Clear skies returned outside the door, and light entered the room once more.The wind stopped, the clouds dissipated. Everything was normal.The room was still silent, though. Everyone\u2019s faces were filled with confusion. Some even couldn\u2019t help suspecting: had everything been a dream just now?Very soon, Zheng Yan\u2019s screeches reminded everyone: no, everything just now had been reality.They listened to Zheng Yan scream, \u201cDon\u2019t touch me\u2014\u2014\u201dWhen they looked over, they saw the originally ferocious and proud mandrill subtly, shyly trying to hold his hand.The atmosphere suddenly became incredibly awkward, especially for Zheng Shu, who had been the rudest. His face was filled with shock as he carefully looked at Zheng Yan and ingratiatingly asked, \u201cNephew, that ghost just now, was really summoned by you?\u201dZheng Yan answered while trying to avoid the mandrill\u2019s advances, \u201cYeah.\u201dActually, they didn\u2019t need to ask this question at all. That Great King had greeted Zheng Yan. The two of them seemed quite familiar with one another. Stuff like this couldn\u2019t be faked.Zheng Shu\u2019s inquiry was only a final attempt to avoid a hopeless reality.With Zheng Yan\u2019s response, he almost burst out into tears. Not only him, but all those present who had originally wanted to gain some benefits and thus spoke rudely, were now shaking in fear. They wanted to cry, but had no tears.How could they have known that Zheng Jing\u2019s son had managed to gain such a level of cultivation in such a short period of time?What happened to \u201che had no talents, he practiced for a year but didn\u2019t learn anything\u201d?He casually summoned such a powerful ghost. If this were called talentless, then wouldn\u2019t all of them be considered idiots?Zheng Shu\u2019s tone wasn\u2019t as sharp as before. He squeezed out an ugly smile with great difficulty. \u201cWho is he? Such magic hasn\u2019t been seen in the mortal realm for hundreds of years?\u201dZheng Yan put on a stern mask and faked confidence as he asked, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201dZheng Shu\u2019s lips trembled. How could he respond to this? But he also didn\u2019t dare to keep asking, terrified that the Great King would return after leaving and beat him up.If the others were only scared, Zheng Guang and Zheng Dan were both horrified and bitter.Especially Zheng Dan. Since young, he had been praised as the prodigy of the younger generation, and had been well respected by all of the Zheng Heavenly Masters. He had always been confident that given enough time, he would definitely become the official heir of the Zheng clan.In order to get the eight trigrams mirror belonging to Zheng Yan\u2019s family, his father had worked so hard in secret to gather all these people today to come and force it from their possession.But in an instant, the situation had changed completely.He had failed on the edge of victory. He was unimpressed; how could he be impressed?Zheng Dan took a step forward and blocked Zheng Yan\u2019s path. He no longer put up the modest front he had before. He clenched his teeth together and asked, \u201cHow did you invite\u2026\u2026\u2018him\u2019?\u201dAs soon as Zheng Dan asked this, everyone else belatedly remembered too. Just now, Zheng Yan hadn\u2019t performed any rituals. And only a short time pa.s.sed before the Ghost King appeared. How did he do it?Zheng Yan shook the phone in his hand and humbly explained, \u201cThis is the high-tech spell-casting that our company recommends. One press to call a ghost. More convenient, more rapid.\u201dThe Zheng Daoists present almost choked. Zheng Dan asked with an especially bewildered expression, \u201cAre you for real?\u201dZheng Shu b.u.t.t in, \u201cI understand. No wonder big brother always said our nephew was fated to be with ghosts and G.o.ds. Big brother was right. Our nephew is a true prodigy!\u201dZheng Yan turned to look at him in shock.This scammer had absolutely no shame? Even gra.s.s on top of walls didn\u2019t sway like this.Zheng Shu was used to changing the direction of the boat in accordance to the wind . He was fearful that Zheng Yan would tell on him to the Ghost King, so switched sides on the spot. He excitedly looked at Zheng Yan and said, \u201cThink about it everyone! Haven\u2019t Zheng Yan\u2019s grades been the best since elementary school? And he\u2019s the first in the Zheng clan to get into a key university ! He\u2019s a prodigy, there\u2019s no other way around it!\u201dZheng Yan\u2019s mouth twitched. That wasn\u2019t what he said before\u2026\u2026Zheng Shu said with a sincere expression, \u201cIn the past we weren\u2019t quick enough to catch on. Now I finally understand. Nephew is in with the times, unlike us oldies who are out of the times. Look at him. This is called rising abruptly because of acc.u.mulated experiences . How long has it been. His cultivation level has already surpa.s.sed all of us by who knows how much\u2026\u2026\u201dAs soon as Zheng Shu started praising him, everyone else was afraid that they would fall behind, so all agreed.\u201cI called it. With big brother\u2019s cultivation level, he would never make a mistake.\u201d\u201cAs expected from the official heir of us Zheng Heavenly Masters. With such skill, I\u2019ll bet no one else can compare\u201d\u201cWith nephew here, it\u2019s entirely likely that the Zheng Heavenly Masters can regain our former glory.\u201dZheng Yan coldly interrupted, \u201cSorry. My official job is being a product manager.\u201dZheng Shu was unbothered by his apathy. He even looked at him with admiration and said, \u201cOf course. Nephew has achieved success practicing cultivation through technological means. From now on, you\u2019ll naturally continue on this path to keep learning more and surpa.s.sing yourself.\u201dZheng Yan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dZheng Jing, who had always thought that the official Zheng Heavenly Masters\u2019 legacy would stop in his hands, felt like lamenting. He pressed down on his son\u2019s shoulders and praised, \u201cZheng Yan, in the past, Dad didn\u2019t understand you so stopped you from pursuing science. That was Dad\u2019s mistake. From now on, bravely chase after your dreams. Dad will always be your strongest support team.\u201dZheng Yan: \u201c\u2026\u2026Thank you.\u201d\u2026\u2026Luofeng headquarters. Shang Que calmly walked through the door and very unintentionally pa.s.sed Yu Zhengdu\u2019s seat. He side-eyed the other. \u201cLet\u2019s have afternoon tea together?\u201d\u201cYes yes yes.\u201d Yu Zhengdu stood up and took a cake out from the fridge. He hid in the break room with Boss to secretly eat it.Yu Zhengdu said, \u201cIt\u2019s work time right now. What we\u2019re doing currently is considered getting paid to have afternoon tea. Be more lowkey.\u201dShang Que nodded. A while later, he furrowed his brows and said, \u201cI\u2019m the boss.\u201dYu Zhengdu shushed him. \u201cDon\u2019t brag.\u201dShang Que: \u201cOkay.\u201dEither way, it didn\u2019t matter. He happily kept digging at the cake, only to see Yu Zhengdu pull out his phone while eating and send a voice message. \u201clan, I\u2019ve received your invitation. I\u2019ll definitely be there on time.\u201dShang Que: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWant to go back and beat those old Daoists up again!Coincidentally, Kang Jin walked in to get some water at this time. Upon seeing this scene, his eyes lit up. \u201cThere\u2019s cake!\u201dShang Que looked over, expression cold. \u201cYou, wage deduction.\u201dKang Jin: \u201c\u2026\u2026Why!!!\u201dThe author has something to say:At the end of the month, Luofeng distributes wages.Everyone happily start to buy yuanbao candles.Lu Lingxi: \u201cKang Jin, you owe the company two thousand.\u201dKang Jin: \u201cI request to quit.\u201dLu Lingxi: \u201cChicken.\u201dKang Jin: \u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019ll switch to asking for some nutrient potions instead qaq\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48 - Technology SummitPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 48 - Technology SummitBecause he had used his phone to summon the Ghost King with one call, Zheng Yan, who had originally been pretty much ignored among the Zheng Heavenly Masters, suddenly found his status shooting up. Those present that day to help Zheng Guang and his son bully them suddenly changed their att.i.tudes. They began praising and complimenting Zheng Yan like crazy.Actually, since entering Luofeng to work, he had gained a new understanding of the legacy of Heavenly Masters shared in his family. In his heart, he also wished that he could pa.s.s down and further promote the teachings of the Zheng Heavenly Masters. In the past, though, he had always thought of himself as lacking the talent to practice Daoism, thus believed that he would never be able to shoulder such a heavy responsibility. But with Yu Zhengdu\u2019s faith in him, followed by this situation with his family, he finally saw new hope for a change.There were thousands of roads, and all of them led to Rome. Though he couldn\u2019t cast spells, he knew how to work with technology.And besides, based on his experience at Luofeng, it was very likely that the future of cultivation would rely heavily on technology. The speech he had given to the Zheng clan\u2019s Doaists hadn\u2019t been pure bragging.Because of this, though Zheng Yan very resolutely returned to Luofeng to continue being his product manager, he no longer was so unwilling to take care of the issues at home. Consequently, the Zheng clan\u2019s collateral branches reaffirmed their willingness to follow the main family. In the blink of an eye, Zheng Yan\u2019s family status once again returned to the top.Only, Zheng Yan\u2019s father was now completely disappointed in these collateral branches. These people were never the true descendants of the Heavenly Masters and were only borrowing the Zheng clan\u2019s fame to make a living. Who knew that at such a critical moment, they would try to harm their family in such a manner. After this event, their relations.h.i.+p with the collateral branches was no longer as close as before.There were also a lot of people who tried to both subtly and obviously ask how Zheng Yan had learned scientific cultivation and suddenly been able to achieve such great results in an incredibly short amount of time. However, these people were all rejected by Zheng Yan\u2019s father.n.o.body could say anything about Zheng Jing\u2019s actions. Since historical times, the ways of cultivation practiced by each family and sect were secrets that weren\u2019t to be shared. The method was one his son had discovered, so belonged to him. n.o.body could force him to disclose it.Of course, Zheng Jing didn\u2019t do this entirely because he wanted to keep secrets. Another reason was that he had tried to talk to Zheng Yan about this new technology, but had gotten a headache from Zheng Yan\u2019s spiel regarding Internet product concepts.For example, user research, demand scenario a.n.a.lysis, minimum viable products, structural design, iterative development, growth operations, etc. made him remember those cla.s.ses he had to take in school, especially the fear he had of being forced to take mathematics and physics.Now, Zheng Jing finally realized that for Zheng Yan to have been able to get into a national key university and successfully become an exceptional product manager, his IQ was definitely superior to all the other Zheng Heavenly Masters.In the end, Zheng Jing angrily decided that he would leave the science to his son. As for himself, well, he would continue trying to figure out the knowledge their ancestors had left them.In comparison, Zheng Guang and son were a bit more unfortunate. Their plan had greatly failed; not only did they not manage to get the qiankun eight trigrams mirror, they had even lost a red-eyed mandrill. Zheng Yan had also replaced Zheng Dan in name as the family prodigy.Honestly, Zheng Yan was very exasperated too. He really didn\u2019t want that mandrill with the extraordinary appearance. But because the Ghost King had given it to him in front of everyone else, Zheng Dan and his father couldn\u2019t ask for it back either. Thus, that mandrill was determined to follow him around, refusing to leave. In the end, with no other solution, his father could only give him a little calabash gourd the size of a keychain to carry around and keep the mandrill in.***Monday, Yu Zhengdu got dressed and headed for the technology summit.This year\u2019s technology summit was to be hosted at Fu City\u2019s Ancient Well Hotel. The event sponsors were rich and unafraid to spend money, so simply rented two floors of the hotel and set up two large-scale conference halls. One was to be used in the first half for the technology discussion meeting, while the second was to be used in the latter half for the post-meeting discussion.Because the guests this year included several incredibly important people in the field, the security at the venue was also very strict. Aside from needing an invitation, guests also needed specialized servers to lead them inside.Yu Zhengdu showed his e-invite. After they scanned his barcode, a specialized server guided him into the lobby of the hall where the discussion was to be held.There was still some time left before the meeting was set to begin, but several people had arrived early in the hopes of being able to hold some more meaningful conversations with others in the field.Yu Zhengdu wasn\u2019t famous, and also looked quite young. After entering the meeting hall, not many people paid attention to him. He didn\u2019t mind this, though. He chose a seat closer to the front and was just about to sit down when he heard a familiar voice shout, \u201cZhengdu.\u201dYu Zhengdu looked up. Jiao Shanlan walked through the front door, surrounded by a swarm of people. Because Yu Zhengdu was in the row close to the door, the two of them managed to see each other immediately.Thus, Yu Zhengdu walked up and shook hands with him, slight smile on his face. \u201clandry, we meet again.\u201dA beautiful woman with a tall figure and wavy hair stood next to Jiao Shanlan. Upon seeing this, she grinned and said, \u201clandry, this is your little friend who rejected you?\u201d\u201cCan you not take this opportunity to mock me?\u201d Jiao Shanlan was very exasperated. He said to Yu Zhengdu, \u201cZhengdu, let me introduce you. This is the famous Erica, Zhao Ruola. She\u2019s also one of the main speakers today.\u201dActually, as soon as they walked in, Yu Zhengdu could already pretty much guess Zhao Ruola\u2019s ident.i.ty. At an event like this, there wouldn\u2019t be any other woman who could walk in shoulder to shoulder with Jiao Shanlan and not seem less important whatsoever.He smiled and shook hands with Zhao Ruola. \u201ch.e.l.lo, my name is Yu Zhengdu.\u201dZhao Ruola shook his hand and spoke in a teasing manner, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing else you want to say now that you\u2019ve seen me in person?\u201dYu Zhengdu couldn\u2019t really understand what she was implying, but thought about it and politely replied, \u201cI\u2019ve read the book you published,k300J;Basic Scientific Development and Future Revolutionsk300K;. It\u2019s very professional and very impressive. It inspired me greatly.\u201dZhao Ruola burst into loud laughter and finally revealed what she had meant. \u201cYou\u2019re the first person who hasn\u2019t complimented my appearance but first spoke about my work after seeing me today. As expected, landry knows how to pick them.\u201dYu Zhengdu was dazed for a moment, but realized what was going on very quickly after.Though Zhao Ruola was quite famous in their field, because of the fact that she spent most of her time working in America, there weren\u2019t many reports regarding her in their country. This, along with the fact that she didn\u2019t like to show her face, resulted in a lack of her pictures floating around online. Thus, people who didn\u2019t do some research would only think of her as some strong, iron-willed woman . As such, when they truly saw her in person, it would make sense for them to be shocked.After understanding this, Yu Zhengdu started laughing. He joked too, \u201cMy mistake, but I refuse to apologize. I just think that your achievements are more memorable than your appearance.\u201dAt this, Zhao Ruola started chuckling even louder. She honestly didn\u2019t care how people viewed her appearance or achievements, and also didn\u2019t think that being good-looking was something career-oriented women needed to avoid bringing up. But those like Yu Zhengdu, who could see both as equal, were quite rare.Zhao Ruola thought that she got along quite well with Yu Zhengdu, so couldn\u2019t help teasing him a bit. She asked, \u201cIf you aren\u2019t going to landry\u2019s laboratory, how about considering joining my team?\u201dJiao Shanlan\u2019s face immediately became dark. \u201cWhy are there humans like you who try to steal people right in front of others?\u201dYu Zhengdu asked Zhao Ruola curiously, \u201cYou\u2019ve confirmed a project?\u201dAfter the news that Zhao Ruola was quitting and returning to the country got out, an innumerous amount of famous factories and investors had their eyes on her. With her skills and influence, no matter what project she was part of, there would be plenty of people willing to spend money and give her resources.Yu Zhengdu was pretty on top of the news in their field. In his memory, he didn\u2019t recall that Zhao Ruola had made any new indications.Zhao Ruola responded, \u201cNot yet. I just want to steal you onto my team first is all.\u201dYu Zhengdu sweatdropped. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to trap a teammate without any bait.\u201dJiao Shanlan took this opportunity to ask Zhao Ruola, \u201cRecently, a lot of people have asked me about you. What are you interested in? Or, how about just joining my laboratory?\u201dZhao Ruola tsk\u2019d. \u201cWhat\u2019s so good about your laboratory? There\u2019s only a few topics investors are interested in: big data, cloud technology, AI, and other similar fields. I\u2019m sick of them.\u201dJiao Shanlan replied in exasperation, \u201cI really don\u2019t know who could successfully invite you.\u201dZhao Ruola was indifferent. \u201cIf there\u2019s somewhere I\u2019m interested in, I\u2019ll think about it. If there isn\u2019t, that just means more vacation time for me. I\u2019m not a workaholic. Isn\u2019t it nice to have some time off to relax?\u201dJiao Shanlan said, \u201cFine fine fine.\u201dZhao Ruola still wanted to keep talking with Yu Zhengdu, but she was one of the most important people tonight. There were still an abundance of high-level administrators and investors who were waiting to speak with her, so she got dragged away by the event staff.After Jiao Shanlan and Zhao Ruola left, Yu Zhengdu, who had originally been ignored by everyone, suddenly became high in demand. Though most people didn\u2019t recognize him, just the fact that he could hold a private conversation with Jiao Shanlan and Zhao Ruola proved that he didn\u2019t have an ordinary ident.i.ty.Thus, a swarm of people instantly surrounded Yu Zhengdu, trying to speak with him. It was a good thing that he was already prepared. He took out a stack of his business cards to exchange with them.But after receiving his cards, these people read the company\u2019s name and realized that they didn\u2019t recognize it all, thus all fell into deep thought.There were some sly ones who took out their phones to do a search on the company. Not soon after, the crowd around Yu Zhengdu had mostly dissipated. It could be said that they were very realistic.Yu Zhengdu didn\u2019t care, though. He went back to his seat and started sharing what he had witnessed today with Boss.Yu Zhengdu:\u3010Xiao Shang, guess who I just saw!!!\u3011Shang Que replied instantly. It was so fast that he started to suspect if Boss had just been staring at his phone this whole time.My broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010\u2026\u2026Laboratory?\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010= = No.\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010Zhao Ruola!\u3011My broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010The author of\u300aBasic Scientific Development and Future Revolutions\u300b?\u3011Yu Zhengdu was completely shocked:\u3010You read that too???????\u3011My broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010Don\u2019t you keep it next to your computer\u2026\u2026\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010Oh, you\u2019re right.\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010I like her so much! She\u2019s definitely top-tier in terms of skills. Ah, I hope I can interact with her some more later\u3011My broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010Don\u2019t you think you like too many people?\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010No?\u3011My broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010[Link][Link][Link][Link][Link]\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Why do you still have these links saved\u3011Weren\u2019t these the replies he had given in the past on Fu City University\u2019s forum regarding the CP votings\u2026\u2026Yu Zhengdu:\u3010Ey, these were all fake responses\u3011After seeing this reply, Shang Que\u2019s mood immediately become much better. But that only lasted a second. Very soon after, it dropped again.Yu Zhengdu:\u3010None of them can compare to Zhao Ruola\u3011My broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010\u2026\u2026\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010Oh, right. Zhao Ruola is super pretty in person. Both good-looking and skilled, I admire that\u3011My broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010Have you considered laboratory\u2019s feelings?! He\u2019s the one who gave you the invite\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010Ah?\u3011Wait, he couldn\u2019t understand Boss\u2019s logic?Yu Zhengdu was just about to ask again, when he was interrupted by someone suddenly greeting him. \u201ch.e.l.lo.\u201dYu Zhengdu looked up and found that this person was someone who had been in the crowd following Jiao Shanlan and Zhao Ruola just now. He was pretty tall, but only looked to be around twenty years old. However, his hair was already starting to thin out.Yu Zhengdu reached the swift conclusion: Tech-geek, a tech-geek who was probably pretty skilled too.As expected, this person introduced himself and said, \u201cMy name is Tang Min. I\u2019m a member of Nova\u2019s pioneering laboratory.\u201d\u201ch.e.l.lo,\u201d Yu Zhengdu hurriedly returned a greeting.The two exchanged business cards. Yu Zhengdu finally realized that Tang Min was the youngest member of Jiao Shanlan\u2019s laboratory team. He had just graduated from a famous university in America last year, and could be considered outstanding among his peers.Tang Min casually chatted with him for a bit, then suddenly changed the topic. He said, \u201cI heard landry wanted to ask you to join his pioneering laboratory in the past?\u201dThis wasn\u2019t a secret, so Yu Zhengdu nodded. \u201cI had some personal matters, so couldn\u2019t go. A pity.\u201dTang Min laughed. It was hard to tell what he meant. \u201cSo it\u2019s true. No wonder people always say I got lucky because of you.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Ah, this familiar sour scent.He immediately understood why Tang Min had come to find him, but didn\u2019t want to start an argument with Jiao Shanlan\u2019s employee. Besides, probably because he had encountered similar situations too many times before, he could somewhat understand how Tang Min felt.He smiled and said, \u201cWhy do you care what others have to say. Is being able to join landry\u2019s laboratory a matter of luck?\u201dTang Min realized that Yu Zhengdu was trying to avoid conflict, so didn\u2019t try to keep provoking him. He shrugged, \u201cI think so too.\u201dAfter, he glanced at Yu Zhengdu\u2019s business card again. \u201cI\u2019ve never even heard of the company you\u2019re at now. What do they do?\u201dYu Zhengdu smiled faintly, \u201cYou can find that information online.\u201dHe originally thought that he had portrayed his reluctance to continue chatting fairly obviously, but the logic of tech-geek homebodies was so straightforward it was shocking. Upon hearing this, Tang Min actually pulled out his phone on the spot and searched online.Yu Zhengdu: Speechless!But what made him more speechless was what followed. Tang Min finished reading Luofeng\u2019s information on their official website and started laughing. \u201cWhat kind of company have you gone to? I thought that you would have joined some important project after rejecting landry\u2019s invitation? How come you\u2019ve gone to work on pyramid schemes?\u201dYu Zhengdu very seriously stated, \u201cWe are an official business with official products. We have files with the government.\u201dTang Min immediately burst out into laughter. \u201cThese count as official products?\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dTang Min shook his head while scrolling. He kept tsk\u2019ing. \u201cAnd here I was wondering how amazing you truly were. But it turns out this is all you do. Do you even have clients? Or do you just sell these to old people?\u201dHe was still blundering on when another swarm of people drew closer. As everyone watched, the people at the center of the crowd stopped in front of Yu Zhengdu.Tang Min glanced at them. The ones who had just arrived were two of the sponsors of this grand technology summit: the CEO of Double Horn Technology, Wei Xiao, and Cui Jianlan from Wind Riders Technology.Cui Jianlan very familiarly greeted Yu Zhengdu, \u201cXiao Yu, long time no see.\u201dWei Xiao cheerily said too, \u201cWe originally were going to look for you after the discussion, but Lao Cui was worried that you would be too busy later and run off. He was adamant about coming over to say hi first.\u201dEver since Luofeng had officially started the development of the Life and Death Accounts system, the job of directly communicating with Wei Xiao and these important clients got completely transferred to the operations department. It truly had been a while since the last time Yu Zhengdu had contacted them.Cui Jianlan said, \u201cIsn\u2019t that so. I heard Xiao Yu\u2019s been working on a new product recently, so obviously had to hurry and say something to try and be the first to test it out.\u201dYu Zhengdu smiled and responded, \u201cYou\u2019re all VIPs, so don\u2019t need to say anything. If we release any new products, we\u2019ll definitely recommend them to you first.\u201dThese two bosses then continued down the topic of new products to chat with Yu Zhengdu for a few more minutes, not leaving until the staff reminded them that the discussion was about to start soon.After they left, Yu Zhengdu could finally sit down. He finally realized that Tang Min was still next to him, staring at him in bewilderment. He asked, \u201cWei Xiao and Cui Jianlan are your company\u2019s clients?\u201dYu Zhengdu nodded and very professionally stated, \u201cYes. VIPs, the kind that get special one-on-one service.\u201dTang Min: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe author has something to say:Tang Min: Please definitely sell me a set!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49 - Three Big Cheeses of the ForumPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 49 - Three Big Cheeses of the ForumAn announcement through the speakers in the meeting hall reminded everyone that the discussion was about to begin and that they should take their seats. The staff started to maintain order.Tang Min stared at Yu Zhengdu. He looked like he wanted to speak, but ultimately couldn\u2019t say anything. He left bitterly.Yu Zhengdu watched his somewhat desolate figure depart. He didn\u2019t know if this was just an illusion, but he felt that the other\u2019s hair seemed even more wispy.Yu Zhengdu lamented to himself a bit before finally sitting down. He picked up the schedule for the summit that the organizers had provided and looked over what was planned for today. He couldn\u2019t help but admit that there was a lot of quality content in this year\u2019s technology summit. Simply the list of speakers for today included Jiao Shanlan and Zhao Ruola, both individuals who rarely showed up in public.The topics for discussion were very advanced too. Just from their summaries, one could tell that they held a lot of interesting content. And, to better accomplish the goal of discussion, every lead speaker had fifteen minutes to answer questions after their talk. This made Yu Zhengdu, who was mainly here to learn about new technological trends, look forward to the event much more.As expected, as soon as the discussion started, the atmosphere in the room immediately became heated. Those that received invitations this time were either high-level administrators of large corporations or the best talents in each company. Many were here with the goals of learning and communicating. They weren\u2019t interested in only listening to the main speakers\u2019 perspectives; they had lots of their own thoughts and responses they wanted to share.As one of the organizers of this summit, Jiao Shanlan was the first to speak. The subject he discussed was related to the pioneering laboratory he was working on. He introduced the direction his laboratory planned to take in the future. One reason was to share his intentions, while the other was to send a signal to all the partic.i.p.ants here today to garner the attention of skilled and interested individuals to join.Unsurprisingly, after he spoke, the Q&amp;A segment was exceptionally intense. Several technicians were eager to ask questions. Some of them truly had feedback, but there were also a lot who took the opportunity to recommend themselves.After Jiao Shanlan, two other high-level administrators from different companies spoke. They took much less time, only reporting on some technological problems they had made further advancements in. But in comparison to a large factory like Nova, the fields they worked in were relatively average. The overall response was much less lively when compared to Jiao Shanlan\u2019s.The organizers were obviously very experienced, as they had planned for these kinds of situations in advance. They had scheduled the order of guest speakers in a very particular manner. Thus, the atmosphere was only low for a brief period of time before welcoming a new climax. It was time for Zhao Ruola to speak.The topic Zhao Ruola had prepared for today was very different from what everyone had expected. She didn\u2019t discuss any of the currently popular trends. Instead, she returned to her roots and started discussing some basics. The t.i.tle was\u300aBasic Science, Policies, Resources, Humanity, and the Future\u300b.Zhao Ruola had a captivating physical appearance. As soon as she stepped onstage, she garnered everyone\u2019s attention. The media invited to cover this event also immediately glued their camera lenses onto her. She wasn\u2019t shy either, simply granting them a dignified smile and waving her hand in greeting.\u201cEveryone must be a little lost after seeing my chosen topic today, right?\u201d Zhao Ruola used her laser pointer to point at the t.i.tle page of her powerpoint. She smiled and said, \u201cI originally wanted to discuss cloud technology and some issues with smart cities with everyone, but I was pretty inspired by some interesting posts I saw on starflicker a while ago, so decided to switch directions. Today, we are going to start with these posts and discuss some societal problems.\u201dAs soon as she brought up starflicker, everyone started whispering to each other offstage. Several programmers had already begun heated discussions among themselves.Zhao Ruola: \u201cIt seems that everyone already knows which posts I\u2019m talking about?\u201dSomeone who had no brain to mouth filter replied, \u201cThe battle posts between the three big cheeses of metaphysics?\u201dAs soon as he spoke, everyone immediately started laughing. They weren\u2019t mocking him; instead, it was out of a sort of like-minded understanding. There was that hint of kindness that only people within the field comprehended.Zhao Ruola grinned and nodded. \u201cYes.\u201dstarflicker was one of the top technological discussion forums in the nation. Several high quality posts originated from it. Some of the perspectives regarding technology posted on it had also been compiled into a book and published. It could be said that out of all the technicians present today, a majority of them either currently were or previously had been users of starflicker. They all knew at least a little in regards to the more popular topics on the forum.In the past two years, following the influx of several students with no actual experience joining starflicker, the quality of the posts on the forum had gone down a bit. A lot of older users had left, too. But recently, because of a few posts that appeared quite strange, starflicker once again entered the field of vision of these professionals.Those posts were created by the famous user, singer. The topics all seemed unrelated to Internet technology and included, but weren\u2019t limited to, how to use programming to integrate in the choice for a newborn\u2019s birthdate, the relations.h.i.+p between karma and humanized guidance, etc.The most shocking one amongst them was called: Hypothesize that the overall number of souls of living beings remain at a constant quant.i.ty. How would one determine population distribution according to the overall amount of resources available in society?Hypothesize\u2026\u2026souls of living beings\u2026\u2026overall number\u2026\u2026constant\u2026\u2026Though there was a \u201chypothesize\u201d in the beginning, it wasn\u2019t enough to cover up the fact that this topic was full of supernatural influence.But, just when everyone thought that singer had gone crazy because of his work in science and started down the inglorious path of metaphysics, the other experts on the forum suddenly joined in to begin a debate.Theyk2026;k2026;they actually started seriously discussing it.Among them, the most active and advanced were the two other experts, lan and osone. And also because of this, the two of them plus singer were jokingly called starflicker\u2019s three big cheeses of metaphysics.The battle between the three cheeses of metaphysics and other big V\u2019s was metaphorically the same as the sword battle of Mt. Hua . This immediately caught the attention of a large amount of people. Several of these arguments also got reposted onto other parts of the Internet. Even those old users who had left for many years suddenly returned to watch the battle.Because of this, as soon as Zhao Ruola brought up starflicker posts, this, in addition to her strange t.i.tle, allowed everyone to instantly guess which posts she was talking about.With this foundation, Zhao Ruola\u2019s speech immediately received much more attention. But in actuality, she was only using these posts as an introductory hook. Most of what she discussed later was in regards to the possible future influence of advanced technological trends on the entirety of human society.Because this was a relatively public event, Zhao Ruola didn\u2019t try to purposefully mystify the concepts. She explained these profound concepts in simplified terms. Not soon after, the entire meeting hall became silent. Everyone was completely enraptured, all their attention focused on the information she was sharing.At the end of her speech, Zhao Ruola suddenly switched topics and returned to the posts she had brought up in the beginning. She smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m sure everyone has heard of the phrase: The end of technology is theology. But I believe a more accurate wording of this would be: The end of human technology is theology. Because the human consciousness is limited, but true science is unlimited. With the progress we\u2019ve made in technology now, we are still unable to completely explain all the occurrences humans have experienced. Thus, we can only fit them all into the category of theology.\u201d\u201cIncluding singer\u2019s most debated question: Hypothesize that the overall number of souls of living beings remain at a constant quant.i.ty. I think\u2026\u2026\u201d She faintly smiled, \u201cPerhaps, this isn\u2019t only a hypothetical model?\u201dHer conclusion once again earned everyone\u2019s laughter. It must be known that those present today were the most loyal materialists in the country.After Zhao Ruola\u2019s official talk ended, it was time for the Q&amp;A segment once again. But probably because of the vast influence of those posts on the forum, the first two people who spoke both started discussing the posts. After hearing two consecutive questions, Yu Zhengdu finally couldn\u2019t help himself. He raised his hand too.As soon as Zhao Ruola noticed he had raised his hand, she smiled and pointed at him, giving him the chance to speak.Yu Zhengdu grabbed the microphone and somewhat shyly added on to what the other two had already said. \u201cActually, the hypothetical conditions on those posts weren\u2019t complete yet. This also caused a lot of bias in later discussions. For example, \u2018Hypothesize that the overall number of souls of living beings remain at a constant quant.i.ty.\u2019 The basis of this post is lacking\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu summarized the contents of the post, along with the additions from the other experts, then shared some corrections he made to the hypothetical conditions. His summary was very detailed. It was easy to tell that he truly had a deep understanding of technology.But because the problem itself was hypothetical, and because a lot of very influential experts had already expressed their opinions on it, while some people could listen to his thoughts calmly and carefully, others were already riled up.Especially the two who had spoken before him. They had spoken under the premise that the post had been correct. Yu Zhengdu\u2019s speech was basically directly condemning them as wrong.This was a public opportunity to show one\u2019s face. There were important people like Jiao Shanlan and Zhao Ruola present. Everyone knew that these two were in the middle of hiring new workers for their own teams. Those who spoke now were more or less trying to catch their attention.Because of this, some people didn\u2019t even bother listening to what Yu Zhengdu was saying in detail. They were only waiting for him to finish speaking. The person who spoke before him immediately stood up and retorted, \u201cI believe that your opinion contains too much subjective speculation\u2026\u2026To be more direct, you think a little too highly of yourself.\u201dThose who could attend today were all people who had at least some skills. Because of this, a lot of them were used to being praised by others. They were naturally more arrogant, and Yu Zhengdu was honestly too young. Just from age alone, he was probably the least experienced out of everyone present.But from certain angles, the technological field was also the most honest and realistic field\u2014\u2014it only respected the truly skilled.Under this premise, from the moment Yu Zhengdu had stood up, many people had already prematurely concluded that he didn\u2019t have enough experience. His words, then, would also cause people to believe that this was only a young person trying to appear better than he actually was.In regards to questions of technology, Yu Zhengdu had always been respectful and careful. Upon hearing such a rude comment, he didn\u2019t feel angry. Instead, he answered very seriously, \u201cI\u2019m only bringing up the points that I think should be fixed. Technological concepts become more clear the more they\u2019re debated. If you have any questions about my opinion, you can ask them. We can have a discussion.\u201dThat person hadn\u2019t actually listened to Yu Zhengdu\u2019s comments. In the moment that Yu Zhengdu had rejected his perspective, he had already started coming up with a way to regain the upper hand. \u201cI think that young people need to spend more time learning before speaking up. You shouldn\u2019t try to appear better than you are after only learning some basic concepts\u2026\u2026\u201dHe specially glanced at Zhao Ruola. Though Zhao Ruola hadn\u2019t publicly announced her plans after coming back to the country yet, from the commotion her return caused in the field, the resources she could receive in the future definitely wouldn\u2019t be any less than those Jiao Shanlan\u2019s pioneering laboratory had received. Right now, the team members for Jiao Shanlan\u2019s laboratory had pretty much already been decided. Unless someone was exceptional, it would be hard to join at this point. But there was still a chance with Zhao Ruola.He noticed that Zhao Ruola looked like she was deep in thought, which ascertained his idea of needing to regain the upper hand. \u201cRegarding the post that you used as an example, singer and the other technological experts have already had a detailed debate\u2026\u2026\u201dThe words flowed from his mouth like water through a river. He spoke confidently, re-summarizing and reorganizing what the other experts had said in the post. It was easy to tell that he truly had spent quite some time looking over and trying to understand what they had been talking about. \u201c\u2026\u2026Most importantly, I don\u2019t know if you saw singer\u2019s last reply. He already designed a model based on the results of everyone\u2019s discussions. He operationalized it with the actual data. What level is singer on? I\u2019m sure everyone seated here today already knows. If anything was wrong with the model, he would\u2019ve talked about it long ago. Or, do you think that you\u2019re more skilled than singer?\u201dIn the end, his tone was more or less mocking.The atmosphere was a little strange because of his words. Actually, when Yu Zhengdu had first started speaking, though many people didn\u2019t agree with him, because of his firm grasp of these technological concepts, they all diligently listened to his argument. Yet, those posts on the forum themselves were out of the ordinary. And, the hypothetical scenarios during the battle on the forum had already surpa.s.sed everyone\u2019s current knowledge.Consequently, a lot of people could only somewhat understand that Yu Zhengdu\u2019s perspective contained some good points. But in such a short period of time, they wouldn\u2019t be able to accurately verify whether or not he was right.This person had spoken a lot. His conclusion, though, was simple and straight to the point: someone on singer\u2019s level has already tested this. If you want to refute him, please first confirm that you\u2019re better than singer.This made everything very awkward. Aside from the truly top tier individuals present, such as Jiao Shanlan, Zhao Ruola, etc. probably n.o.body dared to say that they were better than singer.\u2026\u2026Of course, not including Yu Zhengdu.Only, Yu Zhengdu himself felt very awkward too. He had never expected that the other would be so confident in singer. Though it was very likely that he only wanted to use singer as a means of proving himself right, this still made things quite difficult for Yu Zhengdu.Yu Zhengdu didn\u2019t like the feeling of being put higher than everyone else. Thus, he had never publicly shared his ident.i.ty as singer. But, he really hadn\u2019t thought that one day, someone would use his own perspective to disprove him.He couldn\u2019t help but summarize to himself in his heart: could this be the legendary setting one\u2019s own spear onto one\u2019s own s.h.i.+eld ?If he had known it would end up like this earlier, he would\u2019ve announced that he was singer before he started speaking. If he said it now, it would be a little discourteous to the other brother.Yu Zhengdu hesitated a bit, then politely said, \u201cI think, singer\u2019s perspective might not be completely accurate. Especially in regards to this post. There are actually a lot of mistakes\u2026\u2026\u201dAs soon as he said this, before the person who had been debating with him could say anything, someone else was already more unimpressed.Wispy hair-Tang Min very agitatedly said, \u201cBulls.h.i.+t! singer could never be wrong!\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Why did his tone make him sound so much like a fan?Tang Min rolled his eyes very exaggeratedly at him. \u201cI\u2019ve carefully read all of singer\u2019s posts. His skills are definitely top tier, including that last model he designed. If I had to use two words to comment on it, they would be \u2018completely perfect\u2019. If you can\u2019t beat singer in terms of technological skill, you aren\u2019t qualified to criticize him.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d He really was a fan ah.But what could he say, this wasn\u2019t actually that surprising. It was pretty normal for technological homebodies with only one nerve like Tang Min to blindly wors.h.i.+p technological experts. Thinking back on how he had pulled out his phone and looked up Yu Zhengdu\u2019s company on the spot, then criticized it, and now seeing how he directly jumped out to fight for his idol, Yu Zhengdu couldn\u2019t help but think that this was very\u2026\u2026accordant with his style.Yu Zhengdu\u2019s entire person was lost. As soon as a fan like Tang Min appeared, this debate was destined to be out of the ordinary. He guessed that no matter what he said from now on, Tang Min would only rebuke him\u2026\u2026In the recent past, he had seen something similar to this before, when Shang Que had been involved in the big fight on Weibo. Netizens typically called these people: toxic solo fans .Luckily, at this crucial moment, Jiao Shanlan stood up and yelled at Tang Min, \u201cSit down first.\u201dAs soon as Jiao Shanlan spoke, everyone\u2019s attention got drawn over to him.But the frankness of technological homebodies sometimes couldn\u2019t even be controlled by their superiors. Tang Min stubbornly said, \u201cWait a moment. I want to hear him finish speaking. If he can\u2019t convince me, I hope that he can apologize to singer\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dJiao Shanlan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dJiao Shanlan glanced at Yu Zhengdu, asking for his approval. Yu Zhengdu could only wave in resignation.Finally, Jiao Shanlan couldn\u2019t take it anymore. \u201cHe is singer.\u201dAfter Jiao Shanlan said this, the crowd went into an uproar with a \u201chong\u2014\u2014\u201d. Tang Min especially couldn\u2019t react in time. He went huh and asked, \u201cWho? Who\u2019s singer?\u201dYu Zhengdu facepalmed in exasperation. \u201cI\u2019m singer.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already operationalized the questions in those posts on starflicker. The problems that still remain are the ones I just brought up. Including the one I was just talking about. I also designed a model, but because of the issues I mentioned before, there are imperfections with the model\u2019s base. In the month after, my team and I spent a lot of time trying to fix it, but even until now, we haven\u2019t resolved all the problems. Because I was worried that I would mislead everyone, and because I really haven\u2019t had time to recently, I haven\u2019t shared the newest circ.u.mstances onto the forum yet\u2026\u2026\u201dAs soon as Jiao Shanlan and Yu Zhengdu finished speaking, everyone became shocked into a stupor.Especially Tang Min and the person who had rebuked Yu Zhengdu before. Who would\u2019ve thought, they had used singer\u2019s perspective to argue with Yu Zhengdu for such a long time, but in the end, Yu Zhengdu was singer.And everyone else was extremely excited. Those in the field had many guesses in regards to the true ident.i.ties of the experts on starflicker. The three big cheeses of metaphysics, in particular, were a main focal point for everyone\u2019s postulations. Who would\u2019ve thought that today, they could see singer in person.Though the media here weren\u2019t tech professionals, from the crowd\u2019s reaction, they could tell that Yu Zhengdu\u2019s online ident.i.ty was remarkable. They immediately turned their lenses onto him.Tang Min was completely dazed. He stared at Yu Zhengdu for a long time but couldn\u2019t say anything.But another person still maintained his last bit of reasoning, especially now that all of the media\u2019s cameras were facing this direction. He felt even more embarra.s.sed. He forced himself to say, \u201cEven so, you can only prove your own perspective. There were so many incredible people who also commented on that post. Like osone. osone brought up a lot of arguments. You mean to say osone was wrong too?\u201dRight after he finished speaking, main guest speaker Zhao Ruola, who had been watching everything unfold off to the side, suddenly said, \u201cI think, osone would agree with singer\u2019s views too.\u201dThat person froze. Reflexively, he asked, \u201cWhy?\u201dZhao Ruola smiled, \u201cBecause I am osone.\u201dThe scene went into an uproar.That person: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThat person hadn\u2019t expected for this blow to be consecutive. He felt his vision go black. In a last attempt, he said, \u201cBut, there\u2019s still lan\u2026\u2026\u201dJiao Shanlan slowly expressed, \u201cI am lan. I agree with singer as well.\u201dEveryone present: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThat person: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dTriple kill, accomplished.The uproar caused by the crowd was enough to raise the roof.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50 - Insight of TechnologyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 50 - Insight of TechnologyThere were a lot of famous people on the starflicker forum, but the three big cheeses of metaphysics were definitely the ones that garnered the most attention. Several postulations regarding lan, osone, and singer\u2019s true ident.i.ties had been made by the public. Though they hadn\u2019t been able to guess correctly in the end, what they could confirm was that with their skills and knowledge, they definitely worked at the top factories. A lot of people had guessed Cosmic Factory, but n.o.body had dared to actually suspect Jiao Shanlan.Who would\u2019ve thought that at today\u2019s summit, they would unexpectedly be able to witness the true ident.i.ties behind all of their masks simultaneously. For the technological field that always admired the skilled, this was the equivalent of a large festival. In mere seconds, the atmosphere at the scene could be considered white-hot.The media were also beyond excited. Regardless of whether they understood technology or not, they could all tell from the atmosphere what a moment this was. All the cameras were locked onto Jiao Shanlan, Zhao Ruola, and Yu Zhengdu\u2019s figures, switching between the three. There were even reporters who had already taken out their phones and started typing out headlines, terrified that if they sent out the news a second too late, someone else would take the chance to first.Zhao Ruola c.o.c.ked an eyebrow and smiled as she said, \u201cI hadn\u2019t expected that singer himself would also be present. Since this is the case, I\u2019m sure that n.o.body would mind if I invited him onstage to discuss the problems he just mentioned?\u201dZhao Ruola\u2019s status was top-tier. Yu Zhengdu also had the reputation of singer helping him. As soon as she suggested this, obviously no one present had any objections. Under these circ.u.mstances, the event coordinators also wouldn\u2019t refuse.Honestly, if only Yu Zhengdu had been revealed to be singer, though everyone would have been shocked, after time for consideration, they likely wouldn\u2019t have been truly impressed.As famous as singer was on the forum, as skilled as he was, that was only an ID on the forum. A lot of people\u2019s respect for him was built on the prediction that he was some high-level admin at a top-tier technology factory. After his true ident.i.ty was revealed, a lot of people\u2019s first reactions were: so singer was only an irrelevant young child.But after Zhao Ruola and Jiao Shanlan also revealed their ident.i.ties and publicly expressed their support for Yu Zhengdu, things were different.If even the two of them agreed with singer, that could only prove that one shouldn\u2019t pay too much attention to the origins of heroes. singer truly was very skilled.Thus, everyone\u2019s original suspicions towards Yu Zhengdu transformed into their antic.i.p.ation for his perspective on the question at hand.It was hard to reject such an eager audience, so Yu Zhengdu could only walk onstage and grab the microphone from the MC. He apologetically smiled, \u201cI hadn\u2019t expected that so many people would be paying attention to and following those posts. In order to avoid misunderstandings, I will briefly share with everyone the results and problems of my operalization as well as what I\u2019ve tried to do to solve them\u2026\u2026\u201dAll the media\u2019s cameras were focused on him. Everyone in the audience was paying attention too.Yu Zhengdu was naturally respectful towards technology. He was also very supportive of discussing and sharing his findings with others with an open and understanding att.i.tude. Especially under the circ.u.mstances that a few of his posts had already become so influential in the entire field. This way, he could give more people the correct guidelines.Consequently, he didn\u2019t hide anything. He glossed over the information that was related to the secrets of h.e.l.l and reincarnation and used the simplest method possible to explain the results of his modelling and subsequent revisions.As Yu Zhengdu shared more of his a.n.a.lysis report, the expressions of the audience members at the event slowly transformed into shock.Actually, when everyone had first seen the posts on the forum, though they were surprised by how skilled the experts were, they hadn\u2019t really taken things seriously. The problem was, the posts themselves were all hypothetical scenarios. In the eyes of many people, these topics weren\u2019t actually operational.But now, they were truly hearing the results of their operationalization.Yet, this wasn\u2019t what was the most astounding. What truly shocked them the most was that the database in the model Yu Zhengdu was speaking of was so large, with so many conditions, that even considering the \u201cbig data\u201d that all large companies were fanatical about today, his numbers still caused people to become stunned.Such a large database could probably only currently be worked with by the top 2 factories in the nation.Even Jiao Shanlan and Zhao Ruola couldn\u2019t help the surprised looks on their faces.Yu Zhengdu used his best judgement and decided to stop talking after sharing his model and the concepts behind the database. Everyone present still wanted to hear more, but no one dared to cause a commotion to try and get him to keep talking. Those with even the slightest bit of sense recognized that the field his company was dabbling in was out of the scope of their curiosity. It was already a blessing that he was willing to share some purely skill-oriented facts.Many started to whisper among themselves, all trying to figure out Yu Zhengdu\u2019s background and the company he was currently working at. The people who exchanged business cards with him at the start of the meeting all took out his business card and started to re-a.n.a.lyze his company.And then they once again fell into a round of confusion.Just\u2026\u2026no matter how they looked at it, this still seemed like a suspicious small company that dealt in health management!There were also a few individuals who knew that Jiao Shanlan\u2019s laboratory had once invited Yu Zhengdu but been rejected. Now, they spoke of this gossip once more.\u201c\u2026\u2026No wonder he rejected landry\u2019s invitation. If the company he\u2019s at now can really work with the amount of data he says they can, they\u2019re not worse than Nova Factory\u2019s laboratory at all.\u201d\u201cYou can say that, but look at their company\u2019s products\u2026\u2026A health management company can really work with numbers of this scope?\u201d\u201cBut I just went over the verification process he brought up in detail. They\u2019re all accurate. He most likely isn\u2019t faking it.\u201dObviously, the quality level of the content that Yu Zhengdu shared was extremely different from the products listed on Luofeng\u2019s current website. It caused great confusion among the audience members present.But the one thing that could be confirmed was, no matter what business their company was dabbling in, their technological skills had already been recognized by everyone.Amidst the heated discussions, there were also those who acted completely calm, expressions mysterious as they shared inside information with others.Wei Xiao subtly told the person next to him, \u201cThe stuff that Xiao Yu\u2019s company is working on is probably more impressive than anyone can predict\u2026\u2026\u201dThe person next to him hadn\u2019t expected for Wei Xiao to be familiar with this company. He couldn\u2019t help leaning in closer to whisper, \u201cWhat are they working on?\u201dWei Xiao\u2019s expression was full of untold secrets. \u201cMy guess is, it\u2019s probably related to the development of ecological balance and sustainability of natural resources in our nation\u2026\u2026\u201dThe person next to him suddenly understood. \u201cIf so, then it truly is possible for them to have so much data.\u201dWei Xiao nodded, tone filled with praise. \u201cLuofeng is a company that feels a lot of social responsibility.\u201d\u2026\u2026Because the three big cheeses of starflicker who had been the subjects of everyone\u2019s guessing had suddenly revealed their true ident.i.ties, the atmosphere of the discussion reached a new climax. Especially for Yu Zhengdu, who practically achieved instant fame. He suddenly became one of the most sought after individuals in the room, not even paling in comparison to Jiao Shanlan or Zhao Ruola.After the discussion ended, the guests all took a moment to collect themselves before being led to the other room on a different floor. This was the location of the post-meeting congregation.The after party was in the style of a self-serve buffet. This way, people could communicate freely. The atmosphere was also more relaxed in comparison to before.As soon as he walked in, several people tried to talk to Yu Zhengdu, but after seeing who he was surrounded by, they silently gave up on this thought.Only to see Yu Zhengdu standing with Zhao Ruola, Jiao Shanlan, and the others. This circle of experts wasn\u2019t one that the ordinary person could go near. Those that had exchanged business cards with Yu Zhengdu before the meeting were slightly better off, because they had at least met him once, so could use this as an excuse to chat with him after the summit. But those who had completely ignored him in the beginning were now immensely regretful.When Yu Zhengdu had been revealing his true ident.i.ty, he had already predicted this would happen. Yet, the eagerness of everyone still exceeded his expectations. This was all because he had made too big of an impact after Zhao Ruola had suddenly called him onstage.But since he saw ghosts on a regular basis, Yu Zhengdu\u2019s mentality was much braver than before. He wasn\u2019t that worried about the current situation, instead following his original plan of exchanging ideas with Zhao Ruola and the others.\u201cI didn\u2019t think that you would be singer. And here I was, wondering why landry was so adamant about hiring you.\u201d Zhao Ruola looked at Jiao Shanlan with disdain. \u201cSo you knew long ago. But didn\u2019t even think to tell me.\u201dJiao Shanlan was very innocent. \u201cYou never asked me.\u201dZhao Ruola observed Yu Zhengdu again, lamenting, \u201cYou\u2019re too young. In the past I always thought that singer was some bald old guy\u2026\u2026\u201dUnexpectedly, not only was he not an old guy, he even had a lot of hair.Yu Zhengdu sweatdropped and waved his hands. \u201cI always thought you were a man with a long beard.\u201dZhao Ruola snorted. \u201cWhere did you get that a.s.sumption?\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201cAren\u2019t you always smoking in the forum?\u201dZhao Ruola: \u201c\u2026\u2026Isn\u2019t that just an emoji?\u201dYu Zhengdu held his hands out. \u201cWell you use it too realistically!\u201dTheir gathering was the equivalent of Internet friends meeting in real life. They reminisced their conversations online and teased each other once more before finally returning onto the topic of technology.Zhao Ruola seemed particularly interested in Luofeng\u2019s work. She kept hounding Yu Zhengdu and asked a lot of questions. She was purely obsessed with technology; in only such a short amount of time, she had already come to several new conclusions by herself and, throughout the inquiry process, had given Yu Zhengdu new insights.But as her questions became more in-depth, Yu Zhengdu stopped answering and said, \u201cThat\u2019s our company\u2019s secret. I can\u2019t tell you.\u201dZhao Ruola still wasn\u2019t completely satisfied, but could only regretfully say, \u201cGiven the opportunity, I would love to see your company\u2019s backend data.\u201dYu Zhengdu joked, \u201cWouldn\u2019t that be easy? We\u2019re missing a lot of people at our company. If you want to see it, just come work for us.\u201dHe was only casually saying this. With Luofeng\u2019s current capabilities, it was impossible to invite a person on Zhao Ruola\u2019s level to work for them. But unexpectedly, Zhao Ruola didn\u2019t immediately refuse. Instead, she pondered a bit and smiled. \u201cThat depends on if you guys have anything that\u2019s more interesting to me.\u201dAt first, Yu Zhengdu was bewildered. Soon after, though, he regained his wits.Jiao Shanlan was shocked too. He said, \u201cNo way, you\u2019re seriously considering it?\u201dJiao Shanlan was more familiar with Zhao Ruola than Yu Zhengdu was. He very clearly understood that she never casually spoke about her decisions regarding technology.Zhao Ruola used her hand to strike a pose like she was smoking a cigarette. She cooly asked, \u201cWhy not?\u201dYu Zhengdu was lost in thought. \u201c Un , why not?\u201dMany people naturally a.s.sumed that with Zhao Ruola\u2019s experience, she would definitely choose to work with a famous factory after returning to the country. Or, she would accept sponsors from venture capitalists and start her own independent project.But regardless of if it was the osone that Yu Zhengdu had interacted with on the forum or the Zhao Ruola that he had gotten to understand in this short amount of time today, he had come to realize that Zhao Ruola\u2019s pursuit of technology was far greater than her pursuit of sponsors.h.i.+ps and investment returns.This was possibly the reason she still hadn\u2019t publicly shared her intentions. The current environment that sponsors could provide for her weren\u2019t enough to capture her interest yet.After realizing this, Yu Zhengdu\u2019s expression became serious. He very sincerely invited her, \u201cHow about, I\u2019ll schedule a time for you to come to our company and understand things in more detail?\u201dZhao Ruola laughed loudly. \u201cOkay.\u201dUpon seeing this, Jiao Shanlan immediately became unhappy. \u201cZhengdu, it\u2019s fine that you aren\u2019t joining my laboratory, but how come you\u2019re fighting with me for people now?\u201dAs soon as he finished speaking, he saw Tang Min hesitantly inch forward. He greeted Jiao Shanlan, then awkwardly stuck his phone in front of Yu Zhengdu. There was a QR code displayed on it. 'singer, can I add you on WeChat?\u201dJiao Shanlan\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201c\u2026\u2026Are you trying to jump s.h.i.+p?\u201dTang Min\u2019s wispy hair trembled. He looked bewildered. \u201cBoss, are you going to fire me?\u201dAfter saying this, he immediately turned to look at Yu Zhengdu. 'singer, if I\u2019m fired by the laboratory, can I go work with you?\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dJiao Shanlan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu glanced at Tang Min\u2019s hair and awkwardly rejected, \u201cSorry, our boss has a lot of requirements\u2026\u2026You might not be the best fit.\u201dTang Min refused to admit defeat. \u201cHow am I not the best fit. I have a good education and lots of experience. If you\u2019re worried that my salary is too high, for you, I can lower it a bit\u2026\u2026\u201dJiao Shanlan: \u201cKekeke!\u201d He was still right here!Yu Zhengdu couldn\u2019t avoid revealing the cruel truth. \u201cThe first requirement our boss has when hiring someone\u2026\u2026is that they need to have a lot of hair.\u201dTang Min: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dEveryone else: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dTang Min started wailing. He yelled, \u201cYour boss is too much! He\u2019s prejudiced against bald people, I\u2019m going to report him to the Labor Bureau!\u201dYu Zhengdu held his hands out in exasperation. \u201cGo ahead. He has no fears.\u201dOn the contrary, Zhao Ruola looked excited. \u201cYou guys have this requirement for hiring? Then isn\u2019t that my dream work environment? I feel that you are close to getting me\u2026\u2026\u201dBefore she could finish speaking, she heard a voice coldly ask, \u201cWho\u2019s going to get you?\u201dEveryone present looked over at the source of the voice and felt something flash in their field of vision. Even Yu Zhengdu couldn\u2019t help sucking in a breath. They watched Shang Que, dressed in a formal suit with a wine gla.s.s casually dangling between his fingers, slowly stroll over.Shang Que\u2019s normal countenance was already very shocking. After specially putting on a three-piece-tux today, he looked even more handsome, like a pine tree or a jade . He immediately became the center of everyone\u2019s attention.Zhao Ruola\u2019s tone suddenly changed. \u201cYou!\u201dShang Que: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu couldn\u2019t help side-eyeing her. \u201cMiss, keep calm.\u201dZhao Ruola lightly coughed. \u201cMy bad.\u201dYu Zhengdu introduced everyone to each other. \u201cThis is our company\u2019s CEO, Shang Que.\u201dTang Min\u2019s throat tightened. He barely got out, \u201cI can get a hair transplant!\u201dShang Que was bewildered. \u201c\u2026\u2026What does that have to do with me?\u201dZhao Ruola who had just had stars in her eyes suddenly became uninterested. She said, \u201cSo you\u2019re not a celebrity, Ey, what a pity.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dJiao Shanlan knew about Zhao Ruola\u2019s faults. He lowly explained, \u201cThe way she relaxes normally is by fangirling. For her, people in the field are only sources of stress.\u201dYu Zhengdu understood.Good-looking celebrities could be viewed as stress relief. But no matter how good-looking your boss was\u2026\u2026he was still your boss. It was hard to feel happy looking at your boss.Zhao Ruola shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m suddenly nervous. You guys keep chatting. I\u2019ll go to the bathroom.\u201dAs soon as Zhao Ruola left, Yu Zhengdu asked Shang Que in a whisper, \u201cHow come you\u2019re suddenly here?\u201dShang Que\u2019s expression looked like he was ready to fight against any injustices. \u201cI\u2019ve come to see if the pitiful laboratory has cried or not.\u201dHe glanced at Jiao Shanlan, then, in accordance with what he had just heard, spoke with a tone of faint understanding, \u201cI think he might be about to soon.\u201dYu Zhengdu was bewildered. He didn\u2019t understand the other\u2019s logic, but also didn\u2019t know how to ask about it. He could only switch topics. \u201cHow did you get in?\u201d The security today was tight as could be.Shang Que calmly stated, \u201cThrough the wall.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d I almost forgot again, Boss isn\u2019t a person.Next, Shang Que furrowed his brows and asked, \u201cWhat did you do? How come I heard two people talking behind your back when I walked in?\u201dYu Zhengdu thought about it. He wasn\u2019t surprised. \u201cProbably because I\u2019ve made them feel kind of uncomfortable.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Shang Que actually didn\u2019t care that much. He said, \u201cNo matter. Either way, I\u2019ve already made sure that they\u2019re even more uncomfortable.\u201dYu Zhengdu immediately became on high alert. \u201cWhat did you do to them?\u201dAs soon as he finished speaking, a woman\u2019s scream sounded out beside them. It immediately attracted everyone\u2019s attention. Yu Zhengdu turned his head over to look too, and discovered that the cause of the commotion was the two people who had been rebuked by him during the meeting.Shang Que glanced over as well. He said, \u201cIt was these two. They kept talking smack about you.\u201dShortly after, the people beside them started whispering, \u201cThose two don\u2019t even have their pants zipped up. Their underwear is showing. Aiya, how, you know\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu looked at Shang Que in shock. \u201cYou??!\u201d Boss used these methods to make people uncomfortable?!Shang Que: !!!!!!Shang Que almost spat out a mouthful of Underworld energy. He hurriedly waved his hands, \u201cI didn\u2019t!! It wasn\u2019t me!!\u201dBut Yu Zhengdu pieced together the two halves of the story and expressed his extreme suspicion in regards to Shang Que\u2019s denial.Shang Que angrily expressed, \u201cI only told that guilong to teach those two people a lesson. I didn\u2019t know that this ghost would be so unprincipled! No wonder it hides in the bathroom all day.\u201dIt turned out that while Shang Que was in the middle of pa.s.sing through the wall to enter the room, he coincidentally heard two people hiding in the corner and talking badly about Yu Zhengdu behind his back. Thus, he followed the two of them into the bathroom, preparing to beat them up. He hadn\u2019t expected for there to be a guilong hiding in this hotel\u2019s bathroom. As soon as it saw the Ghost King appear, it immediately started ingratiating itself to him, saying that it was willing to serve the Ghost King in any way.Guilongs were a type of ghost that inhabited bathrooms. There were many records of bathroom ghosts. For example, toilet ghosts, leiting, G.o.d of sushuang, etc. Among them, guilong was one of the most common. It was also called bei-a guilong. These ghosts typically weren\u2019t harmful, but they had a bad reputation because they enjoyed hiding in bathrooms and playing stinky jokes.Shang Que was in a rush to find Yu Zhengdu, so gave the task of \u201cteaching a lesson\u201d to the two men to the guilong. In Shang Que\u2019s understanding, teaching a lesson = beating up. But now, it seemed that the guilong had a different understanding.Yu Zhengdu immediately understood after hearing his explanation. \u201cHow indecent, no wonder they have a bad name!\u201dShang Que was p.i.s.sed too. It was fine that the guilong was unprincipled by itself, but he had almost caused Shang Que\u2019s reputation to suffer too.After cussing out the guilong, Yu Zhengdu suddenly thought about it and realized, \u201cEy, wait. Guilongs hide in the bathroom, so doesn\u2019t that mean they watch other people use the bathroom everyday?\u201dShang Que: \u201c Un , that\u2019s the only hobby guilongs have.\u201dYu Zhengdu rolled up his sleeves. \u201cWe can\u2019t have that. Voyeurs are voyeurs, we can\u2019t let him off easy just because he\u2019s a ghost.\u201dSince historical times, an abundance of strange and creepy ghosts existed. Shang Que didn\u2019t think anything of it, but since Yu Zhengdu wanted to go catch the voyeur, he naturally followed.As soon as the two of them reached the door of the bathroom, they saw Zhao Ruola walk out towing a small child. The child wore black clothing and had his head down; he was wearing a strange, large hat. As she walked, she scolded, \u201cYou\u2019re so young but are already peeping on women going to the bathroom. Don\u2019t think that just because I\u2019m pretty I won\u2019t hit a child\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que paused in his steps. He told Yu Zhengdu, \u201cThat\u2019s the guilong.\u201dGuilong: was the form of a small child, one and a half feet tall, with a black coat and large red headscarf, carrying a sword and halberd.Yu Zhengdu pointed at the guilong, then looked at Zhao Ruola strangely. \u201cErica, you can see this?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Upon hearing this, Zhao Ruola furrowed her brows, but quickly came to a realization. She tugged on the child\u2019s hat to make him lift his face and found that though this child was small, his face looked quite weathered with age.Zhao Ruola let go in disgust, then calmly said, \u201cYou mean I\u2019ve run into another ghost?\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201cAnother?\u201dZhao Ruola nodded and explained to him. It turned out that starting from a certain day several years ago, she suddenly discovered that something had gone wrong with her eyes. She would occasionally be able to see strange things. At first, she thought that she was hallucinating, but she saw a doctor who found nothing wrong. A long time later, she finally realized that she was able to see ghosts.This was the first time Yu Zhengdu was hearing about such a situation. He turned around to ask Shang Que in confusion, \u201cIs this considered a natural third eye?\u201d\u201cNo, third eyes mean you can see Underworld creatures from birth. Hers came on later in life.\u201d Shang Que observed Zhao Ruola\u2019s eyes for a moment, then said, \u201cShe has mostly likely opened her insight eye.\u201dYu Zhengdu didn\u2019t understand. \u201cInsight eye?\u201dShang Que nodded. The insight eye was one of the five types of eyes in Buddhism. It was also called the spirit eye. It could see the true form of things; very dedicated Buddhists could achieve it through years of penance.After hearing this, Zhao Ruola was perplexed. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never practiced Buddhism.\u201dShang Que\u2019s expression was conflicted. \u201cActually, regardless of if you are practicing Daoism or Buddhism, the core teaching of both is to erase all the disturbances from the outside world and forget yourself completely. I believe, you probably suddenly made a breakthrough during a single moment when you became hyper focused on your technological experiments. Then, you opened your insight eye.\u201dCultivation was based on the comprehension of spiritual roots and being able to remove impure thoughts from one\u2019s mind. Zhao Ruola was intelligent enough and had a strong enough mentality. From a certain perspective, she met these requirements.Yu Zhengdu snorted. \u201cYou can achieve it that way?\u201dBut Zhao Ruola immediately came to a realization. \u201cNo wonder. That time I happened to have several projects on my hands. They took a lot of energy. During that period, other than those projects, I didn\u2019t think of anything else. It was after that that I suddenly became able to see ghosts. But it happened on and off. I thought I was hallucinating from the pressure\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que said, \u201cThis type of insight eye isn\u2019t constant. Normally, it\u2019ll only appear when you\u2019re extremely focused.\u201dZhao Ruola nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly how it is. Just now it was because I got too into the discussion with singer\u2026\u2026\u201dShe stated dejectedly, \u201cBut aside from bringing me the trouble of seeing ghosts, this insight eye hasn\u2019t had any positive consequences!\u201dShang Que made a noise of acknowledgement. \u201cIf this were in the days of cultivation, being able to see the world how it truly was would be a worthy breakthrough. But for the normal humans of today\u2026\u2026it can only be considered a pretty useless skill.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201cStop talking\u2026\u2026cultivators are going to die from anger if you keep talking.\u201dSome people practiced for their entire lifetimes and weren\u2019t able to gain the insight eye. But she had accidentally made this breakthrough doing science\u2026\u2026and was even disdainful of it!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51 - An Important AdditionPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 51 - An Important AdditionAfter discussing Zhao Ruola\u2019s insight eye, the three of them finally looked at the guilong.The guilong was like a quail, standing off to the side, head low. He didn\u2019t dare to run away. Upon seeing them look over, he was so scared his knees quaked and he almost knelt. He said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t peeping, I really wasn\u2019t!\u201dZhao Ruola: \u201cYou pa.s.sed under my dress!\u201dThe guilong\u2019s expression was extremely sorrowful. \u201cThat was because I\u2019ve been a ghost for such a long time that I\u2019ve gotten used to not looking at people when I walk. I pa.s.sed under you because I\u2019m short\u2026\u2026\u201dZhao Ruola: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu noticed that the guilong was both sniffling and crying; it didn\u2019t look like he was lying. Thus, he asked, \u201cIf you weren\u2019t trying to peep, why did you go to the women\u2019s restroom?\u201dThe guilong paused for a moment. A while later, he finally hesitantly spoke, \u201cI was looking for my good friend, Bei.\u201dYu Zhengdu was confused. \u201cBei?\u201dShang Que explained, \u201cAnother type of ghost that lives in the bathroom.\u201dThis type of ghost also spent most of their time in bathrooms. But unlike other bathroom ghosts that liked playing jokes, they had very pitiful and cowardly personalities. Most were female. If you accidentally ran into one, as long as you said a few disdainful phrases towards her, you would be able to scare her away. Thus, they were called \u201cbei\u201d.Yu Zhengdu spoke with sudden respect, \u201c\u2026\u2026Who knew that in such a tiny bathroom, there would be so many ghosts.\u201dActually, this was normal, though. Bathrooms were often avoided by humans, but honestly, if one was a human, one would have to visit the bathroom. Other than the removal of waste, it also contained the ways of society and hid the deepest, darkest, innermost thoughts of people. Thus, with enough time, bathrooms birthed all sorts of demons and ghosts.As they spoke, they suddenly heard the guilong b.u.t.t in, \u201cBei, you\u2019ve come out.\u201dThey followed Guilong\u2019s gaze and looked over, only to see a small girl with loose, long hair peeking out from the door of the women\u2019s bathroom. The girl looked at them in panic. Finally, her eyes fell onto the guilong and she scratched the wall with her fingers. She carefully spoke, \u201cWhat are you, you guys doing?\u201dThe guilong said with a bitter expression, \u201cThey thought I was watching other people use the bathroom. Hurry and help me explain.\u201dBei picked at the wall and softly said, \u201cHe didn\u2019t.\u201dYu Zhengdu remembered that these ghosts felt very inferior, so was worried about scaring her. He thought a while before speaking, \u201cCome over here. If you explain clearly, things will be okay.\u201dOnly to see Bei stare at him for a while then suddenly flush red. She held onto her head and screamed, \u201cAh\u2014\u2014\u201d, then yelled loudly, \u201cI won\u2019t\u2014\u2014\u201d. She curled in on herself and simply disappeared.Yu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu looked at Guilong, bewildered. \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything that would insult her just now, right? Why did she\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d Guilong looked at him with a conflicted expression. \u201cBut you\u2019re too good-looking. Just looking at you has made her feel inferior\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que scanned him with his peripheral vision. He said, \u201cYour appearance truly could affect a bei\u2019s mood.\u201dYu Zhengdu glared back at him, unimpressed. \u201cLook in the mirror first, then speak. Are you qualified to be lecturing me?\u201dBeside them, Zhao Ruola expressed with great difficulty, \u201c\u2026\u2026These two misters, can you not praise each other in front of a lady?\u201dAnd you were using such a strange tone of voice\u2026\u2026They interrogated the guilong a bit more before confirming that he truly didn\u2019t have the bad habit of voyeurism. He only liked to hide in the men\u2019s bathroom and occasionally visited the women\u2019s bathroom. Since he wasn\u2019t actually doing anything harmful to society, he didn\u2019t meet the requirements for being arrested in the Underworld. Thus, Yu Zhengdu only warned him before letting him go free.After resolving the issue with the guilong, Zhao Ruola turned to look at the two of them. She very meaningfully asked, \u201cYou seem to be very familiar with dealing with ghosts?\u201dYu Zhengdu responded in the same tone, \u201cYou too, seem to be unafraid of ghosts whatsoever.\u201dZhao Ruola very humbly said, \u201cAt first I was scared, but later on I gave up and thought, at worst I\u2019m going to die. After I die, I\u2019ll be a ghost too. By then, who will be scared of who?\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d As expected, the logic of the female technician with the capability of opening the insight eye is strong enough to overcome ghosts.He very calmly handed her Luofeng\u2019s business card and stated, \u201cTake a better look at our services offered. Use your heart to understand it.\u201dZhao Ruola: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dZhao Ruola slowly put the business card away. \u201cRight now, I very sincerely hope that I can go visit your company to get to know it better.\u201d***Technology Today: #starflicker\u2019s Three Big Cheeses Reveal True Ident.i.ties# The technology summit that all eyes were on began on time today at Ancient Well Hotel. Discussions covered cloud technology, smart cities, web safety, and other hot topics. During the meeting, Jiao Shanlan and Zhao Ruola revealed their online ident.i.ties on the starflicker forum. They are the famous users lan and osone, respectively. At the same time, another forum big V that many are interested in, singer, was present too [link].Journal of An Old Internet Friend: #starflicker\u2019s Three Big Cheeses Reveal True Ident.i.ties# Today, the entire field of Internet technology had a wild celebration. Technology experts singer, osone, and lan simultaneously revealed their true ident.i.ties at the technology summit. osone and lan are Zhao Ruola and Jiao Shanlan respectively. Previously, singer also received an invitation to join Jiao Shanlan\u2019s laboratory. According to a reliable source, this reveal has caused starflicker to gain its largest influx of users since its formation. Venture capitalists have already gotten in contact with the website, seeking to invest in it.Hidden Values: This year\u2019s Fu City Technology Summit had lots of interesting points. Aside from the white paper published by several technology experts, there were also talks given by Zhao Ruola, Jiao Shanlan, Wei Xiao, etc., bringing exciting conversations into light. Additionally, the big V of a certain forum, singer, revealed his true ident.i.ty and got on stage to give an impromptu speech. He shared with everyone the operationalization results from the battle posts about metaphysics and technology that were very popular a while ago. According to reporters, his presentation received much praise. singer himself has also become one of the most antic.i.p.ated future stars of the field.This is a Bit Too Funny: #starflicker\u2019s Three Big Cheeses Reveal True Ident.i.ties# This might be the cruellest consecutive face-slapping scene in history\u2026\u2026[long image]Though the technology summits of previous years had garnered a lot of attention too, this attention was mainly limited to those inside the technology field. But because of this year\u2019s three big cheeses revealing their ident.i.ties incident, the event gained a much more dramatic spin. Aside from big V technology accounts, several entertainment and marketing accounts also reposted it. This, on top of Yu Zhengdu\u2019s topic that seemed both scientific and unscientific, made everyone extremely confused. They all reposted to show their respect.Thus, before this year\u2019s technology summit ended, several topics regarding it had already ended up on the trending list. Yu Zhengdu became famous in an instant. Not only was he hailed as the brightest future star of the technological field, he also gained quite a following among the general population.The most fascinating part was\u2026\u2026his situation was the same as when Shang Que had gotten onto the trending list. Though he got onto the list based on his prowess, he garnered fans because of his face.\u3010I was attracted by the revealing of true ident.i.ties\u2026\u2026then got mesmerized by singer\u2019s face\u3011\u3010Wait, this little brother is a technology expert???? Why is he so handsome? And not bald?\u3011\u3010\u2026\u2026The one in the top comments who mentioned balding, are you a demon ?\u3011There were also attentive netizens who found the crucial point:\u3010Wait, isn\u2019t this CEO\u2019s CP, senior?\u3011\u3010So not only is Amazing Future\u2019s boss handsome? Even their programmers are handsome too?\u3011Following the exposure of the company Yu Zhengdu was working at, Amazing Future once again caught the attention of netizens. Overnight, their company\u2019s official Weibo account gained an impressive number of fans. Even their product sales increased too.At the same time, as Yu Zhengdu\u2019s CP, From Today On I Will Be A European G.o.d once again attracted a new group of fans\u2026\u2026CP fans.But in comparison to normal netizens who only cared about the revealing of ident.i.ties at the summit and singer\u2019s face, the technological field was more interested in singer himself and the company he worked at.Even though the products and services listed on Amazing Future\u2019s official website still seemed very untrustworthy, the information Yu Zhengdu had shared during the summit was enough to make those in the field change their opinions.There were several large factories and investment companies that even started contacting Yu Zhengdu after the meeting. They asked him if he was interested in jumping s.h.i.+p.To those in the field, Yu Zhengdu was clearly a bright pearl covered in dust. With his skills, he would definitely be able to achieve much more glorious results, given he switched companies and projects. But sadly, no matter how amazing the conditions outsiders offered were, Yu Zhengdu remained unmoved.Those in the field were extremely confused, but there were several who surmised from Yu Zhengdu\u2019s speech at the discussion that a company capable of providing such a large database must have an unexpected project they were working on.However, the most ridiculous were those people who really dared to think. According to the CP comments online, they suspected that Yu Zhengdu had simply been blinded by love?Regardless, though, as Yu Zhengdu politely rejected all his invitations and Luofeng refused to respond to all the guesses made about them, maintaining their att.i.tude of being outside of the rest of the world, everyone started losing interest in this company.Until half a month later, when a news update appeared out of the blue and once again shocked the entire Internet field.Zhao Ruola, who had already been back in the country for quite a bit of time but still hadn\u2019t publicly announced her intentions, suddenly used her personal account to share her final decision: To officially join Luofeng\u2019s subsidiary company, Amazing Future, as their vice president and technical director. She would be on the same level as CTO Yu Zhengdu.Almost the entire field\u2019s first response after seeing her update was to check if this account was a high-quality fake.But there were some very impressive reporters who managed to quickly get in contact with Zhao Ruola personally. They also confirmed that she truly was joining Amazing Future and was actually going to start work the next week.As for what project this company was working on and what conditions they had offered her, she refused to answer. She only left a mysterious, \u201cEveryone will know in the future.\u201dWith this, the entire field fell into confusion. Who would\u2019ve thought that not only had everyone failed to steal Yu Zhengdu from this company, another top-tier figure, Zhao Ruola, had also decided to join them instead.Zhao Ruola even agreed to be on the same level as Yu Zhengdu, who had only just joined the ranks of society? Even though he was singer, he was still just a twenty-something year old singer.Ultimately what mysterious power did this company have?Because of Zhao Ruola\u2019s important addition, several venture capitalists who had previously only been observing the situation acted without abandon and instantly held out olive branches to Amazing Future. They expressed that they wanted to invest, but were all immediately rejected.As such, the capital market became even more confused. In a time where every startup treated venture capitalists as the G.o.ds of fortune, how could this company be so stubborn?What they didn\u2019t know was, after rejecting their intentions to invest, Yu Zhengdu hung up the phone and cried silently in his heart\u2026\u2026It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t want to, but that he couldn\u2019t ah. This was h.e.l.l. Boss needed to maintain absolute control over everything. Their stocks couldn\u2019t be shared with any investment companies.Thus, even if broke-a.s.s Boss had to save money instead of spending on his games, he could only bite the bullet and keep working hard to earn money.But it wasn\u2019t that there were no upsides. Because of both singer and Zhao Ruola\u2019s fame, along with these venture capitalists\u2019 interest, Luofeng and Amazing Future garnered a lot of attention. Afterwards, when the company started hiring once more, things became much easier, especially in regards to technicians. There were even fans of the two who offered to lower their salaries to join. Here, we won\u2019t say any more.Yu Zhengdu\u2019s university cla.s.s group chat had a heated discussion about this too:Cla.s.smate A:\u3010Zhengdu and Zhao Ruola are on the same level\u2026\u2026Zhao Ruola\u2026\u2026Same level\u3011Cla.s.smate B:\u3010He\u2019s singer, singer ah !!!\u3011Zhu Yan:\u3010Zhengdu, in the future, will you still be willing to be friends with me?\u3011Cla.s.smate B:\u3010Back then, when Zhengdu rejected landry\u2019s offer to join the company he\u2019s at now, I even thought\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026But now, it seems that I am too young !\u3011Zhang Qingqing:\u3010I never thought that way. You guys don\u2019t know what our Big Boss\u2019s att.i.tude is towards him!!! Previously, lots of coworkers secretly said that Big Boss got bewitched\u2026\u2026\u3011Zhang Qingqing:\u3010But now they\u2019ve all shut up. Zhengdu and Zhao Ruola are already on the same level. Basically, he\u2019s now on the same level as our Big Boss\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010I have nothing to say. How about I give everyone a red envelope\u3011***No matter how heated the discussion was outside, it was only temporary. As Luofeng rejected all inquiries and interviews, sponsors and the media naturally started looking for other hot topics.But for the employees of Luofeng and Amazing Future, a new phase was only just beginning.With Zhao Ruola\u2019s prowess, as long as she joined Luofeng, she would definitely take up one of the core positions. Thus, Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que didn\u2019t hide anything from her. In actuality, the only thing that had attracted her enough to join Luofeng was the Life and Death Accounts system.Thus, after Yu Zhengdu and Zheng Yan, Zhao Ruola became the third living employee of Luofeng. But, her t.i.tle was under Amazing Future\u2019s name. She was the same standing as Yu Zhengdu and was mainly responsible for the design and management of the Life and Death Accounts mobile app.Zhao Ruola\u2019s arrival gave Amazing Future\u2019s technology department a great boost of faith. It also made Yu Zhengdu\u2019s work much easier.But in comparison, it gave Shang Que an enormous amount of pressure.Mainly because with her experience and skill\u2026\u2026her salary was way too high.It was a good thing that Zhao Ruola wasn\u2019t working here for the money. She expressed that she could take temporary IOU\u2019s for wages. Yet, after much painful pondering, Shang Que still\u2026\u2026posted two selfies that day on his personal Weibo account to stimulate sales.\u2026\u2026Better than nothing.But now, his fans were of a much more complex composition than before. After he posted the selfies, quite a lot of people commented:\u3010CEO post your boyfriend\u2019s picture too\u3011From Today On I Will Be A European G.o.d: NoAnd then the comments went:\u3010??????????\u3011\u3010Wait, CEO only said he wouldn\u2019t post a picture, but he didn\u2019t deny that he was his boyfriend?\u3011\u3010CEO and senior are real!!!\u3011\u2026\u2026Because she had heard that a pretty older sister had arrived at the Luofeng headquarters, the little belly spirit, Peppa, who had been out having a lot of fun, specially came back to visit. She wanted to see Zhao Ruola.Yet, after only a short time back, she excitedly came to find Yu Zhengdu. \u201cGege, gege, I just made a new friend.\u201dHer new friend obviously wouldn\u2019t be a normal human. Yu Zhengdu was slightly nervous inside, but didn\u2019t show it on his face. He smiled and asked Peppa, \u201cOh, where did you make your new friend? Take me to see?\u201dPeppa nodded and tugged him outside. \u201cIn the bathroom.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d How come there were now ghosts in the bathrooms of the technology park too?He followed Peppa to the bathroom and heard Peppa shout, \u201cGuilong, my gege wants to see you. Come out.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026???\u201dOnly to see a short person with a black coat and large hat, carrying a sword, stick his head out and smile at Yu Zhengdu. \u201ch.e.l.lo, long time no see.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026How come you\u2019re here? The Ancient Well Hotel\u2019s bathrooms aren\u2019t enough for you to inhabit?\u201dThe guilong said very innocently, \u201cI wasn\u2019t the one that wanted to come. Bei did.\u201dYu Zhengdu was bewildered, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d\u201cI know!\u201d Peppa raised her hand, \u201cBei jiejie said gege is good looking. She wants to be able to see gege every day.\u201dThe corner of Yu Zhengdu\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201c\u2026\u2026Where\u2019s Bei?\u201dGuilong said, \u201cShe just took a glance at you from afar and has now hidden herself out of inferiority.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe author has something to say:Zhao Ruola smiling mysteriously, \u201cEveryone will know in the future!\u201dPeppa and Bei are recording off to the side.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52 - Ghost Festival Garden PartyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 52 - Ghost Festival Garden PartyDue to the popularity brought in by the technology summit, Amazing Future\u2019s product sales reached a new high. Aside from the sales contributed by netizens and fans, the main increase was unexpectedly brought in by high level administrators in the technological field. Especially the social circle that Jiao Shanlan and Zhao Ruola belonged to. Everyone was very curious about the company that was home to singer, someone Jiao Shanlan praised a lot, and had also attracted Zhao Ruola. They wanted to see what was so special about it.And these people were generally quite well off. When they bought things, they didn\u2019t bother with the price. Many had simply bought entire sets for themselves.As they noted the steadily increasing revenue, all of Luofeng\u2019s employees felt great joy, to the point that the current atmosphere was quite merry. Only Shang Que, who had made incredible advancements in his MBA cla.s.s and gained a considerable knowledge of finance, couldn\u2019t act fully ecstatic.Their company was earning more, but in comparison, they were spending more and more too. Especially since Zhao Ruola\u2019s addition. Without mentioning her shocking salary and only speaking of the developmental fees she calculated to be necessary, Shang Que\u2019s n.o.ble Ghost King Heart felt heavy. He couldn\u2019t peacefully be a ghost anymore.Most importantly, Shang Que could now tell that Zhao Ruola\u2019s calculations were right.Their entire setup was designed to last for a long time. Thus, it couldn\u2019t be half-a.s.sed in the slightest. In fact, it even had to be better than what large factories could produce. This determined that their development fee couldn\u2019t possibly be lowered.In this gloomy atmosphere hidden under a joyful one, they reached the seventh month of the lunar year. Then, Luofeng\u2019s three living employees discovered that seemingly overnight, their originally cheerful ghostly coworkers had become depressed.Yu Zhengdu had worked at Luofeng for a while. He had a pretty good relations.h.i.+p with his ghostly coworkers. Upon witnessing this, he secretly asked Kang Jin about the situation.Kang Jin was sighing too. He looked around to confirm that Shang Que wasn\u2019t anywhere nearby, then casually tugged his wig off. He used it to fan himself while explaining to Yu Zhengdu, \u201cIsn\u2019t the Zhongyuan Festival coming up\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu expressionlessly stole his wig from him and put it back on his head. \u201cThat isn\u2019t a good enough reason for you to harm my eyes.\u201dCoincidentally, Zhao Ruola was pa.s.sing by. Upon seeing this, she became extremely surprised. She looked like she had been lied to. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that there aren\u2019t any bald people in our company?\u201dYu Zhengdu calmly replied, \u201cHe\u2019s not a person.\u201dZhao Ruola: \u201c\u2026\u2026You\u2019re absolutely right.\u201dKang Jin nervously made a gesture. \u201cSpeak softer. Boss warned me that I can never let him catch me without my wig on.\u201dZhao Ruola nodded and walked away quickly with her eyes covered. \u201cIt\u2019d be best that you never let me see that again either.\u201dKang Jin sorrowfully straightened his wig. He asked Yu Zhengdu, \u201cWhen can we develop the technology for Underworld hair regrowth\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu ignored him. He asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the Zhongyuan Festival?\u201dThe Zhongyuan Festival, also known as Diguan Festival, s.h.i.+gu Festival, and \u201cBon Festival\u201d in Buddhism. But among the common folk, it had a more popular name\u2014\u2014Ghost Festival.According to legend, this day was the day the earth official forgave sinners. The Underworld would open the gates of h.e.l.l and spirits could leave. This was known as the parade of a hundred ghosts. Those that still had living relatives could return home to reunite with them, whereas those left alone could wander the mortal realm.No matter from which perspective, this day was one that deserved to be celebrated by ghosts. It shouldn\u2019t make his coworkers so dejected.Kang Jin slapped his thigh and complained, \u201cI won\u2019t talk about the historic ghosts. I\u2019m just going to talk about us good, socialist ghosts. Normally, we follow the laws of the Underworld and don\u2019t dare to loiter in the mortal realm. We finally have a festival where we can normally walk about the mortal realm, but look at the mortals\u2019 att.i.tudes. They avoid us like we\u2019re ghosts\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu couldn\u2019t help refuting, \u201cBut they truly are avoiding ghosts\u2026\u2026\u201dKang Jin paused for a moment. He slowly corrected, \u201cLike we\u2019re vengeful and evil ghosts. For us good, lawful ghosts, this is too unfriendly.\u201d\u201cWe only have this one day in the whole year to openly walk on the streets. We just want to experience the joys of life again, but during the Ghost Festival, shops close early and people head home early. By nighttime, the only ones wandering the streets are us ghosts. There\u2019s no difference from being in the Underworld\u2026\u2026\u201dThe more he spoke, the more wronged Kang Jin felt. He felt the sorrow from being discriminated against by the mortal realm.But Yu Zhengdu finally understood what he was trying to say. This was the difference in thinking that resulted from the lack of communication between the mortal realm and Underworld.Underworld spirits had once been living humans in the mortal realm. They still thought fondly of the mortal realm, especially those with relatives who were alive. To put it simply, they were somewhat homesick. Consequently, during holidays, especially large holidays in the Underworld, they naturally wished to return to their homes and reunite with their \u201cfamily members\u201d. They wanted to remember what it felt like to be alive.But for those mortals with no memories of their previous lives, the Underworld symbolized death, creepiness, and demons and monsters. This, in addition to their cultural understanding, caused living humans to be filled with a natural fear for this separate realm. As a result, on the day of the Ghost Festival, in order to avoid running into ghosts, everyone was in the habit of returning home early. And, since there were less and less people who held large-scale sacrifices, especially in large cities like Fu City, several young people didn\u2019t actually know that the Ghost Festival had traditions.Slowly, the Ghost Festival became the most unfestive festival in the mortal realm.Yu Zhengdu could understand this, though. After all, before joining Luofeng, he was also one of those young people who refused to stay outside during the Ghost Festival\u2026\u2026He comforted Kang Jin, \u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to be so sad. It\u2019s not that humans are purposefully discriminating against you guys. It\u2019s just that the two realms rarely communicate, so they don\u2019t understand you. Your image with the general public isn\u2019t that great, either, so some fear is understandable\u2026\u2026\u201dKang Jin also knew that this wasn\u2019t the fault of mortals. He could only switch to scolding those evil ghosts who often disrupted society\u2019s normal functions. \u201cIf not for them, our image wouldn\u2019t be so terrible in the mortal realm!\u201dYu Zhengdu felt the same way he did. He scolded those evil ghosts with Kang Jin. Afterwards, Kang Jin felt a bit better, but this didn\u2019t solve the root of the problem. The entire office and even the entire Underworld couldn\u2019t be cured from its depressed mood.At night, at the end of the work day, Yu Zhengdu was still thinking about this. Coincidentally, Shang Que walked over to look for him, holding hands with Peppa. He said, \u201cIt\u2019ll be the Zhongyuan Festival in a few days. We should go together to buy some new outfits for Peppa.\u201dPeppa spun in circles happily, \u201cTime to go shopping.\u201dAs soon as he saw her, Yu Zhengdu\u2019s eyes curved into crescents and he grabbed her other hand to hold. \u201cOkay, we can buy a few extra sets this time.\u201dSince Zhao Ruola had joined Luofeng, the resolving of the Life and Death Accounts\u2019 remaining problems became evidently faster. If they kept this speed up, they would be able to calculate Peppa\u2019s reincarnation results quite soon.As soon as he remembered that her next life would most likely be some small animal, Yu Zhengdu felt that he needed to utilize their time together now and buy her more little dresses.But after hearing his words, Peppa didn\u2019t appear overjoyed. Instead, she tugged on his fingers and leaned her neck back to ask, \u201cGege, I only need one dress. Can you give the rest to my friend Georgie?\u201dYu Zhengdu snorted with laughter. \u201cYou\u2019re friend\u2019s name is Georgie?\u201dPeppa nodded. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have a name, so I gave him this one.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe had been extremely busy previously, so hadn\u2019t had a good talk with Peppa in a long time. Upon seeing that she had made quite a few new friends and was willing to share her things with them, he felt very touched in his heart. Thus, he squatted and asked, \u201cWhy do you want to give them to Georgie?\u201dPeppa said, \u201cHe\u2019s an orphan, so n.o.body burns clothes for him. He admires the fact that I have clothes to wear very much, so I thought\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu nodded. \u201cNo problem. Then we\u2019ll buy extra. You can have a few more dresses and Georgie can have clothes too.\u201dPeppa clapped happily, \u201cYay.\u201dThese days, Peppa was no longer a little girl who had only watched Peppa Pig, but a little girl who had watched all major cartoons. The clothes she chose were in the most popular styles. After she picked out what she wanted, Yu Zhengdu paid and had the paper shop burn it on the spot.While waiting for the paper to burn, Peppa couldn\u2019t hold back her excitement. She tugged on Yu Zhengdu and shared her holiday plans. \u201cGege, Georgie, me, and our other friends already made plans. On the day of the Zhongyuan Festival, we\u2019re going to go play together in the amus.e.m.e.nt park\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter saying this, she added a little dejectedly, \u201cBut Georgie said, during the Zhongyuan Festival, amus.e.m.e.nt parks will close very early. We can only play until nine.\u201dNine. For Underworld spirits, this was only the start of the day\u2026\u2026Yu Zhengdu had also been worrying about this problem today. Upon hearing this, he looked at Shang Que. \u201cIs there anything scheduled in the Underworld for the Zhongyuan Festival? It\u2019s such a big holiday. If there aren\u2019t any celebrations, it might very easily lead to societal dysfunct.\u201dShang Que shook his head and shared in exasperation, \u201cSince ancient times, the celebrations in the Underworld have all been reflections of the festivities in the mortal realm. Right now, the Ghost Festival doesn\u2019t have a good name in the mortal realm, so there aren\u2019t that many festivities. I can\u2019t do anything about it.\u201dYu Zhengdu watched as Peppa excitedly tried on a pumpkin costume. He suddenly had an idea. He said, \u201cHow about, we prepare a celebration ourselves?\u201dShang Que turned to look at him. His gaze looked somewhat confused.Yu Zhengdu pointed at Peppa\u2019s outfit and very seriously stated, \u201cI just remembered. Isn\u2019t the foreign holiday of Halloween quite similar to the Ghost Festival? But Halloween is always very festive. Not only are people not scared, they also partic.i.p.ate in it more and more. Why do we only link the Ghost Festival to creepy and horrifying things?\u201dShang Que pondered a bit and realized that what he was saying made sense. But, he still said, \u201cI think that people will find it very hard to treat the Ghost Festival like Halloween.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s okay too. The most important thing is to make our friends in the Underworld feel the holiday atmosphere. It helps in maintaining a good and kind society.\u201d Yu Zhengdu already had several plans in mind. He grinned and looked at Shang Que, \u201cLet\u2019s make Luofeng\u2019s own garden party.\u201dShang Que gazed into his sparkling eyes and slightly smiled too. \u201cOkay.\u201dYu Zhengdu pulled out his phone and started searching. \u201cLet me see if there\u2019s anything interesting\u2026\u2026\u201dBut Shang Que suddenly asked, \u201cDo you want to see the Underworld from a thousand years ago?\u201dTime pa.s.sed by quickly. In the blink of an eye, it was the day before the Zhongyuan Festival.That night, the normally desolate plaza around the corner from the technology park in Fu City\u2019s developmental district became unprecedentedly busy.The developmental district had once housed Fu City\u2019s suburbs. Its surroundings were a mix of urban and rural. It had only started becoming more organized after recent policies began focusing on it. But in comparison to the older, more central districts, it was still very deserted. The technology park was technically the most densely populated area in the developmental district. Besides it was Main Street. The houses along both sides of Main Street had been demolished, but the new buildings were still under construction, so aside from a few office buildings and a shopping center, this was an empty lot.Because it wasn\u2019t completely developed yet, normally, as soon as it hit the end of the work day, there were very few people around. It became unnaturally desolate.But this afternoon, things were out of the ordinary. Several people who worked nearby didn\u2019t head home after work. Instead, they got attracted to this location and whispered to each other, exclaiming in surprise.\u201cWhen did they build this? It wasn\u2019t here yesterday when I walked past in the afternoon?\u201d\u201cI saw it when I pa.s.sed by in the morning, but I was in a rush to get to work so didn\u2019t take too close of a look. What is this?\u201d\u201cSo they used all of last night to build it. That\u2019s too amazing.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s nothing. These days, as long you have money, you can even get someone to build a skysc.r.a.per for you overnight. Haven\u2019t you heard of a speed known as \u2018socialist speed\u2019?\u201d\u201cMy relative works in the shopping center and told me that it\u2019s a garden party that a company in the technology park is holding for the Ghost Festival. They rented the plaza in front of the shopping center and are also using some of the nearby empty lots.\u201d\u201cWhat? Ghost Festival garden party? Aren\u2019t they scared of running into ghosts?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t know if they\u2019re scared of running into ghosts or not, but the setup for their garden party is too amazing. I\u2019ve been to lots of amus.e.m.e.nt parks before and honestly, many professional amus.e.m.e.nt parks can\u2019t even reach their level!\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that so. Not only is their setup amazing, it\u2019s extremely unique too. What scenes are these? I\u2019ve never even seen anything like them\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re labelled. Let me see, Rubbish Money Mountain, Bridge Over Troubled Water, Home Viewing Terrace\u2026\u2026Ey, how come they all sound like places from down below?\u201d\u201cThen it really was specially built in the theme of the Ghost Festival? That\u2019s too interesting.\u201dOnly to see that the plaza in front of the shopping center, along with the areas around it, had transformed into a snaking exhibition of historic buildings overnight. Pavilions and terraces, street markets and restaurants, extremely accurate and detailed, dotted the lot. Even from far away, its unique, realistic feeling was obvious.Outside of the street market, there were several scenes that caught people\u2019s attention because they had never seen them before. Magnificent balconies, long and wide arched bridges, mountains created from paper replicas of gold and silver\u2026\u2026Someone in the crowd immediately couldn\u2019t hold themselves back. They tugged on their friend\u2019s arm and said, \u201cHow about we go inside and check it out?\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s the Ghost Festival. Shouldn\u2019t we head home earlier?\u201d\u201cWhat are you scared of? Don\u2019t you see all the people inside? It\u2019s so crowded, even if there were ghosts, they wouldn\u2019t dare to come out\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOkay then.\u201dThis was apparently a garden party organized by a certain company but that was open to the public. Aside from their own employees, all pa.s.sersby could enter and exit as they wished. Because of this, several people who were originally attracted by the architecture couldn\u2019t help but walk in to look around.\u201cThis garden party seems to have different themes in different areas. Let\u2019s check this one out first.\u201d Someone walked in and glanced around, only to see an enormous sign near the front door. On it were two words written in wild handwriting: ghost market.\u201cGhost market? Do they sell things there?\u201d The person with him couldn\u2019t hide the excitement in his tone. He directly dragged him inside.When they walked in, the visitors\u2019 eyes widened and the air became filled with shouts of surprise.The scene of the ghost market seemed to be an exact replica of the bustling markets of historic times. On its two sides were a building to listen to music in and a liquor store. There were several vendors with little carts on the street. But the difference presented itself in the white lanterns hanging from every corner of the street. The people looking out from the liquor store and the street vendors didn\u2019t look like normal people either. Several of them had dangling tongues, dug out eyes, fangs, and blood all over. This was all stage makeup to imitate ghosts and made the noisy market that much stranger and creepier. However, the visitors that filled the street and their loud voices mediated this bone-chilling feeling.Surprisingly, this caused an uncontrollable urge to take a chance to emerge in people\u2019s hearts.The street was filled with the occasional surprised shouts of visitors:\u201cWow, this person\u2019s head is about to fall off!\u201d\u201cThis makeup is a little bada.s.s.\u201d\u201cWait, I\u2019m going to take a picture to make it into a meme\u2014\u2014your head really fell off.\u201dThe person taking the picture didn\u2019t only speak; he also walked forward and held up the vendor\u2019s head a bit. He said, \u201cBig bro, can you hold onto your head? This way the picture will turn out better.\u201dThe big bro whose head got held up: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt was rare that they could hang out with living people during the Ghost Festival. He held back the embarra.s.sment and held onto his wobbling head with both hands. \u201cYou can take the picture now.\u201dSomeone else scooted in closer from the side and said, \u201cI can use my own intestines to strangle my neck. Do you want to take a picture?\u201dThe tourists hurriedly shook their hands. \u201cWe\u2019ll get blocked if we use memes like that.\u201dThat person could only sorrowfully mutter, \u201cHow come everyone likes to look for heads all over the floor, but no one likes to look for intestines all over the floor\u2026\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53 - Ghost MarketPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 53 - Ghost MarketIn order to better celebrate the Ghost Festival garden party, Luofeng and Amazing Future specially let everyone off work two hours in advance on this day. At 4 PM, all the people in the office instantly disappeared. They were headed straight to the garden party.Because Yu Zhengdu still had work to do regarding the system, he stayed an extra hour. When he finally finished what he needed to, he immediately called Peppa. \u201cPeppa, where are you? Gege will take you to the garden party.\u201dOnly to hear Peppa answer heartlessly from the other end, \u201cGege, Georgie, me, and the guilong and them have already made plans to play together. You don\u2019t need to come find me anymore.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe suddenly understood the pain of old fathers in regards to \u201c being unable to keep daughters around when they got older \u201d. Even though Peppa was only five years old\u2026\u2026\u201cAlright,\u201d Yu Zhengdu acknowledged. He warned, \u201cThen make sure to stay safe. Don\u2019t randomly hurt pa.s.sersby. If you run into bad people, you definitely need to tell your geges. Do not, under any circ.u.mstances, deal with them yourself\u2026\u2026\u201dPeppa obediently listened to him finish speaking, then crisply responded, \u201cI know, gege. I will be a good child, I won\u2019t randomly kill anyone\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu sweatdropped, only to hear the creepy voice of a young boy sound from the other end of the line. \u201cDon\u2019t worry gege. We know that if we kill people, we won\u2019t be able to turn into little pigs and will have to turn into mice\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201cYou are?\u201dThe little boy: \u201cI\u2019m Georgie.\u201dYu Zhengdu wiped his forehead. \u201c\u2026\u2026Okay, Georgie. Then be good and have fun.\u201dYu Zhengdu hung up, still sweating. He glanced around the empty office and suddenly felt a sensation of loneliness. He thought to himself, \u2026\u2026Possibly because he had gotten used to working shoulder to shoulder with Shang Que, at this moment, Yu Zhengdu instinctively thought of the other. , Yu Zhengdu pondered. He opened WeChat and sent Shang Que a voice call request.\u201c Deng deng deng deng deng deng \u2014\u2014\u201dThe familiar ringing sounded from behind him. Yu Zhengdu felt slightly surprised as he turned his head to look, only to see that Shang Que had appeared at an unknown time and was sitting in a chair nearby. His legs were crossed and one of his hands was elegantly holding up his chin. The other was scrolling through his phone. When he saw his WeChat light up, he reflexively looked up and coincidentally made eye contact with Yu Zhengdu.Shang Que\u2019s eyes were very deep, like bottomless pools of icy water. But his pupils were completely dark. There was no light in them at all; they reflected nothing.But in this moment, Yu Zhengdu felt that he could see his own reflection in them.Yu Zhengdu burst into unexpected laughter. He put his phone back into his pocket and crinkled his eyes to ask, \u201cWaiting for me?\u201dShang Que nodded and stood up. He didn\u2019t even need to ask. He only smiled and tilted his head to gesture that they should leave. \u201cLet\u2019s go. We can go to the garden party.\u201dThe garden party was much more crowded than Yu Zhengdu had expected. Originally, he thought that there would only be a limited number of event-goers since this was an unpopular festival held in a remote location with minimal promotion.But the beautiful, intricate, grand, and unique design had attracted practically everyone who worked nearby. Several people couldn\u2019t help immediately sharing what they were seeing on their WeChats and summoning their friends to come too. This caused a new influx of people to arrive.When Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que got to the garden party, people were already squeezed shoulder to shoulder. The noise was deafening.The seventh month of the year. Underworld energy was at its strongest; the border between the two realms was at its weakest. The Ghost King of Luofeng Mountain cast an enchantment so that anyone who stepped on this piece of land, whether living or dead, would be able to see both worlds.Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que first strolled through the ghost market. The whole way, they could see tourists bargaining with ghosts of different shapes and sizes, completely unafraid.\u201cThis little porcelain jar is quite intricate.\u201d A female white collar worker held up a white porcelain jar the size of her palm. She asked, \u201cWhat is it for?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a cinerary urn,\u201d the vendor answered while he molded some clay. \u201cIt\u2019s a replica of my own cinerary urn. Blue-and-white porcelain: it\u2019s lowkey but luxurious. You deserve to own one.\u201dWhite collar: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWow, this head is so big.\u201d Two little girls held up their phones to take a picture of one of the vendors on the side of the street.Yu Zhengdu looked over upon hearing this. The vendor\u2019s head truly was big. It was at least three times the size of a normal person\u2019s head. There was a large vat placed in front of his stall. On the side was a handwritten wooden sign: Wild Earthworms.The vendor noticed the little girls taking pictures and very cooperatively made a peace sign. He smiled and said, \u201cBecause I\u2019m a big-headed ghost .\u201dLittle girl: \u201cYour headpiece is so realistic. Did you make it or buy it?\u201dBig-headed ghost: \u201cIt\u2019s my own.\u201dLittle girl: \u201cCan we take a picture with you?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The big-headed ghost held onto his own head and very familiarly said in advance, \u201cBut you can\u2019t take this opportunity to try and yank my head off.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter the two little girls finished taking their picture, they directly stood off to the side and started choosing which ones they were going to post.At this time, a middle aged man walked over and peeked into the vat. His eyes immediately widened. \u201cOho, your worms are so fat. They must be farmed?\u201d\u201cAbsolutely not. They\u2019re completely wild; natural with no additives.\u201d The big-headed ghost grabbed a fat worm from the vat that was still wiggling. This scared the little girls standing off to the side so much that they shrieked and ran off.The man looked on in disbelief. \u201cYou must have half a vat? It\u2019s impossible to get so many wild worms.\u201dThe big-headed ghost said, \u201cHow is it impossible? Wild graves are moist and unpopulated. There are lots of earthworms like this there. I caught all of these this morning. See, they\u2019re still alive.\u201dAs he spoke, he shook the worms around to prove that he was telling the truth.\u201cHey hey hey, I won\u2019t argue about this with you anymore. I\u2019m just buying them as fish food.\u201d The middle aged man pulled out his phone after saying this. \u201cGet me half a catty . I\u2019ll pay with Alipay.\u201d\u201cThey really are wild. If even half of one isn\u2019t, I\u2019ll let you party on my grave,\u201d the big-headed ghost promised while he weighed and packaged the worms. \u201cHere, scan this code.\u201d\u201cThis garden party is quite interesting. I\u2019m going to head home and tell my wife to come take a look too.\u201d The man picked up his bag of worms and left, pleased. According to his words, he appeared to be a local who lived nearby.Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que finally scooted in closer. Yu Zhengdu asked the boss, \u201ch.e.l.lo. How\u2019s business been?\u201d\u201cHi Boss Shang, hi you two.\u201d The big-headed ghost was someone who caught on quickly. He eagerly greeted the two before smiling and saying, \u201cBusiness isn\u2019t so great. Only a few people who enjoy fis.h.i.+ng have come over. The girls all stay far away. But my earnings tonight are enough for me to buy a new set of clothes.\u201dYu Zhengdu nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201dThe big-headed ghost very gratefully said, \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing that Luofeng gave us this chance to join the night market. And even provided all of us with a payment code. Otherwise, we wouldn\u2019t be able to do business at all.\u201dThe Internets of the Underworld and mortal realm weren\u2019t connected. Yu Zhengdu realized that many people now used mobile payment methods, so with great insight, he had organized for Lu Lingxi to give the vendors a payment code linked to an account belonging to a mortal. After the garden party, Luofeng would calculate everybody\u2019s earnings and provide the service of purchasing items from the mortal realm and burning them.Yu Zhengdu glanced at his vat of worms, piled on top of each other and still wiggling around. He felt gooseb.u.mps appearing all over his skin. He asked, \u201cYou haven\u2019t taken this opportunity to sell some illegal products, right?\u201d\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d The big-headed ghost patted his chest. \u201cAll of our products need to pa.s.s Luofeng\u2019s strict inspections. Only those that fulfill the regulations of the mortal realm can receive a vending license.\u201dAs he spoke, he pulled out his license from under his arm. On it was Luofeng\u2019s verification stamp. \u201cSee, it has no harmful side effects for living beings. Meets the First Degree of Safety in the Underworld.\u201dThis set of safety degrees had been created by Lu Lingxi. She had worked at Luofeng for several years, so was much more familiar with the regulations of objects between the two realms than Yu Zhengdu.Upon seeing this, Yu Zhengdu nodded, relaxed. Only to see the big-headed ghost eagerly grab a single use bowl and fill it halfway with earthworms. He handed them over. \u201cHere, try some. I grabbed these from my grave. Guaranteed no additives. The texture is soft and they have high protein content. They can also increase your masculinity\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que pushed it away with his hand. He expressionlessly said, \u201cJust eat it yourself.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d The big-headed ghost didn\u2019t try to force him. He picked up a fat earthworm himself and slurped it up. \u201cThey\u2019re really very delicious. I\u2019m not lying.\u201dYu Zhengdu felt sick seeing this. He hurriedly turned around and made to leave. However, because he wasn\u2019t paying attention, someone pa.s.sing by ran into him. He almost fell and shouted, \u201cAo\u2014\u2014\u201d in surprise.\u201cBe careful.\u201d Shang Que grabbed onto his hand in a timely manner and tugged him back.\u201cThank you,\u201d Yu Zhengdu thanked after finally managing to regain his footing.\u201cLet\u2019s go. We can look up there.\u201d Shang Que took the chance to hold onto his wrist. He pulled on him to continue walking forward.\u201cUh\u2026\u2026\u201d Yu Zhengdu looked at his wrist that was still trapped in the other\u2019s hand. A strange feeling flashed through his mind; he thought that this posture seemed a bit overly intimate, but what surprised him was that it didn\u2019t annoy him being in this position. He hesitated, but ultimately didn\u2019t break free. He only followed along with tiny steps.This was the first time the Underworld was openly celebrating the Ghost Festival in the mortal realm. Luofeng\u2019s employees had an abundance of motivation, so prepared several different projects. They had even hired a large number of ghostly temporary workers, training them and organizing them to be able to achieve festivities on such a scale.Simply walking along the ghost market, Yu Zhengdu saw several strange products. Cinerary urns and mini coffins were common. There were also those selling gravestones and sharing the most popular graveyard disco playlists.Of course, there were normal products too, such as outfits and handmade crafts, as well as plenty of street food. But the street food here was different from other places. They were mostly vegetarian, like cooked unsh.e.l.led proso millet, flower oil pancakes, vegetable medley dumplings, etc. Yu Zhengdu hadn\u2019t even heard of several of them. Many tourists also hadn\u2019t. They curiously bought some to try.Shang Que explained them one by one to Yu Zhengdu. \u201cThese are all foods that were used as sacrificial offerings during the Ghost Festival in the past.\u201dYu Zhengdu nodded and casually bought a few pieces of flower oil pancake to share with Shang Que.Soon after, the two of them reached the end of the road. After exiting the ghost market, what appeared before them was a wide wooden bridge. It was very long. This piece of empty land obviously had its limits, but the other end of the bridge was hidden in a sea of darkness. From this side, one couldn\u2019t tell where the bridge led at all. This caused slight sensations of fear to creep into people\u2019s hearts.There was an extremely tall pole standing at the bridgehead. On it, three lanterns made of white paper swayed in the wind. Upon further inspection, one could tell that there were three large characters written on them: Bridge Over Troubled Water .\u201cAh, this bridge seems to be made of paper?\u201d There was a hesitant couple at the bridgehead. The girl had only just taken a step onto the surface of the bridge when she hurriedly drew her foot back again in horror.The boy patted her back. \u201cThat\u2019s just the way it looks. Otherwise, it would\u2019ve fallen a long time ago with the amount of people crossing over it.\u201dBut the girl still wasn\u2019t convinced. \u201cAiya, it\u2019s so dark on the other side. I can\u2019t see anything at all. How about we don\u2019t go over.\u201dThe boy: \u201cWhat are you scared of? There are so many people walking in that direction.\u201dThe girl furrowed her brows. \u201cDon\u2019t you think they look very strange?\u201dMany silhouettes could be seen on the Bridge Over Troubled Water. Some people walked further away while others drew closer. But all those that stepped onto the bridge seemed to naturally be covered by a strange atmosphere. From faraway, they appeared almost expressionless: their gazes were empty, as if they were zombies. This made onlookers tremble in fear.Shang Que explained to Yu Zhengdu, \u201cIt is easy to be a human, but hard to conduct yourself in a humane manner. The Bridge Over Troubled Water is what separates the mortal realm and Underworld. Walking across the Bridge Over Troubled Water is like experiencing life and death once. Those on the bridge are possibly rethinking all that has occurred in their lives so far.\u201dYu Zhengdu came to a realization. He took two steps back. \u201cThen let\u2019s not walk across. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s time for me to rethink my life yet.\u201dShang Que looked at him in amus.e.m.e.nt. \u201cThis isn\u2019t even the real Bridge Over Troubled Water. The Underworld energy is just affecting mortals a bit is all.\u201dThat couple was still arguing. The boy said, \u201cYou\u2019re overthinking it. That\u2019s the lighting causing illusions.\u201dThe girl pouted. \u201cBut I still think that it\u2019s really very scary.\u201dAs soon as she finished speaking, the girl suddenly widened her eyes. She pointed at the bridge in horror and screamed, \u201cLook, what is that\u2014\u2014\u201dFollowing her screeches, faint sounds of a suona could be heard from the other end of the bridge.Yu Zhengdu couldn\u2019t help looking over too, only to see a bridal procession dressed in historical attire suddenly appear on the wide bridge. That procession was extremely large, slowly appearing from the darkness on the other end of the Bridge Over Troubled Water and becoming visible.There were four female servants leading the way. Their hair was tied up in two small buns. Two held lanterns and two carried baskets. Behind them were people playing the suona, hitting the gongs, holding up umbrellas, carrying dowry chests, etc.As the procession got closer and closer, those people\u2019s faces became clearer and clearer. The sounds of the suona and gongs got louder and louder too. They entered onlookers\u2019 ears, causing their eardrums to ring. But this scene that was supposed to be quite cheery gave people an inexplicably strange feeling.Yu Zhengdu took a closer look and finally discovered why it gave off such a strange aura.The bridal procession\u2019s movements were completely in sync. They were so synchronized that they seemed like wooden people and didn\u2019t look alive at all; their faces were as pale as paper, but were covered with heavy makeup, making them appear similar to mannequins painted over. Their faces were expressionless and there was no light in their eyes. In comparison to the bright red outfits they wore, this contrast was even more obvious and creepy.Even more bizarre, as they walked, they threw white paper money. The paper money flitted through the air, appearing like white b.u.t.terflies in the night sky.This cross between a joyful procession and a funeral gave people an eerie feeling at first glance.As the procession got nearer, the end of it slowly completely appeared from where it was originally hidden in the dark.That was a red palanquin carried by eight bearers. The eight bearers all had different appearances. Some had green faces and fangs, some had open wounds flowing with blood on their heads, and there was even one whose face was split in half while his entire body was covered in blood. They, like the rest of the procession, were expressionless, carrying the palanquin and steadily making their way out of the darkness.There were flowers tied on all four corners of the palanquin. It was extremely luxurious. A corner of the red curtain gently lifted with the evening wind, almost as if seducing onlookers to step closer and get a better look.The procession gradually walked forward. Under the horrified gazes of onlookers, they arrived at the end of the Bridge Over Troubled Water. Then, the sound of the suona suddenly stopped. The foremost person raised his voice and shouted, \u201cThe Ghost King is escorting his bride\u2014\u2014 Mortals stay away\u2014\u2014\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe girl in the couple had long since gotten so frightened that she had hidden herself away into the boy\u2019s arms. She cried, \u201cLet\u2019s hurry and go back. I\u2019m so scared\u2014\u2014\u201dOnly to see the curtain of the palanquin carried by eight bearers get drawn back. The heads of two girls popped out. They excitedly waved at the couple and shouted, \u201cAh Yi, you guys are here too? Do you want to get into this bridal palanquin with us?\u201dThe couple: \u201c\u2026\u2026???\u201dEspecially the girlfriend who had almost gotten scared out of wits. She turned to look at the two girls in the palanquin, expression bewildered. In a daze, she asked, \u201cHow come it\u2019s you guys?\u201dShang Que couldn\u2019t hold himself back anymore. He dragged the first person in the procession over and asked, \u201cWhat are you guys doing?\u201dAs soon as that person saw Shang Que, they hurriedly started smiling ingratiatingly. \u201ch.e.l.lo Boss Shang. This is our creative event\u2014\u2014the Ghost King escorts his bride. You don\u2019t even know how many little girls want to pretend to be a ghostly bride once in their lives. Our business has been the best this entire evening.\u201dAs if to prove that what he was saying was the truth, several tourists off to the side swarmed over and excitedly asked, \u201cMay I ask, can we do this as long as we pay?\u201d\u201cYes, yes.\u201d That person very familiarly pulled out his payment code. He smiled and said, \u201cFifteen minutes for one round, only 200. At most, three people can sit in it at the same time. And we have special workers who can follow along to take photos throughout the entire fifteen minutes. We guarantee that we will preserve your most beautiful moment.\u201dYu Zhengdu patted Shang Que\u2019s shoulder meaningfully. \u201cThe Ghost King has quite good fortune in love affairs tonight.\u201dShang Que: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d<b>The author has something to say:</b>Shang Que: Tonight I\u2019m going to start feasting!All the other ghosts: I\u2019m inviting everyone to come party at my grave tonight!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54 - The Eight Underworld Mountain ViewsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 54 - The Eight Underworld Mountain Views\u201cWe\u2019re here. This is the place.\u201d Gao Duidui lifted up the phone attached to a selfie stick as he livestreamed. His face was filled with shock. \u201cMy goodness, this garden party is on such a large scale?\u201dGao Duidui was a small supernatural livestreamer on Big Eye Livestream. Normally, he told ghost stories during his livestreams. Occasionally, he would also visit haunted houses or other supposedly supernatural locations.Borrowing the current trend of the Ghost Festival, Gao Duidui had planned a whole series of outdoor livestreams for the Ghost Month. He specially visited some famous haunted places; though he didn\u2019t actually run into any ghosts, the eerie settings in addition to his skills at telling ghost stories resulted in fairly good feedback after half a month. His popularity kept rising.But today, Gao Duidui encountered a small Waterloo . One of the haunted places he had done research on was an abandoned factory on the outskirts of Fu City\u2019s developmental area. Apparently, that piece of land had originally been a wild graveyard. In recent years, after the factory\u2019s owners moved away and the factory became abandoned, stories of hauntings slowly spread. And, they seemed to be gaining traction, having already become Fu City\u2019s newest urban legends.A desolate place, a factory, and a wild graveyard. The culmination of so many horrifying concepts made Gao Duidui antic.i.p.ate this location a lot. He had started promoting for it several days ahead of time and had specially scheduled the livestream for the day before the Zhongyuan Festival. He was preparing to reach a new height in his streaming career.However, he hadn\u2019t thought that not only would he not achieve the expected results, he would actually almost get beaten up by someone instead\u2014\u2014it turned out that the hauntings in the factory had actually been made up and publicized by the owners of the factory.In recent years, the developmental district had been under heavy renovation. The original factory had been forced to move away due to pollution issues, but the compensation for their forced removal hadn\u2019t been properly settled. Thus, they were very unhappy. Consequently, after leaving, the factory owners hired a few gang members to cause trouble at the grounds of the abandoned factory. Because they often did this at night, after a few times, rumors of ghosts started spreading about in this area. The factory helped spread several similar rumors with the ultimate goal of making whoever was set to take over this piece of land lose money.Gao Duidui wanted to take the opportunity of the Ghost Festival to increase the dramatic atmosphere of his livestream. The factory owners had the same idea as him. Recently, they had found the same gang members to stir trouble again. In the end, Gao Duidui happened upon a group of hooligans while alone. He wasn\u2019t in the mood to tell his audience members ghost stories at all. After being glared at by the others and threatened with a raised brick, he hurriedly ran away, extremely cowed.Because of this unexpected incident during his livestream, Gao Duidui couldn\u2019t help but feel put out. He was originally planning on ending the stream early; unexpectedly, though, someone mentioned in the comments that there was a Ghost Festival garden party being held outside a nearby shopping center. It was already taking over their Moments. However, as the location was truly out of the way and the date was truly special, though several people were interested, they couldn\u2019t actually visit.Since Gao Duidui was already in the developmental district, he decided to go check it out. This way, he could also help those audience members who were still undecided see if the event was truly as interesting as their friends were saying.In all honesty, Gao Duidui hadn\u2019t been expecting much from the garden party at all in the beginning. After all, he hadn\u2019t even heard of it before, so a.s.sumed that it was only a temporary event put together by a small company. Besides, it was located in such a desolate place like the developmental district. According to his guesses, this was most likely going to be something similar to a night market or something. They were only trying to borrow the name of the Ghost Festival to gain popularity.But he still had a lot of time left before he needed to end his stream. Thus, after brief thought, he decided that since he was already here and that things couldn\u2019t possibly get worse, he would go. He asked for the exact address before picking out a public bicycle and riding off to the location.He hadn\u2019t expected that this unknown garden party would actually be on such a scale. That it would actually have such intricate configurations and this much popularity.\u201cMy goodness, which company is in charge of this event? It\u2019s too amazing!\u201d Gao Duidui exclaimed as he walked by. He first pa.s.sed through the ghost market. Disregarding the flowing white lanterns and spirit summoning banners that decorated all corners, beautiful architecture, and strange types of products, just the ghosts and monsters of all shapes, sizes, and forms provided enough footage for him.The response in the comments was very lively:\u3010Wowowow, the green-faced ghost wearing two fangs on the left is so terrifying. He scared me!!!!\u3011\u3010Terrifying my a.s.s. Don\u2019t you see him making finger hearts at the tourists!!!\u3011\u3010Exactly. He\u2019s not even as disgusting as that one strangling himself with his intestines\u2026\u2026\u3011\u3010Goodness, is that vendor selling miniature coffins????? They\u2019re so exquisite, I actually kind of want to buy one\u2026\u2026\u3011\u3010I\u2019m going to be honest, I\u2019m a little interested in those blue-and-white porcelain cinerary urns\u2026\u2026the craftsmans.h.i.+p is too stunning\u3011\u3010Aaaah, I originally didn\u2019t really want to go after seeing my friends\u2019 posts, but now that I\u2019m watching the livestream, I feel more and more tempted\u3011\u3010Hehe, I\u2019ve already finished changing and am preparing to leave the house\u2026\u2026\u3011\u3010Someone from out of town cries bitter and jealous tears\u2026\u2026Duidui film some more \u3011Gao Duidui was very excited about this too. Since he had entered the garden party, his livestream room\u2019s popularity had started increasing at a noticeable speed. Many of those in the comments had also started calling their friends to come and watch too.Actually, even if not to livestream and only to visit for fun, he would enjoy it a lot as well. This garden party was of much better quality than he had antic.i.p.ated. Without exaggerating, even a professional theme park might not be able to achieve such stellar results.From the architecture to the vendors to the products to the activities, this party was extremely detailed and unique. Beyond this, the staff\u2019s makeup and costumes were realistic too. Even Gao Duidui, a streamer specializing in supernatural topics, couldn\u2019t find any mistakes with these ghost-imitating costumes.Gao Duidui felt like he had gained a blessing out of the misfortune he had experienced earlier in the night. His patience was surprisingly great; he practically agreed to all of the requests in the comments. While reading the comments, he also listened to the audience\u2019s suggestions and changed his camera angles in response.He was pretty good at livestreaming, completely capturing those swaying lanterns, flittering pieces of paper money, intricate but eerie architecture, and horrifying but surprisingly cute ghosts with his lens.By the time Gao Duidui had walked out of the ghost market, his stream popularity had already surpa.s.sed his highest personal record.Gao Duidui held up a string of mini coffins in front of the camera and shook them. He smiled, \u201cThank you everyone for your support. I just bought these in the ghost market. In a bit, I\u2019m going to have a raffle as a gift for today\u2019s Ghost Festival special program.\u201dThose in the comments who couldn\u2019t personally visit exploded. They started furiously leaving comments, telling the streamer to look at them.Because of this, Gao Duidui started interacting with them again before continuing forward. \u201cThis garden party is so big. I don\u2019t know which company planned it, but their prowess is too amazing.\u201dAs soon as he finished saying this, he suddenly widened his eyes. A shocked expression appeared on his face. When he spoke, he even started stuttering. \u201cOh my goodness. This- this\u2026\u2026this can\u2019t be the Eight Underworld Mountain Views?\u201dAs a rather professional and dedicated supernatural streamer, Gao Duidui didn\u2019t only focus on supernatural topics to impress the audience. In actuality, he was also quite interested in these topics personally, and had also done his homework on related stories.In his past livestreams, he often added in background information regarding these topics. Such as the Eight Underworld Mountain Views he was bringing up now. He had introduced them to his audience members previously.The Eight Underworld Mountain Views referred to the more famous places in the Underworld. They commonly appeared in ghost stories or folklore and were: the Gate of h.e.l.l, the Bridge Over Troubled Water, the Stripping Pavilion, the Home Viewing Terrace, the Evil Dog Village, the Rubbish Money Mountain, the Bloodstained Pond, and Mengpo\u2019s Shop.The names of these places had been pa.s.sed down since ancient times and often appeared simultaneously with h.e.l.l. Especially the Gate of h.e.l.l, Bridge Over Troubled Water, and Home Viewing Terrace. These places could be considered known by everyone. Though these days society already believed that these locations had been made up by the people of the past, there were still those that believed that since these places could be spoken about for thousands of years and across different dynasties, the stories about them couldn\u2019t have appeared out of nowhere.Gao Duidui didn\u2019t truly believe in such things. After all, if he did, he probably wouldn\u2019t dare to be a supernatural streamer. However, he had done his research. In addition, he was extremely interested in the places spoken of in the legends. In the past, he had brought them up with his audience often.But regardless of himself or his old audience members, none had ever expected that one day, they would be able to see a human replication of the Eight Underworld Mountain Views.In response, Gao Duidui instantly transformed into a state similar to that of an otaku seeing the scenes in their animes and mangas being reproduced in real life. And with pa.s.sion because the quality was excellent and true to the original.\u201cEveryone look at this. This is the Home Viewing Terrace. You guys have probably heard of this one a lot. In the past, someone even wrote a poem about it. What was it called again\u2026\u2026\u201dAn audience member with a comparatively impressive knowledge of literature immediately said:\u3010\u201cI turn back but cannot return to Linchuan . In the Underworld, I fas.h.i.+on a Home Viewing Terrace.\u201d\u3011Gao Duidui: \u201cRight right right, that\u2019s exactly it. I told everyone before that the Home Viewing Terrace is located by the entrance to the Underworld. After ghosts and spirits step onto it, they can see their hometowns from when they were alive. Here, they would bid farewell to the mortal realm, which is why this terrace is also called \u2018Place I Think of Home\u2019. Right now, let me take you guys to see\u2026\u2026\u201dGao Duidui stepped onto the magnificent terrace and held his phone up in front of him. He joked, \u201cHow is it? Can everyone see their hometowns?\u201dThe comments suddenly increased:\u3010See my a.s.s. It\u2019s so dark that I can\u2019t see anything\u3011\u3010Wait, I seem to see the sign from my hometown?? It must be an illusion, right?\u3011\u3010I see a sea of lights. It\u2019s very blurry, so I can\u2019t see it clearly, but it seems somewhat familiar?\u3011\u3010I think I also see something? It\u2019s so familiar\u2026\u2026but I can\u2019t see it clearly\u3011\u3010Comment-actors, are you for real? You clearly can\u2019t see anything, okay?\u3011\u3010Comments, stop scaring people. I almost thought that I had gone blind\u2026\u2026\u3011Gao Duidui looked at the comments. He was a bit confused, so scratched his head and said, \u201cHaha, everyone must have been tricked by the lights. This garden party is very interesting. Many places don\u2019t look very big, and are very clearly well illuminated, but you just can\u2019t see the other side from the one you\u2019re on\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cLike the Bridge Over Troubled Water. Didn\u2019t we just walk across it? It wasn\u2019t that long, but you really can\u2019t see the other end at all. How mysterious. I give this production team 100 points.\u201dAs he walked off the Home Viewing Terrace, he instinctively looked back. For some reason, the scene that had previously been a sea of darkness in his eyes suddenly s.h.i.+fted into a blur of faraway lights. They quickly went out, but that unexpected flash had revealed something strangely familiar. He couldn\u2019t tell what it was, but it immediately hit him deep inside.For some reason, a strong feeling of nostalgia quickly arose in his heart.\u201cEy\u2014\u2014\u201d Gao Duidui couldn\u2019t help sighing lowly. He only regained his wits after walking a distance away from the Home Viewing Terrace.Gao Duidui felt that something was off, but couldn\u2019t quite put his finger on what exactly was off. In the end, he could only scratch his head and tell the audience, \u201cThis garden party is really very interesting. I suggest that those friends who have free time come and check it out. I\u2019m sincerely recommending it. I haven\u2019t received any ad money!\u201dPerhaps because of the influence of the Home Viewing Terrace, Gao Duidui started being even more attentive in his introductions. He slowly pa.s.sed by each of the Eight Underworld Mountain Views.He was quite knowledgeable in these matters. As he walked, he shared his knowledge and also told some folk tales about each attraction. Such as the scene from the famous Gui Chuzi\u2019s\u300a Dream of the Red Chamber Supplements \u300bwhere \u201cMother Jia visited new sights at the Evil Dog Village, Sister Feng poured out old vinegar at the Home Viewing Terrace\u201d. He also filmed some of the ghosts near the attractions and some special activities. After several hours of livestreaming, he somehow didn\u2019t feel tired at all. As more time pa.s.sed, more and more people joined his room.After visiting all Eight Underworld Mountain Views, Gao Duidui\u2019s viewer count was already extremely close to the count of Big Eye Livestream\u2019s most popular streamers.Gao Duidui immediately became shocked. Upon closer inspection, he realized that an a.s.sistant from the platform had sent him a message. Because the interactions were frequent in his room, he, who had never really been paid attention to, had suddenly been placed on the suggestions list on the opening page of the app. This was something he hadn\u2019t even dared to dream about in the past.Gao Duidui was very satisfied. He looked at the time and realized that it had already somehow reached midnight. But he still didn\u2019t feel ready to end the livestream. Fortunately, the event organizers of this garden party seemed to be dedicated to the theme of the Ghost Festival. Even though it was the middle of the night, they didn\u2019t appear to be preparing to end at all. The staff were still alert and working; however, there were several tourists who couldn\u2019t stand it anymore and had gone home first. But in comparison, there were more young people unafraid of staying up late who were being newly attracted.Consequently, though it was already very late, the garden party\u2019s crowds weren\u2019t any less than they had been earlier.Gao Duidui had continuously streamed for several hours, so obviously his energy levels couldn\u2019t keep up. It was a good thing, though, that he had come prepared with several portable chargers. At least his phone wouldn\u2019t run out of battery.He was reluctant to stop broadcasting, thus found a rock under a large tree by the Troubled Water River and sat down. He continued occasionally chatting with the audience:\u201c , this garden party is really very fun. The main organizers not only have a lot of prowess, but are also very sincere. The details are extremely intricate. How wonderful it would be if they could keep it open for longer.\u201d\u201cThanks for everyone\u2019s belief in me. If everyone likes my content, you can watch my livestreams more from now on. I will continue to introduce everyone to more information on topics like these\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHaha, if there was one thing I had to complain about, it would be that tonight\u2019s livestream wasn\u2019t scary enough\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI know that everyone really hopes I can run into a ghost. I also really hope that I can run into a ghost to show everyone. This way, I won\u2019t be wasting my supernatural streamer t.i.tle. But I really don\u2019t have the opportunity to run into a ghost anymore tonight\u2026\u2026\u201dGao Duidui joked around while holding his selfie stick up higher. He said, \u201cEveryone look over there. That\u2019s the ghost market. There are so many people; even if there really are ghosts, they wouldn\u2019t dare to come out now. \u201dAs he spoke, he pulled his phone back down. When he looked at the screen, he realized that it had gotten covered with a sudden influx of comments. The speed at which they were appearing caused him to fall into confusion.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What\u2019s caused everyone to become so excited\u2026\u2026\u201d Gao Duidui asked while drawing closer to his phone to read the contents of the comments.\u3010f.u.c.k f.u.c.k f.u.c.k f.u.c.k!!!!!!!!!!\u3011\u3010Holy f.u.c.k!!!!! That scared laozi to death!!!!!!\u3011\u3010Duidui, hurry and run!!! Hurry!!\u3011\u3010f.u.c.k, I threw my phone away\u3011\u3010That scared laozi to death. Streamer, you\u2019re on your own!!\u3011\u3010Duidui, don\u2019t look up. Whatever you do, don\u2019t!\u3011\u3010Duidui, close your eyes and run away!\u3011\u3010Trust me, don\u2019t look up. I\u2019m being serious!\u3011\u3010Don\u2019t lift your head up! Whatever you do, don\u2019t lift your head up!\u3011All the newest comments were telling Gao Duidui not to lift his head. Gao Duidui\u2019s entire being was lost. In his heart, he realized that something was happening, but the more the comments told him not to look up, the more curious he became.In the end, curiosity prevailed over his survival instinct. Amidst an innumerous amount of comments trying to stop him, he slowly leaned his head back.\u201cHoly f.u.c.k\u2014\u2014\u201d Gao Duidui let out a horrified shriek. He lost strength in his muscles and fell back uncontrollably. Even his phone and selfie stick flew off to the side.In order to more conveniently chat with the audience, Gao Duidui had found a rather isolated area under a tree shrouded in darkness on the other end of the Bridge Over Troubled Water. There were no tourists around at all.But in the moment that he looked up, the first thing that entered his line of sight was a pair of vibrant, blood-red pumps. This was followed by the ashen-white calves of a pale woman.When he fell over and laid on the ground, he finally managed to get a complete view of the owner of that pair of shoes.She was a young woman dressed in a one piece red dress with red heels, long red nails, and blood-red lipstick.Juxtaposed was her ashen, almost to the point of being black, skin, bulging purple veins, bulging eyes, and cold air that seemed to be emanating off of her.She was just hanging straight from the tree and appeared almost dried out. Her body swayed gently in the wind.A woman who had been hanged.\u201cAaah\u2014\u2014\u201d Gao Duidui shouted loudly in utter shock. He struggled to crawl to his feet, but his limbs felt weak. After a few attempts, he had only managed to scooch a few inches forward, but hadn\u2019t managed to stand up.\u201cSave me, there\u2019s a ghost here\u2014\u2014there\u2019s a real ghost\u2014\u2014\u201d Gao Duidui felt cold sweat cover his body. He wanted to yell for help, but his throat felt tight. In the end, he could only make a noise akin to the loudness of a mosquito\u2019s buzz.At the same time, the woman on the tree seemed to have been attracted by his shrieks. Her bulging eyes slowly rolled downwards. She coldly glanced at him.Gao Duidui: !!!!Now, he couldn\u2019t even find the courage to scream.This was the supposed \u201ctake too many midnight paths and you\u2019ll ultimately run into a ghost\u201d . Gao Duidui closed his eyes in despair, waiting for the female ghost to make her way over. At this time, someone suddenly tried to help him up. Immediately after, a sweet little girl\u2019s voice sounded out: \u201cGege, you\u2019ve fallen down. I\u2019ll help you get up.\u201dGao Duidui turned around in panic. Thus, he finally discovered the three little kids who had appeared next to him at some unknown time.The little girl helping him up looked to be around five or six. She looked sweet and cute. While trying to help him sit up, she told the little boy next to her, \u201cGeorgie, you come help gege up too. It counts for good merits!\u201dGao Duidui didn\u2019t have the energy to worry about what the little girl was saying. He only hurriedly told the three children, \u201cKiddos, hurry and run. Hurry and go to someplace where there are a lot of people. It\u2019s dangerous here\u2014\u2014\u201dHe was scared that he would traumatize the kids, so didn\u2019t dare to directly tell them that there was a ghost. But he couldn\u2019t help scanning the top of the tree with his peripheral vision, terrified that the female ghost would do something to the children.While he was in the middle of panicking, he saw the little girl turn her head to look up at the view. Then, she revealed a large smile and raised a hand to wave. She happily said, \u201ch.e.l.lo hangwoman jiejie. How come you\u2019re all the way over here?\u201dGao Duidui: \u201c\u2026\u2026??\u201dBefore he had time to feel confused, he saw the female ghost on the tree smile too. She waved at the little girl. \u201cHi Peppa. It\u2019s higher up here, so the air quality is better. I also have a nicer view\u2026\u2026\u201dAs she spoke, she pointed to somewhere far off in the distance. \u201cI just saw your gege and Boss Shang holding hands and walking in that direction.\u201dThe little girl nodded. \u201cI know. Uncle Kang said there\u2019s going to be a procession in a bit. They\u2019re definitely going to watch that. Hangwoman jiejie, do you want to watch with us?\u201dThe hangwoman shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s too crowded over there. And I can see from here just fine.\u201dAs he watched the little girl chatting so happily with the female ghost on the tree, Gao Duidui\u2019s entire being felt not okay. He brokenly asked, \u201cSo you\u2019re not a real ghost?\u201d\u201cI am. I\u2019m a hangwoman, can\u2019t you tell?\u201d The female ghost glared at him and said with disdain, \u201cYou\u2019re so scary. Screaming out of the blue like that. You scared me so much that I almost got hanged again!\u201dGao Duidui: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe could only say that the ghosts in this garden party were too realistic and too in character.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55 - Hundred Ghost Night ProcessionPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 55 - Hundred Ghost Night ProcessionWhile I was translating, I found a Chinese website that contains pictures and backstories of these ancient ghosts/monsters which was really cool to look at. It\u2019s too much to link each page to each ghost that was mentioned in this chapter, but in the TN\u2019s I\u2019ve included the original Chinese names for these ghosts (that are on the site, as the site doesn\u2019t contain every ghost ever) so that you can copy/paste them into the search bar on the site and look at the pictures if you want. They may not be 100% the same as the author\u2019s descriptions because after all, these are mythological beings that no one has ever seen, but it\u2019s still nice if you want a visual aid. Also, Google translate doesn\u2019t do a terrible job translating the backstories if you\u2019re interested in those. Link here: http://www.cbaigui.com/Though the hangwoman still looked very creepy, after seeing that she was even more cowardly than him, it was quite difficult for Gao Duidui to feel that kind of fear again.He slowly crawled to his feet and looked at the children with a smile. \u201cLittle buddies, thank you for helping me up earlier.\u201dThe little girl spun around in a circle. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. My gege taught me that when I leave the house, I need to get in the habit of doing lots of good things.\u201dShe was wearing an Elsa gown and appeared extremely cute.Gao Duidui was instantly taken. He put his hands up to his face and cooed, \u201cWow, kiddo. You\u2019re a little fairy, right?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d The little girl shook her head and very seriously stated, \u201cI\u2019m Little Belly Spirit.\u201dThe little boy wearing a pumpkin costume standing next to her added eerily, \u201cI\u2019m k.u.man Thong .\u201dThe little girl also said, \u201cHe\u2019s an immigrant from Thailand.\u201dAnother little boy wearing all black and carrying a sword b.u.t.ted in, \u201cI\u2019m Guilong.\u201dAfter the three of them finished speaking, another voice suddenly sounded out from the direction of the tree. \u201cI\u2019m Bei\u2026\u2026\u201dGao Duidui turned around to look, only to see a young girl with long hair hiding behind the tree trunk, shyly poking a head out.Gao Duidui politely nodded at her. \u201ch.e.l.lo.\u201dUpon hearing this, the girl\u2019s face collapsed and she hurriedly hid herself away again.He heard the little kid cosplaying the guilong say, \u201cAiya, don\u2019t talk to her la. She\u2019ll start to feel self-pity.\u201dGao Duidui: \u201c????\u201d\u201cGege, you dropped your phone,\u201d the little girl said while pointing to somewhere close by.\u201cOh oh, right.\u201d Gao Duidui finally remembered that he was still livestreaming. He hurriedly picked up his phone. After doing so, he wanted to thank the kids, but when he turned around, he found that they had already completely disappeared.Gao Duidui: \u2026\u2026 Do kids these days run so fast now? And without making any noise.He scratched his head but didn\u2019t have time to keep wondering. He urgently needed to check on the livestream situation. When he looked, he immediately became shocked. The viewer count of his livestream channel had actually risen to the top, becoming the number one most viewed currently running livestream on Big Eye Livestream.Gao Duidui checked the comments and app back end system in a daze. He finally understood what had happened.It turned out that after he fell, his audience couldn\u2019t see what was happening. They all thought he really ran into a ghost. This was the first time a supernatural livestreamer had run into a ghost on stream. And, the ghost he had run into was the legendary evil ghost of a hangwoman wearing a red dress and red heels.His popularity that night had originally been quite high. After this fall, there was something for audience members to focus on. Not only did the livestream app use his stream as promotion on the front page, netizens on other social media apps also got to work. The screenshot of those red heels and ashen white calves had already spread everywhere, successfully scaring a majority of netizens. More people rushed to join in, waiting to see what would happen next.The comments were full of anxious messages awaiting his reply:\u3010Duidui, are you okay?\u3011\u3010f.u.c.k f.u.c.k, I really cried out of fear\u3011\u3010What to do? Should we help Duidui call the cops?\u3011\u3010Wait a bit, it\u2019s only been a few minutes. We still don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened\u2026\u2026\u3011\u3010How would you explain this to the cops? Tell them that you\u2019ve run into a ghost?\u3011Gao Duidui hurriedly pointed the lens at his own face. \u201cDon\u2019t worry everybody. I\u2019m fine.\u201dThe comments immediately heaved a sigh of relief. Then, they instantly started asking him about what was going on.Gao Duidui was abashed for a moment. He didn\u2019t know how to explain things to the audience either. He could only lift his head and give the hangwoman a rundown of the situation, then ask her if she could join him in his livestream.The hangwoman slowly rolled her eyes down. Her face was cold. Gao Duidui thought that she wasn\u2019t willing. He was just about to tell her that she didn\u2019t need to if she didn\u2019t want to, when he heard her drawl out, \u201cFilm from the left side. My left profile looks better.\u201dGao Duidui: \u201c\u2026\u2026Okay.\u201dAfter saying this, he lifted his camera up, filming the hangwoman while explaining to the audience. \u201cActually, I didn\u2019t run into a ghost just now. She\u2019s a worker at the garden party. Take a look, everyone\u2026\u2026\u201dIn the camera, the hangwoman revealed an eerie smile filled with death to the audience.Comments:\u3010???\u3011\u3010\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026f.u.c.k!!!\u3011\u3010Duidui you\u2019ve been lied to, right! This is clearly a ghost!!\u3011\u3010I\u2019m in complete awe of this garden party\u2026\u2026\u3011\u3010Actors can hang from trees like this? I don\u2019t see any wire harnesses????\u3011\u3010Even if it\u2019s fake, I still cried out of fear\u2026\u2026\u3011The audience hadn\u2019t expected at all that the \u2018encountering a ghost\u2019 story would end in this way. For a moment, some even started cussing in agitation; others still couldn\u2019t help being scared. Either way, his livestream had become completely famous this time. Additionally, Gao Duidui and the garden party successfully exited the circle.Especially the screenshot of the hangwoman\u2019s calves and her red heels, along with her creepy smile. It eventually became a common picture used in posts designed to scare netizens\u2026\u2026Of course, these were the only two screenshots that could fool those people who didn\u2019t know the entirety of the situation. Because shortly after, Gao Duidui started to casually converse with the hangwoman. The hangwoman was pretty chatty too. She even knew how to interact with the audience.\u201cI hanged myself over a decade ago. A love wound, because of a love wound. Ey, it really wasn\u2019t worth it. After dying, that a.s.shole wasn\u2019t even sad for long before finding someone newk2026;k2026;\u201d\u201cWearing a red dress and heels when hanging yourself doesn\u2019t actually help at all. Because the Underworld has very strict laws, so we can\u2019t go seek revenge on mortals\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cCan you find your deceased relatives in the garden party? No. There are rules about that. Ghosts that have been dead for less than a decade need to wear makeup and change their appearance before coming out. Otherwise, there would be no order left\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThe product most worth buying from the ghost market? I recommend the calligraphy sold by the grandpa at the seventh stall. He used to be a pretty famous calligrapher in life. His works should be pretty valuable\u2026\u2026\u201dThe audience couldn\u2019t help laughing while interacting with her:\u3010 233333 this little jiejie is too professional. Good ratings for how in character she is\u3011\u3010In the past, I heard that the staff at theme parks outside the country were required to stay in character at all times. They can\u2019t ever break character so that the guests really believe they\u2019re in a fairy tale world. Didn\u2019t know that these exist in our country too\u3011\u3010Exactly. I almost truly believed that this little jiejie really did hang herself\u3011\u3010And it\u2019s a perfectly bug-free background story. I trust that n.o.body has encountered a ghost of someone they knew before because the newly dead can\u2019t use their own faces 2333\u3011\u3010A famous deceased calligrapher grandpa hahaha\u2026\u2026this garden party has built such a realistic world. I\u2019m in love, in love\u3011While everyone was in the middle of happily chatting, an uproar suddenly sounded out in the direction of the Eight Underworld Mountain Views. Gao Duidui turned his head to look, only to see a large swarm of people making their way over. The hangwoman glanced in that direction too. She said, \u201cOh, the procession is about to start.\u201dGao Duidui asked in shock, \u201cThere\u2019s also a procession?\u201dHangwoman: \u201cYes. During zis.h.i.+ , the Gate of h.e.l.l opens and the Hundred Ghost Night Procession begins.\u201dGao Duidui was immediately captivated. Though the audience didn\u2019t want to part with Ms. Hangwoman, they also wanted to see the procession. This was a rare opportunity, so Gao Duidui reluctantly bid farewell to the hangwoman and ran in the direction of the Gate of h.e.l.l.Gao Duidui got there a bit late. When he arrived at the main street the procession was going to be held at, both sides were already filled with people. There were also workers of strange shapes and sizes maintaining order, ensuring that the path was clear.Gao Duidui had no other options. After finally finding a relatively closer spot on the Bridge Over Troubled Water, he aimed his camera in the correct direction. Fortunately, the procession only officially started after he finished fiddling with his phone.He heard a loud \u201cbang\u2014\u2014\u201d. In the distance, a thick cloud of smoke rose into the air, accompanied by the festive and loud sound of firecrackers. A group slowly made their way out of the thick smoke.The Zhongyuan Festival Procession officially began.Previously, Gao Duidui had specially done research on the customs related to the Zhongyuan Festival. Now, he could use all this knowledge. As he watched, he explained to the audience, \u201cThese are called incense firecrackers. They\u2019re also called burned buns\u2026\u2026\u201dA young tourist nearby didn\u2019t understand what was going on and was also asking a staff member about it. The staff member patiently clarified.It turned out that the first half of the procession would be a performance of the customs of the Zhongyuan Festival. Aside from incense firecrackers, there would also be sacrifices to the land and other similar acts.The procession was very long. Each group had different costumes and equipment coinciding with different themes. After a certain distance, the groups would stop at their predetermined locations, set up, and begin their performances.Gao Duidui was on the Bridge Over Troubled Water. Following the appearance of the groups releasing sky lanterns and wis.h.i.+ng for good harvests, he saw a group of young women wearing dresses with narrow sleeves slowly make their way over.The young women were all very attractive. Their dresses were elaborate and their faces were covered in makeup. They walked delicately and rhythmically, garnering pleased reactions from tourists.In their hands, they carried lotus lanterns. When they got to the end of the Bridge Over Troubled Water, they got into a straight line and, accompanied by the drawling tones of a guqin , gently placed the lanterns into the Troubled Water.Gao Duidui explained to his viewers, \u201cThe release of lanterns is a fairly important custom during the Zhongyuan Festival. It\u2019s also called \u2018Pa.s.sing Along Lonely Ones With Lanterns\u2019. Scholars believe that it originated from the customs of the Shangyuan Festival, otherwise known as the Yuanxiao Festival. Because the Shangyuan Festival is for humans, people fly lanterns on the earth. But the Zhongyuan festival is a ghost festival. Thus, they release lanterns into the water\u2026\u2026\u201dThe people believed: humans were yang, spirits were yin, the earth was yang, water was yin.The world underwater was mysterious and eerie, just like the Underworld and h.e.l.l. Ghosts and spirits spent their days there.The purposes of releasing lanterns into the river were to bless spirits and help them peacefully travel to the other side. The people believed that if ghosts in the Underworld carried a lantern with them, they would be able to reincarnate.The audience listened to Gao Duidui\u2019s explanation while watching the scene unfolding along the Troubled Water.Speaking of, the Troubled Water of this garden party was very strange. It actually wasn\u2019t true running water, but the event organizers had used some mysterious material to create the illusion that it was. Earlier, when Gao Duidui had taken everyone on a tour of the Eight Underworld Mountain Views, he had taken a close look at it. It appeared to be some optical illusion created by special lighting effects.But through the lens, it truly looked like a real river. What was different, though, was that the water was the color of a thick, reddish black. From afar, it even seemed to be flowing rapidly.According to legend, the Troubled Water was a river flowing from the sea of the Underworld. Endless black water, rolling red currents, possibly cold as ice, possibly hot as fire; in reaction to each individual, it changed its depth.Currently, the lanterns slowly drifted off. The hazy lights covered the surface of the river, subtly revealing the world under the water.There seemed to be spirits drowning and evil ghosts struggling.It made people feel sorrow and pity.For a moment, not only did the tourists physically present sigh, but the audience members watching the livestream couldn\u2019t help but also sigh.Of course, a majority of the reason was that they were praising the event organizers for a job well done.A further distance away, closer to the Gate of h.e.l.l, Shang Que was also in the middle of explaining these customs that had been pa.s.sed down for thousands of years to Yu Zhengdu.Many more visitors had shown up than they had expected. Though it was very late, the amount of people visiting after learning about the event hadn\u2019t diminished at all. The two sides of the procession path were filled with tourists. At first, Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que had been standing shoulder to shoulder. But later on, it got more and more crowded. The two of them were forced to stand one in front of the other.Shang Que was scared that someone would b.u.mp into Yu Zhengdu again. Thus, he gently rested his arm on Yu Zhengdu\u2019s waist.Yu Zhengdu was a bit embarra.s.sed, but very soon, the first half of the procession ended. The clock hands exactly pointed to midnight. The Zhongyuan Ghost Festival was officially here.From the darkest parts of the night, a soft shout sounded from afar:\u201cSeventh Month of the mortal realm, the Earth Official pardons all sins\u2014\u2014\u201d\u201cOpen the doors of the Earth Palace, let the spirit lights guide the way\u2014\u2014\u201d\u201cHundred Ghost Night Procession, living people stay away\u2014\u2014\u201d\u201cPardon\u2014\u2014\u201dThat voice seemed distant and faraway. No one could tell where it originated from, but it fell into the ears of everyone present.Shortly after, a deep \u201c zhiya \u2014\u2014\u201d sounded. The large and exquisite Gate of h.e.l.l slowly opened. A thick stream of smoke drifted out from the darkness behind the gate. In only an instant, audience members felt that they had been sucked into the Underworld.Following the opening of the gate and the dissipation of the smoke, faint lights suddenly appeared in the doorway. A while pa.s.sed before everyone could finally tell what those lights were.An innumerable amount of sky lanterns flew out from inside, and, like that shout stated at the beginning, spirit lights were guiding the way for the hundred ghosts.The spirit lights rose into the night sky as inside the Gate of h.e.l.l, a loud \u201chongran\u2014\u2014\u201d sounded out.The Hundred Ghost Night Procession had officially begun.The originally drowsy crowd suddenly became alert. They started cheerily excitedly and desperately tried to push their way forward, terrified that they would miss anything interesting.And then, Yu Zhengdu, who had originally been a bit embarra.s.sed about being held, performed a perfect fall, tripping directly into Shang Que\u2019s arms.He looked up and saw that Shang Que didn\u2019t appear unhappy at all. Thus, he decided to simply scoot closer to the other\u2019s chest. He said, \u201cXiao Shang, hurry and protect me. Whether or not I can return home in one piece tonight depends on you!\u201dShang Que suddenly smiled and made a noise of acknowledgment. The hand that had originally been delicately wrapped around the other\u2019s waist now tightened its hold.The two of them leaned against each other. In the noisy crowd, they seemed separated in their own world. Everything seemed to suddenly quiet down.Yu Zhengdu couldn\u2019t tell what he was feeling in this moment. He only lifted his head to continue looking forward.Under the guidance of the spirit lights, the thick smoke around the Gate of h.e.l.l dissipated, revealing the first figure.Only to see four short little creatures appear first. They carried a palanquin on their shoulders as they waddled out. The palanquin didn\u2019t have a roof. A stunningly gorgeous young woman with a great figure sat in it, slightly revealing her shoulders. Her expression was seductive as she leaned against the palanquin. Her gaze travelled across all the audience members; her thin and long eyes seemed capable of trapping people\u2019s souls. She immediately caused an uproar among the crowd.There were some slightly sleazier men who couldn\u2019t help themselves from shouting, \u201cBeauty\u2014\u2014look here\u2014\u2014\u201dAs expected, the beauty on the palanquin\u2019s lips quirked up in a smile. She lazily looked over in that direction. That area immediately erupted in screams and shouts. Those less civilized had even started yelling profanities. This caused all the other visitors to look over with displeasure. Some also couldn\u2019t help but furrow their brows\u2014\u2014this was supposed to be the Hundred Ghost Night Procession, so how come it was like this?But before they could express their suspicions, that beauty twisted from her waist and gently turned toward that group of people using improper language. That group of people became even more excited. They started furiously whistling. If not for the staff holding them back, they probably would\u2019ve directly lunged at her.In the next moment, though, they saw that beauty use both hands to press down on her temples. She used her fingertips to pinch at the edge of her skin. With a gentle tug, she lowered her hands slowly\u2014\u2014tearing the skin of her face, neck, and chest off just like that.Underneath the skin was a white skeleton covered with snakes, rodents, and insects.The first ghost to appear: painted skin ghost .Those sleazy men had been in the middle of whistling when they were faced with this sudden plot twist. All of their jaws dropped, unable to make another sound. Those who were less gutsy felt immediate nausea. Some even vomited on the spot, spraying the contents of their stomach over their friends.In comparison, it was those tourists who had been upset at their behavior who suddenly started cheering. Thunderous applause sounded out, both for this plot twist and also for this performance.Shang Que looked at the painted skin ghost who was first to appear, then looked at Yu Zhengdu. \u201cYour idea?\u201dYu Zhengdu nodded and laughed, quite pleased with himself. \u201cIn accordance to the original order, the first to appear should be lonely ghosts. But I felt that since the Hundred Ghost Night Procession is the climax of this event, we needed to be able to capture guests\u2019 attention immediately. Painted skin ghosts fulfill this requirement.\u201dShang Que nodded.Painted skin ghosts were a combination of human and ghost, beautiful and horrendous. This unexpected contrast truly made it easy to capture people\u2019s attention.Most importantly, due to the influence of movies, painted skin ghosts were very well-known among the general public. They were truly the A-list celebrities among ghost-kind.As expected, after the painted skin ghost\u2019s impressive performance, the visitors became completely excited.After the painted skin ghost, all other ghosts officially appeared.Only to see a large swarm of ghosts surging out. They were of all shapes and sizes, forms and colors. One couldn\u2019t exactly describe how terrifying or strange they were. Following the last wisps of smoke, in the cold, night air, they emerged in everyone\u2019s lines of sight.There were ones that looked like three year old children with red eyes, long ears, and bodies covered in a blackish-red. These ghosts could make enticing sounds and were called w.a.n.gliang ghosts .There were ones surrounded by fierce gusts of wind and large raindrops. They screamed and spat out purplish-black smoke. These were daolao ghosts .There were ones dressed in vibrant clothes, hair standing straight up like needles. These were messy hair ghosts .There were ones with two horns on their foreheads. They looked beautiful but cold, their gazes disdainful and uncaring as they scanned the tourists. These were dragon women.There were also qilangs , yakshas , rakshasas, birds with hurt souls , Dufujin G.o.ds , needle-mouthed hungry ghosts , eat-then-sleep ghosts , ghosts that lived in dirty alleyways\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026A hundred ghosts of a hundred different appearances. Some took large strides forward; some towed chains along; some wore strange clothing; some barely wore any clothing; some appeared jubilant, like they were finally able to leave h.e.l.l and see the mortal realm again; some had empty gazes, like they no longer belonged to the world of the living\u2026\u2026Those stories that once only existed in folklore, TV shows, movies, and art, were now appearing in front of them, one by one, group by group.The roar of a hundred ghosts, accompanied by gusts of Underworld wind and the howls, moans, and whimpers of h.e.l.l found its way into the ears of listeners.The term \u201ca hundred ghosts\u201d was naturally only a generalization. The Gate of h.e.l.l was open. The spirits pa.s.sing through it numbered over ten thousand. After those strangely shaped famous ghosts, more spirits of different forms floated by too. The long procession covered the Eight Underworld Mountain Views and the roads of the mortal realm.There were those holding onto money on the Rubbish Money Mountain, refusing to let go. There were those being chased around by evil dogs at the Evil Dog Village. There were also those struggling not to drown in the Bloodstained Pond.These were the multiple facets of the Underworld, but weren\u2019t they also the multiple facets of the mortal realm?The tourists were astounded by the appearance of the hundred ghosts, but were also touched by the varying scenes. There were also those still in a daze, lost in the procession they had just witnessed.The worlds of yin and yang, at this moment, were completely unified as one.Along the Troubled Water, lotus lanterns gently floated down the currents\u2026\u2026A hundred ghosts proudly made their way along the procession route, slowly disappearing from guests\u2019 lines of sight.But that scene became clearly engraved into each person\u2019s memories, forever.It also became engraved in Yu Zhengdu\u2019s heart. He watched the three little children and one young girl mixed in with the group, happily parading along, then silently glanced at Shang Que. \u201cThat appears to be Peppa, Guilong, and them\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que calmly answered, \u201cThey\u2019re ghosts too. It\u2019s not illegal for them to partic.i.p.ate in the procession.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026You\u2019re right!\u201dA drawn out voice sounded from the faraway void. \u201cThe Hundred Ghost Night Procession has officially ended. The garden party will continue to carry on until the Zhongyuan Festival officially ends. Tourists are welcome to move about freely. Please be careful and watch out for yourselves\u2026\u2026\u201dThe tourists recovered from the astonis.h.i.+ng performance. All of them excitedly huddled in groups to discuss the procession they had just witnessed and to upload pictures and videos to their Moments.For everyone, this was destined to be a sleepless night.For the people able to view their Moments, the revelry was only just starting.Gao Duidui had also only just managed to recover from his shock. He looked at the wildly increasing number of viewers and comments in his livestream and felt that his career path had already reached its climax at this moment.\u201cToo amazing, too amazing\u2014\u2014\u201d Now, he could only say these two words. But n.o.body in the livestream felt that he was being too stingy with his speech. On the contrary, everybody could understand his behavior.After all, the current comments were surprisingly simple too. They were all: f.u.c.k! Bada.s.s!Gao Duidui\u2019s heart was beating erratically. He couldn\u2019t help walking down the procession path once more. Now that the tourists had all left, he finally had a chance to walk to the front of the Gate of h.e.l.l. He held up his phone to get a detailed shot of the entire gate so that the audience members could get a better look at the place the hundred ghosts had erupted from.After he finished filming, all the visitors around him had basically left too. He was just about to head back when a deep \u201chuhu\u2014\u2014\u201d sound suddenly sounded by his ear.Gao Duidui felt confusion arise in his heart. He turned around to look, only to see something small suddenly hop out of the enormous Gate of h.e.l.l.A single backwards foot, covered in black hair, and owning a long, sharp mouth. It was alone and jumped out merrily.Gao Duidui immediately relayed in shock, \u201cAh, there\u2019s also a mandrill here.\u201dMandrills were also one of the hundred types of ghosts. They were quite common and easy to recognize. Thus, Gao Duidui managed to name it immediately.There had been too many ghosts in the Hundred Ghost Night Procession previously, so he couldn\u2019t remember if he had seen the mandrill among them. Could this possibly be one that got left behind?Gao Duidui felt curious, so stepped closer to get a better look. Coincidentally, that mandrill suddenly looked up too. In an instant, his blood red eyes stared straight at Gao Duidui. Gao Duidui jumped in fright.\u201cAaaah\u2014\u2014\u201d Gao Duidui was so scared he took several consecutive steps back. \u201cIt\u2019s real\u2014\u2014This is a real mandrill\u2014\u2014\u201d\u201cThis isn\u2019t a human in costume, nor is it a model\u2014\u2014It\u2019s real\u2014\u2014It\u2019s real\u2014\u2014\u201d Gao Duidui was in complete shock. Several thoughts suddenly flooded his mind.If this mandrill was real, then what about the hundred ghost procession previously???What about those realistic ghosts and monsters\u2026\u2026In that moment, Gao Duidui\u2019s worldview threatened to crumble.But instantly, a young man ran out from the Gate of h.e.l.l and lunged forward to grab the mandrill.\u201cRunning off again!\u201d Zheng Yan was about to start scolding the mandrill when he suddenly looked up to meet Gao Duidui\u2019s horrified gaze.Zheng Yan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dGao Duidui pointed at the mandrill in his hands. He stuttered out in panic, \u201cThat\u2019s a ghost, a ghost\u2014\u2014\u201dZheng Yan calmly stood up straight and held the mandrill up. He stated, \u201cYou\u2019re mistaken. This is a high-quality replication. It\u2019s a toy.\u201dGao Duidui: \u201c\u2026\u2026???\u201dGao Duidui\u2019s expression clearly read are you f.u.c.king with me . He said, \u201cIt it it, it clearly can move. It even glared at me\u2014\u2014\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s powered by electricity ah .\u201d Zheng Yan held the mandrill up in front of him and said, \u201cCome take a look if you don\u2019t believe me. It was only made to appear extra realistic.\u201dAs he said this, he squeezed the mandrill forcefully to signal that it should be more obedient.Mandrill: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dUnder Zheng Yan\u2019s ever so sincere gaze, Gao Duidui started doubting his own judgment. Finally, he got over the fear in his heart and slowly approached.Only to see the mandrill in Zheng Yan\u2019s grip remain immobile, as expected. Though it\u2019s red eyes were extremely terrifying, on second glance, they were truly blank and unspirited, almost as if they were made from plastic.\u201cIt really is only a replica toy?\u201d Gao Duidui exclaimed. He reached a hand out to squeeze the mandrill\u2019s arms and stomach. Desire was evident in his voice. \u201cIt\u2019s so realistic. Where did you buy it?\u201dZheng Yan\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change. \u201cThe factory has already gone out of business.\u201dGao Duidui felt great pity. He tugged at the mandrill\u2019s sole foot again and said, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t it moving anymore?\u201dZheng Yan: \u201cOh, it\u2019s out of batteries.\u201dMandrill: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dFeel wronged, but don\u2019t dare to move.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56 - Naive ChildrenPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 56 - Naive ChildrenWarning: attempted kidnapPeppa, Georgie, and the other two snuck into the crowd and joined the Hundred Ghost Night Procession. They were extremely happy, especially Peppa, because the human-headed turtle-bodied turtle spirit let her ride on her sh.e.l.l. That made Peppa\u2019s day.After the procession, Guilong felt like he hadn\u2019t had enough fun yet. Thus, he and Bei went to visit the bathrooms at the garden party. On the other hand, Peppa and Georgie felt like there were too many people around and that the bathrooms would definitely be stinky. They ruthlessly rejected their invitation; instead, Peppa and Georgie decided to go shopping in the ghost market.Peppa wasn\u2019t like the other broke ghosts. She had spending money given to her by her gege. She could be considered very rich among the ghosts.The two children held hands and headed in the direction of the ghost market. Because there were too many people, along with the fact that they were short, they were scared of being squished by all the pa.s.sersby. Consequently, after discussion, they decided to take the longer, less travelled way around.The two little ghosts chatted as they walked. Peppa said, \u201cGeorgie, when I get reincarnated, I\u2019m going to leave all my spending money to you. You\u2019ll be the heir to my inheritance.\u201dGeorgie thought about this very seriously. He asked in confusion, \u201cBut you\u2019re a ghost going for reincarnation. You\u2019re not dying. Is that still called an inheritance?\u201d\u201c \u2014\u2014\u201d Peppa was stumped by this question. She hesitated for a long time before saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Wait until I get back and check the encyclopedias gege burned me\u2026\u2026\u201dGeorgie nodded. \u201cOkay, tell me when you find an answer.\u201dPeppa: \u201c !\u201dWhile the two of them were happily chatting, they suddenly heard the faint sounds of struggle coming from nearby. Curiously, they turned around to look, only to see two large men towing a young woman into the darkness. The woman kept fighting back, but her mouth was completely covered. Only m.u.f.fled sounds could be heard.Peppa tilted her head and asked, \u201cWhat are you guys doing?\u201dThe two men in the middle of their crime were surprised by this sudden voice. But when they turned around to look, they only saw two tiny children.They scanned their surroundings in a panic. However, there didn\u2019t seem to be any adults accompanying the children. Thus, they exchanged glances. One of the men switched to a friendly demeanor and asked cheerily, \u201cKiddo, how come you\u2019re out so late? Where are your parents?\u201dPeppa answered, \u201cWe don\u2019t have parents.\u201dThe woman getting kidnapped finally saw someone appear; hope had just started to rise in her heart, but upon seeing that the newcomers were two children, she became more panicked than before. Who would\u2019ve thought that these two little children weren\u2019t cautious at all. They actually naively told the bad guys the truth. She immediately felt her vision go black. Her hope turned into despair.Of these two men, one\u2019s nickname was Society Rong while the other\u2019s was Lao Hei. Both of them were irresponsible thugs. They were also the people hired to cause trouble by the factory Gao Duidui had originally wanted to livestream at.The two of them had been messing around in the old factory as usual. After their job, they realized that it was still early and had also heard about the nearby Ghost Festival garden party, so had come over to take a look.The quality and effect of the garden party were surprisingly good. But in the eyes of these two, the good wasn\u2019t restricted to only the garden party itself. It also included the enormous amount of people at the garden party. This event was open till very late. Anyone could imagine how many young women would be making their way home in the dark.These two were habitual offenders. They were very experienced and located a small alleyway n.o.body else had noticed before hiding away. As expected, they managed to catch a woman who was by herself.They were on the brink of success, but suddenly, two children appeared out of nowhere. Originally, they were scared that these children would ruin their plan. After all, they had a limited number of people. Capturing an adult and two children was truly a bit difficult.Unexpectedly, these two children seemed strangely innocent and naive. They didn\u2019t appear to be guarded at all.Society Rong and Lao Hei exchanged glances. Both could see the astonished joy in the other\u2019s gaze. Society Rong bent over and scooted closer to the two children. Upon doing so, he realized that these two kids were extremely good looking. Especially the little girl, with her round eyes and face. Her appearance immediately caused people to like her.She could definitely be sold for a high price!Society Rong was ecstatic. Even his sleazy smile seemed a bit more sincere. \u201cKiddos, it\u2019s very dangerous staying out so late. How about gege take you home?\u201dPeppa and Georgie exchanged glances. Georgie said, \u201c , very dangerous.\u201dPeppa nodded in agreement. She very seriously told the two men, \u201cBig gege, it\u2019s very dangerous for you two to be out so late.\u201dSociety Rong: \u201c\u2026\u2026???\u201dFor a moment, he couldn\u2019t understand the child\u2019s logic. Lao Hei didn\u2019t care though. He only thought that this was the usual indecipherable way children spoke. He eagerly replied, \u201cSince that\u2019s the case, how about you go home with gege. Gege has a car .\u201dPeppa was still thinking about it, but Georgie had already raised his hands and said, \u201cOkay.\u201dPeppa could only a.s.sent too. \u201cOkay then.\u201dSociety Rong and Lao Hei hadn\u2019t thought that these two kids would be so easy to trick. Who knew what their families normally taught them. This was like simply throwing two young and fat sheep into the wilderness, allowing predators to do as they wished.That woman who had been caught hadn\u2019t expected for these two children to be so stupid either. She immediately started struggling even harder, trying to warn them to hurry and run.Lao Hei who was holding onto her was scared that she would ruin their plans. Thus, he directly elbowed her so that she pa.s.sed out. Then, he carried the woman while Society Rong herded the two children down a shortcut to the parking lot behind the shopping center. They had parked their van there.The developmental district wasn\u2019t crowded at all. It was the middle of the night, so the area behind the shopping center was very desolate. Currently, not another soul could be found.Society Rong and Lao Hei had never partic.i.p.ated in such a smooth and easy kidnapping. They only felt that the heavens were on their side as they opened the doors to the van. The kindness and patience they had faked the entire way over disappeared. Society Rong directly pushed the children into the van, then tossed the unconscious woman into the backseat.He grabbed the car keys and walked around to the driver\u2019s seat, then ordered Lao Hei, \u201cI\u2019ll drive. You tie them up.\u201dLao Hei nodded and got into the car too. He closed the door and revealed a twisted smile. \u201cKids, didn\u2019t your families tell you not to leave with strangers before?\u201dThe little boy shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201dThe little girl said, \u201cGege is only worried that strangers will leave with me.\u201dLao Hei had originally thought that his words would cause the two children to start crying, but he hadn\u2019t expected that not only did they not appear frightened in the slightest, they had even started speaking a bunch of gibberish instead.Thug Lao Hei couldn\u2019t help but lament in his heart:As he thought this, he fished out rope, tape, and other equipment from under the seat. He smiled and said, \u201cKiddo, gege is going to tie you guys up, okay?\u201dOnly to see the two little children exchange glances, then very cooperatively hold out both hands. \u201cOkay.\u201dLao Hei: ???????????If there were more families and children like these out in society, he would\u2019ve struck it rich long ago!Lao Hei couldn\u2019t believe that there really were such naive children. He familiarly tied them up, along with the woman, then taped their mouths shut with tape.After this, he was still in sight disbelief. He scratched his head and climbed into the pa.s.senger seat, then told Society Rong, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dSociety Rong started the engine. As soon as he pulled onto the street, he suddenly heard the little girl ask, \u201cBig gege, where are we going to go now?\u201dSociety Rong looked back reflexively and immediately was shocked out of his mind. The little girl was in the middle of using her wide eyes to stare at him, hands tightly gripping the back of his seat.She was very close. From such a short distance, those cute eyes somehow seemed a bit terrifying. They were very big and very deep, almost as if they were bottomless.\u201cf.u.c.k\u2014\u2014\u201d Society Rong was so frightened that he stepped on the brake, hard. He turned around and started yelling at Lao Hei, \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you to tie them up? What are you getting paid for?\u201dHow could Lao Hei not be scared too? He said in confusion, \u201cI tied them up\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is called \u2018tied up\u2019?\u201d Society Rong cussed as he parked the car and climbed into the back himself. He personally tied the two kids up with rope, all the while still humiliating Lao Hei. \u201cCan\u2019t even accomplish such a simple task. What a useless piece of s.h.i.+t!\u201dHe tied them up, but felt like this wasn\u2019t enough, so added another rope. After double checking, he finally climbed back into the driver\u2019s seat. Then, he started the engine while continuing to cuss Lao Hei out.Lao Hei got verbally abused, but didn\u2019t dare to refute the other at all. He was already lost in bewilderment and had started suspecting himself. Had he really not tied them up carefully just now?He really had no idea, so couldn\u2019t help but turn around to take another glance. This glance immediately caused him to be covered in cold sweat.Only to see that those two children still appeared as if they weren\u2019t tied up at all. They were in the back playing games with each other.\u201cRong ge, Rong ge\u2026\u2026\u201d Lao Hei finally realized that something was off. He used a shaky hand to tug at Society Rong.Society Rong was in the middle of driving. He impatiently shook the other off and scowled, \u201cWhat now?\u201dLao Hei\u2019s voice was already trembling. \u201cLook, look behind you?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s there to look at?\u201d Society Rong furrowed his brows, but still reflexively glanced in the rearview mirror. As soon as he did so, both of his eyes suddenly widened. He braked abruptly again. The two of their bodies instantly surged forward uncontrollably.But the children sitting in the back seat weren\u2019t affected at all. They were still happily clapping their hands together.Little girl: \u201cYou clap once, I clap once, a little child sits in a plane\u2026\u2026\u201dLittle boy: \u201cYou clap twice, I clap twice, two little children throw their handkerchiefs\u2026\u2026\u201dLittle girl: \u201cYou clap thrice, I clap thrice\u2026\u2026\u201dThe night was dark. The air was still. The two children\u2019s voices seemed strangely eerie and vacant. In the enclosed s.p.a.ce of the car, the noise echoed slowly.This made gooseb.u.mps appear on the two thugs who originally believed they feared nothing.Lao Hei\u2019s thinking couldn\u2019t help swerving into horror-related topics. He started shaking like a leaf. \u201cRong, Rong ge, what\u2019s going on?\u201dSociety Rong was slightly braver than Lao Hei. He toughened himself up and asked, \u201cHow did, did you two untie the rope?\u201dThe children stopped clapping. They turned around together and tilted their heads in sync.The little girl merrily asked, \u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201dSociety Rong: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOnly to see the little boy suddenly speak up creepily, \u201cI hate the feeling of being tied up.\u201dHe looked up at Society Rong. His big eyes were empty. \u201cIf your neck gets tied up, you\u2019ll die.\u201dAs he spoke, a rope covered in strange symbols slowly appeared on his neck. \u201cJust like this.\u201dSociety Rong had originally been feeling hopeful. But after seeing this rope appear out of nowhere, the last bit of hope in his heart disappeared and he felt the onset of a mental breakdown.But the little boy didn\u2019t care whether or not he was going to have a mental breakdown. He only said to himself, \u201cCan you see clearly\u2026\u2026\u201dThey watched as the rope slowly tightened, strangling him by the neck. Then, his originally pale face began turning green, followed by purple, followed by black. His expression started becoming more and more twisted too. \u201cLike this. You\u2019ll die\u2026\u2026\u201dA look of compa.s.sion appeared on the little girl\u2019s face. She comforted, \u201cLooks very suffocating.\u201dSociety Rong and Lao Hei felt like were about to suffocate. The two of them finally couldn\u2019t hold back their shrieks anymore. They howled as they tried to open the car doors, \u201cGhost\u2014\u2014there\u2019s a ghost\u2014\u2014\u201dBut for some reason, no matter how hard they tried to open the doors, they just would not open.At the same time, the little girl continued sharing her life story with the little boy, \u201cActually, I died very tragically too. Like this\u2026\u2026\u201dAs she spoke, she held up her tiny hand and slowly inserted it into her skull. Following her actions, bright red blood began incessantly surging outward, covering her young face. In the next moment, she forcefully pulled, directly yanking a piece of something out from her head. Even more terrifying, a part of her forehead was now missing.The little boy finally stopped squeezing his own neck. With an , he compa.s.sionately said, \u201cI can already tell how painful it was.\u201d\u201c ,\u201d the little girl nodded, then held the thing in her hand out to the front seat. She asked, \u201cBig gege, this is the top of my skull. Do you want to take a look?\u201dSociety Rong and Lao Hei: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThese two big geges who had been in society for thirty something years felt their vision go black. They had directly pa.s.sed out.Georgie seemed like he hadn\u2019t had enough fun yet. \u201cThey\u2019re very cowardly. They\u2019ve already pa.s.sed out.\u201dPeppa went and hurriedly pulled her scalp back. She guiltily asked, \u201cWhat to do? I think we\u2019ve gone too far. My gege is going to be angry!\u201dGeorgie thought about it. \u201cI have an idea!\u201dThe next morning, Yu Zhengdu received a news article recommendation as soon as he turned on his phone.Local headline: Unluckiest Kidnappers in History, Encountered Car Accident During Kidnapping, Directly Crashed into Police Station [click open for more]Yu Zhengdu clicked into it curiously and immediately became shocked by the ridiculousness of the content:Local headline: Last night, unemployed individuals nicknamed Society Rong and Lao Hei kidnapped a woman in the developmental district. Unfortunately, on their way back from the kidnapping, they encountered a car accident and directly crashed through the doors of the police station. They pa.s.sed out on the spot. While investigating the car, police found a kidnapped female in the backseat. Evidence and witnesses were both present. Unexpectedly, after the two kidnappers regained consciousness, they were adamant about the fact that they had encountered ghosts, even giving the police a detailed description of what had happened. After a thorough investigation, police determined that these two are the ones responsible for the previous hauntings at the factory in the developmental district\u2026\u2026Underneath the article, netizens\u2019 ruthless mocking could be found:\u3010What kind of stupid kidnappers are these? Why would you pa.s.s by the police station during a kidnapping?\u3011\u3010If they weren\u2019t stupid could they come up with the excuse of encountering ghosts after getting caught?\u3011\u3010Wait a minute, the hauntings at the factory in the developmental district are because of these two?\u3011\u3010\u2026\u2026Could this prove, that these two people are very in character?\u3011\u301023333 asking for a detailed account of how the kidnappers ran into ghosts. Want to know how detailed their description was\u3011The article writer seemed very interested in this bit too. He replied underneath this comment:\u3010According to a reliable source, the kidnappers tricked two ghost children. One had died from suffocation while the other could remove her scalp with her own hand\u3011Yu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAt the same time, Shang Que caught Peppa, who had come to find Guilong, outside his office. He cornered her against the wall and seriously said, \u201cPeppa, I know what you did within my enchantment borders last night.\u201dPeppa put her hands behind her back and stood up straight. She looked obedient as could be. \u201cGhost King gege, I didn\u2019t do it on purpose. The bad guys started it.\u201dShang Que coldly said, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter. You promised your gege before that you would tell him if you encountered any trouble. You\u2019re not allowed to do anything yourself.\u201dPeppa suddenly lifted her head. Her big eyes were filled with tears. She held up her face and sadly said, \u201cI\u2019ll never do it again. Can you not tell gege?\u201dHer voice was soft and sounded like she was about to start crying. She was really super pitiful. \u201cGhost King gege, you\u2019re the best\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que sighed and stated in exasperation, \u201cFine. Only this one time. There will be no next time.\u201dPeppa: !!The two of them reached an agreement. Shang Que thus held hands with her and walked out of the office. Who would\u2019ve thought that as soon as they walked out through the door, they would see Yu Zhengdu walking over solemnly. \u201cPeppa, what did you do last night?\u201dShang Que: !!!Shang Que immediately let go of Peppa\u2019s hand and very innocently stated, \u201cShe and Georgie caused two bad guys to pa.s.s out from fear, then dropped them off at the police station.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dPeppa: \u201c\u2026\u2026????\u201d<b>The author has something to say:</b>Shang Que: As long as Zhengdu looks at me, I\u2019ll tell all!Peppa: So angry I\u2019ve become a pig!Hehehehe, who said they wanted to kiss Peppa yesterday?

    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57 - The Desolate Luofeng MountainPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 57 - The Desolate Luofeng MountainLuofeng\u2019s garden party lasted all the way until the end of the Zhongyuan Festival. After Hai s.h.i.+ on the fifteenth day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar pa.s.sed, the hundred ghosts returned to h.e.l.l and the Ghost Festival officially ended.But in actuality, on the day of the Zhongyuan Festival, the garden party was filled with an overabundance of people.First, several people\u2019s interests were piqued due to all the pictures and related information posted and spread online by their friends. Later, Gao Duidui\u2019s livestream and dramatic encounter with a ghost went viral. Not only did Gao Duidui\u2019s livestream become instantly famous, it also caused several trending topics on Weibo.As such, even outside of Fu City, netizens all across the country learned that there was an interesting, unique, and astonis.h.i.+ng garden party. Consequently, starting on the morning of the second day, everyone who had time and could make it all rushed over to take a look. The most ridiculous were those who specially booked flights from out of town just to visit.In the end, Luofeng really had no other choice. They could only limit the number of attendees to the garden party and also increase the number of employees\u2026\u2026um, ghostly employees to maintain order.The netizens who had specially rushed over to attend the garden party naturally felt upset about getting blocked outside, but they had nothing to complain about. People on the internet had long since uncovered all the specifics about this garden party\u2014\u2014in honesty, this event shocked a lot of netizens. At first, people thought that a garden party on this scale and with such effects would most definitely be a commercial event organized by some corporate planning company. Some people even swore in their a.n.a.lyses that this was a professional theme park team and special effects team trying to make a name for themselves. But when the truth was revealed, it was actually an employee event organized by a local company in the developmental district.What else could netizens say? Besides calling \u201cfather\u201d with teary eyes, their only other choice was to vigorously cue the other theme park and special effects teams in the country to reveal themselves and get beat up.Another thing was that after a lot of netizens clicked into the trending topics, they noticed, wasn\u2019t this CEO and senior\u2019s company?CP fans went with the flow and cheered: CEO and senior are real! \u2026\u2026Though fans couldn\u2019t say what the company\u2019s garden party had to do with their relations.h.i.+p, that didn\u2019t matter. They were real either way!And then, Amazing Future\u2019s official account and Shang Que gained another group of fans.Of course, more people were shocked by the actual garden party itself. Several also strongly advocated for Luofeng to continue holding this garden party and turn it into an actual theme park, among other things.But back to reality. Those netizens not allowed inside because of the limited number of guests could only be upset on their own. This was the company\u2019s free, private event. It was already nice enough of them to open it up to the public. Limiting capacity was nothing. Even if they completely shut the event down and refused to allow any other attendees to enter, netizens wouldn\u2019t be able to say anything.But not all tourists were this mannerly. Some who were used to being unreasonable started making a fuss on the spot. They even caught the attention of the government body in the developmental district.Speaking of, the developmental district had been added to the developmental plan now for several years. Aside from in the technology park, they hadn\u2019t been able to attract any other big corporations at all. This was mainly because the location was too out of the way. Aside from those who worked here, normally n.o.body would visit for fun. The district had tried holding food festivals several times, but because these events were too common, they ultimately failed to increase popularity by much.Who would\u2019ve thought that a garden party hosted by one of the companies in the technology park would accidentally drive the flow of people in the developmental district through the roof.Disregarding the promotional effects and consequences of the garden party and simply considering the current situation, safety had to be emphasized. In the end, the government body in the district decided to specially send a team over to help maintain order. Finally, they got those making a fuss under control.These days, Amazing Future\u2019s employees also became crowd favorites in their friend circles. Under the conditions where the garden party had limited its attendee capacity, meaning several people who wanted to get in couldn\u2019t, Amazing Future\u2019s employees could use their employee identification badges to bring in five other individuals who didn\u2019t work at the company as they wished\u2014\u2014consequently, all of their company\u2019s employees, especially those programmers who weren\u2019t good with social interaction, reached the pinnacle of their social life on this day.During this time, some other ridiculous things also occurred. For example, after some people entered the garden party, they wanted to buy everything from all the vendors in the ghost market. Their actions caused other guests to protest greatly, even resulting in a small fight. In the end, after staff interrogated each of them, they found that these people were actually procurement merchants \u2026\u2026It turned out that after the garden party got onto the trending topics, several clever procurement merchants and scalpers noticed a business opportunity. They started posting online that they could help people out of town buy the products from the ghost market. The response to their posts was quite pa.s.sionate.Yu Zhengdu after learning of this news: ???????He opened the shopping app on his phone and searched for \u201cghost market\u201d\u2026\u2026 As expected, several procurement merchants\u2019 home pages popped up.Yu Zhengdu: \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026He then looked at the popular products for procurement. These mainly included miniature coffins, porcelain cinerary urns, etc. It was easy to tell that netizens these days were pretty uninhibited.Near the end of the Zhongyuan Festival, Luofeng\u2019s employees started clearing the venue. Though several guests still hadn\u2019t had enough fun and strongly advocated for an extension, Luofeng\u2019s att.i.tude was very resolute. The ghost market vendors and other staff simply packed up their equipment and left. Guests realized that this was an event organized for the company\u2019s own employees. It was reasonable for them to stop running the event as soon as time was up. With no other choice, everyone could only leave as well.Because of the kidnapping incident yesterday, Luofeng and the local government body placed a greater emphasis on safety. Though no one had actually ended up hurt, they still increased patrols around the garden party and nearby areas. As such, though there were a lot of people, after the two nights and one day the event lasted, things settled peacefully. This could be considered an example of a very successful large-scale event.It took all the way until midnight for all the guests to leave and all the ghosts to disappear. The teams maintaining order left too. The garden party that had been bustling for an entire day now returned to its peaceful state. Lights dimmed and the large, impressive works of architecture disappeared into the darkness. Looking into the distance like this gave one a slight feeling that they were having a sudden hallucination.The street lights blurred by fog gently swayed, making those buildings seem even more like they belonged to a different world.Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que stood nearby. They looked up at these scenes that usually only existed in books.Yu Zhengdu lamented, \u201cSo the Underworld of the past looked like this. It\u2019s quite interesting actually. I feel that I\u2019m not very scared of dying anymore.\u201d\u201cThis was only a small part of the Underworld,\u201d Shang Que said. \u201cThe Underworld was a vast area, just like the mortal world. It had its own mountains and canyons, lakes and rivers. It also had an abundance of unexplored lands. Only\u2026\u2026\u201dHe paused and didn\u2019t continue speaking. But Yu Zhengdu already knew what he meant.Just like those dynasties, tribes, cities, and legends that got overthrown and hidden in the long and tumultuous path of history. The deceased no longer existed. The living could only learn and guess at what they had been like through broken words and unfinished stories pa.s.sed down generation to generation.The Eight Underworld Mountain Views were only a corner of the Underworld. The Hundred Ghost Night Process also only represented things on a very small scale.\u201cSpeaking of, I\u2019m a bit curious,\u201d Yu Zhengdu suddenly said.Shang Que turned around to look at him. The confusion was evident in his eyes as he asked, \u201cWhat?\u201dYu Zhengdu gazed at the views faraway. Curiosity seeped into his voice. \u201cAren\u2019t you the Ghost King of Luofeng Mountain? How come you recreated the Eight Underworld Mountain Views but not Luofeng Mountain?\u201dIn honesty, Luofeng Mountain was also a famous mountain of the Underworld. Its fame in the mortal realm was much greater than the Eight Underworld Mountain Views. But strangely, as the Ghost King of Luofeng Mountain, Shang Que didn\u2019t include even a single trace of Luofeng Mountain in this recreation.After asking, Yu Zhengdu didn\u2019t receive a reply from Shang Que for a long time. He couldn\u2019t help turning over to glance at Shang Que, only to find that somehow, the other\u2019s face was filled with rare bewilderment.There seemed to be an indescribable emotion in those deep and black eyes.Yu Zhengdu very tactfully realized that he had probably brought up something he shouldn\u2019t have. He hurriedly added, \u201cIf it\u2019s inconvenient, you don\u2019t need to\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you want to see it?\u201d Shang Que didn\u2019t wait for him to finish speaking. He suddenly turned around to look at Yu Zhengdu. The emotion in his eyes had already been hidden away again. He once again looked completely unbothered. Upon seeing Yu Zhengdu blanking out, he repeated the question again, \u201cDo you want to see Luofeng Mountain?\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThankfully, Shang Que didn\u2019t make things difficult. He didn\u2019t keep asking for his opinion, only lifting a hand and gently tapping the air. As his long, thin finger swished past, the lights all around them instantly went out.Everything around them abruptly fell into endless darkness. In only an instant, Yu Zhengdu felt like he had been dropped into a thick and incredibly dense cloud. His surroundings were completely black. He couldn\u2019t see anything, and also felt a sharp gust of cold wind blow past. The wind snuck into his collar and sleeves, causing him to s.h.i.+ver uncontrollably.\u201cCold?\u201d A hand suddenly appeared from beside him and grabbed his palm. That hand was large, the fingers narrow and long with distinct joints. It gently covered Yu Zhengdu\u2019s hand. In an instant, that bone-piercing cold completely disappeared.Yu Zhengdu\u2019s heart immediately calmed down.Soon after, he saw lights suddenly appear in the overbearing darkness. Those lights were very far away, almost as if they were s.h.i.+ning from the end of the world.\u201cThose are spirit lights,\u201d Shang Que said.The spirit lights lit up one by one, slowly revealing a blurry shape.Only to see that on the horizon, under the glow of the spirit lights, a vast mountain ridge had appeared. The ridge disappeared into the clouds, connecting the sky and earth. It was continuous; at first sight, no end could be seen.\u201cThat\u2019s Luofeng Mountain,\u201d Shang Que\u2019s voice was light.\u201cIt\u2019s so impressive,\u201d Yu Zhengdu said. He honestly didn\u2019t know what to say. That mountain was truly too far away and it was truly too dark. He could only see an enormous form and those flickering spirit lights. As for what was on that mountain, he couldn\u2019t see that at all.Those spirit lights floated above the mountain ridge, forming a long path, almost like an invisible procession was carrying them. They climbed up the winding mountain path slowly and with great difficulty, until they reached the middle of the mountainside.Shortly after, the spot at the middle of the mountain became lit up too. Like the glow of fireflies amidst a dark sea, they slowly expanded. Eventually, they became a galaxy of stars.The collection of lights finally chased away the thick darkness. At last, Yu Zhengdu could catch a glimpse of the scene on the mountainside.Large city walls, continuous villages, moving horse carriages, and strangely shaped forms.The spirit lights floated among them, using their faint glow to reveal the shape of the city. Yet, one still couldn\u2019t see all the details.\u201cThat\u2019s the capital of Luofeng, the Ghost City.\u201d Shang Que\u2019s voice sounded like it was coming from far away. There was a hint of nostalgia in it. \u201cLuofeng Mountain is located in a place surrounded by extreme Underworld energy. The mountain holds down a hundred thousand evil ghosts. A hundred thousand Underworld spirits live in the Ghost City\u2026\u2026\u201dHis lips suddenly curled up into a faint smile. \u201cSince historic times, the best of the three realms all believed that Luofeng Mountain coalesced the strongest air of resentment between the heavens and earth. It would ultimately birth a calamity that could destroy everything.\u201dSomehow, when Yu Zhengdu heard this, he felt his heart drop. A thought flashed through his mind, but before he could make sense of it, he heard Shang Que continue, \u201cExcept, now it appears that the best of the three realms guessed wrong. The heavens and earth did not get destroyed by Luofeng Mountain\u2019s resentment. Instead, the mountain itself couldn\u2019t take it anymore and collapsed first.\u201dRidicule could be heard in his tone.But Yu Zhengdu couldn\u2019t say anything.He suddenly understood what that strange feeling hidden deep inside his heart was. Because a long time ago, while they were trying to save Peppa, they had had a big fight with the demon priest Jin Heguan.Back then, Jin Heguan had once said something. \u201cLuofeng Mountain already sank into the ground a thousand years ago. The Ghost King of Luofeng Mountain has long since\u2026\u2026Luofeng Mountain hadn\u2019t disappeared with the heavens. Instead, it had sunk a thousand years ago.But why?And the Ghost King of Luofeng Mountain. He had long since what?Yu Zhengdu wanted to ask, but didn\u2019t know how to. He was a bit uncertain as to whether or not Shang Que wanted to hear this question.\u201ch.e.l.l right now is very nice.\u201d A long time later, Yu Zhengdu finally spoke.Shang Que stared straight at him. Confusion was present in his eyes, almost as if he didn\u2019t understand why Yu Zhengdu was suddenly saying this.Yu Zhengdu looked over too, faint amus.e.m.e.nt in his gaze. \u201cJust like how the mortal realm will never stay in the past. No matter how strong or dazzling those dynasties recorded in history books were, we must still continue to walk forward. The Qin and Han were powerful, the Tang and Song were magnificent; these pieces of history are all impressive. For me though, I still like the current socialist society more, still like this era that has air conditioners, computers, and phones more\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI think that you\u2019re very nice. The way things are right now is very nice.\u201d Yu Zhengdu abruptly held up a fist and excitedly said, \u201cJiayou, Shang Xiaokui! Let\u2019s work hard for the rise of a socialist h.e.l.l!\u201dShang Que: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Shang Que suddenly laughed softly. He held up his right hand and gently tapped the air.Yu Zhengdu stared in the direction of his hand, only to see that the large and vast mountain off in the distance had disappeared along with the spirit lights.The thick darkness dissipated, revealing the realm they were currently located in: the street corner of Fu City\u2019s developmental district.It was currently the time in between night and dawn, when the sky was darkest.Their surroundings were completely deserted. Only a faint wind blew past, carrying with it the sound of cloth fluttering.The hazy street lights lit up this dark world, along with the scenery of the garden party nearby. It also lit up the eyes of the person beside him.Shang Que casually waved an arm and those unbroken structures, the ghost market, Bridge Over Troubled Water, Rubbish Money Mountain, Bloodstained Pond, Evil Dog Village\u2026\u2026one by one, bit by bit, they collapsed in the blink of an eye.They turned into dust. They turned into fantasy.Those mountains and cities were nothing but mirages.The plaza was still the original plaza. The empty land was still the original empty land.In this seemingly endless s.p.a.ce, it seemed that such a grand event had never occurred. Those memories from mere moments ago appeared to only be from a magnificent dream.\u201cEy, what a pity. Our company is too poor.\u201d Yu Zhengdu stuffed both hands into his pockets and lamented, \u201cOtherwise, we could buy a plot of land and hold the garden party every day. We\u2019d make a fortune off entry tickets alone!\u201dShang Que: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que tried to hold himself back, but ultimately couldn\u2019t. He bitterly said, \u201cJust earlier you said that h.e.l.l right now is very nice. But now you\u2019re disdainful at how poor our company is!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no conflict with that,\u201d Yu Zhengdu argued back logically. \u201cDoesn\u2019t this prove even more how responsible of an employee I am? Our company is so poor but I can still brag about it! Hurry and raise my wages!\u201dShang Que: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu gazed as Shang Que who was so depressed he remained silent and couldn\u2019t help the loud laughter that burst out. He patted the other\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cI\u2019m just kidding.\u201dShang Que thought about it before seriously stating, \u201cI\u2019ll raise your salary tomorrow.\u201dYu Zhengdu c.o.c.ked an eyebrow, then very sensibly latched onto the other\u2019s arm. \u201cBoss, you really are a good person!\u201dShang Que: !!!!The effects of the Ghost Festival garden party greatly exceeded Yu Zhengdu\u2019s original expectations. If in the past they had gained some recognition among netizens because of Shang Que\u2019s appearance, they had gone completely viral this time. As long as an individual spent time online, they had more or less heard of this extravaganza. This caused their product sales to increase tremendously as well.But the most unexpected were the companies who sought them out for collaboration after the event.The first were Zhao Ruola\u2019s friends, also known as the high-level administrators of other large companies. Initially, Zhao Ruola had been confused. But after asking for the reason, she suddenly didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry.It turned out that after seeing the garden party amidst the trending topics, the employees of almost all other companies felt extremely envious and jealous. They started subtly hinting to their companies\u2019 administrative departments that they hoped their own companies could put in a little more effort and hold a garden party on this level as well.Following the unwavering popularity of Luofeng\u2019s garden party online, these emotions started affecting everyone more and more. Rumors had even started that some employees at these companies had already secretly sent their resumes over to Amazing Future.On one hand, the administrative departments of all these companies couldn\u2019t deal with this phenomenon. On the other, they also truly did want to be able to host an event on such a scale.But after closely examining the videos and information online, they all came to the same conclusion: their company wasn\u2019t capable of this.Just from the technological skill necessary for this garden party, money wasn\u2019t enough of a solution.The employees obviously could tell this simple principle too. But that didn\u2019t stop the desire from itching at their hearts. Even if they couldn\u2019t completely replicate the garden party, it would still be nice to have one or two highlights from it. For example, the ghost market was the centerpoint of everyone\u2019s envy.Small companies had the aspiration but no abilities. However, big companies had more money and placed more of an emphasis on humane concerns and workplace culture. In addition to the fact that this garden party truly did catch a lot of attention, even several high-level administrators at these companies felt a bit of inclination.Thus, those that already had collaborations with Luofeng, along with Zhao Ruola\u2019s previous colleagues, managed to take action first. They asked which event organization company had planned the event.But who would\u2019ve thought that after asking, the answer was that Luofeng had planned and executed this entirely by themselves. Everyone was shocked that Luofeng had this kind of technology. Additionally, though, they felt quite embarra.s.sed. This was an event designed by the other company themselves. They definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to buy it even if they had money.Unexpectedly, after hearing her old friends\u2019 inquiries, Zhao Ruola only smiled faintly and said, \u201cNo, you can buy it if you have money.\u201dEveryone: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu and Shang Que who had also received Zhao Ruola\u2019s message: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dZhao Ruola noticed their silence and was extremely perplexed. \u201cI feel that accepting the event planning jobs for other big companies\u2019 internal events is a good opportunity. According to my previous work experience, the pay is fairly high. It can temporarily relieve the financial stress we\u2019re experiencing right now. Or are there some taboos that prevent us from doing this?\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026That\u2019s not it.\u201dShang Que: \u201c\u2026\u2026There aren\u2019t.\u201dIn outsiders\u2019 eyes, the most difficult parts of this event were the special effects and props. For Luofeng, however, these were actually the simplest. They came with the ghosts. If Luofeng accepted these jobs, all they needed to do was hire another group of ghostly employees who looked strange.What had shocked them was that Ms. Zhao, who had once been the number one female technological expert, had taken on the role of profiteer so quickly\u2026\u2026Obviously, this new vice president could already feel how poor their company was\u2026\u2026and had also very conscientiously added herself into the lineup of people trying to come up with more ways for their company to earn money.This truly caused onlookers to feel great grievance.The second person who got in contact was Wei Xiao. As Luofeng\u2019s earliest client, Wei Xiao had long since bought Luofeng\u2019s entire product set. But this time, he was here to discuss a new collaboration\u2014\u2014buying the IP for Luofeng\u2019s Ghost Festival garden party. He intended to develop it into a game.The company Double Horn Technology that Wei Xiao had founded was Fu City\u2019s largest gaming company and had once developed several extraordinarily popular games\u2014\u2014including some that Shang Que had been obsessed with. But following the rise of other gaming companies, in the past few years, the games Double Horn had released hadn\u2019t caused the impact they desired. Currently, they were mainly relying on their older games and reputation to survive. Several of the company\u2019s studios had failed to come up with plans that were eye catching enough. Wei Xiao couldn\u2019t help feeling a bit anxious.This time, he had unintentionally seen a video of Luofeng\u2019s Ghost Festival garden party online. It gave him an impression of being out of this world. Unfortunately, on the two days of the Ghost Festival, he had been out of town so hadn\u2019t been able to personally visit and experience it for himself. But even so, Wei Xiao quickly came up with this idea and immediately got in contact with Luofeng, saying that he wanted to work together.Wei Xiao\u2019s proposed collaboration received Shang Que\u2019s great approval. It instantly pa.s.sed.Yu Zhengdu: \u2026\u2026Ultimately, Yu Zhengdu still gave him a few suggestions. The collaboration would progress through authorized gainsharing. In other words, Luofeng would authorize Double Horn Technology to use the garden party IP without any upfront cost. But after the game\u2019s release to the public, they would receive shares of the profits.After Yu Zhengdu proposed this, Wei Xiao hesitated for a long time.Such a collaboration would have benefits and drawbacks for both parties. In Luofeng\u2019s case, if the game failed to be successfully developed, they would be unable to earn even a cent. But if the game became popular, they would be able to earn a continuous dividend.For Double Horn Technology, this could lower a certain amount of risk. For example, if the game failed to be successfully developed, they would at least be able to skip out on the IP purchasing fee.But Wei Xiao had personally come to discuss this collaboration. In actuality, this was exactly because he had high hopes for this IP. In his eyes, there was a very great chance that this game would be extremely successful. Thus, this gainsharing collaboration would be less beneficial for Double Horn.In the end, though, Wei Xiao still agreed. On one hand, he was determined to get this IP. To do so, he needed to make the necessary sacrifices. On the other hand, this was naturally because he had a very clear idea of the prowess of this company. He definitely didn\u2019t want to leave a bad impression because of a simple collaboration.Most importantly, during the entire discussion, Yu Zhengdu hadn\u2019t appeared willing to take a step back at all. Shang Que seemed more interested in the game than the collaboration. But the problem was, the whole time, his att.i.tude seemed to say that he was willing to listen to whatever decision Yu Zhengdu made\u2026\u2026which was very strange.Both parties were straightforward people. After confirming the method of collaboration, they didn\u2019t dwell too long on the other details, including the fact that Shang Que expressed a desire to personally partic.i.p.ate in the development of the game. Wei Xiao very agreeably consented to this.According to Wei Xiao\u2019s thought process, Shang Que could be considered one of the people who understood this IP the most. It was extremely fortunate for Double Horn Technology that he was willing to spend time on the game development.He just didn\u2019t know why Yu Zhengdu was maintaining a strange smile during the entire contract signing process.After they finished signing the contract, Yu Zhengdu shook hands with him and very politely said, \u201cBoss Wei, I\u2019ll have to ask you to be more forgiving in the future.\u201dWei Xiao: \u201c\u2026\u2026???\u201dFor a moment, he didn\u2019t really understand the meaning behind Yu Zhengdu\u2019s words.Only to see Shang Que excitedly and impatiently bring up his first suggestion for the game. \u201cI think this game can have a special soldier that has a 100% enemy kill-rate. Only one per server. As for the conditions to gain this character, I will design those\u2026\u2026\u201dWei Xiao: \u201c\u2026\u2026!!!!\u201d<b>The author has something to say:</b>Wei Xiao: This product master\u2019s profession has received a serious challenge today!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Building owner was lucky enough to visit the garden party before they started limiting entries. I thought that since I was there, I shouldn\u2019t leave empty-handed, but also didn\u2019t want coffins or cinerary urns. Because I had watched hangwoman jiejie\u2019s livestream the night before and because my grandfather likes calligraphy, I went to the 7th stall and bought a work of calligraphy for my grandfather. After receiving it, my grandfather really liked it. He kept praising that the calligraphy was exemplary.And then the hardcore thing happened. My grandfather is a member of the local calligraphy a.s.sociation. A few days ago, he took that work of calligraphy to the a.s.sociation for discussion. When he came back, he told me that he suspected the calligraphy was the work of a famed calligrapher\u2026\u2026Floor 1: ??????????Floor 2: ???? Truly, truly hardcore?Floor 3: Pft, floor owner hurry and explain clearlyFloor owner: It was just very unbelievable. Apparently it was a calligrapher who pa.s.sed away recently, only a year or two ago, named Wu Qiyi. Either way, people of our generation probably don\u2019t really know him. But they seemed very confident, discussing how soft or hard the lines were, a.n.a.lyzing the feeling the work gave them, etc. In the end, they concluded that this was a genuine work by that old Mr. Wu. Another member of the a.s.sociation even wanted to buy it from my grandfather at a high price. This made me almost suspect that the vendor had accidentally put a real work into the mix and sold it\u2026\u2026Floor 89: Suddenly can\u2019t understand this plot anymore?Floor 90: Wait, it can\u2019t possibly be real? Don\u2019t scare me, floor owner!Floor 91: Wow, floor owner has profited!Floor 92: Now that floor owner\u2019s mentioned it, I suddenly remember this too. Previously, I bought a mini coffin from a procurement merchant to be a backpack charm. At the time, I didn\u2019t think too much about it, but after floor owner said this, I suddenly\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Floor 93: Upstairs, in comparison to the material the coffin was made of, I think the you who has decided to use a coffin as a charm is more hardcoreFloor 94: So did floor owner sell it?Floor owner: What is everyone thinking? How could it be genuine???? I watched that vendor write it, okay? And I didn\u2019t sell it\u2026\u2026 I explained what happened to them clearly, after which they slightly calmed down. But they still got a professional to make sure. In the end, they confirmed that that piece of calligraphy was truly fresh. The ink hadn\u2019t even completely dried yet, how could it be the work of someone who had died several years ago? But they did say that the imitation quality was really high. That person probably imitated old Mr. Wu for several years. Now, they keep telling me to buy a few more works for them, because even though they\u2019re not genuine, this quality level is still worth collecting\u2026\u2026Floor 135: \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026This plot twistFloor 136: If that\u2019s the case, then it\u2019s truly hardcore. Let me get this straight: hangwoman jiejie said the vendor at the seventh stall was a famous calligrapher \u201cin life\u201d. Then, this vendor truly was able to imitate the work of an already deceased calligrapher, and the imitation quality is really high\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026emmm, the worldbuilding for this garden party is really very complete.Floor 137: f.u.c.k, then that\u2019s truly an immersive experience. A garden party without a single bug, too hardcore!!!!!!Floor 138: Am I the only one who finds it strange? It\u2019s only a garden party. Do they need to go to this extent? You guys haven\u2019t thought of any other possibilities?Floor 139: Upstairs I have the same thoughts as you\u2026\u2026 I feel a little terrified right nowFloor 140: Oh f.u.c.k, the ones before me, don\u2019t scare me . Can\u2019t it be possible that they\u2019re simply very diligent?Floor 141: Honestly, this technology and effect can\u2019t be accomplished by an unprofessional team. If this company isn\u2019t doing this for profit and purely as an event for their employees, it would be impossible to do things to this extent\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Floor 142: How come the ones before me are making this seem more and more realistic? Don\u2019t tell me that you guys want to say that the vendor really was the already deceased old Mr. Wu? Let me first perform \u201cbursting into laughter\u201d for you guysFloor 143: Plus one with upstairs. If that vendor was old Mr. Wu, then everyone in the ghost market really was a ghost, okayFloor 454: Those before me quit arguing. I got some inside info. Our company just notified us that for our employee event next month, they got the team from CEO\u2019s company to do event planning. They\u2019re going to replicate the ghost market at our company\u2026\u2026and it\u2019s not only our company. I heard that apparently, several large companies are all looking to collaborate with them.Floor 455: ????? A real f.u.c.king plot twist. So, CEO and them\u2019s technology is so amazing only because they have business in this regard, right????Floor 456: How amusing to see all the people upstairs arguing for so long. How come there are people who are so trusting?Floor 457: With that, everything can be explained. Since they\u2019re using it to earn money, it\u2019s necessary that they design each segment so intricately. But I still need to add on: they\u2019re truly very diligent, worth supporting!Floor 458: k2026;k2026; = = Reasonably suspect that the Ghost Festival garden party was only a test promotion!Floor 459: Wow, if that\u2019s the truth then I\u2019m happy. Praying online that our company can also invite them to plan an event!Floor 460: The ghost market can really be replicated? Aaah, I want to buy things!Floor 888: Everyone, hurry and go look at Amazing Future\u2019s official Weibo account!!!! They just released a ghost market shopping mini program called \u201cFengdu Ghost Market\u201d! You can buy products from the ghost market there!!!The Fengdu Ghost Market mini program was naturally developed by Yu Zhengdu. After the garden party, netizens had a great response to the products sold in the ghost market. The ghost market\u2019s vendors also received many benefits.After brief thought, Yu Zhengdu casually created a shopping mini program. The program was very simple: it only gave buyers a list of products and the option to purchase them.Because the Internet between the mortal realm and Underworld weren\u2019t connected, to actually operationalize transactions between the two realms, Luofeng was still needed to export the order details from one side and send it to the sellers on the other side. Thus, the backend systems for the two were actually separate. Luofeng was a necessary middleman in the whole process.There weren\u2019t that many products in the ghost market. The products were also strange, so sales wouldn\u2019t actually be that great. But for the sellers in the Underworld, though they wouldn\u2019t be earning much, they would still be earning money from the mortal realm. This money could be used to buy products from the mortal realm. Besides, the daily needs spirits had were all created from paper. After completing this currency exchange, they had surprisingly great purchasing power.Because the program was simple, Luofeng hadn\u2019t invested much into it. Thus, they also weren\u2019t planning on profiting from it; they only symbolically asked for some platform fees. The main purpose of this act was to try and help the people of the Underworld achieve wealthy and comfortable lives.Of course, the occasional issue couldn\u2019t be avoided.This day, Yu Zhengdu had just finished a meeting with the development department in their subsidiary company. He had his laptop in his arms and was heading over to Luofeng\u2019s office to report to Shang Que. But as he soon as he stepped into Luofeng\u2019s office, he saw an unfamiliar female ghost refusing to leave the side of the person in charge of the ghost market platform, Chen Yangli. She kept saying, \u201cPlease give me another chance. I will definitely be extremely, extremely careful in the future.\u201dChen Yangli was quite exasperated. Helplessly, he said, \u201cThat really isn\u2019t possible. Yours counts as a severe accident. We have rules, I can\u2019t help you either\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu sent Kang Jin a message asking what was going on out of curiosity.Kang Jin replied very quickly:\u3010This is someone who sells embroidered dresses on the Fengdu Ghost Market. Yesterday, a buyer in the mortal realm sent a complaint saying that the dresses she had received were made of paper\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026s.h.i.+pped the wrong products?\u3011Kang Jin:\u3010 , she s.h.i.+pped out her own clothes instead\u3011Kang Jin:\u3010It\u2019s a good thing the buyer didn\u2019t think anything of it. Otherwise, we\u2019d have to come up with an excuse to cover it up\u3011Yu Zhengdu understood. Business between the two realms was a big issue. There were several things to be cautious about and also to avoid. Thus, Luofeng was very strict towards the sellers in the Underworld. Sending things belonging to the Underworld to mortals was considered a level one error. It would be impossible for Luofeng to make exceptions in this regard.As expected, that female ghost still wanted to plead. Only to see Shang Que walk out. He calmly scanned her. \u201cDo you still want to reincarnate or not?\u201dFemale ghost: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d .Yu Zhengdu waved at Shang Que and smiled. \u201cBoss, what good timing. I was just about to go find you to give you a report.\u201dShang Que\u2019s expression immediately became better. He slowly strolled over, pulling up a chair along the way. Very elegantly, he took a seat. \u201cSpeak.\u201dYu Zhengdu turned his laptop around so that it was facing Shang Que. He clicked open a page. \u201cThis is what Erica and I were discussing. Currently, the development of our app is progressing very smoothly. Let me first talk about my section. She\u2019ll come find you to explain her section later\u2026\u2026\u201dAs he spoke, he pressed on another key, preparing to pull up his folder. But his hand slipped and he accidentally pulled up his search history.Yu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWith tense nerves, he quickly pressed on the \u201chide\u201d b.u.t.ton, then acted like nothing had happened and pulled up his own folder once again. He opened it and said, \u201cThese are the later plans for the backend system. We plan to collaborate with the app like this\u2026\u2026\u201dAs Yu Zhengdu spoke, he observed Shang Que\u2019s expression with his peripheral vision. He saw that the other was very diligently listening, like he hadn\u2019t been affected by the previous search history page whatsoever. He didn\u2019t know if Shang Que hadn\u2019t seen it at all or simply didn\u2019t care, but either way, he subtly released the breath of air he had been holding in.Shang Que finished listening to Yu Zhengdu\u2019s report calmly. As soon as he got back to his own office, he immediately looked outside the door. After confirming that no one was going to barge in to interrupt him, he finally turned on his own laptop slightly nervously and posted on a forum: I discovered that someone I know was looking me up online? After I caught him in the act he immediately hid the evidence, then sneakily observed my reaction! What does he mean?Though Yu Zhengdu had switched pages extremely quickly just now, he had still seen it all. Yu Zhengdu\u2019s entire search history was filled with: Ghost King of Luofeng Mountain!Shang Que nervously refreshed. Netizens didn\u2019t seem to be that interested in his question. There were only a few replies:Floor 1: Is the floor owner coming here to show off his love life?Floor 2: What else could he mean? He has a crush on you , next questionFloor 3: Hehe, burn this postShang Que: !!!Diyang\u2019s Qinglian Temple.As one of the most famous Daoist temples in the country, Qinglian Temple had always had an abundance of incense fire . But today, the number of people present was exceptionally high. Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que didn\u2019t arrive very late, but the ticket office had already stopped selling tickets. They only entered because the little Daoist Yuan Qing came out and personally walked them inside.Yu Zhengdu observed the ma.s.s of people. His entire being was shocked. \u201cYour incense fire is so plentiful?\u201d\u201cNo, no,\u201d Yuan Qing explained. \u201cToday is coincidentally also the day that my master is giving lessons. Several wors.h.i.+ppers have especially rushed over from out of the town to listen.\u201d\u201cOh oh.\u201d Yu Zhengdu understood now that he said that. Daoist priest Mu was an extremely famous enlightened Daoist. He probably rarely appeared in public normally. If he was giving lessons, it wouldn\u2019t be strange no matter how many people attended. No wonder Qinglian Temple had already started limiting visitors from so early in the morning.Yu Zhengdu smiled, \u201cHow rare for Daoist priest Mu to be giving lessons. Should we go support him?\u201d\u201cAy, there\u2019s no need,\u201d Yuan Qing said. \u201cThe contents of today\u2019s lesson are all the knowledge my master has gained from basic Marxist principles in connection to the field of scientific cultivation. Didn\u2019t you get a full score in your Marxist philosophy cla.s.s? You\u2019re probably even more educated in this regard than my master.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOff to the side, Shang Que nodded in agreement. \u201cZhengdu is very talented in the study of Daoism.\u201dYu Zhengdu couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cIs there a direct relations.h.i.+p between getting 100% in my Marxist philosophy cla.s.s and talent in Daoism?\u201dBefore Shang Que could answer, Yuan Qing had already b.u.t.ted in. \u201cOf course. These two both need a certain amount of philosophical thinking and an immense amount of mental energy. So, people who received 100% in Marxist philosophy shouldn\u2019t be that bad at Daoism.\u201dYu Zhengdu almost asked:But in the end, only the corners of his mouth twitched. He barely managed, \u201cDaoist priest, let us hurry and see the products.\u201d\u201cOh oh, right. This way, please.\u201d Yuan Qing finally remembered their formal business. He hurriedly led them to the back of the temple where guests weren\u2019t allowed. As they walked, he introduced to them, \u201cRight now, I usually still run my experiments in the factory in town. I only return to the temple when I need to practice Daoism. This used to be a storage room for our temple, but my master was worried that I wouldn\u2019t have anywhere to work in the temple. Thus, he specially a.s.signed an area to be my laboratory\u2026\u2026\u201dLaboratory\u2026\u2026Amidst a bunch of Qinglian Temple\u2019s decorated archways, gates, and various cla.s.sic architectural designs, Yu Zhengdu suddenly heard a modern location of \u201claboratory\u201d. He couldn\u2019t help feeling like this was all surreal.\u201cIt\u2019s right here.\u201d Yuan Qing stopped outside a large room. He reached a hand out and pulled out a keychain. As he did so, he spoke, \u201cEy, these keys are too troublesome. I\u2019m in the middle of recommending my master to switch all the locks in the temple to pa.s.sword locks or fingerprint scanners.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026Oh.\u201dYuan Qing opened the door. The group entered, only to see that the interior had already been redecorated. It contained several modern pieces of equipment and truly did look like a laboratory.There were several cardboard boxes lined up neatly in a corner. The same large words were printed on them: Qinglian Temple x Amazing Future.On a large table off to the side, there were also a few already opened boxes. Yuan Qing excitedly pulled out a square, white machine and handed it to Yu Zhengdu. \u201cThis is the Underworld energy purifier we developed.\u201dThis was it. Yu Zhengu and Shang Que had specially come to Diyang this time because the Underworld energy purifier co-created by Qinglian Temple and Amazing Future had finally been successfully developed and was now officially being produced.Back then, after deciding to develop the Underworld energy purifier, Luofeng had specifically gone to register their subsidiary company. They hired professional engineers to begin the development process with Yuan Qing. The engineers were in charge of solving the machine\u2019s mechanical issues while Yuan Qing was in charge of solving the Daoism related issues.This collaboration was only a test run. Neither Qinglian Temple nor Luofeng had their own factories. They also couldn\u2019t possibly fund a factory together. Thus, the two of them came up with a solution. In the end, they rented out a laboratory from an OEM and after successfully creating the product, directly outsourced the production to that OEM. This was also the fairly popular a.s.set-light model that several technological companies were using these days. It was very suitable for small start-ups.Amazing Future\u2019s engineers were all sent to work here as well. They only needed to periodically report what was going on to Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que.The machine component of the Underworld energy purifier mainly used the principles in a traditional air purifier. The contents weren\u2019t complex at all. The true difficulty during the development process was the Underworld energy filter element inside. After Yuan Qing solved this problem, they had pretty much successfully developed the product.\u201cWe completed over a hundred trials in the wilderness, empty graves, occupied cemeteries, haunted buildings, and places with bad fengshui. From these, we received an abundance of experimental data.\u201d As Yuan Qing spoke, he turned on a laptop next to him and pulled up a spreadsheet for Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que to look at. \u201cRight now, we have already successfully managed to maintain purifying effects in a stable and ideal range. Under normal circ.u.mstances, total purification can be completed within a 100 meter radius, which is definitely enough to satisfy the needs of a middle-cla.s.s family.\u201dYu Zhengdu looked over his experiment records. They were truly very detailed and scientific.Shang Que excitedly connected one of the machines to power. He turned it on to experience it, then gave the product a high degree of affirmation.Yu Zhengdu offhandedly asked, \u201cHow are sales now?\u201dBecause the purifier had been produced in a factory in Diyang, Qinglian Temple\u2019s wors.h.i.+ppers were the main target audience for this product. Thus, after production, the first s.h.i.+pment had been directly s.h.i.+pped to Qinglian Temple for an initial sales test. The quant.i.ty of purifiers in the second s.h.i.+pment would be decided based on the response in sales to the first.Only to see Yuan Qing\u2019s originally excited face collapse. \u201cWe produced five hundred in the first s.h.i.+pment. From the beginning of sales till now, it\u2019s been almost a week. In total, we\u2019ve sold\u2026\u2026two\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026Two?\u201dThough he had predicted poor sales from early on \u2013 after all, this product sounded a bit out of this world \u2013 because the average person probably wouldn\u2019t be so willing to accept it\u2026But only selling two among all of Qinglian Temple\u2019s wors.h.i.+ppers was a bit too tragic.Yuan Qing sighed and said, \u201cEveryone feels that the price for the purifier is too expensive. They\u2019re more willing to buy a few more Daoist charms to bring home.\u201dUpon hearing this, Yu Zhengdu understood. With the production cost of the purifiers, the ultimate price obviously wouldn\u2019t be in the same range as charms. Under the circ.u.mstances where n.o.body understood the effects of the product, it was normal for a majority of people to be disbelieving.He comforted, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Take things slowly. If it\u2019s a good product, people will be bound to appreciate it.\u201d\u201cI understand that.\u201d Yuan Qing glanced at the small mountain of cardboard boxes before him. He couldn\u2019t keep the defeat out of his voice, \u201cBut all the stock is still here right now. If we aren\u2019t able to earn back the developmental fees and production costs we invested in the beginning, I won\u2019t be able to start developing the second generation.\u201dYu Zhengdu sputtered, \u201c\u2026\u2026You\u2019re already starting to think about the second generation?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Yuan Qing nodded. The light instantly returned to his eyes. \u201cThe developmental process this time has inspired me greatly. I think that for our second generation, I can add in even more functions. For example, the levels of Underworld energy normally surpa.s.s normal bounds when one encounters something from the Underworld. If we can calculate the density of Underworld energy that different Underworld creatures bring along at different distances, we can add a notification function to the purifier that tells the consumer what they could\u2019ve possibly run into\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu didn\u2019t know how to start responding. \u201c\u2026\u2026I think that consumers might not want such a specific function.\u201dYuan Qing was confused. \u201cReally?\u201dThe corners of Yu Zhengdu\u2019s mouth twitched. He teased, \u201cYou\u2019d be better off adding a \u2018b.u.t.ton-to-call-the-cops\u2019 function. When the Underworld energy levels reach the level where one has possibly encountered an evil object, they can press a b.u.t.ton and immediately call the cops. We can also provide post-sales services for evil removal and ghost catching as well\u2026\u2026\u201dYuan Qing\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cMakes sense.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe had been making stuff up just now.<b>The author has something to say:</b>Yu Zhengdu: When Daoists become scientific, they are truly amazing!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59 - Purifier DebatePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 59 - Purifier DebateYu Zhengdu watched as Yuan Qing excitedly opened a new file and started recording his future development ideas. His entire being felt quite complex regarding this.It seemed like the little Daoist priest was truly going to continue walking down the path of turning cultivation scientific. Though this couldn\u2019t be considered something bad, Daoism and other modern technologies were ultimately different. Among the people, it had a very poignant image of being completely traditional.For example, the Underworld energy purifier Yuan Qing had finally successfully finished developing after much difficulty. Even though they were being sold in Qinglian Temple, a place that had an abundance of believers, people wouldn\u2019t necessarily trust them.Yu Zhengdu pondered how to sell off all these purifiers while starting to send messages on WeChat.Suddenly, a middle-aged Daoist wearing a grey robe rushed in in panic. With a hostile expression, he glanced at them, then angrily said, \u201cYuan Qing, why are you still here? There\u2019s trouble outside!\u201d\u201ch.e.l.lo s.h.i.+shu .\u201d Yuan Qing politely bowed toward him and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on outside?\u201dThe person who had arrived was Daoist priest Mu\u2019s s.h.i.+di . He was also an elder of Qinglian Temple whose name was Wu Yuping. He had entered Qinglian Temple quite early so was of high standing, but was only average at understanding the Dao. Normally, he was mainly in charge of taking care of the temple\u2019s temporal affairs. Thus, he was extremely displeased with people like Yuan Qing who were originally very talented but determined not to go down the formal path.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Wu Yuping explained in an implicating tone of voice, \u201cIsn\u2019t it all because of your purifier thing?\u201d\u201cAh? What happened with the purifier?\u201d There was a hint of bewilderment on Yuan Qing\u2019s face.\u201cWhat else? Naturally that the buyer isn\u2019t satisfied so has now come to make a scene.\u201d Wu Yuping was obviously quite displeased with Yuan Qing\u2019s experiment. Even in front of Yu Zhengdu and them, he spoke bluntly, \u201cYour brain is just muddled. Such good foundations but you refuse to obediently practice Daoism and decide instead to go down a strange and mistaken path. Saying stuff like you want to make the products of Daoism enter the households of thousands. And s.h.i.+xiong doesn\u2019t have his priorities straight, actually allowing you to act so foolishly. Now you\u2019ve done it. Trouble has come knocking\u2026\u2026\u201dWu Yuping was Yuan Qing\u2019s elder. If he wanted to criticize the other, Yuan Qing didn\u2019t dare to make any reb.u.t.tals. He could only hang his head and listen.But Shang Que was very impatient. He coldly cut the other off and said, \u201cDo you know how to get straight to the point? What is actually happening?\u201dOut of the blue, Wu Yuping got reb.u.t.ted. He had a bunch of criticisms left to say that got stuck in his chest, unable to come out. A moment later, he finally angrily pointed at Yuan Qing and said, \u201cThe Underworld energy purifier you sold to Grandma Gu a few days ago. Her family member has come here and caused a commotion, saying he wants a refund. Right now there are a bunch of wors.h.i.+ppers outside all waiting to see this joke.\u201dYuan Qing\u2019s expression collapsed. \u201cThat can\u2019t be?\u201d He had only sold two purifiers in total. And now someone was here to return one.This couldn\u2019t be described with the single word \u201ctragic\u201d anymore.The group of people hurriedly rushed to the front hall. Along the way, Yuan Qing appeared extremely anxious. Yu Zhengdu comforted him, \u201c Don\u2019t worry too much. I just looked over everything. There\u2019s nothing wrong with the product. We can resolve any other situation after getting the whole picture.\u201dWu Yuping followed beside them. Upon hearing this, he very rudely glared at Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que. \u201cSo you\u2019re the ones who tricked Yuan Qing into giving up on Daoism to go fiddle with those random things?\u201dYuan Qing hurriedly said, \u201cThat\u2019s not it. I wanted to study them myself\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mention your experiments anymore. To me, they\u2019re just jokes.\u201d Wu Yuping didn\u2019t wait for Yuan Qing to finish speaking before interrupting him impatiently. His tone was mocking, \u201cDoes anyone want those things? This is because you\u2019ve never heard what those wors.h.i.+ppers say about them. What high-tech purification and evil removal. You\u2019re just charging intelligence taxes.\u201dYuan Qing clearly knew about the poor response to his new product. After being scolded by Wu Yuping, his expression became a little embarra.s.sed too, but he refused to accept this and continued to explain, \u201cIt\u2019s inevitable that new products encounter setbacks and errors in their developmental process\u2026\u2026\u201dUpon hearing this, Wu Yuping became even more furious. \u201cDon\u2019t talk to me about your socialist Daoism. How utterly asinine\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThe little Daoist is right.\u201d Shang Que was too lazy to even look at Wu Yuping, but he complimented Yuan Qing. As a ghost king who had finished a professional MBA course, he had a certain understanding of market regularities now. He said, \u201cThe market needs to be fostered. There\u2019s no need to feel dismal because of a temporary setback.\u201d\u201cQuit using your words to fool people,\u201d Wu Yuping spoke up mockingly. \u201cIf you\u2019re so capable, clear out all the products in the storage first. I\u2019m going to be rude upfront: our temple has helped Yuan Qing sell them for seven days. We only sold two machines. Don\u2019t say I\u2019m purposefully making things difficult for you. It would even be okay if you guys could sell a dozen or so\u2026\u2026\u201dHalfway through his speech, he saw Yu Zhengdu lift his head and ask, \u201cYuan Qing, you guys can send packages from here, right?\u201dYuan Qing didn\u2019t understand why he was asking this, but still nodded in response. \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen wait for me to send a purchase order list to you later. s.h.i.+p out the products according to the addresses listed on there.\u201d Yu Zhengdu put his phone away and said, \u201cI just sold a little over two hundred purifiers.\u201dWu Yuping: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d .Yuan Qing\u2019s eyes widened too. \u201cSo many?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that many,\u201d Yu Zhengdu answered with a smile. Just now, he had casually sent the introduction of their new product to Luofeng\u2019s VIP customers. These people had disposable wealth; regardless of whether or not the product was effective, they would order without any hesitation just because of Luofeng\u2019s brand. \u201cThese are all test trials. Some clients said that if it\u2019s effective, they\u2019ll make a ma.s.s order at the end of the year as gifts.\u201dHe patted Yuan Qing\u2019s shoulder. \u201cSo, don\u2019t worry too much. Though we can\u2019t sell a large amount, it won\u2019t be that much pressure to clear out the storage.\u201dWith this, Yuan Qing finally became a bit more confident. \u201cOkay.\u201dWu Yuping: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe unwillingly hummed. \u201cBeing able to sell them isn\u2019t impressive. You must also be able to ensure that customers won\u2019t ask for a refund or try to cause trouble. I think that you guys should first resolve the issue with the person creating a ruckus outside.\u201dAs soon as Wu Yuping said this, Yu Zhengdu hurriedly glanced at Shang Que. He had already instinctively prepared himself to placate the other. According to Shang Que\u2019s strong desire for victory, it was very likely that he was about to start mocking the Daoist to his face.Only to see Shang Que merely chuckle and turn his head to lowly whisper to Yu Zhengdu, \u201cThe way he looks when he\u2019s unwilling to admit defeat is so hilarious.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWu Yuping off to the side: \u201c\u2026\u2026!!\u201dWhen they made it to the front hall, they saw a thirty-something man sitting in the middle of the room. His expression was angry and an Underworld energy purifier was next to his foot. Beside him, a young Daoist child was pouring him a cup of water.And outside the hall, a crowd was in the middle of pus.h.i.+ng their heads in to peer inside.When the Daoist child saw them, he immediately rushed over and softly explained the situation.This man was named Gu Hai. He lived near Qinglian Temple, so his mother Grandma Gu was a very faithful wors.h.i.+pper. Normally, she often came to Qinglian Temple to request for charms. She was also one of the only two people who had purchased an Underworld energy purifier.Personally, Gu Hai didn\u2019t really believe in these things. But previously, the old lady wasn\u2019t spending much on requesting charms. Thus, he allowed those spendings to slide. He hadn\u2019t expected that this time, Grandma Gu would get worse and spend thousands on some so-called \u201cUnderworld energy purifier\u201d. Gu Hai immediately couldn\u2019t accept this. In his eyes, there was no difference between this and tricking old people into buying health supplements. Consequently, as soon as he got a break, he brought this purifier to Qinglian Temple.Coincidentally, or rather, uncoincidentally, he arrived on the day of Daoist priest Mu\u2019s lecture. There was a ma.s.s of people in the temple. When he started causing a scene, he instantly attracted the attention of a mult.i.tude of people. Though the Daoist child invited him into the hall in a timely manner, the story had already gotten out. If this issue couldn\u2019t be properly resolved today, Qinglian Temple\u2019s reputation would probably be negatively impacted.Yuan Qing hadn\u2019t thought that selling an Underworld energy purifier would cause so much trouble. He hurriedly rushed into the hall and bowed to Gu Hai. He asked, \u201cThis householder, I\u2019m the developer of the Underworld energy purifier, Yuan Qing. I heard that you aren\u2019t satisfied with your purifier. May I ask what\u2019s wrong with it?\u201dGu Hai had already thrown a tantrum earlier. Now, he was calm. He only coldly stated, \u201cNothing. I want a refund.\u201dThat meant that he wasn\u2019t open to discussion.Yuan Qing was a bit exasperated. Refunding it was no big deal, but the problem was, there were so many people waiting for a result outside right now. If they didn\u2019t properly explain it as soon as possible, when the story got out, people would only believe that there was something wrong with Qinglian Temple\u2019s product.Instead, the current Yu Zhengdu could already calmly handle customers\u2019 problems. He immediately walked forward and smiled. \u201cSir, refunding won\u2019t be a problem, but shouldn\u2019t you at least give us a reason? This way, we can also make improvements.\u201dGu Hai suddenly saw a youth wearing a trench coat appear before him. The youth didn\u2019t look like he belonged at Qinglian Temple at all. Somewhat confused, he asked, \u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m an employee of Amazing Future.\u201d Yu Zhengdu handed him a business card. \u201cThe purifier is a product co-produced by our company and Qinglian Temple.\u201dGu Hai received the business card and took a look. After, he scoffed and said, \u201cI wondered why Qinglian Temple was suddenly selling these things. Turns out they\u2019re collaborating with a scamming company.\u201dYu Zhengdu had witnessed these situations quite often. His response was the textbook definition of calm. Not even the angle of his smile changed. Unbothered, he responded, \u201cSir, if you have any questions, I can explain the concepts behind the purifier to you. Please don\u2019t make such a.s.sumptions off the bat.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need you to explain any concepts to me.\u201d Gu Hai acted like he already knew how the trap would work. He kicked the purifier and said, \u201cI know exactly how you guys operate. You randomly have the machine display a few numbers that say that the Underworld energy levels are too high. A bit later, you lower the numbers and say that purification has succeeded.\u201dHe stood up and mocked, \u201cBut if you want to use this to earn money, at least make the product a bit more realistic. Shouldn\u2019t the numbers on it be slightly more plausible? Start selling them after they pa.s.s the quality test. Don\u2019t sell ones like the one you sold my mom. The number on the display has already surpa.s.sed the maximum purification capacity given on the instruction manual.\u201dAs soon as Gu Hai said this, Yuan Qing became completely lost. He reflexively stated, \u201cImpossible. I personally examined the purifier that we sold Grandma Gu. All functions were operating normally.\u201dBecause they had only sold two purifiers in total, Yuan Qing especially valued these two customers that he had attained through much difficulty. Before s.h.i.+pping the products out, he specially checked them over to ensure that there weren\u2019t any quality issues.\u201cQuit faking,\u201d Gu Hai sneered. \u201cThe number setting isn\u2019t the only thing wrong with this machine. Don\u2019t you guys also claim that this thing can purify Underworld energy? Then how come it\u2019s been at my home for several days but the energy levels haven\u2019t gone down a bit? Even my mom could tell that there was something wrong with your product. What a joke.\u201dGu Hai had originally only wanted to get his refund and leave, but after seeing Yuan Qing try to explain himself, he suddenly became angry again. He purposefully raised his voice while saying this, so that the people loitering outside the hall could also hear.Yuan Qing glanced over. Quite a few people outside were pointing fingers. He didn\u2019t know how much they had heard. He wanted to explain, but temporarily didn\u2019t even know what the problem was. Thus, he could only feel blatant anxiety.Wu Yuping was p.i.s.sed. He swung his sleeve but also feared that the situation would get even more out of hand. He rushed over and smiled ingratiatingly. \u201cMr. Gu, how about this. We\u2019ll refund you immediately\u2026\u2026\u201dOnly to hear Yu Zhengdu suddenly saying, \u201cMr. Gu, your situation might not be because something is wrong with our machine.\u201dGu Hai scoffed. \u201cThen what else could be causing it?\u201dYu Zhengdu looked at him and smiled. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019ve encountered a ghost.\u201dGu Hai: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dEveryone else: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dGu Hai almost lost his temper. But after changing his thought process, he started laughing instead. He purposely walked closer to the door. This attracted the attention of a large crowd of people. After, he raised his voice and said, \u201cYour temple is a little too hilarious. First, you scam old people into buying these useless things. Now, you\u2019ve been exposed but refused to admit your mistakes obediently. Instead, you\u2019ve created an excuse about how I\u2019ve encountered a ghost. Do you believe me when I say that I\u2019ll report you to the Consumers Protection a.s.sociation?\u201dAs soon as he said this, the crowd started muttering among themselves. Those who had witnessed the first half of the drama were very kindly explaining the situation to those beside them. Combined with Gu Hai\u2019s words, everyone\u2019s att.i.tudes suddenly became biased. Though they were all Qinglian Temple\u2019s wors.h.i.+ppers, they were against allowing Daoists to unrestrictedly earn money. In an instant, everyone\u2019s gazes became strange when they looked at Yuan Qing and them.Sweat formed on Wu Yuping\u2019s forehead out of agitation. He was about to step forward and persuade Gu Hai when Yu Zhengdu beat him to it. The other said, \u201cMr. Gu, in my opinion, we should go take a look around your house.\u201dBefore Gu Hai could refute him, Yu Zhengdu added, \u201cThis counts as free post-sale service. If it proves that there is actually something wrong with our machine, we will give you an unconditional refund and a public apology. No matter how you defame us in public, we\u2019ll admit it. What do you think?\u201dHonestly, Gu Hai was reluctant in his heart. It was too much trouble for them to examine his house just to return a product. But he was purposefully causing a commotion in front of so many people to make Qinglian Temple lose face. Yu Zhengdu\u2019s conditions were also so sincere. If he refused to agree, it would appear as if he was guilty and in the wrong instead.Gu Hai thought about it. Either way, his house wasn\u2019t far. A trip was only a trip. Later, he would be able to return with evidence to press Qinglian Temple into the ground and wipe the floor with them.Wu Yuping was about to go mad from rage. He stepped forward and started yelling, \u201cAre you crazy? You\u2019re joking with the reputation of Qinglian Temple\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu spoke, \u201cDaoist priest Wu, you think Qinglian Temple\u2019s reputation would be fine if we don\u2019t clearly explain the situation today?\u201dWu Yuping was rendered temporarily speechless. Truly. So many people had already witnessed everything. Unless they could prove that there was nothing wrong with the purifier, no matter how they tried to save their reputation, they wouldn\u2019t be able to remove this stain.But in the end, the real problem was that they shouldn\u2019t have produced that purifier thing.Wu Yuping\u2019s chest hurt due to his anger. On the other hand, Yu Zhengdu was very relaxed. He exchanged eye contact with Shang Que, then walked out with Yuan Qing and Gu Hai.They headed towards Qinglian Temple\u2019s exit. A few gossipy crowd members followed them part of the way. They discussed things quietly among themselves.\u201cThey\u2019re really going?\u201d\u201cThe situation has already gotten out of hand. They have no other choice but to go.\u201d\u201cSo after they finish examining it, will they come back and announce the results to everyone?\u201d\u201cHow would they do that? There\u2019s an 80% chance that won\u2019t happen. They\u2019re just trying to save face for each other.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Qinglian Temple. How could Daoist priest Mu allow the people below him to sell these things? Isn\u2019t that ruining his reputation too?\u201d\u201cEy, what\u2019s so strange about that. Haven\u2019t all Daoist temples started becoming more and more commercial lately.\u201d\u201cBut they can\u2019t be so horrible at it\u2026\u2026\u201dGu Hai took large strides up ahead. He didn\u2019t forget to vex Yu Zhengdu and them along the way. \u201cLet me give you a kind warning ahead of time. None of my family, relatives, friends, or coworkers have died recently. They haven\u2019t even had any accidents. I haven\u2019t gone anywhere haunted and the house we live in has been the same one we\u2019ve occupied for the past few decades. It can\u2019t possibly be a haunted house. We also never bring anything random into the house from outside. That\u2019s the situation. Careful with what excuses you plan to make in the future. I\u2019m interested in seeing what new, interesting lies you guys can come up with\u2026\u2026\u201dIt seemed like Gu Hai had truly done his homework before coming to return the product. He had already eliminated all the usual possibilities of encountering evil known among the general public.After he said this, even Yuan Qing became a bit nervous. He softly asked Yu Zhengdu, \u201cIt\u2019s very unlikely that he\u2019s encountered anything evil with his situation. Could it be that there really is something wrong with our machine?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Yu Zhengdu patted his shoulder, but he also felt a bit hesitant in his heart. He lowly asked Shang Que, \u201cWhat\u2019s the situation with this person? Could it be that he really hasn\u2019t encountered a ghost?\u201dShang Que was completely unbothered. \u201cWho cares. Either way, he\u2019s definitely going to encounter a ghost today.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026Promise me. Whatever you do, you won\u2019t act personally.\u201dShang Que looked at him. Suddenly, he crooked his lips into a barely noticeable smile. \u201cOkay. I promise you.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u2026\u2026Gu Hai was still incessantly mocking them, \u201cDo you guys have any other circ.u.mstances where one would encounter a ghost? Share them with me so I can give you a consultation. Otherwise, it would be too awkward if you made something up and it didn\u2019t match with the general conditions at my house\u2026\u2026\u201dBy now, they were already by Qinglian Temple\u2019s gate. As Gu Hai spoke, he stepped outside the gate, then saw Yu Zhengdu suddenly stop walking. The other said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need. We already know what\u2019s going on?\u201dGu Hai\u2019s footsteps paused. He thought that his mocking had allowed them to recognize the difficulty and surrender. He couldn\u2019t keep the disdain out of his tone. \u201cWhat, giving up so quickly? Or is it that you can\u2019t come up with any other excuses?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not it, Mr. Gu. We already know what evil you\u2019ve encountered.\u201d Yu Zhengdu stared at the spot by the other\u2019s foot and asked, \u201cMay I ask if you\u2019re familiar with a yellow dog?\u201dUpon hearing this, Gu Hai furrowed his brows. He inquired in confusion, \u201cA what dog?\u201dYu Zhengdu kept staring at the spot by his foot. He spread his arms apart and gestured, \u201cA yellow mutt, about this big. It has a white spot on its right leg and there\u2019s a piece missing from its left ear\u2026\u2026\u201dFollowing his description, a disbelieving expression slowly crept onto Gu Hai\u2019s face. When Yu Zhengdu started talking about the ear, he finally couldn\u2019t help charging forward and grabbing onto the other\u2019s wrist. \u201cThat\u2019s Meichao ! You\u2019ve seen Meichao! Where is it ?\u201dShang Que reached a hand out from the side and pried the other\u2019s hand off. He coldly said, \u201cAmerican banknotes are in the bank. Keep your hands to yourself.\u201dA hint of embarra.s.sment flashed across Gu Hai\u2019s face, but he still couldn\u2019t hide his excitement. His originally arrogant att.i.tude completely disappeared too. He said, \u201cMeichao was a rural dog I used to keep. It suddenly disappeared two months ago. I searched for a long time but couldn\u2019t find it. May I ask where you guys saw it? Can you take me to go find it?\u201dYu Zhengdu sighed. His eyes remained glued to the spot by Gu Hai\u2019s foot. \u201cIt\u2019s right by your side.\u201dJust now, Gu Hai had stepped out of Qinglian Temple\u2019s gates. Immediately, the spirit of a large, yellow dog had pounced over and started walking in circles around his feet.According to this situation, it seemed that for this period of time, this dog had been staying by Gu Hai\u2019s side. No wonder the Underworld energy levels on the purifier wouldn\u2019t decrease no matter what.But the temple was protected by the power of the G.o.ds and the faith of the wors.h.i.+ppers. Evil and Underworld spirits couldn\u2019t enter. Thus, when Gu Hai walked into Qinglian Temple, the big dog could only stand guard outside and wait for him.At this time, the big dog seemed to discover that Yu Zhengdu could see it. It leaned its head back and started whimpering at him nonstop.Yu Zhengdu squatted in front of the big dog. His gaze was filled with pity. \u201cIt\u2019s very old already.\u201dIf at first Gu Hai had still been a bit suspicious, he finally couldn\u2019t keep the tears back after hearing this. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Meichao is already very old. It\u2019s a little directionally challenged now, which is why it probably got lost\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt didn\u2019t get lost.\u201d Shang Que stared at the big dog and calmly relayed, \u201cIt ran off on its own.\u201d\u201cRan off on its own?\u201d Gu Hai paused. He asked in confusion, \u201cImpossible. Meichao accompanied me for so many years. It wouldn\u2019t bear to leave me\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que: \u201cIt had to bear to even if it couldn\u2019t bear to. It reached the end of its life.\u201dGu Hai was speechless. Suddenly, he understood everything.He had raised Meichao for several years. Naturally, he knew dogs\u2019 habits. Several loyal dogs would choose to leave their owners near the end of their lives because they didn\u2019t want their owners to witness their pa.s.sing.But he hadn\u2019t expected that Meichao\u2019s affections towards its owner would be so deep. Prior to death, it had avoided Gu Hai. After death, its spirit stayed by his side, guarding him, just as it had in life. It refused to leave.Gu Hai couldn\u2019t help the tears pouring down his face anymore. \u201cMeichao, Meichao\u2014\u2014\u201dThe big dog: \u201cWu\u2014\u2014\u201dInside Qinglian Temple, Daoist priest Mu just finished his lecture. As he exited the main hall with the flow of people, Wu Yuping hurriedly made his way to the other\u2019s side and impatiently tugged him into a corner. He relayed what had just happened and in extreme agony stated, 's.h.i.+xiong, you can\u2019t allow Yuan Qing to continue fooling around like this. Otherwise, our Qinglian Temple\u2019s reputation is going to become ruined sooner or later\u2026\u2026\u201dDaoist priest Mu also hadn\u2019t expected that a purifier would be able to cause so much trouble. He pondered a bit and said, \u201cLittle Householder Yu\u2019s company is very professional. Perhaps there\u2019s been a misunderstanding with the client. We should wait and see\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy do you still trust those two people? They\u2019re just silver-tongued scammers!\u201d Wu Yuping was almost beside himself with worry. 's.h.i.+xiong, you didn\u2019t see how that Householder Gu caused a commotion just now. He directly ripped our face away. If you don\u2019t act quickly now, when Householder Gu comes back, we won\u2019t be able to control the situation anymore!\u201dDaoist priest Mu was shocked. \u201cIt\u2019s really so serious?\u201dWu Yuping got straight to the point. \u201cIt\u2019s much more serious than that. If you don\u2019t believe me, look at the wors.h.i.+ppers outside. Aren\u2019t they pointing fingers at us?\u201dDaoist priest Mu glanced outside. As expected, there was a group of wors.h.i.+ppers making their way over. They surrounded them and started whispering among each other. He could make out words like \u201cpurifier\u201d and \u201cis that real or fake\u201d. All of their expressions were surprised and confused.Wu Yuping appeared both anxious and smug. He held his hands out: 's.h.i.+xiong, see!\u201dDaoist priest Mu\u2019s expression darkened. In his heart, he was biased towards Yu Zhengdu, Yuan Qing, and them. But this matter was related to Qinglian Temple\u2019s reputation. It was no longer a question of right or wrong.Just as he was in the middle of a fierce debate with himself, the incessantly chattering wors.h.i.+ppers outside suddenly split into two groups and cleared a small path in the middle. Then, he saw Yuan Qing leading Gu Hai over. Gu Hai couldn\u2019t stop saying, \u201cDaoist priest Yuan Qing, please promise me that you will arrange for the best soul releasing ceremony for Meichao\u2026\u2026\u201dYuan Qing nodded. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, my master\u2019s cultivation level is very great\u2026\u2026\u201dGu Hai looked up after giving his instructions. As soon as he saw Daoist priest Mu, he immediately became overjoyed. He shouted, \u201cDaoist priest Mu, you\u2019ve finished lecturing? That\u2019s great!\u201dUpon seeing this, Wu Yuping\u2019s entire body tensed. As if facing a great enemy, he said, 's.h.i.+xiong, this is that Householder Gu.\u201dDaoist priest Mu\u2019s expression became severe. He hurriedly rushed forward and said, \u201cHouseholder Gu, you mustn\u2019t be agitated. We can have a civilized discussion about the purifier\u2026\u2026\u201dGu Hai immediately cut him off, \u201cNo no no, there\u2019s no need for discussion.\u201dWu Yuping instantly became even more nervous. \u201cWhat do you actually want?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want anything\u2026\u2026\u201d Gu Hai\u2019s expression appeared a bit awkward, but his att.i.tude while apologizing was more than pa.s.sable. He politely bowed and said, \u201cDaoist priest Mu, the purifier you guys are selling is too great. As expected from high tech. I\u2019m not going to return the original one anymore, and also I want to buy another one as a gift.\u201dDaoist priest Mu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dDaoist priest Mu turned around and looked at Wu Yuping in perplexion.Wu Yuping: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d<b>The author has something to say:</b>Daoist priest Mu: I knew it. Scientific Daoism can\u2019t go wrong!Zhengdu: How come Boss has been so agreeable these past few days?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60 - Buying Stock in the Amusement ParkPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 60 - Buying Stock in the Amus.e.m.e.nt ParkGu Hai\u2019s sudden change in att.i.tude not only shocked Wu Yuping, but also confused all those wors.h.i.+ppers who were originally waiting to watch the drama unfold.Fortunately, there were people in the crowd who were familiar with the Daoists in the temple. After asking each other about the situation, they finally got a general sense of what had unfolded.It turned out that Gu Hai\u2019s mother, Grandmother Gu, had been persuaded to buy the Underworld energy purifier because she had felt something off at home. The old lady was normally very devout, so was more sensitive in this regard than normal people. But she hadn\u2019t expected to accidentally discover such an occurrence.Grandmother Gu was a familiar face at Qinglian Temple; she was friends with several wors.h.i.+ppers who visited often. She had a pretty good reputation too. After the situation with her family got out, a good number of people actually believed it. Coincidentally, there were a lot of wors.h.i.+ppers present for this lecture. Many had come from out of town too. Everyone spoke to one another, eventually spreading the story completely. Those with the financial means pondered a bit, then decided to join in the trend and buy a purifier to bring home.There weren\u2019t many purifiers left in the first production stock either. In addition to the sales to Luofeng\u2019s VIP customers, in an instant, they had already sold most of the machines.Of course, the majority of people were still suspicious, but following the spread of positive feedback from the first group of customers, the market for purifiers naturally started growing.Currently, Gu Hai was in the middle of sincerely apologizing to Qinglian Temple. He also earnestly requested for Daoist priest Mu to perform a soul releasing ceremony for Meichao. The entire situation could be considered a strange kind of destiny. After brief thought, Daoist priest Mu agreed.Gu Hai was incredibly grateful that he was able to successfully get Daoist priest Mu to perform the ceremony. After agreeing, Daoist priest Mu and them got surrounded by the other guests. Thus, Gu Hai started apologizing profusely to Wu Yuping.Gu Hai: \u201cDaoist priest Wu, I\u2019m truly apologetic about just now. Please don\u2019t be angry with me.\u201dWu Yuping: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dGu Hai: \u201cI truly hadn\u2019t thought that Underworld energy could be purified with a machine. As expected, Qinglian Temple is a big temple. Even your technological advancements are further ahead than other Daoists. Daoist priest Wu, I express my greatest respect for you guys.\u201dWu Yuping: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter speaking for a long time, Gu Hai still didn\u2019t get a response from Wu Yuping. He wondered if the other was still mad at him, so carefully asked, \u201cDaoist priest Wu, how come you aren\u2019t speaking? Did I say something wrong?\u201d\u201cNo, no.\u201d Wu Yuping\u2019s expression was very dazed. He patted Gu Hai\u2019s shoulder and stumbled away. As he walked, he muttered, \u201cI was the one who was wrong. There are still many subjects I need to learn\u2026\u2026\u201dGu Hai gazed at Wu Yuping\u2019s desolate figure and sincerely praised, \u201cAs expected from the temple that is at the forefront of technology. Daoist priest Wu is so humble.\u201dAfter solving Gu Hai\u2019s issue, Daoist priest Mu politely led Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que to the side hall where they received guests. It turned out that there had been an important guest waiting there earlier, but it was someone everyone was familiar with: the CEO of Excellent Jade Corporation, Yang Xin.Yang Xin was also Luofeng\u2019s VIP customer. But Luofeng only sold products; they didn\u2019t deal in spell casting or anything else. Thus, whenever Yang Xin encountered trouble, he would still seek out Daoist priest Mu.Upon seeing Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que, Yang Xin looked pleasantly surprised. He hurriedly rushed forward and shook their hands. \u201cBoss Shang, Little Boss Yu, what a coincidence. You guys are here too?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s truly a coincidence,\u201d Yu Zhengdu greeted Yang Xin. \u201cWe\u2019re here to see the new product.\u201dYang Xin: \u201cNew product?\u201dYu Zhengdu nodded. \u201cThe Underworld energy purifier being co-produced by our company and Qinglian Temple.\u201dBack then, when he had suggested the idea of developing an Underworld energy purifier, Yang Xin had been present too. Yu Zhengdu didn\u2019t need to explain further.\u201cAh, has that been successfully developed?\u201d Yang Xin asked in surprise. He had only rushed to Diyang from out of town this morning, so hadn\u2019t heard the news yet. Upon hearing it now, he pretended to act displeased. \u201cYou should\u2019ve told me before anyone else.\u201d\u201cToo late for that,\u201d Yu Zhengdu smiled. \u201cBut if you order now, you can still try to be one of the first people to receive the product.\u201d\u201cThat works too,\u201d Yang Xin laughed. After a short pause, he said, \u201cThen give me fifty.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dEveryone else: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu asked in shock, \u201cWhy do you want so many?\u201d\u201cI have many houses,\u201d Yang Xin responded naturally. \u201cI have houses in all the big cities in the country, and also have several apartments. Besides, my houses are very large. I probably need at least two or three machines per house?\u201d\u201cOkay, got it,\u201d Yu Zhengdu interrupted him expressionlessly. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to go into so much detail.\u201dOff to the side, Yuan Qing used his phone to check on the current sales situation. He regretfully said, \u201cHouseholder Yang, we just sold most of our purifiers. Currently, we only have thirteen left in stock.\u201d\u201cHow about this \u2013 that\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll just take them all first.\u201d Yang Xin waved his hand carefreely. His tone was a bit sorrowful, \u201cThere\u2019s no other choice. The houses I rarely live in will have to go without them for now.\u201dYu Zhengdu pressed a hand against his chest. He felt a huge sense of imbalance in his heart. After brief thought, he silently pulled out his phone and sent a message to the customer service department:\u3010Increase the service fee for VIP customer Yang Xin tenfold!\u3011Very quickly, Shang Que\u2019s message appeared too:\u3010Agree.\u3011Yu Zhengdu lifted his head to glance at Shang Que, only to see Shang Que elegantly sitting with his chin on his hand. No one could tell at all that he was in the middle of being angry because of others\u2019 wealth.Yang Xin was completely clueless about the fact that his fees had been secretly raised. He casually bought out the rest of the Underworld energy purifiers, then eagerly looked at Daoist priest Mu. \u201cDaoist priest Mu, about the situation I explained before. Do you have any suggestions to help me resolve it?\u201dDaoist priest Mu answered apologetically, \u201cThe situation you mentioned is not related to evil spirits or demons. There is truly nothing I can do about it.\u201dYang Xin sighed heavily. His tone was depressed, \u201cI actually know that too. I was just asking casually. There was always a chance.\u201dDaoist priest Mu looked like he didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. \u201cWhat chance could there be? Business is always a game of human wits. Even ghosts or G.o.ds are incapable of changing anything.\u201dBeside them, Yu Zhengdu was completely lost. Consequently, he asked curiously, \u201cHas Boss Yang encountered trouble?\u201d\u201cBig trouble.\u201d Yang Xin\u2019s expression immediately became pained. He completely lost the high-spirited and daring energy he had when buying the purifiers just now and said, \u201cDo you remember the Feiyu Amus.e.m.e.nt Park our company was building in Chuandong?\u201dYu Zhengdu nodded. He naturally remembered.Excellent Jade Corporation had started from dealing in real estate relating to commercial entertainment. Previously, they had bought a piece of land in Chuandong and were planning on building their corporation\u2019s third \u201cFeiyu Amus.e.m.e.nt Park\u201d. The investments that had gone into this project were enormous. They were working towards the goal of creating a top tier domestic entertainment base. All sorts of eyes were on them.Because of this, Yang Xin placed a great emphasis on this project. Previously, he had specially invited Daoist priest Mu to perform a spell casting ceremony, and had even invited Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que over to double check. It was also at that time that Yu Zhengdu had come up with the idea of developing an Underworld energy purifier.Who would\u2019ve thought that after so long, their Underworld energy purifier had already been successfully developed, but the problems with Yang Xin\u2019s land had yet to cease.This situation was originally a trade secret, but Yang Xin felt that he knew Yu Zhengdu and them well enough. In addition to the fact that they weren\u2019t compet.i.tors, he told them the truth.It turned out that the standards for the third \u201cFeiyu Amus.e.m.e.nt Park\u201d they were building were extremely high. The configurations in the park had all been created to the standard of top tier international theme parks. To do so, they hadn\u2019t hesitated to spend an enormous amount of money bringing in several completed projects from out of the country. Among these was a Western mythology theme park IP. This IP was currently in use in several developed countries around the world; it was a very famous and very popular project.In order to get this IP, Excellent Jade Corporation had taken several steps back during the negotiation. Both parties had finally reached an agreement and had even finished creating a land use plan when the IP owners suddenly backed out right before things were set to be finalized.Here, Yu Zhengdu combined what he had just learned with the recent trending news and asked, \u201cIs it related to the entry of a different amus.e.m.e.nt park into our country?\u201dYang Xin hadn\u2019t thought that Yu Zhengdu would be able to react so quickly. Immediately, his expression became admiring. He nodded and said, \u201cYes.\u201dJust as Excellent Jade Corporation was in the middle of investing in Feiyu Amus.e.m.e.nt Park, an internationally famous amus.e.m.e.nt park had also announced that they would soon be entering Huaxia. And, their chosen address was coincidentally \u2013 or not coincidentally \u2013 in the southeast area as well, in the zone of business for Feiyu Amus.e.m.e.nt Park.And, after the official announcement of that amus.e.m.e.nt park\u2019s entry into Huaxia, the IP owners who originally were planning to collaborate with Excellent Jade Corporation went back on their word. The reasoning behind this wasn\u2019t hard to a.n.a.lyze.\u201cIn actuality, we had already heard that that amus.e.m.e.nt park was planning on entering the country last year. Which was why we were so determined to get that mythological IP at all costs.\u201d Yang Xin\u2019s tone was filled with bitterness.That international amus.e.m.e.nt park had gotten popular in the past few years and was famous for their special effects and new technology. After their immersive experience got released, they became almost invincible, causing several older amus.e.m.e.nt parks to barely be able to put up an equal fight.It was exactly because of the pressure of such a strong compet.i.tor that Excellent Jade had been forced to find a top tier IP team to collaborate with. But they hadn\u2019t expected that in the end, they would be stabbed in the back by this team.\u201cSo what\u2019s the situation now?\u201d Yu Zhengdu asked.\u201cI\u2019m unclear about the whole situation, but one of my friends gave me some insider information.\u201d The more Yang Xin spoke, the angrier he got. He slammed a hand on the table and said, \u201cThat pair of dishonest a.s.sholes have already signed a contract without telling us. And, the amount the amus.e.m.e.nt park offered was the same as ours! Not even a cent more.\u201dYu Zhengdu watched as the industry\u2019s big boss lost his usual cool. He hurriedly comforted, \u201cBoss Yang, keep calm.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m already very calm.\u201d Yang Xin patted his chest and took a sip of tea. Then, he turned to ask Daoist priest Mu again, \u201cPriest, this pair of dishonest a.s.sholes is even more evil than demons or ghosts. How about this, can you cast a spell that causes the both of them to suffer misfortune?\u201dDaoist priest Mu was an enlightened master indeed. He very calmly stated, \u201cHouseholder Yang, that is wrongful sorcery.\u201dYang Xin downed a few more gulps of tea. His tone was a bit depressed. \u201cTo prepare for this project, we specifically bought an extra piece of land. Now, we don\u2019t know what to do with it either. On the surface, us land developers have all the glory, but in actuality, the cash flow is very limited\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que suddenly laughed coldly off to the side. \u201cYou can sell a couple houses to increase turnover.\u201dYang Xin was suddenly attacked. He looked at Shang Que, perplexed, then said, \u201cThe houses are my personal property. They aren\u2019t related to the company at all.\u201dHe gestured with his fingers, tone resentful, \u201cBut because of this situation, the total amount I\u2019m going to earn in dividends this year is going to be at least ten million less\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThough Boss\u2019s expression seemed to remain unchanged, Yu Zhengdu very knowingly unlocked his phone once more to send a message to the customer service department:\u3010Increase VIP customer Yang Xin\u2019s service fees twentyfold!\u3011The customer service department was extremely shocked:\u3010What did Yang Xin do wrong?\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010Show off his wealth\u3011Customer service department:\u3010\u2026\u2026Oh.\u3011Yang Xin was still complaining off to the side. \u201cRight now I\u2019m truly frazzled with worry. The people below aren\u2019t useful either. A few days ago, the manager of the planning department actually recommended finding a domestic team to collaborate with. If there was such a capable team in the country, would we have needed to spend so much money off the bat buying a foreign IP?\u201dYu Zhengdu casually asked, \u201cWhat suitable teams are there in the country?\u201d\u201cThis is the most infuriating part!\u201d Yang Xin responded angrily. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even bring up a professional project team, just a Ghost Festival garden party created by some company for their employees! A garden party! And for the Ghost Festival! Does that seem suitable to you guys?!\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe more Yang Xin thought about it, the angrier he felt. He started pulling out his phone and said, \u201cThis won\u2019t do. I need to yell at him a bit more.\u201d\u201c , I think his suggestion is pretty good,\u201d Yu Zhengdu started dryly.Yang Xin glared. \u201cHow is it good?\u201dYu Zhengdu looked at him and slowly got out, \u201cGood in that\u2026\u2026the company that did the garden party was our company.\u201dYang Xin: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOff to the side, Yuan Qing could feel the awkward atmosphere. He hurriedly tried to ease the tension, \u201c The flood has washed down the Dragon King\u2019s Temple . What a coincidence.\u201dYang Xin gave him a long look. He couldn\u2019t say what he wanted to.Yang Xin had been beside himself with worry these past few days because of the mythological IP\u2019s sudden renege of their contract. He didn\u2019t have any time whatsoever to pay attention to outside news, nor did he have time to contact his old friends. Thus, he truly didn\u2019t know that Luofeng had planned such an astonis.h.i.+ng Ghost Festival garden party.The manager below him had mentioned it, but before the other had even finished presenting his proposal, he had been kicked out of the office by an agitated Yang Xin.Because of that, Yang Xin had almost missed this IP.Now, Yang Xin finally pulled up the proposal doc.u.ment the manager had previously sent him and looked it over in detail. Then, he opened the videos and pictures related to the Ghost Festival garden party once more. After doing so, he seemed to fall into a trance.Yu Zhengdu went to the bathroom twice. When he returned the second time, he saw that Yang Xin was still glued to his phone. He finally couldn\u2019t take it anymore and asked, \u201cBoss Yang, have you finished looking at it?\u201d\u201cYes, yes.\u201d Yang Xin jolted awake. He stared at Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que unmovingly. \u201cBoss Shang, Little Boss Yu, how come you didn\u2019t invite me to go visit your garden party?\u201d\u201cThis was an employee event,\u201d Shang Que answered coldly. \u201cDo you want to come work at our company?\u201dYu Zhengdu couldn\u2019t help side-eyeing Shang Que. Boss still hadn\u2019t recovered from the shock of over ten million in dividends.\u201cEy, I can\u2019t. I\u2019ve never worked for anyone else before.\u201d Yang Xin waved his hands, giving up in an instant. Immediately after though, he scooted closer and said, \u201cBut, I think our companies can collaborate.\u201dHe waved his phone with the proposal doc.u.ment on the screen and said, \u201cBoss Shang, sell the Ghost Festival garden party IP to our corporation. Cost isn\u2019t an issue.\u201dYu Zhengdu glanced at Shang Que. Shang Que wanted to be more strong-willed and refuse, but upon thinking of the development team behind him that was barking in hunger, he could only lower his n.o.ble ghost head. He hummed and said, \u201cZhengdu decide.\u201dYang Xin was shocked. \u201cIsn\u2019t Little Boss Yu only in charge of the technology?\u201dYu Zhengdu smiled. \u201cOur company is small, so our roles aren\u2019t that specific.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Yang Xin felt joy in his heart. Technicians weren\u2019t very sensitive regarding the market. Talks would be comparatively easier. Though he wasn\u2019t planning on tricking Luofeng, it was still better to have the initiative when it came to these large IPs.Only to hear Yu Zhengdu say, \u201cBoss Yang, we can collaborate on this IP, but we won\u2019t sell it.\u201dYang Xin was a bit confused. \u201cIf you won\u2019t sell, how do you want to collaborate?\u201d\u201cThrough stocks,\u201d Yu Zhengdu stated. \u201cIf we were to collaborate, I hope that our company can do so through buying stock in exchange for our IP and technology. We would own stock in Feiyu Amus.e.m.e.nt Park and earn dividends from profits.\u201dShang Que\u2019s depressed expression finally changed into a smile. \u201cDividends are good. This collaboration format is great.\u201dYang Xin: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu generously increased the benefits. \u201cIf our company collaborates with yours through owning stock, we can waive your VIP customer service fees.\u201dYang Xin: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que even appeared slightly unwilling. \u201cFine, we can get the short end of the stick.\u201dYang Xin: ??????<b>The author has something to say:</b>Today, Xiao Kui lowered his n.o.ble ghost head for the growth of the company once again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61 - DatePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 61 - DateThough Yang Xin didn\u2019t understand why Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que looked like they were making a great sacrifice, he truly really wanted the Ghost Festival garden party IP. Ultimately, he took a step back and agreed to discuss further with the board of directors.Yu Zhengdu wasn\u2019t in much of a rush either. If they were truly to collaborate through buying stock in a project as large as the Feiyu Amus.e.m.e.nt Park, there were innumerous details to be decided on. These would truly fall in his knowledge blindspot. When the time came, their company\u2019s professional business team would be needed for talks.Thus, after reaching an initial agreement with Yang Xin, both sides very accordingly stopped speaking and worrying about anything further.The problem with the amus.e.m.e.nt park project unexpectedly seemed to be on track to getting solved, so Yang Xin was in a great mood. After eating lunch together, he hurriedly bid farewell and rushed off to deal with the remainder of the amus.e.m.e.nt park issues.After an afternoon rest, Daoist priest Mu personally led Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que on a tour of Qinglian Temple.Qinglian Temple had a very long history that could be traced to a thousand years earlier. At its peak, the entire area of the temple covered four times the amount of land it did currently, and was the cultural centerpiece of Diyang City. However, after the rise and fall of several dynasties and inevitable temporal changes, the earliest buildings had long been destroyed. Many book collections and records had been damaged as well. The Qinglian Temple of today had been reconstructed at the tail end of the Qing Dynasty. Even through different catastrophes, it still remained standing; it could be considered one of Diyang\u2019s local landmarks.Yu Zhengdu had known before that Qinglian Temple was holy for all Daoists. The temple itself was also a famous attraction. But only today, after Daoist priest Mu\u2019s introduction, did he come to learn more of Qinglian Temple\u2019s rarely known history. For example, stories of how Qinglian Temple\u2019s previous Daoists had vanquished all sorts of demons and monsters. Among these, legends of how they had invited G.o.ds to aid in their battles were also in abundance.Honestly, if Yu Zhengdu had heard these stories in the past, he would most likely have treated them as retellings of supernatural novels. But right now, he could only express his awe and sigh in admiration.Qinglian Temple had remained standing after the events of a thousand years. It naturally had roots and prowess that outsiders couldn\u2019t shake.In comparison to Yu Zhengdu\u2019s interest, though, Shang Que\u2019s reaction to these stories was much calmer. Oftentimes, he even started daydreaming very obviously. Clearly, he wasn\u2019t interested in these stories at all.Daoist priest Mu wasn\u2019t annoyed though. Shang Que\u2019s reaction was extremely normal for the current era. Thus, he only smiled and said, \u201cAfter hearing these stories, does Householder Shang feel like they\u2019re completely blasphemous and impossible, as if they were only made up by our predecessors?\u201d\u201c ?\u201d After being suddenly asked, Shang Que looked over with a blank gaze. He answered, \u201cThat\u2019s not it. They\u2019re real enough, just a little average.\u201dDaoist priest Mu: \u201c\u2026\u2026Av-average?\u201dDaoist priest Mu was in slight disbelief. It was one thing if someone didn\u2019t believe in these stories. But what was going on if someone said they believed them but found them average? Stories about enlightened masters casting spells to invite G.o.ds and fighting side by side with them in battle couldn\u2019t be considered average, right?Only to hear Shang Que casually say, \u201cInviting ghosts and G.o.ds isn\u2019t a very difficult task. After your cultivation level has reached a certain realm, as long as you maintain a good relations.h.i.+p with the G.o.d you wors.h.i.+p, that\u2019s all you need\u2026\u2026\u201dDaoist priest Mu\u2019s beard slightly trembled. \u201c\u2026\u2026Maintain a good relations.h.i.+p?\u201dBut Yuan Qing had already realized something. \u201cAh, that\u2019s right. Hasn\u2019t Luofeng Company developed a cross-realm technology that allows them to contact the Underworld? Then it truly is much easier for you to maintain a good relations.h.i.+p with them.\u201dDaoist priest Mu paused for a moment. He suddenly said, depressed, \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201dTraditional spell casting was already out of the times. The future would ultimately belong to technology.But Yu Zhengdu knew that that wasn\u2019t what Boss meant at all. After seeing Daoist priest Mu, who had originally been so proud of Qinglian Temple\u2019s history, suffer such a blow, he hurriedly said, \u201cThat\u2019s not everything, though. How could it be so easy to invite a G.o.d down? Maintaining a good relations.h.i.+p isn\u2019t everything.\u201dShang Que nodded. \u201c , it also depends on what the other\u2019s mood was like in that instant.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOnly to hear Shang Que suddenly say, \u201cBut I have seen an above average Daoist before.\u201dDaoist priest Mu, who had originally been silent with sorrow, didn\u2019t notice that he had said 'seen\u201d. He only revealed a curious expression and asked, \u201cOh? How was he above average?\u201dShang Que\u2019s gaze was heavy. He seemed to be searching for a certain story from within his memory. A long time later, he finally spoke, \u201cHe used only his own power to help tens of millions of souls cross. His merits shocked the Heavens, and he instantly became a G.o.d.\u201dShang Que only said a few sentences. But as Daoists, Daoist priest Mu and Yuan Qing were both able to immediately understand what was so shocking about this story. After a long period of silence, Daoist priest Mu finally bowed and sighed, \u201cThat\u2019s truly above average.\u201dDaoist priest Mu asked again, \u201cMay I ask which Daoist that was? I have never heard of such a feat.\u201dYuan Qing added, \u201cSuch a great master should be recorded into the Daoist history books and lauded for being a legend.\u201dShang Que thought about it very carefully. \u201cI think he was named\u2026\u2026Zhang Fang?\u201dDaoist priest Mu: \u201ck2026;k2026;\u201dYuan Qing: \u201ck2026;k2026;\u201dDaoist priest Mu\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201cGrandmaster Zhang Fang\u2026\u2026was a layman disciple of Longhu Mountain.\u201dYuan Qing\u2019s did as well. \u201ck2026;k2026;I heard the Daoists of Longhu Mountain say before that Grandmaster Zhang Fang once had the chance to reach enlightenment and ascend, but later on, he took a journey down the mountain. n.o.body knows what happened after, because he disappeared.\u201dShang Que held his hands out. \u201cHe did ascend.\u201dDaoist priest Mu, \u201cHouseholder Shang, please don\u2019t joke about our predecessors.\u201dThough Shang Que\u2019s story left both Daoists speechless, Daoist priest Mu couldn\u2019t refute him to his face. He could only pretend that nothing had happened and continue leading them to the next location, forcefully turning onto a new page.Yu Zhengdu felt slightly amused. He could tell that this time, Shang Que wasn\u2019t doing this on purpose. He was only speaking the truth. Yu Zhengdu slowed down a bit and scooted close to Shang Que. He deliberately teased, \u201cBoss, you know so many amazing people!\u201dShang Que side-eyed him. \u201cThey\u2019re alright, not that amazing.\u201dYu Zhengdu patted his shoulder. \u201c\u2026\u2026Boss, in the eyes of us mortals, they\u2019re already very amazing.\u201dAs such, they spoke while walking. After seeing the entirety of Qinglian Temple, it was already evening. Daoist priest Mu asked, \u201cI don\u2019t know if these two householders have any plans later on? If you plan on spending the night in Diyang, how about simply staying in the temple.\u201dShang Que looked at Yu Zhengdu. \u201cIf there\u2019s nothing else, let\u2019s head back tonight?\u201dYu Zhengdu paused. Suddenly, he suggested, \u201cIt\u2019s rare that we have the opportunity to come to Diyang. How about staying an extra day to walk around the attractions here?\u201dYuan Qing replied, \u201cThe most famous attraction in Diyang is our temple. You guys just finished walking around it.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dFortunately, he had just done his homework. Thus, he said, \u201cI saw online that there\u2019s a ferris wheel?\u201d\u201cOh, you like those things.\u201d Yuan Qing was a bit surprised, but still very eagerly introduced, \u201cThe ferris wheel just opened last year. However, I heard that business is only so-so. Apparently, only couples go\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIs that so\u2026\u2026\u201d At this point, Yu Zhengdu couldn\u2019t make a decision by himself anymore. He asked Shang Que, \u201cBoss, do you want to go?\u201dShang Que\u2019s expression seemed a bit unnatural. \u201cIf you want to go, then let\u2019s go.\u201dIn all honesty, he didn\u2019t really want to go at all. But\u2026\u2026Yu Zhengdu nodded. \u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201dShang Que acted like nothing was wrong and nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201dThat night, Yu Zhengdu sought out Daoist priest Mu. He said, \u201cDaoist priest Mu, I have a few questions I want to ask you.\u201dDuring the day, he hadn\u2019t been able to speak about this topic in front of Shang Que. Which was why he had found an excuse to stay the night and find Daoist priest Mu individually.Daoist priest Mu: \u201cWhat questions?\u201dYu Zhengdu hesitated a moment before asking, \u201cMay I ask if Qinglian Temple has any records relating to Luofeng Mountain?\u201dRecently, he had searched all over the Internet for information regarding Luofeng Mountain. He had also found several books. But most of the stories had been made up by people after; there were few true records regarding Luofeng Mountain. Additionally, there was absolutely nothing on the Ghost King of Luofeng Mountain. If not for the fact that Jin Heguan had truly brought up this ident.i.ty and the Ghost King seal really did exist, Yu Zhengdu was about to suspect that this ident.i.ty had been made up by Shang Que.Until today, after he heard about the long history of Qinglian Temple, did Yu Zhengdu come up with a thought in his heart. He realized that Qinglian Temple might have records regarding this matter.Daoist priest Mu answered, \u201cWe do, but very few.\u201dAfter returning from his visit with Daoist priest Mu, Yu Zhengdu slowly walked back to his own room while digesting the information he had just learned. When he reached his door, he saw Shang Que leaning against the doorway, head lowered and looking at his phone. Upon seeing Yu Zhengdu, he immediately straightened and asked, \u201cWhere did you go? How come it took you so long to come back?\u201dYu Zhengdu avoided his questions and asked in response, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you want to go out tomorrow?\u201d Shang Que questioned. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we plan our schedule in advance?\u201dYu Zhengdu hadn\u2019t realized that he would be so diligent. He reflexively answered, \u201cThere\u2019s no need for that, right? Aren\u2019t we just going to go to the ferris wheel?\u201d\u201cYou only want to go to the ferris wheel?\u201d Shang Que\u2019s tone was a bit unnatural. \u201cI did some research and found that there\u2019s a park next to it. We can go to the park too after riding the ferris wheel.\u201dWhat a strange itinerary\u2026\u2026Yu Zhengdu even wanted to suggest adding public square dancing to the list too, but travelling wasn\u2019t his true purpose anyways. He thought about it and replied, \u201cOkay.\u201dThe next morning, Shang Que excitedly went to find Yu Zhengdu.Yu Zhengdu walked out with two giant dark circles. He had been bothered by the information about Luofeng Mountain the whole night and had only fallen asleep at daybreak. Now, his eyes seemed like dead fish eyes: completely blank.He originally wanted to suggest giving up on this trip in favor of sleeping inside to Shang Que, but before he even managed to say anything, he heard Shang Que very excitedly saying, \u201cI already preordered the tickets for the ferris wheel online. And I also made a reservation at a very popular restaurant by the park. When the time comes, we can simply head over and won\u2019t have to wait in line.\u201dAt a time like this, if he said anything, he would really be turned into a chicken.Yu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026Give me a moment to change.\u201dThe ferris wheel was next to the park at the center of Diyang City. When Yu Zhengdu got there, he immediately knew why business wasn\u2019t great. Their location was seriously too tragic. The old city district was nearby, so there were no additional recreational facilities in the vicinity. The park was rather large, but normally, the only people who visited were grandmas and grandpas on walks. Aside from couples on dates, there really weren\u2019t many people who specially came.Shang Que retrieved the tickets. While waiting in line for the next turn, he asked Yu Zhengdu, \u201cDo you really like ferris wheels?\u201d\u201cJust average,\u201d Yu Zhengdu answered honestly. \u201cEither way, on a normal day, I wouldn\u2019t specially come to ride one.\u201dShang Que suddenly tightened his grip on the tickets in his hand. He went, \u201cOh,\u201d then said, \u201cIs that so.\u201dCoincidentally, the ferris wheel stopped. The employee rushed them, \u201cIt\u2019s your turn. Hurry and get on.\u201dThe ferris wheel slowly started up again. As they climbed higher and higher, the entire view of Diyang reached their eyes. But Shang Que wasn\u2019t interested in enjoying the view outside. He subtly turned his head to look at Yu Zhengdu, only to see Yu Zhengdu staring back at him, seemingly a bit dazed.Shang Que: !Shang Que faked composure. As if nothing was wrong, he pointed outside and dryly said, \u201cThe view is pretty nice.\u201d\u201c .\u201d Yu Zhengdu suddenly came back to his senses, but only took a single glance outside. Without thinking, he replied, \u201cYou\u2019ve been alive for so long, so must have seen many different views, right?\u201dShang Que froze. He didn\u2019t know why the other was suddenly asking about this. Despite this, he still very seriously pondered the question before calmly responding, \u201cNot really.\u201dThe ferris wheel took a very short amount of time. When they got off it, it was still early. With nothing left to do, Yu Zhengdu followed Shang Que\u2019s plans and started heading toward the park to take a walk.Today was a workday. The park was the territory of grandmas and grandpas. Yu Zhengdu absentmindedly strolled along. Shang Que noticed that he had been this way since morning. After half a day of hesitation, he finally couldn\u2019t help speaking up. \u201cIf you have anything to say, you can say it.\u201dYu Zhengdu paused. He was a bit hesitant, only to hear Shang Que add, \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201dYu Zhengdu scratched his head. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing much. I\u2019m scared you\u2019ll be unhappy\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que\u2019s eyes unconsciously widened. \u201cI won\u2019t be.\u201dBut Yu Zhengdu still couldn\u2019t make up his mind. He instinctively kicked at a pebble by his feet. At this time, the shrill sound of arguing suddenly sounded from beside them. An old lady shouted, \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to go. You\u2019ve gone crazy\u2014\u2014\u201dAnd then that old man said, \u201cYou\u2019re the dumb one. Bhanaka Jue Yin said I\u2019m one of the fated. Do you know how many people wish they were so but aren\u2019t\u2014\u2014\u201dYu Zhengdu turned his head to look. He saw an elderly couple tugging at each other as they walked in his direction. The old lady and old man were fighting over a small bag in their hands. The old man decided to be harsh. He suddenly pushed the old lady onto the ground and ran off with the bag. \u201cWhen I go to the Land of Bliss in the future, you\u2019ll know that this was all worth it.\u201dThe old lady landed on her b.u.t.t on the ground. She slammed her fists against the dirt and wailed, \u201cWhat Land of Bliss. You\u2019ve given all our money to him, we don\u2019t even have enough to survive on now\u2014\u2014\u201dBut the old man completely disregarded what she said. He had long since run off into the distance.Upon seeing this, Yu Zhengdu hurriedly rushed over and helped the old lady up. He asked cautiously, \u201cAuntie, are you okay?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t live anymore, I can\u2019t live like this anymore!\u201d The old lady stood up, shaking. She didn\u2019t seem injured by the fall at all. Instead, she only kept hitting her chest and crying, \u201cWhat will I do in the future\u2014\u2014\u201dYu Zhengdu originally didn\u2019t want to ask about others\u2019 family matters, but after seeing how hard the old lady was crying, he couldn\u2019t help but inquire, \u201cAuntie, did something happen in your family?\u201dAs soon as he asked this, he successfully managed to open up the chatterbox that was the old lady. She instantly grabbed onto his arm and started complaining while crying, \u201cJust now, that person was my husband, Lao Liu. He\u2019s been brainwashed by that Bhanaka Jue Yin. He keeps saying that he\u2019s fated to be with Buddha and that he\u2019ll be able to go to the Land of Bliss in the future. Now he\u2019s gone crazy, adamant about donating all of our money to Bhanaka Jue Yin!\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Yu Zhengdu hadn\u2019t expected that this story would be so astonis.h.i.+ng. For a moment, he was a bit confused and couldn\u2019t casually respond. He could only carefully state, \u201cThen Uncle is a bit too impulsive.\u201d\u201cNot even. He\u2019s not the only one.\u201d Auntie Liu resentfully ground her teeth. \u201cThere\u2019s so many people who believe in that Bhanaka Jue Yin. Several of my neighbors\u2019 families have been in a mess because of this situation too.\u201dYu Zhengdu was shocked. \u201cSo bad?\u201d\u201cYou must be from out of town, right? You haven\u2019t even heard of Bhanaka Jue Yin?\u201d Auntie Liu asked.Yu Zhengdu nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cNo wonder.\u201d Auntie Liu cussed while she spoke, \u201cBhanaka Jue Yin only came to Diyang to preach recently. He propagates his teachings in this park. Apparently, he\u2019s some eminent monk for some kinnara sect. As soon as he got here, he gained so many wors.h.i.+ppers. My neighbors all used to be Qinglian Temple\u2019s wors.h.i.+ppers, but now, they don\u2019t even go to Qinglian Temple anymore. Every day, they go listen to Bhanaka Jue Yin give lectures. They also say something like, if they can be blessed by Bhanaka Jue Yin, they\u2019ll be able to go to the Land of Bliss after death. Right now, they\u2019ve all gone crazy, one by one, fighting to donate money to him\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu\u2019s mouth kept twitching upon hearing this. \u201cWhy does it sound so much like a cult?\u201d\u201cIt is a cult!\u201d Auntie Liu responded, grinding her teeth.\u201cKinnara?\u201d Shang Que seemed to have found the crucial detail. He slightly furrowed his brows, \u201cIsn\u2019t that just a small G.o.d that dabbles in music? Even it has a following?\u201d\u2026\u2026Yu Zhengdu wasn\u2019t very knowledgeable on the G.o.ds in Buddhism, but that didn\u2019t stop him from being shocked by Shang Que\u2019s word choice.Only to see Auntie Liu immediately start nodding. \u201cYes yes yes, their promotional technique is saying that only the fated can hear the music of the Land of Bliss. But I say that\u2019s all a load of bulls.h.i.+t!\u201dThe more she spoke, the angrier she got. She brushed off Yu Zhengdu and started running. \u201cThis won\u2019t do. I need to try and stop him again. Otherwise, how will we survive in the future!\u201dYu Zhengdu asked Shang Que, \u201cLet\u2019s go check it out too?\u201dShang Que stared at him for a bit. His face was expressionless, but his tone seemed a bit cold. \u201cThen let\u2019s go check it out.\u201dYu Zhengdu actually strangely managed to sense, quite rarely, that Shang Que was unhappy. He seemed to feel something, but temporarily couldn\u2019t tell what it was.But, there was one thing he was very sure about.It would be best for that Bhanaka Jue Yin if he could truly broadcast the music of the Land of Bliss.Otherwise, Shang Que would most likely directly send to the Land of Bliss.<b>The author has something to say:</b>Bhanaka Jue Yin: Ascends on the spot\u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62 - Performance Guest KinnaraPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 62 - Performance Guest KinnaraYu Zhengdu and Shang Que followed Auntie Liu towards the place Bhanaka Jue Yin was giving his lectures.Along the way, Shang Que gave Yu Zhengdu a simple introduction to kinnaras. Kinnaras were one of the Eight Legions of Buddhism. They represented the legion of music, so were also called music G.o.ds. In actuality, they were the G.o.ds in charge of music; more specifically, they were all talented musicians and dancers. Every time any of the legions held an a.s.sembly, the kinnaras were in charge of being accompanists.Shang Que\u2019s tone was filled with mockery as he spoke, \u201cThey\u2019re just party performers. How inconceivable that they could form a sect.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe still maintained his composure and responded, \u201cThat\u2019s quite normal. These days, party performers are all celebrities. Many of their fans act like members of cults anyways.\u201dShang Que thought about it. \u201c , you\u2019re right.\u201dSoon after, they reached the park\u2019s public activity center. What they saw shocked them immensely: the entire public activity center had been cleared out. On the floor, flocks of people gathered. By estimate, there were several hundred. The majority of these people were older men and women. They all sat cross-legged, heads raised and facing forward.Though there were a lot of people present, the scene was extraordinarily quiet. Not a single person was speaking.On the center\u2019s elevated platform, there were two monks. One was approximately forty years old. He sat on a cus.h.i.+on, a string of mantra beads in his hand, and was in the middle of lecturing to the people below. Obviously, this was the famed Bhanaka Jue Yin.A young novice monk stood beside him. He held a chest in his hands; this was his accompanying disciple.When Yu Zhengdu and them arrived, Bhanaka Jue Yin had already reached the end of lecture. He was in the middle of slowly saying, \u201cToday\u2019s lecture ends here. After this, my disciple and I will head to the next location and continue helping others.\u201dSomeone instantly shouted out from below, \u201cGreat Master Jue Yin, don\u2019t be in such a rush to leave. We still want to listen to your lectures.\u201dEveryone else immediately nodded. \u201cExactly, exactly. Great Master, please stay in Diyang.\u201d\u201cWe will continue following the ways of Great Master and the Kinnara King!\u201dBhanaka Jue Yin\u2019s expression was completely calm. With an att.i.tude befitting a great master, he spoke, \u201cYou\u2019ve all been incredibly kind, but as the Kinnara King\u2019s head disciple, I\u2019m responsible for helping all living beings and those suffering hear the music of the Land of Bliss. How could I disregard all of them in favor of my own comfort?\u201dAfter Bhanaka Jue Yin\u2019s eloquent speech, the wors.h.i.+ppers present all immediately appeared impressed. They didn\u2019t dare to try and keep the other anymore, only saying, \u201cGreat Master has worked hard.\u201d\u201cSpreading Buddhism and Sanskrit to save all living beings from suffering is the order the Kinnara King gave. I daren\u2019t take credit for it.\u201d Bhanaka Jue Yin sighed gently. With a kind expression, he said, \u201cOnly, the living are innumerous, the suffering is endless; who knows how long it will take to reach the end of this path. Who knows how many difficulties will need to be overcome. My sole wish is that all humans may feel the Great Kinnara King\u2019s kindness. This way, my efforts will not have been in vain.\u201dFollowing Bhanaka Jue Yin\u2019s words, everyone bowed in synchronization, saying, \u201cDisciple will definitely follow the teachings of the Kinnara King.\u201dBhanaka Jue Yin nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s good. As long as everyone sincerely wors.h.i.+ps the Kinnara King and dedicates themselves to Buddhism, you will surely be able to ascend to the Western Land of Bliss in the future.\u201dAfter Bhanaka Jue Yin said this, an old lady suddenly stood up from below. There was a small cloth bag in her hands. She said, \u201cBhanaka, you\u2019ve worked hard spreading Buddhist teachings. This is a bit of thanks. I hope Bhanaka won\u2019t dislike it.\u201dAfter the old lady spoke, a few others also pulled out their previously prepared gifts and added, \u201cGreat Master has worked hard. Just a little bit of thanks that we hope you can accept.\u201dBhanaka Jue Yin appeared indifferent, as if he was unmoved. \u201cMy actions are all due to the Kinnara King\u2019s orders. Everything I do is to help the world, not for earthly pleasures.\u201dYu Zhengdu maintained a cold expression as he watched. He complained to Shang Que, \u201cThis Great Master is so cunning.\u201dAs expected, right after he spoke, the wors.h.i.+ppers immediately started pleading, \u201cGreat Master, these are for the Kinnara King. We request that you please accept them.\u201d\u201cExactly exactly. We only wish to help Great Master spread the Kinnara King\u2019s Sanskrit faster to be able to help all living beings.\u201d\u201cWe only hope that Great Master will be able to continue keeping your disciples in mind in the future, so we can once again experience the wonders of Sanskrit.\u201dBhanaka Jue Yin heaved a long sigh. With a seemingly helpless expression, he stated, \u201cSince these are all offerings for the Kinnara King, then I am unable to refuse them on his behalf. As such, I will accept them in his stead. Later on, I will definitely express your sincerity to the Kinnara King and help everyone reach Bliss sooner.\u201dUpon hearing this, the wors.h.i.+ppers became overjoyed. They immediately bowed. \u201cThank you, Great Master.\u201d \u201cThank you, Great Master!\u201dBhanaka Jue Yin turned to gesture to the novice monk. \u201cJie Hui, you come help the Kinnara King accept everyone\u2019s thanks.\u201dJie Hui nodded. He walked down the stairs and opened the chest in his arms while saying, \u201cEveryone, please line up well. Come one at a time.\u201dYu Zhengdu was expressionless. \u201c\u2026\u2026After so much pretense, turns out he already had the chest ready.\u201dHe heard someone else shout out sorrowfully, \u201cMy son locked away all my savings and money. I can\u2019t get them out.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know that Bhanaka Jue Yin would be leaving today, so couldn\u2019t prepare anything in advance. What should I do?\u201dOnly to see Jue Yin very familiarly pull out a QR code placard from inside the chest and say, \u201cEveryone, there\u2019s no need to be agitated. If you have your phone, you can also simply transfer money by phone.\u201dYu Zhengdu didn\u2019t even have the energy to complain anymore. \u201c\u2026\u2026This Great Master is too out of line!\u201dThe crazed wors.h.i.+ppers fought to get in line. Auntie Liu finally found Uncle Liu in the crowd too. With a powerful shout, she charged forward. As soon as she grabbed onto the old man, she started hitting him. \u201cLao Liu, if you dare to donate all our money today, I won\u2019t let you off easy!\u201dThe people around them were shocked by this sudden change. They immediately stopped what they were doing to hide off to the side and watch the drama unfold.Lao Liu instantly felt incredibly embarra.s.sed. While avoiding Auntie Liu\u2019s attacks, he yelled, \u201cWhat does a woman like you know? This is called creating merits, understand? The Great Kinnara King will protect us.\u201d\u201cProtect you your a.s.s. Can the Kinnara King buy rice and vegetables for you? Or can he pay your utility bills for you?\u201d Auntie Liu was furious. She became more and more resolute. \u201cI\u2019ve wors.h.i.+pped at Qinglian Temple for so many years and never spent that much money. This Kinnara King thing barely opened its mouth but is already asking for all your wealth. Have you heard of a G.o.d that acts like this?\u201dAfter Auntie Liu said this, not even Lao Liu, but everyone else around them\u2019s expressions became displeased. Someone who knew her spoke up. \u201cAuntie Liu, what you said was wrong. The Kinnara King didn\u2019t ask for money; we\u2019re the ones who want to donate.\u201d\u201cExactly. The Kinnara King has blessed us with Sanskrit, bringing us closer to the Land of Bliss. This is only a way for us to express our grat.i.tude.\u201dAuntie Liu had a touchy temper. Upon witnessing this, she remained impenitent and placed her hands on her hips to refute, \u201cI think it\u2019s clearly you guys who have been brainwashed. After you donate all your money, how are you going to survive?\u201dAuntie Liu\u2019s words caused great outrage among everyone. The surrounding crowd became indignant and immediately started yelling back at her. Some more agitated ones actually got physical and pushed her. \u201cDo you dare to repeat what you just said!\u201dAuntie Liu was on her own. After getting pushed, she almost fell down once more. Fortunately, Yu Zhengdu had already predicted that this was going to happen, so opportunistically stepped forward and helped her steady herself. He stood in front to protect her, then started trying to placate the crowd. \u201cEveryone please calm down a bit, please calm down\u2014\u2014\u201dHow could the crazy wors.h.i.+ppers listen to him? They immediately started yelling, \u201cShe dares to disrespect the Kinnara King! Truly too evil!\u201d\u201cExactly. Hurry and apologize, then beg the Kinnara King for forgiveness.\u201d\u201cWhen the Kinnara King lowers his punishment, you\u2019ll know to feel regret!\u201dYu Zhengdu hurriedly waved his hands and said, \u201cDidn\u2019t you just say that the Kinnara King preaches about being compa.s.sionate? It would be too petty for him to punish someone over such a small issue!\u201dEveryone: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe crowd of people originally in the throes of scolding suddenly had nothing to say in response. But some people nevertheless weren\u2019t impressed. They stuck their necks out and continued to berate, \u201cEven if the Kinnara King doesn\u2019t care, we still refuse to let her off easy!\u201dSomeone was just about to express their agreement, only to see Yu Zhengdu furrow his brows and say, \u201cThen wouldn\u2019t you be going against the Kinnara King\u2019s teachings in doing so? If the Kinnara King found out, he would probably be angry too.\u201dEveryone: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWith this, everyone else also shut up. A feeling of anger was stuck in their chests. They wanted to continue arguing, but couldn\u2019t find the right point of entry. The atmosphere temporarily became slightly awkward. Someone instinctively looked toward Bhanaka Jue Yin.At this time, Bhanaka Jue Yin finally stepped forward. He drawled out, \u201cAll beings suffer. The difficulties of the current world are necessary to progress to the Land of Bliss. These few almsgivers, why be harrowed by the now and spend all your time deliberating over the trivialities of the earthly realm?\u201dAs soon as the bhanaka started speaking, his wors.h.i.+ppers immediately quieted. Additionally, someone even spoke up to help the bhanaka lecture. \u201cBhanaka Jue Yin is the disciple of Bodhisattva Samgharama , the Kinnara King. He was once personally enlightened by the Kinnara King. After, he created the Kinnara Sect. Currently, Bhanaka travels around the country, spreading Buddhism and helping all living beings. He blesses everyone with the Sanskrit of the Land of Bliss.\u201dBhanaka Jue Yin nodded. He stared at Yu Zhengdu and his posse kindly. \u201cAs long as you repent and set down your greed and wrongful desires, the Kinnara King will wash away your sins and aid you in your journey to Bliss.\u201dHere, Yu Zhengdu had a faint suspicion in his heart. It seemed like this Kinnara Sect garnered fans by telling people they could help them reach the Land of Bliss. This wasn\u2019t very different from the methods used by any other religion. What was truly strange was how crazed these wors.h.i.+ppers appeared. They seemed to absolutely believe in this Kinnara Sect, to the point that they were willing to give up all of their wealth.Yu Zhengdu\u2019s brain started whizzing. But Shang Que had already started scoffing. \u201cThese days, even kinnaras can help people reach Bliss?\u201dYu Zhengdu immediately reached an epiphany. Starting with Uncle Liu, these wors.h.i.+ppers all kept bringing up Blissful Sanskrit. And kinnaras were the Western music G.o.ds. It was likely that this was related to the reason Bhanaka Jue Yin could attract so many people\u2019s faith.As expected, as soon as Shang Que spoke, someone couldn\u2019t help responding: \u201cThe Great Kinnara King\u2019s power knows no bounds. Of course he can!\u201d\u201cExactly, exactly. Bhanaka has been personally enlightened by the Kinnara King. He originally already left to the Land of Bliss, but to help all living beings cross, he specially returned from the Land of Bliss, bringing with him Buddhist teachings and Sanskrit. He has allowed us to learn of the wonders of the Land of Bliss.\u201d\u201cBhanaka gave up on the opportunity to become a G.o.d. What does it matter if we offer him some of our trivial wealth?\u201d\u201cBhanaka has allowed us to hear the sound of the Land of Bliss!\u201dAs soon as Sanskrit got brought up, someone\u2019s expression immediately became engrossed. \u201cSanskrit is too wonderful. Just from hearing that sound, I can already imagine how beautiful the Land of Bliss must be.\u201dYu Zhengdu became alert. He thought to himself,Auntie Liu\u2019s expression became perplexed as well. \u201cWhat is Sanskrit actually? Lao Liu always talks about it too.\u201dShe was Qinglian Temple\u2019s faithful wors.h.i.+pper and had wors.h.i.+pped at Qinglian Temple for over a decade. She didn\u2019t believe in other religions at all and had never attended a single one of Bhanaka Jue Yin\u2019s lectures. This was the reason she was so confused.\u201cEy\u2014\u2014\u201d Only to hear Bhanaka Jue Yin suddenly heave out a long sigh. His expression was completely sorrowful. He said, \u201cPeople of this realm are all stubbornly ignorant. Without seeing the manifestation of a true Buddha, they always believe that they are in the right. They speak insolently and sin\u2026\u2026 Nevermind. Today, I will try my best to cast another spell and invite down the Holy Kinnara Light. I will allow those suffering to experience the music of the Land of Bliss\u2026\u2026\u201dTheir surroundings immediately become overjoyed. \u201cGreat Master, are you being serious?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s amazing! We\u2019ll be able to hear the sound of Bliss once more!\u201d\u201cBhanaka, you\u2019ve worked hard!\u201dBhanaka Jue Yin waved his hands. He appeared to be making a great sacrifice. \u201cAs long as I am able to enlighten these ignorant mortals, what does the suffering I have to endure matter.\u201dHe sounded like he was lamenting. This immediately made everyone feel respectful, and also made them glare vehemently at Yu Zhengdu and the others.\u201cGreat Master is righteous. Instead of arguing with you guys, he is going to help bless you. Hopefully, you know to repay such grace.\u201d\u201cTo be able to hear Sanskrit is your immense fortune. From now on, you must properly wors.h.i.+p the Kinnara King.\u201dBhanaka Jue Yin waved his hands, gesturing for everyone to quiet down. Finally, he looked at Yu Zhengdu and them, revealing a mysterious smile. \u201cAlmsgivers, now, I would like to ask you to please prepare to experience the sounds of the Land of Bliss with me.\u201dUnder Yu Zhengdu, Shang Que, and Auntie Liu\u2019s gazes, Bhanaka Jue Yin returned to the raised platform and sat on the cus.h.i.+on. He took off the beads around his wrist, rested them on both palms, lifted them above his head, and started chanting.At the same time, the novice monk Jie Hui sat properly off to the side and started burning incense. Fragrant white smoke slowly drifted out, creating a mysterious atmosphere.Amids the curtain of smoke, Bhanaka Jue Yin finished chanting. He called out, \u201cCordially inviting the Great Kinnara King to bestow the Holy Light upon us and bless the people. Bring the sound of Bliss to this sea of suffering.\u201dThe wors.h.i.+ppers around them had all seen this ceremony before. Upon seeing it again, they became extremely excited. Unconsciously, they started scooting closer to the front.Yu Zhengdu also couldn\u2019t help following everyone\u2019s gazes. He locked onto the prayer beads raised high in the air.The beads looked quite old. They were a s.h.i.+ny black and faintly reflected light from amongst the smoke.Right after, they saw two thumb-sized b.a.l.l.s of light fly out from the prayer beads and slowly halt in the air.Yu Zhengdu instinctively moved closer. Finally, through the thin veil of smoke, he saw that there were actually two little people in the b.a.l.l.s of light. One was male and the other female. The male had a horse head and human body; in his hands, he held a drum. The female had a dignified appearance. She was holding a harp.He then looked around. It seemed that n.o.body else could see these two tiny individuals. Obviously, they weren\u2019t mortals.Shang Que calmly whispered into his ear, \u201c , they truly are the performance guests of the Western a.s.sembly, kinnaras.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d He originally thought that these two little people were pretty G.o.dly because of the halos of light that had appeared with them. But after Shang Que\u2019s commentary, their G.o.dly light buff immediately disappeared.He looked over again and felt that these two tiny G.o.ds didn\u2019t appear G.o.dly in any way whatsoever anymore.Bhanaka Jue Yin was also looking at these two kinnaras. His expression appeared faintly pleased. He was now waiting for them to start playing to shock these ignorant mortals.But, for some reason, the two kinnaras suddenly halted in midair, seemingly like they had been frozen in place. For a long time, they didn\u2019t move.The wors.h.i.+ppers who had been prepared to listen didn\u2019t hear any Sanskrit after a prolonged period. They couldn\u2019t help looking over in bewilderment.Bhanaka Jue Yin was perplexed as well. He had no other choice but to signal again, \u201cI request the Great Kinnara King to bestow Sanskrit upon us.\u201dThe kinnaras in the air remained motionless.Their surroundings were silent. The legendary Sanskrit still hadn\u2019t sounded out.The wors.h.i.+ppers started making a slight fuss. Now, Bhanaka Jue Yin couldn\u2019t stay still anymore. Despite the possibility of being found out by his wors.h.i.+ppers, he scooted closer to look at the kinnaras. He saw that they both appeared shocked for an unknown reason, almost as if they had been struck by a bolt of lightning. Upon closer inspection, he finally realized that they were staring straight ahead at a certain spot. Their bodies also seemed to be imperceptibly shaking.Bhanaka Jue Yin was quite confused. He followed their gazes to look. And then, he met Shang Que\u2019s eyes.Shang Que had both arms crossed in front of his chest. He was in the middle of expressionlessly staring down the two kinnaras. After noticing that Bhanaka Jue Yin was looking over, he finally scoffed and glanced at the kinnaras. \u201cGreat Kinnara King?\u201dBhanaka Jue Yin immediately felt shock appear in his heart. He thought,He was still guessing whether or not the other was speaking to the kinnaras, but the two kinnaras had already spiraled into panic. They knelt midair and pleaded, \u201cNo no, we aren\u2019t kinnara kings, only tiny kinnaras.\u201dThe male kinnara said, \u201cI\u2019m the Drummer Kinnara.\u201dFemale: \u201cI\u2019m the Harpist Kinnara.\u201dBoth of them: \u201cWe\u2019re only the accompanists and singers at a.s.semblies. The Kinnara King was made up by this monk to trick people. He\u2019s not related to us at all!\u201dBhanaka Jue Yin: ??????Yu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d<b>The author has something to say:</b>Bhanaka Jue Yin: Great Kinnara King, please bless us with Sanskrit!Kinnaras: We don\u2019t dare to, we don\u2019t dare to!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63 - Online SanskritPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 63 - Online SanskritHistorically, little G.o.ds of low status often escaped to the mortal realm from the Heavenly court. To avoid the Heavenly soldiers, they would usually have their own unique techniques for evading detection.The technique of music G.o.ds was to shrink themselves and secretly hide in mortals\u2019 homes. Those a bit stronger could even transform into a mortal\u2019s body part, thereby hiding on the mortal. There were records of an escaped music G.o.d who had once turned itself into a polyp and hidden in the nose of some heiress.The two kinnaras kept by Bhanaka Jue Yin were the little G.o.ds under the seat of the true Great Kinnara King. Before the collapse of the Heavens and Earth, they had escaped to the mortal realm. Initially, they had turned tiny and hidden in mortals\u2019 houses, but would often leave accidental traces, causing the mortals to feel suspicious. These mortals would then invite monks and Daoists to perform removal spells. Thus, the kinnaras were forced to keep switching hiding locations, until the enlightened monk invited by a certain household recognized that they were G.o.ds. This monk subtly captured them for his own use.Before his death, that monk pa.s.sed these two kinnaras down to his disciple, Bhanaka Jue Yin. Jue Yin wasn\u2019t as powerful as his master, but was much better at marketing than him. He immediately recognized the value of these two G.o.ds. As such, he packaged the music G.o.ds a bit and, borrowing the name of the Kinnara King, formed the Kinnara Sect. He himself then transformed into the disciple of the Great Kinnara King, embarking on the path of scamming all the lands through spreading the supposed Kinnara Sanskrit.Relying on his silver tongue and religious excuses, along with the music of the Western a.s.sembly performed by the two little G.o.ds, Bhanaka Jue Yin\u2019s preaching path was completely uninhibited. He earned an enormous amount of money.Jue Yin had never expected that he would run into someone else who could see the true forms of the kinnaras here.Even more unexpectedly, the two kinnaras immediately knelt in front of this person. They didn\u2019t even give him a bit of time to mentally prepare!Bhanaka Jue Yin was stunned. He wanted to get a clear explanation, but couldn\u2019t expose himself in front of all these wors.h.i.+ppers. In this moment, he became beside himself with worry, failing to get even a single word out.The wors.h.i.+ppers around them had waited for a long time, but the music of the Land of Bliss still hadn\u2019t started. They couldn\u2019t help looking at each other in confusion. Someone blurted out, \u201cGreat Master Jue Yin, where\u2019s the music of Bliss?\u201dAfter one person spoke, others immediately followed. \u201cSo you didn\u2019t hear anything either? I thought that I had lost my fate. That scared me to death.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t hear anything either.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? The Great Kinnara King didn\u2019t hear Great Master\u2019s request?\u201dBhanaka Jue Yin\u2019s face was red with restraint. He could only force himself to hint once again, \u201cHonorable Great Kinnara King, do you hear your wors.h.i.+ppers\u2019 requests? This is the faith that you wanted.\u201dShang Que scanned the kinnaras. \u201c ?\u201dBoth kinnaras waved their hands. \u201cWe don\u2019t want it, don\u2019t want it.\u201dJue Yin: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMore and more people started asking questions. Bhanaka Jue Yin had no idea what to do. Fortunately, he had been in the art of scamming for several years, so was pretty good at improvising. His expression immediately tensed. \u201cAh, the Kinnara King is currently a bit busy. It isn\u2019t convenient for him to lower the Sanskrit for everyone right now. But don\u2019t worry, we just need to wait a moment.\u201dUpon hearing his explanation, the wors.h.i.+ppers couldn\u2019t help feeling a bit disappointed. However, they didn\u2019t suspect anything else. After all, Bhanaka Jue Yin had truly displayed his abilities previously.Only those two foreign young people seemed completely unconvinced by Jue Yin\u2019s excuse.Shang Que coldly stared at the two kinnaras. He calmly said, \u201cCome here.\u201d\u201cComing, coming. We\u2019ll be there in an instant.\u201d Both kinnaras immediately flew to Shang Que in panic, completely disregarding the step of even symbolically asking Jue Yin for permission. Their departure could only be described as quick, concise, and completely merciless.Jue Yin: \u201c\u2026\u2026You guys!\u201dHe wanted to yell , but if he actually did, his own ploy would probably be up soon.The two kinnaras stood in midair beside Shang Que like they were soldiers at attention: their postures were entirely up to standard. Looking at this made Jue Yin\u2019s eyes red with anger.Usually, he fed these two little G.o.ds the best food and drinks, all to placate them. But they had never appeared so respectful to him before.Only, now wasn\u2019t the time to be hung up over this. After calling the kinnaras over, Shang Que\u2019s gaze fell on Jue Yin. With a smile that wasn\u2019t really a smile, he said, \u201cGreat Master, weren\u2019t you going to broadcast some music?\u201dJue Yin: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dA thin sheet of sweat appeared on his forehead. He didn\u2019t dare to answer at all. He couldn\u2019t guess what the other\u2019s ident.i.ty was, or why the kinnaras had immediately submitted upon seeing the other.However, even though he didn\u2019t answer, his wors.h.i.+ppers wouldn\u2019t allow his prowess to be questioned right in front of their eyes. Someone refuted for him, \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear what Great Master said? The Kinnara King is busy right now\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que was too lazy to bother with what others were saying. He only raised his chin at the two kinnaras. \u201cPlay music.\u201d\u201cOkay okay.\u201d The kinnaras immediately nodded, then one set up his drum and the other picked up her harp. They started furiously performing.Jue Yin: \u201ck2026;k2026;\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201ck2026;k2026;\u201dThe wors.h.i.+ppers\u2019 reb.u.t.tals for Jue Yin hadn\u2019t even been spoken yet when they suddenly heard the music that they yearned for day and night sound out from their surroundings.Gentle drum beats, drawn-out harp chords; like a dream and also like an illusion; in between existing and imaginary. After mortals heard it, they immediately felt purified, as if the worries and stress on their minds had suddenly disappeared.Even Yu Zhengdu, who had prepared himself for this and knew the truth, felt himself wavering. His entire being unknowingly calmed down.Such music was truly rare. In addition to Jue Yin\u2019s purposefully mysterious ceremony, the fact that it was appearing from nowhere and couldn\u2019t be found from any other source, no wonder it was capable of garnering the elders\u2019 trust. It made sense that they believed this sound originated from the Land of Bliss.Accurately speaking, this was indeed the music that would be performed during a.s.semblies in the Land of Bliss. Only, the music was being performed live, not being sent from the Land of Bliss as Jue Yin had been promoting. It also couldn\u2019t help anyone remove their sins and become saints after death.The wors.h.i.+ppers around them immediately became immersed. Someone couldn\u2019t help but calling out, \u201cThis is it\u2026\u2026Blissful Sanskrit!\u201d\u201cI hear it too. It\u2019s real\u2026\u2026\u201dBut a while later, someone announced their suspicions, \u201cThis time the music seems a bit rushed?\u201dYu Zhengdu couldn\u2019t help watching the two kinnaras eager to redeem themselves\u2026\u2026This couldn\u2019t even be considered rushed anymore. They were completely strained, okay.Shang Que lifted his gaze to look at the kinnaras. \u201cHear that? Slow down.\u201d\u201cWe heard it, we heard it.\u201d The kinnaras hurriedly nodded, then paused their motions. They immediately started playing more slowly. The music in the air slowed in accordance, appearing even more melodious.At this time, someone among the wors.h.i.+ppers finally realized something was wrong. Because Uncle Liu had been towed to the front by Auntie Liu, he could clearly see and hear what Shang Que was doing and saying. Immediately, he asked in slight disbelief, \u201cWait a minute. Could it be that this time, the Sanskrit\u2026 could it be that you\u2019re the one who asked for it?\u201dActually, several wors.h.i.+ppers had witnessed this scene. Only, in the beginning, many of them weren\u2019t too sure. After Uncle Liu shouted this out, they could no longer resist. All of them started whispering to each other.Someone asked Jue Yin, \u201cGreat Master, are you the one who asked for this Sanskrit, or was he?\u201dHow could Jue Yin dare to answer? But Shang Que didn\u2019t bother leaving a way out for him. Under everyone\u2019s curious gazes, he calmly said, \u201cStop.\u201dThe kinnaras instantly stilled. The melodious music stopped as well.As such, it became clear as day who was actually controlling this Blissful music.Uncle Liu felt that his faith had suffered a great blow. He stared at Shang Que and inquired, \u201cHow come you can ask for the Blissful Sanskrit too?\u201dHow could the other wors.h.i.+ppers not be shocked? They too turned to look at Jue Yin in disbelief. \u201cGreat Master, didn\u2019t you say that the Kinnara King is busy right now? How come this guy can invite the Sanskrit?\u201d\u201cHe, he\u2026\u2026I\u2026\u2026\u201d In all his years in the jianghu , this was Jue Yin\u2019s first time encountering a situation he didn\u2019t know how to handle.The main way the Kinnara Sect collected followers was through the Sanskrit that seemed to be from the Land of Bliss. Because it was completely unique and sounded from nowhere, these elders entirely believed in this music.But now, two young men who suddenly appeared could easily reprise the Sanskrit, proving that this sound didn\u2019t solely belong to Jue Yin.That which was the basis of the Kinnara Sect naturally collapsed as well.The old people present slowly started becoming more and more suspicious. They waited for Jue Yin to give an explanation.Some switched their focus onto Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que instead. Perhaps these two youths could also invite the Sanskrit because they were disciples of the Bodhisattva as well?There were quite a few people who thought this. Uncle Liu was standing in the front and also was related to Auntie Liu. Thus, he voiced everyone\u2019s suspicions, \u201cYoung men, I want to ask how you guys managed to invite the Sanskrit?\u201dAfter he asked this question, the most nervous person among the crowd was actually Jue Yin. Those two kinnaras had completely jumped s.h.i.+p. It would be incredibly easy for these two young people to pretend to be Buddha\u2019s disciples if they wanted to. He was terrified that someone else would benefit from the followers he had finally gathered through the Kinnara Sect.Jue Yin was on high alert. But Shang Que was too lazy to bother with others\u2019 thoughts. With both arms crossed in front of his chest, he appeared quite disdainful. \u201cThis is nothing\u2026\u2026\u201dBefore he managed to finish, he suddenly got tugged on by Yu Zhengdu. Shang Que paused and turned around to look at him.Only to see a righteous expression on Yu Zhengdu\u2019s face. The other pulled out his phone from his pocket and told everyone, \u201cThis is nothing. The Internet is so advanced these days, what music can\u2019t you find? As long as you all download a music player, you\u2019ll be able to hear whatever you want to hear\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que completely swallowed what he had been about to say. A moment later, he quietly made a noise of acknowledgment.Jue Yin: ?????The wors.h.i.+ppers around them were also bewildered. Uncle Liu\u2019s entire face was twitching. He made a noise of utter disbelief and asked, \u201cYoung man, say that again?\u201d\u201cI said\u2014\u2014\u201d Yu Zhengdu paused after each word to ensure that the elderly individuals present would be able to clearly understand. \u201cThe Sanskrit you guys heard can easily be found online\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cImpossible!\u201d A grandma seemed unable to accept this reality. She yelled, \u201cSuch a sound, I have never heard before in my life.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s only because you\u2019re unfamiliar with the Internet.\u201d Yu Zhengdu calmly and patiently explained to the grandma, \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, I can show you.\u201dHe secretly muted his phone. Upon seeing this, Shang Que immediately understood his intentions. He glanced at the two kinnaras and lightly asked, \u201cKnow how to cooperate?\u201d\u201cYes yes yes.\u201d The kinnaras furiously nodded, like they were chicks pecking at millet.With the Ghost King supervising, Yu Zhengdu was fearless. He looked around in a circle, then smiled and said, \u201cPay close attention, everyone.\u201d\u201cStart.\u201d As he spoke, he randomly pressed a b.u.t.ton. Upon seeing this, the kinnaras hurriedly started performing.Jue Yin: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe originally undecided old people immediately widened their eyes. They looked at each other; the grandmas who had originally been speaking also listened attentively. A moment later, they finally expressed in disbelief, \u201cReally, it really is Blissful Sanskrit!\u201dEveryone else could obviously tell too. This sound that could be controlled with the phone was clearly exactly the same as the Sanskrit that Bhanaka Jue Yin had previously said was incredibly difficult to ask for from the Kinnara King\u2026\u2026Who would\u2019ve thought that the Blissful music they had believed in unconditionally, to the point of giving up all their wealth, was actually music from online. One could even download it onto their phones. In only an instant, everyone\u2019s expressions became bewildered. For a long time, they were immersed in this shock, unable to recover.After an unknown amount of time, someone finally took the lead to give a shout of despair and anger, \u201cI see how it is, you old bald donkey! You dare to use stuff from online to fool us!\u201dThis sound of rage awakened everyone else. They finally came back to their senses and realized that right now, what they needed to do was exact revenge on Jue Yin.Sincere elders were the easiest to be tricked, but similarly, when they discovered the truth, they were the hardest population to deal with.Anyone could tell that Jue Yin was about to get beaten up by his previous wors.h.i.+ppers. He no longer cared if his own tricks would be exposed because of his explanation and pointed at Yu Zhengdu and them to shout, \u201cThey\u2019re lying. That music\u2019s not playing from the phone at all. The kinnaras are performing next to him.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d Yu Zhengdu looked at him expressionlessly and silently pressed a b.u.t.ton on his phone. Beside him, the kinnaras hurriedly stopped moving.The Sanskrit immediately came to a halt.Jue Yin: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHis vision went black.With this, the elderly individuals became completely convinced that Yu Zhengdu was telling the truth. They all started grinding their teeth, then charged forward to beat Jue Yin up.Upon seeing this, Yu Zhengdu hurriedly shouted, \u201cEveryone, don\u2019t get physical! That\u2019s illegal!\u201dHow could the elderly accept this? They immediately responded, \u201cThat won\u2019t do. We can\u2019t let this scammer get away!\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t let him get away, but we must follow the law.\u201d Yu Zhengdu said, \u201cI already called the cops earlier.\u201dAfter hearing this, Jue Yin became extremely alarmed. He did his best to squeeze through the crowd and escape, but it was already too late. The sound of police sirens drifted in from outside.Bhanaka Jue Yin\u2019s lectures for old people had been reported to the police by family members of those involved long ago, but Jue Yin was extraordinarily cunning. From early on, he had trained these elders to be on the lookout for him. As soon as anything seemed wrong, he would immediately disappear. Additionally, these elderly individuals were very protective of him. Sometimes, they were even a bit unreasonable. The police had no evidence, so couldn\u2019t do anything; besides, each time, Jue Yin would pull a quick scam at each location before heading to the next. He never spent too much time in one place. To this day, he hadn\u2019t left behind any condemning evidence.But this time, his plan completely failed. These previous wors.h.i.+ppers were no longer protecting him. Instead, they were all stepping up to be witnesses and provided several records of donation and money transfer. With both witnesses and physical evidence present, Bhanaka Jue Yin and disciple were thrown into prison with handcuffs on. After conviction, the money they scammed was returned to the elders who had been tricked. Even the wors.h.i.+ppers he had collected in other areas had been forcefully disbanded. Thus, the supposed Kinnara Sect existed no longer.Currently, the police took Bhanaka Jue Yin away, gathered some testimonials on-site, and also invited the old people who had been scammed the most money, and their families, to testify at the station.Neither Yu Zhengdu nor Shang Que were victims. They only needed to give a testimony on-site. There was no need for them to go to the police station too.After the police left, the remaining elderly individuals instantly surrounded Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que. They fought to hand their phones over, saying, \u201cYoung man, may I ask how to download the Blissful Sanskrit? We want to save it in our phones too.\u201d\u201cThat old bald donkey is truly detestable, but this music is still great. Please teach us.\u201dYu Zhengdu\u2019s expression didn\u2019t even change as he made up an excuse on the spot. \u201cOnline music is copyrighted. It can\u2019t be casually downloaded so easily.\u201dOld people didn\u2019t really know much about copyrights, but still understand the gist of what Yu Zhengdu meant. All of them appeared extremely disappointed and regretful. \u201cCan\u2019t be downloaded?\u201d\u201cI understand copyrights. Does it mean we have to pay for it? I can pay!\u201d\u201cIf it means I can download Sanskrit, I\u2019m willing to pay.\u201dUpon seeing how antic.i.p.atory they were, Yu Zhengdu felt a bit of hesitation in his heart. Then, he also thought of how touching the music of the Land of Bliss truly was. Even he couldn\u2019t help wanting to hear it once more. Thus, in a moment of impulse, he said, \u201cHow about this. When I go home, I\u2019ll find the copyright owners and discuss with them. If I\u2019m able to buy the copyright license, I\u2019ll send it to everyone.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great, that\u2019s amazing!\u201d After much disappointment, they finally had hope again. The elders were overjoyed, so why would they have any issues? They immediately asked to add him on WeChat. \u201cThen please send it to us as soon as possible after you discuss with the owners about the copyright license.\u201dYu Zhengdu naturally couldn\u2019t add all of them on WeChat. In the end, he only added the people in charge, then asked them to help him create a group chat. He agreed to send the song to everyone for downloading after getting the copyright to do so.Before leaving, Yu Zhengdu didn\u2019t forget to remind everyone, \u201cThese days, there are all sorts of scams. If you encounter any similar situations in the future, it\u2019s crucial to discuss with your family members first. Don\u2019t believe others so easily.\u201dAfter this episode, those elderly individuals still felt a lingering fear. They immediately nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll never do it again.\u201dYu Zhengdu and Shang Que left the activity center together. The two kinnara carefully followed them the whole way out. When they reached an unpopulated location, the two finally transformed into their original size, which was about the same as a normal person. They bowed deeply to Shang Que. \u201cWe little G.o.ds greet the Great Ghost King.\u201dYu Zhengdu asked in confusion, \u201cSince you\u2019re already G.o.ds, why did you go around scamming people with that monk?\u201dThe two kinnaras subtly exchanged glances. Their expressions seemed a bit sheepish. A moment later, they finally spoke, \u201c\u2026\u2026Jue Yin said doing things this way would help us achieve faith.\u201dWhen they had escaped to the mortal realm, the Heavens and Earth still existed. To avoid the Heavenly soldiers, they had no other option but to rely on Jue Yin\u2019s master. After, when they got pa.s.sed down to Jue Yin, the Heavens and Earth had already collapsed. They no longer needed to live in hiding, but then, Jue Yin had enticed them with the faith of mortals.Kinnaras were only little G.o.ds of the Heavenly court. They had low statuses; in the past, they could only share a little bit of incense fire from the Great Kinnara King. After escaping, they didn\u2019t even have that tiny bit of incense fire anymore. But Jue Yin\u2019s expanded cult promotions could instantly bring a great amount of faith to them. To little G.o.ds like them, this was seriously hard to resist.\u201cWe really know that we were wrong. Ghost King, please forgive us,\u201d The kinnaras continuously pleaded with trembling voices.\u201cBoss, how should we deal with them?\u201d Yu Zhengdu asked Shang Que.The mistake these two kinnaras had made couldn\u2019t be considered too great, but also wasn\u2019t trivial. And, they were some of the only G.o.ds remaining after the collapse of the Heavens and Earth. Though they were of low status, it still wouldn\u2019t be right to punish them too harshly.Shang Que hummed coldly. \u201cI\u2019ll punish them to clean the bathrooms at our company.\u201dKinnaras: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que noticed Yu Zhengdu\u2019s speechless expression, thought about it, and changed his mind. \u201cYou can decide.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Yu Zhengdu looked at the two kinnaras, smiled, and said, \u201cI want to ask you two to record your music so I can send it to those elderly individuals.\u201dThe kinnaras were terrified that they would still be sent to clean the bathrooms. They hurriedly nodded, \u201cOf course, of course. We will definitely obediently record.\u201dShang Que glanced at them and coldly said, \u201cBut the copyright license will be ours.\u201dKinnaras: \u201c\u2026\u2026Okay.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64 - Life Planning APP, OnlinePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 64 - Life Planning APP, OnlineAfter resolving the issue with the kinnaras, Yu Zhengdu looked at the time and discovered that it was already afternoon. They had missed their originally scheduled lunch.Thus, Yu Zhengdu wanted to suggest to Shang Que that they should grab a casual bite to eat. But before he could say anything, he saw Shang Que put down his phone and look over. Seemingly casually, the other said, \u201cThat restaurant still has open tables. Let\u2019s head over.\u201dYu Zhengdu hadn\u2019t expected that Shang Que would still remember that restaurant. He momentarily became slightly shocked. \u201cWhat food does that restaurant serve?\u201dShang Que was lost. \u201cI haven\u2019t looked at the menu yet.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe found himself temporarily speechless. But upon seeing how antic.i.p.atory Boss was, he smiled and replied, \u201cAlright. Then let\u2019s head over now.\u201dThe corners of Shang Que\u2019s mouth unknowingly quirked up into a faint smile. He was just about to start moving when he saw Yu Zhengdu turn around and look at the two kinnaras. \u201cYou two come along too.\u201dShang Que: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe two kinnaras pressed their hands together and bowed. \u201cImmense grat.i.tude that Sir isn\u2019t disdainful of us. We little G.o.ds are endlessly thankful and will surely follow you.\u201dAfter they said this, the two looked up, only to meet Shang Que\u2019s cold gaze.The kinnaras tensed. They didn\u2019t know if they had done something wrong again, so asked in panic, \u201cMay I ask the Great Ghost King\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSince you know that I\u2019m Great, you still dare to be the same size as me?\u201d Shang Que raised his chin and looked down at them. \u201cShrink.\u201dKinnaras: ???Yu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dBut how could the kinnaras dare to question this? As soon as Shang Que finished speaking, the two jumped in place. Yu Zhengdu only felt his vision go blurry. Then, he saw that the two music G.o.ds had returned to their thumb-sized bodies and were floating in midair.The male kinnara clasped his hands together and lowered his head. \u201cThe Ghost King is Great. We\u2019re Tiny.\u201dShang Que crossed both arms over his chest. Though his face was expressionless, his tone was still quite displeased. \u201cStill very bothersome.\u201dThe female kinnara was about to cry. \u201cGreat King, we really can\u2019t get any smaller.\u201dYu Zhengdu speechlessly watched them act like elementary school students and discuss the literal definitions of words. In this instant, he only felt very disillusioned by these G.o.ds and ghost. His mouth twitched. He decided to play middleman. \u201cNo worries. This is fine.\u201dFinally, Shang Que let out a reluctant noise of acknowledgment.Yu Zhengdu glanced at the two kinnaras once more, then muttered to himself, \u201cOh right. I saw that the monk Jue Yin kept you guys in his prayer beads? We don\u2019t have prayer beads. Should we prepare some for you?\u201dShang Que scoffed. \u201cThey\u2019re already fortunate to have a place to live. Dare they be picky?\u201dThe kinnaras furiously shook their heads. \u201cAbsolutely not. We can live wherever.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu pondered a bit and said, \u201cThen you can stay in my hood for now. When I get back, I\u2019ll find somewhere else for you guys to stay.\u201dHe was wearing a hoodie today. The hood rested on his back; the two kinnaras could sit very comfortably inside. Shang Que wouldn\u2019t be able to see them there either.Shang Que: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe restaurant Shang Que had made a reservation at was in a mall a few streets away from the park. The overall structure was predominantly made of gla.s.s. There was a large quant.i.ty of flowers, plants, and other greens as decoration. This made the atmosphere appear extremely fresh and neat. As expected, it looked like an Internet-famous store.When Yu Zhengdu and them got there, it was already past normal mealtime. There weren\u2019t many people in the restaurant, but it was very evidently catered mainly to couples. Yu Zhengdu hadn\u2019t thought that the restaurant Shang Que had specially reserved would be of this style. He couldn\u2019t help teasing, \u201cBoss, can\u2019t tell that you\u2019re actually so romantic!\u201d\u201c .\u201d Shang Que\u2019s expression was slightly unnatural. He pretended like nothing had happened, casually saying, \u201cAs long as you like it.\u201dAs they spoke, a violin suddenly started playing from beside them, successfully cutting off their conversation.The two looked over and finally realized that there was a violin player seated two tables away. A couple had originally been sitting there: it seemed that the performance had been prepared for the woman by the man. They watched as the woman\u2019s face exhibited an expression of delighted surprise. The two of them stared at each other affectionately with the violin song as background music. The atmosphere was extremely sweet.Yu Zhengdu couldn\u2019t help smiling upon seeing this. He lamented, \u201cHow romantic.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d Shang Que was somewhat unimpressed. He handed the menu over. \u201cOrder first.\u201dYu Zhengdu nodded. After brief thought, he twisted around to lowly ask behind him, \u201cKinnaras, do you guys want to eat with us?\u201dThe two kinnaras popped their tiny heads out from his hood and carefully asked, \u201cWe can eat too?\u201dShang Que: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201cOf course.\u201dHe finally remembered that Boss was still there after he finished speaking. Thus, he hurriedly turned around to inquire, \u201cThey can, right?\u201dWhat else could Shang Que say? He could only reluctantly agree.The kinnaras instantly cheered in excitement. They flew out from the hood and landed on the table. The two of them added together barely even reached half the height of the cup of water. The female kinnara said, \u201cIn this form, we only need to eat a little bit. It won\u2019t be a waste of food.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s very nice.\u201d Yu Zhengdu smiled and poured them a drink. The two kinnaras leaned against the edge of the cup, happily drinking. They looked like two cup hangers.The more Shang Que looked at them, the more displeased he felt. Coincidentally, the violin player nearby had just finished his performance. An idea struck. He reached an index finger out and flicked the male kinnara, knocking him off the cup. He said, \u201cYou two, perform for us.\u201dKinnaras: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe kinnaras didn\u2019t dare to refuse. Thus, the two of them obediently stood off to the side. One beat his drum and the other played her harp. The dreamy Sanskrit slowly sounded out. Yu Zhengdu unconsciously revealed a blissed out expression. \u201cWow, this music really gives one the impulse to want to become a monk.\u201dShang Que: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que bent his finger and flicked that male kinnara again. \u201cWe\u2019re eating. Don\u2019t play Blissful music. Change to something else.\u201dThe female kinnara said with difficulty, \u201cGreat King, we don\u2019t really know anything else\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que slightly furrowed his brows. \u201cYou guys have lived in the mortal realm for so many years. You didn\u2019t even learn any mortal music?\u201dAs soon as he brought this up, the two kinnaras were suddenly struck with realization. \u201cWell, we did learn some\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c , then perform those.\u201d Shang Que\u2019s tone was filled with implication. \u201cSomething more pop. Suitable for us to hear.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201d The male kinnara very understandingly nodded. He exchanged glances with the female kinnara; a drum and a harp prepared.\u201c Deng deng deng deng deng deng ~ My love is as vast as the Heavens~\u201dThe next second, the male kinnara got flicked into the air. If not for the fact that he needed to maintain his elegance, Shang Que probably would\u2019ve squished him with his finger. \u201cWhy is it \u2018The Most Dazzling Folk Song\u2019?\u201dThe female kinnara stated with a pained expression, \u201cGreat King, these years, we\u2019ve spent our time preaching with Bhanaka Jue Yin, which has mainly taken place at the squares where old people commune. The music we\u2019ve heard the most are the ones played for public square dancing\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu almost burst into laughter from off to the side. He was just about to placate Shang Que when he suddenly received a message. He opened it and immediately became alert. Excitedly, he grabbed Shang Que\u2019s wrist. With s.h.i.+ny eyes, he said, \u201cBoss!!!\u201dShang Que had originally been coming up with an excuse to beat up those two kinnaras. Out of the blue, he got grabbed by Yu Zhengdu. His heart skipped a beat. He looked up once more and met Yu Zhengdu\u2019s bright eyes. He couldn\u2019t help tensing. Reflexively, he flipped his hand around and held onto Yu Zhengdu\u2019s palm. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dYu Zhengdu was still in an immensely excited state. He didn\u2019t find anything wrong with Shang Que\u2019s actions at all. Instead, he even wrapped his other hand around Shang Que\u2019s in further elation. \u201cOur app\u2019s mobile server has been successfully developed!\u201dShang Que\u2019s eyes slightly widened. After a pause, he finally seemed to regain his wits. He made a soft noise of acknowledgment, then nodded and said, \u201cGot it.\u201dYu Zhengdu was a bit confused by Boss\u2019s reaction. He shook the other\u2019s hand around and asked, \u201cBoss, aren\u2019t you happy?\u201d\u201cHappy. I\u2019m very happy.\u201d Shang Que nodded expressionlessly. His gaze fell onto the kinnaras. He said, \u201cYou two. Perform.\u201dThe kinnaras while trembling: \u201cP-Perform what?\u201dShang Que: \u201c\u2018The Most Dazzling Folk Song\u2019 will do.\u201dPrior to Zhao Ruola\u2019s addition to Luofeng, Yu Zhengdu had already finished part of the Life and Death Accounts mobile server plan with Zheng Yan. Yu Zhengdu had also partic.i.p.ated in a good portion of the developmental work.After Zhao Ruola\u2019s addition, the entirety of the developmental work for the mobile server advanced forward. Following several rounds of debugging, the mobile server finally could become completely combined with the backend system that Yu Zhengdu was in charge of. As such, the app had finally been successfully developed.The final name decided on for the app was simple and straightforward: \u201cLife Planning\u201d.But it still couldn\u2019t be immediately used after development. Before the official version could be formally released, Luofeng first created a release candidate. This was a step that every serious app needed to take during the first phase after development.The Luofeng headquarters were in charge of sending a limited number of activation codes to targeted users. After the users tested the app, they would give the company a rundown of how their usage experience had gone and any problems they had found. The company would then use this as a guide for the next update. When all this ended, the app could finally be officially released.Because this app contained information regarding the past, current, and future lives of the Underworld community, Yu Zhengdu and Zhao Ruola decided, after intense discussion, that the initial functions of the app release candidate would be as simple as possible. This way, unresolvable problems could be avoided.Currently, the entire app only provided three very basic functions:\u3010Personal Information\u3011,\u3010Good and Evil Scores\u3011, and\u3010Self-Service Reincarnation\u3011.The release candidate needed volunteers from the Underworld community. In the end, they chose one thousand spirits using stratified sampling of different deceased populations, including but not limited to natural death from old age, death from illness, accidental death, suicide, murder, those of both genders and all ages, etc. These people all partic.i.p.ated in the internal testing for the Life Planning app.Of course, the data from the release candidate users wouldn\u2019t be saved or used. After the testing, the volunteer ghosts\u2019 data would be deleted. This was to avoid the possibility of others\u2019 taking advantage of the bugs in the testing phase.The citizens of the Underworld normally had a lot of time on their hands. Aside from awaiting reincarnation, they could only wait for offerings. Additionally, with Luofeng\u2019s help, a group of ghosts had been able to achieve their goals of returning to work after arriving in the Underworld. This made everyone antic.i.p.ate Luofeng\u2019s technology even more. Thus, as soon as they heard about Luofeng\u2019s internal testing for their app, the number of applicants rose so rapidly it could be compared to the amount of people fighting for the position of civil servant in the mortal realm.The ghosts who were qualified for the testing were also very proactive. They quickly downloaded the app and started using it. In only a few days, Luofeng\u2019s headquarters had already received several suggestions.The one that got suggested the most was regarding the app\u2019s\u3010Personal Information\u3011function. Everyone immediately expressed that it should be changed to\u3010 Ghost-al Information \u3011.After receiving this suggestion, Yu Zhengdu considered it before judging that this request was reasonable. Thus, after brief discussion with Zhao Ruola, they quickly changed the name of this function.The Amazing Future programmers who got this message: \u201c\u2026\u2026?????\u201dCurrently, the offices of Luofeng\u2019s headquarters and the subsidiary company, Amazing Future, were separate. The employees at the subsidiary company were all mortals. Though they usually interacted with the Luofeng headquarters occasionally, the headquarters had a very strict set of rules and regulations. They wouldn\u2019t allow their coworkers at the subsidiary company to see things such as walking through walls, was.h.i.+ng eyeb.a.l.l.s, or other similar scenes.Consequently, the programmers at the subsidiary all thought that the headquarters were a bit mysterious and strange, but after thinking of the weird products their company sold, n.o.body minded.Including this app. The two tech masters had only said that they were developing it for a special group of customers, refusing to allow even their coworkers at the subsidiary company join in on the testing. Everyone thought about this and realized that all the clients who could buy their company\u2019s products probably weren\u2019t very normal. Thus, they didn\u2019t make a big deal out of it.Programmers weren\u2019t in need of such strange thoughts. After all, they had all seen niche apps stranger than this one before.But the change of \u201cPersonal Information\u201d to \u201cGhost-al Information\u201d was still strange enough to shock people greatly.However, Yu Zhengdu had impressive skills and the support of the Big Boss. In their company, he was the absolute authority. If he wanted to change it, no one else could say anything.Liu Wei was a normal but also abnormal programmer at Amazing Future.He was normal in that he was like the majority of programmers: often working overtime, single, curious, and addicted to spending time online. He was abnormal because even under high stress working environments, he was able to maintain a head of very thick hair. This caused many of those in the same field to be incredibly envious.After the release of the app\u2019s release candidate, the workload of the developmental department slightly lessened. Those in their department could finally get off work on time too. But, as a single dog who lived alone, Liu Wei decided to continue on his path and work overtime.On this day, he once again stayed behind in the company to study Yu Zhengdu and Zhao Ruola\u2019s code. Unknowingly, he became entranced. Though this program had been developed by the department as a whole, he could still immediately tell which parts of the code had been written by the two tech masters. They were simple, elegant, and practically bug-free. As a programmer, Liu Wei couldn\u2019t help the impulse in his heart after seeing this code. He really wished to have an opportunity to experience how the app worked.He thought about it and secretly sent an activation code to his own phone. But after he downloaded it, a popup appeared: Not in service range. Download failed.Liu Wei: \u201c????\u201dTheir company\u2019s wifi was undoubtedly excellent. Besides, they hadn\u2019t encountered this problem during development?He tried a few more times, but kept getting the notification that he wasn\u2019t in service range. He was about to give up when suddenly, inspiration struck. He switched to the phone the company had given them during the development process. Immediately, he successfully downloaded the app.What strange occurrence was this?Liu Wei had some suspicions in his heart \u2013 was there something wrong with the phone model or configurations? But he still followed the instructions and started registering for an account.This app had a very overbearing design. Users needed to register with their personal ID number. Liu Wei didn\u2019t dare to use his ID number, so bought a made-up one online. Who would\u2019ve thought that after he entered this number, the page read: Fake number. Registration failed.Liu Wei: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThis was a bit too intelligent?! It could even tell real and fake numbers apart?He was honestly too curious. After a long moment of consideration, he decided to give it his all. Bravely, he used his personal ID to register. He finally successfully registered, but after opening the page: User\u2019s life signs are fine. Does not qualify for inquiry conditions. Please refresh in a hundred years.Liu Wei: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026??\u201dWhat was the ultimate purpose for their company to develop this app!!!!Liu Wei fiddled around for a long time, but was still unable to open the app\u2019s few functions. This caused him to seriously suspect that a terrible bug had appeared in their system. He decided that tomorrow, he would find the head of technology to give feedback on this situation.After he finally decided to give up, he looked up and discovered that it was already past midnight.He turned around to observe his surroundings. As expected, he was the only one remaining in the office. Liu Wei wasn\u2019t bothered at all. He stood up and stretched, then prepared to leave work and head home.But as soon as he stood up, he found that a light was s.h.i.+ning from somewhere a few tables down. Uncertainty rose in his heart. He walked over to take a look and realized that it was light reflecting off of the eight trigrams mirror on their product manager, Zheng Yan\u2019s, desk.Speaking of Zheng Yan, this was also a strange person who often left people speechless. The words Zheng Yan used the most often were: prosperity, culture, peace, science, etc. Every minute and every hour, he reminded everyone to have the conscientiousness that every socialist youth should have.But on his table, objects such as eight trigram mirrors, calabash gourds, copper swords, etc. would frequently appear. Most absurdly, two kilograms of yellow paper could appear.His daily habit was to chant while reminding everyone, \u201cScientific methods of avoiding evil.\u201dLiu Wei picked up the eight trigrams mirror that had randomly started mysteriously glowing. He then thought of Zheng Yan. In an instant: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHe was just about to set it down when a voice suddenly sounded out from behind him. \u201ch.e.l.lo, may I ask if you\u2019re one of Luofeng\u2019s employees?\u201dIt was the middle of the night. No one else was in the office. The sudden appearance of such a voice instantly scared Liu Wei a lot. He turned around to look, breath hitched. He saw a youth holding a phone, dryly staring at him.In the light of the eight trigrams mirror, the youth\u2019s face appeared slightly green. This made one\u2019s heart tremble in fear.He also didn\u2019t know where this person had popped up from. He hadn\u2019t heard any indications at all.Liu Wei\u2019s face paled. He pressed down on his chest. After finally managing to calm down, he aggressively responded, \u201cI am. Who are you? How did you get in?\u201dAmazing Future was Luofeng\u2019s subsidiary company. Saying that he was Luofeng\u2019s employee wasn\u2019t technically wrong. Thus, Liu Wei casually confirmed this.\u201cAh, you can see me. I\u2019m right, then.\u201d The youth sighed in relief, then pushed away Liu Wei\u2019s hand. \u201cDon\u2019t point that mirror at me. It\u2019s uncomfortable.\u201dLiu Wei was bewildered. But probably because it was the middle of the night, he instinctively refused to let go. While still holding onto the eight trigrams mirror, he asked, \u201cWhat do you need?\u201dThe youth said, \u201cI\u2019m a volunteer for the Life Planning app\u2019s release candidate. I have a bold suggestion and was scared that I wouldn\u2019t be able to relay it clearly in the group chat, so decided to pay a visit in person to explain to you guys.\u201dLiu Wei furrowed his brows and asked, \u201cIs it because there\u2019s a bug in the app so it can\u2019t be opened? I already know about that and will bring it up with the company tomorrow\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cNo no, the app is running very smoothly. No freezing.\u201d As the youth spoke, he handed his phone over. \u201cI just wanted to ask if your app can add a friend circle function. This would help us deceased individuals recreate societal relations.h.i.+ps after death, you know?\u201dLiu Wei: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201d<b>The author has something to say:</b>Kinnara: Our next learning goal is, courage!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65 - Programmers Never Encounter GhostsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 65 - Programmers Never Encounter GhostsFor a moment, Liu Wei froze. Eventually, he spoke, \u201cSay that again?\u201dThe youth did as he asked. \u201cI just wanted to suggest that our app could add a friend circle function. Would that be possible?\u201dLiu Wei\u2019s expression was cold. \u201cWeChat already has a friend circle function. It would be pretty much useless if we created one too.\u201d\u201cHow could that be the same?\u201d The youth looked like he didn\u2019t agree. \u201cWeChat is for your friends in life. You can\u2019t contact them again after death. I hope that Luofeng will be able to help us achieve reunion in death.\u201dLiu Wei: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dReunion in death\u2026\u2026 Liu Wei couldn\u2019t help being petty for a moment. \u201cHow come you aren\u2019t suggesting for us to create an Underworld forum to help the dead resolve all the various difficulties they experience?\u201dThe youth clapped. \u201cGood idea! As expected, professionals\u2019 ideas are more all-encompa.s.sing!\u201dLiu Wei: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dBut the youth\u2019s expression was extremely sincere. Thus, he felt a bit embarra.s.sed instead and stopped mocking the other. Only, he became even more curious about how this app worked. He couldn\u2019t stop himself from asking, \u201cCan you give me your phone for a moment?\u201d\u201cOf course, of course. You guys were the ones who developed it anyways.\u201d The youth enthusiastically handed his phone over.Liu Wei had originally thought that there was a bug in the app, which was why he couldn\u2019t open it. However, upon looking over the version in the youth\u2019s phone, all functions were working smoothly.He first clicked into the\u3010Ghost-al Information\u3011section. The youth\u2019s registration information appeared on the page.Name: Zhong Kas.e.x: MaleID number: *****************xTime of Death: x Hour, x Month, x Day, 2018Cause of Death: Car accident on Desperate MountainResidence in Life: 99 Ancient Well Boulevard, Ancient Well District, Fu CityGrave Location: Fu City\u2019s Public Western CemeteryLiu Wei: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThough he already knew the app\u2019s contents because he had helped develop them, personally seeing someone fill out these areas so seriously still made him feel quite conflicted. Especially upon noticing that the other had actually simulated a time and cause of death. What could be going on in his mind?Liu Wei\u2019s mouth twitched. He still needed to act like nothing was wrong and ask Zhong Ka, \u201cCould it be that Fu City\u2019s Public Western Cemetery is your ideal grave location?\u201dAccording to his understanding, this youth was probably doing this for fun and had chosen his favorite cemetery in advance or something.Only to see Zhong Ka\u2019s expression become glum. \u201cNot even. My family chose that spot. The ideal grave location for me would obviously be Mingzhu\u2019s Private Cemetery, but it\u2019s too expensive. My family couldn\u2019t afford it.\u201dLiu Wei: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dZhong Ka excitedly continued to ask, \u201cSay, \u2018grave location\u2019 sounds too ordinary. Can you change it to \u2018royal mausoleum\u2019 or something along those lines?\u201dLiu Wei almost choked. \u201c\u2026\u2026What, there\u2019s an imperial throne you need to inherit?\u201dZhong Ka snickered. \u201cBecause I never experienced what it was like to be rich when alive, it would be nice to dream about such things in death, you know?\u201dLiu Wei: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd andk2026;k2026;\u201d Zhong Ka wasn\u2019t done yet. \u201cI think in the Ghost-al Information section, you can add an k2018;Epitaph\u2019 slot. Kind of like an individual signature. You don\u2019t know this, but in life, I had already come up with my epitaph. Unfortunately, I hadn\u2019t expected to die so soon, so wasn\u2019t able to tell my family in advance what to inscribe on my gravestone. k2018;I still am more inclined towards Mingzhu\u2019s Private Cemetery.\u2019 What do you think?\u201dLiu Wei pretended he hadn\u2019t heard anything and calmly clicked open the second part of the app:\u3010Good and Evil Scores\u3011This module was currently fairly simple. Only two lines of text showed up:Good and Evil Scores: Details unavailableImportant Life Events: [Click for details]Zhong Ka curiously asked, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t we allowed to look at the details of our good and evil scores?\u201dYu Zhengdu had personally developed this section. Even Zhao Ruola hadn\u2019t partic.i.p.ated. Though the things showing up were very simple, Liu Wei knew that the calculations behind them were extremely complex. And, certain parts of the information had been encrypted. He didn\u2019t really know anything either, so could only vaguely say, \u201cOur CTO wrote this code. I don\u2019t understand it.\u201dAs he spoke, he also clicked into the last module:\u3010Self-Service Reincarnation\u3011This was also the module he was the most curious about. As a member of the development team, he naturally knew the original model and finished model for this app. But as for the app\u2019s market orientation and target users, the company had never gone into detail. Only, looking at Boss and the two tech masters\u2019 att.i.tudes, it was very likely that this app would only be designed for a specific group instead of being publicly released or distributed on the app stores.The employees in the development department had discussed this in private before. In the end, everyone anonymously theorized that maybe because the company\u2019s strange evil removal and health products were geared towards more superst.i.tious people anyways, they had developed this app possibly to attract these kinds of clients. It would help everyone simulate the feeling of reincarnating into a next life. The ultimate goals were most likely built-in advertis.e.m.e.nts, product promotion, and the like.But even so, everyone still believed that this app\u2019s functions were too ridiculous:Under the influence of intense curiosity, Liu Wei clicked open the\u3010Self-Service Reincarnation\u3011page:Reincarnation Time: June 13, 2019Reincarnation Point: Ancient Well Reincarnation Point, Ancient Well District, Fu CityReincarnation Point Contact Number: 404-*******Reincarnation Path: HumanDetails of Reincarnation Path: Middle cla.s.s familyOne-click Reincarnation: [Agree]Reincarnation Help: 1) Countdown notifications for reincarnation 2) Reincarnation point mapping service 3) Emergency servicesAfter long-pressing on the screen, a description page would also appear:Description:1.

Users who have not clicked [Agree] to one-click reincarnation must create their own plan for reincarnation. In order to prevent messing up the schedule, users who attempt to escape reincarnation will be severely punished. Please do not believe that you might luck out;3. If you encounter unexpected situations such as evil ghosts preventing you from reincarnating or other such instances, please press [Emergency Help] or call the reincarnation point contact number to receive a.s.sistance.Luofeng Life Management Co. Ltd. is wholeheartedly here to serve you.Liu Wei: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen they had been developing it, they had felt that this app was very silly. After seeing real users using it, a feeling of \u2018seriously being silly\u2019 became all the more apparent. It rushed at him, causing him to instantly grow increasingly confused as to how to interact with this user.But the users seemed to be much better at getting accustomed than he was. Zhong Ka pointed at the page and very sincerely conferred with Liu Wei, \u201cI think that this reincarnation path section can be more humane\u2026\u2026 Oh, I mean, more ghost-ane . We all know that the reincarnation path is decided based on the Good and Evil Scores. Would it be possible to provide us some reference data so we know what scores are linked to what reincarnation path? This way, we\u2019ll have more of a general idea.\u201d\u201cAnd, how are these Good and Evil Scores actually calculated? For example, what causes Good Scores, what causes Evil Scores. This way, it can help us do good things with a clear goal\u2026\u2026\u201dLiu Wei\u2019s expression reflected his mental breakdown. He watched Zhong Ka very seriously offer ridiculous function suggestions for this ridiculous app. But these suggestions seemed to fit the app\u2019s original qualities very well. Temporarily, he actually found it difficult to discern if he was the abnormal one or if the other was the abnormal one.What was quite rare, though, was that Liu Wei could still maintain a tech homebody\u2019s exemplar logical thinking skills. He could even follow Zhong Ka\u2019s train of thought and discuss with him, \u201cI understand what you mean. You hope that we can make this Good and Evil Scores section similar to those missions in games, where different missions are a.s.sociated with different Good Scores and Evil Scores, right? After accepting a mission and completing it, you\u2019ll be able to collect the corresponding score. Different score levels are linked to different reincarnation results\u2026\u2026this way, you\u2019ll be able to accept different missions to achieve your ideal reincarnation results.\u201d\u201cExactly!\u201d Zhong Ka gave him a thumbs up. \u201cAs expected from Luofeng\u2019s employees. Too outstanding.\u201dLiu Wei expressionlessly stated, \u201cI will relay your suggestions to our Leader.\u201dZhong Ka nodded and didn\u2019t forget to remind the other, \u201cAnd those friend circle and forum functions\u2026\u2026\u201dLiu Wei: \u201c\u2026\u2026Got it, got it.\u201dNo wonder this Zhong Ka had specially rushed to the company in the middle of the night. He truly had a lot of suggestions.Liu Wei looked up at the time. Unknowingly, it had already pa.s.sed midnight. He yawned and pushed Zhong Ka towards the exit. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ve noted them all down. Hurry and head back. It\u2019s the middle of the night, aren\u2019t you tired?\u201dAs Zhong Ka walked, he muttered, \u201cThe middle of the night is when I\u2019m most awake \u2026\u2026\u201dLiu Wei pushed him to the doorway. Just as he was about to close the door, he discovered that he was still holding onto Zheng Yan\u2019s eight trigrams mirror. He hurriedly ran back to Zheng Yan\u2019s spot and set the item down. After, he walked out and looked around, but discovered that the youth named Zhong Ka had already disappeared.\u201cHe left so fast.\u201d Liu Wei scratched his head and pressed on the elevator b.u.t.ton, only to discover that the elevator was still stopped on this floor. It hadn\u2019t gone down. A strange feeling flashed through his mind, but it was already quite late. He was honestly too tired, so didn\u2019t think too much of it. He slowly got into the elevator and went home.Because the app\u2019s Good and Evil Scores section had been solely developed by Yu Zhengdu, the next day during work, Liu Wei went straight to Yu Zhengdu, still yawning. He shared what had happened last night when he had encountered Zhong Ka. At the end, he admitted, slightly embarra.s.sed, \u201cLeader, does our app have a lot of problems? I originally wanted to download it on my phone, but it said that my phone was out of service range. And, after I registered, I still couldn\u2019t use it\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu vaguely explained, \u201cOh, I added a design that requires authorization from headquarters after registration before the app can be used.\u201dLiu Wei was extremely confused. \u201c\u2026\u2026Is that necessary?\u201dYu Zhengdu didn\u2019t answer his question. Instead, he asked with a strange expression on his face, \u201cYou encountered one of our release candidate volunteers?\u201dLiu Wei nodded. \u201cYeah. Our release candidate users are too diligent. He came to the company in the middle of the night. And, let me tell you, at the time, Zheng ge\u2019s equipment suddenly started glowing. Scared me half to death\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu didn\u2019t try to scare him either. He only followed the other\u2019s train of thought and inquired what new ideas the release candidate user had given during his personal visit to the company.Liu Wei complained while relaying, \u201cHe wants us to create a friend circle and forum. I\u2019m in utter disbelief. Who could make a better friend circle than WeChat\u2019s? Isn\u2019t that just wasting resources?\u201dYu Zhengdu recorded this in a little notebook. \u201cI mentioned those to Erica already. They\u2019re in progress right now. Later versions might have them.\u201dTo be more accurate, what they wanted to do was allow user accounts to automatically connect to their relations from the mortal realm.In the time that Yu Zhengdu had worked for Luofeng, he had discovered that there were a lot of problems with management in the Underworld as well. For example, many Underworld spirits would often become dangerous to society because they became isolated after death. Consequently, if it was possible to help them reunite with their friends and family from life \u2013 for example, as soon as their family members pa.s.sed away, they could receive an instant notification \u2013 to some degree, this could help maintain the safety and peace of the Underworld.\u201cThere\u2019s no need,\u201d Liu Wei replied in a daze. \u201cLeader, is WeChat not easy to use? Or is Weibo not fun enough?\u201dYu Zhengdu calmly patted his shoulder. \u201cYou need to have dreams.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Liu Wei shrugged and didn\u2019t dwell too much on it. After all, which programmer hadn\u2019t gotten harmed by a product manager before? It was fine as long as you got used to it. At least their Leader had technological skills too.Liu Wei continued on to say, \u201cThat Zhong Ka had another suggestion. He hoped that we could make the Good and Evil Scores and their obtainment conditions transparent. I think it\u2019s entirely possible, just like those game companies. To have customers use our app more, we need to make it as simple as possible and allow them to be capable of setting goals.\u201d\u201cIf we can make this section transparent, we would definitely be able to stimulate users to more actively complete missions, greatly increasing their time spent on the app\u2026\u2026\u201dThe more he spoke, the more excited Liu Wei became. He completely forgot how disdainful he had been of this silly app in the beginning.But Yu Zhengdu\u2019s response to this suggestion was slightly uninterested. \u201cWe can\u2019t do that.\u201dLiu Wei felt like he had been splashed by a cold bucket of water. He made a noise of surprise and asked, \u201cWhy? I think it\u2019s a good idea\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu smiled and patiently explained, \u201cDon\u2019t we often say \u2018don\u2019t not perform little acts of kindness because they are little, don\u2019t perform little acts of evil because they are little\u2019? Good acts and bad acts actually shouldn\u2019t be cla.s.sified as big or little, nor should they be quantified. If we publicized the conditions for attaining good and evil scores, it would definitely cause a group of users to do things only for this score. No one would perform small acts of kindness anymore, while people might feel that performing a small act of evil would be irrelevant because it was small. This isn\u2019t the original intention for the development of our Good and Evil Scores function.\u201dOne shouldn\u2019t ask what the background of a hero is, nor should they judge how great he is through the impact of his actions.But just as how the law also weighed things differently, human thought was complex. This was a practical problem. Even in the Underworld, it was impossible to fairly judge each Underworld spirit. Thus, the Life and Death Accounts\u2019 calculations for good and evil scores were actually very complex.The Underworld and mortal realms often a.s.sumed that \u201cbig\u201d acts of kindness meant a higher Good score. Actually, though, that didn\u2019t happen. Even if two different people did the same thing, oftentimes, because of the differences in circ.u.mstance, the weighted results would be different.Due to the same concept, the scores that corresponded with each reincarnation result couldn\u2019t be publicized either.In other words, the most important purpose of the\u3010Good and Evil Scores\u3011section, aside from making it easier for everyone to check that their important life events were right and to calculate the results for reincarnation, was to remind people to think kind thoughts often instead of completing certain acts to reach a goal.One should only do good things without considering rewards.After hearing this explanation, Liu Wei became deeply touched: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIn all honesty, he had originally thought that this app\u2019s market orientation was a death simulation game. Naturally, his trail of thought started following the logic of simulated games. He hadn\u2019t at all thought that Leader would have such n.o.ble aspirations in his heart.He actually wanted to use this app to communicate such a deep concept to the users?Liu Wei thought about it and seriously said, \u201cLeader, though I don\u2019t believe that our users will think this way, I still support you.\u201dThese days, it was very rare for people to be able to remember the original intentions for their actions. Though the results might not be ideal, those who worked endlessly for their dreams deserved respect.Yu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAs soon as he looked at Liu Wei\u2019s expression, he knew that this innocent tech homebody had gotten things wrong. Who knew how great of an image he now had in the other\u2019s heart.This wasn\u2019t a touching story about someone fighting the norms to rise and accomplish their dreams at all. It was truly only fulfilling the basic needs of work\u2026\u2026After they finished their conversation, Yu Zhengdu patted Liu Wei\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou need to stop working so much overtime. Look out for your health. Also, don\u2019t go touching Zheng Yan\u2019s stuff.\u201dLiu Wei nodded. When he got back to his own work station, he couldn\u2019t help remembering what had happened last night. Speaking of, he should\u2019ve added Zhong Ka on WeChat to continue their discussion. He thought about it and typed \u201cZhong Ka\u201d into the search bar online. Unexpectedly, the search results instantly shocked him immensely.The results page actually had several news links. They were all reporting on the same thing: a large scale multi-car accident on Desolate Mountain.And the name \u201cZhong Ka\u201d was in the victims list.Liu Wei: !!!!!!Liu Wei slapped the table and stood up. He shouted, \u201cLeader, our release candidate users are too much!\u201dYu Zhengdu hadn\u2019t gotten that far away yet. Upon hearing this, he came back and asked, \u201cWhat happened?\u201dLiu Wei pointed at the news and spoke, voice filled with indignance, \u201cHe actually stole a deceased victim\u2019s personal information to register for his account. Too unbecoming!\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu patted his shoulder. \u201cWork hard. You are very suited for our company.\u201d<b>The author has something to say:</b>Zhong Ka: I\u2019m a ghost.Liu Wei: No, you aren\u2019t.As long as you\u2019re scientific and materialist enough, ghosts aren\u2019t ghosts!Now everyone knows why Liu Wei\u2019s hair is so much thicker than everyone else\u2019s, right?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66 - Death ReplacementPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 66 - Death ReplacementThe Life Management app\u2019s internal testing continued smoothly. Luofeng\u2019s headquarters maintained close contact with each release candidate user and gathered several suggestions. Yu Zhengdu, Zhao Ruola, and the rest of the Amazing Future programmers also kept up a rapid pace fixing a few problems.The internal testing quickly drew close to its end. Meanwhile, it got closer and closer to the day the Life Management app would officially be released. Zhao Ruola was busy checking for and resolving bugs, while Yu Zhengdu was using this last bit of time to communicate with the Underworld users and report progress to Shang Que.This day, he was in the middle of a meeting with Shang Que at the Luofeng headquarters. Lu Lingxi suddenly knocked on his door and called for him, saying, \u201cXiao Yu, there\u2019s a new release candidate volunteer outside. He said that there\u2019s a serious bug in the app. We don\u2019t really understand this stuff either. How about you take a look?\u201dUpon hearing this, Yu Zhengdu immediately went on high alert. The app\u2019s release was quickly coming up. It was a big deal if a serious bug had appeared now. He turned to look at Shang Que. \u201cWe\u2019ll end here. I\u2019ll go check on that situation.\u201dShang Que nodded.Thus, Yu Zhengdu stood up and headed towards the reception room with Lu Lingxi. Following the steady increase in their company\u2019s sales, in addition to the release of the app, the Luofeng headquarters\u2019 office s.p.a.ce was starting to become not enough. As such, they also rented the office upstairs. Finally, they had an exclusive reception room.But, because they hadn\u2019t rented all these s.p.a.ces at the same time and because the technology park didn\u2019t always happen to have offices next door to each other to rent to them, currently, the headquarters and subsidiary company Amazing Future\u2019s offices were all over the place. They were spread out in different buildings of the technology park, making communication quite inconvenient.As Yu Zhengdu walked, he thought to himself,When he reached the reception room upstairs, Yu Zhengdu immediately saw a twenty-something year old youth sitting on the couch. Next to him was their coworker who often soaked his eyeb.a.l.l.s in water.Only to see their eyeball-soaking coworker holding a gla.s.s cup. In the cup was a single eyeball. Meanwhile, he was in the middle of digging out the other eyeball. As he did so, he explained, \u201cSee, like this. The angle your fingers enter must be slightly tilted, about seventy five degrees or so. It can\u2019t be perpendicular. If it\u2019s perpendicular, it\u2019s easy to stab your eyeb.a.l.l.s\u2026\u2026\u201dThe youth nodded very seriously.Eyeball-soaking coworker: \u201cAnd then, the removal process needs to be fast. Use your fingertips, not your fingernails. Otherwise, you\u2019ll damage your cornea.\u201dFollowing his words, the remaining eyeball fell out of its socket too. He caught it and threw it into the cup. \u201cGot it?\u201dThe youth started clapping with an enlightened expression. \u201cI\u2019ll try when I get home.\u201dEyeball-soaking coworker: \u201c . You need to practice hard. Practice makes perfect.\u201dYu Zhengdu\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201cWhat are you two doing?\u201dThe eyeball-soaking coworker held the gla.s.s cup out to him. The eyes in the cup turned to look at Yu Zhengdu. He said, \u201cOh, I\u2019m teaching him how to take his eyeb.a.l.l.s out.\u201dThe youth looked up too. He revealed a dumb smile, \u201cI just died, so don\u2019t really know many basics about how to be a ghost. I need to hurry and learn\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe wasn\u2019t sure if he should warn the other that this wasn\u2019t actually part of the basics for being a ghost.Yu Zhengdu walked over. He shook hands with the youth and said, \u201ch.e.l.lo, I\u2019m Luofeng\u2019s director of technical operations, Yu Zhengdu.\u201d\u201ch.e.l.lo, h.e.l.lo.\u201d The youth hurriedly held out his hand. \u201cMy name is Fan Li.\u201dAs he spoke, he looked Yu Zhengdu up and down, then stated in admiration, \u201cWow, you really look like a human\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu calmly replied, \u201cBecause I am a human.\u201dFan Li: \u201c\u2026\u2026??\u201dYu Zhengdu gave a simple explanation, causing Fan Li to exclaim in admiration once more, \u201cSeems like the Underworld has developed really quickly too. I just died and have already received a text message notifying me to download the Life Management app. And reincarnation can be self-service. That\u2019s truly too convenient.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201cYou just pa.s.sed away?\u201dFan Li nodded. \u201cYes, just this morning. My body\u2019s still in the hospital.\u201dUpon hearing this, Yu Zhengdu understood. To confirm the ability for all users to adjust to the app, the volunteers for the release candidate were selected from different populations. There were naturally plenty of spots for newly deceased spirits as well. The goal was to check how well new ghosts could accept and learn to use Underworld technology.He observed Fan Li for a moment. This new spirit looked quite young, so definitely couldn\u2019t have died from old age. Thus, he comforted, \u201cMy condolences.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not so bad.\u201d Fan Li scratched his head. \u201cActually, I felt more scared before death. Let me tell you, last night, I suddenly became gravely ill. I was truly panicked. Laying in the hospital bed and having so many doctors trying to save me was incredibly uncomfortable. I was really scared that I would die, but hadn\u2019t thought that I would still have a spirit after death. So, I\u2019ve already calmed down greatly now.\u201dHis eyes were filled with curiosity regarding his transformation into a ghost. He laughed and said, \u201cBesides, it\u2019s quite interesting once you get used to it. Like when I came over here. I didn\u2019t even need to pay to ride public transportation.\u201dYu Zhengdu nodded, then asked a bit more about his situation. After confirming that he was adjusting to the Underworld quite well, he finally questioned, \u201cMy coworker said you\u2019re here because there\u2019s a serious bug in the app?\u201d\u201cOh oh, right.\u201d Fan Li first clicked open the\u3010Ghost-al Information\u3011page before handing his phone over. \u201cMy time of death is wrong. Isn\u2019t it 2018 right now? But on the page, it says it\u2019s supposed to be 2078. That\u2019s too far off\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter saying this, he then clicked open the second page. \u201cThe Good and Evil Scores section is wrong too. I checked this \u2018Important Life Events\u2019 page and noticed that I haven\u2019t done a lot of the listed events. And, I\u2019m only twenty nine this year. Why are there events from after thirty\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu grabbed his phone and scrolled through the\u3010Important Life Events\u3011module. Upon looking at it, he immediately acknowledged that there really was a bug.This was because the page displayed several events from after 2018. After scrolling down further, the events actually continued until three years later, which was 2021.Fan Li pointed at the last thing listed on the page. Very regretfully, he said, \u201cLook, this even arranged a wife for me. I\u2019ve been single for 29 years, since the womb. How wonderful it would be if this was real. Who\u2019s Jin Yue?\u201dThe last event listed in Fan Li\u2019s \u201cImportant Life Events\u201d was from July 2021. He was supposed to get married to someone named \u201cJin Yue\u201d.Yu Zhengdu felt confused. He clicked open the\u3010Self-Service Reincarnation\u3011page too, only to see that all subjects displayed: Not yet scheduled.\u201cShould be a bug,\u201d Yu Zhengdu stated with furrowed brows. And a very serious bug at that. Otherwise, there wouldn\u2019t be so many different things going wrong. He apologetically told Fan Li, \u201cPlease wait a moment. Let me look into it.\u201d\u201cOkay, no problem.\u201d Fan Li was pretty mannerly. He didn\u2019t seem impatient at all. He rubbed his hands together and said, \u201cLet me first practice how to remove my eyeb.a.l.l.s.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu took Fan Li\u2019s phone back with him to his works.p.a.ce at Luofeng. He contacted Zhao Ruola and the two of them closely combed through the system\u2019s code once more. Then, they uploaded the question to the group chat of the development department, allowing all the programmers in the department to check too. In the blink of an eye, two hours had already pa.s.sed.When Shang Que walked over to Yu Zhengdu, he saw that the other\u2019s eyebrows were tightly furrowed. Yu Zhengdu was staring at the screen, extremely concentrated.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Shang Que asked. Yu Zhengdu had amazing skills and also knew many of the great masters in the field. Now, Zhao Ruola had joined them too. Whenever he had any technical problems, there were more than enough skilled people to discuss with. It was rare for him to appear so solemn.Yu Zhengdu turned to look at him, then slowly said, \u201cNothing\u2019s wrong.\u201dNothing was wrong. That was what was wrong.He explained Fan Li\u2019s situation, expression grim. \u201cI looked over the entire code from the development department again but didn\u2019t find a single thing wrong. Yet, the information displayed on Fan Li\u2019s app is without a doubt incorrect\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cLet me see.\u201d Shang Que reached a hand out and grabbed Fan Li\u2019s phone. After only taking a glance, his gaze became cold. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t reached his time to die yet.\u201dYu Zhengdu was lost. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201dShang Que handed the phone back. When he looked at Yu Zhengdu, his eyes became softer. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with your skills or code. It\u2019s just that this person hasn\u2019t reached his time of death yet. He should be able to live to 2078 and die of old age when he\u2019s 89.\u201d\u201cAnd for his \u2018Important Life Events\u2019 section, one of the Life and Death Accounts\u2019 functions is to make predictions based on past events. According to a person\u2019s past and present lives, it can predict someone\u2019s fate for their next life, then a.s.sign them to a reincarnation path and luck cla.s.sification. In concept, the Life and Death Accounts can calculate the consequences of someone\u2019s past decisions. Only, the world is ever changing and humanity is complex. From the moment they are born, each person\u2019s fate leaves the parameters of the Life and Death Accounts\u2019 calculations\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBut in actuality, he should still be alive. Thus, in his \u2018Important Life Events\u2019 section, the events of the next three years are still visible. This is the extent of the Life and Death Accounts\u2019 calculation capacity.\u201dOf course, these were only predictions under the most ideal conditions. In real life, the things about to occur to a person were often completely unpredictable, p.r.o.ne to changing in the blink of an eye.Yu Zhengdu remembered that the Life and Death Accounts computer system did include a model for the prediction of human fate. He couldn\u2019t help exclaiming, \u201cWow, does this count as big data fortune telling?\u201dShang Que: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d \u2026\u2026After being reminded of this, though, Yu Zhengdu became even more confused. \u201cBut Fan Li already died this morning\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que calmly answered, \u201cHis fate got switched by someone.\u201dYu Zhengdu instantly widened his eyes. \u201cSwitching fate?\u201d\u201c ,\u201d Shang Que nodded. He reached his palm out and gently hovered above the phone screen. A dim glow pa.s.sed over it. \u201cThis was just a cover-up.\u201dYu Zhengdu looked down and immediately noticed that the information on the page had already changed.\u3010Ghost-al Information\u3011Name: Fan Lis.e.x: MaleID number: *****************xTime of Death: x Hour, x Month, x Day, 2018Cause of Death: IllnessResidence in Life: 6 Third Factory Road, Egret District, Fu CityGrave Location: Yet to be buriedThen looking at his\u3010Good and Evil Scores\u3011page, the events listed in the \u201cImportant Life Events\u201d section had all completely transformed. Upon closer inspection, Yu Zhengdu inhaled sharply.This person whose name was also Fan Li had truly done a lot of bad things.He opened the backend server on his computer and pulled up Fan Li\u2019s Good and Evil Scores for further examination. The app\u2019s client server couldn\u2019t show details for the Good and Evil Scores, but the backend server could.As soon as he did so, he found, as expected, that this Fan Li\u2019s Evil Scores were shockingly high.\u201cTsk tsk tsk, a beast!\u201d Yu Zhengdu cussed while clicking open the\u3010Self-Service Reincarnation\u3011module. The page displayed an already scheduled time and place; he would be reincarnating into the b.e.s.t.i.a.l path.\u201cAs expected, a beast!\u201d Yu Zhengdu hummed coldly.After re-confirming this phone\u2019s phone number and the text message that had been sent by Luofeng\u2019s headquarters, they found that they were all in accordance with this new ID number and not the original Fan Li\u2019s ID number.Yu Zhengdu couldn\u2019t help being surprised. \u201cI hadn\u2019t expected that there would be such evil spells in the world.\u201d\u201cThere are. They were very plentiful in the past,\u201d Shang Que calmly explained.Since historic times, the cultivators of the mortal world were cultivating to be G.o.ds and to extend their lifetimes. Put in plain words, these were all just methods to avoid death. Only, most cultivators depended on the energy of the world and their own abilities to comprehend the Dao. However, there were still quite a few who had ultimately followed a wrong path, using evil spells to steal extended years of life.Switching fate was one of these spells.Switching fate was also called replacing fate. As the name suggested, it involved switching one\u2019s own fate with someone else\u2019s. There were several different types of this: the most common were switching health, switching wealth, and even switching intelligence.In folklore, many similar legends existed. Supposedly, people departed from their houses and picked up a packet of medicine or something of the like on the way. After returning home, they would fall ill. Upon being cured, their previously healthy body would never return to full health, rendering them incredibly weak. In such a story, the main character most likely had had their health fate switched. The medicine packet they had picked up was probably thrown there by someone with a terminal illness after they had cast a spell on it.And there were intelligent people who would have distant relatives visit their homes. After, that intelligent person would suddenly become impossibly dumb and muddleheaded, while the relatives\u2019 initially slow-witted child would become strangely cured and capable of testing into a good school. The endings of such stories often involved the originally intelligent person\u2019s family finding the evil object that their distant relatives had secretly hidden in their house.There were often mortals who believed they could get lucky. Switching fate wasn\u2019t rare, but this was Yu Zhengdu\u2019s first time encountering someone who had directly caused a death because of switching fate.\u201cThis is a death replacement,\u201d Shang Que said.Actually, in history, death replacements were fairly common. Many cultivators relied on the fact that they could cast strong spells to steal and kill. Upon breaking the Heavenly Laws, their extended life would be taken away. But that wasn\u2019t all. Their true punishment would only start after they reached h.e.l.l. However, such cultivators were often also capable of seeing Heavenly intent. Thus, they would do everything in their power to avoid divine punishment.Finding a death replacement was one of the most common methods of doing so. In the h.e.l.l of the past, checking for death replacements was a frequent part of work. This was also why there were so many folk stories about people coming back to life after ghosts took the wrong spirits or ordered the wrong people to die.Yu Zhengdu fell into deep thought. \u201cSo all those stories in the past about ghost envoys capturing the wrong spirit aren\u2019t because of mindless error?\u201d\u201cSome are, some aren\u2019t,\u201d Shang Que explained. \u201cHave you noticed that in the stories of the ghost envoys catching the wrong spirit, most of the time the spirit has the same name and is from the same village as the deceased?\u201dYu Zhengdu\u2019s eyebrows shot up. He looked at the app again, where the information from someone else named \u201cFan Li\u201d was displayed. He asked, \u201cIt can\u2019t be that he specially changed his name?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a possibility,\u201d Shang Que answered. \u201cIf one is lucky enough, they\u2019ll be able to find someone who has the same name and surname as them and whose birthdate is also close enough to theirs to be their death replacement. But most of the time, the spellcaster is the one who first changes their own name, then tries to fool the Heavens and h.e.l.l.\u201dFinding a death replacement meant lying to the G.o.ds of the Heavens and ghosts of h.e.l.l. This was an incredibly difficult spell that required an extremely high cultivation level. Since the collapse of the Heavens and Earth and the decline of energy in the world, practically no cultivators had been able to reach such a level. The Luofeng of present times obviously no longer designated people to specifically check for death replacements.Speaking of, this was also because the person who had found Fan Li to be their death replacement had bad luck. When Luofeng had still been using text messages to notify Underworld spirits about reincarnation, the youth who had been forced to become a death replacement, Fan Li, would probably not realize that his time of death and important life events didn\u2019t match up. It was very likely that he would\u2019ve confusedly replaced the Fan Li that should\u2019ve died and reincarnated into the b.e.s.t.i.a.l path.But coincidentally, this was during Luofeng\u2019s internal testing for their app. Spirits could check the details of their important life events through the app, allowing the young Fan Li to immediately realize something was wrong.And also coincidentally, Shang Que was currently in charge of h.e.l.l. The Ghost King of Luofeng could easily see through this cover-up.\u201cThen what about death replacement Fan Li?\u201d Yu zhengdu asked angrily. \u201cHe has to die just like that? He\u2019s so innocent though?\u201d\u201cHow long has he been dead?\u201d Shang Que asked.Yu Zhengdu answered, \u201cHe just died this morning.\u201dShang Que pondered for a moment. \u201cHe has yet to reach the end of his predestined life. After the spirit leaves the body, within twenty four hours, the area over the heart is still warm. He can still come back to life.\u201dYu Zhengdu clenched his hand into a fist. \u201cThen let\u2019s hurry up. We need to be quick and save him.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67 - Ghost Calling a SpiritPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 67 - Ghost Calling a SpiritYu Zhengdu gave Fan Li a brief explanation of the situation. Then, he and Shang Que took Fan Li\u2019s spirit with them and rushed to the hospital.Along the way, Fan Li was still a bit bewildered. He couldn\u2019t stop asking, \u201cEy, I really haven\u2019t died yet?\u201d\u201cHard to say. Depends on if your body is still there or not,\u201d Yu Zhengdu stated. \u201cIf your family acts fast and has already cremated you, then you\u2019ll be forced to remain dead.\u201d\u201cThat can\u2019t be. Don\u2019t novels frequently write about how when the wrong people die and are about to come back to life but their bodies are already decomposed, h.e.l.l will arrange for them to resurrect into a fresh corpse nearby?\u201d Fan Li asked.Shang Que: \u201c , previously, borrowing a corpse to come back to life did occur.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s real?!\u201d Fan Li instantly started daydreaming happily. \u201cThen if my body can\u2019t be used anymore, can you guys arrange for me to possess a tall, rich, handsome instead? It would be best if he could have a beautiful girlfriend too\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que drawled out, \u201cThat practice has long since been restricted by the law.\u201dQuestion marks popped up above Fan Li\u2019s head. \u201c\u2026\u2026This stuff can be r-restricted by the law?\u201dYu Zhengdu, however, instantly understood. \u201cThis truly should be restricted. Otherwise, what if someone woke up one day and randomly started saying they were the deceased dad of the richest person on the planet come back to life? Everything would be a mess.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s exactly the idea,\u201d Shang Que nodded.In the early years, there were plenty of people in the mortal realm who had pretended to be spirits come back to life through other bodies to take over other people\u2019s wealth and wives. Dealing with such cases gave officials headaches too. During Emperor s.h.i.+zong of Jin \u2019s rule, a case about Xi\u2019er from Liangxiang County borrowing the corpse of Zhang He from Wanping County for resurrection found its way to the Shangshu Department . Ultimately, Emperor s.h.i.+zong decided, \u201cThe government is in charge of judging cases based on physical bodies and not spirits. That which is physical has evidence, but spirits do not.\u201dMeanwhile, the normal officials had actually reached an agreement much earlier on. Everything in the mortal realm should be based off a physical body, not a spirit.Following this, the Underworld also created a law in accordance that banned the practice of borrowing bodies for resurrection.\u201cA pity.\u201d Fan Li sounded very regretful. \u201cSeems like my death-to-instant-riches dream has been shattered.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019m just joking. I actually still want to resurrect into my own body quite a bit,\u201d Fan Li said. After all, the ones he couldn\u2019t bear to part with the most in the mortal realm were his parents and relatives.After completing this thought, Fan Li became uncontrollably angry. He asked, \u201cWho could be so evil? Daring to harm me like this!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s uncertain,\u201d Yu Zhengdu said. He thought about the switching fate methods Shang Que had brought up and came up with an idea. He asked again, \u201cHave you encountered any strange people during this period of time?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Fan Li went over his memories in detail. \u201cI only travel the same path between two locations every day. I don\u2019t even have time to get to know a possible girlfriend, much less strange people\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que suddenly spoke up, \u201cWhat about your neighbors?\u201dWith this reminder, Fan Li really did think of something. \u201cAh, right. The owner of the apartment below mine lives out of the country. They asked an agent to rent it out. I think a new renter happened to move in last month, but we\u2019ve never even seen each other before\u2026\u2026\u201dHe asked curiously, \u201cBut what does this have to do with my neighbors?\u201dYu Zhengdu instantly figured it out. He said, \u201cI understand. Is this similar to when police go to arrest someone but need to confirm the name and address? If they have the same name and the addresses are similar, the probability of arresting the wrong person is increased?\u201dFan Li widened his eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s such a concept?\u201dShang Que: \u201c\u2026\u2026You could also put it like that.\u201dHe said, \u201cIf the new renter is the other Fan Li, he probably placed a guiding talisman in your house. This way, he could guide the fate that should originally be his onto you.\u201dFan Li looked completely lost. \u201cWhat\u2019s that\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que didn\u2019t bother explaining further. If Fan Li had known what a guiding talisman was, he also wouldn\u2019t have had his fate so easily switched by someone.As they spoke, they reached the hospital Fan Li had been taken to. Fortunately, Fan Li\u2019s corpse was still in the ICU room and hadn\u2019t been sent for cremation yet.Because Fan Li had suddenly fallen extremely ill last night, the doctors had tried to save him for the entire night. After stabilizing his condition with great difficulty, they had sent him to an ICU room in the morning. But unexpectedly, his vitals took an abrupt downturn. Eventually, his heart stopped beating and he was declared as dead.Fan Li\u2019s parents had watched with wide eyes as their originally alive and energetic son died out of the blue. They temporarily couldn\u2019t handle such a shock, especially Fan Li\u2019s mother. She held onto his body and refused to let go for anything, adamant that the doctors continue trying to save him.Initially, according to the hospital\u2019s rules, after death, patients\u2019 bodies needed to be immediately sent to the morgue. However, Mother Fan stayed by his side, refusing to let them take him away, which wasted some time. After, the doctor discovered something strange. According to usual circ.u.mstances, rigor mortis would start to set in about one to two hours after an adult pa.s.sed away. Yet, Fan Li\u2019s body maintained a normal condition. Even the spot over his heart was still faintly warm.Because of this out of the ordinary phenomenon, in addition to the fact that Fan Li was staying in a one-person room \u2013 meaning that his presence wouldn\u2019t be disturbing anyone, the hospital\u2019s att.i.tude was no longer so strict. The doctor gave them an additional observation period.Unfortunately, though he had stayed in the room for an additional half a day, Fan Li\u2019s vitals remained unchanged. And, the original warmth faintly emanating from his body was slowly disappearing as time went by. As such, the hospital could only cla.s.sify this case as a unique one in which rigor mortis was setting in unusually slowly.Mother and Father Fan ultimately weren\u2019t unreasonable people. After being faced with the fact that their son had already stopped breathing and that he no longer had a heartbeat, in addition to all the diagnosis reports from the hospital, they couldn\u2019t help but accept this reality, even though it was extremely difficult to do so.With Fan Li\u2019s spirit leading the way, Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que made their way to his ICU room.\u201cUncle, Auntie, h.e.l.lo.\u201d Yu Zhengdu walked in after knocking on the door.Because Fan Li\u2019s death had been confirmed, all the medical staff had already left. Only Fan Li\u2019s parents remained with the body, saying their last goodbyes.When Yu Zhengdu and them pushed open the door, they saw Mother Fan kneeling by the bed. Both her hands clutched onto Fan Li\u2019s hand, unwilling to let go. Tear tracks covered her face; her eyes were impossibly red. It was obvious that she had just cried a lot.Father Fan, on the other hand, was sitting in a chair off to the side. He cradled his head in both hands, as if trying to hold up his quivering body.\u201cDad\u2014\u2014 Mom\u2014\u2014\u201d Upon seeing how his parents looked, Fan Li\u2019s nose soured too. He shouted in despair.But his parents couldn\u2019t hear his shouts. They could only hear Yu Zhengdu\u2019s voice.Father and Mother Fan looked up together in the direction of the door. Upon seeing two young men randomly standing there, they seemed perplexed. Father Fan asked in a hoa.r.s.e voice, \u201cWho are you?\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201cWe\u2019re Fan Li\u2019s friends. We heard he was sick, so specially came to visit him.\u201dHis excuse was actually extremely poor. Fan Li had suddenly fallen ill. Even his parents had been unprepared. How could his friends have found out that he was sick?But Fan Li had pa.s.sed away too suddenly, causing his parents to be in great shock. Their brains had practically stopped working. In that moment, they had no energy to take this into consideration.\u201cOh, it\u2019s Xiao Li\u2019s friends . You\u2019re quite kind.\u201d As she spoke, Mother Fan stood up. However, because she had knelt for too long, her feet were numb. She almost sprained her ankle, causing her to shout in shock.\u201cBe careful, Auntie.\u201d Yu Zhengdu hurriedly took a step forward to help hold her up.\u201cThank you.\u201d Mother Fan sat down with his help, but started crying once more. \u201cUnfortunately you guys are too late. Xiao Li has already, already\u2026\u2026\u201dShe ultimately couldn\u2019t finish her sentence. It was Father Fan who added on from the side, \u201cXiao Li has already died.\u201dYu Zhengdu made eye contact with Shang Que. He couldn\u2019t say too much, so only asked, \u201cUncle, Auntie, then can we see Fan Li?\u201d\u201cGo ahead, go ahead.\u201d Father Fan waved his hand while looking completely devastated. \u201cHis body is going to be taken away soon. Just consider it as your last time seeing him.\u201dYu Zhengdu and Shang Que walked up to the bed, only to see Fan Li\u2019s corpse quietly laying there. His eyes were closed and his face was a bloodless pale. There wasn\u2019t anything about him that seemed alive.\u201cI look so at peace,\u201d Fan Li\u2019s spirit suddenly said.Yu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe quietly rushed, \u201cHurry and go back.\u201dFan Li rubbed his chin and asked sincerely, \u201cHow do I go back? Do I just lie down?\u201dThis was his knowledge blind spot. Yu Zhengdu naturally turned to look at Shang Que.\u201c .\u201d Shang Que reached a hand out and lightly tapped the spot between Fan Li\u2019s eyebrows. He softly said, \u201cTime of death has not been reached; allowed to return to life.\u201dFollowing his voice, Fan Li\u2019s expression slowly became transfixed. \u201cAh, I can feel the oxygen!\u201dShang Que expressionlessly stated, \u201cLie down.\u201d\u201cOkay, then I\u2019ll go back now.\u201d As he spoke, Fan Li crawled onto the bed. He continued muttering, \u201cDo I need to aim? Or is any position okay? If I lie down face first will I be a backwards-man when I come back to life?\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que emotionlessly pressed him down. \u201cWhatever.\u201d\u201cAh ah ah, I\u2019m crooked.\u201d Fan Li\u2019s spirit yelled as he flopped onto his body. A while later, he vigorously performed a sit-up and shot straight up. Then, he lifted a hand, followed by a foot. \u201cWhat happened what happened? Did I resurrect?\u201dOnly to see that his raised hand and foot were still spiritual. They were completely separate from his physical body.\u201cYi? I haven\u2019t.\u201d Fan Li discovered this problem. He scratched his head in bewilderment. \u201cWas my position wrong?\u201dUpon seeing this, Yu Zhengdu was very confused too. He softly asked Shang Que, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cSomeone did something to his body.\u201d Shang Que slightly furrowed his brows. \u201cThat person was very careful. Not only did he switch their fates, he also made sure that Fan Li\u2019s spirit wouldn\u2019t be able to return to his body.\u201dAfter hearing this, Fan Li cupped his face in terror. \u201cThen what should I do? Does that mean I can\u2019t be resurrected?\u201dShang Que ignored him, only explaining to Yu Zhengdu, \u201cAll we have to do is find what he did.\u201dShang Que had a brief understanding of these evil methods. Only, different people used different methods. He needed to look over the entire body to be certain.\u201cHow are we supposed to do that?\u201d Yu Zhengdu found this situation slightly difficult. He glanced at Father and Mother Fan out of the corner of his eye and whispered, \u201cIf we dared to touch his body, wouldn\u2019t his parents kick us out?\u201dFan Li said, \u201cI think you guys won\u2019t even need to touch me. My parents are already starting to suspect you.\u201dAs expected, probably because they had stayed too long beside the body, Father and Mother Fan regained their wits. Their gazes seemed filled with the beginnings of suspicion as they fell on Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que. Father Fan asked, \u201cOh right, young men. We haven\u2019t asked which friends of Xiao Li you are. How come we haven\u2019t seen you before?\u201dYu Zhengdu instantly knew things were going downhill after hearing this question. This beginning often indicated that someone was suspicious. Fan Li\u2019s spirit was on scene with them, so it wouldn\u2019t be hard to come up with matching testimonies, but with Father and Mother Fan\u2019s eyes locked on them, it would be impossible to do anything to Fan Li\u2019s corpse.Just as Yu Zhengdu was considering whether or not to tell Father and Mother Fan the truth \u2013 and whether or not they would believe this truth \u2013 the door to the room got opened once more. A worker wearing a hospital uniform and a mask walked in. In a low, m.u.f.fled voice, he told Father and Mother Fan, \u201cYou guys have already wasted enough time. The deceased can\u2019t continue to take up a room. I\u2019m here to send him to the morgue.\u201dFather and Mother Fan knew too that the hospital had already been extremely generous to them. Now, they couldn\u2019t keep being stubborn. Mother Fan covered her mouth and leaned against Father Fan\u2019s shoulder. Father Fan could only heave out a long sigh. He waved his hand at that person. \u201cWe\u2019ve troubled you. You can take him away.\u201dThat person nodded and walked toward Fan Li\u2019s bed. Only now did he notice that there were two other people in the room. Thus, he instinctively glanced at them.At the same time, Shang Que told Yu Zhengdu in a whisper, \u201cHe\u2019s the one who switched fates with Fan Li.\u201dYu Zhengdu was slightly shocked. \u201cHow do you know?\u201dShang Que revealed a cold smile. \u201cAn air of death is emanating off of his body.\u201dThough he had found someone to die for him, his body had already reached the end of its life. Mortals couldn\u2019t tell, but Shang Que could see that air of death on him.Yu Zhengdu instantly came to a realization. \u201cIs he here to confirm if Fan Li\u2019s dead or not?\u201dShang Que nodded. \u201c .\u201dThis was something that many who found death replacements couldn\u2019t resist doing. Only after confirming that the person who had replaced their death had truly and completely died, with no other chance of resurrection, could they truly relax.Shang Que was a bit excited. \u201cHow wonderful that he\u2019s revealed himself. Let me beat him up\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu hurriedly stopped him. \u201cWait a moment.\u201dShang Que was perplexed, only to see Yu Zhengdu give Fan Li\u2019s spirit a meaningful look. He mouthed, \u201cGo face him.\u201dIt turned out that after that person entered the room, though he was confused as to why there were suddenly two other people inside, he was actually more interested in checking on Fan Li\u2019s situation. So, he ignored the people around him and headed straight to Fan Li\u2019s bedside. However, his movements seemed a bit strange. He very purposefully showed his back to Yu Zhengdu and them, blocking their field of vision completely.A pity. He could cover mortals\u2019 lines of sight, but couldn\u2019t prevent a ghost from simply standing in front of him and watching.Fan Li stood directly facing that person, not bothering to hide at all. He watched the other\u2019s actions while using an extremely exaggerated tone of voice to give Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que a live rundown.\u201cf.u.c.k!\u201d Fan Li\u2019s eyes were as round as circles. He pointed at that person and loudly shouted, \u201cHe pulled a needle out of my nose!\u201d\u201cThis long\u2014\u2014\u201d Fan Li pointed to his index finger. \u201cf.u.c.k, when did he stick it in? Too evil!\u201dShang Que nodded as if he had expected this. \u201cHe was sealing off that aperture.\u201dThe supposed sealing off of apertures entailed using silver needles to seal off the seven apertures of a corpse. If the seven apertures weren\u2019t unblocked, the spirit wouldn\u2019t be able to return to its body.\u201cI understand now.\u201d Yu Zhengdu fell into thought. \u201cSeems like not only does he want to check and see if Fan Li is dead or not, but he\u2019s also here to destroy any evidence.\u201dFan Li had originally been saved last night; his condition had even stabled. That person had probably been scared that things would change, so had dressed as a member of the hospital staff and entered the room during a time that n.o.body else had been in the room. He had sealed off Fan Li\u2019s seven apertures, causing Fan Li to suddenly die this morning.Now, after confirming that Fan Li had truly died, he naturally needed to remove these needles to prevent the truth from becoming exposed.Fan Li stood next to him, watching this person yank a needle out of his nose. In a fit of anger, he made to hit the other.At the same time, Shang Que reached a hand out and tapped. \u201cSpirit Fan Li\u2019s time of death has not been reached; allowed to return to life.\u201dFan Li\u2019s spiritual fist had just pa.s.sed through that person\u2019s head when, with a sound of \u201cAh\u2014\u2014\u201d, his entire soul uncontrollably fell into his physical body.The next second, his physical body\u2019s eyelids fluttered open. He made direct eye contact with that person who was pretending to be a hospital worker.Fan Li: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThat person: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThat person\u2019s eyes instantly widened. He unconsciously shouted, \u201cYou\u2019re not dead??!!\u201dStill in a daze, Fan Li propped his head up. His gaze was extremely lost. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me?\u201dTo humans, the spirit leaving the body was like a dream: an adventure through the Underworld that ended after the person came back to life, just as someone would wake from a night of dreams.Fan Li woke up from this long sleep and felt completely lost, as if he had entered an extremely long and complicated dream. After being shouted at, that dreamlike scene instantly disappeared.He could only faintly remember something, but not anything specific.These two people\u2019s voices were like a clap of thunder in an otherwise silent environment. Father and Mother Fan had originally been dismally waiting for their son\u2019s corpse to get taken away when suddenly, they heard these two sentences. They instantly jumped in place and charged over. \u201cXiao Li!!!\u201d\u201cXiao Li!!! Is that you talking?!!\u201dAfter seeing that Fan Li had truly opened his eyes, the Fan parents were in complete disbelief. They immediately pushed that staff member away and threw themselves in front of their son. Mother Fan instantly grabbed Fan Li\u2019s hand, expression ecstatic. \u201cYou\u2019ve woken up? You\u2019ve really woken up?!\u201d\u201cHurry and call a doctor, hurry!\u201d Father Fan still retained a bit of logical thinking. He excitedly pressed on the alarm, then ran to the door and yelled, \u201cDoctor! Doctor\u2014\u2014 Hurry and come take a look! My son woke up!\u201dRushed footsteps sounded from outside the door. Upon seeing that Father Fan had already alerted almost the whole hospital, the one whose death had been replaced became scared of being exposed. With no more energy to confirm whether or not Fan Li had died, he quickly ran out of the room while Father and Mother Fan were focused on Fan Li.Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que looked at each other and silently followed.The one whose death had been replaced was probably shocked out of his mind. The entire way, his stride was panicked, making him appear moments away from falling over.Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que followed behind him, quite relaxed and confident.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem all that brave,\u201d Yu Zhengdu said with disdain. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t scared when he was murdering someone, but after seeing that person come back to life, he\u2019s so terrified.\u201dShang Que: \u201cBecause Fan Li has come back to life. That means he has to die.\u201dYu Zhengdu\u2019s expression was dark. \u201cDoesn\u2019t seem to me like he\u2019s about to die soon. See how energetically he\u2019s running?\u201dShang Que suddenly turned to look at him. \u201cHave you heard of \u2018ghost calling a spirit\u2019?\u201dYu Zhengdu shook his head.Thus, Shang Que turned back around and gazed at that person\u2019s back. He slowly called out, \u201cFan Li.\u201dOnly to see that person pause in his motions and reflexively turn around to look, directly meeting Shang Que\u2019s eyes.Those close to the end of their lives shouldn\u2019t, under any circ.u.mstances, turn around upon hearing a ghost calling their name. As soon as they turned around, their spirit would immediately get taken away.Only to see that person widen his eyes abruptly. The next moment, he clenched the spot above his heart and slowly fell onto the ground.\u201cSave me\u2014\u2014\u201d With a twisted expression, he reached a hand out to try and tug at the pa.s.sersby. He shouted with extreme difficulty, \u201cSave me\u2014\u2014\u201dThe people around him discovered something was wrong. Immediately, doctors and nurses started charging over. In a flurry of motion, they carried him into the emergency room. The scene was a complete mess.Shang Que said, \u201cThis is \u2018ghost calling a spirit\u2019.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d<b>The author has something to say:</b>Yu Zhengdu: Boss, in the future, unless it\u2019s for actual business, please don\u2019t call me.Shang Que: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68 - The Future That Got Seen Ahead of TimePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 68 - The Future That Got Seen Ahead of TimeThe sudden reawakening of the youth, Fan Li, shocked the entire hospital. All the hospital\u2019s medical professionals and doctors held a consultation. In the end, they determined that Fan Li truly was fine now. Though his body was still a bit weak, the sudden illness that had previously occurred was noticeably gone, no longer a risk for his health.The chief physician was incredibly perplexed, but given the situation that no errors could be discovered in the vitals, he could only declare Fan Li\u2019s previous condition as a state of \u201cfake death\u201d. Such occurrences were extremely rare, but had been recorded before.To Fan Li\u2019s parents, the general reason wasn\u2019t important. What was important was that Fan Li had come back to life after dying. That was the best news.Another symptom that appeared, though, was Fan Li\u2019s muddled state of mind in the first few days after he woke up. He continuously mentioned the strange dreams he had experienced when ill to his parents. Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t have very clear memories of them, only some images that were hard to describe. Sometimes, he would also do weird things: for example, try to pop out his eyeb.a.l.l.s.A medical reason couldn\u2019t be found for this situation either. The doctor could only guess that this was a nervous system malfunction that had appeared after his recovery. He also suggested to Fan Li\u2019s parents to observe him carefully in order to prevent him from actually popping his eyeb.a.l.l.s out or doing other self-destructive things.Because Fan Li\u2019s situation was very special, even though there were no anomalies found in his full body checkup, the hospital still kept him under observation for a period of time.A few days later, after Fan Li\u2019s mind had completely cleared up, he finally left under the guidance of his parents.Only now did the Fan parents completely recover. They relaxed and had the energy to go over the events that had occurred during Fan Li\u2019s sickness.With this, they discovered something strange.\u201cOh right, Xiao Li. When you were sick, two people who said they were your friends came to visit you. Remember to say thanks to them,\u201d Mother Fan said.Father Fan made a noise of suspicion. \u201cNow that you\u2019ve mentioned it, I remember too. How come those two young men disappeared later on? Shouldn\u2019t they have stayed around since Xiao Li came back to life?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d With this reminder, Mother Fan remembered something even stranger. \u201cSpeaking of, Xiao Li fell ill quite suddenly. We didn\u2019t even have time to tell anybody else. How did those two young men find out?\u201dThe two of them exchanged glances and saw br.i.m.m.i.n.g doubt in each other\u2019s eyes.Father Fan especially couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it. Those two people had seemed out of the ordinary. If they were really Fan Li\u2019s friends, how come he didn\u2019t ever remember meeting them? Additionally, the timing of their appearance was too coincidental. Even more coincidentally, mere moments after they appeared, Fan Li mysteriously came back to life.These events seemed to suggest that perhaps those two people\u2019s ident.i.ties weren\u2019t normal.Father Fan felt more and more frightful as he reasoned to himself. Then, he heard Mother Fan asked Fan Li, \u201cXiao Li, were those two people really your friends?\u201dFan Li was confused. \u201cWho are you talking about?\u201d\u201cWe forgot to ask for their names,\u201d Mother Fan said. \u201cBut they looked like this\u2026\u2026\u201dMother Fan used all of her language skills to describe Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que\u2019s appearances. It was fortunate that their looks were truly above average; consequently, though they hadn\u2019t spent much time together, Mother Fan could still describe them perfectly. In between, she added several subjective descriptors such as \u201ctoo good looking\u201d, \u201ctoo handsome\u201d, 'such wonderful auras\u201d, etc.Father Fan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Just like that. Say, how come you never mentioned that you had such good looking friends?\u201d Mother Fan concluded.\u201cEmmm.\u201d Fan Li rubbed his chin and fell deep into thought.Upon seeing this, Father Fan felt that half of his theories had been confirmed. He nervously asked, \u201cWhat is it? You don\u2019t know them?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019ve seen them before.\u201d Fan Li scratched his head and said, \u201cI remembered as soon as Mom described them. I know them and even met up with them recently, I think. But I can\u2019t remember who they are. My memory seems to have become subpar since my illness\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201d Father Fan froze. \u201cIs that so.\u201dOnly to see Mother Fan forcefully hit Fan Li\u2019s arm twice. \u201cAiyo, you rascal. How could you forget such handsome friends just like that?!!\u201dFather Fan: \u201ck2026;k2026;\u201dAs they spoke, they reached their neighborhood. Coincidentally, they encountered a few neighbors chatting in the activity area downstairs.After seeing that they were back, the neighbors immediately greeted, \u201cLao Fan, you guys are finally back. How\u2019s Xiao Li?\u201d\u201cFine, fine. See, he\u2019s alive and kicking,\u201d Father Fan replied with a smile. He then asked curiously, \u201cWhat are you guys all gathered here talking about?\u201d\u201cEy, you haven\u2019t been home for a long time so probably don\u2019t know yet, right? Something big happened.\u201d A neighbor walked closer and dramatically announced, \u201cSomething happened in Lao Jin\u2019s place, the one downstairs of you guys.\u201d\u201cLao Jin\u2019s apartment?\u201d Father Fan thought about it. \u201cDidn\u2019t it get rented out by a property agent?\u201dThe neighbor: \u201cExactly, something happened to the renter. Apparently, a few days ago, the renter had a sudden heart attack at the hospital. They tried to save him on the spot, but to no avail. He died that same day. The property agent only heard this news two days ago and finally got in contact with Lao Jin\u2026\u2026\u201dFather Fan was shocked. \u201cSuch an event is possible?\u201d\u201cI know right.\u201d The neighbor sighed. \u201cQuite fortunate he didn\u2019t have his heart attack in Lao Jin\u2019s apartment. Otherwise, Lao Jin would have it real bad.\u201dThe group chatted a bit more. Mother Fan couldn\u2019t help reminding from off to the side, \u201cAlright, have your conversation another day. Xiao Li just got out of the hospital. He needs to get back home and rest.\u201dThe neighbor hurriedly nodded. \u201cRight right right. Xiao Li\u2019s rest is more important.\u201dThe Fan family of three walked into the elevator. Mother Fan couldn\u2019t keep herself from muttering, \u201cEy, is there some fengshui problem with our building? How come the renter downstairs had a heart attack too\u2026\u2026\u201dIt was necessary to mention that the severe illness that had almost killed Fan Li was also a sudden heart attack.Father Fan\u2019s expression was slightly dark. \u201cAlright, stop talking about it. Might bring misfortune.\u201dOn the other hand, Fan Li was quite unbothered. Uncaringly, he said, \u201cAren\u2019t you guys overthinking it? We\u2019ve already lived here for over a decade. If there was anything wrong with the fengshui, something bad would\u2019ve happened long ago!\u201dFan Li\u2019s words allowed his parents to relax a little. He was right. Fengshui issues couldn\u2019t appear out of the blue. It was probably all just a coincidence.The three of them reached their floor. As soon as they exited the elevator, they noticed a girl standing in front of their door. She was in the middle of poking something into their keyhole.Fan Li instantly widened his eyes. He shouted, \u201cWho are you? Why are you opening my door? Are you trying to rob me?!\u201dThe girl jumped in fright. She turned around. The thing in her hand fell on the ground with a clink. It was a key.The girl looked at their family, perplexed. \u201cIsn\u2019t this my apartment?\u201dFan Li: \u201c\u2026\u2026I think you have the wrong place.\u201dUpon hearing this, the girl looked up at the number placard, then made a sound of realization. She hurriedly apologized, \u201cMy apologies. I got the floor wrong. My apartment is downstairs.\u201dFather Fan asked after hearing this, \u201cDownstairs? You\u2019re the new renter?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m the owner.\u201d The girl nodded towards Mother and Father Fan and explained, \u201cI\u2019m the Jin family\u2019s daughter. I just returned from overseas for work and was originally going to take the apartment back to stay in myself. I hadn\u2019t expected for something to happen to the renter, so after dealing with that issue over these past few days, I finally have time to clean up the place today.\u201d\u201cOh oh, so you\u2019re Lao Jin\u2019s daughter,\u201d Mother Fan instantly greeted with a smile. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten so big!\u201dThe daughter of their neighbor downstairs, Lao Jin, had been sent abroad at a very young age to get a foreign education. A few years ago, Lao Jin\u2019s whole family had moved out of the country too. Because of this, many of their neighbors didn\u2019t know what Lao Jin\u2019s daughter looked like.Fan Li thought about how he had scared the other. He hurriedly introduced himself, \u201cSo sorry about just now. We\u2019re your upstairs neighbors. I\u2019m Fan Li.\u201d\u201ch.e.l.lo.\u201d The girl shook hands with him and said, \u201cI\u2019m Jin Yue.\u201d\u201cJin Yue?!\u201d Only to see Fan Li\u2019s eyes instantly widen. He reflexively said, \u201cIsn\u2019t that the name of my future wife?\u201dJin Yue: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dFan Li\u2019s parents: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dFather Fan looked extremely embarra.s.sed. He scolded, \u201cRascal! Where did you learn such pick up lines?!\u201dMother Fan was angry too. She smacked him and said, \u201cI normally urge you to get a girlfriend but you always say you don\u2019t know how. How come you can act like a hooligan with Lao Jin\u2019s daughter, huh?\u201dFan Li dodged while innocently saying, \u201cI\u2019m telling the truth . I remember I saw somewhere before that my future wife\u2019s name is Jin Yue\u2026\u2026\u201dMother Fan was so embarra.s.sed she couldn\u2019t bear to keep listening. She grabbed him by the ear and towed him back, all the while furiously apologizing to Jin Yue. \u201cXiao Jin, my apologies. Our rascal of a son has never had a girlfriend before. He\u2019s dumb to an extreme. When he sees pretty girls, he forgets how to speak\u2026\u2026\u201dJin Yue hurriedly mediated, \u201cIt\u2019s not an issue. I know he\u2019s only joking\u2026\u2026\u201dUpon finis.h.i.+ng their apologies, the Fan parents immediately unlocked their door. Father Fan said, \u201cSince Xiao Jin\u2019s going to be living here again in the future, we\u2019re all neighbors. Come in and sit.\u201dAs he spoke, Father Fan pushed Fan Li. \u201cHurry and get in, you. So embarra.s.sing.\u201dFan Li was still feeling wronged about how he had told the truth but had been misunderstood by everyone. After being pushed out of the blue, he lost his balance and crashed into the door, only to hear a loud . The big door shook and a yellow piece of paper drifted down from above.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Mother Fan picked up the yellow piece of paper. The texture of the paper was extremely strange. She couldn\u2019t tell what material it was made out of. There were also bizarre designs drawn onto it with red ink.\u201cI think this is a talisman?\u201d Mother Fan asked with furrowed brows.Fan Li glanced at it, unbothered. \u201cYou think talismans as weird as this one exist?\u201dEveryone crowded around the piece of paper, observing it, but no one could make heads or tails of it. Fan Li scratched his head. \u201cIt probably got blown in from somewhere?\u201dThis type of paper was incredibly light. It could\u2019ve travelled here from anywhere.Father Fan still felt a bit wary. He couldn\u2019t describe exactly why, though. After some thought, he said, \u201cSo unusual and strange. I\u2019d better burn it to be safe.\u201dThe Fan parents walked in first with the yellow paper. They set out to find a lighter to burn it. This left Fan Li and Jin Yue alone.Now, Fan Li finally realized that his words previously had been quite impolite. Thus, he softly apologized to Jin Yue, \u201cXiao Jin , I didn\u2019t say that your name is the same as the name of my future wife on purpose. I just really have such a memory\u2026\u2026 Ey, don\u2019t misunderstand. I wasn\u2019t teasing you, I just\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cNo worries.\u201d Jin Yue waved her hands. \u201cThere are too many coincidences in this world. I understand.\u201dShe pondered a bit before scooting closer to Fan Li. She whispered, \u201cJust now, I felt too shy to say this aloud and was also scared that your parents would be unhappy. But actually, I got shocked after hearing your name too.\u201dFan Li\u2019s heart skipped a beat. He couldn\u2019t help the corners of his lips from quirking up in excitement. \u201cWhat? Could it be that your future husband has the same name as mine?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Jin Yue rubbed her hands together. She felt slightly embarra.s.sed. \u201cYour name is the same as the renter for our apartment\u2019s. The one who just died because of a heart attack.\u201dFan Li: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dJin Yue observed his speechless expression and said, \u201cYou\u2019re not angry, right?\u201d\u201cNo no, of course not.\u201d Fan Li scratched his head. He only had an indescribable feeling; everything he was experiencing now seemed extremely familiar, almost as if he had read about a similar plot somewhere. But everything was muddled, making it impossible for him to understand clearly.Thankfully, he was a very nonchalant person. He couldn\u2019t straighten out his thoughts, so simply gave up. He generously told Jin Yue, \u201cNow we\u2019ve gotten even with each other. From this moment on, neither of us should mention anything about names.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d Jin Yue smiled. She stated as well, \u201cActually, I think you\u2019re a pretty good person.\u201dFan Li blinked. He didn\u2019t know if this was an illusion, but he kept feeling like he and this Jin Yue had quite a lot of fate.Luofeng headquarters. Yu Zhengdu was also asking Shang Que about Fan Li\u2019s situation. \u201cBoss, as a ghost, Fan Li saw three years of his life in advance. Is that going to affect him?\u201dAfter Fan Li returned to life, the ability to check his app\u2019s information had automatically shut down too. Even Yu Zhengdu couldn\u2019t look into it. Because of this, he had no way of knowing if the other\u2019s future had changed or not.\u201cNot sure,\u201d Shang Que shook his head. \u201cTheoretically, probably not. Since he became a death replacement, the moment he saw what he shouldn\u2019t have, his fate had already changed. So, I\u2019m more inclined to believe that the things he saw were all things that occurred because of this incident.\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu had on a serious expression. \u201cDoes that mean that only because of this incident, he\u2019s going to marry a woman named Jin Yue?\u201dShang Que side-eyed him. \u201cWhy are you so invested in his wife?\u201dYu Zhengdu painfully said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be either. It\u2019s because Fan Li kept asking this question. I can\u2019t forget even though I want to.\u201dShang Que thought about Fan Li\u2019s personality. He couldn\u2019t help but admit that Yu Zhengdu was right.Yu Zhengdu fell into deep thought. \u201cSay, if I could open the app, would I also be able to see who my significant other would be in the future?\u201dShang Que sounded slightly tense, \u201cYou\u2019re very eager to know?\u201d\u201cOf course! Which programmer doesn\u2019t want to have love?\u201d Yu Zhengdu suddenly grabbed onto Shang Que\u2019s hand and sincerely asked, \u201cBoss, don\u2019t you want to?\u201dShang Que looked at his hand that was trapped between Yu Zhengdu\u2019s hands. \u201c\u2026\u2026 .\u201d<b>The author has something to say:</b>Shang Que: Yes yes yes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69 - Death InterrogationPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 69 - Death InterrogationAfter the youth \u2013 Fan Li- successfully returned to life, the fake Fan Li who had found a death replacement died of a sudden heart attack too. Additionally, his spirit was arrested by Luofeng\u2019s employees and brought to Luofeng\u2019s headquarters for interrogation.The fake Fan Li was a middle-aged man with a cold, creepy gaze. Upon being brought to Luofeng, he was both panicked and reluctant to admit defeat. When he saw Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que appear together, his expression became shocked. \u201cIt\u2019s you guys!!\u201dYu Zhengdu calmly nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s us.\u201dOriginally, the interrogation of serious offenders was the responsibility of specialized employees. But, because the situation with the fake Fan Li was unique, Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que personally came to do the interrogation.This Fan Li belatedly realized why he had gotten exposed. However, it was already too late to be regretful.Yu Zhengdu didn\u2019t want to bother with wasting time on this type of ghost either. He got straight to the point and said, \u201cWe\u2019ve looked into your circ.u.mstances. You don\u2019t actually have any cultivation, so how come you were able to perform the spell for death replacement?\u201dFan Li stuck his neck out and said, \u201cI\u2019ve already died. I simply refuse to tell you. What can you do about that?\u201d\u201cDoes that mean you\u2019re unwilling to cooperate?\u201d Yu Zhengdu crossed both arms in front of his chest. \u201cYour previous actions have severely broken the order of reincarnation between the mortal realm and Underworld. You\u2019ve committed a crime unforgivable by the Heavens. Do you know what consequences you\u2019ll receive?\u201dThat person remained in the same position. He looked like he no longer cared about anything. \u201cAt worst, I\u2019d have to become a beast. Either way, I was going to be a beast anyways. Being a pig, dog, chicken, or duck is all about the same.\u201dUpon hearing this, Yu Zhengdu came to a realization. He finally understood why this person was so bold as to switch fates with someone. It seemed that he already had an understanding of the six paths of reincarnation, and had already calculated his own results. To him, there wasn\u2019t going to be a worse consequence. Why not take a chance? This was the supposed \u2018 barefooted individuals aren\u2019t afraid of those wearing shoes \u2019.Off to the side, Shang Que was impatient listening to their conversation. He clenched his fist. \u201cSo much useless talk. Just beat him up.\u201d\u201cWait a moment. We\u2019re a socialist company, so must depend on reasoning with people,\u201d Yu Zhengdu stopped Shang Que.Shang Que glanced at him, then silently put his fist away. \u201cOkay. You reason with him first.\u201dUpon seeing this, the fake Fan Li scoffed. \u201cNot bad. h.e.l.l is so with the times these days. You\u2019ve started being more humane. Alright, so reason with me. See if I\u2019ll listen or not.\u201dYu Zhengdu looked at him. \u201cYou just said that there isn\u2019t that big of a difference between being a chicken and being a pig, right?\u201dFan Li simply leaned back; he seemed completely unafraid. \u201cEither way, they\u2019ll both get eaten by humans. How big could the difference be?\u201dYu Zhengdu smiled faintly, then turned on his computer and pulled up a powerpoint doc.u.ment. He linked this to the overhead projector, saying, \u201cWell there\u2019s definitely still a difference.\u201d\u201cOur company is in possession of a complete reincarnation after-service system. It can track the activity of every spirit after they\u2019ve reincarnated. In other words, regardless of if you\u2019re a pig, dog, chicken, or duck, we\u2019ll still be able to find you and chase you down.\u201d Yu Zhengdu switched to the next slide on his powerpoint. There were a few pictures on this slide.Fan Li looked over. The pictures were all of foods using pork as the main ingredient: braised pork, hot pot, roast suckling pig, etc.Yu Zhengdu: \u201cIf you\u2019re willing to cooperate with us, we can provide a more dignified and straightforward way of death for you. For example, being made into roast pig, sweet and sour pork, barbecue pork, etc. However, if you refuse to cooperate\u2026\u2026\u201dHe switched to another slide. This time, there were a few censored images.Yu Zhengdu maintained an elegant smile. \u201cMy apologies. Due to the fact that the images may be a bit gory, I was afraid they might cause you to feel unwell, so have censored them. Either way, if you don\u2019t cooperate, after you reincarnate, we\u2019ll make sure that you won\u2019t be able to live or die\u2026\u2026\u201dFan Li: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dFan Li: !!!!He had originally thought that at worst, he would be reincarnated into a beast, then killed and eaten by humans. He had never expected that the current h.e.l.l could have such power and still be in control of his life after reincarnation.He had truly miscalculated!Yu Zhengdu stared at him. \u201c\u2026\u2026By then, you\u2019ll only be a beast. No matter what we do, it won\u2019t be illegal. Besides, after you die again, you\u2019ll fall into our hands once more.\u201dFan Li: !!!!f.u.c.k, when he had committed crimes as a human, the worst that would happen was dying. He had thought that everything would end with death. But after death, this torture could actually be continuous. And, exactly as the other said, if he reincarnated into the beast path, there wouldn\u2019t be any human laws to protect him. As long as they wanted to, it was entirely possible for them to torture him over and over, endlessly.Fan Li suddenly s.h.i.+vered.Yu Zhengdu saw fear appearing in Fan Li\u2019s eyes and slowly switched to the next slide. \u201cNext, I will introduce you to the fifty different ways to cook chicken. Currently, the most popular and common method is this\u2014\u2014fried chicken. To make delicious fried chicken, there is a very strict recipe to be followed. For example, the temperature of the oil\u2026\u2026\u201dBefore waiting for him to finish, Fan Li weakly raised a hand. \u201cI\u2019ll confess. I\u2019ll confess to everything.\u201dYu Zhengdu stopped his slide-switching. Slightly disappointed, he said, \u201cSo soon? Don\u2019t you want to see how to make rose oil braised chicken and poached chicken?\u201dFan Li seemed to have already predicted his own future. He vehemently protested, \u201c\u2026\u2026No.\u201dOff to the side, Shang Que suddenly raised his hand. \u201cI do.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019ll send the powerpoint to you after the interrogation.\u201dThis fake Fan Li\u2019s original name was Dong Tie. According to his testimony, in the past few years, he had done quite a few bad deeds. Many times, he had almost gotten caught. Eventually, when he was searching online for ways to avoid arrest by law enforcement, he accidentally stumbled across a post by someone whose ID was \u201cJiang\u201d. This person claimed that they could help all fugitives avoid capture.In the beginning, Dong Tie had messaged \u201cJiang\u201d a few times just to try. Unexpectedly, after Jiang sent him a few things, those police officers who had originally been hot on his trail no longer tried to chase him down.With these things as talismans, Dong Tie became even bolder. He started committing more and more evil deeds, becoming more and more out of control. And, curiously, no matter what he did, the police seemed unable to link these crimes to him. In fact, several times, the detectives had even already followed the clues to his rental apartment, but had simply not been able to find him.However, just as Dong Tie started getting c.o.c.ky because of this, he slowly realized that his health was rapidly deteriorating. Serious illnesses continuously struck him.Only now did \u201cJiang\u201d tell him the truth. It turned out that the talismans Jiang had sent him weren\u2019t from the mortal realm; these things could help him cover up the aura of a living person, making it impossible for mortal police officers to discover his whereabouts. But, these dangerous objects from the Underworld were constantly in his presence, so were also constantly encroaching on his energy, making his body weak.More importantly, with the aid of these objects, Dong Tie\u2019s evil desires had grown infinitely. Even if he hadn\u2019t been tainted by the Underworld objects, the Heavens wouldn\u2019t be able to accept him anymore either. Jiang had even introduced him to what punishments he would receive after death because of everything he had done in life.At this time, Dong Tie finally learned that Jiang hadn\u2019t had good intentions from the start. However, he didn\u2019t have any other options. He could only continue to ask Jiang for help.Jiang had been the one who had brought up the methodology for finding a death replacement, and had also provided him with what was needed: a guiding talisman, aperture-closing needle, and the related spells.The things Jiang had given him were all incredibly potent. Everything was also smoothly following Jiang\u2019s plan. Who would\u2019ve thought that they would fail on the verge of success because they had coincidentally done all this during the Life Management app\u2019s internal testing. Dong Tie\u2019s death replacement plan had consequently been exposed.Here, Dong Tie lamented greatly, \u201cWhen I was still alive, I was most afraid of the police force\u2019s real name registration checks. I hadn\u2019t expected that in h.e.l.l, I would get caught because of the same real name registration check\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOtherwise, why would people say \u2018justice will always be served\u2019?\u201d Yu Zhengdu was still angry from the crimes he had just heard Dong Tie confess to. His tone was ice cold. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t done those bad things, why would you be scared of real name registration checks?\u201dAt this time, Shang Que slowly asked, \u201cSo who is this \u2018Jiang\u2019 person?\u201dThe Heavens and earth had collapsed. The spiritual energy of the mortal realm had dissipated. Even cultivators with spiritual roots would experience great difficulty reaching the level where they would be able to find a death replacement. But according to Dong Tie\u2019s testimony, the \u201cJiang\u201d online could easily help others find death replacements. He had also almost succeeded in doing this without alerting h.e.l.l. Such a cultivation level was definitely beyond what a normal person could accomplish.But Dong Tie was very bewildered. \u201cI don\u2019t know either. We only communicate online. I\u2019ve never seen him in person.\u201dYu Zhengdu pushed the laptop in front of him. \u201cContact him now.\u201dOn the computer screen, the recipes for rose oil braised chicken and poached chicken were still clearly displayed. Dong Tie instinctively trembled. He didn\u2019t dare to say anything else, only hurriedly grabbing the mouse and familiarly entering a website address into the address bar. After logging in, he selected a contact with a completely black profile picture.Dong Tie:\u3010Jiang, are you there?\u3011The person with the ID \u201cJiang\u201d was either coincidentally online or had been waiting all this time. He replied very quickly.Jiang:\u3010Have you succeeded?\u3011Dong Tie looked at Yu Zhengdu. Yu Zhengdu took the computer from him and simply started conversing with Jiang while using Dong Tie\u2019s account.Dong Tie:\u3010Yes\u3011Jiang:\u3010Very good.\u3011Jiang:\u3010Now it\u2019s your turn\u3011Yu Zhengdu slightly furrowed his brows.Dong Tie:\u3010What does that mean?\u3011But Jiang didn\u2019t respond again.Yu Zhengdu glanced at Dong Tie, only to see a bewildered expression on the other\u2019s face. It was obvious that he didn\u2019t understand what Jiang meant either. Yu Zhengdu could only turn to look at Shang Que. \u201cBoss, do you know what he means?\u201dShang Que only furrowed his eyebrows. For a moment, he didn\u2019t respond.At this time, Dong Tie suddenly said, \u201cSomeone is calling me. I hear it. Someone\u2019s shouting my name.\u201dShang Que expressionlessly stated, \u201cGhost calling a spirit.\u201dYu Zhengdu instantly thought of how Shang Que had called the fake Fan Li\u2019s name at the hospital and came to an immediate realization. With one eyebrow c.o.c.ked, he asked, \u201cHe\u2019s already dead. Will calling his spirit still do anything?\u201dShang Que shook his head, \u201cNo.\u201dAs expected, a few minutes later, Jiang\u2019s messages appeared on the computer again. He seemed a little agitated.Jiang:\u3010You lied to me!\u3011Jiang:\u3010You\u2019re already dead!\u3011Yu Zhengdu was extremely calm.Dong Tie:\u3010Yes\u3011Dong Tie:\u3010Didn\u2019t you lie to me too?\u3011Dong Tie:\u3010You taught me how to find a death replacement, but actually tried to call my spirit. What is your ultimate goal?\u3011Jiang:\u3010You even know what \u201cghost calling a spirit\u201d is? You\u2019re not Dong Tie? Who are you?\u3011Dong Tie:\u3010You tell me first. Who are you?\u3011But the other\u2019s cautiousness level had surpa.s.sed Yu Zhengdu and them\u2019s predictions. After discovering that Dong Tie had already died and that the account wasn\u2019t being used by the actual Dong Tie, the other only asked three questions. When none of these questions got answered, he immediately disappeared.Yu Zhengdu continued sending messages, extremely unwilling to accept this result.Dong Tie:\u3010Hey hey hey, are you still there?\u3011Dong Tie:\u3010If you\u2019re capable enough to call my spirit, you should be capable enough to answer me\u3011The real Dong Tie: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu sent a bunch of messages, all to no avail. When he refreshed the page again, he discovered that Jiang had directly deactivated his account.Yu Zhengdu turned to Shang Que. \u201cBoss, what should we do?\u201dShang Que paused temporarily. \u201cThis Jiang has probably been planning to take Dong Tie\u2019s life since the very beginning.\u201dUpon hearing this, Dong Tie became perplexed. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d Yu Zhengdu pondered for a bit. He said, \u201cIn the beginning, Jiang pretended to send stuff to Dong Tie to help him avoid police arrest. Actually, though, he was slowly backing him into a corner so that he would have no other option but to accept finding a death replacement?\u201dShang Que nodded. \u201cDong Tie falsely used Fan Li\u2019s name. If he had successfully caused the real Fan Li to replace his death, his name would be able to escape reincarnation, avoiding the control of the Heavens and h.e.l.l. At this time, if someone took his life, that would truly be done without the G.o.ds or ghosts knowing.\u201dYu Zhengdu was confused. \u201cBut why would he need to go through so much effort to take Dong Tie\u2019s life?\u201dShang Que scoffed. \u201cTo avoid the G.o.ds and ghosts means that even the Heavens and h.e.l.l have no clue about it. Who knows what he was planning on doing?\u201dYu Zhengdu looked at Dong Tie meaningfully. \u201cThen my guess is, the result would probably be something even worse than the beast path.\u201dUpon hearing this, Dong Tie couldn\u2019t stop shaking. \u201cIs- is that so?\u201dYu Zhengdu appeared slightly amused. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then it\u2019d prove the saying \u2018wicked people have other wicked people who will torture them\u2019 to be true. If we had known this earlier, we wouldn\u2019t have arrested you.\u201dDong Tie: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dDong Tie was so scared he started begging for mercy, \u201cI\u2019m willing to be a beast, I\u2019m willing to be a beast.\u201dAn employee came and took Dong Tie away. Yu Zhengdu finally looked at Shang Que with worry. \u201cBoss, who is the person named \u2018Jiang\u2019? What does he want to do?\u201d\u201cNot a person. Only a ghost can use \u2018ghost calling a spirit\u2019.\u201d Shang Que\u2019s expression was very serious as well. \u201cBut I\u2019m unable to detect his presence.\u201dYu Zhengdu was silent for a moment. Then, he said, \u201cSeems like this situation may be a lot more complex and troublesome than we initially antic.i.p.ated.\u201dShang Que looked up at him.Yu Zhengdu a.n.a.lyzed, \u201cAccording to what Dong Tie has told us, he found Jiang after seeing Jiang\u2019s post on the dark web. This means that since the beginning, Jiang has been expanding his net. Dong Tie is only one of the people who have been caught in his trap\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que realized this too. \u201cDong Tie might not be the only one who\u2019s looked for a death replacement. We need to increase inspection amounts.\u201dIt was rare for him to be so committed. Death replacement was both an incredibly deceptive and dangerous spell. In the past, when h.e.l.l had been full of workers, inspecting for large amounts of death replacements had also been an extremely tasking job.Yu Zhengdu nodded and made the gesture with his hand. \u201cNo worries. I\u2019ve already added a program that\u2019ll recognize death replacements in the backend system of the Life and Death Accounts. In addition to the mobile app server\u2019s multi-factor authentication, I trust that it\u2019ll be impossible for a death replacement phenomena to take form.\u201dShang Que was quiet for a moment. \u201c\u2026\u2026 .\u201dHe had almost forgotten. It had been a long time since the era where they needed human power to perform inspections. He could only say, technology changes society.A pause later, Shang Que finally said, \u201cWith you in charge of the system, I can rest at ease. Now, let\u2019s place our emphasis on investigating the ident.i.ty of this Jiang person.\u201dHis tone was a bit serious. \u201cIt might take a lot of time and effort\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Yu Zhengdu waved his hands. He scooted over and whispered, \u201cWhen I was chatting with him just now, I offhandedly created a tracking program. As long as he makes any move in the future, I\u2019ll be able to track him down!\u201dShang Que: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dToday is another day that technology has defeated spellcasting.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70 - Difficulties With PromotionPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 70 - Difficulties With PromotionAfter fixing the bugs for death replacement and similar fate switching methods, the Life Management app\u2019s internal testing was completely finished. It became officially released to Underworld citizens: every spirit who hadn\u2019t reincarnated yet could freely download this app. Overnight, the download amount increased rapidly, causing the server to enter a state of emergency.Due to the fact that the energy for Luofeng\u2019s servers came from Shang Que\u2019s power and faith from wors.h.i.+ppers in the mortal realm, when the server reached its limit, all of Luofeng\u2019s employees trembled in fear. They were scared that once the Ghost King felt that he didn\u2019t have enough energy, he would capture a few st.u.r.dily built ghosts to eat as nutrient replenishment.Kang Jin also nervously fixed his wig several times, terrified that he, the one who had been revealed to be bald, would be the first to get sacrificed.This wasn\u2019t the first time Yu Zhengdu was witnessing how scared of Shang Que the company\u2019s employees were. He only felt that their att.i.tudes were sometimes cute to the point of being comical. He thought about it and decided that he should probably go pay a visit to Boss. Thus, he stood up and walked towards Shang Que\u2019s office.The door to Shang Que\u2019s office was half open. Yu Zhengdu knocked a few times, but no one answered. As such, he gently pushed it open. But as soon as he popped his head in, he saw Shang Que sitting in front of his computer, slightly hunched over. His head was very close to the screen, almost as if he were nearsighted. A pair of headphones also covered his ears.Yu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLooking at this posture and pose, could it be that he was gaming again?Just as he was in the middle of his confusion, he saw Shang Que narrow his eyes and read very seriously, \u201cAbandon, a-b-a-n-d-o-n, abandon\u2014\u2014\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026??\u201dWas Shang Que memorizing English vocab?For a moment, Yu Zhengdu was so shocked he froze in place. Shang Que discovered him in his peripheral vision too. He hurriedly leaned back and straightened up, returning to his normal, elegant appearance. With a fake relaxed tone, he continued, \u201cIt would irresponsible me not advise Pany abandon this project.\u201dAfter reading this, Shang Que finally slowly lifted his head and took off his headphones, almost as if nothing had happened. He said, \u201cCome in and sit.\u201dYu Zhengdu barely managed to regain his wits. He, too, acted like this was normal. Keeping up a casual pretense, he asked, \u201cBoss, learning English?\u201d\u201cRecently, it\u2019s gotten a bit difficult to read the financial news,\u201d Shang Que nodded. He continued with a deep expression, \u201cAs the boss of a contemporary company, in order to carry our company further, it\u2019s necessary to have better English.\u201dYu Zhengdu immediately became respectful. He nodded in agreement. \u201cBoss is right. Globalization is the biggest trend in the world right now. Though we\u2019re an Underworld company, that doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t have to receive immigrant ghosts in the future. It truly is very necessary to start learning other languages.\u201dAs he spoke, he sat down. \u201c\u2026\u2026Oh right. I heard that the foreign game really popular right now hasn\u2019t released a Chinese version yet?\u201dShang Que reflexively replied. His tone even seemed a bit pleased, \u201cThat\u2019s right. It hasn\u2019t been brought in yet, and it would be a bit difficult to create a Chinese version. However, I\u2019ve already learned the most important words\u2026\u2026\u201dHe was already halfway through before suddenly coming to a realization. As soon as he looked up, he \u2013 as expected \u2013 saw that Yu Zhengdu\u2019s entire face was in a \u201c=.=\u201d.Shang Que: \u201c\u2026\u2026I learned it offhandedly while learning finance English.\u201dYu Zhengdu had only been trying to trick him. Upon seeing how nervous the other was, he couldn\u2019t help laughing, \u201cI trust you.\u201dShang Que sighed in relief. After, he finally asked, \u201cWhat are you here for?\u201d\u201cUh\u2014\u2014\u201d Yu Zhengdu observed his current state, then shared everyone\u2019s worries, \u201cI just wanted to ask if you\u2019re hungry or not?\u201dShang Que\u2019s gaze suddenly became c.o.c.ky for an instant. \u201cWhy? You want to eat with me again?\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe was a bit confused, but ultimately decided to place everyone\u2019s worries first. He said, \u201cIf you want to eat together, that\u2019s fine too. However, you probably won\u2019t order in the company, right?\u201dShang Que was bewildered. \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018order in the company\u2019?\u201dYu Zhengdu carefully picked out his words before slowly stating the truth, \u201ck2026;k2026;Just, right now, everyone is very worried about your energy levels.\u201dShang Que was silent for a moment. Abruptly, he chuckled softly. \u201cSeems to me like they\u2019re very worried about themselves being plated and served for lunch.\u201dYu Zhengdu stared at him calmly. Upon seeing how speechless he looked with his gaze lowered, he suddenly started laughing. He said, \u201cDon\u2019t be angry , I know you don\u2019t eat ghosts.\u201dShang Que immediately looked up. He looked slightly surprised. \u201cYou know?\u201dAs soon as he said this, he also realized that he had exposed something. He changed his story, \u201cWhy do you think that?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m able to tell\u2026\u2026\u201d Yu Zhengdu held out his hands.Though there had always been legends of the Ghost King eating ghosts in the Underworld, in actuality, from the time that he had entered Luofeng to now, Shang Que hadn\u2019t eaten a single ghost.Shang Que was in charge of all the spirits of the Underworld. If he really had such a diet, there probably would\u2019ve been a \u201c50 Ways to Eat Spirits\u201d released long ago.Shang Que\u2019s gaze became temporarily conflicted. It was hard to tell what he was thinking.Yu Zhengdu didn\u2019t keep asking either. He fixed his posture and sincerely asked, \u201cSo how do you feel? The app just got released a few days ago. The download rates are at their highest. This is a big challenge to the server. I\u2019m actually very worried about you.\u201dShang Que calmly stared at him. He suddenly patted Yu Zhengdu\u2019s hands and comforted, \u201cI\u2019m fine. You don\u2019t need to worry.\u201dHe paused, then changed his mind. \u201c\u2026\u2026Actually, a little bit of worry is okay too.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe was slightly perplexed in his mind. Right in the middle of his pondering, he saw Shang Que prop his chin up and speak in a confused tone, \u201cBut speaking of, my magic really has been changing these days\u2026\u2026\u201dIn an instant, Yu Zhengdu no longer had the energy to think about anything else. He hurriedly asked, nervous, \u201cWhat changes? Has it gotten weaker?\u201dThe Life and Death Accounts had an enormous need for server capacity. In the initial stages of its development, the question everyone had been most worried about was that Shang Que\u2019s power would decline because of this. As such, from the start, Yu Zhengdu had very carefully calculated the server\u2019s capacity. But nothing could be absolute, after all\u2026\u2026\u201cNo,\u201d Shang Que slowly started. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten stronger.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026Such a good thing exists?\u201d\u201cIt is very strange.\u201d Shang Que was very confused too.Ever since the collapse of the Heavens and Earth, along with the decrease of energy in the mortal realm, faith had greatly dwindled. Technically, everybody\u2019s magic would only slowly diminish. The best circ.u.mstance would be that it would remain constant. However, starting from a short while ago, Shang Que had suddenly noticed that his magic seemed to be gradually increasing again. And, as time went by, this sensation became more and more noticeable.\u201cSpeaking of, this feeling is the same as when the mortal realm still wors.h.i.+pped me thousands of years ago\u2026\u2026\u201d Shang Que fell into deep thought. \u201cCould it be that people are secretly wors.h.i.+pping me again?\u201dA long time after he spoke, Yu Zhengdu still didn\u2019t respond. Thus, he glanced up at the other, only to see a thoughtful expression on his face. Yu Zhengdu handed his phone over. \u201cThere are people wors.h.i.+pping you, but not religiously. More like adoration and respect \u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que looked at Yu Zhengdu\u2019s phone. On the screen, Shang Que\u2019s personal Weibo could be seen. It was open to the comment section of one of his \u201cbusiness\u201d selfies.\u3010CEO\u2019s face is too beautiful. I respect\u3011\u3010Handsomeness is justice! Handsomeness is justice! I will always love CEO!\u3011\u3010This female wors.h.i.+pper is willing to be vegetarian for life as long as CEO operates his account everyday!\u3011Shang Que: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que slowly said, \u201cNo wonder my magic experiences strange fluctuations after each time I post selfies\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201cSeems like, as long as your face doesn\u2019t crack, our server won\u2019t collapse.\u201dHe heaved a long sigh of relief and lamented, \u201cThis is true online popularity. In all regards!\u201dShang Que: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAt the same time that the Life Management app became officially released, Luofeng also trained a special, professional, promotional team. This team would have roadshows promoting the mobile app at each reincarnation point. One goal was to promote the benefits of the app to the majority of Underworld users so that everyone would actively download it. Another was to give live lectures about what the app\u2019s functions were and how to use them. This would help answer any questions anyone had, and also increase the speed at which self-service reincarnation could be completely and seriously facilitated.As the core developers of the app, Zhao Ruola and Yu Zhengdu both attended several different business trips with their respective teams. Through this, they could gain a better understanding of how the spirits of different locations were using the app and consequently resolve any and all sudden mishaps.As the company\u2019s CEO, Shang Que also displayed a never-before-seen amount of responsibility. He took the initiative to join Yu Zhengdu\u2019s team and personally partook in the roadshows of many different cities to understand their situations. His hands-on att.i.tude made ghosts feel admiration for him.Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que shuttled between the reincarnation points for several major cities. The acceptance process for the app in most cities was fine; in particular, the reincarnation countdown notifications and reincarnation point mapping service received great reviews. Everyone instantly expressed that with help from these two functions, they could manage their time prior to reincarnation more substantially and reasonably.There were also some reincarnation points who started organizing the immensely popular \u201cGood Ghost Good Deeds Month\u201d under the influence of the concept behind the Good and Evil Scores. This activity was designed to impel all spirits to frequently do good deeds during their time as ghosts. If they got into the habit of doing good things, it might become instinct even after reincarnation. In the next life, they would be able to become good people, creating a positive feedback loop.Ultimately, this activity did, in fact, end successfully. Apparently, there was a spirit who was renowned to be stubbornly lazy in a certain city. After being a beast for two lifetimes and getting killed tragically in both lifetimes, he finally decided, with great pain, to attend the \u201cGood Ghost Good Deeds\u201d mandatory training. Later, he once again reincarnated into a little piglet. Barely a month after birth, when his owner herded him out for free-ranging, he coincidentally encountered an evil person attempting to kidnap his owner\u2019s child. The instinct in the little piglet\u2019s spirit became triggered. Disregarding the fact that he was only a little piglet, he bravely charged forward and b.u.t.ted the evil person away, also garnering his owner\u2019s attention to come save the child.Because of this incident, the little piglet instantly transformed from a meat pig into a pet pig. Ever since, he started living a blissful life in his owners\u2019 home, escaping from the fate of once again being ruthlessly slaughtered.Similar stories spread through the Underworld, causing more and more ghosts to join the spirit reformation plan. They worked hard to accomplish getting a.s.signed to better reincarnation paths. This created a noticeable improvement in the lawfulness of society in both the Underworld and mortal realm.In such a positive atmosphere, Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que reached the last stop of this round of roadshows\u2014\u2014Minan Reincarnation Point.Minan was one of the more old-fas.h.i.+oned cities in the country. There were relatively few local resources for development, so as a whole, the economy wasn\u2019t that great. In the past few decades, the outflow of young people had been severe. The majority of those that remained were left-behind children and elders. This population had a relatively low acceptance rate for new things, especially new technology. The spirits in this region were the same. Currently, this region was the one where promotion was getting along slowest for the Life Management App.\u201cRight now, the app\u2019s download rate for all of Minan and the surrounding areas is less than 60%. One reason is because most of the spirits here are still using keypad phones and weren\u2019t able to switch to smartphones in time. Another is that many people believe the original text message notifications for reincarnation were fine. To have to download an app and check the information themselves, they think it\u2019s too troublesome.\u201d The person in charge of the Minan reincarnation point, Bai Zhinan, explained to Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que about the problems they had encountered during app promotion in Minan.Yu Zhengdu nodded, completely unsurprised. \u201cThis is very normal. Many administrative bodies of varying locations encounter difficulties with rejection when they release new services or systems. If the target population is comparably older in age and more stubborn, this rejection will be more serious.\u201dAside from the local societal problems in Minan, the folk culture had also always been a bit resistant. Even most technology companies of the mortal realm encountered several problems when they tried to promote new products in Minan.Shang Que asked, \u201cHave you attempted any corresponding plans to resolve this?\u201dBai Zhinan: \u201cMy coworkers at the reincarnation point are in the middle of coming up with solutions. Currently, we\u2019re considering holding an event where we give away sacrificial offerings for each app download. The rules limit partic.i.p.ants to spirits who were already past sixty at their time of death. After downloading the app, they can come to the reincarnation point and receive a sacrificial offering. This is borrowing from the methodology that some mortal companies use. Don\u2019t many companies give gifts or discounts for users who verify their accounts when they\u2019re promoting an app? I noticed that the results are pretty good. Only, we would need funds to give away sacrificial offerings. I was just about to submit a request to headquarters\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThat won\u2019t do.\u201d Yu Zhengdu waved his hand. \u201cGiving gifts could stimulate a certain amount of downloads, but their activity on the app later probably wouldn\u2019t be very high. Besides, our targeted audience isn\u2019t the same as those from mortal companies. Right now, the majority of our users are all people who are older in age. If we\u2019re unable to develop app usage into a habit for them and only get them to download it, that wouldn\u2019t be very meaningful.\u201dShang Que made a noise of acknowledgement too. \u201cAnd, if we start giving download users sacrificial offerings in Minan, the users in other cities will definitely be displeased. By then, we wouldn\u2019t have solved the problem. Instead, there would likely be an even bigger conflict.\u201dYu Zhengdu nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s the idea.\u201dBai Zhinan had originally thought that he had come up with a good plan. Upon hearing this, he immediately deflated. \u201cThen what can we do?\u201dYu Zhengdu smiled and placated him, \u201cDon\u2019t worry too much. We can think of something together.\u201dIn the middle of their meeting, a worker from the reincarnation point abruptly rushed in. He said, \u201cBoss, Bai ge, something\u2019s happened.\u201dYu Zhengdu and Shang Que turned around to look at him. Bai Zhinan stood up. With furrowed brows, he asked, \u201cWhat?\u201dThat ghost said, \u201cThe local news just came out with a report saying that a third grader at Minan Elementary tripped a while back and could suddenly remember her past lifetime after that.\u201dBai Zhinan was shocked. He hurriedly asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s the report? Let me see.\u201dThe worker handed a copy of the newspaper over. Additionally, he provided the link to the online report.Yu Zhengdu glanced at Shang Que. The two of them picked up their phones and typed in a search for related news.Minan Daily: Strange News: Third Grader From Minan Elementary Remembers Past Life After Tripping!Yu Zhengdu looked over the report carefully. It said that a student at Minan Elementary tripped a few days ago, resulting in a concussion. After treatment, she seemed to be able to remember part of her past life. She claimed to be an old person, w.a.n.g Chunping, who had died over a decade ago in a village in their neighboring city. She was also able to accurately describe certain things from that village during that time, and also said that she had a son who worked out of town.After the reporter from Minan Daily telegrammed the villagers from that village, she found that the contents described by the child matched what the villagers remembered almost exactly. Additionally, there truly was an old woman named w.a.n.g Chunping who had died over a decade ago in that village. w.a.n.g Chunping also had a son who had always worked out of town.According to this student\u2019s parents, their child had never been to the village in the neighboring city. They also didn\u2019t know a w.a.n.g Chunping. Theoretically, there was no possibility that the child could\u2019ve learned about her from any other source. Even if she had merely heard about w.a.n.g Chunping, it would also be impossible for her to have such a detailed account.Later on, the reporter contacted w.a.n.g Chunping\u2019s son. After the other heard about this, he also found it quite mystifying. It must be known that his mother had already been dead for over a decade. Even he couldn\u2019t clearly remember some of these things.As such, how the child could\u2019ve learned about these things became a mystery. Unfortunately, the child herself also didn\u2019t remember everything. She could only recount a few segments. This wasn\u2019t convincing enough to determine that these were actually w.a.n.g Chunping\u2019s memories.Even so, simply the first part of the news report was enough to create an urban legend in Minan. Consequently, as soon as the newspaper got published, everyone started discussing this story. The student\u2019s parents were also very annoyed. Apparently, that student was currently throwing tantrums every day, saying she wanted to see her son. But she couldn\u2019t remember everything clearly. Thus, she could only stay home from school during this time.After reading the report, Shang Que instantly contacted Kang Jin through Wechat and asked him to check on the records of this student\u2019s past life using the backend server of the Life and Death Accounts.Kang Jin very quickly replied, confirming that the elementary school student was truly w.a.n.g Chunping\u2019s reincarnation.Yu Zhengdu appeared fascinated. He said, \u201cI used to see these types of stories online all the time, but I always thought that they were written by liars or crazy people.\u201dShang Que: \u201cSome are lies and some are by crazy people, but the ones that are able to detail the life of someone completely unrelated to them with such accuracy, those are normally real.\u201dActually, since historic times, it was quite common for spirits to reincarnate still with the memories of their past lives, or for people to suddenly remember their past lives after reincarnation. Many related records could be found after casually flipping through the cla.s.sics.Yu Zhengdu asked, \u201cSo what happens after such an incident occurs?\u201dAllowing a human to carry the memories of their past life could seriously disrupt the order of society. Not only was it a challenge to the basic concepts of human society, taking a step back, it could also reveal the secret of the Underworld and reincarnation. This was a ticking bomb for both the Underworld and mortal realm.\u201cRegarding this, h.e.l.l has never had a really good solution,\u201d Shang Que said in exasperation. \u201cAfter spirits reincarnate, they become part of the mortal realm, meaning they are no longer under the jurisdiction of h.e.l.l. The Underworld is no longer able to force them to do anything.\u201dBut it was also impossible to just completely ignore such incidents. In the past, h.e.l.l would usually negotiate with the other, requiring them to keep the secret. They weren\u2019t allowed to tell anyone about the restricted events of their past life, and also weren\u2019t allowed to contact anyone they had known in their past life. They would be forced to live on with their new ident.i.ty, all the way until the end of their lifetime.Yu Zhengdu: \u201cWhat if they\u2019re unable to?\u201dShang Que glanced at him and calmly said, \u201cChicken warning.\u201d<b>The author has something to say:</b>Xiaokui: Using my face to generate power.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71 - ReincarnationPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 71 - ReincarnationTo anyone, having to live with the memories of a past lifetime but not being allowed to contact anyone from that lifetime \u2013 not being able to see your past relatives and friends, not being able to speak of the stories of the past \u2013 while having to live on with a completely new ident.i.ty for the entirety of this life, was extremely cruel.The situation of \u201cbeing unable to\u201d that Yu Zhengdu had brought up had never been rare. Especially for those who were parents. After remembering the memories from their past life, it was very hard for them to completely let go of their children from their previous lifetimes. There were many who would secretly return to visit or even try to hold conversations. If they noticed that their children weren\u2019t living well, several also used their finances from this lifetime to try and aid their children.No matter how renowned h.e.l.l was, they couldn\u2019t completely eradicate such a phenomenon. Otherwise, there wouldn\u2019t be so many related stories in the folklore.There was something else Shang Que hadn\u2019t told Yu Zhengdu. Actually, in previous dynasties, if they encountered people who weren\u2019t cooperating, h.e.l.l\u2019s solutions were very rough and gruesome. To the Underworld, regardless of if they were living or dead, a person was only a soul. It was only in recent times that everyone started placing more of an emphasis on human rights. Thus, h.e.l.l\u2019s plan of action started slowly becoming gentler.This really made people compliment: Socialism is the best!According to procedure, the appearance of living people with memories of their past life was to be taken care of by each local reincarnation point. Bai Zhinan also came up with a plan based on previous examples and rules. He was in the middle of heading to discuss with w.a.n.g Chunping\u2019s reincarnation.However, before he could even do anything, another employee hurriedly rushed into his office, bringing with him a new nightmare.Employee: \u201cBai ge, something\u2019s happened again.\u201dBai Zhinan\u2019s forehead was covered in sweat. Upon hearing this, his temples started throbbing. \u201cWhat now?\u201dThe employee handed him a phone. It was opened to a livestream page. He said, \u201cThat Master Song who practices hypnosis invited the reincarnated w.a.n.g Chunping and her family to partic.i.p.ate in a livestream.\u201dBai Zhinan almost jumped in fright. \u201cWhy would Master Song do that?\u201dEmployee: \u201cYou know how recently, Dr. Guo from the province hospital\u2019s psychiatry department has been constantly saying that Master Song is a scammer on Weibo and in interviews? I guess that Master Song can\u2019t take it anymore. This time, he not only invited w.a.n.g Chunping\u2019s family, but also Dr. Guo. He said he wants to prove to Dr. Guo and the audience that he isn\u2019t a scammer.\u201dBai Zhinan: \u201cWhat about w.a.n.g Chunping\u2019s parents from this lifetime? They didn\u2019t try to stop anything?\u201dEmployee: \u201cw.a.n.g Chunping\u2019s parents now can\u2019t control her anymore. I heard that she keeps throwing tantrums at home, determined to see her son. That Master Song told them that he could solve w.a.n.g Chunping\u2019s problem. Her parents had no other option, so agreed.\u201dBai Zhinan slammed on his table. \u201cIt\u2019s over now.\u201dMaster Song was originally a hooligan from Minan. He learned how to scam from some unknown source during a trip out of town for work. When he got back, he claimed to have learned hypnosis from the Hong Kong Island area. Then, he opened a hypnosis studio; however, not many people cared about it at first. His business wasn\u2019t great either. Later on, he became inspired by someone and suddenly changed his strategy. He insisted that he could use hypnosis to learn about someone\u2019s past lifetime and thus help people erase karmic debt.As it turned out, this was a correct decision. Minan had a lot of left behind elders and children. Many of these people weren\u2019t very educated. As such, most were more interested in their past lives than in pure hypnosis. Master Song\u2019s business slowly became better. He even became slightly famous.However, following Master Song\u2019s increased fame, the controversies surrounding him increased too. Several locals cussed him out on the local forum. Yet, Master Song didn\u2019t care at all. Either way, he was mainly looking to earn money from those who believed him.But, recently, Dr. Guo from the province hospital\u2019s psychiatry department had publicly criticized him many times in public. This prevented him from continuing to be so calm.Dr. Guo was somewhat popular in the Minan area. Aside from being exceptionally skilled professionally, he had also received national recognition before. Quite a few times, he had appeared on the local news channel for interviews. His announcements were very influential among residents. After enough time, he caused quite a big impact on Master Song\u2019s business.Master Song was a tough bone to pick too. Thus, he bottled up his anger and waited for an opportune time to retaliate.This time, he coincidentally encountered w.a.n.g Chunping\u2019s situation. Because of the media\u2019s reports, locals were pretty invested in w.a.n.g Chunping\u2019s case. Master Song naturally couldn\u2019t miss out on such a perfect opportunity.This livestream had obviously been carefully schemed ahead of time. Not only did Master Song invite the current w.a.n.g Chunping and her family, he also invited his sworn enemy, Dr. Guo, over too.To outsiders, the livestream was promoted along the lines of \u201cApproaching Science: Revealing the Secret Behind w.a.n.g Chunping\u2019s Memories of a Previous Lifetime\u201d.But in actuality, everybody knew very clearly that this was the ultimate battle between Master Song and Dr. Guo. It was also the head-to-head battle between superst.i.tious hypnosis and modern medicine.In order to seem more professional, this livestream was set to proceed in the same manner as an interview. Master Song had even specially invited a local announcer to be the MC.When Bai Zhinan started watching the livestream, the MC had just finished giving a rundown of the entire situation. It was time for both experts to relay their opinions.Master Song said with a profound and unfathomable expression, \u201cThere\u2019s no other answer. This Ding child is a \u2018reincarnation\u2019. In other words, someone who still remembers the memories from their previous lifetime even after their spirit has reincarnated!\u201dMC: \u201cSince Master Song has said this, does that mean that you believe reincarnation exists?\u201dMaster Song: \u201cOf course. As many people know, my hypnosis can awaken a person\u2019s previous memories. I\u2019ve witnessed many situations like Xiao Ding\u2019s. It\u2019s not strange at all.\u201dThe MC had received his instructions. After Master Song finished speaking, he cued Dr. Guo. \u201cDr. Guo, do you agree with what Master Song has to say?\u201dDr. Guo was a true expert. He had originally been disdainful of arguing with someone like Master Song, but Master Song was an excellent scammer. His business became bigger and bigger, causing many of Dr. Guo\u2019s patients to fall for his ploys and leave. Only scamming for money wasn\u2019t a big deal. However, he was worried that if this continued, it would delay treatment for those who were really mentally ill. This was why he had publicly criticized Master Song multiple times.This livestream was the same. Master Song was invested in the influence of w.a.n.g Chunping\u2019s story; Dr. Guo was too. When he had first received Master Song\u2019s livestream invitation, he hadn\u2019t been willing to attend. But after thinking about it, he realized that if he didn\u2019t appear, Master Song would be able to do as he wished more freely. That wouldn\u2019t do. By then, it would be quite difficult to change people\u2019s minds.As such, Dr. Guo could only accept. However, he maintained a noncommittal att.i.tude throughout the entire livestream. Upon hearing Master Song\u2019s opinion, he almost rolled his eyes up to the skies. He dryly said, \u201cRegarding Master Song\u2019s thoughts, I previously expressed my att.i.tude multiple times. I don\u2019t agree with them, nor do I accept them. He\u2019s lying.\u201dBecause of the popularity the topic of \u2018memories of a previous lifetime\u2019 had, in addition to Master Song\u2019s careful planning, this livestream was pretty popular. The livestream platform had placed it on the suggested page, so many netizens from out-of-town were watching too.As soon as Dr. Guo said this, the comments instantly started laughing:\u3010Dr. Guo is so uncompromising, 666 \u3011\u3010Wow, going straight-on. I like\u3011\u3010Fight more loudly.jpg. Master Song charge forward!\u3011Master Song had been part of the society before. After, he had also been dedicated to scamming and promotions. He had lots of cunning ploys on his mind. To be confident enough to invite Dr. Guo, he had naturally made complete preparations ahead of time. Upon hearing this, he didn\u2019t even become angry. With a smile, he said, \u201cThen may I ask how Dr. Guo plans on explaining this child\u2019s situation?\u201dAs he spoke, he gestured for his a.s.sistant to turn the livestreaming camera onto the couch. Everyone saw w.a.n.g Chunping\u2019s reincarnation k2013; the little girl with the surname Ding k2013; sitting with her parents.When the netizens saw that child, they instantly felt that there was something different about her from other children. Her eyes were very big, but her gaze was extremely desolate. Her gaze even seemed heavier than those of her parents.\u3010The little kid\u2019s gaze\u2026\u2026Is a little bit scary\u3011\u3010Can I say that her gaze reminds me of my grandma?\u3011\u3010These really are an old lady\u2019s eyes. Could it be?\u3011Xiao Ding\u2019s parents sat next to her. Each one held onto one of her hands tightly. Both of their expressions were incredibly anxious. One reason they had agreed to attend the livestream was because their daughter\u2019s condition was getting worse and worse. They had asked all doctors possible, but still couldn\u2019t solve this issue. Asking Master Song for help was a last resort. Another reason was that Master Song had said that he would invite Dr. Guo too. Either way, regardless of superst.i.tions or science, someone would give them an explanation.Because of this, as soon as the MC cued Dr. Guo, the Ding parents couldn\u2019t hold themselves back anymore. \u201cDr. Guo, can you explain our daughter\u2019s situation?\u201dDr. Guo pushed his gla.s.ses up and said into the camera, \u201cRegarding the supposed \u2018memories of a past life\u2019 phenomena, scientists performed a related experiment a long time ago. It was called the \u2018fake name test\u2019. Those friends who don\u2019t know anything about it can look it up online to find out what it was about.\u201dThe \u2018fake name test\u2019 had been an experiment designed by past researchers to unravel the mysteries regarding the supposed \u2018memories of a past life\u2019. It was an experiment to test memory.The experiment found a group of people who claimed to have memories of a past life and another group of people who didn\u2019t have memories of a past life. They gave both groups of people forty names and told them to read these names out loud. Two hours later, they gave them 160 other names. These 160 names included the previous forty names. Researchers tasked the partic.i.p.ants to a.n.a.lyze these names.The final results discovered that those individuals who claimed to be able to remember past memories were more likely to believe that the forty names they had seen beforehand were the names of celebrities. Additionally, they were extremely confident in their perceptions. According to a.n.a.lyses, this was because these people were more likely to produce memories that previously didn\u2019t exist. And, they would believe that these made-up memories were their real memories.So, the \u201cpast lives\u201d they mentioned were most likely also created in this manner.Dr. Guo gave a brief explanation of the contents of the experiment, then also gave a few other scientific explanations. As he spoke, he maintained a logical and reasonable att.i.tude. In an instant, he gained the approval of many netizens.But Dr. Guo\u2019s professionalism didn\u2019t scare Master Song. On the contrary, he even seemed to be a bit c.o.c.ky.This wasn\u2019t actually the first time that Dr. Guo was making his views known. Earlier, he had mentioned a lot of these points when he had criticized Master Song. And, the reason Master Song had invited him over this time was to be able to refute his perspective in-person.Master Song was petty. Because of Dr. Guo, he had been very embarra.s.sed previously. He had long since developed an extreme hate for Dr. Guo. Not only was this careful ploy designed to restore his reputation, but it was also a chance to defeat Dr. Guo.To do this, before he had decided to conduct a livestream, Master Song had already visited the Ding family. He first tested the scientific hypotheses Dr. Guo mentioned; he only started the livestream after confirming that nothing could go wrong.Though Master Song didn\u2019t personally believe in past lives either \u2013 he also didn\u2019t know why Xiao Ding could have w.a.n.g Chunping\u2019s memories \u2013 he could confirm that Xiao Ding\u2019s condition was completely different from the hypotheses that Dr. Guo had mentioned.So all he needed to do was disprove Dr. Guo\u2019s theories. Then, he could entirely rely on his promotional techniques to change the concept and confirm that his reasoning was the accurate one.This was also why he was determined to get Dr. Guo to come.Because of this, Master Song had purposefully left more than enough time for Dr. Guo to finish sharing his perspective. After, he finally drawled out, \u201cDr. Guo\u2019s concepts sound very logical. Humans truly do remember things wrong at times. They might also produce certain memories that don\u2019t actually belong to them. However, Xiao Ding\u2019s memories are w.a.n.g Chunping\u2019s memories. I trust that these can\u2019t have appeared out of nowhere, right? So how will Dr. Guo explain this?\u201dDr. Guo scanned him, then said, \u201cThere are many possibilities. For example, Xiao Ding could\u2019ve seen or heard about w.a.n.g Chunping\u2019s life before. That way, after she suffered a brain injury, there was a certain probability that she would develop an irregularity.\u201dBut before Master Song could speak this time, the Ding parents had already said, \u201cBut Dr. Guo, our daughter has never been to w.a.n.g Chunping\u2019s village before. We also don\u2019t know w.a.n.g Chunping at all.\u201dDr. Guo waved his hands. \u201cI\u2019m only mentioning one possibility among many. To get a more specific understanding, further a.n.a.lyses would need to be completed.\u201dThe Ding parents wanted to ask more questions, but Master Song interrupted them. \u201cSince that\u2019s the case, how about we invite a friend out.\u201dDr. Guo furrowed his brows. \u201cWho else did you invite?\u201dMaster Song smiled slightly. He finally revealed his trump card, \u201cNext, let us invite w.a.n.g Chunping\u2019s son out.\u201dUpon hearing this, the Ding parents almost jumped up. \u201cMaster Song, you didn\u2019t tell us about this ahead of time!\u201dMaster Song: \u201cDon\u2019t be agitated. I\u2019m doing this to verify Xiao Ding\u2019s condition. I trust that you two want to know too if what Xiao Ding says about her past life is real or not\u2026\u2026\u201dMaster Song had prepared a speech in advance to smoothly comfort the Ding parents.At the same time, the Minan reincarnation point was close to combusting. Bai Zhinan was beside himself with worry. He hurriedly went to find Shang Que, phone in hand.Shang Que and Yu Zhengdu were in the middle of discussing the following plans for app promotion. They witnessed Bai Zhinan charging over to explain the situation.Bai Zhinan said, \u201cBoss, what should we do? If w.a.n.g Chunping and her son recognize each other later, we likely won\u2019t be able to control the situation anymore!\u201dYu Zhengdu asked, \u201cWhat situation?\u201dBai Zhinan: \u201cThe order of society. If the secret of reincarnation becomes exposed, the effect on both the Underworld and mortal realm would be too great.\u201dThe reconciliation of Xiao Ding and w.a.n.g Chunping\u2019s son wouldn\u2019t only cause problems within normal human familial relations.h.i.+ps. As soon as she revealed too many memories in the livestream and became confirmed to be w.a.n.g Chunping\u2019s reincarnation, she would definitely cause an uproar among society.Bai Zhinan was beside himself with worry. Yu Zhengdu, on the other hand, seemed completely unconcerned. He even slightly wanted to laugh. He said in disdain, \u201cWhat misunderstandings do you have regarding the current netizens?\u201dBai Zhinan: \u201c\u2026\u2026Ah?\u201dShang Que was extremely calm too. \u201cLook at what netizens are saying first.\u201dBai Zhinan reflexively looked at the comments.\u3010f.u.c.k, Master is making an ultimate move!\u3011\u3010What the heck? Master even called someone out. Does that mean this was planned ahead of time? Why am I in so much disbelief?\u3011\u3010Is this scripted?\u3011Bai Zhinan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu drawled out, \u201cSocialist netizens don\u2019t believe in this stuff.\u201dBai Zhinan was in a daze. \u201cIf netizens won\u2019t believe this, why would Master Song direct such a play?\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201cAs long as his target customers believe him, netizens aren\u2019t important.\u201dMaster Song obviously wasn\u2019t hoping for netizens to believe him. His true goal was to publicly challenge Dr. Guo\u2019s authority. As long as Dr. Guo was unable to explain anything later on, those customers that had left because of their trust in him would naturally come back.In the livestream, w.a.n.g Chunping\u2019s son, Fang Quan, walked in.Fang Quan was already sixty something. Because he had often worked out of town in his youth, his entire person seemed extremely worn down and old. When he walked in, he appeared a bit embarra.s.sed. With the natural shyness and introversion of a villager, his gaze landed on Xiao Ding.At the same time, Xiao Ding, who had been silent and in a daze since the beginning of the livestream, abruptly stood up. She shouted, \u201cLittle Dog!\u201dAs soon as she did so, everyone present jumped in shock. Especially Fang Quan, who suddenly widened his eyes. He stuttered out, \u201cH-h-how, how do you know my nickname?\u201dXiao Ding seemed to want to charge forward, but she was trapped by the Ding parents, who each had a tight grasp on her hands. She could only struggle and say, \u201cLittle Dog! I\u2019m Mom! I can finally see you! Come to Mom\u2014\u2014\u201dXiao Ding\u2019s desperate shrieking seemed to be genuine. What originally should\u2019ve been a very touching scene actually appeared a bit comical in Fang Quan\u2019s and the netizens\u2019 eyes.\u3010Sorry, I know I shouldn\u2019t, but seeing an elementary schooler shout \u201cI\u2019m Mom\u201d at an old grandpa really makes me want to laugh\u3011\u3010Right now, I really want to know if I normally also look this comical when I yell \u201cMom loves you\u201d at my idol?\u3011Master Song hadn\u2019t expected for things to become so pa.s.sionate. He couldn\u2019t help feeling extremely pleased in his heart. However, he still needed to maintain order for appearance\u2019s sake. Thus, he placated Xiao Ding and told her to sit down and slowly speak with Fang Quan.Fang Quan hurriedly said, \u201cPlease, please sit and speak.\u201dUpon seeing Fang Quan speak, Xiao Ding finally slightly calmed down. She sat down again, but still kept staring at Fang Quan. Her tears fell incessantly. \u201cLittle Dog, you spent so many years working out of town. Mom waited day and night, hoping that you would come back. All the villagers told me to kill the pig we kept at home, Spot, to sell. But I could never bear to. I was just hoping that when you came back, I could make your favorite Chinese sausages for you\u2026\u2026\u201dXiao Ding clearly had the face of a little girl, but when she spoke, she dragged her words out very long and spoke very slowly. It was similar to the way an old person spoke. And, as she spoke, Fang Quan\u2019s expression slowly became astounded.\u201cHow did you know my nickname is Little Dog? After I left for work in my teens, n.o.body has called me by that name\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWe did used to raise pigs at home. Among them, the one with spots looked the best. We named it Spot\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSince young, my favorite food has been the Chinese sausages my mom made by hand\u2026\u2026\u201dXiao Ding\u2019s stories were confirmed by Fang Quan, one by one. Not only was Fang Quan astonished, but Xiao Ding\u2019s parents and Dr. Guo\u2019s expressions became more and more concerned too.Especially Dr. Guo. He had been a psychiatrist for several decades, so had his own judgements and a.n.a.lyses of all mental illnesses. However, the current condition Xiao Ding was in had clearly exceeded the limits of what he could explain.If he hadn\u2019t already had an understanding of Xiao Ding\u2019s situation, he would suspect that she was actually an actor Master Song had found in advance.But the truth was, he knew that Xiao Ding\u2019s family hadn\u2019t known Master Song at all before this incident. Xiao Ding\u2019s case file also truly existed.Yet, the stories Xiao Ding was currently sharing could no longer be explained by the previous theory that she had come into contact with w.a.n.g Chunping\u2019s information before. What she was saying was too intimate and too detailed, especially regarding things related to Fang Quan\u2019s personal situation. Some of these, even Fang Quan himself couldn\u2019t remember clearly, but Xiao Ding could relay them perfectly.A portion of netizens became slightly suspicious too:\u3010Really? It\u2019s really not pre-planned?\u3011\u3010The old grandpa might have been, but probably not the little kid? How could a little kid be so good at acting?\u3011\u3010I have gooseb.u.mps already. Look at how the little kid talks and acts. She really is an old grandma!\u3011\u3010You\u2019ve all gone crazy?????\u3011\u3010_(:3\u2220)_ I have a theory. Maybe the past life stuff is fake, but the kid\u2019s been hypnotized?\u3011\u3010If so, I really do want to find Master to hypnotize me too\u3011Bai Zhinan clutched his head. \u201cIt\u2019s over, it\u2019s over. w.a.n.g Chunping and her son are going to recognize each other. How are we going to explain this later on?!\u201dIn the livestream, Fang Quan\u2019s face was covered with tears. It seemed that he already believed the little girl before him was his mother\u2019s reincarnation. In a hoa.r.s.e voice, he asked, \u201cMay, may I ask if I can hug you?\u201dBai Zhinan stood up after slapping the table. \u201cSee!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be excited.\u201d Shang Que suddenly side-eyed him. \u201cThere\u2019s still leeway.\u201dBai Zhinan inhaled sharply. He stared straight at Shang Que. \u201cBoss, have you finally decided to act?\u201dShang Que was bewildered. \u201cAct in what way?\u201dBai Zhinan: \u201cYou\u2019re going to kill w.a.n.g Chunping\u2019s reincarnation, right?\u201dShang Que: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dUpon noticing his silence, Bai Zhinan changed his mind. \u201cOr did you want to simply eat her?\u201dShang Que only pretended that he hadn\u2019t heard anything. He calmly said, \u201cAll we need to do is make up a memoir of w.a.n.g Chunping\u2019s life and post it online.\u201dBai Zhinan: \u201c\u2026\u2026Ah?\u201dYu Zhengdu instantly understood. \u201cThe crux for this situation is that Xiao Ding\u2019s family has confirmed multiple times \u2013 they don\u2019t know w.a.n.g Chunping. They also haven\u2019t heard anything about w.a.n.g Chunping before. Thus, n.o.body can explain where Xiao Ding\u2019s memories came from. So, all we need to do is prove that Xiao Ding has read about w.a.n.g Chunping\u2019s story before\u2026\u2026\u201dAnd, the Internet was so advanced these days. The answer to all these problems could theoretically be found online.Everything, including the fact that Xiao Ding\u2019s parents had sworn that Xiao Ding had never come into contact with anything regarding w.a.n.g Chunping, could be completely guided onto the excuse that\u2026\u2026Xiao Ding had read about it online in the past.After, they could then use Dr. Guo\u2019s reasoning to explain things. The mystery could then be entirely explained.Bai Zhinan hadn\u2019t thought that such a move could be possible. He only felt amazed that they had found a solution. Overjoyed, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll go make a memoir right now. However, it might take some time. According to my predictions, the earliest it can be completed is this afternoon.\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s too slow. I\u2019ll do it.\u201d Yu Zhengdu turned on his own computer. \u201cI\u2019ll simply export w.a.n.g Chunping\u2019s life events from the Life and Death Accounts\u2019 backend server\u2026\u2026 Oh, it might be better to export the life events from their whole village and make a \u2018deceased elders\u2019 memoir\u2019. That\u2019s more believable.\u201dBai Zhinan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe barely managed to turn his head back before he silently continued watching the livestream.In the livestream, Master Song stared at Dr. Guo. Extremely satisfied, he asked, \u201cDr. Guo, can you explain Xiao Ding\u2019s current situation?\u201dIn actuality, he had asked about Xiao Ding\u2019s situation long before. He had also purposefully invited Fang Quan on set, all to give Dr. Guo this fatal blow.Dr. Guo rested his gaze on Xiao Ding. His brows were tightly furrowed together, but he couldn\u2019t say a single word.Master Song was on the brink of throwing his head back and laughing. He couldn\u2019t help continuing to provoke, \u201cDr. Guo, not everything can be explained using science. It seems to me that you should stop using your knowledge to scare people. Occasionally, you can come attend my lessons too. Let\u2019s communicate a bit. What do you think?\u201dDr. Guo \u2019d. He wanted to refute the other, but didn\u2019t know where to start. He was a cautious person. Before he could produce reliable evidence, it was impossible for him to start spouting nonsense like Master Song often did.On the other side, the MC felt very conflicted too. However, he still followed the script and, after gaining Xiao Ding\u2019s parents\u2019 approval, said, \u201cIt seems that Old Mr. Fang is very confident that Xiao Ding is his mother who pa.s.sed away a decade ago. So, how about having Old Mr. Fang and Xiao Ding embrace now.\u201dXiao Ding\u2019s parents looked concerned. They really weren\u2019t willing to believe that their daughter was actually the mother of an old man. Yet, this situation had already surpa.s.sed their control. They had no other choice but to let go of Xiao Ding\u2019s hands.Xiao Ding took two steps forward and gestured for Fang Quan to come closer. \u201cLittle Dog, come here. Come into Mom\u2019s arms.\u201dHer p.r.o.nunciation and tone were so familiar. Though she looked like an elementary school student, Fang Quan could no longer hold himself back. His voice cracked as he shouted, \u201cMom\u2014\u2014\u201dMaster Song excitedly pulled out his phone and prepared to personally take a picture of this scene. He would use it in the future as his studio\u2019s promotional picture.Only to see Fang Quan open his arms and step forward, then tightly embrace Xiao Ding. He whimpered and cried, \u201cMom\u2014\u2014\u201dAt this time, the desolate years in Xiao Ding\u2019s eyes suddenly disappeared. They returned to the brightness that young children should have. After, she turned around to look at Fang Quan. She immediately started shrieking in fear, \u201cMom, Mom, where are you? There are bad people here, I\u2019m scared\u2014\u2014\u201dThe Ding parents: \u201c\u2026\u2026??\u201dThe live audience and netizens: \u201c\u2026\u2026??\u201dMaster Song: \u201c\u2026\u2026??\u201dAt the Minan reincarnation point, Bai Zhinan, who had been so nervous about this scene that he had almost come back to life, was even more confused: \u201c\u2026\u2026???\u201dOnly Shang Que instinctively looked at Yu Zhengdu.Yu Zhengdu happened to look up too. He met Shang Que\u2019s gaze and asked, perplexed, \u201cWhat?\u201dShang Que: \u201cWhat did you do just now?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201d Yu Zhengdu was extremely lost. He thought about it, then made a noise of realization. He added, \u201cI just opened the backend system for Xiao Ding and discovered that a copy of her records from her time as w.a.n.g Chunping had been added to her current folder. I offhandedly deleted it.\u201dShang Que: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dShang Que turned the livestream over for him to see. \u201cJust now, Xiao Ding seemed to have forgotten the memories of her previous life again.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dn.o.body had expected that after the Life and Death Accounts system got updated, it could also be used for this.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72 - Debugging ProgramPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 72 - Debugging ProgramIn the livestream, Xiao Ding\u2019s parents and Fang Quan had all become stunned. For a moment, they even forgot to react. Instead, it was Xiao Ding who struggled out of Fang Quan\u2019s embrace, terrified, and turned around to jump into Mother Ding\u2019s arms. She lunged over and buried her head in Mother Ding\u2019s chest. She cried, \u201cMom, I\u2019m scared.\u201dIn that moment, Mother Ding suddenly had a strange feeling that her daughter seemed to have returned. She hurriedly clutched Xiao Ding close and gently patted her back. \u201cDon\u2019t be scared, don\u2019t be scared. Mom\u2019s here.\u201dFather Ding nervously scooted closer too to ask, \u201cBaby, what\u2019s wrong?\u201dHe gently plucked Xiao Ding out of Mother Ding\u2019s arms and wrapped her in his own arms. He pointed at Fang Quan and inquired, \u201cEarlier, when you saw\u2026\u2026him, weren\u2019t you very happy?\u201dXiao Ding had already stopped crying due to Mother Ding\u2019s comforting. Now, her eyes were red. She scanned Fang Quan out of her periphery, then buried her head in Father Ding\u2019s chest again. She quietly said, \u201cI don\u2019t know him.\u201dFang Quan, who had just thought that he had successfully regained his mother, became stunned upon hearing this. He stared at Xiao Ding\u2019s face, perplexed.Upon noticing that the plot had taken a sudden and unexpected turn, travelling further and further away from his predicted resolution, Master Song instantly panicked. He said, \u201cXiao Ding, what\u2019s wrong? Didn\u2019t you say just now that Old Mr. Fang Quan was your son in your past life?\u201dXiao Ding turned around in her father\u2019s embrace and glanced at Master Song. She abruptly blurted out, \u201cI remember you. You gave me his picture to look at before\u2026\u2026\u201d As she spoke, she pointed at Fang Quan.As soon as Xiao Ding said this, the entire set became shocked.Especially Xiao Ding\u2019s parents. Their expressions completely changed. Xiao Ding\u2019s father hurriedly tugged at Xiao Ding and asked, \u201cBaby, what do you mean? Can you tell Dad clearly?\u201dXiao Ding seemed unable to clearly recall everything. She repeatedly tugged at her hair and scanned Master Song out of her peripheral vision. Softly, she said, \u201cWhen he came to our house previously, he gave me that person\u2019s picture to look at\u2026\u2026\u201dMaster Song had long since broken out in cold sweat. Upon hearing this, he finally couldn\u2019t hold himself back anymore. He shouted, \u201cLittle kid, don\u2019t spout random things! I gave you the picture to look at ahead of time to allow you to recognize him in advance. I only allowed you to come on the livestream because you personally confirmed that Elder Fang was your son!\u201dIn order to ensure that nothing would go wrong during the entire livestream, not only did Master Song visit Xiao Ding\u2019s family ahead of time, he also privately spoke with Xiao Ding for a bit behind the Ding parents\u2019 backs. He secretly showed Fang Quan\u2019s picture to Xiao Ding and received a personal confirmation from the little girl that Fang Quan truly was her son in a past life.Because of this, Master Song dared to be bold enough during the livestream to invite Fang Quan onto the set.Except, he hadn\u2019t expected that during the climax, Xiao Ding would suddenly lose her memories from her past life again.And in the time that she had regained her past life\u2019s memories, her current memories had become an entangled mess of present and past: now, the past memories had been lost. The only ones remaining were her current memories, which were somewhat spotty and chaotic.In addition to the fact that she was originally only an elementary schooler around the age of ten, she couldn\u2019t explain things very clearly. When she spoke, listeners perceived an entirely different meaning.And the reb.u.t.tal Master Song gave in a moment of panic seemed to confirm Xiao Ding\u2019s words in a roundabout way.As such, the atmosphere on set became very tense.Dr. Guo, who had felt extremely confused about Xiao Ding\u2019s condition earlier, now regained his wits. His expression revealed his epiphany. He slowly stated, \u201cAs such, things can be explained clearly. Xiao Ding suffered a brain injury, so originally had muddled memories. At this extremely crucial time, Master Song gave her some things she shouldn\u2019t have looked at, which easily disrupted her memory process. This caused her to develop memories that didn\u2019t actually belong to herself \u2013 she also firmly believed in these memories.\u201dXiao Ding\u2019s parents kept a firm grasp on Xiao Ding, who was nestled by their sides. With anger, they glared at Master Song. Father Ding\u2019s tone was completely cold, \u201cMaster Song, previously, you told us that you knew how to cure my daughter. Thus, we trusted you and brought her to film this livestream. Who knew that you would do something like this behind our backs!\u201dThe netizens all started criticizing too:\u3010f.u.c.k, this Master Song really is a scammer!\u3011k3010;He\u2019s too much. He actually dares to treat a child with brain damage in this manner. What to do if the child\u2019s treatment has been delayed by him?!k3011;Master Song was ultimately a professional scammer who had his own studio. At such a time, he still didn\u2019t entirely lose his wits. He gently placated the Ding family, \u201cYou all, please calm down and listen to me. I didn\u2019t have any other intentions when showing Xiao Ding Elder Fang\u2019s photo previously. I only wanted to confirm if she truly was w.a.n.g Chunping. If she didn\u2019t recognize Elder Fang, it would be no use if I showed her his photo. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201dFather Ding only \u2019d once. However, he didn\u2019t completely deny anything.Upon noticing his expression, Master Song immediately knew that he still had a chance. He instantly came up with a plan and faked calmness to smile and say, \u201cBesides, just now, you guys witnessed it too. Xiao Ding could relay so many things regarding Elder Fang. That can\u2019t have happened just from seeing a photo.\u201dFrom off to the side, Dr. Guo scoffed. \u201cWho knows whether or not you also said something to Xiao Ding when you were showing her the picture?\u201d\u201cDr. Guo, you\u2019re too hurtful with your words.\u201d Master Song glared at Dr. Guo in blame. He refuted, \u201cEven Elder Fang himself could no longer clearly remember many of the things that Xiao Ding said. Even if I wanted to say anything to her, how would I know about those things?\u201dAs soon as Master Song finished speaking, everything returned to the starting point. At the end of the day, it was still the fact that the events Xiao Ding had previously shared regarding w.a.n.g Chunping were too detailed and too private. Thus, Dr. Guo couldn\u2019t explain this incident using logical reasoning.Master Song observed everyone\u2019s silent expressions and knew that he had already salvaged the situation. With a friendly expression, he looked at Xiao Ding and smiled. \u201cXiao Ding, tell everyone. All those things that you previously said were memories that you suddenly remembered yourself, right?\u201dXiao Ding buried her head into her father\u2019s embrace. She called out, \u201cI don\u2019t remember anymore.\u201dMaster Song: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMother Ding seemed to realize something at this instant. She quickly scooted closer to her daughter and asked in a low voice, \u201cBaby, tell Mom. What don\u2019t you remember?\u201dXiao Ding\u2019s voice was stuffy. \u201cMom, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201dFather Ding belatedly realized this too. He hurriedly cupped his daughter\u2019s face and asked, \u201cBaby, do you remember who w.a.n.g Chunping is?\u201dAs he spoke, he pointed at Fang Quan again, \u201cAnd him. And all the things about w.a.n.g Chunping\u2019s village. Weren\u2019t you talking about them just now?\u201dXiao Ding furrowed her eyebrows. \u201cDad, what are you saying? I don\u2019t understand.\u201dAt this time, the aged feeling had already disappeared from Xiao Ding\u2019s eyes. They returned to the pure and clear eyes that a child should have. Additionally, they were filled with confusion from the continuous questions.Father and Mother Ding stared at each other. At this moment, Dr. Guo walked over. He said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, let me take a look.\u201dNow, everyone finally realized that Xiao Ding seemed to have forgotten everything about w.a.n.g Chunping, even though she had kept talking about the other earlier. The Xiao Ding of right now was once again the carefree third grader of the Ding family.Mother Ding nervously hugged Xiao Ding, guiding her to cooperate with Dr. Guo\u2019s check up. On the other hand, Father Ding glared at Master Song coldly. \u201cMaster Song, how do you plan on explaining this?\u201dMaster Song hadn\u2019t expected in the slightest that things would progress in this manner. If not for the fact that they were still live, he would\u2019ve charged forward and shook Xiao Ding by the shoulders, screaming at her.Fortunately, he had been a scammer for a long time. He had a lot of experience dealing with these things. Only a moment later, he had already come up with a plan. He instantly gazed profoundly at Xiao Ding and said, \u201cAs expected, I was right. Xiao Ding truly is a reincarnation.\u201dBefore Father Ding could speak, Dr. Guo had already become angry enough to start a physical fight. He refuted, \u201c You with the surname Song , how dare you continue to spout bulls.h.i.+t. Xiao Ding has clearly suffered memory confusion because of her brain injury. The most important thing right now is for her to stay calm and attend regular examinations. This way, she\u2019ll slowly heal by herself. For your own goals, you made her attend a livestream at such a time, and also gave her things to look at that she shouldn\u2019t have. You\u2019ve increased her mental load. If Xiao Ding\u2019s recovery happens to be negatively impacted, can you afford to take responsibility?\u201d\u201cDr. Guo, how come you\u2019re talking about that stuff again??\u201d Master Song was completely calm. His expression didn\u2019t even change as he spoke, \u201cI already said before that Xiao Ding\u2019s memories definitely couldn\u2019t have been affected by humans. How about this. Explain to me where Xiao Ding read about the events regarding w.a.n.g Chunping that she shared earlier. As long as you can explain this, I\u2019ll close my studio today in front of all the netizens currently watching. What do you think?\u201dOnly to see Dr. Guo\u2019s chest puff up with anger. For a long time, he couldn\u2019t say anything.Master Song heaved a secret sigh of relief. The reason he had dared to make such a big bet was naturally because he had been prepared ahead of time. No matter how Xiao Ding behaved, there was one thing he could absolutely confirm: that regardless of in w.a.n.g Chunping\u2019s village or online, there were no records about w.a.n.g Chunpings\u2019 life at all. Based on this point alone, Dr. Guo would never be able to give a scientific explanation for Xiao Ding\u2019s memories.As soon as Master Song finished talking, the netizens went into an uproar.\u3010Bada.s.s, Master Song. You\u2019re gambling with your own business! Don\u2019t chicken out, Dr. Guo. Charge!\u3011\u3010Am I the only one who thinks Master Song is very cunning? Xiao Ding\u2019s situation is completely inexplicable\u3011\u3010Doesn\u2019t that mean we can only say that the guy with the surname Song is actually a little bit capable?\u3011\u3010Dr. Guo seems very stumped too. Tragic\u3011\u3010Actually, I believe Dr. Guo. However, this situation really can\u2019t be explained. Technically, Dr. Guo has been tricked by Master\u3011Upon noticing that Dr. Guo had nothing to say, Master Song became extremely pleased. He took this opportunity to say, \u201cDr. Guo, if you can\u2019t explain, there\u2019s no need to force yourself. I won\u2019t make things difficult for you anyways. I only hope that in the future, you won\u2019t continue to defame me\u2026\u2026\u201dMaster Song had only been halfway finished with his spiel when he heard the MC suddenly raise his voice and shout, \u201cAiya, everyone, hurry and come see. What is this?\u201dEveryone jumped in fright. They turned around to look together, only to see that the MC was in the middle of pointing at the livestream comments. \u201cJust now, a netizen posted a link and said that they found a memoir regarding all the elderly individuals in w.a.n.g Chunping\u2019s village. In it are records of w.a.n.g Chunping\u2019s life\u2026\u2026\u201dMaster Song: \u201c\u2026\u2026???\u201dOriginally, that MC had been reading the comments to be able to appropriately guide the show\u2019s direction. Just now, as Master Song had been challenging Dr. Guo, a netizen had suddenly enlarged the font of their comment and posted a link. They claimed that they had discovered records relating to w.a.n.g Chunping\u2019s life. The events that Xiao Ding had mentioned could be found in the memoir.This netizen\u2019s comment achieved the same effect as a crack of thunder on a cloudless day. Instantly, many people followed their link; they really did end up finding a memoir of w.a.n.g Chunping\u2019s life.More accurately speaking, it was a memoir of all the old villagers in w.a.n.g Chunping\u2019s village. not only did it contain w.a.n.g Chunping\u2019s stories, but also the stories of many other deceased elders around the same age as w.a.n.g Chunping.n.o.body knew who had created that website. It was extremely simple and also hidden, meaning that it wouldn\u2019t come up in a search. Perhaps this was the reason that netizens hadn\u2019t managed to find it yet.As such, the origins for Xiao Ding\u2019s muddled memories seemed to have been discovered.Dr. Guo and the Ding parents clicked into that link as well. A while later, they turned around in sync and stared at Master Song.Master Song: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMaster Song chose to instantly turn off the livestream.But it was already too late. Screen recordings of this livestream and a link to the hidden website with w.a.n.g Chunping\u2019s village\u2019s memoir quickly spread across the Internet, causing an uproar.Prior to turning off the livestream, Master Song had promised that as long as Dr. Guo could find the origins for Xiao Ding\u2019s memories, he would close his studio on the spot. This was like a tall and proud flag . Netizens took screenshots and whipped the corpse . Originally, Master Song had wanted to pretend that he was dead . But not soon after, he got reported by a mult.i.tude of netizens and was forced to close his studio whether he wanted to or not.On the other hand, what Dr. Guo said regarding the science of memory became spread far and wide as well. This allowed more people to gain a scientific understanding about the supposed mystery of reincarnations.After, the Ding parents\u2019 actions proved Dr. Guo right too. They found a professional to check their family computer\u2019s browser history. Ultimately, in a file that had been deleted long ago, they discovered that anonymous website\u2019s link. Everything proved that Xiao Ding had very likely unintentionally discovered this link previously. Those strange memories of hers could now be explained.Currently, after much rest, Xiao Ding\u2019s brain damage had slowly started healing. Those random memories naturally disappeared as well.Though they had already proven that Xiao Ding wasn\u2019t actually a reincarnation, her behavior during the livestream, which was extremely similar to w.a.n.g Chunping\u2019s, still made Fang Quan feel nostalgic. After everything ended, Fang Quan and the Ding parents exchanged contact information. He sincerely expressed his hope to be allowed to occasionally visit Xiao Ding.Though the Ding parents were slightly traumatized by the period of time where Xiao Ding\u2019s memories were muddled, they had still been somewhat touched at the same time. Especially because Mother Ding herself was a mother. Thus, the couple discussed between themselves and decided that after Xiao Ding healed completely, after she would no longer misremember her memories, she would be allowed to reasonably meet with Fang Quan.Following this, Xiao Ding maintained a frequency of one meeting a year with Fang Quan. Though each meeting was brief and the two of them didn\u2019t have much to talk about, Fang Quan still kept this up. But this all happened later, so we won\u2019t talk about it anymore.Meanwhile, in current times, following the anonymous website\u2019s exposure, the villagers in the village w.a.n.g Chunping lived in all logged in to check. In the end, they confirmed that the events listed on the website were entirely the same as several of the events that had occurred in the lifetimes of the elders in the village who had died over a decade ago. But n.o.body could confirm who had created the website and curated the memoir.Several villagers who had left the village for work and had thus been unable to spend time at home with their parents used this website to gain an understanding of their parents\u2019 lives and thoughts. There were too many left behind elders in this area. Many people didn\u2019t get a lot of time to hold family reunions with their children. n.o.body knew their stories because they had n.o.body to tell them too. The situation this time had affected them greatly. It instantly caused a trend for memoirs in Minan and its surrounding areas. It also allowed the left behind phenomenon in this region to receive more attention.After the incident regarding past memories, Minan\u2019s reincarnation point became extremely cheery too. Many ghosts who had previously been unwilling to download the app now recognized that they could use the app to reminisce about the significant events in their lives.These ghosts had nothing else to do while waiting for reincarnation. Everyday, all they did was go square dancing with their Underworld friends, reminisce about their lives, and brag. However, because many were old, there were several things that they couldn\u2019t completely remember. Additionally, some people didn\u2019t believe their bragging. But now, everything would be resolved. As long as everyone downloaded the app, they would be able to scroll down to the Important Life Events section and casually chat for multiple days and nights with other ghosts. If anyone else mocked them about bragging when they were actually telling the truth, they could directly open the app and prove everything with just a click.But to Bai Zhinan, in comparison to solving the problem about the app\u2019s popularity, another issue deserved his attention more.\u201cUnbelievable. Completely unbelievable!\u201d Bai Zhinan gave Yu Zhengdu a thumbs up. In complete admiration, he said, \u201cI hadn\u2019t expected that the Life and Death Accounts system could so easily resolve our ancient problem.\u201dAfter deleting Xiao Ding\u2019s memories from her past life with a press on his keyboard, Yu Zhengdu completed a new scan of the Life and Death Accounts\u2019 operating mechanisms. He discovered that those individuals who kept their memories from their previous lives would regain these memories after satisfying a certain condition. Following this, a part of their memory files would get duplicated into the storage for their current life.Which meant that if another \u201creincarnation\u201d appeared in the mortal realm, the Underworld didn\u2019t need to do what they had done in the past \u2013 try to repair the situation after everything had happened \u2013 anymore. They could simply use the Life and Death Accounts\u2019 backend server to quickly delete these reincarnations\u2019 past memories. As such, not only would they be able to keep the process of reincarnation a secret, they would also be able to provide some relief to those reincarnations .Shang Que made a noise of acknowledgment and nodded. His gaze was slightly amused as he glanced at Yu Zhengdu. \u201cIf anything similar occurs in the future, it\u2019ll be much simpler to deal with it.\u201dBai Zhinan said, \u201cHowever, Yu ge\u2019s going to have to work hard. If we encounter such a situation again, we\u2019d have to trouble you to personally delete that information.\u201dThe Life and Death Accounts\u2019 backend server couldn\u2019t be accessed by everyone. Additionally, it had been encrypted several times. Now, the only people who had permission to login and use the backend server were Shang Que and Yu Zhengdu.\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad,\u201d Yu Zhengdu waved his hands. \u201cI looked into it. These stubborn memories act in practically the same manner as computer bugs. I simply inputted a debugging program into the system. If any such instances with recurring memories appear again, the program will treat them like bugs and automatically kill them.\u201dAs such, as soon as those memories became duplicated, they would immediately be deleted. In other words, it was very likely that the mortal realm would never encounter problems regarding reincarnations ever again. Naturally, there would no longer be a need to try and salvage the situation after it occurred.Bai Zhinan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que, who was already used to Yu Zhengdu\u2019s capabilities, nodded. \u201cEven better. Solving the problem directly at the source.\u201dBai Zhinan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He said, \u201cBoss, I want to submit a request to head back to the company two days later than scheduled.\u201dShang Que furrowed his brows. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201cOne of my cla.s.smates in Minan is getting married. He\u2019s invited me to attend the wedding.\u201dIt turned out that one of the students in their cla.s.s was a Minan native. The location of his wedding reception was his hometown. Because it was quite far from Fu City, he hadn\u2019t invited his university cla.s.smates to attend. Originally, he had been planning on treating his cla.s.smates to a meal back in Fu City to make up for this.But while chatting in the group chat a few days ago, that cla.s.smate unintentionally discovered that Yu Zhengdu happened to coincidentally be on a business trip and was in Minan. Thus, he sent the other an invitation. Yu Zhengdu thought that since he was here anyways, it wouldn\u2019t be right not to attend. Thus, after resolving all the issues on hand, he came to ask Shang Que for some time off.When Shang Que heard this, he didn\u2019t immediately respond. Instead, he scanned Yu Zhengdu with his peripheral vision. For some reason, his tone seemed slightly insinuating, \u201cYour cla.s.smate is getting married really early.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s been with his girlfriend since college. They\u2019ve been in a relations.h.i.+p for several years and had originally been planning to get married after graduation,\u201d Yu Zhengdu\u2019s tone was even more insinuating than Shang Que\u2019s. \u201cReally makes people feel jealous and envious.\u201dShang Que\u2019s tone was probing, \u201cAre you very jealous?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m obviously envious,\u201d Yu Zhengdu sourly said. \u201cHow shameful it is to be a single programmer. Especially since I\u2019m a rather handsome programmer. It\u2019s really very easy to be accidentally harmed.\u201dShang Que was confused, \u201cAccidentally harmed in what way?\u201d\u201cEy, when my cla.s.smate sent me the invitation, he said that he had left two spots for me. He told me to bring a significant other,\u201d Yu Zhengdu\u2019s tone was p.i.s.sed. \u201cThough he was being unintentional, as a sensitive single dog, I felt that I had been mocked. I\u2019m here on a business trip. Who casually brings their significant other along during business trips? I could bring a boss along, though.\u201dShang Que\u2019s gaze drifted away. \u201cSince you want to bring me along, then I\u2019ll go.\u201dYu Zhengdu hadn\u2019t even finished complaining when he heard Shang Que speak. He became bewildered. \u201c\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201dHe had just made to ask Boss why his comprehension abilities were so twisted when he heard Shang Que mutter to himself, \u201cFortunately, my schedule for the next two days isn\u2019t too packed. I should be able to squeeze out some time and accompany you to the wedding reception.\u201dHe looked towards Yu Zhengdu, expression curious. \u201cI vaguely recall that it\u2019s required to bring red envelopes along when attending weddings in the mortal realm. If we go together, do we need to give one red envelope or two?\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dBoss had already scheduled everything clearly. If Yu Zhengdu were to reject him now, he might start researching what recipes the other could be made into in the next life.Yu Zhengdu smiled slightly. \u201cOne\u2019s enough. I\u2019ll give it.\u201dCoincidentally, that cla.s.smate who was getting married started pestering him in the cla.s.s chat:Jia Yihua:\u3010Yu Zhengdu, are you sure you can come to the wedding? Are you coming by yourself or are you bringing a significant other?\u3011Zhang Qingqing:\u3010???? What gossip have I missed out on? Zhengdu has a significant other?\u3011Jia Yihua:\u3010Just asking theoretically.\u3011Cla.s.smate A:\u3010Be clear with your words. You scared me to death.

It turned out that this was of a comment under Shang Que\u2019s Weibo:\u3010CEO, post your boyfriend\u2019s pictures too\u3011Under this was Shang Que\u2019s reply: From Today On I Will Be A European G.o.d: NoZhang Qingqing:\u3010See, CEO has tacitly acknowledged the t.i.tle of \u201cboyfriend\u201d. Tsk tsk tsk\u3011Yu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu turned to look at Shang Que. He was in a strange mood. Coincidentally, Shang Que happened to look over too. He asked, \u201cYou don\u2019t have red envelopes on you, right? Should we go buy some?\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe didn\u2019t know if he had been affected by his cla.s.smates, but right now, he seemed to be getting the feeling that Boss was being too enthusiastic?However, he honestly couldn\u2019t ask the question out loud. After all, Boss had never acted like he was pursuing him? Wouldn\u2019t it be too stupid if he took the initiative to ask about this?Yu Zhengdu thought about it and decided that he needed to observe a bit more first. Thus, he nodded. \u201cThen let\u2019s head out and buy red envelopes now. We can also walk around.\u201dThis was Yu Zhengdu\u2019s first time in Minan. He decided that he could squeeze some time out to look around, so headed to the downtown walking street with Shang Que.While walking, Yu Zhengdu tentatively asked Shang Que, \u201cSpeaking of, Boss, you\u2019ve lived for so long. Have you ever had a relations.h.i.+p?\u201d\u201cYou want to know about this?\u201d Shang Que glanced at Yu Zhengdu out of his periphery. His tone was a bit meaningful.Yu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026We\u2019re making small talk, right?\u201dShang Que quieted for a moment before slowly starting, \u201cIn the past, there were several G.o.ddesses and female ghosts within the three realms who pursued me\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201cSo you\u2026\u2026?\u201dShang Que gave him a gaze that read . \u201cI didn\u2019t accept any of their pursuits.\u201dYu Zhengdu: Failed once again at reading Boss\u2019s gaze!Shang Que paused. As if with great determination, he added, \u201cBut now, I could consider\u2026\u2026\u201dBefore he finished speaking, he saw Yu Zhengdu point across the street. \u201cThere\u2019s a stationary store there. They should sell packs of red envelopes. Stand here and wait for me. I\u2019ll come back after buying one.\u201dYu Zhengdu had already disappeared before Shang Que could react. He agilely squeezed through the crowd and made his way to the other side of the street. In only an instant, his figure was already gone.Shang Que: \u201c\u2026\u2026Oh.\u201dYu Zhengdu bought a pack of red envelopes from the stationary store and walked out. He was about to run back to the other side of the street when he turned around and noticed that there was a pretty popular local milk tea store next to him. He thought about it and walked into the store instead. After taking a picture of the menu, he sent it to Shang Que.Yu Zhengdu:\u3010Boss, what do you want to drink?\u3011Shang Que had originally been daydreaming. After suddenly receiving this message from Yu Zhengdu, his eyes unconsciously became filled with joy.My Broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010This, this, and this.\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010\u2026\u2026You want three cups?\u3011My Broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010 , extra sugar, extra pearls.\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010\u2026\u2026Okay\u3011The milk tea store was pretty crowded. Yu Zhengdu waited a long time before walking out with four cups of milk tea. Because he was holding too much stuff, he needed to switch hands. As soon as he finished doing so, someone tapped his shoulder from behind.\u201cFriend, you\u2019ve dropped something,\u201d a low voice said.Yu Zhengdu turned around, only to see a man wearing sungla.s.ses and a mask hand over a pack of red envelopes.\u201cOh oh, thank you.\u201d While speaking, Yu Zhengdu grabbed the pack of red envelopes. However, as soon as he took two steps forward, he suddenly realized that something was wrong. The pack of red envelopes he had bought had originally all been wrapped in clear plastic. Yet, there was one outside of the pack in the pile the stranger had just handed him.Yu Zhengdu felt slightly suspicious and raised the pack of red envelopes closer to observe them more clearly. The pack was open. He brushed it and a yellow piece of paper slowly floated out of it.That paper was very thin and light. He couldn\u2019t tell what material it was made of, but there were strange designs drawn on the surface with red ink.Yu Zhengdu furrowed his brows. He bent over and leaned down to get a better look at that yellow paper. The designs on it were slightly familiar, almost as if he had seen them somewhere before. He scooted closer and closer. Finally, after great difficulty, he could almost clearly discern the designs. At this moment, though, that same, low voice sounded out from behind him once more. \u201cYu Zhengdu.\u201d\u201cWho are you?\u201d Yu Zhengdu reflexively turned around, just in time to see the man from before. He was still wearing the mask, but had taken the sungla.s.ses off. His exposed eyes were as sharp as an eagle\u2019s. They were coldly focused on him.Yu Zhengdu\u2019s heart suddenly skipped a beat.In that instant, he finally remembered. That yellow piece of paper was clearly the guiding talisman that Shang Que had told him about following Fan Li\u2019s death replacement incident.His expression darkened. He stared at the person before him and said lowly, \u201cJiang.\u201dThe other revealed the hint of a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty smart.\u201dYu Zhengdu kept his gaze locked on the other. He knew that he hadn\u2019t been smart enough.Jiang was a ghost.Just now, he had been a ghost, calling a spirit.And Yu Zhengdu, who had grabbed the guiding talisman, had just so happened to instinctively reply to his call.When Yu Zhengdu regained consciousness, he discovered that he was standing in the middle of the desolate wilderness.The night was dark. The moon was half-covered by dark clouds, revealing only a hazy white light. He turned around to observe his surroundings and noticed that his left was an endless expanse of emptiness. His right was a dark and shadowy forest. Starlight and moonlight slightly dappled through the trees; they were a ghostly blue or a ghastly white. Looking at them made one s.h.i.+ver with cold.A small river cut through the forest, travelling through the wilderness and flowing into the distance. That water was deep and dark. If one didn\u2019t listen carefully, they would barely be able to hear the sounds of water.Yu Zhengdu stood there for a bit. His brain finally, slowly started clearing up. The scene from prior to losing consciousness emerged in his mind.Guiding talisman, ghost calling a spirit.So now, he should be a spirit.He looked down at himself and discovered that he didn\u2019t look any different than he had in life. He was even still holding the four cups of milk tea in his hands.Yu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHaving worked at Luofeng for so long, he naturally knew that after death, human spirits would look exactly the same as they had in life. From clothing to posture to appliances, there were no differences. Otherwise, the Underworld would probably be filled with naked ghosts floating everywhere. However, he honestly hadn\u2019t thought that even the milk teas he had been holding would be able to transform into spirits with him.He thought about it, then pulled out his phone from his pocket. The phone right now was the Underworld version. He wanted to call Shang Que, but when he looked at the screen, he noticed that it only had 50% battery left. There was also no signal at all.Yu Zhengdu sighed, unsurprised. It was easy to tell from the surroundings alone that this was clearly an undeveloped, uninhabited area. Only, he didn\u2019t know where this was.To his left, was a vast wilderness. He couldn\u2019t see where it ended. There would be no purpose in walking toward it either. To his right, was a forest that looked slightly dangerous. In all honesty, if he had a choice, he definitely wouldn\u2019t choose to enter.But right now, he didn\u2019t have a choice. He couldn\u2019t just keep waiting in place.Yu Zhengdu pondered a bit before slowly turning around. While carrying the four cups of milk tea, he trekked along the side of the little black river, slowly walking into the forest.Unexpectedly, the forest wasn\u2019t as dark as it looked from outside. There were faint fires dotting the branches. They barely managed to provide enough light to see the forest.Rather strangely, though those fires produced light, they didn\u2019t produce any heat. They also didn\u2019t seem to be burning the branches at all.Yu Zhengdu very quickly reached a conclusion: these were most likely the legendary ghostly fires.And a forest that possessed a large quant.i.ty of ghostly fires meant that this was most likely not a simple undeveloped, uninhibited area.Yu Zhengdu\u2019s brain worked quickly. After calling his spirit, why hadn\u2019t that Jiang locked him up? Why had he left him here instead?Or, had Jiang put all the spirits of the other people he had tricked into finding death replacements, then performed ghost calling a spirit on, here too?Prior to this, Shang Que had once said that after successfully gaining a death replacement, those people who had found death replacements would be able to escape reincarnation. And, this place could be considered far from the mortal realm but not quite at the Underworld yet. If Jiang truly brought those spirits here, they truly would be undiscoverable by G.o.ds and ghosts alike.But what should he do now? Could Shang Que find him? Could he still go back?Yu Zhengdu was in the middle of blanking out when suddenly, a loud sound of \u201c hua \u2014\u2014\u201d erupted from nearby. Shortly after, it was followed by the sounds of waves cras.h.i.+ng. This scared him greatly.Yu Zhengdu\u2019s feet almost slipped out from under him. He hurriedly took two steps forward and looked into the river.Only to see the dark, black river suddenly become chaotic. Black water rose from the river and sprayed into the air.In the black waves, a large, black shadow the size of a small mountain jumped out from the river. Then, with an enormous thud, it landed on the sh.o.r.e. This caused the dirt under Yu Zhengdu\u2019s feet to vibrate too.Yu Zhengdu clenched his hands tightly into fists. His entire heart had practically already risen into his throat. He stared straight at the enormous black shadow before his eyes, preparing to run away at the first sign of danger.\u2026\u2026If he could.Only to see that black shadow slowly lift its head. Its head was very big. With the faint light from the ghostly fires surrounding them, Yu Zhengdu could only see its strangely large eyes.The other was looking at him too.Yu Zhengdu silently took a step back, preparing to run.And then, he heard the other open his mouth to say, \u201cDo you have food?\u201dThat voice was shrill and thin. It sounded like it had been squeezed out of a tiny hole with great difficulty.Yu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dIn his hesitation, the black shadow slowly approached. Yu Zhengdu could finally clearly see his appearance.Only to see that he was covered in blue skin with a large and fat belly. Like a small hill, his large body was topped by a similarly large head, as well as equally frighteningly large facial features.His gigantic eyes slowly lowered their gaze. Finally, they fell directly on the milk tea in Yu Zhengdu\u2019s hands. He used his thin and shrill voice to say, \u201cI smell it. The smell of food. The smell of delicious food.\u201dNow, Yu Zhengdu could finally confirm that this strange ghost creature didn\u2019t have intentions of attacking him. To be more accurate, what the creature was truly interested in was the milk tea in his hands, not him.Yu Zhengdu thought about it, then slowly held up the milk tea. He said, \u201cIf you want it, I can give this to you.\u201dUnexpectedly, as soon as he spoke, the other suddenly started wailing. \u201cWhat use is there if you give it to me! I can\u2019t eat it anyways!\u201dBlack tears streamed out of his huge, round eyes. If not for the fact that his physical appearance was too terrifying, he would truly seem very pitiful.Yu Zhengdu didn\u2019t know how he had offended the other. He couldn\u2019t help worrying that the other would attack him in embarra.s.sment. He hurriedly asked, \u201cWhy not?\u201d\u201cLook at my throat!\u201d That ghost creature angrily opened his big mouth and leaned over. He pointed at his own throat and said, \u201cNeedlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost, understand? My throat is as big as a needlepoint. How am I supposed to eat anything?!\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOnly to see that his throat was extremely, extremely small. So small that it was practically invisible. This was maybe the reason why his voice was so strange.Yu Zhengdu stared at that needle-like throat for a long time. Then, he looked down at the size of his own body and exhaled a long sigh of relief. \u201cNow I can rest at ease. You probably shouldn\u2019t be capable of eating me.\u201dNeedlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d<b>The author has something to say:</b>Shang Que: Where\u2019s my milk tea? Wait no. Where\u2019s my boyfriend?Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost: Are you even a human ?!Yu Zhengdu: Not anymore \u2513( \u2032\u2200` )\u250fPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74 - Hungry Ghost PathPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 74 - Hungry Ghost PathBlack tears started flowing out of Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost\u2019s big eyes again. His arms, that were as short as a T-rex\u2019s, struggled to reach his face and wipe away the tears. He cried, \u201cYou\u2019re too much. You dare to mock me!\u201dYu Zhengdu hadn\u2019t expected that this ghost would be so sensitive. He hurriedly explained, \u201cNo, no, that\u2019s not what I meant. I was just worried that you would eat me.\u201dNeedlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost finally stopped crying upon hearing this. He glared at the other for a bit before suddenly asking, \u201cYou\u2019re a ghost from out of town, right?\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201cWhy? I have a foreign accent?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not it,\u201d Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost started. \u201cOnly ghosts from out of town are worried that they\u2019ll get eaten. If you were a local ghost, you would know that we don\u2019t eat anything.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so hungry.\u201d As he spoke, he started crying again. While tears streamed down his face, he didn\u2019t forget to keep staring at Yu Zhengdu\u2019s milk tea. \u201cI\u2019m really very hungry. I want to eat so bad, but I can\u2019t! Wuwuwu\u2014\u2014\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t cry anymore, don\u2019t cry anymore.\u201d Yu Zhengdu realized that this ghost was like a little kid. He wasn\u2019t all that mature, so Yu Zhengdu hurriedly comforted the other, incredibly stressed.He thought about it, then stuck a straw in a cup of milk tea and handed it over. \u201cThis is a drink. Do you want to try and see if you can drink it?\u201d\u201cCan I drink it?\u201d Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost blinked before tentatively receiving the milk tea and taking a sip.The next second, Yu Zhengdu witnessed his big eyes become starry-eyed. \u201cAo\u2014\u2014 so delicious, so so so delicious. I\u2019ve never had anything so delicious before\u2014\u2014\u201dYu Zhengdu gazed at the milk tea that hadn\u2019t seemed to decrease in the slightest and carefully asked, \u201cYou\u2019re sure you drank some?\u201dNeedlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost furiously nodded. \u201cEven though I only drank a little bit, it was very fragrant and very sweet. Is this jade dew syrup from the Heavens?\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026Your description is a bit exaggerated. This is milk tea.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost hummed as he chewed something. A while later, he spat out a black blob. His gaze was filled with sorrow. \u201cThis is so fun to chew! Unfortunately, I can\u2019t swallow it. I\u2019m so sad, I want to eat!\u201d\u201cThese are pearls.\u201d Yu Zhengdu watched as Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost incessantly slurped at the milk tea. He worried that if they continued talking about this topic, the conversation would never end. Thus, he hurriedly asked, \u201cOh right, where are we?\u201dNeedlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost blinked. \u201cThe area near my house.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu waved his hands. \u201cI mean, what\u2019s the address for this area? Which province, which city, which mountain?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t understand your question.\u201d Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost scratched his head. \u201cWe don\u2019t have an address. I\u2019ve never been anywhere else either.\u201dYu Zhengdu continued to inquire, \u201cThen are there people where you live?\u201dThe current matter at hand was to first find someplace where there were people. Only then would he be able to discover where he was.Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost\u2019s expression was bewildered. \u201cWhat people? There are no people here. They\u2019re all ghosts.\u201dYu Zhengdu finally realized what was wrong. With furrowed eyebrows, he asked, \u201cWait. There are no people? Then where did the ghosts come from?\u201dNeedlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost: \u201cBorn, obviously. Weren\u2019t you?\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOf course not. Normal ghosts were the deceased spirits of living people. He had never seen a ghost that had been born as a ghost.Yu Zhengdu\u2019s heart suddenly became cold. He had a faint idea, but couldn\u2019t be sure. He only asked, \u201cWhere are the other ghosts, then?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t know. They didn\u2019t listen to Mom and ran off by themselves. I don\u2019t know where they went.\u201d Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost tilted his head. \u201cYou have a lot of questions. How about you just go ask my mom? She knows a lot, so can give you answers.\u201d\u201cYour mom?\u201d Yu Zhengdu was a bit guarded. \u201cThe one who gave birth to you?\u201d\u201cYep,\u201d Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost nodded. \u201cShe told me stories about lots of other places. Maybe she\u2019ll know about the address you were talking about.\u201dIn his heart, Yu Zhengdu was actually against seeing a creature that could give birth to ghosts. But he had no other choice. He could only tentatively ask first, \u201cIs she friendly towards foreign ghosts?\u201dNeedlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost led him along the black river, further into the forest. \u201cShe is! She likes treating foreign ghosts to meals. She\u2019ll definitely be very happy to see you.\u201dYu Zhengdu heaved a secret sigh of relief. \u201cYour mom seems pretty welcoming. Then how did those other foreign ghosts leave this place?\u201d\u201cNone of them left.\u201d Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost tilted his head to glance at Yu Zhengdu. He very naturally stated, \u201cThey didn\u2019t like the food my mom made, so she ripped them into pieces.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026?!\u201dYu Zhengdu turned on his feet, intending to run. However, before he could do anything, Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost pressed down on his shoulder with his tiny arm.Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost: \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201dYu Zhengdu lost his balance because of this. He was in the middle of coming up with an excuse, but it was already too late. Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost lifted his other hand to wave. He shouted, \u201cMom, I\u2019m back.\u201dThe raspy voice of a woman sounded out from the depths of the forest. Her tone was a bit displeased, \u201cNeedlepoint? Didn\u2019t I tell you to hide in the water and not make yourself known? How come you\u2019re wandering around again?\u201dNeedlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost shrunk into his neck. \u201cI met a ghost from out of town. He has questions to ask you.\u201d\u201cFrom out of town?\u201d The woman\u2019s voice instantly became excited. \u201cLet me see.\u201dAt the same time, Yu Zhengdu, who couldn\u2019t move because he was being held down, couldn\u2019t help looking in the direction Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost was pointing.Through layers and layers of branches and leaves, he saw an area of emptiness in the deepest area of the forest. Half the moon hung over that vast sky. The hazy moonlight lit up the earth, illuminating an enormous black lake. It was connected to the black river. In the middle of the lake was a little island. On top of the island was a cottage, surrounded by ghostly fires. He could faintly discern smoke rising from the chimney of the cottage.Only to hear a creak as the door to the cottage became pushed open. A short, plump woman wearing an ap.r.o.n over common clothes walked out. From across the lake, her gaze fell onto Yu Zhengdu\u2019s figure. There was obvious excitement in her eyes. \u201cWe really have a guest . Come come come, come sit inside.\u201dYu Zhengdu was a bit surprised. He had a.s.sumed that a ghost big enough to give birth to a huge ghost like Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost would be very scary, but in reality, this woman looked quite normal. She seemed like an ordinary woman that could be seen in any village in the mortal realm.He was just about to give a greeting when he heard Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost scoot closer and whisper, \u201cMy mom\u2019s pretending to be a human again. She definitely wants to treat you to a meal. Remember to praise her, okay? Otherwise, you\u2019ll die.\u201dYu Zhengdu stared at him, astounded, \u201cThis isn\u2019t your mom\u2019s normal appearance?\u201d\u201cOf course not,\u201d Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost shushed him. \u201cDo you think someone who looks like that could give birth to a ghost who looks like me?\u201dYu Zhengdu expressionlessly answered, \u201c\u2026\u2026You\u2019re right.\u201dThe woman waved at them, \u201cHurry and come.\u201dYu Zhengdu gazed at the enormous black lake in front of him. He had just started wondering if he could reject the invitation on the basis that he couldn\u2019t swim when he noticed Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost directly jump into the lake. The other pointed at his thick back and said, \u201cCome up. I\u2019ll carry you over.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201cYou\u2019re truly too kind.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s what I should do.\u201d Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost blinked his big eyes, then balanced the milk tea on his own head. \u201cYou gave me this too, right?\u201dYu Zhengdu had no other option. He could only sigh softly and slowly climb onto Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost\u2019s back, allowing the other to give him a piggyback ride. They swam past the black lake; during the trip, Yu Zhengdu finally discovered that there was actually a mire atop the lake. No wonder it looked so black.When they reached the small island at the heart of the lake, the woman led Yu Zhengdu inside with a smile. She asked, \u201cHow did you get here?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know either,\u201d Yu Zhengdu answered honestly.\u201cOh, so you probably got lost.\u201d The woman seemed rather apathetic. She told Yu Zhengdu to sit at a very simple table, then walked into a different room by herself. \u201cThough this place is very remote, there will occasionally be absentminded ghosts who barge in.\u201dYu Zhengdu brought up his original question again, \u201cMay I ask what this place actually is?\u201dThe woman\u2019s laughter seemed a bit eerie. \u201cDon\u2019t you know?\u201dYu Zhengdu didn\u2019t respond.\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about that right now. You should be hungry, right? How about eating something first?\u201d The woman walked out of the room with a tray in her hands. Three plates and two bowls rested on the tray. Cheerfully, she said, \u201cWhat a coincidence. I just so happened to finish making dinner. Come try my cooking.\u201dShe set down the tray, revealing three plates of mush \u2013 Yu Zhengdu couldn\u2019t tell what the original ingredients had been at all \u2013 and two bowls of rice.Yu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dNo wonder Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost said that previously, no foreign ghosts had enjoyed his mother\u2019s cooking.Only to see Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost\u2019s originally blue face abruptly turn green . The woman grabbed a bowl of rice and filled it up with mush, then forced it into his hand. \u201cNeedlepoint, you eat too.\u201dNeedlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost widened his eyes. He pointed at his tiny, needlepoint-sized throat and cried, \u201cMom, have you forgotten? I can\u2019t eat.\u201d\u201cThen smell it!\u201d The woman aggressively yelled. \u201cThis is a new dish that I just came up with today. You need to sniff it with all you\u2019ve got.\u201dNeedlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost received the bowl with shaking hands and pitifully lowered his head to start sniffing the food.The women then plated another portion and stuffed it into Yu Zhengdu\u2019s hands. \u201cHere, you try some too.\u201dYu Zhengdu accepted the food and felt that his entire ghostly being was on the verge of being not okay. Disregarding the taste, he highly suspected that if he bit into this thing, he could instantly become poisoned back to life.\u201cHurry and eat!\u201d The woman stared at him diligently. Upon noticing his hesitation, the smile on her face grew fainter and fainter. Her fingers continuously twitched, snapping and popping with every move. \u201cWhat? You think the food I made isn\u2019t good?\u201d\u201cNo, no.\u201d Yu Zhengdu prodded at the blackish blob and forced himself to calm down. \u201cI\u2019m just curious as to what this dish is. I\u2019ve never seen it before.\u201d\u201cThis is stir-fried ghost shark meat. It doesn\u2019t exist anywhere else.\u201d The woman eerily stared at him. \u201cI just fished it out of the mud. It\u2019s very fresh. Don\u2019t you dare to eat some?\u201d\u201cOf course. There isn\u2019t anything that us Huaxia ghosts don\u2019t dare to eat.\u201d Yu Zhengdu started spouting lies with a straight face, \u201cHowever, us modern ghosts have three highs. My doctor told me not to eat anything stir-fried.\u201dThe woman slightly narrowed her eyes. \u201cWhat are these \u2018three highs\u2019?\u201d\u201cIt means high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and high blood sugar,\u201d Yu Zhengdu explained. Upon seeing the woman reveal a confused expression, he started lecturing her about the concepts behind the three highs. At the end, he said, \u201c\u2026\u2026That\u2019s basically it. Right now, ghosts have too much pressure. We can\u2019t even completely relax in death. We still have to take care of our health.\u201d\u201cI hadn\u2019t expected that there would be so many nuances to being a ghost these days,\u201d the woman lamented. Then, she glanced darkly at Yu Zhengdu again. \u201cBut why do I feel like you\u2019re trying to fool me?\u201dAs expected, this ghost wasn\u2019t as easy to trick as Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost was!Fortunately, Yu Zhengdu already had a plan in mind. He instantly pulled out his phone and turned it on, expression calm. \u201cI\u2019m really not. See, this is a reference list of recipes that the doctor gave me. He told me to strictly follow it and not to deviate from it in the slightest.\u201dAccording to his plan, he needed to drag things out for as long as possible. If he truly couldn\u2019t keep fooling her, he would just take a bite out of the food. Either way, death was inevitable.Fortunately, though, the gourmet food recipe powerpoint he had previously made for the fake Fan Li\u2019s interrogation was still on his phone. While opening the powerpoint, he asked, \u201cThe ghost\u2026\u2026ghost shark you spoke of? What kind of creature is that?\u201dWhen he took out his phone and the screen lit up, the woman and Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost scooted closer curiously. The woman said, \u201cIt\u2019s a type of fish.\u201d\u201cOh, I have the 50 different ways of cooking fish here.\u201d Yu Zhengdu swiped the powerpoint to the next slide and handed his phone over to the woman. \u201cTake a look. The doctor recommended that I only eat sas.h.i.+mi and steamed fish, making sure to avoid deep-fried or stir-fried fish.\u201dAt this time, both the woman and Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost\u2019s attentions were completely focused on the phone. They wholly disregarded what Yu Zhengdu was saying.The woman refused to let go of the phone now that she was holding it. She asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201dNeedlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost was preoccupied by something entirely different from his mother. Drool dripped out from his mouth. \u201cAre these all foods? They all look so delicious. I\u2019m so hungry, I want to eat so bad\u2014\u2014\u201dThe woman pushed him away and held the phone up to Yu Zhengdu, asking once more, \u201cWhat is this?\u201dNow, Yu Zhengdu finally realized that she truly seemed to not recognize the phone. He thought about their surroundings and instantly understood that since they were separated from the rest of the world, they probably didn\u2019t know anything about several new technological advancements. After understanding this, Yu Zhengdu answered, \u201cThis is a cell phone.\u201dOnly to see the woman\u2019s expression became bewildered. Thus, Yu Zhengdu explained it to her and also taught her the concepts behind the Internet.After he finished speaking, the woman was already completely astounded. She seemed slightly surprised but also slightly sorrowful. A pause later, she slowly muttered, \u201cSo the mortal realm has already changed so much.\u201dHer voice was barely discernible. Yu Zhengdu didn\u2019t know who she was talking to either.Yu Zhengdu caught the hidden meaning in her words. He tentatively asked, \u201cYou just mentioned the mortal realm? So this isn\u2019t the mortal realm?\u201dThe woman slowly lifted her head, revealing a creepy smile. \u201cYou still don\u2019t know where we are now?\u201dYu Zhengdu fell silent for a moment before finally saying those three words: \u201cHungry Ghost Path.\u201dNot long after Yu Zhengdu had joined Luofeng, he had once taken care of a case with Shang Que regarding runaway evil ghosts from the Fu City Ancient Well Reincarnation Point. In the end, Shang Que had thrown the spirit of the serial killer, Hong Gentou, into the Hungry Ghost Path.This seemed to be the greatest punishment h.e.l.l could give to these felon ghosts after the Heavens and earth had collapsed.Because of this, Yu Zhengdu had secretly researched the Hungry Ghost Path in private.The Hungry Ghost Path was one of the Six Paths of Reincarnation. According to legend, it overlapped with the mortal realm and only contained forests and empty plains. However, the eyes of mortals were unable to see it.The inhabitants of the Hungry Ghost Path were all born from the womb. In their previous lives, they had all accrued bad karma. In this life, they were all born from a ghost mother. Their lives could last tens of thousands of years, and for this entire time, they were required to suffer through the pain and punishments of their bad karma. At every moment, they endured the torment of extreme hunger.Such as needlepoint-throated hungry ghosts. They had stomachs as big as valleys, but their throats were only the size of needlepoints. No matter how much delicious food you gave them, they wouldn\u2019t be able to swallow it. They could only stare at the food and smell the scent. Every day, they felt burning hunger. It was an indescribable kind of pain.Other hungry ghosts had huge bodies but extremely thin and small feet. This made it hard for their feet to carry their body weight, so when they saw food, they could only barely manage to approach it. However, because of their bad karma, when they finally managed to get close to the food, the food would turn into a mult.i.tude of inedible objects.There were also hungry ghosts who could blow fire. Even if they could somehow swallow food, this food wouldn\u2019t fill their stomachs up. Instead, it would cause their stomachs to burn; this was extremely painful.And the flames he had seen in the wilderness and abandoned forest were the residual fires blown out by these hungry ghosts.After learning that Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost had been born as a ghost, he had already had a small inkling in his heart. However, he hadn\u2019t dared to confirm anything until the woman before his eyes had outright stated that this wasn\u2019t the mortal realm.So the woman in front of him was the ghost mother of the Hungry Ghost Path.Then what was Jiang\u2019s ident.i.ty? Why could he so easily exile him to the Hungry Ghost Path? What did he need to do to leave?Yu Zhengdu fell deep into thought. However, Ghost Mother ignored him. Instead, she and Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost b.u.mped heads, squeezing to see the phone screen.Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost\u2019s eyes had already turned green . \u201cMom, this dish looks so delicious. Can you make it for me to smell?\u201d\u201cAnd this one, this one, plus this one. Wuwuwuwu, everything looks so delicious. I\u2019m so hungry, I want to eat so bad!\u201dWhile looking at the phone, Ghost Mother slapped Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost\u2019s head. \u201cYou deserve it. Who told you to be a bad person in your past life. Otherwise, you wouldn\u2019t have reincarnated here in the first place. Now, you\u2019re supposed to repent everyday to decrease your bad karma, but you keep slacking off!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to repent, \u201d Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost said while hugging his head. \u201cBut I don\u2019t have any motivation to\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean you have no motivation?!!\u201d Ghost Mother was so angry she placed her hands on her hips and scolded, \u201cEvery day, I work so hard to cook food for you simply to provide you motivation, right? Don\u2019t you feel stimulated by the smell of food and want to immediately decrease your bad karma so you can leave the Hungry Ghost Path and go eat?\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe gazed at the unidentified food that Ghost Mother had brought over and could only say that Ghost Mother had a very great misunderstanding of how good her own cooking was.Smelling such dishes every day probably wouldn\u2019t cause anyone to generate a desire for eating food.Only to see Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost stare at the pictures of food on the phone, drool continuously dripping out of his mouth. He loudly wailed, \u201cI have motivation now. I want to go to the mortal realm, I want to drink milk tea, I want to eat all fifty different ways of cooking chicken!\u201dGhost Mother: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d<b>The author has something to say:</b>Chicken: We were both people who did bad things in our past lives. What have I done extra wrong?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If twenty four hours actually pa.s.sed, he would really be done for. While Ghost Mother seemed to be in a good mood, he asked, \u201cMay I ask what I have to do to leave the Hungry Ghost Path?\u201dGhost Mother lifted her gaze from the phone to glare at Yu Zhengdu. Suddenly, she burst into laughter. \u201cYou\u2019re still thinking about leaving?\u201dYu Zhengdu froze. \u201cCan\u2019t I?\u201dGhost Mother stared at him for a long time before abruptly spinning the phone in her hands. \u201cThis is called a phone, right? From now on, it belongs to me.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d = =But the situation was out of his control. Yu Zhengdu was forced to nod, \u201c\u2026\u2026Okay.\u201dGhost Mother instantly became happier. She no longer obligated Yu Zhengdu to eat anymore. Cheerily, she said, \u201cWith these recipes, I don\u2019t believe that I won\u2019t be able to enlighten my unmotivated hungry ghost sons in the future.\u201dUpon seeing this, Yu Zhengdu couldn\u2019t help sighing to himself,\u201cBecause you\u2019re so sensible, I\u2019ll tell you the truth.\u201d Ghost Mother put the phone away and told Yu Zhengdu, \u201cDon\u2019t even bother thinking about how to leave the Hungry Ghost Path. With that kind of time on your hands, you might as well wonder how you\u2019re going to survive in the Hungry Ghost Path in the future.\u201d\u201cAre you going to stay here?\u201d Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost used his short little hands to clap off to the side. \u201cThat\u2019s great. I\u2019m finally going to have a friend from now on.\u201dYu Zhengdu didn\u2019t seem even the slightest bit excited about making a new friend. His expression became solemn. \u201cWhat does that mean? Could it be that there are no ways to return to the mortal realm?\u201d\u201cReturn to what mortal realm?\u201d Ghost Mother cackled. She glanced outside the cottage at the dark forest and blue ghostly fires. \u201cThis is the mortal realm.\u201dThe Hungry Ghost Path and mortal realm were layered atop one another. The Hungry Ghost Path was in the mortal realm, only, those in the mortal realm couldn\u2019t see the Hungry Ghost Path and those in the Hungry Ghost Path couldn\u2019t see the mortal realm.This path had been created because of the ignorance of all living beings. The karma of all living beings could oppose Mount Meru , could emerge victorious against the largest ocean, could obstruct the n.o.ble Path .The ghosts in this path had once debauched their morals, committing crimes of the body, crimes of speech, and crimes of thought. In this lifetime, they would be submerged here in intense pain. The only way to escape this path was to repent day and night, gathering good karma to erase the sins from the past life. This way, they would be able to reincarnate.However, the beings of this path were often tormented by starvation and extreme thirst. They did everything they could for food, minds muddled and unable to determine right from wrong. Additionally, there were no opportunities for them to do good. Thus, they could only suffer the consequences of their karma day after day, living out their long and pained ghostly lives. When their suffering and pain eventually balanced out their bad karma, they would finally be allowed to return to the paths of reincarnation.This was the only way to escape the Hungry Ghost Path. But for Yu Zhengdu, this only solution couldn\u2019t even be used either, because he didn\u2019t originally belong to this path. Thus, there was no way he could reincarnate from it.\u201cSince historical times, Underworld spirits have often accidentally entered the Hungry Ghost Path. However, a thousand years ago, there truly was one person who opened the enchanted barriers to the Hungry Ghost Path and saved those innocent spirits.\u201d Ghost Mother gazed at Yu Zhengdu. \u201cWhat a pity. That person no longer exists anymore. From what I know, these days, the Heavens and h.e.l.l have already collapsed. If you can only search in the mortal realm, there is no ent.i.ty strong enough to open the Hungry Ghost Path. So\u2026\u2026\u201dA hint of pity appeared in her eyes. \u201cJust obediently stay in the Hungry Ghost Path.\u201dYu Zhengdu\u2019s heart went cold. \u201cThere\u2019s no other way?\u201d\u201cThere is.\u201d Ghost Mother\u2019s smile became even more wretched. \u201cProvide salvation for all the beings in the Hungry Ghost Path. Make the Hungry Ghost Path disappear.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019d better start thinking of ways to open the enchanted barriers.\u201d\u201cYou?\u201d Ghost Mother started cackling again. \u201cI urge you to give up on such a goal. It\u2019d be impossible for you to open the barriers. Might as well figure out these recipes with me instead.\u201dYu Zhengdu tensed. He said, \u201cIf the barriers cannot be opened, then how did I end up in here?\u201dHis words seemed to have caused Ghost Mother to remember something. Only to see Ghost Mother furrow her brows and reveal a confused expression. \u201cSpeaking of, recently, the Hungry Ghost Path truly has become very strange\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cStrange in what way?\u201d Yu Zhengdu asked.Ghost Mother was just about to start speaking when they suddenly heard a loud \u201chuhu\u2014\u2014\u201d from outside. A wild, out of the ordinary, gust of wind blew past, causing the cottage to shake incessantly. The door rattled in place, almost as if the entire room was only a second away from being swept up into the sky.Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost was so scared he dropped under the table and covered his head. He cried, \u201cMom, didi is back again. I\u2019m so scared!\u201d\u201cYou have a didi?\u201d Yu Zhengdu\u2019s expression was bewildered upon hearing this. \u201cWhy are you scared that your didi\u2019s back?\u201d\u201cHis didi is Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost. I gave birth to him a few months ago.\u201d Ghost Mother\u2019s gaze darkened. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the things that has become strange in the Hungry Ghost Path.\u201dYu Zhengdu furrowed his brows. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dGhost Mother: \u201cLook outside.\u201dCurrently, the cottage door had already been blown open by the wind. From outside the door, they could barely make out the trees in the forest that had been blown into forty-five degree angles because of the roaring wind. And then, with a \u201chong\u2014\u2014\u201d, the original darkness outside suddenly became illuminated by fire. Like agile snakes, stream after stream of fire abruptly appeared from far away, causing the area surrounding the cottage to become as bright as day.After those large flames, an enormous black shadow almost the size of the trees slowly emerged from the forest. His voice was raspy and low, bringing with it an indescribable chill. \u201cMom, I\u2019m back. Have you given birth to any didis or meimeis for me recently?\u201dTorch-Throated Hungry Ghost: body as big as a Bodhi tree, flames bursting from its mouth. After ingesting food, the food would instantly turn into fire, causing its stomach to be consumed by burning. These ghosts were destined to forever feel hungry and parched.Ghost Mother took a step forward, blocking Yu Zhengdu and Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost from view. She glared at the black shadow outside and coldly said, \u201cTorch, haven\u2019t I told you already? I won\u2019t care what you do anymore, as long as you never come back.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to make things difficult for you either,\u201d Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost said. \u201cBut I\u2019m so hungry. Recently, there haven\u2019t been any new ghosts at all. It\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve eaten, Mom. Take pity on me. Hurry and give birth to a few didis and meimeis for me to eat, okay? Otherwise, you can also give Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost to me to eat\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu only felt chills run down his body. He looked at Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost in shock, softly asking, \u201cYour didi eats ghosts? And eats his own brothers and sisters?\u201dNeedlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost trembled from where he was hiding under the table. Upon hearing this question, he still didn\u2019t dare to make a noise. He only carefully nodded.Ghost Mother: \u201cTorch, what you\u2019re doing now is increasing your bad karma. If this carries on, you will be trapped in the Hungry Ghost Path forever, never able to reincarnate.\u201d\u201cHahahahaha, Mom, you think I don\u2019t know?\u201d Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost asked. \u201cThere\u2019s another way to leave the Hungry Ghost Path\u2026\u2026\u201dIn the flames, Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost slowly revealed his features. His entire body was ashen white; there were long furs on his face. Sharp fangs could be seen in his opened mouth. As he opened and closed his mouth, fire continuously sprayed out.Yu Zhengdu abruptly widened his eyes. Not because of Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost\u2019s terrifying appearance, but because that face was one he recognized.At the beginning of the year, the escaped Minan serial killer at the Ancient Well Reincarnation Point, Hong Gentou, had transformed into a malicious ghost and ultimately been thrown into the Hungry Ghost Path.This Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost looked exactly like Hong Gentou after he had become a malicious ghostk2026;k2026;Of course, he had clearly already evolved to the point of being able to blow fire now.In accordance with when Ghost Mother gave birth to Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost, this directly coincided with the time Hong Gentou had been thrown into the Hungry Ghost Path.Yu Zhengdu\u2019s throat tightened. A true evil ghost would be an evil ghost regardless of where they ended up.At this time, Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost had also discovered his presence. His dark, resentful eyes slightly narrowed. He stared for a bit, then slowly licked his lips, revealing a malignant smile. \u201cI remember you. So he really managed to get you here\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu latched onto the clues in his speech. He furrowed his brows and asked, \u201cWho is \u2018he\u2019? Jiang?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you know yet?\u201d Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost squatted down. Across the black lake, his head was still frighteningly large. It almost took up all the empty s.p.a.ce left by the door. He was like a cat awaiting a mouse: not in a rush at all. In a teasing tone, he said, \u201cOriginally, he could always manage to get the spirits of those stupid death replacers for us to eat every month. What method did you use? To cause those people who were looking for death replacements to all fail? He couldn\u2019t catch any more spirits, so could only catch you and bring you here.\u201dThe ill intent in his smile became more and more obvious. He also seemed quite pleased. \u201cIf there\u2019s anyone to blame, that\u2019d be yourself. You thought you were so smart, but actually set yourself up for failure. Just like when you guys threw me into the Hungry Ghost Path back then. You thought that you would be able to torture me. Didn\u2019t expect me to become even stronger, right?\u201dFollowing Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost\u2019s words, Yu Zhengdu slowly organized the hints in his mind.So the reason Jiang had kept collecting the spirits of those people who had found death replacements was to place them in the Hungry Ghost Path to feed these ghosts. But after the Life and Death Accounts system had gone online, Luofeng had basically entirely ended all possibility for death replacements. Jiang could no longer find any spirits hidden from h.e.l.l\u2019s searches. No wonder he hated him and had called his spirit away to throw into the Hungry Ghost Path despite the threat of being discovered by h.e.l.l.However, there was one thing Yu Zhengdu couldn\u2019t understand. Why was Jiang feeding the hungry ghosts here? What was his goal?Compared to Yu Zhengdu, Ghost Mother was much more surprised. She stared at Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost and yelled, \u201cTorch, why can you remember the events of your past life?\u201dThough the hungry ghosts born into the Hungry Ghost Path also had the five supernatural faculties just as normal Underworld spirits did, their purvenivasa.n.u.smrti abilities were very limited. They couldn\u2019t see too far into the past and could only barely remember that they had committed wrongdoings in a past life, resulting in such punishment.They definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to remember as clearly as Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost could.\u201cMom, have you not discovered yet?\u201d Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost slowly turned to look at Ghost Mother. \u201cIn the Hungry Ghost Path right now, I\u2019m not the only ghost who remembers their past life.\u201d\u201cWho did it?\u201d Ghost Mother\u2019s gaze became colder and darker. \u201cWhat else do you know?\u201d\u201cHahahahahahaha,\u201d Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost leaned back again and cackled wildly. \u201cI also know that as long as I eat a thousand ghosts, I\u2019ll be able to become a Heinous Ghost. Then, I\u2019ll have the power to pa.s.s through the Great Netherworld Sea and return to the mortal realm.\u201dGhost Mother\u2019s expression abruptly changed. \u201cWho is the one who told you these things?\u201d\u201cBeing a hungry ghost is really so painful and tormenting\u2026\u2026\u201d Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost ignored Ghost Mother. He returned his gaze onto Yu Zhengdu, eyes filled with boundless desire for revenge. \u201cI\u2019m so hungry, truly so hungry. While on the run as a human, I once went three days and three nights without eating. But that doesn\u2019t compare to now. Each bite I eat turns into magma that burns me from inside. Every drink I take turns into lava that travels through my intestines\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd I\u2019ll never forget who sent me to this place. Even if my stomach burns with extreme pain every time I eat a ghost, I will still eat them one by one. I want to return to the mortal realm and find you guys for revenge\u2014\u2014\u201dBy the end, his voice was filled with endless hatred.Under his frightening gaze, Yu Zhengdu maintained a rare calm. Expression unchanged, he said, \u201cThis evil ghost, I hope that you can take a good look at something. You got thrown into the Hungry Ghost Path because you yourself did wrong. It has nothing to do with anyone else.\u201d\u201cHehehehehe\u2026\u2026\u201d Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost naturally wouldn\u2019t listen to his words. He wildly laughed. \u201cI told Jiang that leaving you in the mortal realm would definitely bring continuous trouble. Why not capture you and bring you here for me to eat? This way, things can end once and for all\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d He had been confused. Cleaning out the death replacement phenomena mainly relied on the system. He hadn\u2019t actually shown his face before. How could Jiang so accurately pinpoint him? So it turns out this was because Hong Gentou had tattled on him.He guessed that Hong Gentou might not even be completely sure about the true sequence of events. He had only been determined to publicly take revenge for personal matters.After Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost finished speaking, he vigorously shook his head. He opened his mouth and released a startling roar. Following his roar, a gust of wild wind blew out of his mouth. Only to hear sounds of \u201chualala.\u201d The cottage Yu Zhengdu and them were in, along with all the furniture, suddenly got swept up into the sky. Things flew everywhere.Yu Zhengdu shook vigorously because of that wind and almost got swept away. Fortunately, at this critical moment, Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost \u2013 who had been hiding under the table \u2013 lunged over and grabbed his ankle. He used his own enormous body to barely manage to stabilize the other.\u201cHahahahaha, I\u2019m determined to see if there\u2019s anyone who can save you this time\u2014\u2014\u201d Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost took a step into the black lake and reached out his hairy hands in the direction of Yu Zhengdu.Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost started wailing in fright. \u201cMom, hurry and save Milk Tea Didi\u2014\u2014\u201dYu Zhengdu: = =In the violent wind, Ghost Mother took a step forward and spread her arms. She suddenly opened her mouth. With a roar, a stream of blackish-purple venom sprayed out from her mouth, landing on Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost\u2019s arm.Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost hadn\u2019t thought that Ghost Mother would act. In a moment of surprise, the venom hit its target. His arm instantly blistered frighteningly. He quickly pulled his arm back, expression livid. \u201cMom, what is the meaning of this?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t call me Mom. You have the memories of your past life. You\u2019re not my son.\u201d Ghost Mother\u2019s gaze was ice cold. \u201cI absolutely refuse to tolerate hungry ghosts who still have their past memories remaining in the Hungry Ghost Path.\u201dThe Hungry Ghost Path was originally a place to allow previously evil people to repent and wash away their sins. However, these hungry ghosts with their memories often wouldn\u2019t feel regret. Instead, they would bring even more bad karma to the Hungry Ghost Path.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be my mom anymore?\u201d Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost stood up. His body was as big as a Bodhi tree, causing a gigantic shadow to fall over Yu Zhengdu. \u201cJust as well. I\u2019ll eat you and Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost too. I\u2019ll help you get rid of the pain of extreme hunger.\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost shook while burying his face in the ground. \u201cDidi, you can\u2019t be like this\u2014\u2014\u201dBut how could Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost listen to him? His body grew bigger and bigger. \u201cAll those that have captured me and harmed me, I won\u2019t let a single one of them go\u2014\u2014\u201dBoth his hands were like two enormous doors. They swung powerfully from both sides, desiring to smash together.His palms got closer and closer to each other, bringing with them a sweeping wind. If not for the fact that Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost was holding onto Yu Zhengdu\u2019s legs, he wouldn\u2019t even be able to stand up straight, not to mention escape.He could practically predict the instant that he was going to be smacked into a spirit pancake. At this moment, though, the nails of Ghost Mother\u2019s right hand suddenly grew exponentially. In only the blink of an eye, they had already reached a length of greater than a foot. Connected to Ghost Mother\u2019s tiny body, this looked extremely strange.However, those nails were impossibly hard, long, and sharp. Only to see Ghost Mother reach a hand out and wave, piercing towards Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost palm at an incredible speed. The nails instantly stabbed through his palm.Black blood poured out, turning the dirt of the little island black as well.\u201cHuhu\u2014\u2014\u201d Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost howled. His furry face abruptly became extremely grotesque. He shouted, \u201cYou think you\u2019ll be able to take me on like this?\u201dHe released a growl and raised both hands into the air. Using Ghost Mother\u2019s nails, he picked her up too.\u201cLet the flames in my throat burn you into ash\u2014\u2014\u201dTorch-Throated Hungry Ghost\u2019s huge head leaned back. The crescent moon in the sky illuminated every single one of the hairs on his face. His mouth was open as wide as possible. Stinky, sticky saliva coated his fangs. He appeared almost as if he were a giant monster opening his beastly mouth. He lifted Ghost Mother so that she was above his mouth.\u201cAaah, Mom\u2014\u2014\u201d Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost wailed, attempting to charge forward. But it was already too late.Ghost Mother had already been lowered right next to Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost\u2019s lips.In the moonlight, the clothes on the woman\u2019s body suddenly ripped open. At the same time, her body rapidly expanded, growing bigger and bigger. Quite soon, Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost could no longer support her body weight. He could only howl and throw her away.With a loud \u201cdong\u2014\u2014\u201d, Ghost Mother landed in the forest on the other side, crus.h.i.+ng a small patch of trees.As all the ghosts watched, she slowly stood up. At this time, she had already become the same size as Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost.Only to see that she was completely undressed. Her skin was dark and rough, full of large b.u.mps. Her legs were a mix between those of a tiger and those of a dragon. Her enormous head was filled with terrifying facial features. The nails on her right hand were still impossibly long, but now, these nails didn\u2019t seem so strange compared to her body size. Her left hand, though, also contained a huge mouth. It had the same fangs as Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost.Ghost Mother, also known as Ghost Aunt G.o.ddess, had the paws of a tiger and dragon, the eyebrows of a python, and the eyes of a jiao .Only now did Yu Zhengdu realize: the appearances and skills of the hungry ghosts of the Hungry Ghost Path were all inherited from their mother.Ghost Mother sprayed out a sticky, smelly venom from her mouth. She leapt up and landed on Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost.Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost removed his feet from the black lake and charged at Ghost Mother as well.Two gargantuan evil ghosts fought in the forest, causing the trees to shake as if in the middle of an earthquake. With the naked eye, it was easy to tell that trees were incessantly being knocked down as their battle carried on. A chilly wind rushed past, bringing with it that foul odor. This almost caused Yu Zhengdu to vomit on the spot.During the fight, they heard Ghost Mother release a disbelieving shout, \u201cImpossible, you can\u2019t possibly defeat me\u2014\u2014\u201dTorch-Throated Hungry Ghost\u2019s brazen laughter shook the earth. \u201cYou don\u2019t know yet, right? I\u2019ve already eaten nine hundred ninety nine ghosts. As long as I can eat one more, n.o.body in the Hungry Ghost Path will be able to do anything about me anymore.\u201dFollowing his declaration, he caught Ghost Mother with both hands and lifted her high into the sky, then tossed her over.With a loud \u201cdong\u2014\u2014\u201d, Ghost Mother landed in the black lake, causing enormous waves of black water and mud to splash out. This mixture landed all over Yu Zhengdu and Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost.Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost\u2019s voice covered the entirety of the s.p.a.ce above the forest. It closely pressured them. \u201cYou thought that just because you hid your ghostly offspring away, I wouldn\u2019t have any ghosts to eat?\u201d\u201cIf not for the fact that I\u2019m only one step away from success, why would I let you know that I still have my past memories?\u201dGhost Mother\u2019s roar was long and sorrowful. \u201cWho? Who gave you ghosts to eat? Who is keeping Heinous Ghosts in the Hungry Ghost Path?\u201dYu Zhengdu\u2019s heart skipped a beat. At this time, even the stupidest person would be able to guess who it was.Jiang.Only, who was Jiang? A normal ghost definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to open the Hungry Ghost Path and keep his little pets here.However, the situation left no time for him to ponder. Under Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost\u2019s immense pressuring, Ghost Mother stood up once again. Her enormous body bathed in the moonlight; she released a deafening growl.Because of this, the mountains, forest, and soil all started shaking.As she growled, Yu Zhengdu could feel the dirt beneath his feat continuously tremble.The water in the black lake bubbled. Shortly after, hungry ghost after hungry ghost revealed their terrifying appearances from that muddy swamp.They were all barely clothed, dark, and skinny. Their skin was glued to their bodies, revealing the shapes of their bones. They reached out with their boney hands and crawled out of the swamp, moaning as they lunged at Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost.\u201cSo hungry, we\u2019re so hungry\u2014\u2014\u201d\u201cGive me food, I want to eat\u2014\u2014\u201d\u201cAll food turns into fire and ash, all water turns into lava\u2014\u2014\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so thirsty, so pained\u2014\u2014\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll never dare to again\u2014\u2014\u201dGhost Mother spread her arms. \u201cMy ghostly offspring, kill Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost\u2014\u2014\u201dThe hungry ghosts climbed onto Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost\u2019s giant figure. They resembled the hungry ghosts who wanted to climb out of h.e.l.l\u2019s doors as described in Buddhist scriptures. In that cold moonlight, they were a sea of bodies. Similar to the first time witnessing the appearances of all possible ghosts, this caused chills to run down one\u2019s body.However, Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost didn\u2019t seem frightened by this scene at all. He even released an overjoyed sound. \u201cNo wonder I couldn\u2019t find your ghostly offspring at all. So you hid them all here. Personally witness as I kill and eat all of your ghostly offspring. I\u2019m going to leave the Hungry Ghost Path today. Hahahahahaha\u2014\u2014\u201dTorch-Throated Hungry Ghost\u2019s sharp hands squeezed the ghosts who had crawled onto his face. He tossed them all away before sucking in and then releasing his stomach. With a \u201chong\u2014\u2014\u201d, a sea of fire erupted from his enormous, grotesque mouth.The fire pillar lit the forest up, illuminating the innumerous ghosts and traveling towards Yu Zhengdu.A sea of fire spread. Numerous ghostly offspring released wails and howls of despair in the flames.Yu Zhengdu was shocked. The flames had already reached him. At this time, a large black shadow covered him. Ghost Mother had stepped in front of him.\u201cNeedlepoint, hurry and run\u2014\u2014\u201dOnly now did Yu Zhengdu remember Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost, who was still holding onto his ankles. At such a critical moment, Ghost Mother had acted in the same manner as all other mothers \u2013 protecting her own child even though it put herself in danger.However, she very quickly got slapped away by Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost\u2019s large hand.Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost took big steps forward. He reached a hand out and grabbed Yu Zhengdu, then lifted him up.\u201cI\u2019ll give you the honor of being the 1000th ghost I\u2019ve eaten. The one who helps me leave the Hungry Ghost Path!\u201dYu Zhengdu floated in midair and watched as Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost opened his mouth as wide as possible, revealing his throat. That was a deep tunnel. Inside, flames that would never be put out flared. All food, ghosts, spirits, etc. would turn into ash after pa.s.sing through it.Yu Zhengdu thought . His forehead and palms started sweating.It couldn\u2019t be. Was he truly going to end here today?From afar, Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost\u2019s wailing sounded out. \u201cMom, hurry! Hurry and call more ghosts over and save Milk Tea Didi\u2014\u2014\u201dGhost Mother panted and cussed, \u201cThe other ghosts aren\u2019t my offspring. I don\u2019t know where they are right now. You think I can summon them whenever I want?\u201dTorch-Throated Hungry Ghost burst into laughter. \u201cSo what if they come? Right now, is there anyone else who\u2019s my match in the entirety of the Hungry Ghost Path?\u201dYu Zhengdu suddenly had an idea. Ghost Mother couldn\u2019t summon any more ghosts, but maybe he could.Previously, Shang Que had taught him his personal heart seal, the Ghost King of Luofeng Mountain\u2019s magical seal. He had once used that heart seal to summon a homebody ghost.Though it might be a bit difficult to completely turn the situation around, no matter what, he needed to at least try.As soon as he realized this, he hurriedly closed his eyes and, under the great stress from Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost, did his best to focus completely. He quietly read over the initiating incantation for Shang Que\u2019s magical seal.Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost\u2019s gaze returned from where it had been on Ghost Mother. He discovered that something was off and slightly narrowed his eyes. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dYu Zhengdu had already finished chanting the incantation. He wiped his sweat and had an expression that said . He answered, \u201cSummoning a ghost.\u201dWhether or not he would succeed was all up to destiny.Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost snorted once again after hearing this. \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear what I just said? Right now, in the Hungry Ghost Path, everything is my food\u2014\u2014\u201dGhost Mother heaved out a long sigh too. With a slurred, hopeless tone, she said, \u201cNo matter who you call right now, they\u2019d only help increase his power\u2026\u2026\u201dBefore she could finish speaking, large gusts of Underworld wind suddenly started blowing from all around. They whistled and roared, louder and stronger than any gust of wind before. In an instant, they caused Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost\u2019s flames to grow.Along with the wind came the rumble of thunder.All the ghosts instinctively leaned back to look up. They finally discovered that at an unknown time, the crescent moon in the sky had already been covered by layers of clouds. These dark clouds were like an ocean, vicious and absolute: they covered every inch of the sky. The dark, black sky and sea of flames on the ground created a striking contrast, increasing the tension.Needlepoint-Throated Hungry Ghost was so scared he once again covered his head and started trembling. \u201cAaah, what\u2019s this?\u201dGhost Mother stared at those thick clouds covering the sky, dazed. In complete disbelief, she looked at Yu Zhengdu. \u201cWho did you summon?\u201dYu Zhengdu\u2019s own expression was bewildered too. Even today, he still hadn\u2019t gotten a good grasp of the magical seal. He himself didn\u2019t know what he had summoned.With a \u201ckacha\u2014\u2014\u201d, a flash of lightning split open the gloomy clouds in the sky, separating the darkness into two halves.Innumerous bolts of thunder fire landed on the ground after this, their blazing flames painting the sky and ground red.In the flames, the newcomer revealed his original form.That was a ma.s.sive black shadow that connected the earth and the sky. One could faintly make out the shape of armor and a cape, billowing in the wind.Before him, Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost, who was actually as tall as the trees in the forest, suddenly seemed impossibly miniscule. He only barely reached the other\u2019s calves.Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost stared in disbelief at this horrifying figure. Fear and horror emerged in his eyes. \u201cW-who are you?\u201dThe black shadow slowly lowered its head. Something the shape of a crown could be barely discerned atop it.Only to see Ghost Mother\u2019s eyes widen more and more. Finally, she yelled in disbelief, \u201cG-G-Ghost King of Luofeng Mountain?\u201dUpon hearing this, Yu Zhengdu froze. He stared at the barely visible figure hidden behind the flames and asked, \u201cXiao Shang, is that you?\u201d\u201cIt is,\u201d Shang Que\u2019s voice gently rang out.A wild wind blew past, causing Torch-Throated Hungry Ghost to fall over.But Yu Zhengdu didn\u2019t fall down with him. Instead, he was gently picked up by a gust of Underworld wind and carefully placed on the ground.After he regained his balance, he finally realized that it hadn\u2019t been the wind that had picked him up, but a familiar figure.The thunder fires extinguished. The horrifying black shadow disappeared along with them, leaving only the person before him. That devastatingly beautiful face, forever well-kept suit, and frail appearance that he had never seen before.\u201cI finally found you.\u201d Shang Que\u2019s gaze was directly on him. Only around twelve hours after Yu Zhengdu\u2019s disappearance, he had already lost his usual calm.\u201cXiao Shang, how come you\u2019ve become so frail?\u201d Yu Zhengdu\u2019s expression tensed. Almost instinctively, he reached out and caressed Shang Que\u2019s face.Shang Que\u2019s heart finally managed to fall back down from his throat. Upon seeing Yu Zhengdu\u2019s reaction, he revealed a faint smile. \u201cI\u2019m fine, you don\u2019t need to worry\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHow could I not worry!\u201d Yu Zhengdu was in great pain. \u201cYour face is the most valuable thing in our company! It absolutely cannot collapse!\u201dShang Que: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d<b>The author has something to say:</b>Yu Zhengdu: The Heavens can collapse, the earth can collapse, but Boss\u2019s face cannot collapse!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It took a long time for him to regain his wits. He stiffly turned his head to look at Shang Que.Shang Que\u2019s expression was reserved. Upon noticing his gaze, he finally reluctantly waved his hand and said, \u201cI said I would consider it. You don\u2019t need to be so anxious.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe wasn\u2019t! He hadn\u2019t!After Shang Que finished speaking, he seemed to think that he had acted too arrogantly. He worried that this would negatively impact Yu Zhengdu\u2019s determination. Thus, he lowered his voice and carefully hinted, \u201c\u2026\u2026I believe that you have quite a high probability for success. No need to worry.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAs straight as he was, he could now tell that Shang Que was antic.i.p.ating this a lot!At a time like this, if he told Shang Que that he actually didn\u2019t have such intentions\u2026\u2026would he get thrown back into the Hungry Ghost Path forever?Yu Zhengdu very diligently pondered for a bit. He finally mustered up the courage \u2013 as a righteous, heteros.e.xual male, he shouldn\u2019t trick Boss into having feelings for him. Even under the threat of becoming a chicken, he still needed to tell the truth.He inhaled deeply and made to speak. At this time, Shang Que finally couldn\u2019t take it anymore. He pushed Yu Zhengdu. \u201cHurry and resurrect already. You need to be nice and healthy in order to confess to me.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201cBoss, hear me out\u2026\u2026\u201dUnfortunately, he ultimately didn\u2019t get to finish speaking because his spirit had already fallen back into his physical body.When the spirit left the body, it was like falling into an elaborate dream. During resurrection, everything experienced in the Underworld was just like a dream, disappearing in an instant.After Yu Zhengdu re-opened his eyes, he only felt like his brain was a pile of mush. His entire being felt muddled. It took a lot of time for him to come back to his senses.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d Yu Zhengdu slightly propped his head up and asked blearily.Shang Que sat down beside him and helped him up. He said, \u201cYour spirit got called away by Jiang. You took a trip to the Hungry Ghost Path.\u201d\u201cAh, right.\u201d Yu Zhengdu only barely remembered what had happened in the moment prior to losing consciousness. He angrily cussed Jiang out, then squeezed his own body. After confirming that he was as healthy as before, he finally heaved a sigh of relief. With furrowed brows, he asked, \u201cWhat happened in the Hungry Ghost Path again?\u201dShang Que very naturally half-cradled him, then patiently recounted the occurrences in the Hungry Ghost Path in detail.Those experiences seemed like shattered fragments of a dream to Yu Zhengdu. Originally, he had a faint and blurry recollection of everything. But after hearing someone speak of the details, he could finally piece everything together again to recover his memories.Following Shang Que\u2019s retelling, Yu Zhengdu slowly remembered most of everything that had happened while he had been a spirit.\u201cSo what is Jiang\u2019s true ident.i.ty?\u201d Yu Zhengdu\u2019s expression was solemn. \u201cHe has the power to open the Hungry Ghost Path and raise Heinous Ghosts in it. That\u2019s the setting a big boss would have.\u201d\u201cThere are very few people who have the ability to do those things, even less since the Heavens and earth collapsed.\u201d Shang Que lowered his gaze. \u201cI can approximately guess who he is.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201cWho?\u201dShang Que laughed softly, tone slightly mocking. \u201cAn old friend.\u201dYu Zhengdu fell silent for a moment. Suspiciously, he asked in response, \u201cOld friend?\u201dShang Que casually changed his description, \u201cOld ghost friend.\u201dYu Zhengdu finally nodded in satisfaction. \u201cWe\u2019re still quite careful.\u201dShang Que lowly said, \u201cIf it really is him, it won\u2019t be so easy to catch him.\u201dYu Zhengdu asked, worried, \u201cThen can you handle him?\u201dShang Que side-eyed Yu Zhengdu. \u201cWhy do you think he only dares to act behind my back instead of facing me head-on?\u201dYu Zhengdu fell silent for a moment. Very sensibly, he hugged Shang Que\u2019s arm and praised, \u201cHurrah for Boss.\u201dAfter being hugged by him, Shang Que\u2019s face slightly flushed red, but he didn\u2019t reject the touch. Instead, he used this opportunity to lean over a bit more, then gently embraced Yu Zhengdu quickly. \u201cThis time, he\u2019s suffered a great setback. He probably won\u2019t show himself again until much later. However, to be safe, it\u2019d be best if you didn\u2019t stray too far from me in the future.\u201dYu Zhengdu had originally acted in a bro-like manner, but after being wrapped in Shang Que\u2019s arms instead, he finally discovered that their posture seemed a bit overly intimate.Yu Zhengdu slightly furrowed his brows. The things his cla.s.s group chat had said appeared in his mind at this very opportune time. In addition to the fact that he vaguely remembered how strangely worried Shang Que had been in the Hungry Ghost Path, the warning bells went off very loudly in his heart.He thought about it before tentatively saying, \u201cBoss, you\u2019re honestly treating me too kindly. If not for the fact that you look so much like a straight man, I would suspect that you\u2019re interested in me!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never been in a relations.h.i.+p before, so don\u2019t know if I\u2019m straight or not.\u201d Shang Que thought about it, then comforted, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be so worried either. I believe I might not be super straight.\u201dYu Zhengdu: !!!!Shang Que noticed his shocked expression, so coughed softly. He very generously stated, \u201cAs for my feelings towards you\u2026\u2026If believing that makes you happier, then you can continue believing it.\u201dYu Zhengdu: ?????Yu Zhengdu gazed at Shang Que, perplexed. He wondered if he should ask the other to translate what he had just said?At this moment, Bai Zhinan and the Minan reincarnation point workers noticed the disturbance in this area. They walked in together. Upon seeing that Yu Zhengdu was awake, all of them exhaled in relief.Bai Zhinan wiped his forehead and said, \u201cYu ge, it\u2019s fantastic that you\u2019re fine.\u201dYu Zhengdu nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve worried you guys.\u201dBai Zhinan then asked Yu Zhengdu what had happened to him. Shang Que gave a brief summary of what had happened in the Hungry Ghost Path. Bai Zhinan sighed as he listened. He lamented, \u201cSince historical times, the Hungry Ghost Path has always been disregarded by the three realms. No one has ever paid attention to the beings in it. Who would\u2019ve thought that such a large incident would\u2019ve occurred.\u201dShang Que: \u201cThe world has changed is all.\u201dThough the Hungry Ghost Path had never been viewed with great importance, in the past eras, when numerous extremely capable masters lived, as soon as a blade of gra.s.s s.h.i.+fted in the Hungry Ghost Path, it would be detected fairly early on. It was only because currently, the Heavens and h.e.l.l had collapsed, leaving no energy remaining in the mortal realm, that evildoers could take advantage of this opportunity.Bai Zhinan revealed a worried expression. \u201cAccording to the meaning behind Ghost Mother\u2019s words, doesn\u2019t that mean that there are still several evil ghosts in the Hungry Ghost Path who have kept their memories? I fear that more Heinous Ghosts will appear in the future\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu waved his hands. \u201cWe\u2019re planning on reorganizing the Hungry Ghost Path. Later on, we\u2019ll enter the Hungry Ghost Path\u2019s data into the Life and Death Accounts system. The debugging system will automatically delete those viral memories.\u201dBecause of the magical borders with the mortal realm, previously, the Hungry Ghost Path had been like an exiled island: it hadn\u2019t been included in Luofeng\u2019s systems. After this encounter, Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que both realized that the borders could segregate humans and ghosts, but couldn\u2019t prevent true evil from entering.Bai Zhinan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe suddenly slightly sympathized with that Jiang. After working so hard and creating such an elaborate plan, expending who knows how much energy to raise those Heinous Ghosts, everything had been deleted by only a line of code from Yu Zhengdu.Who knew how angry Jiang would be after finding out about this.\u201cAlso, we\u2019re planning on building some basic structures and starting some cla.s.ses on morality in the Hungry Ghost Path,\u201d Yu Zhengdu continued.Bai Zhinan: \u201c\u2026\u2026Ah?\u201dHe had been a ghost for so many years, but this was his first time hearing anyone speak about educating the Hungry Ghost Path. His first reaction was to think that these hungry ghosts had all been great sinners in their past lives. Theoretically, they weren\u2019t worth it\u2026\u2026However, after hearing Yu Zhengdu\u2019s gourmet food plan, Bai Zhinan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHaving hungry ghosts attend lessons regarding gourmet food \u2013 was this even an ordinary education? This was purely a type of torture, right?But he had to admit that this was possibly the most suitable type of education for the Hungry Ghost Path.In the end, Bai Zhinan could only stutter out in agreement, \u201cThat is a good plan.\u201dYu Zhengdu lamented, \u201cAt the end of the day, we still need to pay more attention to those groups at the edges of civilization and guide them. Otherwise, it\u2019s very easy for them to become unstable factors.\u201dBai Zhinan: \u201c\u2026\u2026Right.\u201dShang Que then relayed some of his ideas and plans for the management of the Hungry Ghost Path in the future. At the end, he ordered, \u201cThe Hungry Ghost Path is primarily overlayed with Minan. The following events can be taken care of by you and the Ghost Mother of Xi Mountain.\u201dBai Zhinan used a notebook to write down all these important points. He nodded and said, \u201cGot it.\u201dAfter Shang Que finished sharing the work plans for the Hungry Ghost Path, Bai Zhinan said, \u201cYu ge just resurrected. If there\u2019s nothing else to do, I\u2019ll leave first. I don\u2019t want to disturb Yu ge\u2019s rest.\u201dShang Que nodded. Bai Zhinan made to leave, but Shang Que suddenly remembered something. He reached out with his hand and stopped the other. \u201cOh, right. Send a notification to all the company\u2019s employees for me too.\u201dBai Zhinan: \u201cWhat notification?\u201dShang Que named a date, then said, \u201cOn this day, every employee in the company gets a day off.\u201dBai Zhinan paused temporarily. The date Shang Que had given wasn\u2019t a holiday. He honestly couldn\u2019t tell why they were getting a day off. Additionally, that date was very far away from today\u2019s date. Even if he were giving everyone a holiday, he didn\u2019t need to notify them so early, right?Bai Zhinan was honestly confused. He couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cIs there something special about this day? Why do we get a holiday?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll become special when that day comes.\u201d Shang Que revealed a slightly pleased expression, then glanced at Bai Zhinan. \u201cOr is it that you guys don\u2019t want a holiday?\u201d\u201cWe do, we do,\u201d Bai Zhinan hurriedly replied. Who wouldn\u2019t want a free holiday? Though he didn\u2019t understand what Boss\u2019s 'special\u201d meant, he was extremely terrified that Shang Que would take back his words. Thus, he didn\u2019t dare to keep asking. \u201cI\u2019ll go send the notification right now.\u201dAfter Bai Zhinan exited the room, Shang Que was just about to tell Yu Zhengdu to rest some more when he turned around and was met with Yu Zhengdu\u2019s perplexed face.Yu Zhengdu was extremely confused. \u201cBoss, why are you suddenly giving everyone a day off?\u201dShang Que\u2019s gaze was distant. In an inadvertent manner, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not specially making time for you. I\u2019m just hoping that you\u2019ll be able to relax a bit and won\u2019t be so anxious.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cRest well.\u201d Shang Que pressed him down and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to go take care of the Hungry Ghost Path stuff. Let\u2019s eat together later.\u201dHe stood up, pondered a bit, then added, \u201cAlso, your cla.s.smate\u2019s wedding. I\u2019ll still attend with you as planned.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201cOh.\u201dAfter Shang Que left, Yu Zhengdu laid in the bed. The more he thought about it, the stranger things seemed. He kept feeling like something had happened while he had been a ghost? Otherwise, why would Shang Que keep implying certain things now that he had woken up?Yu Zhengdu thought for a long time but couldn\u2019t reach a conclusion. He tossed and turned in bed; in the end, he honestly couldn\u2019t fall asleep, so simply decided to take his phone out and scroll through his messages.Bai Zhinan had already sent out the holiday notification. Though there was still quite a bit of time before the day off, their company\u2019s group chat had already become filled with cheer.Kang Jin:\u3010What kind of G.o.dly boss is this?! Actually giving us a holiday outside of a federally mandated holiday?!\u3011Lu Lingxi:\u3010\u2026\u2026What are you saying? How could you say Boss is a G.o.d? He\u2019s the Ghost King!\u3011Kang Jin:\u3010What kind of ghostly boss is this? Doesn\u2019t sound like a compliment\u2026\u2026\u3011Zheng Yan:\u3010= = Everytime we see you ghosts chatting, us humans feel great mental pressure\u3011Zhao Ruola:\u3010Plus one\u3011Qu Guangzhao:\u3010Why are we getting a day off?!!! Aren\u2019t there enough federally mandated holidays as is?! Us ghosts don\u2019t need so much time off!\u3011Kang Jin:\u3010Overtime-lover hurry and shut your trap.\u3011Lu Lingxi:\u3010Exactly. All you need to do is celebrate!\u3011Coworker A:\u3010Throwing flowers.jpg\u3011Coworker B, C, D:\u3010Throwing flowers.jpg\u3011Yu Zhengdu didn\u2019t celebrate with the rest of the group. Instead, he stared at the vacation date Bai Zhinan had sent. Earlier, he hadn\u2019t paid much attention to it, but looking at it now, he finally discovered that this date was strangely familiar.He felt like he had seen it before somewhere. Also, it felt like it ought to be a very important date, but he honestly couldn\u2019t remember.At this moment, overtime-lover Qu Guangzhao spoke up again, unimpressed.Qu Guangzhao:\u3010So why is Boss randomly giving us a day off? Is there something special happening on that day?\u3011Bai Zhinan:\u3010Boss actually answered that question. He said that day will be special when we get to it. However, I don\u2019t know what he means by special\u3011Kang Jin:\u3010Haha, why does it sound like a wedding anniversary or something\u3011Coworker A:\u3010Right? If not for the fact that Boss is still single, I would vote for wedding anniversary too\u3011Shang Que:\u3010Heh heh\u3011As soon as Shang Que appeared, the group\u2019s wild reactions instantly calmed down. Everyone thought that Shang Que was unhappy with the wedding anniversary description, so were terrified that he would take back the vacation day because of this. They hurriedly switched the topic of the conversation. In only a moment, the atmosphere in the group chat was once again stupidly celebratory.Only Yu Zhengdu felt a sudden strike of lightning hit his heart.He remembered!No wonder he thought that date looked so familiar!Wasn\u2019t that the date that the Life Management app had said would be the date he and Shang Que confirmed their relations.h.i.+p?!!In a daze, Yu Zhengdu remembered what Shang Que had said before he had resurrected.Then, he looked at the \u201cheh heh\u201d Shang Que had sent in the group chat. This wasn\u2019t displeasure because of their coworkers\u2019 a.s.sumptions; this was clearly showing off\u2026\u2026Yu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dGreat. The holiday notification had already been delivered.He was extremely certain that at this time, if he dared to tell Shang Que that this was all only a misunderstanding\u2026\u2026 He didn\u2019t dare to think of the consequences.The next day, Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que attended Yu Zhengdu\u2019s cla.s.smate, Jia Yihua\u2019s, wedding reception together.Because he had remembered the prediction the Life Management app had given about his and Shang Que\u2019s relations.h.i.+p, in addition to the obvious antic.i.p.ation Shang Que was expressing, Yu Zhengdu was a bit out of it the entire wedding reception.Of course, that was only on the surface. In actuality, he was seriously stressing out in his mind.Should he tell Boss the truth or not?Yes? Right now, everyone at the company was celebrating the day off. Boss was such an arrogant person. How was he supposed to explain to the whole company that there actually wasn\u2019t anything special on that day?No? Yu Zhengdu felt like he was a sc.u.mbag who was lying to gain someone\u2019s affection.Sc.u.mbag Yu Zhengdu instinctively looked at Shang Que while blanking out. Shang Que was in the middle of eating something. Upon noticing Yu Zhengdu\u2019s gaze, he offhandedly peeled a shrimp and put it in the other\u2019s bowl. \u201cI remember that you like to eat this.\u201dYu Zhengdu stared with wide eyes at Shang Que who had so naturally peeled a shrimp for him. He instantly became even more bewildered.\u2026\u2026This wouldn\u2019t do. He felt a great sense of guilt in his heart. Yu Zhengdu\u2019s lips moved, \u201cBoss\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que: \u201c ?\u201dAfter Yu Zhengdu called out to him, though, he temporarily didn\u2019t know how to start this conversation. He started hesitating.At this moment, the auntie who had been observing them for a long time from the table beside theirs finally made a decision. She walked over and tapped Yu Zhengdu on the shoulder. \u201cYoung man, are you Yihua\u2019s friend?\u201dTheir conversation got interrupted by Auntie, but Yu Zhengdu inexplicably heaved out a sigh of relief because of this. He nodded at Auntie. \u201cYes, Auntie. What\u2019s wrong?\u201dAuntie asked with a smile, \u201cNothing, I just wanted to chat with you. Young man, do you have a significant other yet?\u201dYu Zhengdu reflexively shook his head. \u201cNot yet\u2026\u2026\u201dInstantly, Auntie\u2019s smile became extra bright. \u201cPerfect. My little sister has a daughter that just graduated this year. She\u2019s the same age as Yihua, good looking, and has a good job. Looks to me like you two are quite compatible\u2026\u2026\u201dBefore Auntie could finish speaking, Shang Que suddenly reached an arm out and tugged Yu Zhengdu close to himself. With a hostile gaze, he looked at Auntie before coldly saying, \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it. He\u2019s about to have a significant other!\u201dAuntie\u2019s face abruptly froze. For a moment, she couldn\u2019t think of a way to continue the conversation. After a short pause, she asked in embarra.s.sment, \u201cWhat does \u2018about to have a significant other\u2019 mean? What kind of significant other is that?\u201dShang Que slightly raised his chin. With a pleased expression, he stated, \u201cIt might be me.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d<b>The author has something to say:</b>Shang Que: I\u2019m still considering, but I think that his probability of success is going to be very high.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She stared at Shang Que for a long time before stuttering out, \u201cThis\u2026\u2026 What does \u2018it might be you\u2019 mean?\u201dShang Que slightly straightened his back and tugged at Yu Zhengdu\u2019s arm. His expression was proud. \u201cIn a few more weeks, he\u2019s planning to get together with me.\u201dAuntie: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAuntie looked at Shang Que in shock before turning to look at Yu Zhengdu again. her lips slightly trembled, \u201cAh, so you guys are\u2026\u2026are\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe wasn\u2019t!He was almost about to start three consecutive denials, but in public, he didn\u2019t dare to say anything that would directly embarra.s.s Shang Que. If he did, his cla.s.smate\u2019s wedding reception might suddenly end in disaster.Yu Zhengdu stressed out for a long time, finally swallowing all the words he had intended to say. He could only smile fakely at Auntie without saying anything.The opportunity for denial pa.s.sed in the blink of an eye. Auntie turned around and stumbled away.As soon as Auntie left, Shang Que gently patted the back of Yu Zhengdu\u2019s hand and lowly said, \u201cIf you encounter such occasions again in the future, just bravely say that you already have a significant other.\u201dYu Zhengdu stared at him with dead fish eyes, completely hopeless.Shang Que blinked and lamented, \u201cThough we haven\u2019t confirmed our relations.h.i.+p yet, under necessary conditions, I don\u2019t mind you using me as your s.h.i.+eld .\u201dYu Zhengdu\u2019s entire being felt weak. \u201c\u2026\u2026Thanks.\u201dThat night, Yu Zhengdu had just turned on his phone after landing in Fu City when he discovered that their cla.s.s group chat had exploded.Jia Yihua:\u3010Holy s.h.i.+t, Zhengdu and his boss really are a couple!!!\u3011Cla.s.smates:\u3010?????\u3011Zhang Qingqing:\u3010What\u2019s the situation? Hurry, relay in detail\u3011Jia Yihua:\u3010f.u.c.k, and Zhengdu kept pretending in this chat. He got outed on the spot at my wedding reception today!\u3011Zhu Yan:\u3010Outed on the spot? So exhilarating?\u3011Jia Yihua:\u3010So one of my aunties thought that Zhengdu was single and wanted to introduce her niece to him. Turns out Zhengdu\u2019s boss became so angry that he decided to give it all up for love and came out of the closet on the spot\u3011Jia Yihua:\u3010Scared my auntie so much! She told my mom before we even finished the wedding dinner!\u3011Zhang Qingqing:\u3010Holy f.u.c.k!!!\u3011Zhu Yan:\u3010Exciting! Shocked applause.jpg\u3011Cla.s.smate A:\u3010Yu Zhengdu, you dared to hide your romance. Come out to get beat up\u3011When Yu Zhengdu opened his cla.s.s group chat, his cla.s.smates had already sent 999+ messages discussing his love story with Shang Que.Yu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu didn\u2019t dare to make his presence known in the group chat at this time. He could only heave out a long sigh and turn around to look at Shang Que, who was next to him. Only to see Shang Que very naturally grab his luggage and smile at him. \u201cI\u2019ll get it for you.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe really wanted to ask,Yu Zhengdu facepalmed. He once again felt a strong urge to tell Boss the truth. But as soon as he felt this urge, he saw Shang Que lift his gaze up from his phone screen and furrow his brows. \u201cYour school\u2019s forum is truly so gossipy. Our situation has been uploaded so quickly!\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201dHe hurriedly used his phone to check their school forum. Well. Probably some blabbermouth in his cla.s.s had revealed the contents of their group chat. This wasn\u2019t strange, though. In the past, a lot of people had asked his cla.s.smates about his relations.h.i.+p status. Only, these other people wouldn\u2019t think of him like his cla.s.smates would. They immediately posted this news onto the forum.Because of his popularity, that post became a \u201chot post\u201d very quickly. The comments were full of little s.h.i.+meis crying and wailing.Yu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAlright. Right now, his rumored relations.h.i.+p with Shang Que had technically been confirmed.Yu Zhengdu refreshed the post again. In the comments, aside from the people who were shocked that the ten thousand year single dog who had been single since the womb would actually start dating, others were confused by his s.e.xual orientation. After all, all of Yu Zhengdu\u2019s rumored partners at school had been girls. Though none of them had ended up working out, because of this, it was reasonable to a.s.sume that Yu Zhengdu was probably as straight as an arrow.After reading these confused comments, Yu Zhengdu couldn\u2019t help thinking of what Shang Que had said previously. He had never been in a relations.h.i.+p before \u2013 who knew if he was straight or not?There was also an ID, that temporarily couldn\u2019t be determined to be a fan or antifan, that swore in the post that this was fake news. The reason was because Yu Zhengdu had previously rejected a certain school flower . Shang Que wasn\u2019t even on par with the school flower. How could Yu Zhengdu be dating him?There were actually people agreeing with this comment.Yu Zhengdu\u2019s entire being felt very \u201cemmmm.\u201d He couldn\u2019t help but say: though Shang Que was very silly, to be completely fair, he wasn\u2019t not on par with anyone!Back and forth, the post argued uselessly. Yu Zhengdu himself didn\u2019t find this a big deal. After flipping through a few pages of comments, he closed the post. But Shang Que seemed to not feel the same way. He read the entire post from start to finish, following which his expression darkened. Tone slightly displeased, he asked, \u201cWhy is this person telling everyone that you pursued me?\u201dYu Zhengdu glanced at the ID Shang Que was talking about and said, \u201cOh.\u201d He explained, \u201cThis guy is in my year, but was in the law school. Apparently his girlfriend used to like me?\u201dThis ID had started frequently criticizing Yu Zhengdu during the first year of university. It was a common name, especially under Yu Zhengdu\u2019s various CP posts. Normally, it posted posts that mocked Yu Zhengdu for selling his face and other similar topics. Later on, Yu Zhengdu had been bored during cla.s.s one day and offhandedly checked this person\u2019s IP through his posts. Only then did he discover that the other was a student at the law school.Even so, Yu Zhengdu had always been someone who was too lazy to spend his time on such meaningless matters. He had never even looked at the other. Also, Yu Zhengdu had been obsessed with technical skill during university, somehow managing to remain single for all four years. Everyone knew that this ID was a long-time Yu Zhengdu antifan as well. Normally, everybody ignored him.It was unexpected that someone had finally confirmed Yu Zhengdu\u2019s relations.h.i.+p status. Additionally, his significant other was his company\u2019s boss. That person had dirt on him at long last. He took this opportunity to start spreading a strange tale of how Yu Zhengdu had disregarded his morals to shamelessly stick to his boss in order to get promoted.However, the students of Fu City University weren\u2019t idiots either. Everyone could bear witness to Yu Zhengdu\u2019s prowess. Previously, he had also gotten on the trending topics list with Jiao Shanlan and Zhao Ruola. Additionally, that ID was from a long-time antifan. Because of this, not many people paid attention to him.Yu Zhengdu didn\u2019t consider it a big deal either. \u201cJust ignore him.\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Shang Que hrmph\u2019d. \u201cHe\u2019s annoying.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHowever, he did feel a bit mystified. Though this antifan\u2019s actions were quite annoying, wasn\u2019t this made-up account of him pursuing Shang Que the exact story Shang Que had envisioned in his head?Technically speaking, Shang Que should be extremely pleased. Why was he suddenly angry?While furiously typing away at his phone, Shang Que said, \u201cThe two of us are\u2026\u2026hrmph. Who does that monster think he is to be criticizing us?!\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Though Boss had automatically silenced himself, this line was honestly too popular. He could automatically fill in the blanks.\u2014\u2014The two of us are a talented and handsome couple. Who does that monster think he is to be criticizing us?It had to be said that Boss had truly learned too many phrases online that he shouldn\u2019t have learned.Yu Zhengdu weakly ma.s.saged his temples. \u201cBoss, you don\u2019t need to listen to a monster\u2019s words\u2026\u2026\u201dOnly to see Shang Que tap his phone one final time. He looked up and said with satisfaction, \u201cDone.\u201dThe alarm bells started ringing in Yu Zhengdu\u2019s head. He instantly felt an impending sense of doom, so hurriedly asked, \u201cWhat did you do?\u201dShang Que waved his phone. \u201cI registered for an account and replied to that monster.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen he reopened the post to check, the post had gotten b.u.mped up to the top again, as expected. A newly registered ID, \u201cFrom Today On I Will Be A European G.o.d,\u201d replied to the antifan: Bulls.h.i.+t. I\u2019m Zhengdu\u2019s boss. I\u2019m the one pursuing him!Yu Zhengdu became momentarily shocked out of his mind, but not because Shang Que had specially made an account to argue with someone. For Shang Que, this could only be considered normal behavior. It wasn\u2019t enough to elicit a reaction from Yu Zhengdu.The true reason Yu Zhengdu was surprised was because of the contents of Shang Que\u2019s reply. He froze for a moment before asking, \u201cBoss, why did you reply to him like that?\u201dShang Que hummed. \u201cWhat happens between us is solely between us. However, to the rest of the world, we should still say I\u2019m pursuing you.\u201dHe scanned Yu Zhengdu out of his periphery and added, \u201cEven if I don\u2019t agree later on, I won\u2019t let you become a subject of ridicule.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dTo be honest, he had felt quite touched by the first half of Shang Que\u2019s response. Shang Que was someone who couldn\u2019t bear being shamed at all; he even needed to win every argument online. At such a time, he unexpectedly managed to consider Yu Zhengdu\u2019s perspective.Though the people on the forum would probably only think that this was a fake account created to pretend to be Shang Que, consequently not taking his words seriously, Yu Zhengdu knew that Shang Que\u2019s reply was from the bottom of his heart.Only, after hearing the second half of Shang Que\u2019s response, Yu Zhengdu became weak once more.Based on Shang Que\u2019s extremely diligent att.i.tude, he was currently very, very suspicious if he would have the opportunity to wait for Shang Que to \u201cnot agree.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026Thanks.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Shang Que waved his hands, then pulled back his phone and continued typing away. \u201cThis monster actually dared to reply to me. I\u2019m determined to cuss him out until he deletes his account.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe watched as the rumors spread faster and faster. Yu Zhengdu thought about it the whole night and believed that he definitely needed to make things clear.Only, every time he thought of how Boss had looked while bragging, he surprisingly didn\u2019t feel angry. Instead, he felt\u2026\u2026reluctant.Ey, this time, he really was going to be a sc.u.mbag.The next day, Yu Zhengdu received a warm welcome from his coworkers after he returned to work at the company. This business trip, he had visited several cities. It had already been over half a month since he had been at the company. His coworkers missed him quite a lot.Especially Kang Jin, Lu Lingxi, and the other ones who had a good relations.h.i.+p with him. As soon as they saw him walk in, they urgently dragged him into a conference room.\u201cXiao Yu, you\u2019ve worked hard this business trip.\u201d Lu Lingxi poured a cup of water for him.Yu Zhengdu: \u201cIt was alright. Just doing my job.\u201d\u201cNot even. Didn\u2019t you also get turned into a spirit to take a trip to the Hungry Ghost Path? Too dangerous.\u201d Kang Jin walked over to help ma.s.sage his shoulders. \u201cHow fortunate that there was only danger, but no actual harm. Otherwise, we truly wouldn\u2019t know what to do.\u201dThough they were telling the truth, their behavior seemed a bit too fawning and attentive. Yu Zhengdu very quickly noticed that something was wrong. He fell silent for a moment before asking, \u201cIs there something you guys want to tell me?\u201dKang Jin stopped talking and looked at Lu Lingxi. Lu Lingxi looked back at Kang Jin. The two of them stared at each other.Yu Zhengdu: ??A while later, Kang Jin became the first to muster up the courage to hand a small box over to Yu Zhengdu. He said, \u201cThis is the situation: we\u2019ve specially prepared a gift for you now that you\u2019re back.\u201d\u201cIs there such a need\u2026\u2026\u201d Yu Zhengdu was momentarily speechless. He accepted the box and said while opening it, \u201cWhat a trivial matter. I thought someone was stealing eggs \u2026\u2026\u201dWhen he opened the box, there was an egg laying in it.Yu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe box was very intricate. There was also a thick layer of cotton at the bottom of it. Atop the cotton, a pure white egg quietly rested. The egg was quite large, about two or three times the size of a regular chicken egg.Yu Zhengdu temporarily couldn\u2019t determine if such a gift was thoughtful or not.If you said it wasn\u2019t thoughtful, this box and design were so intricate. The size of the egg was also extraordinary.If you said it was thoughtful, though\u2026\u2026 This was only an egg.Yu Zhengdu was silent for a long time. Finally, he calmly put the box away and solemnly stated, \u201cThank you, I like it very much.\u201dKang Jin heaved out a long sigh of relief. \u201cAs long as you like it.\u201dLu Lingxi hesitated for a moment, then added, \u201cSo do you need us to take care of the stuff after?\u201dYu Zhengdu thought about it before nodding. \u201cSure. Then I\u2019ll have to trouble you to make it into a salted egg for me, please.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Upon hearing this, Kang Jin became extremely panicked. \u201cYou can\u2019t!\u201dYu Zhengdu was bewildered, only to hear Kang Jin stutter out, \u201cXiao Yu, this, this is Peppa .\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c????\u201d<b>The author has something to say:</b>Peppa: Ga !Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 78": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/New Times, New HellChapter 79 - Peppa GoosePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 79 - Peppa GooseIt turned out that after the Life and Death Accounts backend system and Life Management app became released, Peppa\u2019s reincarnation results rapidly became fixed too. Originally, everyone had been planning to hold a farewell party for her after her reincarnation results came out. Then, they would personally send her to reincarnate.Unfortunately, when Peppa\u2019s reincarnation results came out, Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que had been in the middle of their Minan business trip. More unfortunately, Peppa happened to be playing next to the Ancient Well Reincarnation Point.There were many friendly ghosts that knew Peppa at the reincarnation point. Everyone helped Peppa use her tablet to download the app and check \u2013 with this, they found out that it happened to be her scheduled reincarnation day that day. The time for reincarnation couldn\u2019t be delayed, otherwise, the reincarnation results later would only get worse and worse. Peppa\u2019s original reincarnation result already hadn\u2019t been great. If she delayed her reincarnation, the consequences would be unimaginable.Thus, due to the urging of several friendly ghosts, Peppa could only give Kang Jin a quick call before being rushed by everyone to reincarnate.At first, Kang Jin had wanted to discuss with Yu Zhengdu, but that day, Yu Zhengdu had coincidentally been stuck in the Hungry Ghost Path. He couldn\u2019t be contacted. Additionally, Kang Jin didn\u2019t dare to let Peppa switch times. He could only listen to the system\u2019s notifications and quickly pick up Peppa in her reincarnated form after everything.\u201cThis\u2026\u2026is Peppa.\u201d Kang Jin carefully picked up the box with the egg in it and gently set it on the table.\u201cHow\u2026\u2026how could this happen\u2026\u2026\u201d Yu Zhengdu stared at that fist-sized egg. Temporarily, his emotions became a mess. Though he had already prepared himself ahead of time, knowing for certain that Peppa wouldn\u2019t be able to reincarnate as a human, he had always thought that Peppa ought to reincarnate as a pig, dog, or something else similar. He hadn\u2019t expected at all that she would ultimately become an egg.A moment later, Yu Zhengdu inhaled deeply. He asked the most important question, \u201cSo shouldn\u2019t we be coming up with a plan to hatch Peppa?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ve already prepared everything.\u201d As Lu Lingxi spoke, she walked outside and carried a cage back in.Yu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIn the cage, a fat, white duck was in the middle of flapping its wings. It quacked nonstop.Yu Zhengdu reached a realization. \u201cSo Peppa reincarnated as a duck?\u201dAfter brief thought, he realized this was logical. Just now, he had been brainwashed by the company\u2019s chicken warnings, so had a.s.sumed that this was an irregularly large chicken egg. Thinking about it now, it was more logical for an egg this size to be the egg of a different species.\u201cNo, a goose.\u201d Kang Jin wiped his face and stated in embarra.s.sment, \u201cOriginally, we wanted to catch the goose mother and bring it back to hatch the egg, but\u2026\u2026geese are too vicious. We couldn\u2019t win the fight, so could only go to the market and buy a female duck instead.\u201dLu Lingxi scoffed. \u201cNot even.\u201d She continued to mock, \u201cBecause he was stealing the egg, Kang Jin\u2019s spirit almost became paralyzed because of how hard the goose pecked him.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you guys just buy an incubator?\u201dKang Jin, Lu Lingxi: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dKang Jin asked, shocked, \u201cSuch things exist?\u201dAs they spoke, they saw the door to the conference room get pushed open. Shang Que walked in and glanced at Yu Zhengdu. He said, \u201cHow come you didn\u2019t go to my office after arriving? I brought you breakfast.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe textbook boyfriend had appeared again.Before he could say anything, Kang Jin spoke up first. With an exaggerated expression, he praised, \u201cOur Boss is too amazing! He even brought breakfast for his employee!\u201dHe rubbed his hands together and looked at Shang Que expectantly. \u201cSo do we get some too?\u201dShang Que side-eyed him. \u201cWho are you to me? To dare to want breakfast?\u201d\u201cYour employee.\u201d Kang Jin glanced at Yu Zhengdu. \u201cThe same as him.\u201dShang Que scoffed. \u201cYou\u2019re the same as him?\u201dKang Jin shuddered out of the blue, but he still felt very confused. \u201cAm I not?\u201dBoth employees, both male\u2026\u2026Yu Zhengdu felt that if they continued this conversation, Shang Que would probably be able to confirm the rumors to the rest of the company too. He hurriedly said, \u201cOf course not. You\u2019re bald.\u201dKang Jin: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que glanced at Yu Zhengdu, giving him a gaze that read \u201crelax, I\u2019ll keep the secret.\u201d He nodded in agreement. \u201cExactly. You\u2019re bald.\u201dYu Zhengdu facepalmed. However, there was something more important at the moment. Thus, he couldn\u2019t be bothered worrying about anything else for now. He hurriedly picked up the egg from the desk and held it out in front of Shang Que. As soon as he was about to speak, he saw Shang Que furrow his brows and ask, \u201cPeppa?\u201dYu Zhengdu was shocked. He looked closely at the egg, expression admiring. \u201cYou can recognize her even in this state?\u201dShang Que was silent for a moment. \u201cThe aura around the egg is the same as Peppa\u2019s.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201cOh.\u201dHe sighed, expression very regretful. \u201cI originally thought that Peppa would reincarnate as a baby pig. Who knew that she actually turned into Peppa Goose.\u201dShang Que didn\u2019t have much of a reaction, though. The Six Paths of Reincarnation were nothing special in his eyes. The human path was fine, the beast path was too: both were for a lifetime. To him, being a goose or pig weren\u2019t so different from each other.He thought about it and said, \u201cBeing a goose is nice too. It\u2019ll be easier for us to raise her. If she had reincarnated into a pig, we would\u2019ve had to build a pigsty for her.\u201dAfter hearing this, Yu Zhengdu agreed as well. It was hard raising a pig in the city. Additionally, if she happened to grow too big, it would truly be quite troublesome taking care of her.As such, Peppa\u2019s transformation into a goose wasn\u2019t so hard to accept anymore. Yu Zhengdu very quickly accepted this new reality and garnered up the energy once again to roll up his sleeves and say, \u201cSo, next up, we need to first get Peppa to hatch.\u201d\u201cHave the wet nurse duck do it.\u201d Kang Jin opened the white duck\u2019s cage. Just as he was about to reach a hand in to pick it up, the duck quacked loudly and took the opportunity to viciously peck Kang Jin. It had been stuck in the cage for too long. It flapped its wings and shot out, making \u201c guaguaguagua \u201d noises as it wildly flew around the office.Yu Zhengdu sighed, \u201cHow unexpected. Not only did you lose to a goose, but even a duck can bully you.\u201dKang Jin with a pained expression: \u201cXiao Yu, you absolutely have to help me keep this a secret. I can\u2019t have anyone else at the company finding out that I\u2019m not even a match for a duck\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201d Yu Zhengdu compa.s.sionately patted him on the shoulder. He pointed his chin at the duck. \u201cCatch the duck and bring it back first.\u201dShortly thereafter, the tiny office became Kang Jin and the big white duck\u2019s stage. A duck and a ghost; one ran and the other chased. That duck was extremely strong and nimble, completely capable of flying high and also running low to the ground. In only a moment, the entire room was filled with floating white duck feathers.Kang Jin honestly couldn\u2019t catch that duck. He could only screech in threat, \u201cDuck, if you\u2019re smart, hurry and get over here yourself. Only then will I ensure that you can live out the rest of your life in peace. However, if you continue running, believe me when I say I\u2019ll turn you into duck soup tonight!\u201dThe big white duck flapped its wings and turned so that its b.u.t.t was facing Kang Jin: \u201cga\u2014\u2014\u201d.Yu Zhengdu stuck his hands out regretfully. \u201cSeems like you\u2019ve failed to reach an agreement.\u201dKang Jin was incredibly ashamed. He could only say in embarra.s.sment, \u201cThis duck has such poor awareness. Who knows if it\u2019ll mess up hatching Peppa. We\u2019d better just switch to an incubator.\u201dYu Zhengdu felt disdainful of his intelligence. \u201cWould you even know how to use an incubator if we switched to it?\u201dKang Jin: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHowever, Yu Zhengdu was a bit troubled too. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any experience hatching eggs. What will happen if we switch to an incubator but mess up?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need to switch,\u201d Shang Que suddenly spoke. He gazed at the duck who was staring down at them from the top of the cabinet it had jumped onto. \u201cThis one is in pretty good health, perfect for hatching Peppa.\u201dKang Jin said in embarra.s.sment, \u201cIt is in good health, but it isn\u2019t obedient\u2026\u2026\u201dAs soon as he finished speaking, Shang Que lifted his chin at the duck. He said, \u201cGet down here.\u201dOnly to see the originally bold and arrogant duck tuck its wings in and agilely jump down. It cautiously waddled towards Shang Que with its webbed feet, then shrunk its head back and gently released a \u201cga\u2014\u2014\u201d.Everyone: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que nodded. He glanced at the box on the desk that was holding Peppa\u2019s egg and asked the duck, \u201cKnow how to hatch eggs?\u201dThe duck took two tiny steps back, then suddenly stretched out its wings. It lunged forward and directly flew onto the desk before quickly sitting atop the box. It didn\u2019t even find the spot uncomfortable; the duck scooted its head closer to Shang Que ingratiatingly. \u201cGa\u2014\u2014\u201dYu Zhengdu was honestly astounded. \u201cBoss, I hadn\u2019t expected that you would be an expert duck trainer!\u201dShang Que: \u201c\u2026\u2026I only scared it a bit.\u201dHe pointed at Yu Zhengdu and told the duck, \u201cFrom now on, you need to listen to him too.\u201dThe duck instantly straightened out its neck and nudged its head toward Yu Zhengdu. \u201cGa\u2014\u2014\u201dYu Zhengdu reached a hand out and rubbed its round head. \u201cGood duck, good duck.\u201dKang Jin became greatly excited after seeing this. He hurriedly reached a hand out to try and pat the duck\u2019s head too. \u201cAnd me and me.\u201dShang Que calmly glanced at him. \u201cYou can ignore him.\u201dCoincidentally, Kang Jin\u2019s hand had just reached the duck\u2019s head. The duck released a loud \u201cga\u2014\u2014\u201d and forcefully pecked his palm.Kang Jin howled and s.n.a.t.c.hed his hand back, cradling it to his chest. With tears in his eyes, he looked at Shang Que. \u201cBoss, why do you treat me so?\u201dShang Que\u2019s gaze fell onto Yu Zhengdu. \u201cYou and him\u2026\u2026are different.\u201dKang Jin: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dBecause Peppa had suddenly turned into a goose, they spent the whole morning in a mess. After finally getting the big white duck under control and getting it to agree to hatch the egg, Shang Que picked up the egg with one hand and Yu Zhengdu\u2019s hand with the other. He said, \u201cLet\u2019s go eat breakfast in my office.\u201dYu Zhengdu pulled his hand out of Shang Que\u2019s grasp. \u201cBoss, I have something to tell you.\u201dShang Que didn\u2019t pay much attention to this. He turned around and glanced back at the duck. \u201cKeep up.\u201dThus, the duck instantly stood up straight. While shaking its b.u.t.t, it waddled behind them into Shang Que\u2019s office.As expected, Shang Que\u2019s office was filled with the sumptuous breakfast he had prepared for Yu Zhengdu. As soon as he walked in the door, Shang Que pushed the breakfast in front of Yu Zhengdu. \u201cYou eat first. I\u2019ll find a spot for Peppa.\u201dHe walked in a circle around the office. Finally, after some thought, he emptied out the area under the desk. While organizing, he said, \u201cLet\u2019s just hatch her here. This way, you can often come visit. I\u2019ll tell Kang Jin to buy a suitable nest later\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu stared at the breakfast on the table. In total, there were four boxes, all filled with his favorite foods. Only now did he realize that Shang Que had seemingly always been very attentive towards him.There was an indescribable feeling in Yu Zhengdu\u2019s heart. He watched Shang Que\u2019s busy figure for awhile before finally calling out, \u201cBoss\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Shang Que poked his head out from under the office desk. He rested his chin on the desk and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201cWe can figure out Peppa\u2019s situation later. Sit first\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I can sit later too. Peppa\u2019s more important.\u201d Shang Que caressed the goose egg and seriously stated, \u201cWe won\u2019t have children in the future. Peppa\u2019s basically our kid. We can\u2019t be careless at all\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026??\u201d<b>The author has something to say:</b>Shang Que: We\u2019re a happy and complete family!Yu Zhengdu: Wait a minute.

For a moment, he forgot to respond.Shang Que started fantasizing again, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. When Peppa hatches, I\u2019ll give her a human consciousness so that she can become the most intelligent female goose in the world.\u201dA daughter had already appeared\u2026\u2026Yu Zhengdu didn\u2019t know if he had lost the ability to reason from shock. But surprisingly, he still managed to retort at this time, \u201cThen does that mean she\u2019ll be able to attend the high school exams?\u201dShang Que very seriously answered, \u201cAfter gaining a consciousness, there definitely won\u2019t be any problems with her intelligence. However, it\u2019d still be a bit difficult to attend the high school exams\u2026\u2026\u201dNo s.h.i.+t. Of course it would be difficult. A goose wouldn\u2019t even be able to get a household registration booklet : a preschool wouldn\u2019t let her in their doors, not to mention the high school exams.Only to hear Shang Que continue, \u201cMainly because she wouldn\u2019t be able to hold a pen with her webbed feet, meaning she wouldn\u2019t be able to answer the problems.\u201dYu Zhengdu expressionlessly said, \u201cWhat a true pity. Otherwise, Peppa might become the first rocket scientist goose.\u201dShang Que glanced at him. \u201cIf you really want to train her to become a rocket scientist, that isn\u2019t completely impossible. I\u2019ll come up with a plan for you\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu hurriedly waved his hands.\u201cNo no no, I was just kidding.\u201dHe didn\u2019t want to see Shang Que forcing a goose to learn algebra at the company in the future. He would be able to accept this development, but they still needed to consider the mental health of their other employees.Shang Que finally decided on a place to hatch the egg. That big white duck was very sensible. She knew that the spot was for her, so without even daring to quack, obediently walked over and squatted down. After Kang Jin returned with the newly bought nest, she would be able to start hatching the egg.Everything was properly prepared. Shang Que sat back in his chair, satisfied. Upon noticing that Yu Zhengdu still hadn\u2019t eaten his breakfast, he couldn\u2019t help furrowing his brows. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you eating?\u201dYu Zhengdu came back to his senses. \u201cI have something to tell you.\u201dShang Que: \u201cEat breakfast first. Otherwise, you\u2019ll be hungry.\u201dYu Zhengdu\u2019s lips moved. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll eat it right now.\u201d\u201cWait a minute. I think it\u2019s gone cold.\u201d Shang Que felt the box holding the breakfast. He stood up again. \u201cI\u2019ll heat it up for you in the microwave first.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dBy now, he already couldn\u2019t reject the other\u2019s offer. Powerlessly, he leaned back. \u201c .\u201dAfter heating up the breakfast and returning, Shang Que watched Yu Zhengdu finish eating before finally asking, \u201cWhat did you want to tell me just now?\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dEy, he had eaten the breakfast Boss had personally heated up. Additionally, he had watched Boss fantasize about raising a daughter all morning. He couldn\u2019t really bring himself to tell Boss the truth at this time.However, short pain was preferable to long pain. It wasn\u2019t like he could wait until the child actually got older before making himself clear\u2026\u2026ah pei . He had been brainwashed, all because of those strange things Shang Que had said. There was to be no waiting until the kid got older!Yu Zhengdu made a conflicted expression in his heart. Yet, he still hesitantly started, \u201cRegarding the relations.h.i.+p between you and me, I want to say\u2026\u2026\u201dHe finally opened his mouth with great difficulty, but froze up again.Shang Que stared at him for a long time because he didn\u2019t continue his sentence. He couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cWhat do you want to say?\u201dYu Zhengdu looked up at him. His gaze was a bit bewildered. Only now did he discover that he hadn\u2019t come up with an eloquent statement yet.Directly telling Boss ? This wasn\u2019t suitable or addressing the actual problem.Say ? But he instinctively was slightly unwilling to say this.Momentarily, he couldn\u2019t organize his thoughts. But the arrow was already notched onto the bow. He pondered a bit and decided to start with the culprit of this entire situation, the strange prophecy given by the app. He said, \u201cI feel like our app\u2019s big data fortune telling might not be accurate all the time\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que unconsciously nodded. \u201cNaturally. Human prophecies and big data prophecies both encounter the problem of probability.\u201dYu Zhengdu hummed in implication. He furiously signalled to Shang Que through his gaze, \u201cSok2026;k2026;\u201dShang Que: \u201cSo what?\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201ck2026;k2026;\u201dAs expected, during such critical moments, he and Boss had zero synchronization when it came to communicating through eye contact.He sighed softly to himself. Just as he was about to go all out, the sound of knocking drifted in from outside the door. Lu Lingxi pushed the door open and glanced at them before saying, \u201cBoss, Xiao Yu, Qin Yuejian brought someone from his company here. He says they want to sign our company\u2019s band.\u201dQin Yuejian was an extremely popular male celebrity right now. He had many fans. Previously, Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que had gotten to know him because of the \u201cPalpitating Youth\u201d event. They had accidentally helped his deceased high school cla.s.smate, Zhan Keji, erase his obsession, freeing Zhen Keji from where he had been trapped in their high school cla.s.sroom.Currently, Qin Yuejian was already Luofeng\u2019s VIP customer. Not only had he purchased the entire set of Luofeng\u2019s products, he had also upgraded his Underworld communication service to the annual package. This way, he could maintain punctual communication with Zhan Keji.However, Lu Lingxi\u2019s words caused Yu Zhengdu to be extremely perplexed. He asked, \u201cWhat band? Since when did our company have a band?\u201dLu Lingxi was silent for a moment before saying, \u201cThe kinnaras.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu only found out the details of the situation after asking for them.It turned out that this was all because he and Shang Que had previously exposed a cult master, the monk Jue Yin, in Diyang, where he had been scamming the elderly by pretending to be the head disciple of the \u201cGreat Kinnara King.\u201d Consequently, they had subdued two Western music G.o.ds \u2013 kinnaras \u2013 who had escaped to the mortal realm prior to the end of the Heavens.Because those faithful elders who had been scammed hoped that they could continue listening to the kinnaras\u2019 Sanskrit, Yu Zhengdu agreed to send them an audio recording later.But Luofeng didn\u2019t have any professional audio recording equipment. Coincidentally, Qin Yuejian\u2019s management company had started off as a record label. Thus, Yu Zhengdu rented their recording studio for two days through this connection. He made the kinnaras record a few songs and sent them to those elderly individuals.Yu Zhengdu\u2019s intention was to help those elders fulfill their wishes. Additionally, work at Luofeng was too busy, meaning that he didn\u2019t pay attention to anything else after he sent the music.Yet unexpectedly, those songs mysteriously went viral on the Internet.In the beginning, the Sanskrit was only popular among the elderly. Many old people believed that only people of their age would like this type of music. They only shared these songs with each other, until later on, some of these elders\u2019 children unintentionally heard them and became astounded. These children turned around and uploaded the songs online.Kinnaras\u2019 Sanskrit was extremely unique. It was a music style that had never appeared in the current music industry. It was clearly very Buddhist, but also strangely pleasing and touching, almost as if it could directly burrow into the depths of one\u2019s heart.It could be said that there hadn\u2019t been a single person who hadn\u2019t felt touched after hearing the kinnaras\u2019 Sanskrit.The Sanskrit had gone completely viral online. Even under the circ.u.mstances where n.o.body knew who the performers were, the songs had already gained a large population of fans.\u201cRight now, all the famous short video editors\u2019 go-to background songs are the kinnaras\u2019 songs,\u201d Lu Lingxi said with a grimace. \u201cApparently, when a few gaming streamers used the kinnaras\u2019 music as the background music during their livestreams, they became extremely polite while gaming. This surprised their fans a lot.\u201dYu Zhengdu was very surprised too. \u201cIt has such an effect? Polite in what way?\u201dLu Lingxi: \u201cApparently, when they cuss, they use \u2018 your mom\u2019 instead of \u2018your mom\u2019\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026That\u2019s considered polite?\u201dShang Que was obviously more qualified to comment on the environment in games. Upon hearing this, he nodded. \u201cIn games, yes.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe surprising popularity of the kinnaras\u2019 music aroused the attention of many management companies. Only, the other companies were still in the middle of investigating this mysterious band\u2019s background while Qin Yuejian\u2019s company was one step ahead of everyone else because they had previously rented the recording studio to Yu Zhengdu.Yu Zhengdu thought about it. He looked towards Shang Que. \u201cShould we go have a discussion?\u201dShang Que waved his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s not that important. You can go by yourself.\u201dYu Zhengdu wasn\u2019t surprised. For some unknown reason, Shang Que had always seemed to dislike these two little music G.o.ds. Thus, he nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201dJust as he was about to stand up, Shang Que suddenly said, \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ve finished saying what you wanted to tell me?\u201dYu Zhengdu paused for a second. He obviously couldn\u2019t clearly speak his mind in only a few sentences. Qin Yuejian was still waiting. He pondered a bit and said, \u201cWait a moment. I\u2019ll tell you after I get back.\u201dShang Que felt that this wasn\u2019t a big deal. \u201cOkay.\u201dAfter, he suddenly revealed a mysterious smile, then turned on his computer screen. \u201cThen let me first find some dresses for Peppa that are suitable for geese to wear\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu didn\u2019t directly head to see Qin Yuejian and the person from his company. Instead, he sought out the kinnaras first and explained the current situation to them.After all, according to how quickly the kinnaras were gaining popularity, even if they failed to reach an agreement with Qin Yuejian\u2019s company, there would definitely be other management companies seeking them out. In other words, whether or not they wanted to sign a contract and debut was currently reliant on their att.i.tudes, not the company\u2019s att.i.tude.After hearing what Yu Zhengdu said, the two kinnaras were also extremely surprised.It had been almost a hundred years since they had arrived in the mortal realm from the Heavens. However, they had spent all this time in hiding. Later, they also started their scamming journey with Jue Yin. They hadn\u2019t learned any survival skills whatsoever.Ever since they had been taken in by Shang Que and arrived at Luofeng, they hadn\u2019t had anything to do other than record those few songs. Though Yu Zhengdu had never made things difficult for them because of this, they themselves always felt very embarra.s.sed about it. Previously, they had even taken the initiative to attend Luofeng\u2019s technical skills training for employees. They learned how to use Excel and Powerpoint in addition to other modern work skills. Recently, they had just finished the training lessons and had successfully become honorable customer service representatives. Additionally, because of their clear and wonderful voices, they had received great reviews from all of their clients, becoming Luofeng\u2019s weekly \u201cCustomer Service Stars.\u201dNeither of the two kinnaras had thought that their opportunity for a career change would come so soon.Yu Zhengdu smiled and said, \u201cYou guys are currently incredibly popular online. You even have fans who are voting for you on music rankings all of their own accord. They\u2019ve already reached first on the wild ranking.\u201dThe two kinnaras exchanged eye contact. Though they rarely communicated with mortals, they had lived in the mortal realm for many years, after all. They more or less understand some mortal things.For example, they understood the concepts of the entertainment industry, fans, and music ranking votings that Yu Zhengdu had just mentioned. Only, they had never thought that they could possess these things. They also didn\u2019t know what it meant to have all these things.The female kinnara looked like she had reached an epiphany. \u201cSpeaking of, the faith we\u2019ve received recently has suddenly increased a lot. Could this be the reason?\u201dYu Zhengdu remembered the faith Shang Que had received due to his face and fell silent for a moment. He nodded and said, \u201cIf their love and support for you can be considered a type of faith, I a.s.sume so.\u201d\u201cJue Yin that old bald donkey!\u201d The male kinnara started cussing out of the blue, \u201cHe lied to us for so many years! Tricked us into suffering for so long!\u201dThe female kinnara very quickly realized this too. She cussed along, \u201cThat bald thief told us that we needed to start a cult in order to gather faith, that we needed to scam those old people! But he never told us that becoming popular could gain us faith too!\u201dThe male kinnara, outraged: \u201cAdditionally, the faith we\u2019re receiving is very obviously much more than before!\u201dThe more they spoke, the angrier they got. They used all the swear words they had learned in the mortal realm, completely disregarding the dignified aura that Western G.o.ds ought to have. They only wished that they could personally visit the prison and beat Jue Yin up.Yu Zhengdu broke out into a sweat from off to the side. No wonder people in the past said that doctors couldn\u2019t heal themselves: it seemed that although the kinnaras\u2019 music could help all sentient beings, it obviously couldn\u2019t calm down the kinnaras themselves.He waited until the two kinnaras had mostly finished cussing before waving his hands to signal for them to stop. He asked, \u201cSo, what are your thoughts right now?\u201dActually, Yu Zhengdu had considered their work problem previously too. The kinnaras had a natural talent for music. Only staying as customer service in Luofeng was honestly a bit of a waste. However, Luofeng wasn\u2019t really familiar with the music industry. Additionally, the kinnaras\u2019 music was also extremely unique. If things didn\u2019t get taken care of properly, it was very possible that they might get taken advantage of again, just like with Jue Yin. Because of the fact that the kinnaras had committed crimes before and were still serving time, he had always had a rather reserved outlook on this question.However, a change had occurred. The kinnaras had gone viral online and a professional entertainment company was now handing them an olive branch. If they themselves desired to enter the entertainment industry, it was entirely possible for them to receive a better plan.The two kinnaras exchanged eye contact. They read the meaning in each other\u2019s eyes. The male kinnara nodded and told Yu Zhengdu, \u201cIf you and CEO Shang hadn\u2019t saved us from Jue Yin, we couldn\u2019t possibly get so much faith. So\u2026\u2026we\u2019ll listen to the company\u2019s arrangements.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Yu Zhengdu looked at them. With a smile, he said, \u201cThen I suggest you guys debut.\u201dHe was doing this not because he hoped the kinnaras could earn a lot of money for their company, but because he now knew how important faith from mortals was to G.o.ds and ghosts. If allowing them to debut could give the kinnaras the faith they wanted, he naturally wouldn\u2019t stop them.The kinnaras revealed tentatively joyful expressions. However, they were still a bit worried. \u201cWill the Great Ghost King agree?\u201dSpeaking of Shang Que, Yu Zhengdu\u2019s mood became uncontrollably conflicted again. He couldn\u2019t help but think that Shang Que had always been very supportive of him\u2026\u2026He sighed softly to himself and said, \u201cI\u2019ll let him know. He won\u2019t be against it.\u201dThe kinnaras finally relaxed upon hearing this. \u201cThank you so much.\u201dHowever, the kinnaras weren\u2019t mortals, after all. It would be best if their activity was under Luofeng\u2019s careful management now that the Heavens and h.e.l.l had collapsed. As such, they reached an agreement after brief discussion that the kinnaras\u2019 labor contracts would still be signed to Luofeng. Their debut would be a collaborative effort and outsourced to a reliable management company. Luofeng and the management company would receive equal portions of dividends and the remaining amount would belong to the kinnaras. If they truly did become popular and start becoming busy, Luofeng could also a.s.sign them a specialized a.s.sistant.The kinnaras hadn\u2019t expected that they, two G.o.ds serving time for a crime, would get such an opportunity. They instantly felt incredibly grateful.After confirming the kinnaras\u2019 intentions, it was now time to resolve the kinnaras\u2019 appearances.The female kinnara was fine. She looked elegant and beautiful. Disregarding the fact that she knew how to play the harp and sing, even if she didn\u2019t know how to do anything, she was still more than qualified to debut as a popular vase .But the male kinnara was a bit more worrisome. The cla.s.sic characteristic of their tribe\u2019s males was the fact that they all had horse heads and human bodies. Forget debuting, it was even difficult to walk out the door while looking like this.The male kinnara knew that his physical appearance was a bit strange too. With tears in his eyes, he sobbed, \u201cIt must be impossible for someone like me to debut, right?\u201dYu Zhengdu stared at him, deep in thought. \u201cNot necessarily.\u201dQin Yuejian\u2019s company was called Star Path. It had started as a record label and was quite professional, but not very large. They didn\u2019t have a lot of great resources. Originally, they had managed to produce an extremely popular singer, but right after the singer had gotten popular, he had jumped s.h.i.+p to a big company. Fortunately, Qin Yuejian came along later on, allowing them to continue surviving.Yet, Qin Yuejian was mainly an actor. Because of this, Star Path had constantly hoped that they would be able to produce another celebrity musician. Only, the Chinese music industry was at an all time low these days. Though Star Path had a certain acc.u.mulation in regards to music, their newly debuted singers hadn\u2019t really been too successful.Previously, Qin Yuejian had told his company that his friend wanted to rent the company recording studios for a few days. Originally, the company had been rather unwilling, but because Qin Yuejian was the most popular male celebrity in their company, they had still rented it out to show respect for him. However, they hadn\u2019t paid much attention to the general situation.Until the kinnaras\u2019 music had gone viral online. Star Path hadn\u2019t even realized that those songs had been recorded in their recording studios. They only found out after Qin Yuejian offhandedly mentioned it during a meeting when this mysterious band had been brought up.Star Path felt incredibly regretful. Who would\u2019ve thought that Qin Yuejian\u2019s friend actually knew such extraordinary talents? And this was under the circ.u.mstances where they weren\u2019t professionals. They could already predict what kind of impact this mysterious band would have on the music industry given training and packaging provided by a professional team.Fortunately, it wasn\u2019t too late. With Qin Yuejian as the middleman, they managed to find Luofeng one step ahead of all the other management companies.This time, the person who had tagged along with Qin Yuejian was the music producer of Star Path.Yu Zhengdu and Xu Hui chatted for a bit. After confirming that the other party was very reliable in both collaborative intent and professionalism, considering the fact that Luofeng\u2019s situation was special, Yu Zhengdu decided that this company was obviously more suitable than any other company. Also, Qin Yuejian would be able to take care of the kinnaras if they signed to Star Path.Yu Zhengdu thought about it and decided to put Star Path at the top of his list. Of course, the further details of their collaboration would need to be taken care of by professionals.But currently, it was still necessary to have the kinnaras meet the representative from Star Path.\u201cLet me introduce everyone. These two are our company\u2019s employees and also the mysterious band members that you\u2019ve been looking for, Jin Na and Jin Luo.\u201d While speaking, Yu Zhengdu opened the door to the conference room, ushering the two kinnaras inside.To show their respect, Qin Yuejian and Xu Hui stood up. They looked in the direction of the door.The next moment, the two of them both revealed shocked expressions.A pause later, Xu Hui finally stuttered out, \u201cNice to meet you b-both.\u201dQin Yuejian was slightly speechless too. \u201cMiss Jin Na is very beautiful. Mr. Jin Luo\u2026\u2026is very interesting.\u201dOnly to see a man and a woman walk in. The woman was elegant and poised. The man stood up tall and straight. However, the man\u2019s head\u2026\u2026was covered in a rubber horse mask.Yu Zhengdu calmly stated, \u201cMr. Jin Luo is a bit shy. He has slight social anxiety, so doesn\u2019t like showing his face normally. I hope you\u2019ll be able to forgive him.\u201dQin Yuejian asked with wide eyes, \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean he needs to wear a horse mask?\u201dYu Zhengdu softly went . He added, \u201cHe normally likes to watch \u2018 BoJack Horseman .\u2019\u201dQin Yuejian, Xu Hui: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXu Hui was momentarily silent. He said, \u201cBut if Mr. Jin Luo is planning on debuting, it might not be super appropriate for him to keep wearing a horse head?\u201d\u201cWhy not?\u201d Yu Zhengdu asked. \u201cI\u2019ve already come up with a name for their band. They can be named Sagittarius.\u201dEveryone: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d<b>The author has something to say:</b>Peppa: I, rocket scientist goose (hands on hips)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Additionally, he listened to Yu Zhengdu\u2019s suggestion and decided to name their band \u201cSagittarius.\u201dThe details of the collaboration between Star Path and the band also needed to follow Luofeng\u2019s requests. The kinnaras\u2019 labor contracts were signed with Luofeng; the record label contract with Star Path would proceed in a production sharing manner. The songs\u2019 copyrights would be divided between their creators. Songs produced by Star Path would belong to Star Path, whereas the songs written by the kinnaras would belong to Luofeng.After reaching an agreement to collaborate, all they needed to do was hand all the legal issues over to the professionals. However, Xu Hui couldn\u2019t bear to leave so soon. He asked to have a private discussion with the kinnaras about their music.This discussion lasted all morning. When Xu Hui exited the guest conference room, his expression seemed dazed. He grabbed onto Qin Yuejian\u2019s hands and refused to let go. \u201cThis is the music of bliss! I feel like I\u2019m seeing Heaven\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWe used to value money and returns too much. How worldly and terrible. Music should be like theirs, pure\u2026\u2026\u201dQin Yuejian: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhile Xu Hui communicated with the kinnaras, Qin Yuejian also sneakily pulled Yu Zhengdu into the corner to say, \u201cCEO Yu, since I\u2019m already here, let me make a call to Keji.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIn order to preserve the balance between the Underworld and mortal realm, even Luofeng\u2019s VIP annual package customers had strict regulations about the number of times they could call and how long their calls to the Underworld could be. However, though Qin Yuejian and Zhan Keji were already separated by death, they still had endless things to say to each other. Qin Yuejian would often come up with new excuses to make calls to Zhan Keji.For example, this time, Qin Yuejian had technically helped Luofeng out. Yu Zhengdu couldn\u2019t reject him so resolutely. After a brief pause, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll let you text him.\u201dQin Yuejian: \u201c\u2026\u2026Okay.\u201dQin Yuejian was just about to find Luofeng\u2019s VIP customer service representative to help him send a text message when Yu Zhengdu tugged him back again on second thought. \u201cOh right, I have a question I want to ask you.\u201dQin Yuejian took two steps back. \u201cWhat?\u201dYu Zhengdu looked around and, after confirming that no one else was present, quietly asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you have experience about being pursued by a male friend? I want to ask \u2013 how would you clarify things with them if you\u2019re not planning on dating them but also don\u2019t want them to feel sad?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve actually never thought about that question.\u201d Qin Yuejian rubbed his chin. \u201cYou know, too. When Keji and I confessed to each other, he was already dead. Right now, we want to date each other, but can\u2019t\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026I mean theoretically.\u201dQin Yuejian looked at him curiously. \u201cCould it be that you have a male friend who\u2019s currently pursuing you?\u201dYu Zhengdu muttered, \u201cYou could say that.\u201dThough the other believed that Yu Zhengdu was pursuing him, Shang Que\u2019s behavior made things very obvious. Even if Yu Zhengdu was a rock, he would still understand Shang Que\u2019s feelings.Qin Yuejian pondered for a moment before asking, \u201cYou want to reject him? But also don\u2019t want to hurt him?\u201dYu Zhengdu fell silent. He neither confirmed nor denied this, only adding, \u201cOne more thing. He\u2019s one of my best friends. I don\u2019t want to ruin our relations.h.i.+p because of this incident\u2026\u2026\u201dQin Yuejian\u2019s gaze became meaningful as he looked over. \u201cWhy do I feel like you\u2019re not super intent on rejecting him?\u201dYu Zhengdu was confused. \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201dQin Yuejian waved his hands around. \u201cThese situations are quite normal in the entertainment industry. From what I know, if a normal straight person found out a gay person liked them, their first response would definitely be to avoid them. Even if they had a good relations.h.i.+p in the past, he would still slowly distance himself. It\u2019s very rare that anyone would try to preserve their original relations.h.i.+p.\u201d\u201cIf you know he likes you, but your first response isn\u2019t to get as far away as possible from him and instead is to worry about how not to harm him, which implies you\u2019re looking out for him\u2026\u2026\u201d Qin Yuejian raised an eyebrow suggestively. \u201cMost likely, you\u2019re not straight either.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026How come I\u2019ve suddenly become gay during this conversation with you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m only sharing my experience,\u201d Qin Yuejian said. \u201cIf you\u2019re sure that you\u2019re straight, then just clearly tell him. There will always be some harm, more or less, when you reject someone\u2026\u2026\u201dHe gazed at Yu Zhengdu deeply. \u201cOf course, if you\u2019re completely unwilling to harm him, might as well simply accept his advances.\u201dYu Zhendu: \u201c\u2026\u2026Thanks for your suggestion.\u201dThough Qin Yuejian\u2019s logical reasoning was strange, he had been right about one thing. Only now did Yu Zhengdu realize that since finding out about Shang Que\u2019s feelings, he had only been preoccupied with finding out a way to reject Shang Que without hurting his feelings. He had never felt uncomfortable because of this incident, or felt a desire to distance himself and avoid Shang Que.Except, this incident had occurred too suddenly. He couldn\u2019t tell at this moment if he was only used to being in such close proximity to Shang Que all the time or if he actually wasn\u2019t that straight.Yu Zhengdu rubbed his face. By now, he himself was bewildered.But no matter how bewildered he was, this conflict was a personal matter. Before he could straighten out his thoughts, he absolutely didn\u2019t want Shang Que to keep misunderstanding.Yu Zhengdu inhaled deeply. If he was going to be a sc.u.mbag, he was going to be a straightforward and deliberate sc.u.mbag.He pieced together his speech and courageously opened the door to Shang Que\u2019s office. \u201cBoss, let\u2019s have a heart-to-heart discussion.\u201dOnly to see Shang Que, who had been excitedly planning how to raise a daughter just this morning, peek his head out from behind his computer monitor, expression slightly sorrowful and wronged. Angrily, he said, \u201cNo!\u201dYu Zhengdu blanked for a moment. It must be known that Shang Que had never spoken to him in this tone of voice before.He was temporarily confused. Dazed, he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201dShang Que glared straight at him, eyes filled with the complaint one felt towards a boyfriend. \u201cI hadn\u2019t expected that you would do such a thing behind my back!\u201dYu Zhengdu\u2019s heart skipped a beat. Could it be that Shang Que already knew what he was thinking?But he hadn\u2019t even done anything yet?!Yu Zhengdu facepalmed and took a step forward. \u201cBoss, listen to me\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI refuse to listen!\u201d Shang Que stood up and pushed him out of the office. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m one-sidedly announcing that I\u2019m in a cold war with you!\u201dWith a slam, the office door got closed.Yu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe stood outside the door, dazed, before heaving out a long exhale. The situation he was most unwilling to see had ultimately occurred. Perhaps his relations.h.i.+p with Shang Que would become ice-cold from now on. He didn\u2019t know if there was even a possibility of them returning to the way things were before\u2026\u2026Yu Zhengdu tiredly rubbed the spot between his eyebrows, then dragged his heavy feet towards his desk.At this moment, Kang Jin cautiously scooted up next to him. Guiltily, he said, \u201cXiao Yu, I\u2019m truly sorry\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu slowly turned around. Confused, he asked, \u201cWhy are you apologizing to me?\u201dKang Jin twiddled his fingers. \u201cJust, you know, I caused you to get scolded by Boss\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t do it on purpose. I just accidentally switched to the wrong group chat.\u201d Kang Jin covered his head while quickly running away. \u201cTake a look in the company group chat for yourself!\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c???\u201dHe furrowed his brows and realized that this incident wasn\u2019t so simple. He hurriedly returned to his desk and opened the company group chat. Instantly, he went: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe scrolled up the chat history and saw that shortly after he had left to discuss the collaboration with Star Path, Shang Que had happily uploaded a picture of a big white goose wearing a dress:\u3010Isn\u2019t this dress very cute?\u3011Because Kang Jin had clicked into the wrong group, and also because he probably hadn\u2019t looked at the username closely, he quickly replied:\u3010Hahahahaha, isn\u2019t this the same kind as in Boss\u2019s changing game?\u3011Not only this, he also immediately sent over a screenshot:\u3010Look, a similarly cute Boss!\u3011Yu Zhengdu looked at the screenshot Kang Jin had sent. Only to feel his vision go black.That was clearly the stress-relieving mini program he had created in a bout of pa.s.sion just after joining Luofeng because he had been experiencing too much work stress and was also constantly faced with Boss\u2019s strange ideas\u2014\u2014the Ghost King changing game.Later on, this mini game had accidentally gotten discovered by his coworkers. And after that, it had spread like wildfire among them.Because the main character\u2019s image was so familiar and well-directed, this game was extremely popular among Luofeng employees. Additionally, it was quite enduring: as the creator, Yu Zhengdu was forced to regularly upgrade the game.Until now, this game had already been upgraded five times. The Ghost King had over two hundred sets of clothes, much more than the actual Shang Que.There were a mult.i.tude of clothing styles too, including but not limited to uniforms, dresses, swimwear, etc. Among these, a pink maid outfit received lots of compliments. It was currently the most collected style by players.And the screenshot Kang Jin had sent was exactly the Ghost King wearing a maid uniform while making finger hearts.After Kang Jin sent his messages, the group chat welcomed a message-less period of two minutes.Two minutes later, Shang Que sent again:\u3010?\u3011Only now did Kang Jin belatedly recognize Boss\u2019s ID.Kang Jin:\u3010\u2026\u2026\u3011Kang Jin:\u3010Boss, I don\u2019t want my salary for this month anymore!\u3011Shang Que:\u3010What is that?\u3011The chat fell into a suffocating bout of silence, until Shang Que used his ultimate move:\u3010Explain, one by one. Those who refuse, put chopped scallion and c.u.min on yourself and come to my office\u3011What followed after was a large-scale betrayal.His coworkers quickly uploaded their precious screenshots \u2013 various swimwear Ghost Kings, sailor Ghost Kings, and evening gown Ghost Kings spammed the chat. Among them, there was also a special outfit, Cleopatra , that had been a limited release collectible to celebrate the Life and Death Accounts system being released online.Yu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt had to be said that Shang Que probably truly liked him, because he had only announced a cold war instead of eating him on the spot.Shang Que was extremely resolute this time. He said he wanted a cold war, so really did start a cold war. For the whole day, he didn\u2019t say a word to Yu Zhengdu.Yu Zhengdu was in a pretty bad mood for the rest of the day. Part of the reason was because he was stressed about their \u201cromance\u201d. He wanted to clear things up with Shang Que, but Shang Que was in the midst of anger. Bringing this topic up would be the equivalent of adding oil to a fire. Additionally, Shang Que refused to speak to him, so he honestly couldn\u2019t find an opportunity to talk to him.Another reason was that he felt that he ought to apologize to Shang Que first, to dispel Shang Que\u2019s anger before speaking about anything else. However, there was a similar problem with this scenario\u2026\u2026He couldn\u2019t even enter Shang Que\u2019s office. His WeChat messages had all been blocked too.Since Yu Zhengdu had started working at Luofeng, there hadn\u2019t been a single day that had been so awkward. After finally surviving to the end of the work day, Shang Que\u2019s office door was still closed shut.He specially worked overtime for a bit, but Shang Que\u2019s office door was very resolute too. It didn\u2019t budge at all. It seemed likely that it wouldn\u2019t open for him again today.With no other option, Yu Zhengdu could only put his phone in his pocket and leave the company. He planned on carefully coming up with a plan after getting home to get Boss to stop being so angry.Yu Zhengdu exited the technology park. By now, it was already rather late. There were a lot of people who worked overtime in the technology park, making it difficult to get a taxi at night. He was too lazy to fight other people for one too. In a daze, he walked up to the bus stop and waited.He had pretty good luck. Only a few moments after he got to the bus stop, a bus arrived. Yu Zhengdu was stressed about stuff, so only casually scanned the bus number; upon noticing that it didn\u2019t seem wrong, he got on the bus.As soon as he did so, a chilling gust of cold air ambushed him, causing him to s.h.i.+ver.Yu Zhengdu instantly realized something was wrong. He came back to his senses and looked over the people on the bus. Shortly thereafter, he went: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dBy now, the bus doors had already closed and the bus had already started driving again.Yu Zhengdu calmly told the driver, \u201c s.h.i.+fu , I apologize. I\u2019m going to have to trouble you to stop for a moment. I got on the wrong bus.\u201dThe driver turned around, revealing a greenish-black face. With a terrifying smile, he said, \u201cYoung man, if you accidentally get on this bus, it isn\u2019t so easy to get off.\u201dWhile the driver spoke, the other people on the bus turned around to look at Yu Zhengdu too. Only to see that everybody on this bus had greenish, pale faces and chilling smiles.Yu Zhengdu had clearly gotten on a ghost bus.The driver\u2019s smile became even scarier. \u201cYoung man, do you know what bus you\u2019ve gotten on?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Yu Zhengdu calmly handed the driver a business card. \u201cI\u2019m an employee at Luofeng. If you keep trying to scare me, I\u2019m going to report you when I get back to the company.\u201dDriver: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe other ghosts on the bus: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter the driver looked at the business card, he became so frightened that tears formed in his eyes. \u201cSo it\u2019s Boss Y-Yu, ! I was wrong! I just wanted to play a joke earlier. Please don\u2019t report me!\u201d\u201cI was only joking with you too,\u201d Yu Zhengdu drawled out. \u201cHurry and stop the bus to let me off.\u201d\u201cNo need, no need,\u201d the driver said ingratiatingly. \u201cJust take a seat. I\u2019ll circle around and send you directly home.\u201dThe other ghosts on the bus instantly nodded. \u201cWe\u2019re not in a rush. We can send you back first.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026There\u2019s no need.\u201d\u201cThere is a need.\u201d With an expression close to crying, the driver said, \u201cWe have rules too. In order to avoid disrupting the order of mortal society, we aren\u2019t allowed to make random stops.\u201dYu Zhengdu rubbed his forehead. \u201cThen I\u2019ll get off at the next stop.\u201dDriver: \u201c\u2026\u2026The next stop is the suburban cemetery site.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201cBut stopping at my house isn\u2019t breaking the rules?\u201dThe driver laughed, slightly embarra.s.sed. \u201cIt is, but I\u2019ve heard that if it\u2019s done for CEO Yu, the Ghost King normally won\u2019t get angry.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe waved his hands, fatigued. \u201cOkay, then just drive to my house, I guess.\u201d\u201cAlrighty.\u201d As if he had been forgiven, the driver stepped on the gas pedal and sped off.Yu Zhengdu was treating a bus like a taxi. He felt extremely conflicted too. While squeezing through the bus full of ghosts to the back of the bus \u2013 he originally intended to sit next to the back door \u2013 he was stopped halfway by an old man who reached out and grabbed him. \u201cYoung man, there\u2019s a seat next to me. Sit here.\u201dYu Zhengdu froze. The old man who had grabbed onto him was clearly a living person.At the same time, a ghost sidled up to Yu Zhengdu\u2019s ear and said, \u201cBoss Yu, our bus originally wasn\u2019t going to stop at the technology park, but for some reason, this old man accidentally got on the wrong bus. That\u2019s why we risked breaking regulation to stop over there, because we wanted him to get off. In the end, though, he refused to get off no matter what. Instead, you got on.\u201dYu Zhengdu reached a realization. It turned out that a total of two living people had gotten onto this ghost bus. Only, the spirits on the bus knew when to stop joking around. At least they hadn\u2019t scared this elderly man, instead doing their best to pretend to be normal humans.That spirit lowly said, \u201cBoss Yu, when we get to your house in a bit, I\u2019ll have to trouble you to get this elderly man off with you.\u201dYu Zhengdu nodded. As if nothing was wrong, he sat down next to the old man. Just as he was about to find a topic to start a conversation with the old man, that old man leaned over first. He lowered his voice and seriously stated, \u201cYoung man, don\u2019t make a sound. Calmly listen to me. The bus you\u2019ve just gotten on is a ghost bus.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAnd the ghosts on the bus were acting so diligently. Turns out the old man had already discovered long ago?The old man nodded his head, pleased, after noticing that Yu Zhengdu truly didn\u2019t make a sound. He continued, \u201cI was going to get off the bus just now, but noticed that you accidentally got on. I was scared that you would get harmed by these ghosts, so could only get back on too. Don\u2019t be frightened. We just need to pretend like we don\u2019t know anything. In a bit, follow my lead. We\u2019ll find an opportunity to jump off\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThough the old man had good intentions, he still needed to say \u2026\u2026<b>The author has something to say:</b>Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 81": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/New Times, New HellChapter 82 - Ghost BusPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 82 - Ghost BusInconspicuously, Yu Zhengdu softly asked the old man, \u201cHow do you know that this is a ghost bus?\u201dThe old man\u2019s beard trembled as he said, \u201cI saw them paying the fare with yellow papers.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe asked curiously, \u201cHow did you get on this bus?\u201dThe old man himself was a bit confused. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened either. I was just doing what I normally do. I went to the market and bought groceries, then took a walk around the park on the way back. After, I got on the bus to head home. I\u2019ve never encountered such a strange occurrence before.\u201dYu Zhengdu glanced next to his feet. As expected, there was a bag of vegetables placed there. He had a slight sensation that something was off. Logically speaking, if the old man had done what he normally did, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to see the ghost bus in the first place.However, he couldn\u2019t successfully come up with an explanation at the moment. As such, he only gently patted the old man\u2019s wrist and lowered his voice to placate, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be scared. All we have to do is slowly get off the bus in a bit. Let\u2019s not jump off.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not scared. There\u2019s nothing to be scared of at my age.\u201d The grandpa observed Yu Zhengdu, gaze full of praise. \u201cYou, on the other hand, are very good at keeping your calm, young man. Not even yelling after encountering such a situation.\u201dYu Zhengdu smiled modestly. He felt too ashamed to tell the old man that he had just scared all the ghosts on the bus earlier.Thus, this bus, full of ghosts who believed they had done a good job acting like humans and an old man who believed he had done a good job acting like he hadn\u2019t found out, maintained a strange sense of balance. Just like this, it headed towards the neighborhood Yu Zhengdu was renting from.At the destination, the driver kept up the act and parked next to the bus stop outside Yu Zhengdu\u2019s neighborhood. He shouted, \u201cPa.s.sengers at your stop, please disembark the bus quickly.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s get off.\u201d Yu Zhengdu helped the old man up.\u201cKeep calm, don\u2019t panic.\u201d The old man acted like he was in a spy movie. He pushed Yu Zhengdu. \u201cYou walk up front, I\u2019ll be on guard behind. If anything goes wrong, hurry and run. Don\u2019t worry about me.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt had to be said that Grandpa truly had a sense of justice. However, he was also very dramatic.Either way, they had already reached their destination. He didn\u2019t mind accompanying the old man in acting for a bit longer. Consequently, he carefully walked in the front. Just as he was about to get off the bus, a young man walked in through the front doors.A living person.That youth had slippers on his feet. He was wearing a cheap, black leather jacket that was balding in many different places. His entire being exuded scoundrelly vibes. He offhandedly tossed two coins into the coin machines, then lowered his gaze and headed to the back of the bus.Yu Zhengdu stopped in his tracks. The other ghosts on the bus froze as well.What was wrong with this ghost bus? How come so many living people had gotten on it in one night?The old man, who was in the midst of pus.h.i.+ng Yu Zhengdu off the bus, was so agitated he almost stomped his feet. He lowered his voice and said, \u201cAiyo, what\u2019s wrong? How come another person got on? Someone definitely doesn\u2019t want me getting off the bus!\u201dYu Zhengdu furrowed his brows and looked at the youth. He discovered that the other\u2019s expression was very dark; his eyes were murky and his eyebags made up almost half his face. This was the face of someone with very bad luck.That youth squeezed his way to the back of the bus. Upon discovering that the bus was still parked in place, he yelled out, impatient, \u201cIs the driver dead? How come you aren\u2019t driving?\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u2026\u2026The old man was very exasperated too. \u201cEy, young people truly have no brain to mouth filter.\u201dHe pushed Yu Zhengdu. \u201cYou get off first. I\u2019ll go tell that young man.\u201dGrandpa didn\u2019t wait to see Yu Zhengdu\u2019s reaction. He squeezed his way over to the youth after speaking.Yu Zhengdu looked up and discovered that the youth\u2019s gaze was flitting. He was darkly observing everybody on the bus. Yu Zhengdu\u2019s instincts told him something was wrong. He hurriedly made to call the old man back.But it was already too late. Though Grandpa was old, he was extremely agile. By now, he had already made it to the youth\u2019s side. He scooted his head close and whispered, \u201cYoung man, hurry and get off the bus\u2026\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish speaking, that leather jacketed youth suddenly exploded. He grabbed the old man\u2019s neck with one arm and trapped him. With the other, he pulled out a pocket knife and unfolded it. He pressed the knife against the old man\u2019s neck and spit. \u201cStinkin\u2019 old man. This is what you get for not minding your own business.\u201dWith Grandpa as a hostage, the youth angrily told the driver, \u201cWhat are you still parked here for? Hurry and drive. Otherwise, I\u2019m going to stab this old man.\u201dThe sharp blade was pressed against Grandpa\u2019s neck. It could pierce into the flesh at any moment. Yu Zhengdu\u2019s expression changed. He coldly told the driver, \u201cDrive.\u201dThe ghost bus once again started moving. However, it was completely silent inside. There was no indication of panic or terror.That youth hadn\u2019t realized this. He cussed to himself, \u201cYou deserve all this misfortune. You encountered laozi after I consecutively lost two days\u2019 worth of money. So f.u.c.king unfortunate\u2026\u2026\u201dUpon hearing this, Yu Zhengdu instantly reached a realization. Gambling would affect one\u2019s mental state and luck. This person\u2019s luck had originally been bad. In addition to gambling and the fact that he was in a bad mood, he would naturally start losing more and more money. This made his luck worse. Under these circ.u.mstances, it wasn\u2019t the slightest bit strange that he would accidentally get into a ghost bus.The old man sighed, \u201cYoung man, that wasn\u2019t your only bout of misfortune\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d In certain regards, Grandpa could be considered quite funny.The youth obviously couldn\u2019t appreciate Grandpa\u2019s humor. He gestured with his knife while yelling, \u201cShut up, dumb old man.\u201dThe bus wobbled as it drove. Yu Zhengdu watched as the knife swung around next to the old man\u2019s neck. His heart tightened and he inconspicuously glanced around the bus. He discovered that the Underworld spirits on the bus were also silently looking at him. They were obviously waiting for his instructions.A spirit next to him lowly said, \u201cBoss Yu, this person has really bad luck right now. He can be possessed. How about I possess him?\u201dYu Zhengdu waved his hands. \u201cDon\u2019t. Possessing a living person breaks regulation. Your Good and Evil Scores will be affected.\u201dThe spirit could only give up. He revealed a stressed expression. \u201cThen what can we do?\u201dYu Zhengdu\u2019s gaze fell on the spirit of a young woman. An idea struck. He pointed at her and told the leather jacketed youth, \u201cHey, look. How about using her as the hostage instead of Grandpa?\u201dAs soon as he suggested this, before the leather jacketed youth could say anything, Grandpa became agitated first. \u201cYoung man, how could you blindly come up with such a plan\u2026\u2026\u201dRight now wasn\u2019t the time to continue acting with the old man. Yu Zhengdu was afraid that the old man would expose the truth in panic, causing the youth to lose his grip. He hurriedly said, \u201cGrandpa, don\u2019t worry. I know them.\u201dAll the ghosts on the bus quickly nodded. They swung their arms around Yu Zhengdu\u2019s shoulders and told Grandpa, \u201cWe\u2019re really close. We\u2019re all good ghosts who don\u2019t harm people.\u201dOld man: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe old man looked at Yu Zhengdu, shocked. Then, he looked at all the ghosts on the bus. His eyes instantly started rolling up into his head. He looked like he was only a second away from pa.s.sing out. This scared the ghosts on the bus greatly.Fortunately, the old man was very strong. In the end, he recovered: as expected from an experienced individual. After his initial shock, he quickly calmed down and swallowed all the questions he had. He calmly told the robber, \u201cYoung man, how about you have that little girl over there replace me?\u201dThe leather jacketed youth had originally been guarded because Yu Zhengdu, a tall young man, had spoken up. Then, he had watched as they suddenly started a discussion. Just as he was getting impatient, they unexpectedly changed the topic and suggested having the little girl replace the old man.The youth looked in the direction Yu Zhengdu was pointing. Instantly, his guarded expression became l.u.s.ty. \u201cIf the chick\u2019s willing, I don\u2019t mind either.\u201dThat was a young woman wearing a long dress. Her long, black hair was down and she was quite pretty.After getting looked at by him, the girl covered her face in fright. Terrified, she yelled, \u201cAiya, I\u2019m scared. How could you guys treat me in this manner?!\u201dAll the ghosts on the bus joined in and pushed her forward. \u201cRespecting the elderly and caring for the children are the responsibilities of all young people! You must go!\u201dThe leather jacketed youth burst into laughter upon seeing this. \u201cYes yes yes. Little beauty, you ought to help the elderly.\u201dThus, the girl got pushed in front of the youth with great reluctance. The youth held the pocket knife up to her throat and quickly pushed the old man away. Then, he wrapped his arms around her and casually buried his face against her neck. He revealed a mocking and lewd smile. \u201cThis bus is really interesting. You worked together to sacrifice a little girl. You truly know how to respect the elderly and care for the children.\u201dIf Yu Zhengdu had pointed at anyone else on the bus, the leather jacketed youth definitely wouldn\u2019t have agreed to switch hostages. But since he had pointed at a pet.i.te little girl, things were completely different.Yu Zhengdu was too lazy to bother arguing with the youth. He hurriedly walked forward and helped the old man regain his balance. He asked, \u201cGrandpa, are you okay?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Grandpa patted his chest and gave Yu Zhengdu a meaningful look. \u201cYoung man, I couldn\u2019t tell that you have such a large social circle.\u201dYu Zhengdu humbly said, \u201cJust a coincidence.\u201dAt this time, the leather jacketed youth \u2013 who was hugging his new hostage \u2013 finally ran out of patience. He waved his knife around and said, \u201cHey, all of you. Hurry and give me all your money. Otherwise, I\u2019m going to be impolite to her.\u201dAs soon as he stopped speaking, the originally terrified little girl suddenly turned her head around and slowly asked, \u201cOh, how are you planning to be impolite to me?\u201d\u201cHehehehehe.\u201d The youth looked down at her with a lewd smile. \u201cWhat do you think\u2026\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish speaking, he suddenly widened both his eyes. He couldn\u2019t get the remaining half of his sentence out either.Only to see that the little girl he had a tight grasp on was looking at him with her whole head twisted 180 degrees.\u201cY-you, you\u2026\u2026\u201d The youth\u2019s voice kept trembling. Because of excessive shock, he temporarily forgot to push her away. Instead, he reflexively looked at everyone else on the bus. \u201cDo you guys see her neck?\u201d\u201cYep,\u201d all the ghosts on the bus responded. And then, they turned their necks 180 degrees in sync, just like the girl. \u201cWe can do it too.\u201dLeather jacketed youth: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOnly to see his eyes roll into the back of his head before he fainted and fell straight back.\u201cWow, what a chicken. How come he\u2019s not even as brave as Grandpa?\u201d Yu Zhengdu shook his head and \u2019d. He turned around to look at Grandpa. \u201cRight?\u201dOnly to see Grandpa clutching his heart, eyes rolling into the back of his head. His entire body was on the brink of collapse. \u201cN-n-no, I\u2019m scared too\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Yu Zhengdu hurriedly helped stabilize the old man. He told all the ghosts, \u201cHurry and straighten your heads out. You\u2019re scaring Grandpa.\u201dFortunately, Grandpa was unexpectedly strong. He didn\u2019t even pa.s.s out given the circ.u.mstances. Once again, he calmed down. His tenacity for life aroused great admiration from all the ghosts on the bus.Finally, the driver braved the risk of breaking regulation again and dropped them off outside the police station. This time, the old man finally got off the bus successfully.After exiting the police station, Yu Zhengdu realized that it was already very late. Grandpa wasn\u2019t young anymore, either. He didn\u2019t dare to let Grandpa head home alone, so suggested accompanying him home. The old man waved his hands. \u201cNo need. Wouldn\u2019t you get home even later if you sent me home first?\u201dYu Zhengdu knew that Grandpa was kind and probably didn\u2019t want to waste his time. Thus, he didn\u2019t persevere. He only said, \u201cHow about this. I\u2019ll contact your family and tell them to come pick you up.\u201dGrandpa thought about it and agreed, then pulled out his phone to make a call. When he looked down, though, he couldn\u2019t help furrowing his brows. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? My phone\u2019s out of batteries?\u201dYu Zhengdu pulled out his own phone. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Do you remember your home phone number? I can call for you.\u201dThe old man nodded and gave Yu Zhengdu his son\u2019s phone number.Yu Zhengdu called the number. Shortly after, someone picked up. Yu Zhengdu said, \u201ch.e.l.lo, may I ask if this is Mr. Chen\u2026\u2026This is the situation. I encountered your father, Old Mr. Chen, on the bus today. We ran into some trouble, so it\u2019s rather late now\u2026\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish speaking, the other person suddenly started yelling at him, \u201cBlasted scammer! Aren\u2019t you scared of getting struck by lightning after saying such things?!\u201dYu Zhengdu was startled because he had suddenly gotten yelled at. However, he very quickly regained his wits. Right now, there were a lot of telephone scam calls. The other probably considered him a scammer. He hurriedly explained, \u201cMr. Chen, I\u2019m not a scammer. Let me finish\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd you still say you\u2019re not a scammer!\u201d The other\u2019s emotions seemed to be slightly out of control. Tone angry, but also slightly mocking, he shouted, \u201cI guess you haven\u2019t heard that my father just pa.s.sed away!\u201dSomething snapped into place in Yu Zhengdu\u2019s brain. He instinctively turned to look at Old Mr. Chen. This glance caused him to abruptly break out in cold sweat.Only to see that there were clearly two cuts on Old Mr. Chen\u2019s neck. The wounds were very fresh, like the flesh had just been sliced. They had probably been accidentally created when that leather jacketed youth had been waving his knife around. However, there was no blood flowing out of the wounds. Thus, he hadn\u2019t discovered them at first.As the victim, Old Mr. Chen obviously hadn\u2019t noticed anything either.He couldn\u2019t feel anything.Not only this \u2013 after carefully observing the old mister\u2019s exposed skin, one would realize that in certain places, he seemed to already be exhibiting signs of livor mortis.Fortunately, Yu Zhengdu was someone who had witnessed many things before. In only a moment, he had an idea. Before Mr. Chen hung up, he rapidly said, \u201cMr. Chen, please listen to this old mister\u2019s voice first.\u201dHe held the phone up to Old Mr. Chen\u2019s ear. Old Mr. Chen said, \u201ch.e.l.lo? Ah Xin , I\u2019m with Xiao Yu at the police station on Academy Street. Drive over and come pick me up. Don\u2019t trouble the nice young man\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter the old mister said this, Yu Zhengdu quickly grabbed the phone back. He asked, \u201cMr. Chen, did you hear the old mister\u2019s voice?\u201dThere was a long silence on the other end of the phone. After an unknown amount of time, Mr. Chen finally spoke up. His voice was filled with disbelief, \u201cMy father is really with you? He\u2019s still alive?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think so, but I also can\u2019t really comprehend the situation,\u201d Yu Zhengdu lowered his voice and answered. He calmly said, \u201cI\u2019d like to ask you to make a trip over, please. We\u2019ll discuss further then.\u201dMr. Chen hurriedly asked for the address. \u201cI\u2019m heading out right now.\u201dAfter hanging up, Yu Zhengdu sent him a text message explaining matters. Mr. Chen was quite agreeable. He very quickly replied.According to Mr. Chen\u2019s response, Old Mr. Chen had pa.s.sed away in his sleep the day before yesterday. According to their ancestral customs, they had sent the old mister\u2019s body to an ancestral temple in the suburbs for a day. They had been planning on getting him cremated after a religious ceremony.Unexpectedly, when they had woken up this morning, the old mister\u2019s corpse had disappeared.Because the news had reported about a few corpse robbing incidents a few years ago, Mr. Chen\u2019s family\u2019s first reaction was that someone had stolen Old Mr. Chen\u2019s corpse. Their entire family was furious and had paced around their home for the entire day. This was the reason why Mr. Chen had been so agitated upon receiving Yu Zhengdu\u2019s call.After getting the whole story, Yu Zhengdu thought back on Old Mr. Chen\u2019s behavior this whole trip. Those things he had found slightly strange in the beginning could finally be explained.No wonder why Old Mr. Chen had clearly been doing what he normally did but accidentally got onto a ghost bus. No wonder why he had clearly almost pa.s.sed out a few times after being scared by the ghosts on the bus but remained fine. No wonder why he, as an elderly individual, could still move so agilely\u2026\u2026Obviously, the old man was no longer alive. However, for some unknown reason, he was still using his physical body. Thus, Yu Zhengdu and the bus full of ghosts hadn\u2019t discovered this situation.Yu Zhengdu reached an epiphany. He had seen quite a few ghosts at Luofeng, but this was his first time encountering one in the situation Old Mr. Chen was in. He temporarily didn\u2019t know what to do.He pulled out his phone and instinctively made to contact Shang Que. When he opened WeChat and saw all the messages that had failed to be sent, he finally remembered that Shang Que was in the middle of a cold war with him.Actually, even if Shang Que wasn\u2019t in a cold war with him, considering his emotional state right now, it still wouldn\u2019t be suitable to go looking for Shang Que as soon as he encountered trouble.A strange feeling of annoyance rose in Yu Zhengdu\u2019s heart. This annoyance had already plagued him the entire day, but he couldn\u2019t pinpoint why he was feeling this way and also couldn\u2019t make the feeling go away.He sighed, then opened the company group chat. He shared a brief summary of the situation he had come across and asked:\u3010Are any ghosts free right now to come over and help me resolve this problem?\u3011Kang Jin probably felt very guilty in his heart. He quickly replied:\u3010I\u2019m free. Wait a moment\u3011But soon after he sent this message, Shang Que replied too:\u3010You\u2019re not free\u3011Kang Jin thought this was Shang Que forbidding him from helping Yu Zhengdu.

He closed his eyes and chanted the Ghost King\u2019s Seal silently to himself.When he opened his eyes again, he saw that a familiar figure was already standing before him.Thin and tall, handsome in appearance. Though he was simply standing there quietly, he could give Yu Zhengdu a sense of security.The annoyance that had been plaguing Yu Zhengdu all day suddenly completely disappeared.Only now did he realize that after merely a day, he actually kind of missed Shang Que.Yu Zhengdu gently moved his lips, \u201cXiao Shang\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not listening!\u201d Shang Que covered both his ears. With an elegant, cold expression, he said, \u201cI\u2019m still in a cold war with you!\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d<b>The author has something to say:</b>Shang Que: I have principles!Yu Zhengdu: Can\u2019t keep this man around!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Reluctantly, he said, \u201cIf you\u2019re adamant about speaking\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t say anything else.\u201d Yu Zhengdu stared at him, eyes sincere. His gaze became gentler. \u201cReally.\u201dShang Que: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThough he had been the one to first say that he wasn\u2019t listening, for some reason, he suddenly felt like he had been refuted.At this time, the voice of a confused old man sounded out from behind Yu Zhengdu. \u201cXiao Yu, is this your friend?\u201d\u201cYes, he\u2019s come to pick me up,\u201d Yu Zhengdu replied to Old Mr. Chen. Upon seeing that Shang Que still had a strict expression on to maintain his ghostly image of being a domineering CEO, he burst into laughter in his heart. However, his expression was completely blank. He changed the topic and asked, \u201cBoss, can you tell what\u2019s wrong with the old mister?\u201dGiven these circ.u.mstances, Shang Que could no longer set down his own pride and ask Yu Zhengdu what he had been about to say. He only softly hummed, then looked around Yu Zhengdu to glance at the old man. He calmly stated, \u201cHe\u2019s a living dead person.\u201dYu Zhengdu was lost. \u201cWhat\u2019s a living dead person?\u201dShang Que gestured with his chin. \u201cTake another look at him.\u201dYu Zhengdu turned around. The old mister was sitting on a bench on the side of the street. The street lamp lit his form up, rendering the livor mortis on his skin even more visible. However, he himself was completely oblivious to this and was even quietly humming a song. After noticing their gazes, he cheerfully smiled and gestured, \u201cCome sit.\u201dShang Que: \u201cHe hasn\u2019t realized that he\u2019s already died yet.\u201dUpon hearing this, Yu Zhengdu instantly reached an epiphany. This was the most critical point of understanding this entire situation. In the beginning, the reason that he hadn\u2019t discovered that the old mister was already dead was actually because the old mister had acted too much like a normal person the entire time.Not the forced feeling that dead people pretending to be alive gave off. Instead, it was an att.i.tude that seemed like he truly believed, from the bottom of his heart, that he was alive.Yu Zhengdu had originally thought that this was because the old mister had a good mentality, but now, it was obvious to tell that this was clearly because the old mister didn\u2019t even know that he had already pa.s.sed away.He asked, bewildered, \u201cHow could that happen?\u201dShang Que answered, \u201cWhen he died, that last breath of air didn\u2019t completely dissipate\u2026\u2026\u201dThe definition of a supposed living dead person was literal: a dead person that still looked alive. In actuality, this was because the last breath of air for some people didn\u2019t completely dissipate after their death. This occurred due to certain unknown reasons. Thus, the spirit would continue staying in the corpse. At this time, if the living dead person didn\u2019t realize that they had already died, it was possible that they would come back to \u201clife.\u201dAccording to Elder Chen\u2019s son\u2019s recounting, the old mister had pa.s.sed away in his sleep. It truly was very possible that he hadn\u2019t known that he had already died and merely thought that he had woken up from sleep.After a living dead person woke up, they would act like they normally did and continue on with their ordinary daily activities. Just like Old Mr. Chen \u2013 buying groceries like usual, taking a walk, then taking the bus home.Without outside disruptions, this condition could last for two to three days, until the last breath of air in his heart completely dissipated. Or, until the corpse completely decomposed and became unable to continue living.Yu Zhengdu furrowed his brows. \u201cThen\u2026\u2026do we have to wait until the old mister\u2019s body decomposes?\u201dHe wasn\u2019t scared to, but leaving a corpse to live like a normal person would definitely frighten a lot of other people. There might be several negative consequences.\u201cNo need.\u201d Shang Que shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019s a simple solution.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201cWhat solution?\u201dShang Que: \u201cDirectly telling him that he\u2019s already dead.\u201dLiving dead people came back to \u201clife\u201d because of a very important reason: they didn\u2019t know that they had already died. At this time, if you told them that they had already pa.s.sed away, their spirit would naturally leave the body.Yu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dNever in his wildest dreams had he thought that the answer would be so simple.Shang Que glanced at him, then lowered his gaze. \u201cAre you going to tell him? Or do you need me to go?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d Yu Zhengdu replied. He turned to look at the old man.The old mister was bent over, in the middle of examining the produce he had bought today. He muttered, \u201cAiya, I\u2019ve spent so much time outside that the leaves are already wilting\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHow about waiting a bit longer?\u201d Yu Zhengdu felt a bit sad. \u201cI\u2019ll tell him after his son arrives.\u201dShang Que didn\u2019t care either way.\u201cLet\u2019s sit first.\u201d As Yu Zhengdu spoke, he instinctively reached out to grab Shang Que\u2019s wrist.And then his hand got flung away by Shang Que.Yu Zhengdu froze for a moment, then turned around to look at him. Only to see Shang Que raise his chin and display an expression that read: \u201cI\u2019m still in a cold war with you.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe didn\u2019t know when Shang Que would completely forgive him either. The next few days at work would probably be pretty painful.At the end of the day, he was the one who had caused this mess. Yu Zhengdu wasn\u2019t shameless enough to refute him. He could only sulkily place his hand back into his pocket and tilt his head. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cWait,\u201d Shang Que stopped him.Yu Zhengdu looked back, slightly bewildered. He was just about to ask Shang Que what else he wanted, only to see Shang Que silently hold out a finger. With a reluctant expression, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re only allowed to hold this much.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu burst into laughter. Exasperated, he held onto Shang Que\u2019s defined finger. Very seriously, he said, \u201cThank you, Boss, for being so forgiving.\u201dThe roads were empty at night. Elder Chen\u2019s son, Chen Xin, arrived very quickly. Prior to his arrival, Yu Zhengdu had already explained the situation regarding living dead people to him over text. Because of this, when he personally laid eyes on Elder Chen, though he was still extremely stunned, he didn\u2019t freeze in place. He could still stutter out, \u201cDad.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d Elder Chen didn\u2019t notice his son\u2019s shock. He picked up the bag of greens and stood up, then ma.s.saged his waist. After, he released a sound of confusion and cheerily said, \u201cYo, I seem to be in great health today. My waist doesn\u2019t even hurt after sitting for so long.\u201dEveryone else: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dChen Xin gazed at his father. The old man\u2019s skin had already turned a purplish gray. There were also faint spots on it. He stood still in place, too scared to take a step forward.However, Yu Zhengdu could understand his hesitation. He said, \u201cMr. Chen, Elder Chen is fine. There\u2019s no need to be scared.\u201d\u201cWhat are you blankly standing there for? Come over and carry this stuff.\u201d Elder Chen took two steps forward and threw the groceries at his son. \u201cI bought these this afternoon in the market by f.u.xi. The vegetables you like best.\u201dHe smacked his lips together, slightly regretful. \u201cWhat a pity that I got delayed on the way back. They\u2019re not fresh anymore.\u201dChen Xin took the bag of greens from him, heart suddenly twinging in pain. The fear he felt regarding corpses instantly disappeared. He hurriedly walked forward and held onto Elder Chen. \u201cDad, let\u2019s go back.\u201d\u201cYes, yes.\u201d Elder Chen turned around and said goodbye to Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que, \u201cYoung men, I\u2019ve troubled you guys tonight.\u201d\u201cJust doing what we should\u2019ve done,\u201d Yu Zhengdu responded.\u201cThen I\u2019m leaving now,\u201d Elder Chen said with a smile. \u201cSee you again next time, if the chance comes up.\u201dYu Zhengdu smiled faintly too. \u201cIt definitely will.\u201dAfter saying this, he looked back at Chen Xin. \u201cMr. Chen, the following matters\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll tell him,\u201d Chen Xin said. Slight sorrow filled his gaze. \u201cI want to speak with him some more.\u201dYu Zhengdu nodded.Chen Xin helped his father into the pa.s.senger seat, then bade farewell to Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que.He didn\u2019t directly drive to the ancestral temple where Elder Chen\u2019s corpse was supposed to be. Instead, he slowly drove around in circles; while doing so, he conversed with his father. He chatted about when he had been a child, about Elder Chen\u2019s youth, and about his son \u2013 Elder Chen\u2019s grandson.Chen Xin was normally busy with work. During his rare days off, he usually stayed with his wife and kid. It had already been a long time since he had talked with his father like this. Previously, he had always felt like he didn\u2019t have anything to say to his father. He also felt like there would be time in the future to share a conversation. Elder Chen had pa.s.sed away very suddenly. While mourning, Chen Xin had also been in a rush to organize the funeral. He didn\u2019t have too much time to reminisce or feel regretful.But unexpectedly, this father and son pair would ultimately get another chance at a heartfelt conversation.It was only now that Chen Xin discovered that his father actually had so much to say. He incessantly recalled the events of his youth, excitedly relaying his past heroic deeds to his child; he spoke of stories about his son and grandson too. Minute details and trivial matters. Things the youth thought that the elder had already forgotten, but he actually remembered very clearly.\u201cEy, how come I\u2019ve suddenly become so talkative tonight?\u201d Elder Chen finally realized that something seemed off after rattling on for a long time.\u201cNothing, I just wanted to listen to you talk about the stories of the past.\u201d Chen Xin held back the sour feeling in his nose, doing his best not to make his voice sound choked up. \u201cThis is a rare opportunity, you know?\u201d\u201cEy, these are all boring old memories, nothing that needs to be mentioned.\u201d The old man waved his hands around. Though he said this, he couldn\u2019t hide his excited expression. Only a moment after, he started speaking again, \u201cSpeaking of, do you still remember when you were in elementary school\u2026\u2026\u201dThe father and son pair spoke like this for a long time. Elder Chen reminisced his entire life again and finally couldn\u2019t come up with another topic to talk about. Only now did he lean back against his seat, satisfied. \u201cI\u2019m really quite alert today. I don\u2019t even feel tired after speaking for so long\u2026\u2026\u201dAt this time, the sky was already starting to lighten up. From an unknown location, the crow of a rooster could be heard. This started Elder Chen back to his senses. In a daze, he asked his son, \u201cHow long have we been driving already? How come we aren\u2019t home yet?\u201dHe looked outside the car window, then couldn\u2019t help furrowing his eyebrows. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the way back home.\u201dHe turned back to look at his son. Only now did he discover that for some unknown reason, his son\u2019s face was covered in tears. Elder Chen\u2019s heart strangely twinged in pain. \u201cWhy are you crying?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d Chen Xin lowered his head and wiped away his tears. \u201cDad, we\u2019re here.\u201dElder Chen looked around, confused. \u201cHow come we\u2019ve come to the ancestral temple?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s talk about that when we go inside.\u201d Chen Xin forced down the sour feeling in his nose and helped the old mister slowly walk into the ancestral temple.Elder Chen\u2019s expression was bewildered. As he walked, he observed his surroundings and finally discovered that there were white lanterns hanging from the doors of the ancestral temple. There were also flower rings outside the doorway and yellow pieces of paper on the ground.\u201cWho pa.s.sed away?\u201d Elder Chen asked. At the same time, a few memories slowly came back. He sighed, \u201cWhy do I feel like I only visited this place a few days ago\u2026\u2026\u201dAt the same time, the two of them walked through the main doors of the ancestral temple.Because he was worried about scaring the others, Chen Xin had already notified his other family members to temporarily leave. Because of this, the entire ancestral temple was completely empty, causing it to appear a bit desolate.Elder Chen looked up, only to see that there was a familiar black and white photo placed atop the memorial tablet.\u201cEy, isn\u2019t that me?\u201d Elder Chen was stunned. He then looked at the placard next to the photo and discovered that his name was written on it.\u201cDad\u2014\u2014\u201d Chen Xin finally couldn\u2019t help shouting. His knees trembled and he knelt on the ground with a \u201cplop\u201d in front of Elder Chen.\u201cSo I was the one who pa.s.sed away.\u201d Elder Chen finally understood everything. Perhaps because of the heartfelt conversation he had shared with his son all night, he didn\u2019t feel any extreme regret right now. He reached out and stroked his son\u2019s hair. \u201cNo matter. At my age, I\u2019ve already lived enough.\u201dHe slowly walked up to the mortuary bed in the middle of the ancestral temple and laid down, then slowly closed his eyes. The last thing he said was, \u201cDon\u2019t be sad, my child.\u201dAfter Chen Xin picked Elder Chen up, Yu Zhengdu turned back to look at Shang Que. Very thoughtfully, he asked, \u201cBoss, do you want to go home by yourself or do you want me to send you home?\u201dShang Que: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe coldly turned around. \u201cI\u2019ll send you home.\u201dYu Zhengdu laughed to himself. As if nothing had happened, he followed behind the other. \u201c , thank you, Boss.\u201dThough the atmosphere between the two of them had finally started lightening up a little, in order to prove that he was still angry, Shang Que maintained an emotionless expression the entire way. He very stubbornly refused to speak to Yu Zhengdu.Yu Zhengdu also knew that he couldn\u2019t rush this process. Thus, he very cooperatively remained silent.After arriving at their destination, they needed to part ways. Yu Zhengdu finally said in embarra.s.sment, \u201cBoss, how about I go work at the subsidiary company for a few days?\u201dOtherwise, Shang Que would have to stay in his office all day without coming out again like he had done today.\u201cNo,\u201d Shang Que instantly rejected. He glanced at Yu Zhengdu out of the corner of his eye. \u201cYou must come to my office at least once a day.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Yu Zhengdu was surprised. \u201cYou\u2019re not mad at me anymore?\u201d\u201cOf course I am,\u201d Shang Que said. \u201cBut Peppa\u2019s fetal education mustn\u2019t be delayed. We can\u2019t let her know that her dads are fighting.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026???\u201d<b>The author has something to say:</b>Shang Que: Our familial cold war can\u2019t negatively impact the child.

However, as soon as he walked into Shang Que\u2019s office, he became shocked.Surprisingly, Shang Que was listening to Mozart in his office.Yu Zhengdu felt like he had been both physically and spiritually purified. In astonishment, he looked at Shang Que. \u201cBoss, since when did you start liking cla.s.sical music?\u201dShang Que, who diligently remembered that they were still in the midst of a cold war, coldly glanced at him. He made a gesture. \u201cThis is Peppa\u2019s fetal education music.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que\u2019s expression was full of fatherly responsibility. \u201cIt\u2019s important to start teaching them from young. I\u2019m going to ensure that Peppa becomes a goose who can escape the claws of poor taste.\u201dYu Zhengdu was speechless. He practically trembled while squatting down in front of the hatching nest. The big white duck \u2013 who was in the middle of hatching the egg \u2013 was very conscientious too. Upon noticing his arrival, she silently scooted her b.u.t.t away, revealing a little less than half of the egg.Yu Zhengdu reached a hand out and caressed the egg\u2019s sh.e.l.l. His gaze was full of pity for modern goslings.In order to avoid negatively affecting the natural hatching process, Yu Zhengdu stood up after stroking the egg a few times. As soon as he stood up, though, he became shocked once more.He stared at the computer screen, then turned to stare at Shang Que. His expression was extremely conflicted. \u201c\u2026\u2026Boss, don\u2019t you want to give Peppa a good fetal education environment? How come you\u2019re still gaming?\u201dAnd even opening three client servers at once.Shang Que\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change. \u201cI muted it. Peppa can\u2019t hear.\u201dYu Zhengdu couldn\u2019t help scanning the chat. \u201c\u2026\u2026You\u2019re even arguing with someone.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t turn my microphone on. If you don\u2019t say anything, Peppa won\u2019t know.\u201d Shang Que lowered his voice and said, completely justified.What else could Yu Zhengdu say? He obviously nodded with a smile on his face. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201dShang Que glanced at him once, then glanced at him again. A while later, he silently typed into the chat box:\u3010Rebound\u3011After, he closed the server and opened the company\u2019s financial reports.Yu Zhengdu chuckled before preparing to leave. \u201cThen I\u2019ll head out now.\u201d\u201cWait a moment,\u201d Shang Que stopped him.Yu Zhengdu: \u201c ?\u201dShang Que tapped on the time display on his phone screen. \u201cYou still have ten minutes of visiting time.\u201d\u2026\u2026Yu Zhengdu made a U-turn and sat across from Shang Que once more. \u201cThank you, Boss.\u201dAs soon as he sat down, he saw Shang Que pull a bag of takeout out from under the desk. \u201cEat breakfast.\u201dYu Zhengdu was slightly surprised. \u201cI still have the honor to eat your breakfast?\u201d\u201c This it this; that is that .\u201d Shang Que turned his head away, somewhat awkwardly stating, \u201cYou\u2019ll only have the energy to continue the cold war after eating.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dVery logical. Irrefutable.While eating breakfast, he scanned Shang Que out of his periphery. Shang Que\u2019s eyes were glued to his computer screen, but his inattention was obvious.Yu Zhengdu almost burst into laughter. Coincidentally, Shang Que secretly glanced over out of the corners of his eyes. Their gazes met.Yu Zhengdu: \u201ck2026;k2026;\u201dShang Que: \u201ck2026;k2026;\u201dThe atmosphere suddenly became a bit awkward.Shang Que\u2019s expression instantly became solemn. He leaned slightly back and crossed one leg over the other, posing elegantly. He lightly said, \u201cEat faster. You still have three minutes left.\u201dYu Zhengdu purposefully stated, \u201cIt\u2019s a bit hot. I can\u2019t eat so fast. How about I take it outside to eat?\u201dShang Que paused for a moment, then very generously offered, \u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019ll give you ten more minutes.\u201dThis time, Yu Zhengdu really couldn\u2019t resist the urge to burst into laughter. Then, he quickly apologized before Shang Que could throw a tantrum, tone sincere, \u201cBoss, I\u2019ve already reached a deep understanding about my mistakes. In order to express my regret\u2026\u2026\u201dHe pulled out his own phone and opened an app before handing the phone over. \u201cI made this last night. Please don\u2019t be angry anymore.\u201dShang Que glanced at the phone screen. It was surprisingly the homepage of the Ghost King changing game. His brows immediately furrowed. Just as he was about to take back the precious ten minutes he had extended to Yu Zhengdu, he saw Yu Zhengdu rapidly tap the \u201cchange\u201d b.u.t.ton; the closet items in the game became revealed.Shang Que froze. \u201c\u2026\u2026What\u2019s this?\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201cI replaced all the clothes in the game.\u201dOnly to see that the original two hundred-some women\u2019s outfits had disappeared from the closet. The new closet had been replaced with different versions and styles of men\u2019s outfits, such as exercise clothes, casual clothes, historical clothes, contemporary clothes, etc. Upon closer inspection, there was even a newly released haute couture outfit designed by a certain luxury brand.Yu Zhengdu clicked that outfit and changed the Ghost King into it. He softly said, \u201cI saw this on the fas.h.i.+on week trending topics list and thought that it would suit you, so copied it. I don\u2019t have the copyright license, which means you\u2019ll have to help me keep this secret. Don\u2019t leak the game to the general public, okay? Let\u2019s just secretly play amongst ourselves\u2026\u2026\u201dThe Ghost King in the game had a cold expression. He truly looked tall and handsome while wearing the newly released haute couture outfit. Though he was only 2D, he still appeared very extravagant. Yu Zhengdu praised from the bottom of his heart, \u201cAh, Boss looks really good wearing this. Much better than that celebrity who was walking on the runway in it.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Shang Que coldly watched as Yu Zhengdu changed his outfits. After a moment of hesitation, he finally grabbed the phone, quite reserved. \u201cLet me see.\u201dIn the next five minutes, Yu Zhengdu quietly sat in his seat and watched Shang Que furiously change himself.Yu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dUntil he noticed that Shang Que was actually starting to secretly take screenshots. He finally couldn\u2019t take it anymore and said, \u201cBoss, how about I download it onto your phone too. This is my phone\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que finally came back to his senses. He froze, but quickly returned to his aloof countenance. He handed the phone back to Yu Zhengdu and calmly said, \u201cDon\u2019t think that this matter is over just like this.\u201dYu Zhengdu accepted the phone and sighed to himself\u2026\u2026As expected, Boss was really hard to placate.The next second, Shang Que\u2019s phone appeared before him. \u201cDownload the game. I need to inspect it.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dBy the time he had finished downloading the game for Shang Que, Yu Zhengdu had also finished breakfast. He checked the time and conscientiously said, \u201cBoss, then I\u2019ll head back to work now.\u201dShang Que very casually opened the newly downloaded Ghost King changing game. Like usual, he coldly nodded. \u201c .\u201dAfter Yu Zhengdu stood up, Shang Que suddenly looked up at him again. \u201cYou made this last night?\u201dYu Zhengdu nodded.Shang Que temporarily fell silent. He was slightly displeased. \u201cIt was already so late when you got back last night. And then you stayed up longer?\u201dYu Zhengdu smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s unimportant.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be like this again in the future,\u201d Shang Que seriously stated. \u201cOtherwise, I\u2019ll get even angrier.\u201dDespite Shang Que\u2019s severe expression, Yu Zhengdu didn\u2019t feel the slightest bit unhappy in his heart. He only warmly replied, \u201cOkay.\u201dAs he walked out of the office, before he could close the door, he seemed to notice that Boss had suddenly revealed a\u2026\u2026strange smile? He didn\u2019t know if this was just an illusion or not.Yu Zhengdu had a slight premonition that something bad was going to happen.Half an hour later, his premonition came true.Lu Lingxi made an official announcement in the company\u2019s group chat. In order to give everyone a means of making up for their mistakes, and to create a harmonious, healthy work environment, Boss was requiring every employee to download the new version of the Ghost King outfit changing game. Additionally, the entire company was holding \u201cThe First Annual Luofeng CEO Appearance Design Contest\u201d; the contest was to last three days and Boss would personally be judging. The first three winners would get their monthly performances doubled, while the last three losers would be punished to clean the bathrooms for a month.The entire company: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAt the same time, Shang Que finally released Yu Zhengdu from his blocked users list on WeChat.My Broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010I think that there can be a few more shoe styles\u3011My Broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010Same for accessories\u3011Yu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu:\u3010I\u2019ll do my best to upgrade the version 0.0\u3011My Broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010Don\u2019t stay up late to do it\u3011My Broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010Also\u3011My Broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010You need to partic.i.p.ate too\u3011Yu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe following three days were the most serious and nerve-wracking three days at the company that Yu Zhengdu had witnessed since entering Luofeng. During breaks, no employees were casually chatting. All the ghosts were glued to their computers as they solemnly and seriously\u2026\u2026styled the Ghost King\u2019s clothes.\u2026\u2026Luofeng\u2019s only three living employees weren\u2019t excluded either.Zheng Yan had worked at Luofeng for a long time now. Additionally, as the product manager, he had previously already suffered through a bunch of Boss\u2019s crazy ideas. Thus, he didn\u2019t have too great of a reaction.Zhao Ruola felt like there was no joy left in life. She was in disbelief that she, a legendary Internet master who had given up on innumerous projects by investors willing to give her tens of millions, was actually required to partic.i.p.ate in Luofeng\u2019s 2D outfit styling contest.And her fellow compet.i.tors were a bunch of ghosts.She formally reminded Yu Zhengdu, \u201cDon\u2019t you ever tell anyone outside of this company that I\u2019ve partic.i.p.ated in such a compet.i.tion\u2026\u2026Oh, it\u2019d be best to simply not let anyone outside of this company know that our company held such a compet.i.tion. Prior to my death, I still need to go out and see people.\u201dYu Zhengdu gave her a deadpan look. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t need to go out and see people?\u201dThe two made eye contact. Their expressions were both sympathetic.Zhao Ruola complained, \u201cIt\u2019s all your fault. Why did you have to use Boss\u2019s face when making a stress relief game\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu was unimpressed as he retorted, \u201cWell you clearly had a lot of fun playing it earlier!\u201dIt needed to be known that Zhao Ruola was one of the few people who had owned the limited edition Cleopatra outfit.And she had earned it illegally through writing a cheat code.Zhao Ruola posed like the silly panda smoking , extremely regretful. \u201cThe temporary joy of changing outfits\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll be a permanent joy if you permanently change outfits,\u201d Yu Zhengdu comforted her. \u201cLook on the bright side. Your monthly performance is already so high. If you win the compet.i.tion, you\u2019d also be winning a large fortune.\u201d\u201cMakes sense!\u201d Zhao Ruola\u2019s eyes lit up. She seemed to have come back to life. She rubbed her hands together and said, \u201cWait for me to write a code that will automatically choose the best outfit pairs\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu was completely speechless. \u201cWriting another cheat code? Can\u2019t you have a sense of fair play at all?\u201dZhao Ruola gave a reasonable explanation: \u201cA compet.i.tion between technical skills is still a compet.i.tion!\u201dYu Zhengdu saluted, \u201cFarewell.\u201dActually, he wanted to simply write a cheat code and illegally compete as well. However, the next morning, when he visited Peppa for fetal education, Shang Que handed him two fas.h.i.+on magazines. \u201cFor reference.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dNevermind, it\u2019d be better to rely on his own skills. If Shang Que happened to find out about the cheat code, who knows what he\u2019d have to do to salvage their relations.h.i.+p.Thus, in the next three days, aside from working, Yu Zhengdu spent all his time trying his best to style the Ghost King using his programmer aesthetic.It could be said that the original intention for this minigame was stress relief. Now, though, it had become their entire company\u2019s greatest stressor.\u2026\u2026From a certain perspective, this technically satisfied their company\u2019s mission statement.Three days later, all of Luofeng\u2019s employees submitted their final masterpieces to Shang Que, right on the dot.Not even five minutes after submission, Shang Que revealed the results in their WeChat group:\u3010First place for this compet.i.tion: Yu Zhengdu\u3011Kang Jin:\u3010What about second and third place?\u3011Shang Que:\u3010What\u2019s the rush? I haven\u2019t looked over the outfits yet\u3011Group chat:\u3010\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u3011Kang Jin:\u3010Holy f.u.c.k. Boss didn\u2019t even look at anyone else\u2019s outfits but already decided on first place. Does he dare to be more obvious about how rigged this compet.i.tion is?!\u3011Once again, a minute of silence appeared in the group chat.Yu Zhengdu sent Kang Jin a private message:\u3010You switched to the wrong group chat again?\u3011Kang Jin:\u3010Aaaaaah, I\u2019m going to go unsend the message!\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010Too late.\u3011Official company group chat, Shang Que:\u3010You have a problem?\u3011Kang Jin:\u3010No!!\u3011Kang Jin:\u3010Good one, Boss!\u3011Kang Jin:\u3010I\u2019m going to clean the bathroom now. Goodbye, Boss!\u3011At the same time, Yu Zhengdu also received a private message from Shang Que.My Broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010Seeing as you won first for this compet.i.tion, I hereby announce that our cold war is over\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010\u2026\u2026Thank you, Boss\u3011<b>The author has something to say:</b>Shang Que: Principled ghosts must end cold wars in a principled manner.Zhengdu: Oh.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 84": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/New Times, New HellChapter 85 - Watching a MoviePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 85 - Watching a MovieThe First Annual Luofeng CEO Appearance Design Contest ultimately ended with Shang Que\u2019s proud and open rigging of the results.Zhao Ruola had originally been confidently awaiting her first place. She hadn\u2019t expected that her skills would ultimately lose to an under the table deal. Additionally, the program she had written to automatically pair clothing articles had too futuristic of an aesthetic. She unfortunately got eliminated.The employees at the company didn\u2019t dare to be displeased with Boss. They could only furiously message Yu Zhengdu in private.\u3010Tell me! What mesmerizing potion did you feed Boss!\u3011\u3010All you put on Boss was an average suit and shoes. And now you\u2019re the champion?!!\u3011\u3010Give me my doubled monthly performance back!\u3011In regards to these messages, Yu Zhengdu was extremely calm. He copy and pasted the same reply for all of them:\u3010Go complain to Boss\u3011Soon after, everyone shut up.After Shang Que unilaterally declared that the cold war was over, he very generously expressed that Yu Zhengdu could once again freely enter and exit his office.Yu Zhengdu: \u2026\u2026To be honest, he didn\u2019t feel like he had visited Shang Que\u2019s office any less during their cold war.Of course, he still had to pretend to be extremely surprised to Shang Que\u2019s face. Additionally, the fetal education time couldn\u2019t be forgotten either.As such, several more days pa.s.sed. This day, Yu Zhengdu was in the middle of writing code when Lu Lingxi came looking for him. She said that some employees at the Luofeng headquarters had told her that they hoped Luofeng could be like the companies of the mortal realm and occasionally organize some team building activities.Only now did Yu Zhengdu remember that since he had started working at Luofeng till now \u2013 which was quite a long time \u2013 aside from the garden party during the Ghost Festival, their company had seemingly never arranged any group activities. Previously, this had been because their company was very small and full of ghosts. Thus, he hadn\u2019t put much thought into this matter. Thinking about it now, ghosts had socializing needs too. Additionally, because of Shang Que\u2019s temper tantrum and the Ghost King costume changing compet.i.tion a few days ago, everyone was quite on edge. It was a pretty good idea to arrange for everyone to relax right now.Yu Zhengdu said, \u201cSounds good. You can go arrange it.\u201dLu Lingxi hesitated for a moment before finally sharing the true reason she had come looking for him. \u201cEveryone says that they don\u2019t want to continue visiting graveyards, rural areas, or other places like these anymore. Being a ghost is no fun. They want to go play in the mortal realm.\u201dYu Zhengdu hesitated. \u201cThat\u2019s against the rules, right?\u201dLu Lingxi lamented, \u201cYeah. Since the collapse of the Underworld, we\u2019ve borrowed a part of the mortal realm to take care of business, but there are too many rules. We can\u2019t do anything freely.\u201dYu Zhengdu understood everyone\u2019s thoughts too. Because of the fact that they couldn\u2019t disturb the order of mortal society, Underworld spirits had a very limited range of activities that they could do and that were safe. They also couldn\u2019t openly use the entertainment facilities of the mortal realm. Their daily lives truly were a bit boring.He thought about it and said, \u201cHow about this. We\u2019ll go buy out a midnight screening at the theater and watch a movie together.\u201dLu Lingxi\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cThat\u2019s a good idea.\u201dIf they bought out a screening, they could control the time and location to ensure that the mortals would all be sleeping. Doing as Yu Zhengdu said \u2013 buying out a midnight screening \u2013 basically wouldn\u2019t disturb the usual order of mortal society.An idea struck Lu Lingxi. \u201cI read on the news that there\u2019s a movie that just got released recently and has less than ideal ticket sales. The producers bought a lot of ghostly showings themselves. We can simply fill up those ghostly showings.\u201dYu Zhengdu looked at her, speechless. \u201cYou truly are an innovative talent in the field of saving money.\u201dLu Lingxi modestly said, \u201cI don\u2019t dare to be called a talent, but I really am a ghost .\u201dYu Zhengdu facepalmed. \u201cThose ghostly showings are only for ticket sales. The movie theater might not actually play the movie. There\u2019s no need to save money in this manner. Just buy out a screening normally.\u201d\u201cCTO is still the resolute one.\u201d Lu Lingxi gave him a thumbs-up. She asked again, \u201cThen, let\u2019s see. How about you go file the request with Boss for this activity, okay?\u201dYu Zhengdu side-eyed her. \u201cIf you need me to submit the request for such an activity, why does the company need you to be the HR manager?\u201dLu Lingxi answered very reasonably, \u201cBoss even forgave you after you used him as the main character of an outfit changing game. If you\u2019re the one who makes the request, Boss definitely won\u2019t deny it.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe actually had no response to that.Yu Zhengdu thought about it and stood up. He knocked on Shang Que\u2019s office door.Peppa\u2019s fetal education music had already changed from Mozart to Beethoven. Shang Que looked up and asked Yu Zhengdu, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dYu Zhengdu placed the name of the movie theater and the time of the showing that Lu Lingxi had already chosen out in front of Shang Que. He casually stated, \u201cI want to file a request to watch a movie with you.\u201dShang Que leaned his body slightly back. His expression was composed. \u201cI haven\u2019t decided whether or not I\u2019m going to allow that. Isn\u2019t it a little fast if we start dating now?\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu calmly stated, \u201cIt\u2019s a request for a company group activity.\u201dShang Que: \u201ck2026;k2026;\u201dShang Que\u2019s expression became disappointed at a speed visible to the naked eye. He offhandedly picked up the proposal Yu Zhengdu had handed over and very calmly stated, \u201cWhy are you randomly organizing a company group activity\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu smiled. \u201cIf Boss has the time, I also want to submit a request to watch a movie with you privately.\u201dThe corners of Shang Que\u2019s lips quirked up. \u201cAgreed.\u201dHis response was too fast. He only realized this after already answering. When he looked up, Yu Zhengdu was cheerily staring at him. Shang Que hurriedly put on a serious expression and added, \u201cI mean that I\u2019ve agreed to the company group activity. I still need to consider your private request.\u201d\u201cIs that so\u2026\u2026\u201d Yu Zhengdu dragged out his syllables and said, \u201cIf Boss is too busy, then nevermind.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019m not that busy these days.\u201d Shang Que actually pulled up his schedule and looked over it carefully. Then, he thoughtfully said, \u201c\u2026\u2026Free up your time this weekend, then. I\u2019ll see if those two days work.\u201dYu Zhengdu smiled, but didn\u2019t say anything.He had already guessed that Boss\u2019s \u201cconsider\u201d was probably referring to considering how to schedule his time.Luofeng\u2019s team building activity successfully came into being. All the ghosts in the company were very excited. It had been a long time since these Underworld spirits had been able to watch a movie on the big screen. Regarding this, they expressed extreme antic.i.p.ation.The night of the activity, all the ghosts headed towards the movie theater the showing was at under Lu Lingxi\u2019s direction. Because Zhao Ruola needed to take care of the elders at her home, she couldn\u2019t attend. Originally, after considering that it was more difficult for living humans to stay up late, Lu Lingxi also notified Zheng Yan that he didn\u2019t need to go. However, because the movie that they were going to see also happened to be one that Zheng Yan wanted to watch, and also because contemporary youths didn\u2019t fear staying up late, in the end, Zheng Yan still bravely tagged along.Prior to leaving, he didn\u2019t forget to bring along his mini eight trigrams mirror and bodhi bracelet.Yu Zhengdu watched as Zheng Yan rubbed his bracelet while walking. He couldn\u2019t help inquiring, \u201cDo you think it\u2019s appropriate to be bringing a bunch of ghost-removing tools with you to watch a movie with a group of ghosts?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going out in the middle of the night. What if we run into other ghosts?\u201d Zheng Yan asked very seriously. \u201cI\u2019m being prepared for all possibilities.\u201dYu Zhengdu scanned the Luofeng employees surrounding them. He, too, very seriously stated, \u201cI reckon that if there are other ghosts, they probably won\u2019t dare to appear.\u201dWhen they arrived at the movie theater, though, they discovered that their company of ghosts weren\u2019t the only people here to watch a movie. There were also quite a lot of humans. Yu Zhengdu glanced at the date and finally remembered that tomorrow was Friday. Coincidentally, a new movie was getting released at midnight tonight.Upon noticing this, Lu Lingxi hesitated for a bit. Yu Zhengdu waved his hand. \u201cEither way, we\u2019re in different auditoriums. It\u2019s not important. Just remind everyone to not go randomly visit any other showings.\u201dLu Lingxi nodded and started gathering the employees. As the representative, Yu Zhengdu needed to communicate with the movie theater\u2019s employee. The employee stared at Yu Zhengdu, then at Shang Que and Zheng Yan who were standing behind him. He was a bit surprised. \u201cThe three of you bought out a showing?\u201dIf they had bought out a showing in a small auditorium, that would\u2019ve been more reasonable. But they had bought out a showing in the largest auditorium in the movie theater. Additionally, they had told the movie theater to place popcorn and c.o.ke in the cupholders of all the seats in advance. The employees had all thought that this was an entire company coming to watch the movie. They had even been wondering what kind of company would buy out a midnight showing.He had never expected, in his wildest dreams, that only three men would appear.It would even be more reasonable if this was one man with two women or one woman with two men!Yu Zhengdu\u2019s expression remained unchanged. \u201cThe stubbornness of the wealthy.\u201dEmployee: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe employee confirmed the auditorium number with Yu Zhengdu, pondered for a bit, then informed, \u201cOh right. We\u2019ve been experiencing trivial technological difficulties recently. However, nothing too serious. If any situation happens while you\u2019re watching your film, all you have to do is shout for me.\u201dYu Zhengdu asked, \u201cWhat situation?\u201dThe employee hesitated for a moment before muttering, \u201cNothing too serious. Just, our system has recently fallen victim to a virus. These past few days, the midnight showings will sometimes be interrupted by part of a different movie halfway through. But the interruption isn\u2019t too long. Only a minute. It won\u2019t affect your viewing experience.\u201dYu Zhengdu instinctively felt like this employee\u2019s explanation was a bit illogical. However, this was the movie theater\u2019s problem. To them, as long as there was no effect on the viewing experience, things were fine. As such, he only smiled and said, \u201cOkay.\u201dAfter entering the auditorium, everyone conscientiously left the centermost seats \u2013 the best viewing location \u2013 for Shang Que. However, Shang Que didn\u2019t go sit there. Instead, he tugged Yu Zhengdu along and headed straight towards the corner-most seats of the last row.Their coworkers instantly felt greatly touched. \u201cI hadn\u2019t expected that Boss would be so kind. He actually left the best seats for the rest of us and is sitting in the corner now.\u201dShang Que was too lazy to listen in on what the others were saying. He pulled Yu Zhengdu down and glanced at him, satisfied. \u201cIf we\u2019re sitting here, it won\u2019t be too obvious when you want to scoot close to me.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThough Boss claimed to have never been in a relations.h.i.+p before, he had quite a deep understanding of these coquettish methods.The movie theater employee: \u2026\u2026The showing Luofeng had bought this time was a comedy that was pretty popular right now. Because everyone in the auditorium worked together, the atmosphere was quite relaxed, unlike usual, when they were very cautious at the movie theater. While watching, they quietly chatted with one another. Also because of the fact that their company had prepared popcorn and drinks for all of them, the atmosphere was very calm and peaceful.Shang Que propped one side of his face on his hand. While eating his popcorn, he watched the movie. He wasn\u2019t in a great mood.In only a moment, Yu Zhengdu discovered the other\u2019s glum mood. He nudged him with his arm and whispered, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Not happy?\u201dShang Que turned to look at him. He replied, softly as well, \u201cI was originally planning on watching this movie with you over the weekend. I hadn\u2019t expected that Lingxi would book this movie showing. She truly doesn\u2019t know how to make plans.\u201dYu Zhengdu burst into laughter. \u201cAren\u2019t you still considering? How come you\u2019ve already decided on a movie?\u201dShang Que\u2019s expression remained the same. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with being too prepared.\u201dYu Zhengdu pulled out his phone. He lowered the brightness and unlocked it. \u201cNo worries. We can choose a different movie right now.\u201dOnly now did joy appear in Shang Que\u2019s eyes. He scooted his head close. \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll choose a different one.\u201dTheir heads were next to each other. Shang Que could even feel Yu Zhengdu\u2019s breathing. The corners of his lips unconsciously quirked up. He thought about it and handed the large bucket of popcorn in his arms over. \u201cI\u2019ll share my popcorn with you.\u201dYu Zhengdu scanned the bucket of popcorn. He couldn\u2019t help reminding Shang Que, \u201cBoss, the popcorn we prepared was originally meant to be shared between two people.\u201dShang Que refused to admit defeat. \u201cn.o.body dares to share popcorn with me.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Boss was right.At the same time, the employee in charge of checking up on the auditorium glanced at the two people squished next to each other in the corner. Then, he glanced at Zheng Yan, who was sitting by himself in the middle of the room. His gaze was filled with sympathy: single dog, tragic.Shang Que grabbed a handful of popcorn and handed it to Yu Zhengdu. \u201cEat.\u201dYu Zhengdu was in the middle of reading through the reviews for other movies on his phone. Thus, he didn\u2019t look up. He simply ate the popcorn out of Shang Que\u2019s hand.A barely discernible smile appeared on Shang Que\u2019s face. He took a bite too and left a review in his heart,At this time, the screams of a crowd of people sounded out from outside the auditorium. The soundproofing of the movie theater was quite good, but those screams were honestly too loud. They actually managed to pierce through the wall and travel into their auditorium.Though the sound had already diminished greatly by the time it reached their ears, it was still easy to tell the horror in the screams. This caused all the ghosts present to turn around, slightly perplexed.Yu Zhengdu\u2019s gut was telling him something was wrong. Thus, he stood up and said, \u201cI\u2019ll look around outside.\u201dShang Que had originally been happily eating his popcorn. After being interrupted like this, his expression darkened. \u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201dThe two of them exited and walked down the hallway. There, they saw a few girls who had come to watch a movie standing in the hallway and wiping away their tears. Beside them, several movie theater employees were placating them. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, it was just a clip from a movie. It\u2019s not real\u2026\u2026\u201dOne of the girls among them broke down. \u201cI almost got scared to death. Don\u2019t you know to close the theater because of this problem?\u201dThe employee\u2019s expression was exasperated. \u201cWe\u2019re already trying to fix it. Also, I already warned everyone about this possibly happening in the beginning\u2026\u2026\u201dThe girl angrily yelled, \u201cYou guys didn\u2019t say that it was this kind of film!\u201dYu Zhengdu furrowed his brows and stepped forward to ask, \u201cMay I ask what happened?\u201dThat employee happened to be the one who had received Yu Zhengdu and them previously. As soon as he saw Yu Zhengdu, his expression became apologetic. He said, \u201cEy, just the situation I told you about earlier. It happened again just now. A segment of a different film started playing halfway through their movie\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu stared at the girl who was still trembling and asked, \u201cA segment from what kind of film?\u201dThe employee\u2019s eyes darted around. \u201cA horror film.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dEmployee: \u201cEy, we had no other choice either. The tech team investigated for several days, but couldn\u2019t get any results. This is such a large movie theater. We can\u2019t possibly halt business because of such a small error\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu\u2019s gaze became solemn. \u201cWhat\u2019s actually been going on?\u201dThe employee couldn\u2019t keep hiding things. Thus, he obediently told the truth.It turned out that starting from a few days ago, this movie theater\u2019s movies would suddenly start getting interrupted by part of a horror film at night. The rate of occurrence wasn\u2019t very high: the film would appear maybe once or twice every night. Sometimes, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily appear. It also wasn\u2019t very long, probably only half a minute or a minute in length. But because it was a horror film, it had a rather serious impact.The movie theater told the public that they were experiencing technical difficulties. The internal staff were also conducting investigations in this regard. However, after a few days of investigating, they still couldn\u2019t find the source of the error. That film was appearing randomly. The movie theater had no way of stopping it, but also couldn\u2019t close. They could only bite the bullet and continue business as usual.Yu Zhengdu felt like something was off as soon as he finished hearing the full story. \u201cYou guys really think this is a technical problem?\u201dAt this time, the movie theater\u2019s manager had walked over too. He happened to hear Yu Zhengdu\u2019s words. Consequently, his expression was a bit foul. \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201dYu Zhengdu didn\u2019t get annoyed, though. He only calmly stated, \u201cIf this was due to a viral infection, the conditions for its appearance would be much more random. Why do problems only occur at night?\u201dAs soon as he said this, the employee nearby\u2019s face suddenly turned white. His voice started trembling too. \u201cA-actually, we\u2019ve always thought that\u2026\u2026\u201dThe theater manager hurriedly stopped him. \u201cShut up. What bulls.h.i.+t are you spouting?\u201dYu Zhengdu didn\u2019t miss the guilt in the manager\u2019s eyes. Just as he was about to continue, abruptly, an ear-piercing screech sounded out from the auditorium they had rented. \u201cAaaah, there\u2019s a ghost\u2014\u2014\u201dIt was Zheng Yan\u2019s voice.Yu Zhengdu\u2019s gaze darkened. The employee nervously hit his own head. \u201cEy, it\u2019s definitely appeared in your auditorium as well.\u201dThey rapidly pushed open the door of the auditorium and walked in.Luofeng had bought out the largest auditorium in the movie theater. As soon as they walked in, they saw that the originally bright and colored comedy had disappeared from the screen. Instead, a depressing black and white replaced it.In the middle of the screen, a woman whose hair was completely down like Sadako was peeling an apple. She wore an ankle-length white dress and her hair hung in front of her face like a waterfall. It covered her face completely.Her hands were pale and withered, but her fingernails were bright red. She held a tiny knife and carefully peeled the apple skin off. While peeling, she slowly asked, \u201cDo you\u2026\u2026want to eat an apple?\u201d\u201cThe apples I peel are\u2026\u2026very delicious.\u201dThe employee hurriedly told Yu Zhengdu after hearing her words, \u201cEy, hurry and close your guys\u2019 eyes. After she finishes peeling the apple, she\u2019s going to part her hair.\u201dBut Yu Zhengdu didn\u2019t listen to the employee. Instead, he crossed his arms in front of his chest and expressionlessly stared at the movie screen with Shang Que.They could already tell that this movie theater wasn\u2019t experiencing any technical difficulties.The horror film on the screen was clearly a real female ghost.The female ghost had already finished peeling the apple. She slowly held her hand forward. \u201cCome, time to eat the apple\u2026\u2026\u201dThe employee became greatly agitated. \u201cEy, hurry and close your eyes! It\u2019s really scary when she parts her hair! Also, this horror film is 3D. She\u2019ll force the apple into your mouth!\u201dBut it was already too late. The female ghost laughed eerily and parted her hair like someone drawing open curtains, revealing her deathly pale skin. The skin of her face was cut open and her rotting tendons were faintly visible. Her eyes were terrifyingly large. Like two black holes, they sunk into her face. Her voice was also horrifyingly sharp. \u201cEat the apple\u2026\u2026\u201dEmployee: \u201cNo matter what you do, don\u2019t scream! I\u2019ve warned you!\u201dThe next second, the female ghost froze in place.From her perspective, she wasn\u2019t facing the usual auditorium full of humans.Instead, it was an auditorium full of ghosts.At this time, all the ghosts had one leg crossed over the other and were expressionlessly staring at her.Female ghost: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAaaah, so many ghosts!\u201d The female ghost tossed the apple away and held the apple-peeling knife in front of herself. She shrieked, \u201c Prosperity, democracy, civility, harmony, freedom, equality, justice, lawful \u2014\u2014\u201dStaff member: \u201c\u2026\u2026???\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThis female ghost had a really good understanding of the core socialist values!<b>The author has something to say:</b>Female ghost: Socialism, protect me!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The employee stared at the defensive position the female ghost was taking up with her knife. In a daze, he scratched his head and asked, \u201cYi? How come this clip\u2019s different?\u201dYu Zhengdu turned to look at them. Very meaningfully, he said, \u201cYou guys still think this is a film clip?\u201dBefore the employee could react, the manager\u2019s expression had already changed. He gazed at Yu Zhengdu, nervous. Hesitantly, he asked, \u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201dAt this time, an ear piercing shriek sounded from the middle of the auditorium. It was Zheng Yan. \u201cThere\u2019s a ghost in your movie theater! A ghost\u2014\u2014\u201dYu Zhengdu\u2019s mouth twitched. He stared at Zheng Yan, who was surrounded by all the ghosts in Luofeng, and really wanted to sayAt the same time, the female ghost on the screen also shouted, \u201cThere really are ghosts! He\u2019s not lying.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe employee belatedly understood. He wasn\u2019t as sharp-tongued as his manager. While screaming, he charged towards the door, \u201cAaah, we\u2019re being haunted! We\u2019re really being haunted\u2014\u2014\u201dWith a thud, the door to the auditorium suddenly shut.Yu Zhengdu glanced at Shang Que. In rare synchronization, Shang Que was faintly smiling at him. \u201cWe\u2019ll just resolve the incident here.\u201dYu Zhengdu nodded. Though everyone had an unspoken agreement about these matters, it was still better to not cause too much of a commotion. If the employee ran out while shouting, who knew how big of a mess this would cause in the neighboring auditoriums.The movie theater manager had originally wanted to keep calm. But as soon as he saw the door automatically close, he finally reached the end of his wits. Voice tight, he asked, \u201cW-who are you people?\u201dYu Zhengdu pulled out a business card and handed it to him. With a slight smile, he said, \u201ch.e.l.lo. This is covered in our company\u2019s scope of business.\u201dThe movie theater manager accepted the business card. He had just glanced at it when the employee next to him broke down and melted into a puddle on the floor. He furiously shook his head, \u201cWhat to do?! What to do\u2014\u2014We can\u2019t escape\u2014\u2014\u201dZheng Yan started adding to the commotion from the middle of the auditorium too. \u201cBoss, hurry and catch the ghost\u2014\u2014\u201dWith this interruption, the movie theater manager felt his brain go numb. He gulped and asked, \u201cYou need to prepare some tools, right? A sword made of the wood of a peach tree? The blood of a black dog?\u201dEmployee: \u201cWe can\u2019t even leave right now. How are we going to prepare anything?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no rush. We catch ghosts scientifically, so don\u2019t need that stuff,\u201d Yu Zhengdu placated.The manager had already lost his capability to think. \u201cWhat? Catching ghosts scientifically?\u201dOnly to see Yu Zhengdu step forward, extremely composed. He lifted his chin to gaze at the screen and calmly said, \u201cMiss Ghost, I\u2019m an employee at Luofeng. You\u2019ve already broken the rules of Underworld management. Right now, I\u2019m going to officially arrest you. Please immediately set down your weapon, place your hands on your head, and squat. We will be more lenient if you cooperate.\u201dThe employee couldn\u2019t help complaining, \u201cIs there something wrong with you? Do you think a ghost will pay attention to you if you\u2019re reasoning with them?\u201dAs soon as he finished speaking, he heard a . The female ghost on the screen threw her apple knife away and obediently covered her head with her hands. While facing one side of the screen, she squatted while crying, \u201cI only wanted to scare them a little. I didn\u2019t harm anyone, really\u2026\u2026\u201dEmployee: \u201c\u2026\u2026??\u201dManager of the movie theater: \u201c\u2026\u2026??\u201dThe manager stared at the big screen in shock. Then, he turned to look at Yu Zhengdu. \u201cW-what\u2019s going on?\u201dYu Zhengdu smiled faintly. \u201cOur company has a contract with the Underworld. Thus, all ghosts are rather\u2026\u2026respectful towards us.\u201dThe manager gazed blankly at him, then turned back around, bewildered, to observe the female ghost trembling on the screen. The question in his heart ultimately went unspoken\u2026\u2026The employee who was sitting on the ground was even more astonished. Without even bothering to wipe his tears away, he tried to speak. With difficulty, he asked, \u201cSo one can a-actually reason with ghosts?\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201cOur company can.\u201dThe ghost capturing ended abruptly, before the movie theater manager and employee could even mentally prepare themselves. When Yu Zhengdu pulled out handcuffs to arrest the female ghost, the movie theater employees couldn\u2019t even make any facial expressions because they were so shocked.Zheng Yan covered his chest with his eight trigrams mirror and said, still frightened, \u201cWhat did I say? As expected, it\u2019s very likely to encounter ghosts in the middle of the night. Good thing I brought tools that can ward off evil spirits!\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026Seems to me that they were useless even though you brought them.\u201dZheng Yan: \u201cHow could you say that? Didn\u2019t you see how that female ghost didn\u2019t even dare to step close to me?\u201dThe circle of Luofeng ghosts around him couldn\u2019t help turning to stare at him: \u2026\u2026Zheng Yan and the Luofeng employees continued watching their movie. Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que escorted the female ghost to an office in the theater. The movie theater employee and manager tagged along.Since the female ghost had stepped out of the screen, the humans in the movie theater could no longer see her. However, the next moment, they witnessed the power of new technology\u2014\u2014 Luofeng\u2019s ghost imaging technology.The employee immediately became respectful. \u201cTruly so scientific!\u201dAt this time, the movie theater manager finally shared the truth. In actuality, they had all felt that there was something off about the horror film clip incidents from early on. Though their company was adamant about saying that everything was only due to technical difficulties, in private, they had actually asked the maintenance technician for answers. The technician said that the company couldn\u2019t find any technical problems at all. The system didn\u2019t seem to be infected by a virus in the slightest.However, they absolutely could not publicize the fact that there was a probable haunting. If this news got out, there would be extremely detrimental consequences for the movie theater. As such, though the company was slightly suspicious, they still ordered the manager to keep the rumors under control, no matter how difficult it was to do so. Because of this, things got dragged out until now.The manager wiped the cold sweat off his forehead and said, \u201cActually, we were close to not being able to keep up the act. The audience members had many complaints. Originally, I was preparing to submit a request to the company within the next few days to have a religious master come by no matter what. I hadn\u2019t thought that I would encounter you guys. Truly so fortunate\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be so polite,\u201d Yu Zhengdu said with a smile. \u201cWe need to be paid too.\u201dThe manager was speechless. However, he still smiled politely. \u201cAs you should, as you should. I\u2019ll submit a request to the company tomorrow and have them refund the money you spent buying out the auditorium today.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not enough,\u201d Yu Zhengdu drawled out. \u201cI\u2019ll tell my coworkers at the finance department later to send our service fee to you.\u201dThe manager\u2019s expression appeared conflicted. \u201cI-I didn\u2019t submit a report ahead of time. The company might not approve the request\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que scanned him up and down before resting his gaze on the female ghost again. He coldly spoke, \u201cThen nevermind. Let her go.\u201dThe manager\u2019s expression immediately changed. He rapidly changed his mind, \u201cI\u2019ll definitely convince the company.\u201dBoth parties reached an initial stage of collaboration. Only now did Yu Zhengdu start interrogating the female ghost.He looked at the female ghost. Instead of yelling or trying to intimidate her, he calmly asked, \u201cSpeak. Why did you break the rules and come out to scare people?\u201dThe female ghost lifted her head and resentfully glared at the manager of the movie theater. Her tone was slightly angry too. \u201cThey and that stinkin\u2019 movie collaborated to have ghostly showings in order to fake ticket sales!\u201dAs soon as the female ghost said this, the manager\u2019s expression instantly became a bit unnatural. Yu Zhengdu recalled the recent news about a s.h.i.+tty movie creating fake ticket sales and glanced at the manager. \u201cSo your movie theater was the one having ghostly showings\u2026\u2026\u201dThe manager hadn\u2019t expected that this haunting had actually been caused by the ghostly showings. He felt extremely surprised and innocently proclaimed, \u201cOur company invested in that movie too. If the ticket sales are bad, we\u2019ll lose a lot of money\u2026\u2026 Also, the company required us to run the ghostly showings. We\u2019re only employees. We couldn\u2019t say no\u2026\u2026\u201dThe female ghost laughed eerily out of habit. \u201cSince they like running ghostly showings so much, I decided to make their movie theater become the setting of a real ghostly showing.\u201dYu Zhengdu was forced to tap on the table. He warned, \u201cWatch your att.i.tude. Quit acting like a ghost to scare people.\u201dThe female ghost hurriedly wiped her cold smile off and revealed a sweet, well-behaved grin instead. \u201cI know I was wrong.\u201dThe movie theater employee and manager both had bewildered expressions on.Though he now knew the cause of everything, Yu Zhengdu still lamented while staring at the female ghost, \u201cTheir ghostly showings weren\u2019t doing anything to you. You\u2019re a ghost. Where did your extreme sense of justice come from? You feel the need to take care of these types of situations too?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d The female ghost \u2019d. She angrily explained, \u201cThe lead actor of that s.h.i.+tty film is my gege\u2019s rival. A trashy actor acted in a trashy film and now needs fake ticket sales to compete against my gege. I obviously need to stand up for my gege\u2026\u2026\u201dThe movie theater employees suddenly felt their hearts almost stop beating.Yu Zhengdu almost exploded too.He had never expected, in his wildest dreams, that the reason for everything was the fury of a fangirl ghost.Due to the fact that the female ghost hadn\u2019t actually caused any true damage, according to Luofeng\u2019s rules, Yu Zhengdu ordered for her to be kept in custody for five days. She was also docked the corresponding amount from her good and evil scores. Thus, this incident became resolved. Of course, the movie theater didn\u2019t need to know about this part. They only needed to know that the female ghost would never appear again. This was so that they would pay the service fees on time.After dealing with the incident regarding the female ghost, the movie in the auditorium they had bought out had finished too. To express how apologetic he was, the manager of the movie theater gave Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que a free members.h.i.+p card to the theater. Yu Zhengdu didn\u2019t reject it. Coincidentally, he and Shang Que were going to watch another movie over the weekend. This made things a lot easier.Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que exited the office. All of Luofeng\u2019s ghosts were waiting outside.Yu Zhengdu laughed and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not like we don\u2019t know the way. You didn\u2019t need to wait for us.\u201dLu Lingxi waved offhandedly. \u201cThe neighboring premiere auditorium just happened to finish too. We\u2019re waiting around a bit in order to avoid encountering them.\u201dYu Zhengdu nodded, then scanned the crowd again. He realized that Zheng Yan was missing, so asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s Zheng Yan?\u201dLu Lingxi replied, \u201cHe went to the bathroom.\u201dAt this time, in the bathroom of the movie theater, a girl waited outside the door. She anxiously peeked her head into the female bathrooms and yelled at her friend, \u201cAh Qiao, hurry and come out. Almost everyone else has left already.\u201dThe girl named Ah Qiao replied, \u201cWhat\u2019s the rush? If everyone else is gone, we won\u2019t have to squeeze into the elevator anymore.\u201dThe girl said, \u201cI\u2019m so scared.\u201dAh Qiao scoffed. \u201cYou still haven\u2019t recovered?\u201dThe girl, expression dismal: \u201cNo s.h.i.+t. That female ghost stuffed the apple into my mouth. Hurry up.\u201dThis girl was named Anna. She happened to be one of the people scared by the female ghost during the premiere showing. After the incident, the movie theater employees had placated her for a long time and also reimbursed her for the movie ticket. Additionally, the movie premiering tonight was one she had waited a long time to watch. In the end, she still bit the bullet and stayed until the end of the premiere with her best friend, Ah Qiao.Originally, they had wanted to follow the large crowd of people leaving the premiere, but unexpectedly, Ah Qiao spent quite a long time in the bathroom. By now, everyone else had already left.Ah Qiao knew that her friend spooked easily too. She replied, \u201cOkay, okay. I\u2019m coming.\u201dAfter she finished speaking, the sound of the toilet flus.h.i.+ng sounded out from the male bathrooms next door. A man hurriedly ran out. While running, he shouted, \u201cWait for me, you guys! I\u2019m scared\u2014\u2014\u201dAnna: = =Just as she thought this, she noticed that something had fallen off of the man.\u201cHey, your thing fell\u2014\u2014\u201d Anna shouted. But the man had already shot off into the distance and disappeared. She was exasperated and could only pick up that item. She planned to turn it into the movie theater\u2019s lost and found later. However, she only realized after stepping closer to the item that the item was a string of prayer beads.Anna: = =Just as she was feeling speechless, Ah Qiao came out too. She glanced at the object in the other\u2019s hands and instantly felt shocked. \u201cWhen did you get infected with the middle-aged, greasy man aesthetic?\u201dAnna hurriedly waved her hands around . \u201cA man dropped this just now.\u201dAh Qiao: \u201c\u2026\u2026Tsk.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019ll turn it into the movie theater,\u201d Anna said. the two of them headed to the service counter.The front of the service counter was facing the elevator door. Ah Qiao noticed immediately that the elevator happened to be stopped on this floor. Thus, she hurriedly pressed the elevator b.u.t.ton to keep the doors open. She shouted, \u201cAnna, hurry and turn the thing in! I\u2019ll keep the elevator doors open.\u201d\u201cOh oh,\u201d Anna replied. She turned around to look and added, \u201cEy, the elevator\u2019s completely full. Let them go down first. We can wait for the next one.\u201dAh Qiao furrowed her brows. \u201cWhat are you saying? The elevator is clearly empty, okay?\u201dAnna: \u201cNo, it\u2019s really full. Look\u2026\u2026\u201dHalfway through her sentence, her heart suddenly fell to the bottom of her chest with a thud. The color on her face disappeared. In terror, she asked, \u201cAh Qiao, you\u2019re not joking with me, right?\u201d\u201cWhy would I joke with you? It really is empty\u2026\u2026\u201d While speaking, Ah Qiao turned around to look inside the elevator.While they had been speaking, Kang Jin had been furiously pressing the \u201cclose\u201d b.u.t.ton in the elevator. Finally, right before Ah Qiao turned around, he successfully managed to get the elevator doors to shut.With a \u201cding\u2014\u2014\u201d, the elevator started descending.Anna was on the brink of tears. She jogged over and said, voice trembling, \u201cAh Qiao, I really saw people in there earlier\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThen maybe I saw wrong?\u201d Ah Qiao was a bit uncertain too. She took the prayer beads out of Anna\u2019s hands. \u201cIt might be better if I\u2019m the one who turns this in. You wait right here for the elevator.\u201dAnna nodded. Ah Qiao happened to glance at the street outside the mall through the gla.s.s windows. With a smile, she said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be too worried. There are still a lot of people waiting outside. You won\u2019t die from fright.\u201dUpon hearing this, Anna looked outside too. She replied, \u201cThere aren\u2019t any people outside, though. They\u2019re clearly all gone, okay?\u201dAh Qiao said, \u201cWhat do you mean? They\u2019re even lining up\u2026\u2026\u201dAnna\u2019s face became terrified once more. Coincidentally, a male voice suddenly sounded out at this time. \u201cEy, aren\u2019t those my Bodhi prayer beads?\u201dThe next second, Zheng Yan s.n.a.t.c.hed his beads out of Ah Qiao\u2019s hands and smiled at the two of them. \u201cThank you guys. I thought I would never be able to find these again.\u201d\u201cThey are his.\u201d This man had a pale complexion and was quite handsome. Anna recognized him in an instant.Ah Qiao hurriedly let go and said, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201dZheng Yan put the prayer beads on, then pulled out a mini eight trigrams mirror to clutch onto. He finally sighed. \u201cNow I can rest at ease.\u201dAh Qiao and Anna silently took a step back.So greasy.\u201cLet\u2019s head downstairs together,\u201d Zheng Yan said. Coincidentally, the elevator stopped on this floor. Thus, Zheng Yan held the door open and gestured for the two girls to enter first.\u201cThank you,\u201d Anna replied. She walked in with Ah Qiao. After, Zheng Yan walked in too.After entering the elevator, Anna asked Zheng Yan out of curiosity, \u201cWeren\u2019t you telling your friends to wait for you? Where are your friends?\u201d\u201cDead,\u201d Zheng Yan replied. He maintained a calm smile on his face and acted like the other Luofeng employees standing in the elevator weren\u2019t there. It had to be said that his acting skills were quite believable.Anna: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShe made eye contact with Ah Qiao. They both a.s.sumed that Zheng Yan had been left behind by his friends so was now cursing them out of anger.Anna still felt a bit panicked in her heart. Through the clear elevator, she saw the streets outside. She pinched Ah Qiao. \u201cYou\u2019re too mean. You knew I was scared, but still lied and told me there were people outside\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThere really are, though.\u201d Ah Qiao peeked outside, then went in surprise. \u201cHow come they\u2019ve all disappeared?\u201d\u201cHahahaha.\u201d Zheng Yan suddenly started laughing really loudly from off to the side. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re all dead.\u201dAfter such an interruption, Anna and Ah Qiao both, again, went: = =However, because of this, they forgot to continue this topic of conversation.On the other side, the movie theater\u2019s manager had started supervising the final auditorium cleanups. A few employees dragged out several large bags filled with popcorn and drinks from the auditorium Luofeng had been occupying. One employee complained, \u201cThe people who rented this auditorium must be crazy. There were three of them, but they still asked for every seat to be filled with a bucket of popcorn. Even if you\u2019re rich, you can\u2019t waste money in this manner.\u201d\u201cLet them do whatever they want to. Don\u2019t comment so much,\u201d the manager scolded. He offhandedly picked up a bucket of popcorn from a seat nearby and grabbed a handful to throw into his mouth. \u201cIt would be nice to have more buyouts like this one\u2026\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish speaking, he spat a few times until the popcorn had all been removed from his mouth. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why is this popcorn\u2026\u2026\u201dHalfway through his sentence, he suddenly thought of something and hurriedly swallowed the second half of his sentence. The employee asked him in confusion, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the popcorn?\u201d\u201cNothing,\u201d the manager calmly stated. \u201cThe popcorn\u2019s gone soft.\u201d\u201cOf course it\u2019s gone soft. It\u2019s been sitting out here all night.\u201d The employee had thought that there was something actually wrong. Upon hearing this, he chuckled a few times and offhandedly plucked the popcorn out of the manager\u2019s hand to throw into the trash can. \u201cDon\u2019t eat it anymore.\u201dThe manager made a noise of acknowledgement. He didn\u2019t say anything else; only, he inconspicuously picked up a cup that hadn\u2019t yet been removed from the auditorium and took a sip. Then, he said, \u201cThese things have been left out for too long. Hurry and toss them out. Don\u2019t let anyone take anything home. If they end up with a stomach ache because of these foods, we won\u2019t be able to afford to compensate them.\u201dThe employee chortled. Without thinking too much, he said, \u201cWho would eat expired popcorn and c.o.ke?\u201dThe manager didn\u2019t respond. He only stared, face cold, as they worked. This was to prevent them from secretly consuming anything.At the same time, his thoughts started racing through his head.All the popcorn and drinks left in this auditorium had become flavorless. They tasted completely different from when they had first been made by the movie theater.Though the manager couldn\u2019t confirm that anything had truly happened, after considering the prior events, he more or less had a theory in his heart.His palms started sweating. He silently pulled out his phone and inputted the number on the business card Yu Zhengdu had left behind. Then, he texted the other.Manager:\u3010Great Master, did you guys specially come to help us out because you knew very early on that our movie theater was being haunted?\u3011Manager:\u3010Thank you guys so much!\u3011Manager:\u3010I\u2019m definitely going to diligently submit a request to the company in order to try and achieve a long term collaboration with your company!\u3011Yu Zhengdu after suddenly receiving these texts: \u201c\u2026\u2026??\u201dHe looked at Shang Que, bewildered. \u201cWhat\u2019s the movie theater manager saying?\u201dShang Que scanned the texts and very casually held onto Yu Zhengdu\u2019s hand while at it. He calmly said, \u201cNo matter. As long as he doesn\u2019t hold back on our service fees.\u201d\u201cOh,\u201d Yu Zhengdu replied. Then, he silently lowered his head and glanced at his wrist that was being held by Shang Que.Shang Que looked straight ahead. His expression didn\u2019t change. \u201cI can\u2019t always have you being the only proactive one.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d<b>The author has something to say:</b>Xiaokui: I need to take initiative too, occasionally.

The date progressed very smoothly. During the movie, Shang Que even held onto Yu Zhengdu\u2019s hand again because he believed \u201che couldn\u2019t always have the other be the proactive one.\u201dAfter exiting the movie, Shang Que appeared very pleased. He generously praised, \u201c , this movie wasn\u2019t bad.\u201d\u201cIt was pretty good,\u201d Yu Zhengdu nodded. \u201cHowever, it was slightly annoying during the middle of the movie when the male lead was determined to rescue the other person himself. Such individualistic behavior really makes me want to hit someone\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Shang Que glanced at him, bewildered. \u201cWas that part of the plot?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Yu Zhengdu fell silent for a moment. \u201cThe female lead even got taken away because of that, right?\u201dShang Que carefully recalled the movie before holding his hands out in exasperation. \u201cI forgot.\u201dYu Zhengdu was speechless as he stared at Shang Que. \u201cThen when you said the movie wasn\u2019t bad, you meant\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThat it wasn\u2019t bad.\u201d Shang Que looked at Yu Zhengdu. There was inconcealable delight in his eyes. He confidently asked, \u201cIs there a conflict between me saying the movie wasn\u2019t bad and me saying that I can\u2019t remember the plot?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Yu Zhengdu couldn\u2019t help laughing too after seeing the amus.e.m.e.nt in Shang Que\u2019s gaze. \u201cYou\u2019re right. The movie was truly not bad.\u201d\u201cWait, no. You remember the plot so clearly.\u201d Shang Que suddenly thought of something. He furrowed his brows and looked at the other. \u201cYou were actually diligently watching the movie during our first movie date?\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u2026\u2026Yu Zhengdu immediately denied this. \u201cBulls.h.i.+t. Of course I wasn\u2019t diligently watching the movie. I forgot the plot completely too.\u201dShang Que had no response for this. He belatedly realized that he had exposed something about himself. Slightly unnaturally, he turned to look in a different direction. \u201cI did diligently watch the movie just now.\u201dAfter brief thought, he added in embarra.s.sment, \u201cI\u2019m also not unhappy.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Yu Zhengdu\u2019s eyes crinkled into crescents unconsciously. He patted the back of the other\u2019s hand. \u201cLet\u2019s go eat.\u201dHe pulled out his phone. \u201cLet me see what\u2019s good to eat around here\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI already looked that up.\u201d Shang Que\u2019s good mood instantly returned. \u201cThere\u2019s an Internet-famous restaurant in this mall. I already reserved spots in advance.\u201dYu Zhengdu\u2019s hand paused in the middle of scrolling. He suddenly remembered his trip to Diyang with Shang Que previously \u2013 Shang Que had also excitedly looked up an Internet-famous restaurant and taken him there to eat. Back then, he had actually thought that Shang Que merely wanted to visit a famous restaurant. He had even invited the kinnaras out to eat too.No wonder Shang Que had been so depressed at the time.\u201cOkay.\u201d Yu Zhengdu stuffed his phone back into his pocket. With a smile, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re in charge.\u201dAs expected, the restaurant Shang Que had chosen was in a style that was very suitable for couples. The food was actually just average, but the benefit was that the environment was great.Fortunately, the two of them weren\u2019t actually invested in the food. While eating, Shang Que had already started imagining their next date. \u201cI thought today\u2019s itinerary was very good. In the future, we can come out together more often\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu couldn\u2019t help purposefully teasing him, \u201cWeren\u2019t you still considering? If you happen to reject me, how will we come out together more often?\u201d\u201cUm\u2014\u2014\u201d Shang Que actually started hesitating because of Yu Zhengdu\u2019s question. A long time later, he suddenly came to a realization. He looked up at Yu Zhengdu. \u201cIf you\u2019re in a rush, you can tell me in advance. Then, I can give you an answer in advance.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu faintly smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not in a rush.\u201d\u201c , there\u2019s no need to be in a rush.\u201d Shang Que softly coughed. He turned his face away. \u201cEither way, I\u2019ll wait for you.\u201dShang Que\u2019s side profile was very sharp and angular. It carried a slight coldness that was unique to those used to being in high positions. However, his tone was very calm and normal. It was so calm that Yu Zhengdu unexpectedly felt somewhat touched.Yu Zhengdu didn\u2019t continue teasing him. He solemnly replied, \u201cOkay.\u201dThe two continued eating and chatting about day to day matters. They were usually extremely busy with work and taking care of various emergencies; they had never sat down like this, with no business to attend to and no unprecedented situation to deal with, and shared an ordinary conversation before. Now that they finally had, they suddenly discovered that they had actually already experienced so many different things together.What was even more unique, the things they had experienced together hadn\u2019t always been good, but they had all ended relatively happily.In hindsight, Yu Zhengdu realized that even though he often encountered unexpected emergencies, it had been a long time since he had felt nervous or worried about them. Thinking carefully, he understood that this was largely because he knew Shang Que would always be right by his side.It was already impossible to trace this subconscious trust and reliance back to its origins. But obviously, these emotions had developed far earlier than he had realized.\u201cXiao Shang,\u201d Yu Zhengdu suddenly called out.Shang Que looked over.Yu Zhengdu smiled. \u201cYou have to wait for me.\u201d\u201cI am.\u201d Shang Que\u2019s face was slightly stiff. He did his best to make sure that a slight smile wouldn\u2019t ruin his cold aura. \u201cI won\u2019t run off.\u201dA meal pa.s.sed in this warm atmosphere. Yu Zhengdu saw that it was about time, so prepared to suggest paying for the bill and leaving. Out of the blue, a familiar female voice sounded out from nearby. \u201cEy, Zhengdu, what a coincidence. You\u2019re here too?\u201dYu Zhengdu turned to look. It was his college cla.s.smate, Zhang Qingqing. Zhang Qingqing was holding onto a man\u2019s arm. She cheerily walked over. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen you.\u201d\u201cIt truly has.\u201d Yu Zhengdu stood up and greeted her. He glanced at the man next to her. \u201cOn a date with your boyfriend?\u201d\u201cYeah. We just got together. He\u2019s my coworker,\u201d Zhang Qingqing brightly introduced. Then, she looked at Shang Que and blurted out, \u201cHuh, you\u2019re on a date too?\u201dOnly after asking this did she realize that the two of them were both men. Publicly teasing them didn\u2019t seem too appropriate. Zhang Qingqing hurriedly apologized, \u201cSorry, I was joking.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Yu Zhengdu waved his hands and generously admitted too, \u201cWe are on a date.\u201dShang Que had originally been worried that Yu Zhengdu would feel awkward. He hadn\u2019t expected that he would actually admit this fact so carefreely. A slightly pleased smile appeared on his face. He nodded as well. \u201c .\u201dTheir openness allowed Zhang Qingqing to heave a sigh of relief. Thereafter, she couldn\u2019t help raising an eyebrow suggestively at Yu Zhengdu. \u201cPreviously, you never replied when everyone else spoke about this matter in the group chat. I thought that the news was wrong.\u201dYu Zhengdu smiled, but didn\u2019t respond. Either way, there was no way to clear things up regarding this mess. Fortunately, he probably wouldn\u2019t need to clear things up anyways.Zhang Qingqing\u2019s boyfriend revealed a shocked expression. \u201cSo you guys are a couple?\u201d\u201cNot right now,\u201d Shang Que very solemnly replied.Zhang Qingqing and her boyfriend were both bewildered. In confusion, Zhang Qingqing asked, \u201cWhat does \u2018not right now\u2019 mean?\u201d\u201cThe literal meaning.\u201d Yu Zhengdu wasn\u2019t planning on going into too much detail to explain their situation to outsiders. He only vaguely answered, \u201cWe haven\u2019t officially started dating yet, so we\u2019re not technically a couple.\u201dZhang Qingqing only got a slight gist of things, but also couldn\u2019t ask for more details. Instead, her boyfriend dumbly scratched his head and said, \u201cOh, so you\u2019re not a couple.\u201dZhang Qingqing: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe comprehension skills of a straight man were the most lethal.Both parties were here on dates. Thus, they didn\u2019t converse for too long. After greeting Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que, Zhang Qingqing and her boyfriend left for their own table. However, they had only taken a few steps away when two girls from nearby pushed each other towards Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que.\u201ch.e.l.lo, you two handsome guys.\u201d A girl stared at Yu Zhengdu, face flushed red. \u201cCan we ask you to help us out with something?\u201dYu Zhengdu was confused. \u201cWhat?\u201dThat girl made eye contact with her friend before shyly saying, \u201cThis is the situation: the restaurant is holding a promotional event today, right? As long as a couple takes a picture in this restaurant and leaves it here as a souvenir, they\u2019ll get a discount and will also be entered into a raffle. Thus, we thought\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu had an idea of what was going on immediately after hearing this. People had hit on him innumerous times throughout his life. He had witnessed various different methods for striking up conversation. It was very likely that these two girls wanted him and Shang Que to pretend to be their boyfriends and go take the couple picture. Then, they could smoothly transition into asking for Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que\u2019s WeChat ID\u2019s or other contact information.Fortunately, Yu Zhengdu was someone who had remained single because of his prowess for over twenty years. He had immediately come up with an excuse to reject them. Just as he was about to speak, he heard Shang Que ask from beside him, interest piqued, \u201cCouple photos will enter us into a raffle?\u201dThat girl noticed that he seemed very fascinated. The shyness on her face immediately became replaced by a smile. \u201cYes. At the front counter.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s go take that photo.\u201d Shang Que grabbed Yu Zhengdu\u2019s hand and headed straight for the front counter. He didn\u2019t forget to turn around and thank the two girls, \u201cThank you for telling us about this promotional event.\u201dThe two girls: \u201c\u2026\u2026???\u201dYu Zhengdu was speechless too.Very good. He was single because of his prowess; Shang Que was single because of his natural talent. From a certain perspective, they were truly a match made in heaven.Zhang Qingqing and her boyfriend who had just taken a few steps away and who were still in hearing distance: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHer boyfriend asked, expression bewildered, \u201cDidn\u2019t they just say that they aren\u2019t a couple? Why would they still go partic.i.p.ate in the couple\u2019s photo activity?\u201dMonday at work, Yu Zhengdu headed to Shang Que\u2019s office first thing in the morning, as usual, for Peppa\u2019s fetal education.These past few days, Shang Que had been in a great mood. Yu Zhengdu squatted beside him in front of the nest and listened to him read a poem to Peppa: \u201c Goose goose goose; Neck bent towards the sky in song; White feathers floating above the emerald water; Red feet pus.h.i.+ng through clear waves .\u201dAfter reading the poem, Shang Que couldn\u2019t help lamenting, \u201cIt\u2019s a pity that the swimming pools in the city most likely won\u2019t allow a goose to enter the water. Otherwise, Peppa could definitely become a young champion swimmer.\u201dYu Zhengdu solemnly stated, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a need to fight for that champions.h.i.+p t.i.tle.\u201dJust as they were speaking, Lu Lingxi walked in too. She said, \u201cBoss, you previously said that you were going to give everyone a day off. The date you mentioned is almost here. I\u2019m here to confirm with you again that you\u2019re really going to give everyone a holiday?\u201dShang Que scanned Yu Zhengdu out of his periphery and softly coughed. \u201c , I am.\u201d\u201cExcellent. I\u2019ll go tell everyone.\u201d Lu Lingxi exited the office, delighted.Only now did Shang Que turn to look at Yu Zhengdu. He slowly stated, \u201cYou know. It doesn\u2019t have to be too extravagant. As long as I can tell your intentions.\u201dYu Zhengdu burst into laughter. \u201cOh.\u201dShang Que paused for a moment and inquired, \u201cDo you need my help preparing anything?\u201dYu Zhengdu couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cWhat do you want to prepare?\u201d\u201cI read a guide online,\u201d Shang Que replied. \u201cIf you need me to, I can help you choose a location\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cGot it. I\u2019ll make a careful decision.\u201d Yu Zhengdu smiled slightly while facepalming. \u201cI\u2019ll head off to work now.\u201dA while after Yu Zhengdu had left the office, Shang Que was still in the midst of diligently considering which location was best suited for a confession. Until the \u201cbuzz buzz\u201d of WeChat interrupted his thoughts.Shang Que glanced over. It was the phone Yu Zhengdu had forgotten to take with him.Thus, he decided to return the phone to Yu Zhengdu. Just as he picked it up, several consecutive messages popped up on the screen.Qin Yuejian:\u3010Speaking of, who\u2019s the male friend who likes you?\u3011Qin Yuejian:\u3010Have you confessed to him that you don\u2019t like men yet?\u3011Qin Yuejian:\u3010Straight men rejecting gay men is really very worrisome\u3011Qin Yuejian:\u3010And you\u2019re good friends too. Such bad luck\u3011Qin Yuejian:\u3010How about you just accept his advances\u3011Shang Que gazed at these messages. He instinctively thought of something. A disbelieving expression slowly appeared on his face.Shortly after, the office door got opened again. Yu Zhengdu walked in. \u201cBoss, did I leave my phone in your office?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Shang Que lifted his head. He pointed at the phone on his desk. He looked bewildered. \u201cJust now, Qin Yuejian sent you a few messages. I accidentally saw them.\u201d\u201cOh, not a big deal,\u201d Yu Zhengdu said. Then, he picked up his phone and looked at the messages: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOnly to hear Shang Que slowly ask, \u201cIs the male friend he\u2019s talking about\u2026\u2026me?\u201dYu Zhengdu hadn\u2019t expected that everything would get exposed in this manner. He looked up and saw that Shang Que\u2019s face was blank. It seemed like he didn\u2019t know how to respond.Yu Zhengdu felt a bit uncomfortable in his heart. He sighed, \u201cYes.\u201dShang Que\u2019s expression instantly became indescribable. \u201cCould it be\u2026\u2026that I misunderstood?\u201dYu Zhengdu decided to just reveal the whole truth. He nodded, \u201cYes.\u201dShang Que: \u201cSo\u2026\u2026you\u2019re not actually planning on confessing?\u201dYu Zhengdu didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. \u201cI never said that I was going to confess.\u201dShang Que had no response to give.Finally, he was forced to reconsider all the events in his memories.And then, he couldn\u2019t help realizing\u2026\u2026It seemed that Yu Zhengdu had truly never said that he would confess to him.All those things that he had once thought were part of the plot of their romance suddenly had new explanations.The dazed reaction from Yu Zhengdu each time. The eventual moments where the other had desired to speak but ultimately hadn\u2019t.Everything, from the start, had never been the way he had a.s.sumed.This shocking discovery caused Shang Que great surprise. He looked up at Yu Zhengdu.\u201cHowever\u2026\u2026\u201d Yu Zhengdu stared back at him. He gently placated, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal. I finally understood too\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt is no big deal.\u201d Shang Que stiffly turned his head to the side and forced himself to appear nonchalant. \u201cEither way, even from the beginning, I was never planning on agreeing.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d<b>The author has something to say:</b>Xiaokui: I wasn\u2019t planning on agreeing (stubborn)Zhengdu: \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Okay.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He suddenly burst into laughter: he actually didn\u2019t know how to respond.Shang Que turned to the side and lifted his chin, making himself appear elegant and proud.He waited a bit, but Yu Zhengdu remained silent. Thus, he couldn\u2019t help glancing at Yu Zhengdu out of his peripheral vision.Coincidentally, Yu Zhengdu happened to be looking at him too. Their eyes met. Yu Zhengdu\u2019s gaze softened. \u201cBoss, hear me out\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI refuse.\u201d Shang Que decided to get the first word in. Very confidently, he said, \u201cYou were the one who misunderstood. Even from the beginning, I wasn\u2019t planning on agreeing.\u201dThough he managed to control his facial expressions while saying this, his hand subconsciously gripped the computer mouse harder. His knuckles had even started turning white.Yu Zhengdu got refuted before he had even managed to say anything. Eyes bright, he stared at Shang Que. A moment later, he finally sighed heavily and spoke again, \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely sure that you weren\u2019t planning on agreeing?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d Shang Que replied. His tone was harsh, carrying with it the arrogance that was in his bones. \u201cEither way, didn\u2019t you say that you were never planning on confessing to me? We\u2019re even!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re even .\u201d Yu Zhengdu kept his gaze on Shang Que. An unknown thought struck his mind. Without realizing it, he had already revealed a slight smile. \u201cI thought about it, though, and realized that it wouldn\u2019t be bad if you agreed.\u201dShang Que furrowed his brows. He temporarily couldn\u2019t understand what Yu Zhengdu\u2019s words meant.\u201cHowever, I feel like I truly need to carefully reconsider.\u201d Yu Zhengdu stuffed his hands into his pockets and seriously asked, \u201cDo you actually want to be with me, or do you only want to be with me because you think I like you?\u201dShang Que coldly rebuked, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be with you\u2026\u2026\u201dHalfway through this phrase, he noticed that Yu Zhengdu was staring straight at him. Shang Que instinctively paused and swallowed the second half of his sentence. He said instead, \u201cYou don\u2019t like me anyways.\u201d\u201cI never said anything of the sort,\u201d Yu Zhengdu replied with a smile. \u201cXiao Shang, you can\u2019t a.s.sume that I like you, then a.s.sume that I don\u2019t like you.\u201d\u201cMore importantly, you can\u2019t want to be with me because you think I like you, then change your mind when you think I don\u2019t like you.\u201dShang Que\u2019s mind had already gone blank. He couldn\u2019t understand what Yu Zhengdu was saying at all. He only stubbornly retorted, as usual, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying.\u201d\u201cThen carefully think about it,\u201d Yu Zhengdu stated very patiently. \u201cI\u2019m not in a rush.\u201dShang Que inhaled deeply. He pulled up the game server on his computer screen and expressionlessly ordered Yu Zhengdu to leave. \u201cYou can leave. I\u2019m gaming.\u201d\u201c , I\u2019ll temporarily work at the subsidiary company over the next few days,\u201d Yu Zhengdu said. He retreated to the doorway of the office, thought about it, and turned back around. With a smile, he shouted out, \u201cXiao Shang.\u201dShang Que looked up.Yu Zhengdu\u2019s eyes crinkled up. Cheerily, he said, \u201cYou look great.\u201dShang Que: !!!!The next morning, Yu Zhengdu clocked in at the subsidiary company, Amazing Future. Usually, he travelled between the headquarters and subsidiary company quite often. Thus, his coworkers didn\u2019t think anything was off.Yu Zhengdu didn\u2019t explain anything either. After sitting down, he pondered a bit and sent Shang Que a message:\u3010Do you need me to go help with Peppa\u2019s fetal education today?\u3011This time, Shang Que hadn\u2019t blocked him. However, he didn\u2019t respond either.Yu Zhengdu fell deep into thought.Coincidentally, a programmer at the subsidiary company, Liu Wei, came over to discuss a problem with him. Thus, Yu Zhengdu pushed the situation with Shang Que to the back of his mind. He started a.n.a.lyzing the problem with Liu Wei.Halfway through, a shadow appeared beside them. The surrounding programmers all greeted, \u201ch.e.l.lo, Boss Shang.\u201dYu Zhengdu looked up, only to see Shang Que standing right in front of him. The other was staring down at him, expression cold and severe.At this time, Liu Wei turned around too. His entire being was shocked. His voice cracked as he shouted, \u201cBoss Shang, why are you carrying a chicken nest?\u201dExactly right. Shang Que was currently dressed in a tailored suit, looking as elegant and fine as always. He was also standing straight up, his perfect posture making him appear handsome and graceful. The authority of a superior emanated off his person.However, in the hands of such a refined and serious Boss Shang was an enormous\u2026\u2026chicken nest?Not only so, but if one looked down, they would realize that there was also a white duck by his feet.Liu Wei\u2019s entire being was bewildered. \u201cBoss Shang, our company isn\u2019t about to expand into animal husbandry, right?\u201dTheir company\u2019s list of products was already weird enoughk2026;k2026;Yu Zhengdu was staring at the object in Shang Que\u2019s hands too. That was clearly Peppa\u2019s hatching nest. However, he didn\u2019t know what Shang Que was preparing to do.He stood up and told Liu Wei, \u201cHead back to your seat first. Come back later\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need. I\u2019ll be leaving after setting this stuff down,\u201d Shang Que calmly said. Then, he coldly took two steps forward and placed that giant chicken egg on Yu Zhengdu\u2019s desk. Following this, he lowered his gaze and glared at the big white duck.The big white duck went \u201cga\u2014\u2014\u201d and flew onto the office desk. Then, she wriggled her duck b.u.t.t and sat right in the middle of the nest to continue hatching the egg.Fortunately, Yu Zhengdu\u2019s desk was big enough; it barely managed to fit this nest and duck.Yu Zhengdu turned to look at Shang Que, slightly confused. His heart suddenly twinged in discomfort. Could it be that Shang Que had been\u2026\u2026completely heartbroken? He didn\u2019t want his daughter anymore either?He hesitated for a moment before tentatively asking, \u201cBoss, you\u2019re\u2026\u2026?\u201dShang Que didn\u2019t make eye contact with him. Instead, he turned his head away and kept a hand in his pocket. He stared off into the distance and, using a nonchalant tone, answered, \u201cI thought that if we weren\u2019t together, Peppa would probably want to follow you around more.\u201dA row of question marks appeared over Yu Zhengdu\u2019s head. He almost did a spit-take on the spot.Wait no. Could the act Shang Que be putting on right now be\u2026\u2026part of the plotline regarding a battle for custody following divorce?Yu Zhengdu became temporarily bewildered. Should he say, ?Though Shang Que swore that he had never planned on agreeing, from dating to raising a child, from raising a child to divorce, their entire romantic plotline was extremely complete. Not even one plot hole existed.\u201cI hope that you will be able to bear the responsibility of being a single father,\u201d Shang Que continued. \u201cDon\u2019t ignore our daughter because I\u2019m no longer by your side.\u201dA mouthful of blood was stuck in Yu Zhengdu\u2019s throat. He almost choked to death. A long time later, he facepalmed and said, \u201cGot it. I\u2019ll take good care of Peppa.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry either. I\u2019ve set up a protective field around Peppa. Prior to her birth, nothing will happen,\u201d Shang Que added. He glanced at the big white duck again, gaze sharp. \u201cYou know what to do, right?\u201dThe big white duck tucked its wings in and lowly quacked.After giving his orders, Shang Que finally nodded with satisfaction. He glanced at Yu Zhengdu and softly coughed. \u201cI\u2019ll be leaving now.\u201d\u201c .\u201d Yu Zhengdu nodded, \u201cTake your time.\u201dShang Que stood in place, unmoving. A pause later, Yu Zhengdu couldn\u2019t help staring at him in confusion: \u201c?\u201dShang Que casually scanned his surroundings before calmly speaking up again. \u201cDon\u2019t you have any work related things to report to me?\u201d\u201cNot yet.\u201d Yu Zhengdu smiled and looked at him. \u201cWhen I do, I\u2019ll send them to you over WeChat.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to be concise over the Internet,\u201d Shang Que said. \u201cIt\u2019d be better to come discuss in my office if you have questions.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201cOkay.\u201dShang Que waited a moment more. Upon realizing that the other truly had nothing else to say, he could only turn away. \u201cThen I\u2019ll leave now.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c .\u201dAs such, Shang Que took a step forward with his long, straight legs and elegantly prepared to leave. Merely two steps later, he thought of something else. He stopped and turned around to say, \u201cEven though Peppa is staying with you, I still have the right to come see her, I a.s.sume?\u201dYu Zhengdu faintly smiled. \u201cOf course.\u201dShang Que nodded. \u201cThen I\u2019ll still come regularly for her fetal education.\u201dYu Zhengdu couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cBy \u2018regularly,\u2019 you mean?\u201dShang Que lowly said, \u201cJust once a day.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u2026\u2026After reaching an agreement on his visiting schedule for his daughter, Shang Que finally left, satisfied.Yu Zhengdu couldn\u2019t help facepalming once again. As soon as he turned around, he noticed Liu Wei staring at him, perplexed. \u201cLeader, why did Boss Shang give you a chicken nest?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not a chicken nest,\u201d Yu Zhengdu said. \u201cThat\u2019s a breeding nest. We\u2019re hatching an egg.\u201d\u201cAh, is that so\u2026\u2026\u201d Liu Wei scratched his head. He turned to look at the breeding nest and became bewildered once more. \u201cWait a minute. Leader, if you\u2019re hatching an egg? Why is there a duck in here?\u201dYu Zhengdu was too embarra.s.sed to say that it was because geese were so aggressive, even ghosts couldn\u2019t catch them. Thus, he vaguely asked, \u201cIs there a problem?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Liu Wei\u2019s entire being was lost. \u201cLeader, you aren\u2019t from a village, so you don\u2019t know, but ducks don\u2019t hatch their own eggs?\u201dYu Zhengdu fell silent for a moment. \u201c\u2026\u2026Is that so?\u201dLiu Wei stared at that peaceful duck. His expression made it seem like he had witnessed some miracle of nature. \u201cLeader, back where I\u2019m from, duck eggs all get hatched by female chickens\u2026\u2026\u201dMore accurately speaking, domesticated ducks didn\u2019t hatch their own eggs. Because humans had discovered, during the process of domestication, that ducks who hatched their own eggs were skinnier and laid less eggs, they had long since started training ducks to stop hatching their own eggs. Additionally, they replaced ducks with incubators to hatch the ducks\u2019 eggs. After generations of training, current domesticated ducks no longer hatched their eggs themselves.But obviously, not everybody knew this. At least, Yu Zhengdu and the group of ghosts at Luofeng didn\u2019t.Liu Wei lamented, \u201cWhat has this duck experienced?\u201dYu Zhengdu stared at this diligent duck who was hatching an egg with no complaints. His expression didn\u2019t even change as he said, \u201cI suppose this duck might have an extreme amount of maternal love.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s not entirely impossible.\u201d Liu Wei pondered for a moment and reluctantly accepted this explanation. He also came up with a supporting argument for it. \u201cAfter all, in the really beginning, ducks did hatch their own eggs. Though it\u2019s rare right now, there will still be one or two who occasionally want to nest.\u201dHis gaze remained on that quiet duck. He couldn\u2019t help ing in wonder. \u201cLeader, not only does your duck have maternal love, it\u2019s also very well behaved.\u201dYu Zhengdu nodded with a slight smile on his face, \u201c , she\u2019s a good duck.\u201dJust as he finished speaking, he heard the duck \u201cga\u2014\u2014\u201d once, then watched her stand up. Her bright little eyes stared at Yu Zhengdu, furiously sending a silent message.Thus, Yu Zhengdu told Liu Wei, \u201cShe\u2019s about to p.o.o.p. I haven\u2019t prepared a duck bathroom for her yet. For today, just temporarily take her to the bathroom in the office.\u201dLiu Wei looked at Yu Zhengdu. Liu Wei then turned to look at the duck. His expression became shocked. \u201cYour duck knows to use the bathroom at scheduled times?\u201d\u201c ,\u201d Yu Zhengdu calmly nodded. \u201cI told you, she\u2019s a good duck.\u201dIn a daze, Liu Wei watched as the duck hopped off the table and waddled behind him. Just as he was about to lead it to the bathroom, he instinctively turned around to glance at the egg the duck had been hatching. And then, his eyes widened again.\u201cLeader, this isn\u2019t a duck egg, right?\u201d Liu Wei pointed at that gigantic white egg and asked.\u201cI never said it was a duck egg.\u201d Yu Zhengdu caressed Peppa. \u201cThis is a goose egg.\u201dThere was a breath caught in Liu Wei\u2019s throat. After a long time, he finally squatted down while trembling and stroked the big white duck\u2019s feathers. \u201cLittle duck, what have you experienced?\u201dIt was fine that a duck was hatching an egg. But the fact that it wasn\u2019t even hatching a duck egg\u2026\u2026 Was this actually an overabundance of maternal love or was it the deformation of duck nature?\u201cGa\u2014\u2014\u201d The obedient, well-behaved big white duck suddenly spread its wings and slapped Liu Wei across the face with a wing. Then, it used its beak to peck, aiming straight at Liu Wei\u2019s palm.\u201cAo\u2014\u2014\u201d Liu Wei howled. \u201cLeader, there\u2019s something wrong with your duck!\u201dShang Que spent an entire morning in his office, agitated. He checked WeChat every few minutes. The managers of every department had all taken turns asking about work, but he still hadn\u2019t received the message he wanted.He replied to each manager, then approved all the reports that had been submitted. After finis.h.i.+ng all this, he had nothing to do and instantly became extremely agitated again.Shang Que thought about it and simply decided to log in and look around Weibo.The past few days, he had been submerged in the sweetness of romance (?). It had been quite a bit since he had used Weibo. As soon as he logged in, he received a considerable amount of notifications.He never checked his comments and reposts. He only checked a few select private messages.As soon as he clicked into his inbox, he realized that Professor Shen Wenrong from Diyang University had sent him a bunch of messages again.Previously, because Shang Que had used one of his fake accounts to diss the historical drama\u300aOld Dreams of Bianliang\u300bover having too many bugs in their plot, he had gotten cussed out by the drama\u2019s fans and ended up on the trending topics list. Eventually, a history professor at Diyang University, Shen Wenrong, had publicly confirmed Shang Que\u2019s historical viewpoints. Due to this, Shang Que\u2019s professional image became accepted by the public. Given the double temptation of his face and talents, he received many fans.After this incident, Shen Wenrong maintained contact with Shang Que. Later on, Shang Que had also explained a few difficult problems regarding Song history to him. Because of this, Shen Wenrong always hoped to invite Shang Que to attend their academic discussions. However, Shang Que had never agreed.Shang Que glanced at the private message Shen Wenrong had sent him and discovered that the other was sticking to protocol, as expected. He had once again invited him to attend a conference. This time, though, it wasn\u2019t an academic discussion. Instead, it was a symposium open to the public that had been organized by lovers of Song history.Shang Que offhandedly looked over it before coldly rejecting Shen Wenrong again. Then, he continued staring at his WeChat.Yu Zhengdu still hadn\u2019t messaged him.By lunch, Shang Que finally couldn\u2019t hold himself back anymore. The past few days, Yu Zhengdu had eaten lunch with him everyday. Now, it was almost mealtime, but Yu Zhengdu still hadn\u2019t said anything.He pondered a bit and placed an order using a takeout app. After, he shared a red envelope link with Yu Zhengdu.My Broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010Sent that by mistake\u3011My Broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010However, if you\u2019re also ordering takeout, you can grab the red envelope .\u3011A long time later, Yu Zhengdu finally responded.Yu Zhengdu:\u3010No need. I\u2019m eating with Liu Wei and them downstairs\u3011Shang Que:My Broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010You still haven\u2019t reported your work to me yet\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010Wrapped up the system\u2019s matters. There isn\u2019t anything I need special permission for over the next few days\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010[File: to-do list]\u3011Shang Que clicked into Yu Zhengdu\u2019s doc.u.ment to check. On it, Yu Zhengdu\u2019s schedule for the upcoming few days was listed. He discovered that Yu Zhengdu wasn\u2019t purposefully not reporting to him \u2013 the other honestly didn\u2019t need to.This was the first time Shang Que felt that it wasn\u2019t necessarily a good thing that his employee was so good at his work.Just as he was being glum, Lu Lingxi patched an internal call to him. Shen Wenrong was calling.Shen Wenrong naturally brought up the meeting he had mentioned in his private message. He said, \u201cBoss Shang, this isn\u2019t a normal meeting. Several private collectors will be attending with their collectibles. We\u2019ll be able to see many antiques from the Song Dynasty that usually aren\u2019t available for the general public to see. Don\u2019t you feel tempted at all?\u201dShang Que: \u201cNot at all.\u201dShen Wenrong momentarily didn\u2019t know how to respond. In embarra.s.sment, he said, \u201cWhy are you so against these events? This isn\u2019t even work. Just treat it like a vacation.\u201dShang Que was in the midst of examining Yu Zhengdu\u2019s work schedule. Upon hearing this, a lightbulb went on in his head. A smile appeared on his face. \u201cNo, this is work.\u201dShen Wenrong hurriedly said, \u201cIt really isn\u2019t\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt is work.\u201d Shang Que brightened up and said, \u201cProfessor Shen, I can attend. However, I\u2019ll need to bring an employee along.\u201dAs soon as Shen Wenrong realized that he was willing to attend, he instantly became overjoyed. How could he reject Shang Que\u2019s request? He immediately agreed, \u201cOf course. That won\u2019t be a problem.\u201dOn the other side, Yu Zhengdu had been in the middle of eating lunch when his WeChat lit up again.My Broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010Go on a business trip with me the day after tomorrow\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010For what?\u3011My Broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010Attending a symposium about Song history\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010\u2026\u2026That\u2019s part of my job description too?\u3011My Broke-a.s.s Boss:\u3010Yep. I just added it to your to-do list\u3011Yu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d<b>The author has something to say:</b>Peppa: Ga!

When Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que arrived at the capital, though, they discovered that this symposium wasn\u2019t private in the slightest. There was an impressive number of guests present: not only were there famous experts in the field, there were also several incredibly rich businessmen.In comparison to the other guests who were being picked up and dropped off by luxury cars, Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que seemed extremely down to earth\u2014\u2014they had taken a taxi over from the airport. Fortunately, the two of them used their exceptional appearances to maintain an air of elegance. Especially Shang Que\u2019s face, which, when he wasn\u2019t speaking, was strikingly handsome. No matter where he stood, he could instantly become the center of attention.The location of the symposium was a relatively famous high-end convention center. When Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que arrived, Shen Wenrong\u2019s a.s.sistant came out to receive them.\u201cRight now, Professor Shen and his teacher, Old Mr. w.a.n.g, are getting interviewed by the media. He can\u2019t leave at the moment, so has told me to show you guys around first,\u201d the a.s.sistant explained while leading them around.Yu Zhengdu asked, perplexed, \u201cIsn\u2019t this a private symposium? How come there are interviews with the media?\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s a private symposium in that all the attendees are attending under their own name. There aren\u2019t any guests from organizations. However, the symposium is open to the public,\u201d the a.s.sistant shared. \u201cThe media were invited by the event organizer as well. They\u2019re all very credible media sources. You\u2019ll see in a bit.\u201dThen, he listed a few of the media sources present today. As soon as he heard their names, Yu Zhengdu thought . There were even two top-tier official media sources.Yu Zhengdu smiled and said, \u201cThe event organizer has a lot of prowess.\u201d\u201cRight?\u201d The a.s.sistant thought that the two of them were good looking. Yu Zhengdu was also a good conversation partner. Thus, he couldn\u2019t help diverging a few additional details. He lowered his voice and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you guys the truth. This time, on paper, the event organizer is the Gou family. In actuality, though, they also have Meng Hua\u2019s resources secretly helping them.\u201d\u201cMeng Hua is?\u201d Yu Zhengdu became curious after hearing this.He was a homebody technician with no talent for art whatsoever. Before this, he had never paid attention to any news regarding this field. He had only looked up some information about the event organizers because he was going to attend this symposium. He knew that the Gou family, who were the hosts this time, were a very influential family in the historian circle. They were especially educated in Song history. Old Mr. Gou, the head of the Gou family who had pa.s.sed away a few years ago, had been the utmost authority in the Song history field. Many of the famous historians in the field now all had some connection to him. Additionally, the Gou family also had a large collection of antiques. According to rumors, their family owned several antiques that could be considered national treasures.Because of the Gou family\u2019s reputable background, Yu Zhengdu had never really formed any expectations for how majestic this symposium would be. He had thought that this was all due to the Gou family\u2019s connections. Unexpectedly, there was also another source of power behind everything.However, Yu Zhengdu had a limited understanding in this regard. For example, the name \u201cMeng Hua\u201d that the a.s.sistant had mentioned was completely foreign to him.\u201cThey\u2019re an auction house that has recently started gaining traction. They mainly auction off antiques from the Song Dynasty,\u201d the a.s.sistant replied.Shang Que suddenly b.u.t.ted in from the side, \u201cTheir name is taken from \u2018 Dong Jing Meng Hua Lu ,\u2019 right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The a.s.sistant nodded. He looked around and, after realizing that n.o.body was paying attention to them, scooted close and said, \u201cThe CEO of Meng Hua is named Liu Ao. He was a student of the now deceased Old Mr. Gou.\u201dYu Zhengdu glanced at the a.s.sistant. He felt like the other\u2019s words were hinting at a deeper truth. But the little a.s.sistant only gossiped for a moment. There were lots of strings attached to resources such as these. Obviously, someone of his standing wouldn\u2019t be allowed to touch these secrets.They had entered the convention center during their conversation. This convention center had originally been high-end. Now, it had been additionally decorated to appear even more splendid. The overall style was rather unique. Even Yu Zhengdu, a homebody technician who didn\u2019t have much of an eye for beauty, couldn\u2019t help expressing his awe.Also, exactly as Shen Wenrong had previously told Shang Que, this symposium had invited several private collectors to lend their collectibles to the main event sponsors, in addition to inviting many famous experts. The amount of security on site was exceptionally high. Though the entire event wasn\u2019t comparable to an official exhibition, many of these private collectibles usually weren\u2019t allowed to be seen by the general public. There weren\u2019t too many items, but it wasn\u2019t too exaggerated to describe the items present as priceless. The people wandering around the symposium were also adorned in jewels and carrying themselves with a haughty air. It was obvious that they were all rich and wealthy.While walking, the a.s.sistant introduced the private collectibles on display today. He himself was also part of the Song history research a.s.sociation, meaning he was pretty interested in these items. His explanations were very detailed. Halfway through the tour, they noticed a middle-aged man helping a hale and hearty old man walk over from the direction of the reception area. There were also a few other people behind them.\u201cProfessor Shen and Old Mr. w.a.n.g are here,\u201d the a.s.sistant told Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que. Then, he led them forward to greet Shen Wenrong.\u201cMr. Shang, we finally meet.\u201d Originally, Shen Wenrong\u2019s expression hadn\u2019t been too pleased. After seeing Shang Que, he finally brightened up a bit. He introduced Shang Que to the elderly man beside him with a smile, \u201cTeacher, this is Mr. Shang Que, the one who helped me resolve several difficult academic problems.\u201dHe also said to Shang Que, \u201cMr. Shang, this is my teacher. You\u2019re so educated in Song history, you must have heard of his name before: w.a.n.g Gezhi.\u201dYu Zhengdu had originally been smiling off to the side, remaining silent and doing his best to pretend to be a professional employee. As soon as he heard Shen Wenrong say this, he hurriedly turned to look at Shang Que. As expected, Shang Que\u2019s expression read . Yu Zhengdu was terrified that Shang Que would directly say what he was thinking, so instantly pushed the other\u2019s hands down and replied for him with a smile, \u201cOf course we\u2019ve heard of him. Old Mr. w.a.n.g\u2019s name is quite famous. His reputation precedes him.\u201dShang Que side-eyed Yu Zhengdu. Then, he nodded as well and calmly said, \u201c , I know him.\u201dYu Zhengdu sighed in relief before secretly pulling out his phone to look up w.a.n.g Gezhi\u2019s name. As expected, he really was a famous person \u2013 the kind who had their own Baike page.It turned out that Old Mr. w.a.n.g was a very reputable scholar in the Song history circle. Not only so, he was also an authority figure when it came to authenticating Song Dynasty antiques.Yu Zhengdu combined all the circ.u.mstances regarding today\u2019s supposed symposium and came up with a guess in his heart. Rather than saying this was a discussion about Song history, it was more accurate to say this was an antiques exhibition carrying on under the guise of a Song history symposium.Among the experts present, aside from Shen Wenrong and his teacher, a majority of them were antique identifiers, not historians.Old Mr. w.a.n.g Gezhi\u2019s expression thawed. He told Shang Que, \u201cWenrong mentioned you a lot in the past. A pity that I never got the chance to converse with you face to face. I never expected for you to be so handsome as well.\u201dAt this time, a smartly dressed woman suddenly looked at Shang Que in shock from behind the old mister. She asked, \u201cCould this be the owner of the famous Weibo account, From Today On I Will Be A European G.o.d?\u201dYu Zhengdu almost burst into laughter on the spot.Shang Que\u2019s Weibo ID seemed normal when you saw it online, but when someone read it out loud so officially, it suddenly felt very embarra.s.sing.Old Mr. w.a.n.g probably didn\u2019t use Weibo. For a moment, he didn\u2019t understand. Shen Wenrong\u2019s expression started turning green, though \u2013 it was obvious that he was holding his laughter in. However, he ultimately succeeded in not laughing and introduced, \u201cThat\u2019s him. However, we usually don\u2019t call him that.\u201dThat woman hurriedly nodded. \u201cRight right right, I know. Everyone online calls him CEO.\u201dShen Wenrong then introduced the woman. It turned out that she was a reporter for an official media source and was named Shu Yujing. No wonder she acted so serious, even reading a Weibo ID out loud.\u201cI hadn\u2019t expected that CEO would attend too. I\u2019ll need to interview you in private later. That way, people will be sure to click our link,\u201d Shu Yujing joked. Shang Que wasn\u2019t extremely influential among the historians, but he was viral online.w.a.n.g Gezhi didn\u2019t understand these Internet matters. He was also rather cold to Shu Yujing. Thus, he didn\u2019t respond to her joke. He decided to say to Shang Que instead, \u201cWenrong said that Mr. Shang is very educated in the culture of the two Song Dynasties . When we have the time later, why not sit down and have a discussion?\u201dShang Que didn\u2019t care either way. He casually nodded. \u201c .\u201dShu Yujing got ignored, but whether this had been intentional or unintentional couldn\u2019t be known for sure. She felt a bit humiliated, so changed the topic in embarra.s.sment. Coincidentally, they were standing next to an item on display. Thus, she pointed at the item and asked Shang Que with a smile, \u201cOh right. Mr. Shang is an expert on Song history too. You must be quite informed about these things too, right?\u201dYu Zhengdu turned to look at Shang Que as well. Speaking of, Shang Que seemed to be someone who had lived through that era. As such, he ought to be more familiar with these items than others would be.Only to see Shang Que casually glance at that display item and calmly say, \u201cNope. Not informed at all.\u201dShu Yujing had originally been waiting for Shang Que to share some impressive insight. Upon hearing this, she had no response. She could only awkwardly ask, \u201cIs that so?\u2019She couldn\u2019t help muttering to herselfYu Zhengdu was slightly surprised too. He looked at Shang Que. \u201cI thought that you would be quite familiar with these things?\u201d\u201cThese are antiques.\u201d Shang Que furrowed his brows. \u201cI\u2019m only familiar with life during the Song Dynasty. I know nothing about antiques.\u201dYu Zhengdu reached a realization after brief consideration. Though Shang Que had lived during that era, that didn\u2019t necessarily mean that he could identify antiques from that era.Antique identification was a very advanced skill. One needed to be able to establish the antique\u2019s age, place of origin, authenticity, etc. These weren\u2019t things that people who had lived in that era could easily determine. This was just like people who lived in modern times: they were extremely familiar with the things belonging to their era, but for most people, they couldn\u2019t even tell if a high quality counterfeit purse was the real deal or not. It was even more impossible for them to identify antiques.w.a.n.g Gezhi glanced at Shu Yujing, displeased. \u201cYou reporters need to stop asking about things you don\u2019t understand. These are two different fields.\u201dThough Shu Yujing wasn\u2019t a petty person, she was still an official reporter. Being scolded by w.a.n.g Gezhi like this in public made her more or less feel a bit humiliated. Thus, her expression darkened. Just as she was about to turn around and leave them, a large commotion sounded out from the main entrance.Everyone looked in that direction, only to see a tall, st.u.r.dily built middle-aged man with a beer belly walk in. He was surrounded by a crowd of people. Behind him, a swarm of reporters followed as well. Their camera flashed incessantly.w.a.n.g Gezhi and Shen Wenrong\u2019s expressions instantly became foul.Shu Yujing\u2019s eyes lit up, though. She hurriedly told the cameraman following her, \u201cGou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g is here. Hurry and get a few extra pictures.\u201dIt turned out this man was the host of today\u2019s symposium \u2013 the current head of the Gou family, Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g.Only to hear w.a.n.g Gezhi say through clenched teeth from nearby, \u201cCovered in filthy money. He\u2019s forgotten his roots.\u201dYu Zhengdu couldn\u2019t help glancing at w.a.n.g Gezhi.At this time, Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g noticed them too. He instantly revealed a smile and walked over, politely bowing to w.a.n.g Gezhi. He shouted, \u201c s.h.i.+shu , how wonderful that you could make it.\u201dYu Zhengdu felt a bit surprised upon hearing the term Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g used to refer to w.a.n.g Gezhi. He instinctively turned to look at Shang Que. He only realized after already turning around that Shang Que probably didn\u2019t know anything about the relations.h.i.+p between them either.Shang Que truly didn\u2019t know. However, upon noticing Yu Zhengdu\u2019s curious gaze, he thought about it and took the rare initiative to ask Shen Wenrong, \u201cWhat\u2019s their relations.h.i.+p?\u201dShen Wenrong said, \u201cGou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g\u2019s father, Old Mr. Gou, is my teacher\u2019s s.h.i.+xiong.\u201dShang Que nodded. He turned to look at Yu Zhengdu. Yu Zhengdu returned the gaze:On the other side, w.a.n.g Gezhi\u2019s expression had already hardened. \u201cDon\u2019t get happy so soon. I\u2019m only here to see what embarra.s.sing things you\u2019re capable of doing.\u201dHe was very impolite, but Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g didn\u2019t seem to care at all. He even stated, rather pleased, 's.h.i.+shu, how could this be considered embarra.s.sing? Look at how successful today\u2019s symposium is. There are even several credible reporters here. When the news articles get published, they\u2019ll definitely be able to garner an enormous response from society. Our influence will definitely become even greater too.\u201dw.a.n.g Gezhi scoffed, \u201cWe\u2019re researchers. Why do we need influence?\u201dA man standing next to Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g spoke up with a chuckle, 's.h.i.+shu, you\u2019re too old-fas.h.i.+oned. There\u2019s a gold mine before you, but you refuse to extract any gold from it. What a waste of the connections and reputation you have in this field.\u201dYu Zhengdu turned to look at Shang Que. Thus, Shang Que asked Shen Wenrong again. Shen Wenrong answered, \u201cHe\u2019s Old Mr. Gou\u2019s student, Liu Ao.\u201dYu Zhengdu was struck by realization. So this was the CEO of Meng Hua.Though Yu Zhengdu didn\u2019t understand the rules of this field, the fact that the head of the Gou family and the CEO of an auction house had appeared together more or less caused him to make some connections, even though he was an outsider to this field.As expected, before w.a.n.g Gezhi could fly into a fit, a man dressed in a tailored suit walked over, surrounded by a crowd of people. He greeted w.a.n.g Gezhi before shaking hands with Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g and Liu Ao. \u201cBoss Gou, Boss Liu, you\u2019re finally here. I\u2019ve waited a long time for you two.\u201dThis time, Yu Zhengdu didn\u2019t need to signal to Shang Que through his gaze anymore. Shang Que himself very conscientiously turned to Shen Wenrong. Shen Wenrong had also developed a conditioned reflex. \u201cHe\u2019s the wealthiest businessman in the capital and is also very famous among the antique collectors. His name is Zhan Wei.\u201dLiu Ao said with a smile, \u201cPlease forgive us, Boss Zhan.\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bis a collectible that could be considered a national treasure. We naturally had to be careful and cautious, which is why we\u2019ve arrived a little bit late.\u201d\u201cOf course, of course,\u201d Zhan Wei replied. \u201cHow rare that Boss Gou is willing to take\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bout for everyone to see. It\u2019s worth it for us to wait a while longer.\u201dw.a.n.g Gezhi\u2019s eyes widened beside them. He pointed at Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g and asked, \u201cYou brought\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bout?\u201d\u201cSo many collectors have lended their collectibles out for display this time. I obviously need to do my part too,\u201d Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g said.An argument was taking place on that side. On this side, Shen Wenrong heaved out a long sigh.Yu Zhengdu asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Professor Shen?\u201d\u201cFrom now on, things probably aren\u2019t going to go the way Teacher wants them to,\u201d Shen Wenrong softly explained. \u201cThis Liu Ao is supported by immense wealth. He\u2019s always wanted to use the reputation of the Gou family to increase his range of influence. However, when Old Mr. Gou was still alive, he didn\u2019t allow their plans to prevail. Now that Old Mr. Gou has pa.s.sed away, though, Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g and Liu Ao have immediately started collaborating\u2026\u2026\u201dLike this symposium. On the outside, the Gou family was hosting. But in actuality, it was being pushed into existence by the resources of Meng Hua. Otherwise, the influence of the Gou family alone wouldn\u2019t be enough to get so many experts to attend. It also wasn\u2019t enough to get all these collectors to lend out their collectibles.w.a.n.g Gezhi and the deceased Old Mr. Gou were the best of friends and brothers. Naturally, he was incredibly displeased with the way Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g was using the Gou family reputation right now. Only, no matter how displeased he was, he was ultimately still an outsider. He had no power to alter Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g\u2019s decision.For today\u2019s meeting, Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g had used the ruse of a Song history discussion to invite w.a.n.g Gezhi and Shen Wenrong. Additionally, there were many rare antiques being put on display. w.a.n.g Gezhi had thought that Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g had finally abandoned the wrongful path and found his way back to the light. But when he had arrived on site, he had instantly been pushed to accept an interview with the media.Why were interviews necessary at a private symposium?w.a.n.g Gezhi thought of all the things Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g had done in the past and naturally made a largely accurate a.s.sumption about his true intentions.This supposed symposium was most likely a stepping stone for Meng Hua Auction House. All of these experts were only tools for Meng Hua to prove their professionalism.After hearing Shen Wenrong\u2019s explanation, Yu Zhengdu finally understood. No wonder Old Mr. w.a.n.g had looked so angry this whole time; no wonder he had been so cold towards the reporters.Following Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g and Liu Ao\u2019s arrival, all the reporters and attendees surrounded them. Obviously, everyone knew that the climax of today\u2019s meeting was about to begin.This convention center had been carefully set up. There was a small stage in the middle of the convention center. Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g stepped onto it at the urging of everyone else. The cameras immediately started rolling.As a reporter from an official media source, Shu Yujing walked forward first. She asked, \u201cBoss Gou, I\u2019ve heard that today, you\u2019re going to display the Gou family\u2019s rare and prized treasure,\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300b, the work of famed Northern Song artist Qu Lanzhi. Is that correct?\u201dAs soon as Shu Yujing asked this question, everyone present fell silent in antic.i.p.ation. Obviously, aside from w.a.n.g Gezhi and his student, everyone else had already heard the news in advance.Even Yu Zhengdu, someone who didn\u2019t understand antiques at all, felt surprised. There was no other reason \u2013 Qu Lanzhi was honestly too famous. He was one of those historical figures that often appeared in history textbooks.As a celebrity from the Song Dynasty, Qu Lanzhi had supposedly been an expert calligrapher and artist. His art and calligraphy pieces were all treasures in Huaxia history. His current surviving works were basically only viewable at national museums. It was exceptionally rare for any private collectors to own any.Yu Zhengdu pulled out his phone and looked the t.i.tle up.\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bwas an early piece by Qu Lanzhi. It wasn\u2019t very famous compared to his other works, but it combined both his artistic and calligraphy talents, making it a very valuable collector\u2019s piece.The Gou family actually owned Qu Lanzhi\u2019s work. No matter which piece of work it was, it was more than enough to outs.h.i.+ne all the items on display right now. No wonder the other collectors were willing to lend out their collectibles. First, disregarding any possible benefits Meng Hua was secretly giving them, the simple fact that Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g was willing to bring\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bout was sufficient to tempt all the other collectors.\u201cWhat a rare opportunity that so many people of the same taste could be here today. It is my honor to have the chance to discuss the identification and appreciation of antiques with everyone.\u201d Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g waved his hands, gesturing for the workers to move\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bonstage. \u201cI\u2019ll have to ask all our friends in the media to turn off your flash before taking any pictures.\u201d\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bwas carefully protected by reinforced gla.s.s. The workers cautiously carried it onstage.As soon as this rare treasure appeared, various exclamations of shock instantly sounded out from the audience. The media also charged forward to take innumerous photos. Fortunately, the convention center was well prepared for this: they had arranged for security guards in advance. By splitting up the crowd of viewers, they managed to avoid chaos.Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g generously stood off to the side and allowed the media to take pictures. Meanwhile, he introduced the history behind\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300b: \u201c\u2026\u2026As everyone knows, there are an exceptionally small number of Qu Lanzhi\u2019s works that have survived. Currently, only the Capital Museum and Bian Provincial Museum are in possession of his work. As for pieces belonging to private collectors, I fear that only the\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bof our Gou family exists.\u201dw.a.n.g Gezhi quietly condemned, \u201cThe treasure of the Gou family, being used in this manner to make him appear more reputable\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cTeacher, calm down,\u201d Shen Wenrong placated. Before he could finish his sentence, though, he heard Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g announce an astonis.h.i.+ng piece of information.\u201cNext, I plan to entrust\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bto Meng Hua Auction House for auctioning. The time of sale has been set for New Year\u2019s Day. Those interested can ask for more information,\u201d Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g said.w.a.n.g Gezhi\u2019s eyes widened. He no longer cared about all the media present. He pointed at Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g and yelled, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201dThe old man had a loud voice. He instantly garnered a lot of attention. w.a.n.g Gezhi\u2019s face was red with anger. \u201cYou unfilial son. You actually dare to auction\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300boff. Don\u2019t you think you\u2019re letting your father down?\u201dGou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g looked over at him, completely composed. He smiled and said, 's.h.i.+shu, this is the Gou family\u2019s possession. It\u2019s not up to outsiders to question what I do with it, right?\u201dw.a.n.g Gezhi was so outraged that his entire body was shaking. \u201cYour ancestors in the Gou family spent generation after generation carefully protecting this painting. Yet you\u2019re ruining it just like this?\u201d\u201cHow could this be considered ruining?\u201d Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g asked. \u201cAs everyone knows, Meng Hua Auction House is currently the most professional auction house in the nation. Whether you\u2019re considering the collectibles being auctioned off or the consumers buying these collectibles, we are the top of the game. It absolutely cannot be considered ruining if this painting is auctioned off by Meng Hua.\u201dw.a.n.g Gezhi wanted to say something else, but he had already gotten held down by the workers who had been placed next to him ahead of time. They didn\u2019t give him the opportunity to speak again.Liu Ao picked this time to add, \u201cOld Mr. w.a.n.g knows that this is an authentic artifact that has been pa.s.sed down for generations in the Gou family. Thus, his heart hurts. But I trust that the results of Meng Hua\u2019s final transaction won\u2019t disappoint the old mister.\u201dBy now, Yu Zhengdu finally understood the true purpose of this symposium.Just as w.a.n.g Gezhi had guessed at first, this symposium had been held to increase Meng Hua Auction House\u2019s influence. The experts, wealthy businessmen, and media were all there for promotion, but also for endors.e.m.e.nt.However, the most important part of the plan to increase Meng Hua\u2019s influence was to auction off a rare, authentic antique.\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bwas this representative piece.w.a.n.g Gezhi was also part of their plan. They clearly knew that w.a.n.g Gezhi would publicly object to their actions, but had still invited him to attend. This was because he was very influential and also the s.h.i.+di of Old Mr. Gou. Additionally, his emotional reaction would provide the most convincing argument to prove that this\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bwas truly an authentic antique.Yu Zhengdu glanced at w.a.n.g Gezhi with sympathy. The old mister was in the middle of panting. Shen Wenrong was beside him, helping him smooth out his breathing. However, the workers were also right next to him. They refused to let the old man get close to the stage.Onstage, Liu Ao revealed a smile. \u201cWe have already invited experts to approximate the value of\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300b. Our final decision is that we will start the auctioning price at one hundred million RMB.\u201dA tumultuous commotion instantly broke out. Furthermore, the cameras kept clicking away.w.a.n.g Gezhi pounded on his chest. \u201cWhat a sinner. If s.h.i.+xiong were still alive, he absolutely wouldn\u2019t have allowed\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bto be used by merchants in such a manner.\u201dLiu Ao smiled and said, \u201cOld man, we\u2019re going to need to perform another round of authentications prior to the official auction. As long as you don\u2019t mind, we\u2019d be more than happy to have you join our team of authenticators. After all, you\u2019re the one who currently understands\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bbest in this country. If you\u2019re the authenticator, our clients will be able to rest more at ease.\u201dHow could w.a.n.g Gezhi not know that he had been used? He instantly became even angrier; he couldn\u2019t even get a single word out.Yu Zhengdu\u2019s gaze was full of pity. He sighed, \u201cI believe that at this time, the old mister would probably rather find out that this\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bis fake.\u201dShang Que calmly stated from next to him, \u201cIt is fake.\u201dYu Zhengdu temporarily couldn\u2019t react to this statement. He went, \u201cHuh?\u201d Then, he turned around to look at Shang Que. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\u201cTheir\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300b\u2026\u2026\u201d Shang Que glanced onstage at the famous painting being held up by workers, \u201cis fake.\u201dShang Que didn\u2019t speak very loudly, but because they were close to w.a.n.g Gezhi, which was an area many people were paying attention to, a lot of people still heard him.Coincidentally, Shu Yujing was nearby too. Upon hearing this, she quickly asked, \u201cMr. Shang, may I ask if you just said that this\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bis fake?\u201dShu Yujing had her own photographer. As soon as she asked her question, the camera immediately turned around and focused in this direction, which caught the interest of several people.At this time, other reporters recognized Shang Que too. They started asking, \u201cIsn\u2019t this person that Internet-famous Song historian on Weibo?\u201d\u201cYes, he\u2019s really famous. What\u2019s his name again? From Today On\u2026\u2026\uff1f\u201d\u201cCEO, they call him CEO. I recall that Professor Shen Wenrong admires him a lot.\u201d\u201cRight right right. That\u2019s him.\u201dSome people recognized him, but there were also people who didn\u2019t recognize him. That didn\u2019t matter, though. After hearing the discussions of those around them, they learned that this person had great influence online and was also quite professionally educated. Didn\u2019t this mean that his words ought to be carefully considered?Especially because he had such an exceptional outer appearance. If not for anything else, it was still worth it to take a few extra photos of him.In only an instant, all the cameras had already turned to focus on Shang Que. \u201cCEO, did you just say that this\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bis a fake??\u201dShang Que was a bit impatient, but, out of regard for Shen Wenrong, he still patiently replied, \u201cYes, it\u2019s a counterfeit.\u201dAs soon as he said this, Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g\u2019s expression darkened. He yelled, \u201cWho are you? How dare you spout bulls.h.i.+t here?\u201dIf this were a n.o.body, that would be fine. However, this person actually seemed like he had some sort of fame. Liu Ao hurriedly pulled a reporter he was familiar with over to ask. After learning that this was an Internet celebrity, he calmed down. He walked forward and said with a smile, \u201cSir, you can\u2019t just say things like that.\u201dShang Que was half a head taller than him. He stared down at the other. \u201cI can prove it.\u201dLiu Ao had no response. Everyone else almost choked on air.Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g couldn\u2019t help it anymore. He walked forward too and scoffed. \u201c\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bhas been pa.s.sed down for generations in my family. This is my first time hearing anyone dare to say it\u2019s counterfeit. I guess you mustn\u2019t have a great understanding of the Gou family\u2019s history.\u201dThe media around them were very excited about this drama. They caused an uproar. \u201cCEO, do you have any evidence to prove your statement?\u201dLiu Ao stopped being so polite. Expression hard, he said, \u201cYou only understand a bit of Song history. Understanding history and understanding antiques are two different things.\u201dHis words reminded Shu Yujing. Shu Yujing made a sound of suspicion and asked, \u201cSpeaking of, CEO, didn\u2019t you just say that you don\u2019t understand antiques? How come you\u2019re so sure now that this painting is fake?\u201dHer words gained a lot of attention. Everyone\u2019s gazes suddenly turned dubious as they looked at Shang Que. \u201cCEO, so do you understand antique identification or not?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Shang Que replied very briskly.As soon as he said this, all the media present instantly went: = =Liu Ao and Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g simultaneously chuckled coldly. Just as Liu Ao was about to mock Shang Que, he heard Shang Que continue to say, \u201cHowever, the real\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bis in my possession.\u201d<b>The author has something to say:</b>Is Boss a broke-a.s.s today?

    "Chapter 89": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/New Times, New HellChapter 90 - Real or Fake Famous PaintingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 90 - Real or Fake Famous PaintingAs soon as Shang Que said this, the crowd went into an uproar.Everyone turned to look at Shang Que, shocked. Yu Zhengdu scanned their surroundings and discovered that everyone\u2019s shock could be largely separated into two categories: one was truly astounded and shocked. The other was shocked in a way that read \u201cwow, you really dare to bluff.\u201dOld Mr. w.a.n.g, Shen Wenrong, Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g, and Liu Ao belonged to the latter category.Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g burst into laughter on the spot out of anger.Antique painting and calligraphy identification was something that only a very small number of people understood. The majority of people only blindly listened to experts\u2019 statements. Regardless of if the item was authentic or not, as long as a slightly influential person listed a few suspicions they had, this would naturally cause doubts among a portion of the population.Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g had originally been worried that Shang Que would be capable of truly sharing some credible opinions. Though he wasn\u2019t necessarily scared, a great amount of time and energy would still be needed to eventually refute the other\u2019s claims.He had never expected, in his wildest dreams, for Shang Que to be so careless and straight to the point. Or, it could be said that the other was outrageously bold. He even dared to spout such a huge lie.Right now, Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g wasn\u2019t agitated in the slightest anymore. He was even slightly inclined to slowly tease Shang Que. This way, he could create a more interesting headline for their press conference. He gazed at Shang Que and asked with a smile, \u201cYou say that the real\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bis in your possession?\u201dShang Que side-eyed him nonchalantly. He only hummed in acknowledgement from the back of his throat.Now, even Old Mr. w.a.n.g Gezhi, who was on Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g\u2019s opposing side, couldn\u2019t keep his back straight. He sighed and said, \u201cMr. Shang, you can\u2019t say things like that out of the blue. Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g is a b.a.s.t.a.r.d, but to be perfectly honest, the Gou family\u2019s\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bis truly authentic.\u201dHere, he couldn\u2019t help sighing again. It was exactly because the Gou family\u2019s\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bwas authentic that he felt so much pain and regret upon hearing about Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g\u2019s plans. However, regret was one matter; the old man\u2019s professional integrity was a different matter. Regardless of how much he hated Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g, he couldn\u2019t possibly lie through his teeth and slander the Gou family.\u201cDid you hear what the old man just said?\u201d Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g looked at Shang Que, expression pleased.\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d Shang Que furrowed his brows. \u201cThat you\u2019re a b.a.s.t.a.r.d?\u201dGou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g almost choked to death. A while later, he finally angrily ground his teeth together and continued to say, \u201cI fear that you don\u2019t know the truth.\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bhas been pa.s.sed down in the Gou family for hundreds of years. Everyone in the Song history research circles and antique collection circles knows this. Before you start bluffing, at least do some homework, okay?\u201dYu Zhengdu was also curiously gazing at Shang Que from off to the side. Given his understanding of Shang Que, the other absolutely wouldn\u2019t lie about this kind of thing. However, regardless of Old Mr. w.a.n.g Gezhi\u2019s reaction or the reactions of all the other collectors present, it seemed that the\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bbelonging to the Gou family was truly an authentic piece.What was actually going on?He couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cThe real one is really in your possession?\u201dShang Que made a sound of acknowledgment.Liu Ao took this opportunity to step forward. With an insincere smile, he stared at Shang Que. \u201cSince you say that the real\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bis in your possession, why not take it out now so everyone can authenticate and appreciate it? Coincidentally, there are many experts here today. They\u2019ll definitely be able to expose the truth to everyone.\u201dShang Que stood in place, silent.Yu Zhengdu lowered his voice and asked him, \u201cYou\u2026\u2026don\u2019t want to take it out?\u201dHe knew that Shang Que had a qiankun spell in his sleeve. In it, there were many of Shang Que\u2019s personal items. When Shang Que had visited his house previously, he had brought over that set of rabbit fur black glaze tea cups in this manner. As such, Yu Zhengdu didn\u2019t suspect at all that Shang Que was capable of carrying a painting around on his person.\u201cThat\u2019s not it.\u201d Shang Que paused for a moment and whispered in response, \u201cI just feel like pulling a painting out from my sleeve in public isn\u2019t very elegant.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWas this a problem of elegance or inelegance?\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bwasn\u2019t a small painting. If Shang Que really pulled it out from his sleeve, everyone present probably wouldn\u2019t be trying to authenticate the painting anymore. Instead, they\u2019d probably be trying to authenticate Shang Que\u2019s sleeve.Upon noticing that Shang Que still wasn\u2019t reacting, some people started getting impatient. Shu Yujing had conversed with Shang Que beforehand. Thus, she helped mediate the situation. \u201cCEO hasn\u2019t brought it along, right?\u201dThis was believable too. After all, n.o.body carried a painting around with them for no reason when they headed out.But Liu Ao refused to give Shang Que the opportunity to evade responsibility. He instantly scoffed and said, \u201cWhat an excellent plan. Bluffing without proof and saying that you own the authentic painting. Then, saying that you didn\u2019t bring it here today to avoid taking responsibility. You get to play good cop and bad cop. However, that\u2019s not how we do things around here\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu interrupted, \u201cHe brought it.\u201dLiu Ao didn\u2019t manage to finish his sentence. He almost choked to death. It took a long time before he could react. He scoffed. \u201cSince he\u2019s brought it, why not take it out?\u201dBy now, it was impossible to not take the painting out for a closer examination. Though Yu Zhengdu was still hesitant in his heart, he had absolute faith in Shang Que. He gazed at Shang Que. \u201cBoss, I trust you.\u201dShang Que suddenly turned around and headed towards the back. Yu Zhengdu stayed in place, politely smiling and acting as a representative. \u201cPlease wait a moment. Our Boss is retrieving it.\u201dLiu Ao scoffed. \u201cMr. Shang is truly so prepared. He even stored the item in advance, I guess?\u201dYu Zhengdu\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change. \u201cYep.\u201dShen Wenrong and w.a.n.g Gezhi made eye contact off to the side. The old mister only felt like his heart was getting squeezed. \u201cWenrong , this Mr. Shang that you\u2019ve invited isn\u2019t a scammer, right\u2026\u2026\u201dAt this time, Shen Wenrong had already spiraled into deep confusion. He had only interacted with Shang Que online in the past. He had no clue that Shang Que was so strange in person.While they were still conversing, Shang Que had already returned. He was casually carrying a slightly yellowed scroll painting in his hand. \u201cGo ahead and authenticate it.\u201dHe had taken this scroll painting out too carelessly. There also weren\u2019t any protective measures in place. In comparison to the Gou family\u2019sk300J;Trip to Songfeng Pavilionk300K;that was carefully encased in reinforced gla.s.s, there was a world of difference.It didn\u2019t look as impressive as a national treasure painting should look at all.Everyone present instantly fell into a deathly silence. Their expressions all seemed to be saying \u201cyou\u2019re kidding me.\u201dEspecially Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g, who started guffawing. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me this is the real\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300b?\u201dShang Que was too lazy to bother with him. There was a flat gla.s.s display counter next to him. He offhandedly placed the scroll painting on it. After gently flicking his wrist, the scroll started rolling; the slightly yellowed art piece unfurled, revealing a historical painting.This painting was covered in boundless strokes, making it appear extremely carefree. The calligraphy was bold and majestic, as if it had been inscribed with a sharp blade.It was exactly Qu Lanzhi\u2019s\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300b.Those who had initially been planning on mocking Shang Que all inhaled sharply.The feeling this painting gave off was too astonis.h.i.+ng. Even the reporters, who didn\u2019t understand painting or calligraphy at all, could feel the artist\u2019s energy exuding from the painting.Everyone instinctively turned to look at this painting. Then, they turned their gazes onstage to look at the\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bowned by the Gou family. At first glance, these two paintings were practically identical. It was difficult for one to tell which was real and which was fake within a short amount of time.Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g\u2019s expression changed as well, but he very quickly reacted. He revealed a generous smile and said, \u201cYour painting has been falsified quite well.\u201dOff to the side, w.a.n.g Gezhi\u2019s expression had changed too. With Shen Wenrong\u2019s help, he walked over and exclaimed, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen such an expertly falsified\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300b.\u201d\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bhad always been privately owned by the Gou family. This was something that true antique collectors knew. As such, there wasn\u2019t anyone who wanted to imitate this painting. Additionally, this painting was very rarely brought out in public. There weren\u2019t too many people who had ever seen the real deal, meaning that n.o.body could realistically imitate it even if they wanted to. The versions available on the market were all very blurry photos.This was also why everyone present had been so shocked when Shang Que had unrolled the scroll.Aside from the media, those in attendance were either experts or wealthy professional collectors. Everyone knew that\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bshouldn\u2019t have such a high quality counterfeit.Shang Que was completely unbothered by Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g\u2019s words. He only stood off to the side and calmly said, \u201cGo ahead and authenticate.\u201d\u201cDo we still need to authenticate this?\u201d Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g burst into laughter. He pointed at Shang Que\u2019s painting and said, \u201cSo what if your painting is almost a perfect replica? Can\u2019t you tell that your painting is missing the most important part?\u201dEveryone carefully observed the painting after hearing what he had said. They also realized that there was a big problem with this painting.The Gou family\u2019s\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bhad been treated as an authentic antique by collectors for several hundred years. One of the most important reasons was that this painting was covered in several collectors\u2019 seals . Aside from a collector\u2019s seal from a renowned Ming Dynasty collector, there was also a private seal belonging to an emperor of the Ming Dynasty.However, the painting that Shang Que had brought out was too clean. Aside from Qu Lanzhi\u2019s painting, poem, and personal seal, there was nothing else.Thus, a collector said, \u201cTruly. The painting Mr. Shang has taken out has no private collectors\u2019 seals. This isn\u2019t really in accordance with the characteristics of a historical painting that has survived for over a thousand years\u2026\u2026\u201dAnother person said, \u201cThe Gou family\u2019s\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300btruly has been pa.s.sed down through the generations. The seals are the best pieces of evidence for this. Though Mr. Shang\u2019s painting was expertly falsified, it\u2019s missing evidence in this regard. That\u2019s illogical\u2026\u2026\u201dGou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g revealed a pleased expression. \u201cDoes Mr. Shang not know how to make fake stamps?\u201dAt this time, Old Mr. w.a.n.g suddenly cried out in disbelief. \u201cWait a moment. Mr. Shang\u2019s painting seems to be authentic\u2026\u2026\u201dw.a.n.g Gezhi\u2019s words achieved the effect of a bomb. They instantly attracted everyone\u2019s attention. Someone yelped in surprise, \u201cThat can\u2019t be possible! Isn\u2019t the authentic painting in the Gou family\u2019s possession?\u201d\u201cThe Gou family\u2019s painting truly is authentic.\u201d w.a.n.g Gezhi seemed to be slightly bewildered too. \u201cB-but Mr. Shang\u2019s painting also looks to be authentic.\u201dHis words caused everyone present to become confused. \u201cIsn\u2019t that impossible? How could there be two authentic pieces?\u201dGou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g and Liu Ao\u2019s expressions simultaneously changed. Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g especially became very agitated. He pushed through the crowd and walked over. 's.h.i.+shu, even if you have a bad opinion of me, you shouldn\u2019t lie about this kind of stuff, right?\u201d\u201cWhen have I ever told half a lie regarding this topic?\u201d w.a.n.g Gezhi pushed him away. His attention had long since s.h.i.+fted away from Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g. He told Shen Wenrong, \u201cWenrong, bring me my tools. I\u2019m going to perform a live authentication.\u201dLiu Ao noticed that the scene was spiraling out of control. He knew that there was no other solution right now other than allowing a live authentication. Meng Hua had carefully planned today\u2019s press conference. Mishaps were absolutely not allowed to happen.Fortunately, the Gou family\u2019s\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300breally was authentic.Upon reaching this thought, he held Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g at bay and generously smiled at the media. \u201cI hadn\u2019t expected to be able to encounter such a situation today. Then, let\u2019s perform a live authentication for everyone right now. This way, everyone will be able to witness the prowess of our Meng Hua Auction House as well.\u201dAfter hearing the other\u2019s speech, Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g composed himself too. As expected from Liu Ao, someone who had many resources. He really did have a solution for everything. In only the blink of an eye, he had already changed this danger into an opportunity for showing off.Thus, he smiled too. \u201cExactly. Many experts are here today. This is the perfect opportunity to show everyone what a real antique is.\u201dBecause of Old Mr. w.a.n.g Gezhi\u2019s words, all the experts on site had started buzzing with excitement. By following the instructions of the event organizer, they started their work in an orderly manner.The media were very excited too. They had originally thought that this was only going to be a boring symposium. Unexpectedly, such a dramatic incident had occurred. Regardless of the results of authentication, the simple rise and fall of this plot was eye catching enough.This time, Meng Hua had truly placed serious investments into this event. The experts they had invited were all extremely famous authority figures in the industry. A crowd of people surrounded the painting Shang Que had brought out. All sorts of authentication tools got used. The scene could be compared to a study in a rocket science lab.The authentication process was slow and careful. The media, like the other guests, were waiting off to the side. Liu Ao was a detail-oriented host. He didn\u2019t forget to order the staff to diligently care for everyone.Everyone observed them, but Liu Ao and Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g truly seemed calm. After brief thought, though, this made sense. The Gou family\u2019s\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bwas incredibly famous. It absolutely couldn\u2019t be a counterfeit. It could only be said that the painting Shang Que had brought out was overly realistic. Old Mr. w.a.n.g was also a very serious person when it came to his profession. This was the only reason he was actually performing an authentication.However, there were several experts present. It was impossible for all of them to be wrong. The results of this authentication weren\u2019t that much of a mystery.Time ticked by slowly. After an unknown amount of time, the team of experts huddled together and shared a quiet conversation. Finally, someone got elected to be their representative. He walked out and said, \u201cThe results of the authentication have appeared.\u201dGou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g was unbothered. With a smile, he said, \u201cPlease be straightforward.\u201dThough Yu Zhengdu believed Shang Que, at this moment, he still couldn\u2019t help feeling a bit nervous. His heart was in his throat. The next moment, someone had already held onto his wrist. Yu Zhengdu\u2019s heart calmed down. He subconsciously started smiling.That expert\u2019s expression was solemn. \u201cAfter careful examination and discussion, we unanimously agree that Mr. Shang Que\u2019s\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bis authentic.\u201dEveryone became stunned.Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g shouted, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201dLiu Ao couldn\u2019t retain his composure either. Expression dark, he asked, \u201cHow is that possible? The authentic one is the one belonging to the Gou family!\u201dThe expert glanced at the two of them. Though their team of experts had been invited by Meng Hua, they weren\u2019t under Meng Hua\u2019s control. They had their own professionalism and adherences. Because of this, he ignored Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g and Liu Ao\u2019s questions and instead patiently relayed their process of authentication in detail.Authentication for antique paintings required a lot of knowledge. The authenticators needed to know the artist\u2019s names and t.i.tles, place of birth, and birth and death dates. They also needed to be thoroughly educated in history. Additionally, knowledge about materials, mounting technique, etc. could be used for authentication.The team of experts had been exceptionally careful during this authentication. They had practically considered all possible factors. However, the final result still caused them extreme astonishment.The\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bthat Shang Que had taken out really and truly used paper from the Song Dynasty. All other details showed no signs of falsification either. After eliminating the possibility of counterfeiting, there was only one conclusion left.This painting was the real deal.The media present didn\u2019t understand antique identification. However, they could understand what the expert was saying. The expert didn\u2019t speak too quickly. Point by point, in extreme detail, he relayed their findings. With each new sentence he spoke, Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g and Liu Ao\u2019s expressions became darker.\u201c\u2026\u2026The aforementioned was the process of our authentication. From the results, Mr. Shang Que\u2019s\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300btruly is authentic,\u201d the expert explained.\u201cA load of bulls.h.i.+t,\u201d Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g said while pointing at the expert. \u201cIf his is authentic, does that mean the Gou family\u2019s is counterfeit?\u201dw.a.n.g Gezhi stepped forward. \u201cThe\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bin the Gou family\u2019s possession is real. I authenticated it in the past too.\u201dGou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g scoffed. 's.h.i.+shu, could it be that you\u2019re trying to say that there are two copies of\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bin this world?\u201d\u201cRight now, we\u2019re also unclear about what\u2019s going on. The only thing we can do at this time is to put the two paintings together and do another comparative authentication,\u201d w.a.n.g Gezhi said.At this point, Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g had no other options.Thus, with the media witnessing everything, the two\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bpaintings got placed together.When they had been separate, there had been no noticeable difference. But when placed together, everyone finally realized that though the two paintings were very similar, there were also some slight variances between them. It was unsure if this was an illusion, but the painting in the Gou family\u2019s possession just seemed to be slightly less impressive in terms of the overall feeling given off.\u201cUh, these two characters are different.\u201d Yu Zhengdu had keen eyes. He instantly discovered the main difference between the two paintings. Aside from the fact that the Gou family\u2019s painting contained a few extra seals, there was a slight difference between the inscriptions on the two paintings as well.As soon as he said this, everyone else noticed too. Aside from containing a painting,\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300balso contained a poem inscribed by Qu Lanzhi himself. Juxtaposed, it was instantly noticeable that the painting belonging to the Gou family contained a \u201c tuan \u201d whereas the character used in Shang Que\u2019s painting was a \u201cwan\u201d. Additionally, the Gou family\u2019s \u201ctuan\u201d character also bore signs that it had been altered before.This discovery garnered everybody\u2019s immediate interest. They read through both poems separately.w.a.n.g Gezhi started pondering. \u201cSpeaking of, in the early years, s.h.i.+xiong and I had a discussion about this \u2018tuan\u2019 character too. The original poem really did use the \u2018wan\u2019 character instead.\u201dShu Yujing asked, \u201cAs such, this means that the \u201cwan\u201d character used in Mr. Shang Que\u2019s painting is the correct one. So his painting is the real one?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not how we draw conclusions,\u201d w.a.n.g Gezhi said.\u201cHaha, see, you guys don\u2019t know, right?\u201d Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g had been born in a family of antique collectors. He naturally understood antique identification too. He instantly chuckled, pleased. \u201cThis just so happens to prove that the painting in the Gou family\u2019s possession is the real one.\u201dShu Yujing didn\u2019t understand. \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cAs everyone knows,\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bwas one of Qu Lanzhi\u2019s earlier works. At the time, his calligraphy skills had not yet stabilized. Occasionally, he would make errors in his writings. Additionally, this painting originally had a description. The poem written on the painting had been done while Qu Lanzhi had been testing his chicken feather brush . This \u2018tuan\u2019 character shows signs of being altered because the wrong character had probably been written at first. Thus, he could only try to make the best of his mistake. If this were an imitation piece, they definitely wouldn\u2019t have left such an obvious flaw. The \u2018wan\u2019 character on Mr. Shang\u2019s painting, though, is perfect. Isn\u2019t the fact that they changed the wrong character to the right one in this painting the evidence needed to prove that it was created after the original?\u201dAs soon as Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g said this, everyone was struck with realization. They turned their gazes onto the team of experts. w.a.n.g Gezhi nodded. \u201cSometimes, counterfeits truly do seem to be more flawless than the real piece\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThat isn\u2019t a wrong character,\u201d Shang Que suddenly interrupted.w.a.n.g Gezhi paused. He looked towards Shang Que. \u201cMr. Shang, what did you say?\u201dShang Que stared at the \u201ctuan\u201d character on the Gou family\u2019s painting and calmly explained, \u201cThe \u2018wan\u2019 character sounds similar to the \u2018huan\u2019 in Zhao Huan , Emperor Qinzong\u2019s personal name. After the start of the Southern Song Dynasty, the common people mostly avoided using it, often using other characters to replace \u2018wan.\u2019\u201dAs soon as Shang Que said this, everyone present fell into a daze.Yu Zhengdu had an instinct. He pulled out his phone and looked up Qu Lanzhi\u2019s birth and death dates. He announced, \u201cQu Lanzhi pa.s.sed away in the year 1115. This was 11 years prior to Song Qinzong\u2019s Jingkang Era , which started in 1126. It would\u2019ve been impossible for him to start avoiding Qinzong\u2019s name in advance.\u201dThis painting belonging to the Gou family could truly be proven to have dated from the Song Dynasty, whether it be from material, mounting, stamping, etc. As such, n.o.body had ever suspected that there was something wrong with the time period. Because the \u201ctuan\u201d character on the painting bore signs of being altered, in addition to the fact that Qu Lanzhi\u2019s calligraphy skills truly hadn\u2019t been stable in the early stages, everyone had always thought that he had just written the wrong thing.Plus, there were only a handful of people who could lay eyes on this painting. Those qualified to authenticate it were even more rare. Moreover, a second\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bhad never appeared in public. As such, for several hundred years, this painting belonging to the Gou family had been believed to be authentic.But right now, another\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bhad appeared. Shang Que\u2019s words had also created a new possible theory.If the \u201ctuan\u201d character on the Gou family\u2019s painting wasn\u2019t a wrong character and was instead an attempt at avoiding the emperor\u2019s name, then everything could be explained. The character bore signs of being changed. If the wrong character had been written, then the right character should\u2019ve replaced it after scratching out the wrong word. However, the character on the painting was still wrong. Then, it was very likely that this wasn\u2019t because they had changed a wrong word. Instead, they had altered the originally correct \u201cwan\u201d character into something else.The fact that they avoided Emperor Qinzong\u2019s name meant that this was definitely a piece created during the Southern Song. This was also why the painting in the Gou family\u2019s possession didn\u2019t appear problematic at all in regards to materials, mounting, etc. This was because the painting truly was from the Southern Song. However, it simply hadn\u2019t been painted by Qu Lanzhi.There was a history scholar present who specialized in researching historical taboos. After brief consideration, he agreed with Shang Que\u2019s explanation. \u201cYou\u2019re right. During Emperor Qinzong\u2019s rule, many public writings truly avoided using the \u2018wan\u2019 character. Among all the other characters, \u2018tuan\u2019 was used most often to replace it.\u201dThe scholar\u2019s confirmation basically sentenced Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g to death. Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g started shouting, \u201cImpossible! This is impossible! This is only a guess you guys have.\u201dBut by now, his struggle was already meaningless.The authenticity of the two paintings was hard to determine. Under the circ.u.mstances where many different methods couldn\u2019t provide a definitive answer, it was naturally the painting that was more logical that seemed more compelling.Shang Que\u2019s reasoning was undoubtedly more convincing.Additionally, when these two paintings got placed next to each other, Shang Que\u2019s painting obviously had more spirit. Even without the problem with the character, the Gou family\u2019s painting probably wouldn\u2019t be able to completely impress everyone anyways.\u201cTruly unexpected . Unexpected,\u201d w.a.n.g Gezhi muttered. Everything had progressed in a manner completely surpa.s.sing his wildest expectations.Liu Ao hadn\u2019t expected for things to go down this path. Though these were only guesses that couldn\u2019t be absolutely confirmed, given such a situation, the Gou family\u2019s\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bobviously could no longer become Meng Hua\u2019s \u201crepresentative piece.\u201dHe had come here while bearing the burden of many resources. No matter what, he couldn\u2019t allow this plan to fail in his hands. In only a brief moment, he had already come up with a new idea. He instantly whispered something to his old friend, the wealthiest businessman in the capital, Zhan Wei. He wanted Zhan Wei to help him test Shang Que\u2019s att.i.tude.Zhan Wei had secret collaborations with Meng Hua. This time, he had come with the intention of helping Meng Hua. He instantly agreed to this request and walked forward to greet Shang Que. He cheerily said, \u201cI never thought that Mr. Shang would own a\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300btoo. Though there\u2019s still an ongoing debate between your version and the Gou family\u2019s version, I\u2019m not the type to be so restrained. I wonder if Mr. Shang is interested in selling? If you\u2019re willing to part with your treasure, I can give you this amount.\u201dHe held up one finger. One hundred million. This was the original starting price that Meng Hua had placed on the Gou family\u2019s painting. Given that the debate between the two paintings still hadn\u2019t ended, this asking price could be considered extremely sincere.Shang Que glanced at his finger. Apathetically, he stated, \u201cNot selling.\u201dZhan Wei was in slight disbelief. According to the information they had gathered previously, Shang Que was merely an Internet celebrity. He also only owned a small company. It was impossible that he wouldn\u2019t feel tempted by this price.He thought that Shang Que didn\u2019t understand what he meant. He couldn\u2019t help reminding, \u201cMr. Shang, I\u2019m offering a hundred million.\u201dBefore Shang Que could react, though, Yu Zhengdu had already gasped in shock. He held onto Shang Que\u2019s arm, a dreamlike expression on his face. \u201cBoss, that\u2019s a hundred million! One hundred million!!\u201dHe was actually only lamenting about the price in jest. This was the first time in his life he was hearing about a real amount of one hundred million. He couldn\u2019t help reverting to his ident.i.ty of an ordinary commoner.\u201cYou want it?\u201d However, Shang Que thought he was being serious. He looked at Yu Zhengdu, rolled up the painting, and stuffed it into the other\u2019s arms. \u201cThen I\u2019ll give it to you. You can sell it.\u201dZhan Wei:Yu Zhengdu:<b>The author has something to say:</b>Xiaokui: Lighting up the domineering boss skill!Zhengdu: \u2026\u2026My rich-a.s.s Boss!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Both these situations were common in their circle. There were plenty of ways to deal with them.He had never expected that Shang Que, who had rejected him so quickly just moments earlier, would turn around and offhandedly give the painting to his employee.Zhan Wei\u2019s friends were either rich or wealthy. It wasn\u2019t like he had never met any generous gift givers. However, he honestly hadn\u2019t met anyone as generous as Shang Que before.A famous painting worth one hundred million, gifted away just like that. He hadn\u2019t even blinked.Temporarily, Zhan Wei, who personally believed himself to be very experienced, felt shocked out of his mind. He actually couldn\u2019t manage to speak for a moment.Yu Zhengdu was astonished too. He thought of that set of rabbit fur black glaze tea cups that his family had previously accepted. That set of tea cups had resulted in him never daring to mention quitting again. He\u2019d probably have to work for Luofeng for the rest of his life. If he accepted this painting too, he would most likely end up having to be their company\u2019s horse and cow for his next three lifetimes. And he was talking about a real horse and a real cow.His expression became serious. He solemnly pushed the painting back. \u201cBoss, you\u2019re too polite. This painting is too precious. I can\u2019t accept it.\u201dShang Que furrowed his brows. \u201cHow is it precious? It\u2019s just a painting.\u201dZhan Wei: \u2026\u2026Fortunately, because of Shang Que\u2019s stern att.i.tude and his refusal to accept any interviews, the media couldn\u2019t get any information out of him. Thus, they could only disperse and head off to interview the experts and event organizer. Otherwise, Yu Zhengdu felt like he and Shang Que would probably already have ended up on the headlines by now.Even so, because he was the owner of\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300b, there were still several people who subtly observed Shang Que.Among them, there was also a media representative who had somewhat gossipy tendencies. They refused to admit defeat and kept staring at Shang Que. As soon as they saw Shang Que\u2019s actions, they instantly smelled a possible breaking news story. The little reporter turned his cameraman around and made to charge over.It was a good thing that Yu Zhengdu had been on high alert too. He didn\u2019t want to end up on the news at all. Upon noticing this situation, he instantly grabbed Shang Que and ran away.The little reporter failed in capturing these two. With no other options, he could only start interviewing Zhan Wei. \u201cMr. Zhan, may I ask what you were discussing with Mr. Shang just now?\u201dBy now, Zhan Wei had already come back to his senses. The more he thought about it, the more he felt like he had been tricked. That Shang Que was definitely acting with his employee so he could pretend to be more impressive. How much was his total net worth? Gifting a famous painting worth one hundred million just like that? Even the wealthiest man wasn\u2019t so generous!Zhan Wei was incredibly angry. Thus, he came up with a plan to lay a trap for Shang Que. He lowered his voice and laughed coldly, then said to the reporter, \u201cHe just said that he\u2019s going to give\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bto his employee.\u201dThe reporter\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cReally?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Zhan Wei scoffed. \u201cAm I the type to lie?\u201dThat reporter instantly revealed an expression that read This was exactly the effect Zhan Wei wanted to achieve. Gossipy reporters absolutely wouldn\u2019t miss out on a big story like this one. Shang Que had already forced himself into such a position by pretending to be more impressive than he really was. If, later, he couldn\u2019t bear to part with his painting in front of the media, the media would be capable of completely ruining his image. By the time the articles got published, Shang Que would certainly become a laughingstock.Yu Zhengdu pulled Shang Que to a place that no one was paying attention to before solemnly handing the painting back. \u201cBoss, I really can\u2019t accept this.\u201dShang Que: \u201cDidn\u2019t you want to sell it?\u201dYu Zhengdu really didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. \u201cI was only joking.\u201dShang Que pressed his lips together. \u201cBut when I said I was going to give it to you, I was being serious.\u201dYu Zhengdu froze for a moment. Then, he looked at Shang Que, slightly exasperated. \u201cWhy are you so determined to give me such an expensive gift?\u201d\u201cWhy are there so many whys?\u201d Shang Que turned away. \u201cI just want to give it away. Isn\u2019t that okay?\u201d\u201cOf course not. I\u2019m not such a casual person,\u201d Yu Zhengdu replied. \u201cIf you don\u2019t give me a reason, I won\u2019t accept it.\u201dShang Que\u2019s eyes twinkled. He thought for a moment and tentatively asked, \u201cOvertime pay?\u201dYu Zhengdu rolled his eyes in rejection. \u201cDo you think that reason\u2019s logical?\u201dShang Que held his chin up and puffed his chest out. \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cTo me, it\u2019s not logical.\u201d Yu Zhengdu crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cPlease try and respect my intelligence.\u201dShang Que fell into a bout of silence.Just as the two of them were in the middle of their stare-off, Shen Wenrong located them. \u201cI\u2019ve finally found you guys. Mr. Shang, can I trouble you to head over to the rest lounge in the back? My teacher wants to have a private conversation with you.\u201dYu Zhengdu still felt rather respectful towards Old Mr. w.a.n.g Gezhi. He guessed that the Gou family\u2019s\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bbeing a counterfeit was probably a hard hit for the other to take. Thus, he gently tugged at Shang Que. \u201cLet\u2019s go?\u201dShang Que had never cared about other people\u2019s opinions. But now that Yu Zhengdu had spoken up, he didn\u2019t reject this offer. He hummed in acknowledgement and followed Shen Wenrong to the rest lounge in the back.High-end convention centers were all pretty good at maintaining their customers\u2019 privacy. Though there were a lot of guests, as long as the main event organizer didn\u2019t give permission, most people wouldn\u2019t be allowed inside the rest area.Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que were guided into the hallway outside the rest area by Shen Wenrong. The surrounding environment instantly quieted quite a bit.\u201cHe\u2019s over here\u2026\u2026\u201d Shen Wenrong stopped outside a room. Just as he was about to open the door, a nearby door suddenly swung open. Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g pulled w.a.n.g Gezhi out. 's.h.i.+shu, I truly apologize for this, but can you please leave immediately?\u201dw.a.n.g Gezhi pointed at him and said, \u201cYou b.a.s.t.a.r.d. Y-you think I don\u2019t know what you and Meng Hua want to do?\u201d\u201cSince you know, you should also know that I\u2019m doing all of this for the Gou family.\u201d Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g lowered his voice and coldly stated, \u201cIf we\u2019re really laying blame, you have to take responsibility. If not for you and your student inviting some uncultured Internet celebrity here, ruining the reputation of our Gou family\u2019s\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300b, I wouldn\u2019t have to take this step.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s real cannot be made fake. What\u2019s fake cannot be made real. This is the basic rule that us antique authenticators must follow,\u201d w.a.n.g Gezhi replied angrily. \u201cIf s.h.i.+xiong were still alive, he would agree with my actions too.\u201d\u201cI know, I know,\u201d Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g said impatiently. \u201cI won\u2019t get in the way of your basic rules, but can you not get in my way either?\u201dw.a.n.g Gezhi: \u201cI absolutely refuse to watch on and do nothing as you use the Gou family\u2019s acc.u.mulated reputation for your own selfish desires.\u201dTheir argument got more and more heated. Shen Wenrong had a bad feeling in his stomach. He hurriedly walked forward and helped hold the old man upright. \u201cTeacher, are you okay?\u201dShang Que and Yu Zhengdu made eye contact. They followed.\u201cI-I\u2026\u2026\u201d w.a.n.g Gezhi held onto his chest. He couldn\u2019t even form an entire sentence anymore.\u201cYou\u2019re here just in time. Hurry and take your teacher away. Don\u2019t get in the way of our official business.\u201d Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g had gotten used to giving orders. He showed his true colors to Shen Wenrong as well.\u201cI\u2019m not leaving!\u201d w.a.n.g Gezhi had finally recovered. He stood there, stubborn. \u201cI want to see what other blasphemous things you\u2019re capable of!!\u201d\u201cWhy bother, s.h.i.+shu. It\u2019s not like you can stop me.\u201d There were no outsiders present. Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g\u2019s att.i.tude became even more impolite. \u201cDon\u2019t anger yourself into sickness when anything happens.\u201dJust as he was speaking, he noticed that Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que had arrived too. His expression instantly changed. \u201cWhat are you two doing here? Hurry and leave.\u201d\u201cNo no no, don\u2019t say that. Mr. Shang is our valued guest too.\u201d Liu Ao, who had previously been blocking the entrance to the rest lounge and coldly watching the drama unfold, suddenly revealed a charming smile. He walked over. \u201cCome in and sit. This is the perfect opportunity to show Mr. Shang the prowess of our Meng Hua Auction House.\u201dGou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g immediately realized what was going on after noticing Liu Ao\u2019s change in att.i.tude. Just now, Zhan Wei had angrily returned and cussed Shang Que out. Clearly, though, Liu Ao still hadn\u2019t given up on the\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bin Shang Que\u2019s possession.Liu Ao\u2019s behavior was very easy to understand. Though there was still uncertainty about which version of\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bwas real, it was obvious that as of now, Shang Que\u2019s version was more accepted as authentic. In actuality, how could they themselves not understand that it was much more likely for Shang Que\u2019s version to be real? Otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t have told Zhan Wei to use one hundred million to test the other. Only, they wouldn\u2019t admit this until the last possible moment.Taking a step back, even if a conclusion ultimately couldn\u2019t be reached about the two paintings, if Meng Hua could obtain Shang Que\u2019s version as well, then it wouldn\u2019t matter which was real or fake anymore. Auctioning both versions off together would definitely make history.Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g naturally wasn\u2019t willing to admit defeat. However, he and Meng Hua were already tied together. No matter how unwilling he was, he could only force himself to swallow his anger. He coldly said, \u201cThen come in and gain knowledge with us.\u201dYu Zhengdu didn\u2019t understand why they had changed their minds, but he figured that these people wouldn\u2019t give up so easily after such a great failure. Additionally, Old Mr. w.a.n.g refused to leave. Yu Zhengdu was also worried that something would happen to him. Thus, he calmly smiled and slowly walked forward while tugging Shang Que along. \u201cThen we\u2019ll take a look.\u201dThe rest lounge next door was very big. It also contained an enormous floor to ceiling window. Obviously, only VIP guests could use this area. The people sitting inside were also truly VIPs.Aside from Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g, Liu Ao and Zhan Wei were inside too. Moreover, there were several experts who had been part of the authentication team and a few individuals who looked to be of very high status. The only two official media representatives were present as well.\u201cEveryone, a new honored guest has arrived. I hope n.o.body minds,\u201d Liu Ao introduced.The people inside had originally been slightly displeased because of the sudden newcomer, but upon seeing that this person was the owner of\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300b, their displeasure instantly disappeared.One person among them even started clapping. \u201cThey\u2019re extremely welcome.\u201dYu Zhengdu knew what was going on as soon as he saw this scene. As expected, right after he and Shang Que entered the rest lounge, Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g\u2019s a.s.sistant shut the door. Then, a worker nearby opened a briefcase safe and carefully pulled out a cla.s.sy, ornate wooden box from it.Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g glared hatefully at Shang Que before turning his gaze onto the high-status guests and two official media representatives. With a smile, he said, \u201cEveryone, the Gou family has great faith in Meng Hua Auction House\u2019s prowess. We also trust their professionalism greatly\u2026\u2026\u201dHe paused for a moment in order to appear very nonchalant. \u201cAs everyone knows, aside from\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300b, the Gou family is also in possession of several other artifacts from the two Song Dynasties. To tell the truth, after performing a thorough investigation of Meng Hua Auction House, I have decided to turn the remaining collectibles belonging to the Gou family over to Meng Hua as well.\u201dAs soon as he heard this, Yu Zhengdu finally understood why w.a.n.g Gezhi was so furious. So it turned out that\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bwasn\u2019t the only thing Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g was intending on selling.However, what they didn\u2019t know was, Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g had actually been forced into doing this.Originally, his and Liu Ao\u2019s plan hadn\u2019t involved using the Gou family\u2019s other collectibles so soon. Instead, they had planned to first use the rare ancient painting,\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300b, as a stepping stone. This would instantly guarantee Meng Hua Auction House\u2019s status in the auctioning world. After, they\u2019d then collaborate with other collectors to completely control the market. By then, the pricing for the entire market would be dependent on them. These collectibles belonging to the Gou family would truly be sold for a hundred times their value.Only, even after considering an innumerous number of possibilities, they hadn\u2019t expected to fail at this impeccable step with\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300b. Forget instant fame \u2013 they almost instantly ruined Meng Hua and the Gou family\u2019s reputations.It was fortunate that the team of experts had all expressed that it was difficult to tell which painting was authentic. It wasn\u2019t the Gou family or Meng Hua\u2019s fault that they had treated\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bas the real deal. Otherwise, they would truly be beyond help now. The only thing they could do at this time was use the Gou family\u2019s other collectibles earlier than planned. This way, they could try and redeem themselves.This time, Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g and Liu Ao were much more careful. They only invited the most important guests and the two official reporters into the rest lounge. They were preparing to first allow these people to see the goods. Then, they\u2019d spend money asking the other reporters to follow this news story. Unexpectedly, they happened to get seen by Old Mr. w.a.n.g. Another incident almost occurred.It was a good thing that Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g wasn\u2019t scared this time either. The Gou family was a true generational family. The Song artifact collectors in the country whose collections could be compared to the Gou family\u2019s were able to be counted on one hand. This Internet celebrity definitely wasn\u2019t among this group. \u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bhad only been an accident. He now wanted to show Shang Que what a true family collection looked like.Under everyone\u2019s antic.i.p.atory gazes, Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g put on his gloves and carefully pulled a little tray covered in satin out from the wooden box. \u201cEveryone should know that Jingkang Tongbaos are among the fifty most precious types of ancient coinage. Currently, there are less than thirty little Jingkang Tongbao coins remaining, and our Gou family happens to own a pair of little duiqian .\u201dTwo ancient coins rested on the small tray.The guests present were either famous collectors or wealthy businessmen who could afford to spend enormous amounts of money on these artifacts. They all understood the field. As such, after hearing Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g\u2019s words, they all became alert. Some even subconsciously sighed in awe.But Yu Zhengdu didn\u2019t understand these things. He could only turn to look at Shang Que. Shang Que then turned to look at Shen Wenrong.In a low voice, Shen Wenrong very tactfully gave them an explanation.The supposed fifty most precious types of ancient coinage referred to fifty very precious types of coinage that had appeared across Huaxia history. Many of these coins were either completely gone or only had one surviving specimen left. As such, they were priceless and very valuable collectibles.Additionally, coins produced in the two Song Dynasties made up a majority of the fifty precious types. The Jingkang Tongbaos Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g had taken out belonged in this category.Jingkang Tongbaos had been minted during Song Qinzong\u2019s rule in the Northern Song Dynasty. Due to the fact that Song Qinzong had gotten kidnapped after a mere sixteen months on the throne, there were very few coins inscribed with the name \u201cJingkang Era.\u201d Additionally, little Jingkang Tongbao coins were a very rare type of coin.The little duiqian that Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g had taken out were also the rarest of the rare.Little coins were worth one . They were the smallest currency unit in the age of copper coins. Duiqian were two coins from the same era. Their size, thickness, material, edges, and holes were completely identical. Only the style of calligraphy used for their inscriptions were different. They were also called \u201ca pair of coins.\u201dJingkang Tongbaos became paired together when one was inscribed in seal script while the other was inscribed in regular script.The Gou family\u2019s pair of Jingkang Tongbaos was exactly this rare pairing: one little coin inscribed with seal script and one little coin inscribed with regular script.Off to the side, w.a.n.g Gezhi was outraged. \u201cLittle Jingkang Tongbao coins are grade-one cultural relics ! There are only a dozen surviving specimens. How could you auction these off?\u201dHowever, the ones invited into this rest lounge were all important potential customers that Meng Hua had gotten in contact with earlier. These people had come here with the goal of obtaining the Gou family\u2019s collectibles. Why would they care about w.a.n.g Gezhi\u2019s att.i.tude?Among the customers was one who specially sought out rare ancient coins. At this time, he already couldn\u2019t control himself anymore. \u201cI\u2019ve long since heard that the Gou family owns a pair of little Jingkang Tongbao coins. I finally get to see them today. This trip wasn\u2019t for naught.\u201dLiu Ao cheerily said, \u201cCEO Liu, I told you before, Meng Hua\u2019s prowess is beyond all doubt. You know better than anyone how rare little Jingkang Tongbao coins are. Aside from Meng Hua, you won\u2019t be able to find another auction house on the market that can auction these off\u2026\u2026\u201dCEO Liu chuckled, \u201cNot bad, not bad\u2026\u2026\u201dWhile he spoke, he picked up the appraisal tools that Liu Ao had prepared in advance. Just as he was about to step forward, he heard Shang Que suddenly ask, \u201cAre Jingkang Tongbaos really rare?\u201dThere weren\u2019t that many people inside this rest lounge. As soon as Shang Que spoke, everyone heard him. The scene fell into silence.Upon noticing that it was him again, Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g instantly became outraged. He impolitely mocked, \u201cAren\u2019t you a Song history Weibo account owner? What, you don\u2019t even know if Jingkang Tongbaos are rare or not?\u201dShang Que fell deep into thought. \u201cNo.\u201dGou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g: \u201cNo matter what, you\u2019re still a mildly famous Internet celebrity. Don\u2019t think that you\u2019re on top of the world just because you own a\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300b. I urge you to learn more about the other artifacts of the Song Dynasty when you have the time.\u201dHe had finally found the opportunity to reestablish his dominance. He scoffed, \u201cHowever, rare ancient coins like Jingkang Tongbaos aren\u2019t things that you can see just because you want to.\u201dLiu Ao knew Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g was displeased in his heart. He hurriedly mediated, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine. Mr. Shang is here today too. You can learn with us. If you\u2019re interested, you can also collaborate with Meng Hua in the future\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cNot interested,\u201d Shang Que replied coldly. \u201cI have quite a lot in my possession.\u201dWhen he said this, the entire scene fell silent once more.Liu Ao suspected that he had misheard. \u201cMr. Shang, what did you say?\u201dYu Zhengdu glanced at Shang Que. He didn\u2019t know if it was because he had already gotten used to this, but he wasn\u2019t super shocked. He could even calmly ask Boss, \u201cYou have Jingkang Tongbaos?\u201dShang Que: \u201c .\u201dYu Zhengdu thought back to Shen Wenrong\u2019s mini lesson. Apparently, the Gou family\u2019s little copper coins were the rarest type. Thus, he asked, a little gossipy, \u201cAre they the little coins?\u201dShang Que thought about it. \u201cI have a bunch of random stuff. I don\u2019t know what I have either.\u201dShang Que\u2019s att.i.tude caused Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g and Liu Ao to slightly relax. According to what the other had said, it was possible that the coins he owned weren\u2019t authentic. Jingkang Tongbaos were such rare types of coins. Collectors counted each and every one in their possession carefully. Who would describe them as \u201ca bunch of random stuff\u201d?Of course, even if they were real, that wasn\u2019t a big deal. Though Jingkang Tongbaos were rare, there had always been people among the general public who owned them. The little Jingkang Tongbao coins were the truly rare ones.However, with the prior lesson drawn from\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300b, Liu Ao and Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g didn\u2019t dare to be careless. Liu Ao forced himself to act calm as he smiled and asked, \u201cI wonder if Mr. Shang has brought them along? Would you be willing to take them out and let us all look at them?\u201dShang Que glanced at Yu Zhengdu. Upon seeing that Yu Zhengdu\u2019s expression was curious too, he nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201dGou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou brought your ancient coins too?\u201dYu Zhengdu calmly explained in Boss\u2019s stead, \u201cWell, this is a discussion on Song history and our Boss is a very generous man. Thus, he wanted to bring all the stuff he had at home so everyone could discuss them together.\u201dAll the people present almost suffered facial spasms together\u2026\u2026Was this your normal \u201cgenerosity\u201d?With a smile on his face, Liu Ao said, \u201cDid Mr. Shang put his ancient coins in storage too? I\u2019ll have a worker grab them for you?\u201d\u201cNo need. I\u2019m carrying them with me,\u201d Shang Que answered. Then, he stuffed a hand into his pocket and pulled out a drawstring cloth bag \u2013 the type that was used in ancient times. The bag was very full, like it was holding a lot of coins.Thus, everyone fell silent once again.Then, they thought back on how he had treated\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300b. They all really wanted to ask: can you have at least a bit of respect for antique cultural relics?The answer was: no.Shang Que offhandedly threw this coin bag onto the table. \u201cGo ahead and look.\u201dThough everyone felt like they had almost suffered heart attacks because of his actions, Liu Ao still immediately organized the team of experts together. In front of everyone, they opened up the coin bag and poured out a small pile of coins. They started authenticating on the spot.w.a.n.g Gezhi, who had originally been extremely outraged at Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g\u2019s behavior, had forgotten his rage too. He grabbed his own authenticating tools and joined in on the live authentication.Immediately after, exclamations of shock sounded out in the rest lounge.\u201cThey really are Jingkang Tongbaos! These are little Jingkang Tongbao coins!\u201d\u201cThere are also Dasong Tongbaos!\u201d\u201cThis, this looks like a Yingyun Tongbao??\u201d\u201cThese really are ancient coins\u2026\u2026They\u2019re authentic. They\u2019re not falsified.\u201dFollowing the experts\u2019 sounds of surprise, Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g\u2019s expression became darker and darker.He had never expected that this Internet celebrity, who was completely unknown in the collector\u2019s circle, who didn\u2019t even have any generational wealth, would own so many ancient coins from the two Song Dynasties. Additionally, many of them were types that were currently very rare and precious.However, the true blow had yet to come.Only to hear w.a.n.g Gezhi suddenly shout out in disbelief, \u201cThis is, this is\u2014\u2014a Jianguo Tongbao?!!\u201dThis sentence achieved the same effect of a bomb blowing up. Everyone present simultaneously exclaimed, \u201cJianguo Tongbao?\u201dSong Huizong, personal name Zhao Ji, had named his reign the Jianzhong Jingguo Era. Thus, Jianguo Tongbaos had taken the first and last characters of the era name for use during coin inscriptions. However, because the characters \u201cJianzhong\u201d in the era name were a duplicate of the name of a certain Tang Dynasty era, this type of coin became annulled immediately after its production. As such, Jianguo Tongbaos were exceptionally rare and were known as the most precious coin type of the Northern Song Dynasty.According to research, no more than ten Jianguo Tongbaos had survived into modern times. They were priceless.\u201cThere are two Jianguo Tongbaos! Two!\u201d w.a.n.g Gezhi\u2019s voice sounded beyond excited.However, Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g only felt that his vision was going dark. While shaking, he turned to look at the two little coins belonging to the Gou family.In front of Shang Que\u2019s pile of ancient coins, only three words remained hanging over his two little copper coins\u2014\u2014Small. Pitiful. Helpless.Because of time restraints, the team of experts didn\u2019t actually manage to authenticate each individual coin belonging to Shang Que. They only authenticated the rarest ones in the pile. However, this was already enough.Real. All real.In the face of a true big collector of ancient coins, the Gou family\u2019s generational halo disappeared.The VIP guests present all started staring at Shang Que, gazes pa.s.sionate.Shang Que completely ignored them. Upon seeing that the team of experts had finished, he casually put the coins back into the bag and looked at Yu Zhengdu. \u201cWant them?\u201dYu Zhengdu hurriedly waved his hands. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201dShang Que was unbothered. He offhandedly stuffed the coin bag back into his pocket. It was unknown how his clothes had been designed \u2013 even though such a big bag of coins had been placed inside, the pocket surprisingly hadn\u2019t puffed up.Everyone watching felt like they were getting stabbed in the heart. w.a.n.g Gezhi couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cMr. Shang, gently! Be more gentle!\u201dShang Que: \u201cOh.\u201d Then, he continued in the same manner he had been.\u201cMr. Shang, this is my business card.\u201d Instantly, a collector handed his business card to Shang Que. \u201cLater, let\u2019s sit and have a chat together when you have the time.\u201dYu Zhengdu glanced at Shang Que and realized that he most likely was too lazy to bother with this man. He hurriedly stepped forward and cheerily exchanged business cards with him. \u201cOf course, not a big deal.\u201dWith this person leading by example, all the other VIP guests felt tempted as well. Liu Ao noticed that things were going downhill. If all these people got in contact with Shang Que, Meng Hua would truly be ruined. He hurriedly gave Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g a meaningful look, then loudly chuckled and said, \u201cMr. Shang really is a man who can\u2019t be judged by his appearance. From now on, please remember to collaborate a lot with our Meng Hua too. But let\u2019s not talk about this at this moment. Today, CEO Gou has also brought another collectible with him. It\u2019s something else that everyone is interested in. Let\u2019s look at this first.\u201dToday, Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g had brought three items with him in total. He had originally been planning on using\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bas the main product. This would become Meng Hua\u2019s \u201crepresentative piece.\u201d The following two artifacts would only be bait. They\u2019d be taken out so these professional collectors could look at them and feel tempted to buy them.As of now, though, not only had he been forced to play his last two cards earlier than intended, one of these cards had even been completely destroyed by Shang Que. Again.Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g\u2019s heart was already covered in blood. This was his last card. No matter what, he couldn\u2019t lose again.Liu Ao remained mindful. He first lowly asked Shang Que, \u201cMr. Shang, do you have any other items in storage?\u201dShang Que: \u201cNo.\u201dAfter receiving an affirmative answer, Liu Ao also scanned Shang Que up and down. He confirmed that the other couldn\u2019t possibly be hiding anything big on his person before relaxing and giving Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g a meaningful look.Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g heaved out a sigh of relief. He carefully pulled out the other item from the briefcase. \u201cThis is another Song Dynasty artifact the Gou family possesses: rabbit fur black glaze cup!\u201dOnly to hear the employee sitting next to Shang Que blurt out, \u201cI have that at home!\u201dEveryone looked over.Liu Ao instantly noticed that this was only Shang Que\u2019s employee. Confidently, he said with a smile, \u201cLittle brother, how could that be the same? The one you use at home was probably bought at the market. Meanwhile, this one has been pa.s.sed down from the Song Dynasty. There\u2019s a big difference.\u201dYu Zhengdu had only accidentally blurted that sentence out in a fit of excitement. Now that he realized what he had said, he felt a bit embarra.s.sed too. But since he had already said it, he couldn\u2019t take it back anymore. Thus, he replied, \u201cEy, no. The three we have at home are gifts from my Boss. They\u2019re from the Song Dynasty too.\u201dUpon hearing that they were gifts from Shang Que, everyone\u2019s eyes had already widened.A collector asked the question that was on everyone\u2019s minds. \u201cYou said you have\u2026\u2026three at home?\u201d\u201c ,\u201d Yu Zhengdu nodded. \u201cIt was originally a set of four, but someone broke one. Now there\u2019s only three.\u201dGou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g\u2019s vision went dark.<b>The author has something to say:</b>Zhengdu: Pretending to be bada.s.s with Boss!Xiaokui: What? I wasn\u2019t pretending to be bada.s.s, though? I was only being honest\u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Where am I? What am I doing?Qu Lanzhi\u2019s famous painting, the fifty precious types of ancient coinage, rabbit fur black glaze cups\u2026\u2026Why did these famed antiques, ones that could cause a stir in the entire collector circle when they appeared, seem like lettuce in this unimportant boss\u2019s hands? He could just casually pull out a whole bunch?Could they even be described as \u201crare and precious\u201d or \u201conce every thousand years\u201d anymore?Momentarily, all the professional collectors and wealthy businessmen couldn\u2019t help feeling a sense of bleakness\u2026\u2026In the face of Shang Que\u2019s collection, they \u2013 the supposed high-end collectors \u2013 now suddenly seemed a bit ridiculous.Fortunately, there were still some people who retained their logical reasoning. Because Zhan Wei had already conversed with Shang Que earlier and had witnessed him casually handing\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bto his employee in an attempt to seem more impressive, he had already formed his own opinion of the other in his heart.Gifting a set of rabbit fur black glaze cups his a.s.s. This was probably another act this pretentious little Internet celebrity CEO was putting on.Zhan Wei sneered. \u201cMr. Shang is truly so generous to his employees. Everybody knows how rare rabbit fur black glaze cups are. It\u2019s already extremely fortunate for someone to come across one. But Mr. Shang easily gave a whole set away. I wonder what your employee has done for the company to deserve such commendation?\u201dAs soon as Zhan Wei said this, the others in the room instantly came back to their senses too.In all honesty, given the way that Shang Que had so casually pulled out\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300band a pile of ancient coins previously, if he said that he owned a set of rabbit fur black glaze tea cups, everyone would believe this. However, he was saying that he had given this set of black glazed cups to his employee\u2026\u2026Sorry, but who among the attendees didn\u2019t own a few companies? They were all bosses. How could they not understand what kind of people bosses were?With this guess in their heart, everyone\u2019s gazes on Yu Zhengdu became very meaningful.This youth was either helping his boss bluff or had been completely fooled by his boss.Zhan Wei believed that he had been tricked by Shang Que earlier. He hadn\u2019t gotten over this yet; thus, he intended to make sure that Shang Que would embarra.s.s himself. He purposefully provoked Yu Zhengdu by asking, \u201cLittle buddy, why did your boss give you such an expensive gift?\u201dObviously because\u2026\u2026he had randomly wanted to.This was the explanation closest to the truth, but upon noticing the suspicious gazes all around him, Yu Zhengdu realized what was going on as well.In all honesty, he had truly only gotten over excited due to the continuous exciting plot twists just now. He wasn\u2019t a collector, nor was he planning on buying antiques. He wasn\u2019t determined to prove the items he owned were authentic. At this moment, there was also no way to prove this fact.\u201cThis\u2026\u2026\u201d Yu Zhengdu glanced at Shang Que. Upon seeing that the other was rather apathetic too, he casually responded, \u201cOh, that was overtime pay my boss gave me.\u201dHowever, he was also teasing Shang Que about the shoddy excuse he had just given to get Yu Zhengdu to accept the painting.How compet.i.tive was Shang Que? No matter what, he needed to admit things he had previously said. He instantly confidently lifted his head and puffed out his chest. \u201c , it was overtime pay.\u201dThe two of them were using this as an opportunity to make fun of each other. Neither were willing to admit defeat. In the ears of everyone else, though, this sounded like something else. The others all heaved out sighs of relief and revealed expressions that read .A ray of light suddenly brightened up Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g\u2019s dark world. Of course. Even if Shang Que really owned so many collectibles, it was impossible for him to casually give an extremely expensive rabbit fur black glaze tea cup to someone for no reason.Zhan Wei was the most pleased person in the room. He had been a rich man for so long \u2013 it was always he who showed off his wealth. There hadn\u2019t been a lot of people who had dared to try and act bada.s.s in front of him. He instantly burst into laughter. \u201cMr. Shang\u2019s company has such great benefits. Working overtime can result in a free set of rabbit fur black glaze cups. Makes me want to go work for you too.\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t do,\u201d Shang Que coldly said after scanning the top of the other\u2019s head. \u201cOur company doesn\u2019t hire people who don\u2019t have a lot of hair.\u201dBefore Zhan Wei even managed to finish mocking the other, he almost ended up spitting out a mouthful of blood.Zhan Wei, who had never been insulted in such a manner, was furious. Thus, he decided to humiliate Shang Que. Suddenly, the collector who had just exchanged business cards with Yu Zhengdu seemed to have discovered something. He asked, \u201cWait a moment. Little buddy, is your surname Yu?\u201dYu Zhengdu nodded. \u201cYes.\u201dThat person continued to ask, \u201cCould it be that you\u2019re from the Yu clan in Jintan Village of Shu City?\u201dYu Zhengdu was slightly surprised. Jintan Village was only an unimportant little village: the kind that people outside of Shu City didn\u2019t know about. He hadn\u2019t expected that this collector would know of Jintan Village too. He had even accurately named the Yu clan. Yu Zhengdu was confused, but still answered, \u201cI am. What\u2019s wrong?\u201dOnly to see that collector exclaim, \u201cThen your family really owns three rabbit fur black glaze cups!\u201dThis collector was somewhat famous among the collectors. He had prowess and techniques. He knew about everything that happened in this circle. As soon as he said this, someone instantly asked, \u201cWhat does that mean? What do you mean his family really owns three rabbit fur black glaze cups?\u201dThat person\u2019s expression was full of disbelief. However, he still explained to everyone else, \u201cSo this is what happened. At the beginning of the year, I received news that three rabbit fur black glaze tea cups appeared in a place called Jintan Village in Shu City.\u201dRabbit fur black glaze tea cups were very rare ceramic pieces. At the time, quite a lot of people had found out that the Yu family owned these antiques. Even though Yu Zhengdu\u2019s parents tried to remain lowkey, this news still got out. To the average person, this wasn\u2019t too important. For example, the occupants of Jintan Village. They only treated this as gossip and talked about it for a short while. Later on, people slowly stopped bringing it up.To those seriously invested in collecting antiques, though, this was truly breaking news. It was fortunate that Jintan Village was honestly too inaccessible. This news didn\u2019t end up spreading too far. However, the distance that it did spread was more than enough for this collector who had lots of connections to find out.Others all knew that this person\u2019s information was always reliable. Even so, upon hearing this, they still couldn\u2019t help asking in disbelief, \u201cReally?\u201d\u201cNaturally,\u201d the collector answered.At first, the wealthiest man in the Yu clan, Yu Manjiang, had broken one of the rabbit fur black glaze tea cups in the set. Thus, he had needed to compensate Yu Zhengdu\u2019s family for it. To be fair, Yu Zhengdu and them had sent the rabbit fur black glaze tea cups to a formal appraisal unit for authentication. This collector often communicated with many of these appraisal units in Huaxia. This was how he had learned of this news.It was a slight pity that eventually, Yu Zhengdu\u2019s parents had directly given that set of rabbit fur black glaze tea cups to a trusted service for safekeeping because they didn\u2019t want to worry too much. Additionally, they politely rejected any guests who were there to see the rabbit fur black glaze tea cups. In the end, this collector failed to see those three legendary black glazed cups.However, he had gotten a clear understanding of this story from Jintan Village.Not only did he know that the Yu family really owned three rabbit fur black glaze cups, he also knew that those three rabbit fur black glaze cups had truly been gifted to the Yu family by their son\u2019s boss.After hearing the collector\u2019s thorough explanation, everyone present honestly couldn\u2019t say anything anymore.Especially Zhan Wei, who had originally thought that Shang Que was merely bluffing. Right now, his face became deathly pale. He felt like the worldview he had held for the first half of his life had gotten shattered.Compared to Shang Que, the Gou family\u2019s halo no longer existed. The collectibles that Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g had brought instantly became much less valuable.The VIP guests present no longer cared about the event organizers. They instantly walked up to Shang Que to exchange business cards with him.Shang Que had initially been quite impatient, but just now, Yu Zhengdu had found an opportunity to send him a signal: these guests were all wealthy businessmen here in the capital. In the future, they might be able to become their company\u2019s clients. Shang Que finally managed to reluctantly gather the energy for social interaction after realizing this could relate to their company\u2019s sales.Someone tentatively asked, \u201cMr. Shang, are you interested in selling the two Jianguo Tongbaos you own? I\u2019m open to any price.\u201dShang Que immediately rejected, \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cHow about the little Jingkang Tongbao coins?\u201d\u201cNot for sale.\u201dShang Que accepted any and all business cards. Yet, if anyone mentioned the Song Dynasty artifacts he owned, he rejected them very quickly.Thus, someone inquired, confused, \u201cI heard that Mr. Shang\u2019s company is still in the developmental phase. I a.s.sume you must need a lot of funds. You own so many collectibles anyways. Wouldn\u2019t it be pretty convenient to choose a random one or two to sell off?\u201dEveryone else had the same question. Given the fact that Shang Que was capable of offhandedly giving his employee a set of black glazed cups and given his casual att.i.tude regarding his collectibles, they honestly didn\u2019t feel like he treasured them very much. Why was he refusing to just sell one or two?\u201cWhy would I sell them?\u201d Shang Que was very confused too. \u201cOnly prodigal sons sell off their family possessions.\u201dAt this time, everyone was looking at him. Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g was too. As soon as Shang Que said this, everyone immediately revealed meaningful expressions.Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g had originally already felt quite embarra.s.sed. Now, he felt like his face was heating up even more. He almost wanted to slam the door on the spot and leave.Yu Zhengdu couldn\u2019t help going \u201cpft\u2014\u2014\u201d to himself either. Given his understanding of Shang Que, Boss definitely didn\u2019t care about Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g at all. He had merely been telling the truth. Only, he hadn\u2019t realized that he would be coincidentally stabbing Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g with his words.But to Liu Ao, Shang Que\u2019s unrelenting rejections were a good thing. After Shang Que took out so many authentic Song Dynasty antiques, the Gou family\u2019s collection had already completely lost this compet.i.tion. If Shang Que agreed to sell anything, this would be catastrophic for both the Gou family and Meng Hua.Liu Ao sighed in relief to himself. He hurriedly ordered everyone to disperse, quickly ending this private antique appreciation session.By now, everyone already knew that they had definitely completely failed in accomplis.h.i.+ng today\u2019s original goal. Antiques were all about rareness. After Shang Que\u2019s collection became revealed, the items in the Gou family\u2019s possession definitely needed to be revalued. n.o.body would dare to carelessly act again today.Even though everyone else had left, Yu Zhengdu still remembered their initial purpose in entering the rest area. He looked over at w.a.n.g Gezhi and said with a smile, \u201cOld mister, let\u2019s go back and continue our conversation?\u201dw.a.n.g Gezhi nodded. With Shen Wenrong\u2019s help, he, Yu Zhengdu, and Shang Que left the VIP rest lounge together.Unexpectedly, as soon as they exited the rest lounge, a reporter and cameraman suddenly darted out from nearby. Yu Zhengdu saw him and realized \u2013 wasn\u2019t this the gossip reporter who had been staring at him and Shang Que earlier? He reacted impossibly quickly. Yu Zhengdu immediately grabbed Shang Que and charged into the break room next door. Then, he closed the door.The reporter who hadn\u2019t had time to do anything at all: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe refused to give up. Fortunately, another group of people had exited from that room as well. Among them was Zhan Wei. The reporter instantly scooted up close to interview Zhan Wei. \u201cMr. Zhan, can I trouble you to relay the details of Mr. Shang giving his employee the painting one more time?\u201dZhan Wei\u2019s expression darkened. Right now, he didn\u2019t want to say anything at all!Earlier, he had thought that Shang Que was faking it, which was why he had purposefully laid a trap for the other in front of the reporter. Who f.u.c.king knew that Shang Que was capable of really giving antiques to his employee?!However, even though he wasn\u2019t saying anything, someone had already b.u.t.ted in from the side. \u201cMr. Shang is honestly so generous to his employee. Gifting an antique just like that!\u201dUpon hearing this, the reporter realized this story was true. He became even more excited. \u201cDo you know why Mr. Shang gave his employee such a valuable item?\u201dThe surrounding individuals fell silent. Finally, someone spoke up. \u201cApparently\u2026\u2026it was overtime pay.\u201dYu Zhengdu and Shang Que waited in the break room for a little bit before Old Mr. w.a.n.g and Shen Wenrong entered as well. Just as they were about to start conversing, an uninvited guest walked in too.w.a.n.g Gezhi\u2019s expression darkened. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201dLiu Ao ignored him. He handed Shang Que a business card without being asked to. With an ingratiating smile on his face, he said, \u201cMr. Shang is truly someone of exemplary character and sharp integrity. I\u2019m very impressed. However, I suspect that you might not know how much the objects in your possession are worth. Given the chance, why not come to our Meng Hua Auction House for a chat? I trust that our Meng Hua will definitely be able to give you a tempting enough proposal.\u201dw.a.n.g Gezhi almost started a fight on the spot. \u201cWhat, it\u2019s not enough that you already dragged Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g under? Now you want to drag Mr. Shang under too?\u201dLiu Ao said, 's.h.i.+shu, if you yourself want to be aloof, n.o.body\u2019s going to stop you. But don\u2019t prevent Mr. Shang from making a fortune.\u201dw.a.n.g Gezhi: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with making a fortune. But you need to do so morally!\u201dHe turned to look at Shang Que and pleaded, \u201cMr. Shang, I know the items belong to you and I\u2019m in no position to tell you what to do. However, I honestly cannot just stand by and watch as these people corrupt the values that uphold this field. If you want to sell your collectibles, I can introduce you to reliable buyers. No matter what, please don\u2019t collaborate with Meng Hua.\u201dYu Zhengdu felt perplexed listening to this. He had initially felt that the old man\u2019s response to Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g selling the Gou family\u2019s collectibles had been a bit overly intense. He had only a.s.sumed that the other was in great pain over the fact that his s.h.i.+xiong\u2019s possessions were getting auctioned off. As of now, though, it seemed like things weren\u2019t so simple.He glanced at Shang Que. Shen Wenrong, who was nearby, noticed this out of his peripheral vision. Without waiting for Yu Zhengdu to ask Shang Que and Shang Que to ask him, he hurriedly scooted over himself to start explaining to Yu Zhengdu.Shang Que felt furious in his heart:After listening to Shen Wenrong\u2019s explanation, Yu Zhengdu finally gained a clear understanding of the entire story. It turned out that the reason Old Mr. w.a.n.g was so furious \u2013 aside from the fact that Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g was auctioning off the Gou family\u2019s collectibles \u2013 was mainly because Meng Hua\u2019s true plan was to use the Gou family\u2019s antique collection and influence to establish Meng Hua\u2019s position in the antique collection world. Ultimately, they wanted to collaborate with high-status collectors to control the market.Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g wasn\u2019t working with Liu Ao only for the profits that could be earned from auctioning collectibles either. Instead, he wanted to become the true authority figure in this field.And, if Meng Hua succeeded, there would be more consequences than market pricing chaos. These people didn\u2019t respect cultural relics at all. Who knew what other immoral acts they would be capable of committing?w.a.n.g Gezhi was complaining about Liu Ao\u2019s wrongful behavior, but Liu Ao didn\u2019t care at all. He even explained to Shang Que, pleased, \u201cMr. Shang, my s.h.i.+shu is telling the truth. Our goal is to become the dictators of the market. Think about it. With the items in your possession, as long as you collaborate with us, you\u2019ll definitely be able to summon the wind and rain in the collectors\u2019 circle. By then, all you would need to do is say the word and you could get anything you want.\u201dIt had to be said that Liu Ao\u2019s offer was truly very tempting. Otherwise, someone like Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g, who was the heir to a generational family, wouldn\u2019t have let himself get dragged in.But Shang Que\u2019s level of indifference was far greater than Liu Ao had thought. He coldly gazed at Liu Ao. \u201cI\u2019ve long since been able to summon the wind and rain .\u201dLiu Ao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu\u2019s brows were tightly knit together as he listened to Shen Wenrong\u2019s explanation. He thought about it, then tugged Shang Que and asked, \u201cBoss, can you listen to me just this one time?\u201dShang Que looked at him. \u201cI can listen to you as many times as you want.\u201dHe hadn\u2019t even asked Yu Zhengdu what he was going to say.Yu Zhengdu felt a warmth in his heart. He patted the back of Shang Que\u2019s hand and walked forward, then told Liu Ao, \u201cMr. Liu, the items in my Boss\u2019s possession may possibly be sold in the future\u2026\u2026\u201dA delighted expression appeared on Liu Ao\u2019s face. w.a.n.g Gezhi and Shen Wenrong were astounded. Just as they were about to b.u.t.t in, they heard Yu Zhengdu continue, \u201cBut not to Meng Hua.\u201d\u201cIn the future, as long as you guys auction off items belonging to the Gou family, we\u2019ll give the same items to your opponents. For example, if you auction off a pair of little Jingkang Tongbao coins, we\u2019ll give two pairs to your compet.i.tors.\u201dFollowing Yu Zhengdu\u2019s words, Liu Ao\u2019s expression became more and more foul.Everybody else finally understood too.Yu Zhengdu\u2019s actions were completely preventing Meng Hua from acting on their backup plan.Meng Hua wanted to monopolize the market. To do so, they absolutely needed to be able to place some completely unique goods on the market. As long as Shang Que refused to sell, the Gou family would still own the largest collection of Song artifacts. The Gou family\u2019s collection was more than enough for Meng Hua to beat out all the other auction houses.However, if Shang Que collaborated with Meng Hua\u2019s opponents, Meng Hua\u2019s trump card \u2013 the Gou family \u2013 would be completely ruined. No matter what they brought out to sell, their opponent would definitely have something more impressive than them.This was truly taking the firewood out from under the cauldron .Liu Ao had never expected that Yu Zhengdu would make such a decision. He instantly became outraged. Finally, he completely ripped off his mask of fake kindness and reached out to push Yu Zhengdu. \u201cYou dare to?!\u201dBefore his hands could even make contact, Shang Que gently waved from off to the side.The next second, Liu Ao had already gotten flung into the distance.Shang Que lowered his gaze. \u201cHe dares.\u201dLiu Ao couldn\u2019t figure out how he had flown out at all. He only thought that Shang Que seemed to be impossibly strong. This caused him to feel both shocked and angry. However, he ultimately didn\u2019t dare to act out again. He only resentfully stated, \u201cIf you dare to become Meng Hua\u2019s enemies, wait and see.\u201dHe had originally been planning to make a grand exit, but that fall that had resulted in him landing on his b.u.t.t had been too hard. He could only resort to limping away.From the back, this image was rather pitiful.By now, w.a.n.g Gezhi had understood Yu Zhengdu\u2019s intentions as well. On the spot, he deeply bowed to him. \u201cMr. Yu, Mr. Shang, thank you guys very much. Truly.\u201dShen Wenrong hurriedly bowed as well.Yu Zhengdu couldn\u2019t be compared to Boss, who was a thousand-year-old ancient ghost. He didn\u2019t dare to accept such a deep bow from an elder; he hurriedly helped the other up.The reason Old Mr. w.a.n.g had wanted to have a private conversation with Shang Que was because of this topic. He wanted to warn him so that he wouldn\u2019t be used by Meng Hua. Yet, he hadn\u2019t expected for Shang Que to be surprisingly indifferent. Also, Yu Zhengdu was very keen. This saved him from having to try and make an argument.w.a.n.g Gezhi lamented, \u201cIf Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g could have half of your guys\u2019 awareness, I wouldn\u2019t have to be so worried.\u201dYu Zhengdu chuckled. \u201cOld mister, feel free to rest at ease. It seems to me that your s.h.i.+zhi probably won\u2019t be selling the Gou family\u2019s artifacts anymore.\u201dThe main reason Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g had brought out the Gou family\u2019s collectibles hadn\u2019t been for money. Instead, it had been to work with Meng Hua to control the entire market. As of now, Shang Que had suddenly stuck his foot into their plan. This rendered their entire plan a failure. Not only so, but because the objects in Shang Que\u2019s possession had been shown to the world, the Gou family\u2019s collection would definitely be worth much less than it had been before.Auctioning off collectibles was already completely meaningless to Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g.w.a.n.g Gezhi pondered for a bit before realizing this too. He instantly smiled. This smile was filled with slight disappointment. \u201cThat would be best. At least s.h.i.+xiong\u2019s life\u2019s work has been saved.\u201dThey spoke for a while longer. w.a.n.g Gezhi actually wasn\u2019t as old-fas.h.i.+oned as Liu Ao and them had said. Collectibles among the general public were always switching owners. As long as these transactions weren\u2019t illegal, he didn\u2019t actually mind people selling artifacts. He even took the initiative to introduce some buyers to Shang Que.What surprised him was, Shang Que truly didn\u2019t have any intentions to sell at all. His att.i.tude about this was very simple too: only prodigal sons needed to sell their family possessions\u2026\u2026unless it was a certain employee who wanted to sell them.A certain employee didn\u2019t have any intentions to do so either. Even during their company\u2019s most difficult times, he hadn\u2019t thought of selling antiques as a solution. Also, the objects in Shang Que\u2019s possession seemed to be rather remarkable cultural relics. If they got dispersed, who knew where they would end up? It was better to let Shang Que himself hold onto them.Yu Zhengdu expressed his opinion to w.a.n.g Gezhi. The old mister felt even more like lamenting. In the end, he left them his contact information. If Shang Que wanted to sell in the future, he could contact him. w.a.n.g Gezhi would help him get in contact with people with governmental backgrounds to ensure the reliability of the transaction.Yu Zhengdu very professionally acted like an a.s.sistant and socialized with Old Mr. w.a.n.g. Finally, they reached a happy agreement. Old Mr. w.a.n.g was very reluctant to leave. He still wanted to invite Yu Zhengdu and them to visit his house.Yu Zhengdu couldn\u2019t make a decision without asking. Thus, he looked toward Shang Que.Only now did he realize that at some unknown time, Shang Que had already pulled out his phone and started gaming.Yu Zhengdu could only pat him. \u201cBoss, the old mister is inviting you to his house?\u201d\u201cNot going,\u201d Shang Que rejected. Then, he pressed on his phone screen in agitation. \u201cThis money-spending b.a.s.t.a.r.d! He actually spent twenty thousand! Of course he would win without having to do anything!\u201dShen Wenrong often surfed the web. He knew about the act of spending money on games. Upon hearing this, he chuckled. \u201cWhy not spend some money too, Mr. Shang?\u201dShang Que glared at him, furious.Shen Wenrong:Only to see that there was slight embarra.s.sment visible in Shang Que\u2019s eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t have that much spare money.\u201dShen Wenrong:<b>The author has something to say:</b>Xiaokui: I am Xiaokui.

Because both of them were men, the main event organizer booked a standard room with two beds for them.A lot of things had happened today. When they returned to the hotel, Yu Zhengdu directly flopped onto the bed and refused to get back up. Upon noticing this, Shang Que didn\u2019t suggest heading out to eat. Instead, he pulled out his phone and started ordering takeout.He familiarly opened the takeout red envelope sharing group chat belonging to the subsidiary company\u2019s programmers. He clicked into the links one by one to grab red envelopes. Then, he opened the takeout app and chose the largest red envelope he could use. After successfully placing the order, he shared the new red envelope link into the group chat.This stream of actions had truly been completed very smoothly. So smoothly that it caused one\u2019s heart to hurt.\u2026\u2026You couldn\u2019t see the domineering air that a big collector ought to have at all.Yu Zhengdu, who witnessed this entire process, couldn\u2019t help bursting into laughter. He remembered what Shang Que had said at the convention center and, after brief thought, asked, \u201cBoss, those Song Dynasty antiques that you own are all your family possessions?\u201d\u201c , they were things I used in the past.\u201d Shang Que seemed to be slightly speechless. \u201cBack then, they weren\u2019t that remarkable at all, but after enough time, they\u2019ve surprisingly become very valuable\u2026\u2026The things humans value are truly very strange.\u201d\u201cBecause the lifespan of a human is very short. Forget a thousand years. Even history from a hundred years prior is considered very long ago to humans. Because we can\u2019t see it, we can only use these old objects to try and recreate the past.\u201d\u201cPerhaps.\u201d It was obvious that Shang Que couldn\u2019t really understand this feeling. However, because Yu Zhengdu was so seriously explaining it to him, he still diligently considered this.\u201cSpeaking of, you\u2019ve been alive for so many years. You ought to have a lot of other goodies, right?\u201d Yu Zhengdu flipped over. He sprawled out on the blanket, eyes twinkling as he gazed at Shang Que. \u201cLike stuff from the Ming Dynasty or Qing Dynasty. Can you let me see those too?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have anything else.\u201d Shang Que paused for a moment before turning his face away. \u201cI didn\u2019t experience the later dynasties. I don\u2019t have anything from them either.\u201dYu Zhengdu temporarily froze. Suddenly, what Daoist priest Mu had told him about the legend of the Ghost King of Luofeng Mountain appeared in his mind\u2014\u2014The Ghost King of Luofeng Mountain had been born of the malefic aura of evil spirits. He had no past life and wouldn\u2019t enter the cycles of reincarnation. From birth, he was capable of commanding tens of thousands of evil ghosts.He originally should have become a legend among the three realms. In actuality, the bits and pieces of records left behind from a thousand years ago truly did confirm how the Ghost King of Luofeng Mountain had once been a glorious presence. His reach had been so broad that in the mortal realm, some people hadn\u2019t wors.h.i.+pped the true G.o.ds and had wors.h.i.+pped him instead.But out of the blue, this Ghost King had completely disappeared. From then on, there were no more legends regarding the Ghost King in the mortal realm anymore. It was like he had never been born.Regarding this point, Yu Zhengdu had previously had many guesses. However, he had never considered this possibility before.No wonder why Shang Que clearly didn\u2019t mind talking about the past, even occasionally cussing out those dramas set in the Song Dynasty, but had never mentioned any dynasty after the two Songs.He actually hadn\u2019t experienced any of the following dynasties. Then where had he gone those one thousand years? And what had he been doing?Yu Zhengdu gazed at Shang Que. Shang Que looked elsewhere, only leaving a striking and cold side profile. His eyes were as dark as bottomless pits. Yu Zhengdu didn\u2019t know what he was thinking.A while later, Shang Que finally came back to his senses. He noticed Yu Zhengdu\u2019s gaze out of his periphery. After a moment of hesitation, he asked, \u201cAre you very interested in the relics from the later dynasties?\u201d\u201cNo, I was just making small talk.\u201d Yu Zhengdu had a lot of questions in his heart, but he didn\u2019t continue to ask them. As if nothing had happened, he smiled and changed the topic. \u201cI\u2019m only interested in your family possessions. Can you show them to me again?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s there to see about family possessions?\u201d Shang Que asked with great restraint. However, his mood obviously became a lot better. He stuffed his hand into his pocket and started pulling stuff out. \u201cIf you want to see them, though, I guess I\u2019ll show you\u2026\u2026\u201dHe scanned Yu Zhengdu out of his periphery and very casually tugged a piece of paper out. \u201cActually, I was doing pretty well for myself. I owned a house in Bianliang a thousand years ago too\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is my property deed from that time.\u201d He handed that piece of paper to Yu Zhengdu. After brief thought, he seemed to fear that Yu Zhengdu wouldn\u2019t understand. Thus, he added, \u201cBack then, Bianliang was the capital city. So you know, this was the equivalent of owning a home in the modern capital city.\u201dYu Zhengdu accepted the property deed: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dJust as he thought of this, Shang Que also handed over a bright and translucent stone the size of a chicken egg. It was easy to tell even from just a glance that this was a remarkable gem. He modestly introduced, \u201cThis is a luminescent pearl . It glows in the dark.\u201dYu Zhengdu felt like he was close to suffering a heart attack. Uncontrollably, he started feeling a bit resentful towards the wealthy\u2026\u2026A luminescent pearl the size of a chicken egg. Even he, a normal civilian who knew nothing about gemstones, knew that this pearl was definitely a priceless treasure.Shang Que wasn\u2019t done after showing off his house. He wanted to show off his gems too?When Yu Zhengdu accepted the pearl, Shang Que continued, \u201c\u2026\u2026This was what I previously kept in my horse carriage as a light source. The carriage I used back then was pretty good too.\u201dYu Zhengdu: ??Could this be a modern retelling of the legendary buying the case and returning the pearl ? Boss was using his pearl to show off his carriage?Just as Yu Zhengdu was feeling completely bewildered, Shang Que suddenly turned his face away and calmly gave his last statement: \u201cAlso, I don\u2019t have parents.\u201dThe Ghost King was born of Luofeng Mountain. He had no past life and wouldn\u2019t enter the cycles of reincarnation. He naturally didn\u2019t have parents.Yu Zhengdu stared, bewildered, at the property deed in his hand that represented possession of a house in the capital and the luminescent pearl in his other hand that represented possession of a carriage. He combined these with the last thing Boss had said. And then, he realized.f.u.c.k!Wasn\u2019t this the legendary perfect marriage partner\u2014\u2014owns a car, owns a house, both parents are dead!Yu Zhengdu turned to look at Shang Que. He didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. Even though Boss was bad at dating, he had lots and lots of tricks up his sleeve.Shang Que observed Yu Zhengdu\u2019s exasperated expression. He didn\u2019t know what the other was thinking. Thus, he hesitantly asked, \u201cYou don\u2019t like them?\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201cThat\u2019s not it\u2026\u2026\u201dBefore he could even finish speaking, Shang Que had already pulled\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bout from his pocket again. \u201cYou like this a bit more, right? Then I\u2019ll just give this to you.\u201dA painting suddenly got stuffed into Yu Zhengdu\u2019s hands once more. He was honestly both amused and annoyed. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean.\u201d\u201cNo matter,\u201d Shang Que said, \u201cI can give you whatever you want.\u201d\u201cYou haven\u2019t told me why you\u2019re giving me gifts yet.\u201d Yu Zhengdu stared straight at him, slight amus.e.m.e.nt on his face. \u201cWithout a logical reason, I won\u2019t accept anything.\u201dHis eyes were bright. His gaze was pa.s.sionate. This actually made Shang Que blank out for a moment.\u201cYou still don\u2019t understand?\u201dYu Zhengdu patiently spoke. His voice wasn\u2019t loud, but it was very clear. It caused waves of emotion to flood one\u2019s heart.Shang Que only felt like his heart had skipped a beat. He suddenly stood up and released an elegant . \u201cI\u2019ll head downstairs to grab the takeout.\u201dHe took quick and stable steps towards the door, then opened it and walked out. The entire back of his figure readYu Zhengdu honestly couldn\u2019t help the smile on his face. He flopped over and laid down on the soft blanket. While hugging the painting, he burst into m.u.f.fled laughter.However, after only a short period of lying down, he suddenly felt like something was off. The room had strangely cooled down. Soon after, the painting in his hands had surprisingly started imperceptibly trembling.As an experienced Luofeng worker, Yu Zhengdu instantly flipped over and stood up. He walked over to the edge of the desk and placed the painting down. Then, he slowly unfurled it.As the scroll slowly unfurled, Yu Zhengdu\u2019s eyes subconsciously widened.The scenery in the painting had started moving.In the painting, there were tall mountain peaks behind Songfeng Pavilion. Atop the mountain peaks stood pine trees. At this time, however, a gust of wind seemed to have blown through the painting. Those pine tree branches were gently s.h.i.+fting in the wind. If one listened carefully, they could even hear a soft rustling noise.This scene was honestly strange. If a normal person saw this, they would probably become terrified. However, Yu Zhengdu only slightly furrowed his brows, crossed his arms over his chest, and silently continued to watch the painting scroll.Probably because it felt confused about his att.i.tude, the painting suddenly paused for a short moment too. After that, it started moving once more.This time, the slight breeze had turned into a wild wind. The pine tree branches forcefully shook back and forth. A few slightly thinner pine trees even gently bent over because of the wind. The initial faint rustling had also become a roar. The wind tore through the pine trees angrily, causing one\u2019s heart to beat faster.Yu Zhengdu was still unbothered.The painting still hadn\u2019t received its desired reaction. It finally couldn\u2019t take it anymore. Only to hear a soft creak \u2013 the door to the Songfeng Pavilion had been opened. A simply drawn tiny person walked out from inside. He looked up and made eye contact with Yu Zhengdu.Yu Zhengdu expressionlessly stared at him.That little matchstick person glared. He angrily yelled, \u201cHow bold! Why aren\u2019t you immediately bowing upon seeing me, the painting immortal?!\u201dYu Zhengdu wasn\u2019t scared in the slightest. He calmly pulled his Luofeng phone out of his pocket and opened the Underworld energy detection app to scan this little person.What a tiny black being!Upon noticing that Yu Zhengdu was pointing a strange object at him in addition to not being scared and refusing to bow, that little person instantly became outraged. \u201cYou are so impolite. Do you not want to live anymore?\u201d\u201cYou tiny ghost,\u201d Yu Zhengdu drawled out. \u201cIf you\u2019re smart, you\u2019ll immediately come out of there yourself. Otherwise, I\u2019m going to act!\u201dThis was the first time the little matchstick person had encountered such a situation. His entire being frozen. Then, he became so angry he started jumping up and down. \u201cYou actually dare to call me, an immortal, \u2018tiny ghost\u2019! I\u2019m an immortal! Not a ghost! Apologize right this instant or I\u2019m going to kill you!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s see who\u2019s going to kill who!\u201d Yu Zhengdu rolled his sleeves up, reached out, and hammered down on the little matchstick person\u2019s head. \u201cThe Underworld energy around you is off the charts, yet you still dare to pretend to be an immortal!\u201dThe little matchstick person had never met someone who wasn\u2019t scared of him and also truly dared to actually hit him. In a moment of carelessness, he got hammered in the head. He instantly squatted on the ground in pain. While holding onto his head, he started crying. \u201cHow could you hit a painting immortal?! You\u2019re too much!\u201dFollowing his words, the wind started up in the painting once again. This time, it was even stronger. As it roared to life, it actually blew the tiled roof of the Songfeng Pavilion off too.The little matchstick person\u2019s voice was cold and bitter. \u201cDo you believe me when I say that I can let you know right this instant the consequences of offending the painting immortal?!\u201dYu Zhengdu pulled out his phone. \u201cDo you believe me when I say that I can call a dozen ghosts over to beat you up with one phone call?!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve seen too many people like you who love to bluff,\u201d the little matchstick person replied. Then, he reached out and actually poked a hand out of the painting. However, when his hand exited the scroll, it was no longer a thin line of ink; instead, it became a bony, withered hand that was stained black. There were sharp nails on his fingers. \u201cCome, come into the painting to accompany me\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAccompany who?\u201d The door to the room opened. Shang Que walked in while carrying the takeout.The air in the room suddenly came to a standstill. The hand in the scroll instantly froze. Immediately thereafter, that hand started very obviously shaking. The matchstick person\u2019s voice was shaking too. \u201cIs this the, the\u2026\u2026ghost that you called?\u201dOf course not. This was only a coincidence.Yu Zhengdu was too lazy to explain. The matchstick person was so terrified that he wanted to pull his hand back into the painting. Before he could act, though, Shang Que had already stepped forward and grabbed his hand. Then, he yanked \u2013 a thin Underworld spirit who was covered in black smoke got thrown out of the painting and landed on his b.u.t.t on the floor of the room.Yu Zhengdu looked back at the painting. It had already returned to its original state, almost as if nothing had ever happened.\u201cGreat King, spare me\u2014\u2014Great King, spare me\u2014\u2014\u201d The matchstick person plopped onto the ground and kneeled. He started kowtowing towards Shang Que.\u201cWhere did you come from? How dare you try and act against Luofeng?\u201d Yu Zhengdu started interrogating the ghost in a very experienced manner.\u201cLuofeng?\u201d That ghost\u2019s expression was bewildered. \u201cWhat\u2019s Luofeng?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know Luofeng?\u201d Yu Zhengdu was very confused too. These days, as soon as people died, they would instantly be able to receive a message from Luofeng. In all his time working at the company, this was his first time encountering a ghost who didn\u2019t know Luofeng.Shang Que wasn\u2019t too surprised, though. He said, \u201cProbably a ghost from before the founding of the new state .\u201dYu Zhengdu was struck by realization. The collapse of the Heavens and earth had happened after the campaign to Destroy the Four Olds . Luofeng had also only been formed following this. If this ghost was from the era before this and received very limited information, it was truly possible that he wouldn\u2019t know Luofeng.As expected, when they asked, they found out that this ghost was from the Qing Dynasty.Yu Zhengdu furrowed his brows. \u201cWhy has a ghost from the Qing Dynasty not headed off to reincarnation yet?\u201dAs soon as he mentioned this, the ghost revealed a slightly pleased expression on his face. \u201cWhat\u2019s so good about reincarnation? Since death, I\u2019ve become a painting immortal. From then on, I\u2019ve been able to spend my days in paintings, browsing through all the famous art pieces of the world. How carefree and satisfying. Why would I rejoin the ranks of the worldly common people?\u201d\u201cA painting ghost is just a painting ghost,\u201d Yu Zhengdu said with disdain. \u201cStop trying to make yourself seem more impressive.\u201dPainting Ghost: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe painting ghost dared to be angry but didn\u2019t dare to express his anger. He pitifully glanced at Shang Que and carefully asked, \u201cSo who are you guys?\u201d\u201cLuofeng Life Management Ltd. Co.\u201d Yu Zhengdu handed his business card over. \u201cThe modern h.e.l.l.\u201dThe painting ghost was shocked. \u201cH-h.e.l.l?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Yu Zhengdu patiently gave him an explanation. At the really end, he said, \u201cOur goal is to maintain the balance between the mortal realm and Underworld. We want to help every ghost reincarnate as soon as possible, because staying for too long in the mortal realm will affect the normal order of human society.\u201d\u201cYour behavior just now was a violation of the related rules. According to procedure, you ought to be arrested and deducted Good and Evil Scores,\u201d Yu Zhengdu stated. \u201cConsidering that you\u2019re a ghost from before the founding of the new state who doesn\u2019t know anything about these regulations, though, we will reduce your sentence accordingly. Don\u2019t cause any additional trouble either. Hurry and go reincarnate.\u201dAfter listening to Yu Zhengdu\u2019s explanation, the painting ghost was still a bit dazed. When he heard Yu Zhengdu telling him to go reincarnate, he instantly started acting defiant again. \u201cI don\u2019t want to reincarnate. Being a painting immortal isn\u2019t bad. I\u2019m very satisfied with my current life.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case\u2026\u2026\u201d Shang Que lifted his gaze and pulled out a pair of disposable chopsticks from the takeout bag. While separating them, he said, \u201cThen I\u2019ll eat you.\u201dPainting Ghost: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe painting ghost hadn\u2019t expected that the modern h.e.l.l would be like this. He instantly started crying out of fear. In between sniffling and crying, he finally shared the truth. \u201cGreat King, don\u2019t eat me! It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to go reincarnate, it\u2019s that I can\u2019t go reincarnate!\u201dYu Zhengdu furrowed his brows. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m actually not satisfied with my current life at all. I only bluffed because I\u2019m too proud to admit this\u2026\u2026\u201d The painting ghost stuttered out, \u201cI can\u2019t leave my painting to go reincarnate\u2026\u2026\u201dIt turned out that this painting ghost had been a scholar in the Qing Dynasty. He had spent his whole life working towards scholarly honor, but was unfortunately only mediocre at academics. In the end, he failed to pa.s.s the provincial exams. However, despite the fact that he wasn\u2019t great at academics, he was rather talented at painting. Eventually, a fellow villager that he was quite close with wrote him a letter of recommendation to become a guest at the estate of an important government official who liked art and calligraphy.During a banquet hosted by the government official, he ordered all his guests to help entertain his visitors. There were live poem recitations. The government official liked impressing people, so ordered the scholar to paint everyone enjoying the banquet. This way, he would be able to view this scene again later with his visitors.The scholar was instantly delighted. He understood that this was his opportunity to prove himself. Thus, he used 120% of his skills and painted the piece that he was most satisfied with in his entire life. Unfortunately, he valued achievement too much, which caused him to worry too much. Just as he was about to finish the painting, due to the fact that he was overly nervous, he accidentally knocked over the ink. This painting was ruined in the blink of an eye.That government official was shamed in front of his visitors. As such, he kicked the scholar out of his estate. The scholar was hung up over this matter; shortly after, he died from sorrow. Following his death, his spirit possessed the painting that had been ruined by ink and he became a painting ghost.After hearing this, Yu Zhengdu heaved out a great sigh. He summarized, \u201cThe moral of this story is, your emotional state during important tests is very crucial.\u201dShang Que calmly said, \u201cAll we need to do is obtain the painting and release your soul.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t obtain it,\u201d the painting ghost said.Yu Zhengdu: \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cActually\u2026\u2026actually, I was only acting on orders this time. I was told to come scare you guys.\u201d The painting ghost guiltily glanced at them. Only, he had never expected that he would fail in scaring them and almost become the Ghost King\u2019s meal instead.Yu Zhengdu came to a realization after brief thought. \u201cDid Meng Hua Auction House order you to come?\u201d\u201c Wuwuwu , I didn\u2019t do it on purpose,\u201d the painting ghost cried. \u201cThe painting I possess is in their hands. I\u2019m honestly not in control of myself.\u201dIt turned out that after the scholar died, that painting stained with ink had been buried with him. After several twists and turns, his grave became the grounds for a building. That painting also got excavated by the property developers. Those in real estate treated these objects belonging to the dead as taboo. They found a random religious master to look over it. Later on, the people behind Meng Hua somehow found out about this painting. They spent a lot of money and energy to obtain it.\u201cEach time they encounter a painting they want where the owner doesn\u2019t want to sell it, or the price is too high, they\u2019ll send me out. I\u2019ll enter the painting and scare the owners like I did today. As such, the owners would think that there was something wrong with their painting and be too scared to keep it. And then, Meng Hua would be able to buy it at a low price\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu \u2019d and lamented, \u201cI\u2019m honestly not surprised at all.\u201dGiven Meng Hua and Liu Ao\u2019s tendencies, it was entirely too normal for them to be capable of doing something like this.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be helping them do bad deeds either,\u201d the painting ghost said, depressed. \u201cI honestly have no other options. The painting I\u2019m possessing is in their hands. I can\u2019t help but listen to their orders.\u201dYu Zhengdu\u2019s expression was conflicted. \u201cYour mindset sucks too much. How many years has it been since the Qing Dynasty? You still haven\u2019t let that painting go?\u201d\u201cWhat do you understand?!\u201d The painting ghost couldn\u2019t help bursting into tears again. \u201cThat was the most perfect painting I ever made. Originally, I could\u2019ve used that painting to quickly rise through the ranks. Why did I have to knock over the ink? Even before my death, I was thinking, \u2018How wonderful it would be if I could just suck the ink I knocked over back out.\u2019 I entered the painting with the sole purpose of wiping away the ink on the painting. But I can\u2019t wipe it off! I can\u2019t wipe it off!\u201d\u201cIf I can\u2019t wipe that ink off, how could I be willing to go reincarnate?!\u201dThe more the painting ghost said, the sadder he got. Yu Zhengdu\u2019s ears had already started ringing because of his howls. He couldn\u2019t help blurting out, \u201cThen you should go reincarnate even more. These days, you can draw with tablets and photoshop. You can restart whenever you want and edit your drawing however you want.\u201dThe painting ghost\u2019s cries suddenly stopped. He blankly looked at Yu Zhengdu. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201dYu Zhengdu pulled out his own laptop and opened a software application for drawing. Then, he clicked open a sticker and started showing the painting ghost how to use PS to edit the picture.The painting ghost stared with wide eyes as Yu Zhengdu showed him how to use modern drawing software. His entire ghostly being was shocked out of his mind. In great disbelief, he said, \u201cSuch a mysterious thing actually exists in this world?\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201cModern society is full of wonders you can\u2019t imagine.\u201dA bright expression slowly appeared on the painting ghost\u2019s face. He suddenly stood up straight, placed his hands on his hips, and leaned his head back to laugh. \u201cI\u2019m fine! I\u2019ve recovered! I want to go reincarnate! I\u2019m going to use these mysterious new art tools that belong to these new times!\u201dAfter he finished speaking, he reached a hand out to point at the silly panda sticker that Yu Zhengdu had casually opened. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to learn this brand new style of art!\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d<b>The author has something to say:</b>Xiaokui: I!

However, for some reason, the painting ghost was late this time.He was anxious in his heart, but couldn\u2019t do anything else. He could only sit there and wait. After an unknown period of time, the roar of Underworld wind suddenly sounded out in the room. The painting hanging on the wall of the office started moving.Liu Ao relaxed. Then, he started cussing, \u201cUseless piece of s.h.i.+t. How come you took so long this time?\u201d\u201cI can take however long I want. What the f.u.c.k does it have to do with you?!\u201d The painting ghost asked from the painting on the wall.Liu Ao\u2019s temples throbbed. He instantly became furious and turned in the direction of that voice. \u201cPiece of s.h.i.+t, who gave you the courage to speak to me like that?!\u201dWhen he turned around, though, he became shocked. It turned out that there was a high-quality counterfeit of\u300aMona Lisa\u300bhanging on that wall.And at this time, Mona Lisa\u2019s mysterious smile had surprisingly changed into a famous sticker from the Internet\u2014\u2014the silly panda\u2019s disdainful smile. Not only so, but Mona Lisa also held up her middle fingers at him. Next to her face, a line of words read:\u3010Eat s.h.i.+t, Liu Ao!\u3011This Cantonese sticker was honestly too popular. Even Liu Ao, who resided in the capital, recognized it instantly: ???At the same time, the painting ghost\u2019s pleased voice sounded out. \u201c Liang Jingru gave me the courage, hehe!\u201dLiu Ao hadn\u2019t expected that this usually cowardly and weak painting ghost would actually dare to speak to him in this manner. He became temporarily stunned. However, he soon regained his wits. Completely outraged, he yelled, \u201cHow absurd! Do you want to die?\u201dOnly to see the silly Mona Lisa furrow her brows and twist her mouth. The caption next to her became:\u3010I\u2019m already dead anyways!\u3011Liu Ao was utterly discomfited. He pulled open the drawer of his desk and retrieved a painting from inside it. Then, he unfurled this painting and coldly laughed. \u201cDo you believe me when I say that I\u2019ll rip up this s.h.i.+tty painting right now?\u201dThat was a festive and rowdy painting of a high-cla.s.s banquet. Though the painting had already started turning yellow with age, one could still tell that the painter had rather extraordinary talent. The lines of the painting were delicate and very detailed. Only looking at the scene on the paper made one feel like they were there in person; it was almost as if they could hear the sounds of the singing and dancing at the banquet. Unfortunately, half of this exquisite painting was covered with a thick layer of ink. This stain instantly ruined the painting. A true pity.Mona Lisa, who had originally been provoking Liu Ao with a silly expression on, revealed a slightly sorrowful expression upon seeing this banquet painting. She subconsciously sighed softly.\u201cKnow to be scared now, huh?\u201d Liu Ao\u2019s lips were turned up in a smirk. Pleased, he said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want me to rip up this painting, behave\u2026\u2026\u201dBefore he could even finish, he saw Mona Lisa come back to her senses. An encouraging smile appeared on her face. The words next to her changed once again:\u3010What wonderful ripping! Rip even louder!\u3011She was even clapping with her hands!Liu Ao was absolutely flabbergasted. He pointed at the painting ghost while trembling. \u201cY-y-you, you\u2019ve gone crazy!\u201dMona Lisa side-eyed him while smiling.\u3010Unexpected, right?!\u3011Liu Ao jumped in place. \u201cDon\u2019t think that I don\u2019t actually dare to rip the painting!\u201dAt this time, the painting ghost had finally had his fun. Mona Lisa slowly returned to the way she originally was: she no longer made herself into a sticker. The painting ghost\u2019s voice echoed in the room. \u201cThere\u2019s no need. I\u2019ll do it myself.\u201dHis voice was very distant. It no longer carried the previous cowardice and pretense as it had before. Instead, it sounded a bit relieved.Following his words, the painting in Liu Ao\u2019s hands seemed to catch fire. It slowly burned into ash. Liu Ao was shocked. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dHis hands instinctively shook. Those ashes thus dispersed, floating in the wind.Surprised, Liu Ao asked, \u201cYour spirit escaped the painting?\u201d\u201cYep,\u201d the painting ghost cheerily said.Immediately thereafter, the Meng Hua workers outside heard a horrible shriek sound out from their CEO\u2019s office. Everyone hurriedly ran over to open Liu Ao\u2019s office door. Then, they all became astounded.Only to see Liu Ao weakly sprawled out in his own office chair. The expression on his face was extremely strange. His features were so twisted they had almost completely switched places. It was unknown how he had accomplished this.A worker asked, \u201cCEO, are you okay?\u201dLiu Ao weakly waved his hands. \u201cCall an ambulance for me.\u201d\u201cOh, okay,\u201d the worker replied.While he dialed 120, everyone else realized that Liu Ao\u2019s expression looked more familiar the more they looked at it. Finally, someone couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cCEO, can you stop making the silly panda expression at us?\u201dLiu Ao roared, \u201cCan\u2019t you tell that I\u2019m having facial spasms?!\u201dThe events that transpired at the Song history symposium ended up on the news fairly quickly. The news that Song history Weibo account owner \u201cFrom Today On I Will Be A European G.o.d\u201d was a big collector of Song Dynasty antiques instantly exploded online.Meng Hua Auction House\u2019s ambitions had been too wild. They had invited many media representatives that day. Additionally, many of these media sources had big followings. In the end, even though they wanted to keep this news hidden, they failed to do so. This was a textbook example of picking up a stone to smack your own foot .Especially the news that the authentic version of the rare famous painting\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bhad appeared. Moreover, the fact that it had engaged in a live authentication battle with the Gou family\u2019s\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bwas too dramatic. This evoked a pa.s.sion for discussion from netizens. In one day, they managed to get Shang Que\u2019s name onto three trending topics. After gaining innumerous girlfriend fans and mom fans, Shang Que finally gained a new type of fan\u2014\u2014son fans.In the blink of an eye, everyone under Shang Que\u2019s Weibo was calling him dad .k3010;Dad, do you need a son? The type that\u2019s already finished universityk3011;k3010;Dad, I\u2019m your long lost son. Do you still remember the birthmark on my b.u.t.t?k3011;k3010;Dad, is my kneeling posture accurate enough?k3011;Luofeng and Amazing Future\u2019s employees all sent their congratulatory messages: Congratulations to Boss for finally gaining fanboys!Shang Que: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAdditionally, just as Yu Zhengdu and Old Mr. w.a.n.g had guessed in the beginning, because of the existence of the items in Shang Que\u2019s possession, the collector circle experienced a shuffling of the cards . The Gou family, a generational family who were experts on Song history, suffered the most. Gou s.h.i.+w.a.n.g released a statement saying that within a short amount of time, he wouldn\u2019t be considering auctioning off any part of his collection again.However, n.o.body knew exactly how many items Shang Que owned. Quite a few collectors and reporters tried to get in contact with Shang Que through numerous methods to either talk with him or interview him. However, they all got cleanly rejected. Even gossip reporters, who were usually any and everywhere, failed to get even a single picture of Shang Que. This incident became known as an absurd tale in the field of the reporting.However, with time, the attention slowly faded away. The media\u2019s interest also eventually transferred onto other people and news.Amidst the numerous reports and discussions, an article written by a certain gossip media reporter garnered a lot of people\u2019s interest.That report claimed that on the day of the symposium, not only had CEO taken out the authentic\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300b, he had also given the painting away on the spot to the employee attending with him. This was the employee\u2019s \u201covertime pay.\u201dRegretfully, this report only quoted other people at the symposium. They didn\u2019t have a personal interview with CEO at all; additionally, the accompanying picture was blurry and had obviously been taken in secret. As such, as soon as this report became published, it got seriously criticized by netizens.One reason was because the story in this report was too ridiculous. Another was because the person in the picture of the employee was clearly Senior.Though CEO and Senior\u2019s CP was very delicious , gossip media couldn\u2019t randomly make up information to borrow the CP\u2019s popularity like this, okay?!Offhandedly gifting a famous painting worth hundreds of millions to an employee: even dog-blooded dramas like \u201cDomineering CEO Has Fallen in Love With Me\u201d wouldn\u2019t dare to write stories like this into their plot!The media these days were honestly willing to do anything to get attention. The reporter who had written this report felt very wronged. He replied to the netizens in the comments, promising that their report was true and not made up at all.Eventually, some netizens honestly couldn\u2019t take it anymore. They specially private messaged Shang Que:\u3010CEO, there\u2019s a report that says you gave\u300aTrip to Songfeng Pavilion\u300bto Senior?\u3011Coincidentally, Shang Que was online. Because he had never come up with a good excuse, Yu Zhengdu ultimately refused to accept that painting. Looking at this question now, Shang Que felt very depressed. Thus, he angrily replied:\u3010No.\u3011He had failed to give it away!The netizen that Shang Que replied to posted the screenshot under that report: See, CEO himself already said he didn\u2019t give the painting away. How dare you say you didn\u2019t make that information up.That reporter was mind blown. This information had been personally spoken by those VIP guests at the symposium!Because this report was honestly too ridiculous, the majority of netizens only wanted to cuss the reporter out after seeing it. They weren\u2019t even interested in reposting it. As such, it didn\u2019t end up causing too much of a splash online.During this time, Yu Zhengdu received another invitation from his college cla.s.smate, Jia Yihua, inviting him to attend a meal together.Jia Yihua had held his wedding ceremony in his hometown of Minan. Because it was rather far away from Fu City, he didn\u2019t invite his cla.s.smates to attend. Only Yu Zhengdu had happened to be in Minan on a business trip at the time. Thus, he had managed to attend. It was also at that time that Shang Que had misunderstood and thought that Yu Zhengdu was going to confess to him. He hadn\u2019t been able to stop himself from showing off at the wedding reception; now, Yu Zhengdu\u2019s entire cla.s.s believed that Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que were in a relations.h.i.+p.This time, Jia Yihua was making up a reception with his cla.s.smates in Fu City. However, it was going to be a very simple affair more akin to a meal than a wedding reception. He had also told his cla.s.smates in advance that he didn\u2019t want wedding money .Yu Zhengdu had always had a pretty good relations.h.i.+p with his college cla.s.smates. After graduation, they rarely had the chance to meet up again. Because of this, everyone was very excited this time. Aside from Hou Guangzong and a few other people who honestly couldn\u2019t make the time, almost everyone expressed that they would attend. A lot of people also said that they would bring their significant others too.Because Shang Que was often on the trending topics list these days, members of Yu Zhengdu\u2019s group chat often shared Weibo posts regarding him into the chat for discussion. Thus, someone started asking Yu Zhengdu to bring Shang Que along.Jia Yihua:\u3010Yu Zhengdu, I\u2019m still leaving two empty slots for you this time. You understand\u3011Zhu Yan:\u3010Aaah, Zhengdu hasn\u2019t said anything ever since he got a boyfriend. He ought to be bringing his boyfriend over for us to see this time at least, right?!\u3011Cla.s.smate A:\u3010Exactly. Your boyfriend has so many fans online, we honestly can\u2019t rest at ease. Bring him over so we can help you appraise him\u3011Cla.s.smate B:\u3010\u2026\u2026Can I say that I\u2019m really against this in my heart? I was planning on bringing my new girlfriend along. Originally, with just Zhengdu present, that was already a very threatening situation. If his boyfriend attends too, will I still be allowed to survive?\u3011Cla.s.smate C:\u3010Are you stupid? Zhengdu alone is more threatening to you, okay? If he attends with his boyfriend, they\u2019re at most a handsome gay couple. That way, your girlfriend can truly give up on him!\u3011Cla.s.smate B:\u3010Yi? Makes sense! @Yu Zhengdu, please absolutely bring your boyfriend along!\u3011Yu Zhengdu honestly didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. As he watched everyone in the group chat take turns @\u2019ing him, he knew that this wouldn\u2019t end unless he said something.He thought about it and replied:\u3010Um, my Boss and I aren\u2019t in a relations.h.i.+p. However, I can ask him if he wants to go or not.\u3011As soon as he said this, the group chat became filled with question marks.Cla.s.smate A:\u3010What do you mean? Didn\u2019t you already come out of the closet? How come you aren\u2019t in a relations.h.i.+p yet?\u3011At this time, Zhang Qingqing finally couldn\u2019t help saying:\u3010Aiya, you guys are so annoying. Zhengdu has never said that they\u2019re dating, okay? You guys were the ones who made all those blind guesses!\u3011Because Zhang Qingqing had previously run into Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que on a date, she knew that they hadn\u2019t confirmed their relations.h.i.+p yet. It was a great taboo for others to incessantly mention couples during this ambiguous stage. If they failed to get together in the end, everyone would feel very awkward. As such, she decided to speak up for Yu Zhengdu.Many of the people in their group chat were very perceptive. Upon seeing that Yu Zhengdu himself had said that they weren\u2019t dating, and because Zhang Qingqing\u2019s tone was a bit sharp, they all guessed something. Immediately, they conscientiously changed the topic.Jia Yihua private messaged Yu Zhengdu:\u3010So are you coming alone or with a guest?\u3011Yu Zhengdu thought about it:\u3010Leave two s.p.a.ces for me, I guess. I\u2019ll ask my Boss if he\u2019s coming or not\u3011He stood up and walked into Shang Que\u2019s office to ask for time off.Shang Que furrowed his brows after learning of the reason. \u201cDrinking wedding wine again?\u201d\u201cYes. It\u2019s the same cla.s.smate as before too. He\u2019s holding a makeup reception here.\u201d Yu Zhengdu gazed at him and said with a smile, \u201cHe also told me to bring my significant other along.\u201dShang Que shot out of his seat. \u201cSignificant other? What significant other? Since when have you had a significant other?\u201dYu Zhengdu burst into laughter. \u201cHe was talking about the one from last time.\u201d\u201cThe one from last time?\u201d Shang Que froze for a moment before coming to a realization. His expression became awkward. He looked into the distance. \u201cYou didn\u2019t clear things up with him?\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201cI can\u2019t. The rumors are already out. It\u2019s hard to explain clearly.\u201dShang Que: \u201cThen what are you planning on doing?\u201dYu Zhengdu stuffed both hands into his sweats.h.i.+rt pocket. \u201cI\u2019m here to ask you if you want to come with me?\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u2026\u201d Shang Que\u2019s gaze flickered slightly. \u201cI\u2019m not even your significant other.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019re not even my significant other,\u201d Yu Zhengdu replied with a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll send the time and location to you. Consider it.\u201dShang Que kept a mouthful of air in. A moment later, he slowly exhaled. \u201cYou can have your time off.\u201dOn the day of the meeting, because he needed to take care of some work matters, Yu Zhengdu arrived rather late. When he got there, almost everyone else was already present.Jia Yihua had reserved a small private room. In total, there were four tables. Aside from his cla.s.smates and his cla.s.smates\u2019 partners, there were also a few students from other majors that Jia Yihua had been rather good friends with.Their cla.s.smates all greeted Yu Zhengdu as soon as they noticed him. Some reminisced about the past with him, some said they missed him, some wanted him to help them, and there were also a few jealous ones. Since he had started working, Yu Zhengdu had honestly been too successful. He had ended up on the trending topics list before and was in a position of power equivalent to the famous Zhao Ruola\u2019s. No matter how great of friends they were in the past, after joining society, certain people would have changes of heart. It was inevitable that some would start feeling envious.\u201cZhengdu, over here. I left you a spot.\u201d Zhu Yan stood up to pull Yu Zhengdu over. Then, he glanced in the direction of the door. \u201cAre you here alone? Just now, Yihua said he left two spots for you\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c , Boss isn\u2019t free,\u201d Yu Zhengdu sighed. As expected from a ghost who had remained single for a thousand years due to pure talent. His slow-wittedness in regards to feelings was shocking.But also because of this, Yu Zhengdu was extra careful in his att.i.tude when dealing with Shang Que about their relations.h.i.+p.Yu Zhengdu had just sat down next to Zhu Yan when someone asked out of the blue, \u201cYi? Cla.s.smate Yu, aren\u2019t you dating your boss? How come you didn\u2019t bring him this time?\u201dYu Zhengdu looked up. He saw a vaguely familiar face, but he couldn\u2019t remember whose face this was on the spot. Thus, he asked, \u201cMay I ask who you are?\u201dThat person\u2019s expression instantly became dark. His tone was slightly displeased. \u201cCla.s.smate Yu is truly the n.o.bleman with a poor memory . How long has it been since graduation for you to not recognize your cla.s.smate?\u201dYu Zhengdu, expression serious: \u201cWere you famous on campus?\u201dThat person had been tactfully rebuked. He was so angry that he couldn\u2019t get a response out.The female cla.s.smate sitting next to him hurriedly mediated the situation. \u201cAiya, you weren\u2019t even in the same college . It\u2019s normal that he doesn\u2019t remember you.\u201dThe other students helped speak up too. Yu Zhengdu finally remembered who this person was.Was\u2019t this Wu Shuojian, the law student who had relentlessly been his antifan on the school forum for four years?Wu Shuojian was an extremely petty individual. Because one of his girlfriends in college had once pursued Yu Zhengdu, he diligently said bad things about Yu Zhengdu on their school forum for a whole four years. He had been Yu Zhengdu\u2019s most famous antifan during college. However, he was ultimately a law student. He had protected his personal information very well. As such, to this day, n.o.body knew that the ident.i.ty of the antifan was Wu Shuojian.Yu Zhengdu had only found out after checking his IP address while bored.Previously, information about Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que\u2019s rumored relations.h.i.+p had been posted onto the forum. Wu Shuojian hadn\u2019t even forgotten to take this opportunity to criticize Yu Zhengdu for shamelessly sticking to his boss, etc. etc. He became cla.s.sified as a \u201cdemon\u201d who was jealous of a G.o.dly romance by Shang Que.The reason Wu Shuojian was attending this meal was because he and one of Yu Zhengdu\u2019s female cla.s.smates were dating. He was here as a \u201cplus one.\u201d The person who had spoken up to mediate the situation earlier was his current girlfriend.Seeing his presence, Yu Zhengdu knew that this meal probably wouldn\u2019t continue peacefully.As expected, a few minutes after everyone started eating, their cla.s.smates started making small talk with each other. They asked about everyone\u2019s recent work situations. Wu Shuojian thus took this chance to say, \u201cIf we\u2019re talking about work, the most successful person from our school is probably Cla.s.smate Yu, right?\u201dYu Zhengdu pretended to be eating. He didn\u2019t even look up at the other.But the other didn\u2019t care if he was answering or not. He continued on, \u201cHowever, some people on our school forum are honestly too much. Previously, I found a post that said Cla.s.smate Yu only got promoted because he shamelessly stuck to his boss. They sounded so sure of themselves. Truly don\u2019t know what kind of person they are.\u201dHe was obviously the one who had posted that.Yu Zhengdu rolled his eyes and said, \u201cSomeone with red-eye syndrome . Or, a lemon spirit . Who else?\u201dZhu Yan nodded too from next to him. \u201cExactly. They must be a loser with a dark heart!\u201dWu Shuojian had originally thought that Yu Zhengdu would make a few excuses for that person. He hadn\u2019t expected for him to be so impolite in his speech. He accidentally ended up getting attacked; Wu Shuojian felt so angry he was spitting blood in his heart. However, he still maintained a fake smile on his face. \u201cSpeaking of, people on the forum truly said that Cla.s.smate Yu and his boss were in a relations.h.i.+p. There was also an ID that cosplayed as your boss and said he was pursuing you. That was honestly hilarious. But there are also other posts these days that say you aren\u2019t in a relations.h.i.+p. So were you guys actually never in a relations.h.i.+p or did you break up?\u201dUpon hearing this, Yu Zhengdu realized that it was very probable that someone had posted screenshots from their group chat online again. This Wu Shuojian was also a very diligent antifan. His information was extremely up to date.\u201cDid you know? Cla.s.smate Wu\u2026\u2026\u201d Yu Zhengdu narrowed his eyes and stated, \u201cAside from my Third Aunt and my Sixth Great-Aunt, you\u2019re the only person who cares so much about my love life.\u201dWu Shuojian instantly became agitated. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dOriginally, the fact that he had guided the topic of conversation onto Yu Zhengdu and his boss\u2019s relations.h.i.+p had already made everyone feel uncomfortable. Only, they hadn\u2019t expected for Yu Zhengdu\u2019s response to be even more impolite than the other\u2019s questions. The tension around the table abruptly became more noticeable.His girlfriend hurriedly stopped him. \u201cShuojian, don\u2019t say so much.\u201dWu Shuojian was incredibly petty. How could he not retaliate after being publicly shamed by Yu Zhengdu? He instantly scoffed. \u201cHaven\u2019t I already limited my questions? I haven\u2019t even relayed all of the unpleasant comments that are on the forum. Right now, everyone on the forum is saying that Cla.s.smate Yu shamelessly stuck to his boss to get promoted. Unfortunately, his boss was only playing around, so dumped him.\u201dYu Zhengdu furrowed his brows. \u201cAre there such rumors?\u201dHe had a lot of work. Normally, he didn\u2019t check the forum. He only looked at the posts that his cla.s.smates shared into their group chat. However, he had never seen such a post before.Zhu Yan\u2019s expression was a bit awkward. He softly said, \u201c , some unknown person uploaded screenshots from our group chat onto the forum again. You know too that previously, everyone was saying that you and your boss were in a relations.h.i.+p. They even made it seem so realistic. Thus, everyone thought that you guys broke up this time.\u201dYu Zhengdu pulled out his phone and opened the school forum. He only realized what had happened after looking up the post and reading it.Just like Zhu Yan had stated, because his rumored relations.h.i.+p with Shang Que had seemed so realistic in the past, after this post, everyone naturally believed that they had broken up. Honestly too many people were paying attention to Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que\u2019s rumored relations.h.i.+p; as soon as someone mentioned a breakup, everyone instantly started guessing the reason for the breakup too.A newly registered fake account had taken this opportunity to post a short essay a.n.a.lyzing why they believed Yu Zhengdu had been dumped by Shang Que.Shang Que was a CEO. Recently, he was also always on the trending topics list. Everyone online knew that he was a big antique collector \u2013 his net worth couldn\u2019t be calculated. Additionally, he had countless fans who followed him. No matter from what perspective, it seemed more believable that he had been the one who dumped Yu Zhengdu.Not only so, but this fake account\u2019s claims were very crafty. After saying that Yu Zhengdu had been dumped, it also mentioned the fact that Yu Zhengdu had rapidly risen up the company ranks after graduation. The hidden meaning behind this was obvious even without being explicitly stated.It was true that Yu Zhengdu\u2019s legendary work experience caused many to feel admiration. At the same time, though, there were also many envious people. Prior to this, several people had already subtly made up stories about him. As soon as this short essay became posted, there were surprisingly a lot of people who agreed with its viewpoints. It had even been uploaded to the Internet by some ill-intending individual.Yu Zhengdu expressionlessly finished reading this post. When he looked up, he discovered that everyone at the table had awkward expressions on. It seemed that everyone had already seen this post a long time ago. However, probably because the claims in this post were honestly too demeaning, n.o.body had shared it into their group chat.Zhu Yan said, \u201cZhengdu, don\u2019t take this to heart. Who knows what kind of people are behind these IDs? They don\u2019t know anything, so they\u2019re just making random stuff up. There\u2019s no need to bother with them.\u201d\u201cI know who\u2019s behind these IDs.\u201d Yu Zhengdu put his phone back into his pocket and coldly glanced at Wu Shuojian. \u201cYou with the surname Wu, if you don\u2019t apologize and admit your mistakes right now, don\u2019t blame me for being impolite.\u201dThis sudden sentence caused Wu Shuojian\u2019s heart to skip a beat. He almost lost control of his expression. However, he very quickly calmed down once more.He personally believed that he had protected his information very well. Additionally, he had been saying bad things about Yu Zhengdu online for a whole four years. If Yu Zhengdu knew he was behind all this, how could it be possible for him to remain silent? Not to mention that this time, he had just created a new fake account. It was even less likely for him to get exposed.Yu Zhengdu was most likely so embarra.s.sed that he felt angry. Thus, he was merely finding someone to target as a means of displacing his anger. As such, Wu Shuojian instantly sat up straight. \u201cYou\u2019re too interesting. You yourself did those dirty things and someone else posted them online. Why are you taking your anger out on me?\u201dThis was a hard to come by opportunity. He decided to speak with great ill intent. \u201cWhy are you even bothering with what people are saying online? Either way, you\u2019ve already been promoted and got your money. Does it matter that you\u2019ve been dumped by your boss? At the end of the day, you\u2019ve still got a better life than we do\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu scoffed. \u201cDid you know that I already found your IP while we were in university?\u201dWu Shuojian\u2019s expression instantly changed. \u201cWhat?\u201dAt the same time, a cold voice sounded out from behind Yu Zhengdu. \u201cWho did you guys say got dumped?\u201dYu Zhengdu turned around. His eyes crinkled into crescents. \u201cBoss, I thought that you weren\u2019t coming?\u201dZhu Yan looked at Shang Que in shock too. \u201cCEO, why are you here?\u201dShang Que\u2019s expression was a bit awkward. \u201cDidn\u2019t you guys tell him to bring his significant other to attend?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Someone at the table asked without any tact at all, \u201cBut you\u2019re not his significant other?\u201dShang Que angrily replied, \u201cBut I want to be his significant other! Is that not okay?!\u201d<b>The author has something to say:</b>Xiaokui: !!! You guys forced me!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 94": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/New Times, New HellChapter 95 - I Agree!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 95 - I Agree!As soon as Shang Que said this, everyone present instantly fell into a suffocating silence.Originally, after he had entered the private room, no one had been able to keep themselves from stopping their own conversations to sneak glances at him. Unknowingly, the room had quieted.Additionally, Shang Que had spoken with an all or nothing kind of impulsivity. His voice had been rather loud. Everyone became completely astounded.Some people even seemed to be hearing echos. A soft voice echoed in their ears\u2014\u2014Everybody froze in place.Even Yu Zhengdu was shocked.After an unknown amount of time, someone finally regained their wits. Zhu Yan stuttered out first, \u201cOkay. Of course it\u2019s okay.\u201dThe other cla.s.smates came back to their senses too. Someone subconsciously wanted to applaud, but quickly got stopped by a keen cla.s.smate. Zhang Qingqing, who was often worried for her cla.s.smates, hurriedly gestured to everyone: Keep calm! Keep calm!Everybody exchanged glances. Finally, they reached a tacit understanding and, by using a great amount of self control, they managed to successfully stop themselves from causing an uproar. Instead, they pretended like nothing had happened\u2026\u2026 Of course, they still couldn\u2019t prevent themselves from occasionally sneaking glances in Yu Zhengdu\u2019s direction.This conscientious behavior allowed Shang Que\u2019s tense nerves to slightly relax.Yu Zhengdu couldn\u2019t help laughing out loud. He stood up and held onto Shang Que\u2019s wrist. \u201cSit down first.\u201dShang Que had originally finally managed to relax a bit. Upon seeing Yu Zhengdu stand up, he instantly stiffened up again. He abruptly took a step forward, standing close to Yu Zhengdu and whispering, \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to reject me in front of so many people!\u201d\u201cIf you have anything to say, you have to wait till we get back!\u201d\u201cSave me some dignity!\u201dYu Zhengdu glanced at him, completely amused. \u201cI never said I was going to reject you.\u201dHis eyes curved into crescents. His lips were quirked up in a smile that couldn\u2019t be hidden. \u201cI\u2019m very happy that you could come.\u201dShang Que momentarily paused.The two of them sat down. At this time, the other cla.s.smates around the table had already finished adjusting their own moods and emotions.Wu Shuojian was still feeling anxious because of the fact that Yu Zhengdu had mentioned finding his IP. However, because of Shang Que\u2019s sudden appearance, Yu Zhengdu had gotten interrupted too. He couldn\u2019t know at all what Yu Zhengdu\u2019s words had meant.He pondered a bit and elbowed his girlfriend. Lowly, he asked, \u201cI think I made Cla.s.smate Yu angry just now. Can you help me ask him what he meant?\u201dHis girlfriend had originally been a bit unhappy because of how mean he had been to her cla.s.smate. Upon seeing that he now seemed regretful, her mood finally recovered a bit. She told Yu Zhengdu, \u201cZhengdu, sorry. Just now, Shuojian didn\u2019t say all those things on purpose. You\u2019re not angry, right?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Yu Zhengdu glanced at his female cla.s.smate. One reason was because Shang Que\u2019s unannounced appearance truly made him not want to bother with Wu Shuojian anymore. Another was that they were in front of so many people, after all. He still needed to be respectful towards women. Thus, he smiled and said, \u201cI was joking too.\u201dHis words allowed Wu Shuojian to relax. He thought to himself, Yu Zhengdu had only been faking it previously. If he really knew who had been spreading rumors about him, would he be able to resist not saying anything for four years?Besides, even if Yu Zhengdu had really traced his IP before, he wasn\u2019t scared.Now that he was no longer worried, Wu Shuojian instantly became unimpressed again. He had finally found an opportunity, after much difficulty, to criticize Yu Zhengdu. How could he have known that Shang Que would suddenly appear? And he had publicly revealed the fact that he wanted to be Yu Zhengdu\u2019s significant other. It made all of Wu Shuojian\u2019s previous attacks seem both ill-intended and comical.Shang Que was also honestly too exemplary. Since his appearance, almost everyone\u2019s gazes had been glued to him.Wu Shuojian heard some cla.s.smates next to him softly whisper to each other, \u201cWow, CEO is really too handsome in person.\u201d\u201cI saw him once at our graduation ceremony, but not this close. He\u2019s really so devastatingly handsome. I\u2019m jealous of Zhengdu!\u201d\u201cWake up. Is CEO only good looking? He\u2019s a big antique collector, a domineering boss!\u201d\u201cThe people on the forum are really so funny. They even said Zhengdu got dumped by CEO!\u201d\u201cThose antifans are like rats in dark sewers. Why bother paying attention to them?\u201dWu Shuojian was extremely displeased in his heart. He honestly couldn\u2019t stop himself from revealing a fake smile and asking, \u201cIs CEO really pursuing Cla.s.smate Yu?\u201dShang Que had finally made the tough decision to come. He was terrified that Yu Zhengdu would reject him. Thus, he couldn\u2019t help acting a bit like an ostrich after expressing his feelings. Naturally, he wasn\u2019t willing to hear anyone bring up this topic again. However, there was someone who very untactfully was mentioning this tabooed topic.Shang Que wasn\u2019t as patient with others as he was with Yu Zhengdu. Additionally, he had heard Wu Shuojian mocking Yu Zhengdu when he had walked in. He had a terrible impression of this person. As such, when Wu Shuojian spoke up, Shang Que gazed coldly at him. He revealed his usual arrogant, apathetic expression. \u201cWhat? I need your approval?\u201dHe wasn\u2019t hiding his aura at all. He also wasn\u2019t bothering to be polite in his speech. As soon as he said this, the scene suddenly quieted. Everyone couldn\u2019t help shrinking in on themselves a bit. The same thought popped up in their minds\u2014\u2014Wu Shuojian\u2019s heart vigorously trembled. He started feeling uncontrollably guilty. Instinctively, he wanted to back away. Only to feel his girlfriend\u2019s foot kicking him under the table. She awkwardly whispered to him, \u201cStop bringing this topic up.\u201dWu Shuojian looked up and discovered that not only his girlfriend, but everyone else at the table was looking at him, speechless. They obviously didn\u2019t agree with his actions. He momentarily felt impossibly embarra.s.sed. This caused him to feel rebellious. With a tone full of implication, he said, \u201cCEO, you\u2019ve misunderstood. I\u2019m just jealous of the fact that Cla.s.smate Yu is so charismatic, you know. No wonder there are so many rumors that say Cla.s.smate Yu has been able to reach his current position and earn his current salary at such a young age solely because of his \u2018good relations.h.i.+p\u2019 with CEO.\u201dHe had originally wanted to say 'special relations.h.i.+p\u201d, but halfway through , Shang Que had given him a death glare. He couldn\u2019t help the fear in his heart, which was why he had changed the phrase to \u201cgood relations.h.i.+p.\u201d However, he was also reluctant to admit defeat, so had emphasized these two words on purpose.All the cla.s.smates present had seen the post on the school forum before. They naturally knew what Wu Shuojian was alluding to. Zhu Yan and Yu Zhengdu were very close friends. Zhu Yan instantly became displeased. \u201cWhy are you talking about the stuff people make up online?\u201dYu Zhengdu had originally wanted to save Wu Shuojian some dignity because of his girlfriend. He hadn\u2019t thought that the other would be so insensible. He quickly furrowed his brows. Just as he was about to act, he heard Shang Que say, \u201cThose things are truly because he has a good relations.h.i.+p with me.\u201dEveryone looked over in shock. Even Wu Shuojian hadn\u2019t thought that he would actually admit this himself. Uncontrollably, satisfaction appeared on his face.Shang Que looked over at Yu Zhengdu slightly reluctantly. \u201cYou only stayed because you have a good relations.h.i.+p with me, right?\u201dWhat else could Yu Zhengdu say? Obviously, he could only smile and answer, \u201cYes.\u201dShang Que finally gently hummed. He continued, \u201cIf not for his good relations.h.i.+p with me, given his current salary and position, he absolutely would\u2019ve already left.\u201dYu Zhengdu felt very wronged, \u201cI wasn\u2019t! I didn\u2019t! Don\u2019t wrong me!\u201dShang Que was normally obsessed with his own dignity, except regarding these situations. Resentfully, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t think I don\u2019t know. That Laboratory still hasn\u2019t given up on you. He secretly gave you an offer with an even higher salary!\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dZhu Yan couldn\u2019t help making a sound of realization. He asked, \u201cSo\u2026\u2026you\u2019ve given him such a high position not because you and Zhengdu have a good relations.h.i.+p, but actually because other people gave Zhengdu a higher salary offer?\u201dShang Que gave him a death stare. \u201cAre you mocking me?\u201dZhu Yan was so scared he kept waving his hands in denial. \u201cNo.\u201dCEO\u2019s aura was too terrifying.Yu Zhengdu instantly knew that Shang Que was still hung up over the situation with Jiao Shanlan. He placated the other, amused, \u201cI\u2019ve already rejected lan\u2026\u2026\u201dBut Shang Que still couldn\u2019t rest at ease. \u201cThere are also other companies who\u2019ve found headhunters to try and steal you\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu was shocked. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d He had never mentioned this to Boss before.Shang Que slightly rolled his eyes. \u201cA headhunter called the wrong number and ended up calling me.\u201dYu Zhengdu quieted for a moment. \u201cSo why didn\u2019t you transfer the call to me?\u201dShang Que immediately placed the blame on the other party. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault. He was the one who lost our argument and hung up first.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dTheir conversation caused the cla.s.smates to become continuously surprised. One cla.s.smate exclaimed, \u201cSo there are actually so many outside companies trying to steal Zhengdu\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que revealed a slightly pleased expression. \u201cSo what if they are? Their bosses don\u2019t have as good of a relations.h.i.+p with Zhengdu as I do.\u201dCla.s.smates: = =Shang Que\u2019s words managed to clear up the rumors on the forum in a roundabout way. Not only so, but Yu Zhengdu\u2019s cla.s.smates gained a brand new understanding about Yu Zhengdu\u2019s status in the industry.In this moment, his cla.s.smates all lamented, \u201cWe clearly all graduated from the same cla.s.s. How come the difference is so huge?\u201dSomeone said with a slight smile, \u201cThe difference already existed in college, okay?!\u201d\u201cExactly. When Zhengdu used the singer account to become famous on starflicker, I was still making up algebra exams\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI remember that prior to graduation, landry had already planned to recruit Zhengdu to his laboratory, right?\u201dBecause of Shang Que, Yu Zhengdu practically had Jiao Shanlan PTSD these days. As soon as he heard his cla.s.smates cuing landry, he hurriedly interrupted, \u201cThose were all things of the past. Don\u2019t mention them anymore. Don\u2019t.\u201dUpon noticing that Yu Zhengdu had once again become everyone\u2019s subject of admiration, Wu Shuojian almost chipped his teeth from how hard he was clenching them together. While Yu Zhengdu interrupted everyone, he scoffed and stated in a pointed tone, \u201cCla.s.smate Yu is valued by his boss so much. No wonder why there were media reports online about how CEO gave Cla.s.smate Yu a famous painting worth one hundred million as overtime pay.\u201dBecause of Yu Zhengdu, these cla.s.smates were all pretty interested in Shang Que\u2019s gossip news. A lot of people present had also read that \u201covertime pay\u201d report. They naturally knew about the netizen\u2019s denial of the rumors.Because that news article had honestly been too outrageous, n.o.body had taken it seriously at all. How could Wu Shuojian not know that the news in the report had only been made up to garner attention? He was suddenly bringing it up purely to disgust Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que.However, before Yu Zhengdu could speak, Zhu Yan couldn\u2019t take it anymore first. He asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Why do you keep mentioning the rumors online? Anyone with a brain knows that n.o.body would use a famous painting worth over a hundred million as overtime pay!\u201dAt this time, Wu Shuojian was already on the brink of going crazy because of how much he had to control himself. He was determined to insult Yu Zhengdu a few times. He chuckled coldly and said, \u201cWell I just thought that someone as bada.s.s as Cla.s.smate Yu maybe really would deserve such impressive overtime pay!\u201d\u201cYou thought what?!\u201d Zhu Yan could finally tell that Wu Shuojian was saying all this on purpose. His tone became rather rude too. \u201cCEO refuted the rumors long ago. Seems to me like you\u2019re just being intentional!\u201dWu Shuojian still wanted to say more. Shang Que suddenly asked, bewildered, \u201cWhat did I refute rumors about?\u201dZhu Yan: \u201cAbout how you gave that famous painting to Zhengdu as overtime pay.\u201dShang Que: \u201cThose aren\u2019t rumors. That was real.\u201dTheir cla.s.smates instantly turned their gazes over. Zhu Yan sputtered, \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell a netizen that you didn\u2019t give the painting to Zhengdu? Could it be that the screenshot of the private message the netizen posted was photoshopped?\u201dShang Que thought about it before suddenly reaching a realization. \u201cOh, that. That\u2019s real.\u201dTheir cla.s.smates heaved out a sigh of relief. They knew that n.o.body could possibly give overtime pay valuing over one hundred million.Only to hear Shang Que continue, \u201cUnfortunately, he refused to accept it.\u201dZhu Yan: \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201dShang Que furrowed his brows. \u201cIs that very hard to understand?\u201dA cla.s.smate asked Shang Que, voice shaking, \u201cCould it be that you mean you really gave the famous painting worth over a hundred million to Zhengdu as overtime pay?\u201dShang Que made a soft sound of acknowledgment and nodded.\u201cOnly, Zhengdu didn\u2019t accept it?\u201dShang Que nodded again. His tone even sounded a bit reluctant. \u201cHe thought that the reason \u2018overtime pay\u2019 wasn\u2019t reasonable. But it\u2019s clearly very reasonable!\u201dThese cla.s.smates all spat out a mouthful of blood in their hearts. They had known that there were differences between people, but they hadn\u2019t known that these differences could be so extreme.Everyone had all graduated from the same school. Many of them were still tirelessly working on the front lines. Someone, however, was already a CTO; being pursued by a tall, rich, handsome man; and owned over one hundred million in overtime pay\u2014\u2014and he had rejected it!One cla.s.smate glanced over at Yu Zhengdu in despair. He very truthfully said, \u201cZhengdu, during future cla.s.s gatherings, if there\u2019s no absolute need, maybe don\u2019t attend?\u201dEveryone instantly nodded. \u201cPlease allow the rest of us to have some life goals!\u201dYu Zhengdu said after brief thought, \u201cI can pay.\u201dHis cla.s.smates immediately changed their minds. \u201cThen you should come!\u201d\u201cYou need to come. If anyone doesn\u2019t let you come, I\u2019m going to get angry at them.\u201dEveryone started lamenting once more. After, Zhu Yan angrily said, \u201cI really feel more outraged the more I think about this. Clearly Zhengdu earned all of this because of his own hard work, but people on the school forum are still making up a bunch of random s.h.i.+t! And their words are so demeaning!\u201dEveryone else nodded in agreement. \u201cThey\u2019re too much. We need to refute those rumors when we get back.\u201d\u201cWho made up all those rumors? They must have an enmity with Zhengdu!\u201d\u201cWhat kind of person are they? So ign.o.ble.\u201dYu Zhengdu said, \u201cI know who it is.\u201dEveryone looked over. \u201cHuh?\u201dYu Zhengdu\u2019s gaze overlooked everyone else and landed directly on Wu Shuojian. While smiling, he asked, \u201cCla.s.smate Wu, have you come up with a way to admit your mistakes and apologize yet?\u201dOriginally, because of the other\u2019s girlfriend, Yu Zhengdu hadn\u2019t actually wanted to embarra.s.s Wu Shuojian in front of so many people. However, Wu Shuojian didn\u2019t appear to be feeling regretful at all. He had even gotten increasingly worse, breaching Yu Zhengdu\u2019s bottom line.As soon as Yu Zhengdu said this, everyone was bewildered. Wu Shuojian\u2019s girlfriend thought that he was angry because of the fact that Wu Shuojian had continuously brought up the rumors from online. She hurriedly said, \u201cZhengdu, Shuojian isn\u2019t that good at saying the right thing. He\u2019s not being intentional. Don\u2019t take things to heart\u2026\u2026\u201dHow could Wu Shuojian not be shocked too? He had incessantly said bad things about Yu Zhengdu on the forum for so many years, yet had never been exposed by anyone. This was the reason he had become more and more fearless. Earlier, though Yu Zhengdu had warned him prior to Shang Que\u2019s arrival, because of his later change in att.i.tude, Wu Shuojian had only thought that Yu Zhengdu was scaring him.He had never expected that Yu Zhengdu would use this chance to attack him.Yu Zhengdu glanced at Wu Shuojian\u2019s girlfriend. He stated, \u201cHe is being intentional.\u201d\u201cThis person is of terrible moral character. It\u2019d be better for you to break up with him sooner.\u201dWu Shuojian\u2019s shame turned into anger. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201cI already told you. I tracked your IP during university.\u201dWu Shuojian\u2019s heart was on a roller coaster ride, but he still forced himself to sound calm. \u201cWhy were you tracking my IP?\u201dZhu Yan thought of something. \u201cCould it be that he also said bad things about you on the forum?\u201d\u201c ,\u201d Yu Zhengdu nodded. Then, he named an ID. He stared straight at Wu Shuojian. \u201cYour username isn\u2019t that great, just like your person.\u201dThere was a sudden uproar in the private room. Their entire cla.s.s recognized this ID: this wasn\u2019t your usual Yu Zhengdu antifan. Instead, it was Yu Zhengdu\u2019s most famous antifan during college.Wu Shuojian\u2019s girlfriend looked at Wu Shuojian in disbelief. \u201cIt was actually you?\u201dShang Que\u2019s brows furrowed. He revealed a meaningful expression. \u201cSo he\u2019s the demon .\u201d\u201cQuit pouring the blame on me.\u201d Wu Shuojian was already completely panicked. He was astounded because he had never thought that Yu Zhengdu had really known that he was the one behind the ID. The other had never said anything, but this hadn\u2019t been because of fear. Wu Shuojian forced himself to confidently say, \u201cIf you\u2019re so capable, bring out the proof.\u201dAt this time, Zhu Yan asked, confused, \u201cCould it be a mistake? Though he\u2019s very annoying, I checked that antifan\u2019s IP address too. I don\u2019t think it was his?\u201dEveryone in Yu Zhengdu\u2019s cla.s.s had learned computer science before. Tracing an IP address wasn\u2019t very difficult. Zhu Yan had checked it before too.\u201c , he often uses proxy IPs,\u201d Yu Zhengdu said.Wu Shuojian laughed coldly. \u201cRight now, you\u2019re saying all this without proof.\u201dYu Zhengdu scoffed as well. \u201cYou can\u2019t honestly believe that tracking IPs is the only thing I know how to do?\u201dWu Shuojian\u2019s heart suddenly skipped a beat. He had originally thought that because he had made up bad rumors about Yu Zhengdu for four years but the other had never said anything, Yu Zhengdu either didn\u2019t care or couldn\u2019t find out.But what if it was only because Yu Zhengdu had been too lazy to speak up?Given Yu Zhengdu\u2019s skills\u2026\u2026Yu Zhengdu truly hadn\u2019t wanted to bother saying anything in the past. Only a few things could possibly happen on campus. Additionally, he had many fans, which made things difficult for antifans. Occasionally, Wu Shuojian even provided some comedic relief, so Yu Zhengdu had allowed him to do as he wished.But Wu Shuojian was still hara.s.sing him to this day. He had also gotten increasingly bolder, creating disgusting rumors out of the blue. Yu Zhengdu could no longer keep ignoring him.Coincidentally, after Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que\u2019s rumored relations.h.i.+p got uploaded to the forum, Wu Shuojian took this opportunity to say bad things about him again. However, he just so happened to get seen by Shang Que. While displeased, Shang Que had made an account and started arguing back and forth with him.Shang Que was the type of person who absolutely needed to win during online arguments. Unfortunately, Wu Shuojian was an enduring opponent. In the end, Shang Que told Yu Zhengdu to write a tracking software specially designed to track Wu Shuojian\u2019s activity. This would make things easier for him to immediately log on and argue with Wu Shuojian\u2026\u2026These tracking records were the best evidence.Yu Zhengdu naturally wouldn\u2019t reveal the truth behind the reason he had designed the tracking software. Thus, his cla.s.smates all believed that he had specially created it to track his antifans. As such, everything seemed more credible.Wu Shuojian\u2019s girlfriend was speechless. After a long pause, she shot up and lunged away from him. \u201cHoly motherf.u.c.king s.h.i.+t!!\u201dIn the face of evidence, Wu Shuojian had nothing to deny. He observed all the unfriendly gazes in the room and felt a chill crawl up his spine.Zhu Yan suddenly exploded. He charged to the doorway of the private room and slammed the door shut. Then, he started cackling. \u201cThe doors are closed! Time to beat the dog!\u201dWu Shuojian was trembling. He made his last attempt to fight back. \u201cI did say bad things about Yu Zhengdu in the past. So what? I\u2019m not the only one who said bad things about him on the forum. Is there a need to be like this?\u201d\u201cQuit dragging other people into this,\u201d Zhu Yan spat out. \u201cIf you can find someone who\u2019s said more bad things about him than you, we\u2019ll spare you this time.\u201dWu Shuojian tensed.Among Yu Zhengdu\u2019s various antifans, he was absolutely the brightest and most enduring star. At least, n.o.body on the Fu City University Forum could be compared to him.\u201cYou can\u2019t, right?!\u201d Zhu Yan cracked his wrists. \u201cThen don\u2019t blame us for being so impolite!\u201d\u201cWait a moment!\u201d At this critical moment, an ID flashed through Wu Shuojian\u2019s mind. \u201cSomeone might have posted more characters than me.\u201dZhu Yan: \u201cWho?\u201dWu Shuojian glanced at Shang Que. \u201cThe ID that\u2019s pretending to be CEO. From Today On I Will Be A European G.o.d.\u201dAs soon as he said this ID, the entire scene suddenly fell silent.Speaking of, this ID was very infamous too. Though it had only been created for a very short time, the person behind it had a strange overabundance of energy. Since the account had been created, it had claimed to be CEO as it chased Wu Shuojian\u2019s ID around and argued with him. Not only so, but it had dug out all the posts Wu Shuojian had made in the past and cussed them out.Because of him, Wu Shuojian\u2019s previous posts had all gotten continuously b.u.mped up to the top.Thus, though he was helping Yu Zhengdu speak up, everyone all believed that he was even worse than the antifans. In addition to the fact that he was using the same ID as CEO, and also occasionally seemed like an elementary schooler during arguments, everyone all believed that this was both CEO and Senior\u2019s antifan: one fan who was equivalent to ten other antifans.If they were getting technical, because this ID was really reluctant to admit defeat and was determined to vanquish Wu Shuojian, it was honestly quite likely that the number of characters he had posted in total was more than Wu Shuojian\u2019s total count.As such, everyone\u2019s feelings were a bit conflicted when speaking about this ID.How could Wu Shuojian not feel like lamenting either? Thinking back, he had been undefeated on the forum for so many years. This had been the first time that he had deleted an account on the forum because of arguing\u2014\u2014this was also one of the reasons he had switched to a new account later.\u201cThere was a period of time when that ID kept pretending to be CEO and pursuing you,\u201d Zhu Yan couldn\u2019t resist telling Yu Zhengdu. \u201cZhengdu, how about you find him too? Warn him to stop saying so much random stuff. It\u2019s a bad influence.\u201dYu Zhengdu gave Zhu Yan a deadpan look.Zhu Yan was bewildered, \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018pretending\u2019?\u201d Only to hear Shang Que speak up, voice ice cold and tone extremely displeased. \u201cThat\u2019s really me.\u201dZhu Yan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dEveryone else: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWu Shuojian: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe image of a cold, domineering boss, slowly being ruined\u2026\u2026Because such an occurrence had happened halfway through the gathering, all of Yu Zhengdu\u2019s cla.s.smates couldn\u2019t help reminiscing memories from many years ago. This meal lasted a long time. By the time they all went their separate ways, it was already late at night.After learning that Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que were still in that ambiguous stage of their relations.h.i.+p, Yu Zhengdu\u2019s cla.s.smates very conscientiously left them some s.p.a.ce. n.o.body dared to head in the same direction as them.The two of them weren\u2019t in a rush to head back either. They slowly strolled along the sidewalk.Things had been fine when there had been a lot of people present, but now that they were interacting in private, Shang Que couldn\u2019t help feeling nervous again. He had held himself back for half the day. Now, he suddenly pulled out a painting scroll from who knows where and handed it to Yu Zhengdu. \u201cFor you.\u201dYu Zhengdu\u2019s eyes were tinted with faint amus.e.m.e.nt. \u201cHave you come up with a reason this time?\u201dShang Que slightly tightened his grip on the painting. \u201c .\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c ?\u201dShang Que suddenly turned his head away. He didn\u2019t dare to look at Yu Zhengdu. \u201cYou want to reject me, right?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Yu Zhengdu had consumed a bit of alcohol. He was in a good mood, but his mind wasn\u2019t very clear. He used one hand to caress Shang Que\u2019s face. \u201cI like you too.\u201dShang Que\u2019s entire being froze.A long time later, he finally turned his head back. His expression was indescribably ecstatic.\u201cI agree!\u201d Shang Que said.Yu Zhengdu: ??????<b>The author has something to say:</b>Xiaokui: At the end of the day, it was still I who agreed to him!!

Slightly dazed, he stared at the other.The light from the streetlamp landed on Shang Que\u2019s face at an angle, placing a faint halo over his sharply defined features. There was great joy on his face; the corners of his lips were also uncontrollably quirking up. A long time later, he finally said, \u201cYou should\u2019ve told me you liked me earlier. Actually\u2026\u2026\u201dHe stared straight into Yu Zhengdu\u2019s eyes. Those deep dark pupils that never reflected anything surprisingly seemed to hold Yu Zhengdu\u2019s reflection in them. He solemnly stated, \u201cI like you too.\u201d\u2026\u2026It had to be said that this \u201ctoo\u201d had been used very ingeniously.But Yu Zhengdu couldn\u2019t stop himself from smiling. He was obviously delighted. After, he seriously nodded too. \u201c , I like you a lot.\u201dThe moment he finished saying this, their surroundings seemed to suddenly quiet. It was almost as if even the air around them had stopped flowing. Only their gazes on each other remained.Shang Que was normally proud and haughty. At this time, though, he looked a bit helpless. A long time pa.s.sed before he finally asked Yu Zhengdu with uncertainty, \u201cSo are we technically together now?\u201dYu Zhengdu couldn\u2019t help softly chuckling. \u201cDo you want to be together with me?\u201dWithout any hesitation, Shang Que said, \u201cYes.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201cThen yes, we are together.\u201dAt the same time, the LED screen on the skysc.r.a.per in the heart of downtown changed colors, indicating that a new day had arrived.Yu Zhengdu was contemplative. He pulled out his phone and checked the time \u2013 as expected, the date had already changed. It was exactly the date that the Life Management App had predicted would be the day he and Shang Que officially confirmed their romantic relations.h.i.+p.Yu Zhengdu lamented, \u201cOur system\u2019s big data fortune telling is actually quite accurate.\u201d\u201cDoes it dare to be inaccurate?!\u201d Shang Que slightly lifted up his chin. His tone carried a hint of smugness.Yu Zhengdu burst into laughter. \u201c , it doesn\u2019t dare.\u201dThe evening wind blew past. His delicate features became even more discernible under the glow of the streetlamp. Shang Que\u2019s heart started beating faster. He grabbed the other\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m a little bit happy.\u201dYu Zhengdu c.o.c.ked an eyebrow. \u201cA little bit?\u201d\u201c ,\u201d Shang Que nodded in a reserved manner. After brief thought, he hesitantly added, \u201cA big little bit.\u201dThis time, Yu Zhengdu could no longer stop himself from bursting into laughter. Then, as Shang Que started looking embarra.s.sed, he sincerely stated, \u201cBut I\u2019m very happy.\u201dShang Que\u2019s expression instantly brightened. He immediately replied, \u201cActually, I\u2019m very happy too.\u201dHe kept a slightly tight grip over Yu Zhengdu\u2019s hand. His tone was tentative. \u201cWhen you confirm a relations.h.i.+p in the mortal realm, do you need to perform some special ceremonies?\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201cFor example?\u201dShang Que suddenly risked it all as he forcefully tugged Yu Zhengdu closer. When the other was in his embrace, he wrapped both arms around him. \u201cI want to kiss you a little bit.\u201d\u201cA big little bit\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cActually, I really want to kiss you.\u201dHe didn\u2019t wait for Yu Zhengdu to reply. Instead, he corrected his own wording, then slightly lowered his head and kissed Yu Zhengdu\u2019s hair.Yu Zhengdu hugged him back.Because of this, Shang Que lifted his head up again. He cradled Yu Zhengdu\u2019s face in his hands and kissed him once more.Luofeng Employee Mini Groupchat (Groupchat Without Boss)Kang Jin:\u3010Haha, we don\u2019t need to go to work tomorrow.

Not only so, but they also exposed Wu Shuojian to be the famous antifan who had made up innumerous rumors about Yu Zhengdu. Additionally, they had provided the related evidence.After being published, this post instantly caused an uproar in the forum. In the face of evidence, Wu Shuojian could no longer deny anything. He immediately became a public enemy; apparently, someone felt so angry that they had reported him to his current workplace. They felt that someone with intentions as dark as his shouldn\u2019t continue working in law.Even so, there were still some people who felt suspicious about Yu Zhengdu. They thought that confirming Wu Shuojian\u2019s ident.i.ty as the antifan could only prove that the post was purposefully intended to attack Yu Zhengdu. However, it couldn\u2019t entirely prove that the content in that post was completely false.Yu Zhengdu\u2019s achievements were too astonis.h.i.+ng. There were always people who refused to accept them. Otherwise, the original post that had made up all those rumors wouldn\u2019t have been believed by so many people.However, these comments didn\u2019t receive much support, because very quickly, someone added a new post to the forum. This post encompa.s.sed information from the headhunters\u2019 inner circles.Only then did everyone realize that there were so many companies in the tech industry who wanted to steal Yu Zhengdu away. Additionally, the prices they were offering were way higher than everyone\u2019s a.s.sumptions.All the alumni of Fu City University who were currently working more or less knew a few headhunters. Similar news wasn\u2019t hard to get a hold of. Very quickly, other people came out to prove that this was all true.As such, the rumors quickly became disproved.However, discussions regarding Yu Zhengdu didn\u2019t fade away so quickly because the forum\u2019s famous new ID, the one that seemed to be Yu Zhengdu\u2019s boss \u2013 From Today On I Will Be A European G.o.d \u2013 logged on and cussed out all of the comments that were suspecting Yu Zhengdu. His style was a bit elementary schooler-like, as usual. People couldn\u2019t tell if this was a fan or a high-level antifan.Strangely, everytime this account would appear in the past, Yu Zhengdu\u2019s cla.s.smates would all pop up and lecture him, asking him to stop using CEO\u2019s ident.i.ty to garner antifans for Yu Zhengdu.But after this incident, Yu Zhengdu\u2019s cla.s.smates either all silently watched on or commented in agreement with this account\u2019s arguments. They even helped smooth over difficult situations for this account.This truly caused the students of Fu City University to feel very perplexed.The long awaited mysterious vacation was actually the Ghost King\u2019s escape from singlehood vacation. This news caused all of Luofeng\u2019s employees to feel like they were hallucinating.Ultimately, Kang Jin\u2019s grave disco party turned into a silent music event. n.o.body had the energy to dance or speak. Apparently, that ghost who had gone to practice his ghost car drifting skills had almost gotten into a car accident.The break quickly pa.s.sed. On the day everyone returned to work, n.o.body had recovered yet. As soon as Yu Zhengdu walked into the company, he discovered that the entire office had fallen into a stifling silence.Yu Zhengdu asked with a smile, \u201cThere\u2019s no need for everyone to be so surprised, right?\u201dKang Jin appeared dazed. He replied completely out of instinct, \u201cThat\u2019s the Ghost King. The Ghost King of Luofeng Mountain who has been single for a thousand years\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu fell temporarily silent. He asked, \u201cThen shouldn\u2019t everyone feel even happier? The old, single youth has finally resolved his singlehood issues.\u201dEveryone: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWas that your usual old, single youth?Kang Jin weakly stared at him. His gaze was filled with slight complaint, but he didn\u2019t dare to express this feeling too obviously. \u201cBut, how could he be dating you\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu quieted for a moment. \u201cIs that very strange?\u201d\u201cEnough. Go work,\u201d Lu Lingxi interrupted. Then, she looked at Yu Zhengdu. \u201cXiao Yu, let\u2019s go to the meeting room. I have some things to tell you.\u201dYu Zhengdu followed Lu Lingxi into the office. Only to see Lu Lingxi\u2019s solemn expression.He asked, confused, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dLu Lingxi looked at him. \u201cYou\u2019re really dating Boss?\u201dYu Zhengdu nodded. He could sense that her mood seemed slightly off. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dLu Lingxi fell momentarily silent before asking, \u201cSo when are you guys planning on breaking up?\u201dYu Zhengdu c.o.c.ked an eyebrow. \u201cWho asks questions like that?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m being serious.\u201d Lu Lingxi waved her hands around. Her expression seemed very conflicted as she gazed at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve been working at this company for so long. You can\u2019t not know about humans and ghosts having different paths, right?\u201dYu Zhengdu paused for a moment. He naturally knew about the phrase \u201chumans and ghosts have different paths.\u201dHe leaned against the back of the chair and smiled, \u201cI\u2019ve thought about it.\u201dFor him, having a shorter or shortened lifespan were things that could be overcome.\u201cThat\u2019s not it,\u201d Lu Lingxi said.The problem of humans and ghosts having different paths wasn\u2019t only manifested in shortened lifespans. This was a difference between the mortal and Underworld \u2013 these were already two completely separate worlds. The questions involved weren\u2019t only as simple as regarding life and death.Lu Lingxi expressed her great worry, \u201cIt\u2019s normal for you not to know about these things, but how could Boss also be so impulsive?\u201dYu Zhengdu said with a smile, \u201cHe\u2019s an old house on fire , you know? He\u2019s already been single for a thousand years. Isn\u2019t it normal to be a bit impulsive?\u201dLu Lingxi was rendered temporarily speechless. \u201cYou\u2019re still in the mood to make jokes?\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201cBecause people who have just started dating are all in good moods.\u201dLu Lingxi: \u201c\u2026\u2026You\u2019re not worried about yourself at all?\u201dYu Zhengdu smiled at her. He placated, \u201cI\u2019ll take care of things. Don\u2019t worry.\u201dJust as they finished speaking, the door to the conference room got pushed open. Shang Que peeked in and glanced at Yu Zhengdu. \u201cSo you\u2019re here.\u201dYu Zhengdu said with a grin, \u201cHaving a meeting with Manager Lu.\u201d\u201cHow come you\u2019re so busy so early in the morning? Shang Que furrowed his brows. \u201cWhen will the meeting end?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s already ended.\u201d Yu Zhengdu stood up. \u201cDo you need something?\u201dShang Que: \u201cI want to go check on Peppa with you.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201cOkay.\u201dShang Que cheerily added, \u201cWe need to let Peppa know as soon as possible that she\u2019s not the child of a single parent family anymore.\u201dLu Lingxi from behind them: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d<b>The author has something to say:</b>Peppa: Ga!

Suddenly, he heard a commotion outside. A girl from administration knocked on the door in agitation. \u201cYu ge, your duck\u2019s going crazy.\u201dA string of question marks popped up over Yu Zhengdu\u2019s head. He hurriedly stood up and walked out, only to hear shrill sounds of \u201cgua gua gua gua\u201d from the direction of his work station. A group of coworkers were crowded around that location, pointing and gawking. As soon as they noticed him, they immediately gestured for him to come. \u201cLeader, hurry and come. Your duck seems to have gotten possessed\u2014\u2014\u201dSomeone was speaking while trying to placate the duck. However, as soon as that person approached, he instantly got slapped by the duck\u2019s wings. Someone had also accidentally gotten pecked. His screech of \u201cao\u2014\u2014\u201d reached every corner of the office. He instantly became teary-eyed. \u201cThis duck is too vicious!\u201dYu Zhengdu: = =He walked closer and looked. As expected, the duck was extremely excited. When she saw him, she started flapping her wings even faster. She even started turning circles in the nest. \u201cGua gua\u2014\u2014gua gua\u2014\u2014\u201dA coworker felt incredibly bewildered upon seeing this. \u201cIs it doing ballet?\u201dThe duck spread out both its wings and protected the hatching nest. \u201cGua gua\u2014\u2014gua gua\u2014\u2014\u201dYu Zhengdu had an epiphany. He took out his phone and calculated the time that had pa.s.sed. Then, he went on high alert. \u201cI think the gosling is going to hatch!\u201dThe duck spread her wings: \u201cGua\u2014\u2014\u201dHis coworkers fell into great confusion. \u201cPrior to the hatching of an egg, ducks will notify you in advance?\u201dNormal ducks obviously wouldn\u2019t, but this duck had been threatened by the Ghost King before. It didn\u2019t dare to not notify them.Yu Zhengdu acted like he couldn\u2019t hear his coworkers\u2019 questions. He sent Shang Que a message:\u3010Peppa\u2019s about to be born.\u3011Less than a minute after he sent the message, Shang Que\u2019s voice sounded out behind them. It carried a hint of nervousness. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201dTheir surrounding coworkers instantly greeted him. Someone asked in surprise, \u201cBoss Shang got here so quick. Were you coincidentally already here?\u201dLiu Wei inquired with wide eyes, \u201cBoss\u2019s equipment looks so familiar?\u201dYu Zhengdu turned around and looked. He felt astonished too.Only to see that Shang Que was wearing a neat and tidy suit; from his shoulder hung a\u2026\u2026dad diaper bag?Shang Que stood up straight. Coldly, he shooed the other coworkers away. \u201cWhat\u2019s there to stare at? It\u2019s just a gosling hatching. Hurry and get back to work.\u201dThe big boss had spoken. The employees didn\u2019t dare to not listen. They could only silently disperse. However, this didn\u2019t stop them from frequently looking back while walking away. They muttered to themselves, \u201cIf a gosling hatching isn\u2019t interesting, then why is Boss Shang here?\u201d\u201cThe stuff Boss Shang is carrying\u2026\u2026seems to be stuff for infants?\u201d\u201cSpeaking of, I think Boss Shang has been coming over to check on the goose egg every day this past period of time?\u201d\u201cWow, what a boss with a double standard!\u201dAfter everyone had walked away, Shang Que finally scoffed. He lowered his voice and told Yu Zhengdu, \u201cThese people are honestly so unconscientious. How dare they surround this area? Do they want to be Peppa\u2019s imprinted dads?\u201dOviparous animals all imprinted. They would instinctively stick to the first living thing they saw after hatching. Shang Que naturally couldn\u2019t allow anyone else to appear in Peppa\u2019s field of vision during her birth.Not only so, he also coldly glanced at the big white duck. \u201cLeave.\u201dThe big white duck didn\u2019t even dare to make a peep. She obediently hopped out of the hatching nest, squeezed her wings to her body, and quickly waddled away.Yu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter removing all living animals other than Yu Zhengdu, Shang Que took off the dad diaper bag and started pulling stuff out from it.A mini heat lamp, a tiny new nest, a little milk bottle for water, glucose, fresh gra.s.s in a box, vegetable leaves, crushed corn, bone powder, etc. There were also a bunch of other random things, including a tiny little square box.Yu Zhengdu stared at the small box in confusion. \u201cThis is?\u201d\u201cGosling swimming pool.\u201d While speaking, Shang Que also pulled out a tiny, palm-sized swim ring. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Peppa will be born knowing how to swim. It\u2019ll be safer to prepare a swim ring too.\u201dYu Zhengdu almost choked. \u201c\u2026\u2026You really thought of everything.\u201dShang Que with a cold expression: \u201cI read a goose raising manual in advance.\u201dYu Zhengdu felt greatly ashamed. \u201cI\u2019m really an unqualified father.\u201d\u201cHow are you unqualified? You\u2019re busy with work.\u201d As Shang Que spoke, he reached out and gently stroked the top of Yu Zhengdu\u2019s head. He revealed a comforting smile. \u201cAs long as I\u2019m standing behind you, everything will be fine.\u201dIt had to be said that when Shang Que said things like this, his aura was very powerful and convincing.\u2026\u2026If the situation in question wasn\u2019t related to raising a goose, it would definitely be more touching.Just as they were conversing, that giant goose egg in the hatching nest gently trembled. Shang Que instantly grabbed onto Yu Zhengdu\u2019s hand. \u201cShe\u2019s coming out!\u201dA little hole got pecked into the white egg sh.e.l.l. A faint, almost unnoticeable avian call sounded out from inside. The little hole became bigger and bigger. A tiny little goose beak \u2013 that looked like a sunflower seed \u2013 peeked out.Shang Que had originally been observing the movements around the goose egg, completely focused. Upon seeing that the goose beak had already popped out, he suddenly froze, though. After brief thought, he stepped back a little bit and gently pushed Yu Zhengdu forward.Yu Zhengdu was slightly surprised. \u201c ?\u201dAt the same time, a faint yellow, fuzzy, and wet head poked out from the hole in the egg sh.e.l.l. Two little beady black eyes made eye contact with Yu Zhengdu.The gosling stretched out its neck and released a soft, \u201cGe\u2014\u2014ge\u2014\u2014\u201dYu Zhengdu\u2019s eyes instantly softened. He revealed a faint smile and lowly replied, \u201cPeppa, we\u2019re finally meeting again.\u201dAt this time, Shang Que finally scooted up close. He stared at the gosling for a while before suddenly saying, \u201cCall me Dad.\u201dYu Zhengdu glanced askance at the other and moved closer to him. \u201c , this is your dad too.\u201dBecause both Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que lived alone, meaning there was no one at home when they were at work, and because Peppa was still a newborn gosling, they naturally couldn\u2019t rest at ease if they left her alone at home. Thus, they simply decided to let her continue living at the company. In the day, they could take care of her. At night, they could take her home, depending on the circ.u.mstances. If something came up, rendering it inconvenient to take her home, there would still be Luofeng\u2019s ghost employees taking care of her at the company. She wouldn\u2019t be unsupervised.Originally, Yu Zhengdu wanted to take Peppa back to the Luofeng headquarters. After all, the employees on that side all knew exactly what was going on with Peppa. However, considering the fact that Luofeng was full of ghosts and Peppa had just been born, it would be better for her to stay at a location that was full of life. As such, he decided to keep her on the Amazing Future side first until she finished molting.Fortunately, raising a gosling didn\u2019t take up too much s.p.a.ce. Additionally, Shang Que had already given Peppa a human consciousness when she had hatched. Though she was a waterfowl, she could slowly learn human habits and knowledge, just like a human child. More accurately speaking, because their rates for development were different, Peppa\u2019s learning speed was actually faster than that of normal children.However, a mild misunderstanding happened halfway through. After Luofeng\u2019s employees learned that Peppa had finally hatched, they all rushed over to visit her, not forgetting to bring little gifts. Their serious att.i.tude towards the hatching of a gosling had already caused Amazing Future\u2019s employees great shock. On top of this, one Luofeng employee hadn\u2019t carefully considered and had carried a bag of chicken eggs to visit.Everyone at Amazing Future: \u201c\u2026\u2026??\u201dAt first, Amazing Future\u2019s silly programmers thought that CTO, Big Boss, and their coworkers at headquarters\u2019 behavior was very strange. However, the ability of humans regarding acceptance and adaptation was astonis.h.i.+ngly great.In only a few days, not only had the programmers started accepting this, they had even involuntarily joined the gosling care group.After all, a lifetime of writing code was extremely boring. Being able to observe a fuzzy little gosling at work could be considered a rather excellent leisurely activity.Thus, quite soon after, some strange posts started appearing in a few technological forums and discussion groups for the Internet industry.Heading: Click Here to See A Fresh GoslingHeading: Shocked! Our Boss is Raising a Peppa in His OfficeHeading: She\u2019s So CuteHeading: I Specially Brought Her Breakfast, But She Kicked it Over\u2026\u2026However, I\u2019m Still Completely Obsessed With HerVery quickly, Peppa Goose\u2019s HD photos had been spread all over the industry. Many of those in the same field all knew that Amazing Future was raising a little gosling in their office. Thus, they became bewildered.\u3010There must be something wrong. Why would they name it Peppa? I thought that they were raising a miniature pig in their office\u3011\u3010Programmers are honestly very crazy. Obsessing over dogs and cats is whatever. Now they\u2019re starting to obsess over geese?\u3011\u3010Upstairs, don\u2019t generalize. Only Amazing Future\u2019s programmers are this crazy\u3011\u3010But keeping a fuzzy little pet in the office is truly very stress-relieving! It would be so nice if our company could raise one too!\u3011\u3010It only seems stress-relieving. Avian animals aren\u2019t like dogs and cats. They can\u2019t be taught at all. They\u2019ll run all over the place, screech all the time, and p.o.o.p in random places. Raising one isn\u2019t as nice as it looks at all.\u3011\u3010I heard someone at Amazing Future say that their company\u2019s goose and duck are both very magical. They\u2019re even smarter than cats and dogs. They won\u2019t make any noises during work and know how to go to the office bathroom to p.o.o.p??\u3011\u3010Upstairs, keep listening to Amazing Future bluff. How could you believe someone who\u2019s saying that ducks and geese are smarter than cats and dogs?\u3011Similar suspicions existed in the field. A majority of people believed that raising ducks and geese in the office wasn\u2019t very suitable. Doing so made it very easy to upset normal work order. There were even some people who suspected that this was a way Amazing Future was trying to garner attention: they were purposefully using this topic as a way to pique people\u2019s interest. Quite a few people agreed with this sentiment.Trying to gain attention was something that had been happening in the Internet industry for a long time. Because good programmers were rather rare, there was a lot of compet.i.tion when companies started hiring. They would come up with numerous different promotional tactics to get people interested. Varying boasts about employee benefits ranged from normal ones such as employee cafeterias and work environments to controversial ones such as the supposed \u201cprogrammer encouragement expert.\u201d For the latter, companies would find beautiful women with big chests to encourage the programmers. Some companies also had \u201cpet days.\u201d On special days, they allowed employees to bring their cats to work.As such, as soon as the news about Amazing Future raising a goose in their office got out, it wasn\u2019t unusual for some people in the industry to think that this was only a way they were trying to gain attention.However, not long after these questioning voices made their presence known, Shang Que\u2019s Weibo suddenly became very active.From Today On I Will Be A European G.o.d: One week old Peppa and her dad [Picture]The attached photo was Yu Zhengdu\u2019s side profile as he worked. A light yellow gosling balanced on his shoulder and stared diligently at the computer screen with him.From Today On I Will Be A European G.o.d: Sleeping Peppa [Picture]The attached photo was the gosling laying in a hood covered with a layer of cotton. Some sharp-eyed netizens very quickly recognized this to be\u2014\u2014the hood of the sweats.h.i.+rt that Senior often wore.From Today On I Will Be A European G.o.d: Peppa\u2019s new nest, very dense with growth [Picture]This picture was of Peppa obediently squatting on a fluffy, dense head of hair. This density\u2026\u2026without a doubt, this was Senior\u2019s hair.Netizens:\u3010\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u3011\u3010Goodness, this goose is a little too cute and obedient!\u3011\u3010????? I\u2019ve become very bewildered. Is this really the legendary goose of society ? Are they this obedient when young?\u3011\u3010You guys are actually looking at the goose?? My eyes are completely glued to Senior\u2019s handsome side profile, okay? Slowly starting to nosebleed\u3011\u3010\u2026\u2026A goose named Peppa or the goose\u2019s dad. As of this moment, I don\u2019t know which one to complain about\u3011\u3010Is Senior really a programmer? He has even denser hair than me!!!!\u3011\u3010I love Peppa Goose. Since CEO\u2019s company has started raising her, Senior\u2019s appearance rate on CEO\u2019s Weibo has increased exponentially. I\u2019m so blessed [holding heart]\u3011\u3010Am I the only who feels like CEO is publicly showing off his goose but is actually secretly showing off Senior?\u3011How many followers did Shang Que have? Because of how often he was posting pictures of his goose, his posts very quickly got reposted to the internal communications of the Internet industry.\u3010Amazing Future\u2019s Peppa Goose really seems so well behaved\u3011\u3010The duck looks really obedient too\u2026\u2026\u3011\u3010Quit it. Who doesn\u2019t know how to take posed pictures?\u3011\u3010A posed picture can make a goose sleep in singer\u2019s hood so obediently? Can make a goose squat on singer\u2019s head?\u3011\u3010 Hehe , if you\u2019re so capable, upload a video\u3011Amazing Future\u2019s employees were really very capable. Soon, an anonymous worker had already uploaded a video clip.The video was of a big white duck waddling forward, leading a fluffy little gosling down the hallway.At first, everyone had still been confused. They thought that this was some ordinary goose-herding being performed by the duck. Just as they were lamenting about how strange this company was \u2013 actually letting a duck raise a goose \u2013 an employee greeted the duck and goose. \u201cPeppa, going to the bathroom?\u201dThe duck didn\u2019t have much of a reaction, but the gosling flapped its wings. \u201cGe ge.\u201dThe netizens watching the video instantly felt astounded.\u3010What\u2019s going on? Peppa can understand?\u3011\u3010It must be a coincidence, right?\u3011As they discussed this, they saw the duck and gosling spin on their feet and walk through a doorway. The camera panned upward, revealing the sign for the women\u2019s bathroom.Netizens:\u3010\u2026\u2026? It\u2019s real???\u3011\u3010Peppa has gained a human consciousness?\u3011There were a few similar videos. Very quickly, everyone knew that Amazing Future\u2019s Peppa Goose truly had a high IQ. She absolutely wasn\u2019t as difficult to handle as normal avians.The programmers of other companies were instantly jealous. Of course, what made them feel more jealous was a different matter.\u3010Emmm, I don\u2019t know if the goose pictures are posed, but singer\u2019s hair is honestly very thick. Either working at this company isn\u2019t very stressful or they have extremely good fengshui conducive to growing hair. I don\u2019t care, I\u2019m going to submit my resume\u3011\u3010Plus one, upstairs. I want to go grow my hair out at Amazing Future too\u3011\u3010I think you guys got the order wrong. It\u2019s not \u201cgrow your hair out at Amazing Future,\u201d it\u2019s \u201cyou can only join Amazing Future after growing your hair out\u201d\u3011During lunch break on this day, Liu Wei and a group of programmers from their company started examining soccer bets after eating lunch. There had been several matches recently. The few of them often pooled their money and placed a few bets.Liu Wei: \u201cLet\u2019s buy this one. I feel like this one is more likely to win.\u201dThe other person: \u201cDon\u2019t. Their prowess is just so-so. They\u2019ve only won the past two matches because of luck.\u201dLiu Wei: \u201cLuck is also a type of prowess!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe in stuff like luck. We\u2019d better buy one for a team that has better combined prowess.\u201dThe two of them argued incessantly. A coworker nearby got annoyed, so suggested, \u201cQuit arguing. How about let\u2019s buy what Octopus ge says.\u201dOctopus ge was a viral celebrity who specialized in soccer match predictions. His Weibo ID was \u201cLittle Asian Octopus.\u201d Because he was riding off the popularity of the octopus who had once been undefeatable during the World Cup, and because his predictions were mostly acceptable, he was nicknamed \u201cOctopus ge\u201d by netizens.Liu Wei expressed his disagreement. \u201cI don\u2019t want to. Octopus ge is my idol\u2019s antifan. I refuse to listen to what he says.\u201dCoworker: \u201cThen we can only split our funds up and place separate bets.\u201dLiu Wei: \u201cDon\u2019t. Are we buying soccer bets? No, we\u2019re buying our amazing coworker relations.h.i.+p .\u201dCoworker: = = \u201cThen everyone hurry and come to the same decision.\u201dLiu Wei was slightly exasperated. He looked at the coworker who had argued with him. \u201cHow about playing rock, paper, scissors? We\u2019ll listen to whoever wins.\u201dThat person: \u201cSo tasteless.\u201dJust as they were stuck in the middle of their argument, a sound of \u201cgua gua\u201d suddenly sounded out from under them. Only to see a big white duck leading Peppa around on their post-lunch walk.\u201cOho, I have an idea,\u201d Liu Wei said. He hurriedly pulled out two pieces of paper and wrote the names of two different teams on them. Then, he placed them in front of Peppa and coaxed, \u201cPeppa, come. Help geges make a decision.\u201dUpon seeing this, everyone else chuckled too. \u201cYes yes yes. Let Peppa make the decision. We\u2019ll buy whichever one Peppa says to buy. n.o.body is allowed to have an opinion.\u201dPeppa had only just grown a little bit bigger. Because she had Shang Que\u2019s powers aiding her, she was much healthier than normal goslings. Her bright little eyes glanced from side to side before she stepped on one of the pieces of paper.Liu Wei was overjoyed. \u201cPeppa is very smart.\u201dThe other coworker was slightly disappointed. \u201cAiya, Peppa believes in luck too. Not many people have high hopes for this team.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the opposite of Octopus ge\u2019s prediction. Nevermind, nevermind. We\u2019ll just go with this one.\u201dFor several consecutive days, Yu Zhengdu had been eating lunch with Shang Que at the headquarters. On this day, because he had a bit of work to do, he stayed on the Amazing Future side. Naturally, Shang Que came over to eat with him.However, shortly after the two of them finished eating, they saw a group of programmers from their company chasing Peppa around with bright eyes and arms full of little toys and deluxe goose food.Liu Wei: \u201cPeppa, Peppa. Come. Help predict another match for us.\u201d\u201cPeppa jie , this is my offering for you today. Please accept it.\u201d\u201cGoose Immortal, you\u2019re our group\u2019s G.o.ddess!\u201dYu Zhengdu was completely lost. He called out to them and asked, \u201cWhat are you guys doing?\u201dOnly now did everyone discover that Yu Zhengdu and Boss were here today too. Liu Wei excitedly said, \u201cLeader, Peppa\u2019s so magical! She\u2019s already accurately predicted the results for four matches for us!\u201dThe other person: \u201cIn our soccer fan group chat, she has already usurped Octopus ge in status and officially become Peppa jie!\u201dYu Zhengdu: ????After asking for more details, he finally learned that a few days ago, Liu Wei and them had jokingly asked Peppa to predict the results of a match because they themselves had had conflicting opinions. Unexpectedly, the prediction had been accurate. At first, they only thought that this was a coincidence. Given the previous success, though, they once again jokingly asked her for a prediction.The two teams for the second match had a great difference of prowess. n.o.body had thought that Peppa would\u2019ve chosen the weaker soccer team. At the time, everyone had only been casually playing around. Thus, they hadn\u2019t placed their bets as per Peppa\u2019s prediction. Who would\u2019ve thought, though, that an unexpected winner had been produced that day: the much weaker team had won.These coworkers were shocked, but still believed in their hearts that this was only a coincidence. Later on, they once again asked Peppa for a prediction. Surprisingly, after four consecutive matches, Peppa actually managed to make four accurate predictions. Among these, two matches had even produced unexpected winners.Because of the fact that the three prior predictions had been accurate, by the fourth match, one coworker had boldly placed a lot of money into this bet and won a huge sum. He was the one who had been chasing Peppa around with little toys and deluxe feed just now.Not only so, but because Amazing Future\u2019s programmers had gotten into the bad habit of showing off their goose, they had eventually started posting pictures of Peppa\u2019s prediction process into their soccer fan group chats. Now, Peppa had quickly become the G.o.ddess of many soccer fans. At a young age, she was already being respectfully called \u201cPeppa jie\u201d by a group of grown men.After hearing the whole story, Yu Zhengdu was very speechless. \u201c\u2026\u2026Peppa jie?\u201dHe glanced at Peppa the gosling who was surrounded by a bunch of programmers. Peppa flapped her wings and looked back at him. She stuck her neck out and quacked, \u201cGa\u2014\u2014\u201dYu Zhengdu turned to look at Shang Que in confusion. \u201cThis is a coincidence, right?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Shang Que had remembered something too at this time. He fell silent for a moment before saying, \u201cYou still remember that Peppa was a spirit trapped in the belly in her past reincarnation, right?\u201dYu Zhengdu instantly understood.Previously, the reason a spell as evil as \u201ctrapping a spirit in the belly\u201d had become so widespread was because one of the belly spirit\u2019s skills was predicting the future. And in her past life, Peppa hadn\u2019t been an ordinary belly spirit; instead, she had been a belly spirit refined by the demon priest Jin Heguan. She possessed extremely strong powers of divination. The main goal that Liu Ningan had in keeping her around was to use her fortune telling skills to earn money.Shang Que explained that probably because Peppa had been refined in her past life, and had once possessed a living spirit, though this power had been greatly reduced after reincarnation, it hadn\u2019t completely disappeared. This was also a normal occurrence in reincarnation.Shang Que: \u201cIf you want her to accurately predict great catastrophes or extremely fortunate events like she did in the past, that wouldn\u2019t work. However, predicting the results of a soccer match likely won\u2019t be a problem.\u201dYu Zhengdu slowly became excited. \u201c\u2026\u2026Feels like we\u2019re about to get rich?\u201d\u201cSilly.\u201d Shang Que caressed his fluffy hair. \u201cDid you forget what happened to Liu Ningan?\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201cWow, don\u2019t scare me.\u201dThat group of programmers didn\u2019t hear their conversation. They had already prepared the pieces of paper with the names of the two teams for the upcoming match and were in the middle of calling Peppa over to make her prediction.Liu Wei: \u201cPeppa, if you make another accurate prediction this time, I\u2019ll buy you an extra luxurious goose mansion.\u201dShang Que glanced at the gosling. \u201cPeppa, come back.\u201dPeppa had originally already started walking in that direction. After being called to a halt by Shang Que, she immediately flapped her wings. While making \u201cga ga\u201d noises, she ran over to Shang Que. Shang Que bent down and picked her up, then placed her on top of Yu Zhengdu\u2019s shoulder. He warned, \u201cIn the future, you\u2019re not allowed to make these predictions anymore.\u201dPeppa nodded. \u201cGa ga.\u201dThe programmers started howling in misery. Liu Wei said with a bitter expression, \u201cBoss Shang, don\u2019t be so petty. We only place bets at lunch. It won\u2019t get in the way of work.\u201dYu Zhengdu already understood at this time. He said, \u201cWe\u2019re not doing this to stop you from placing bets. This is for your own good.\u201dEveryone expressed their confusion: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with placing bets?\u201d\u201cOnce or twice is fine, but too many times isn\u2019t,\u201d Yu Zhengdu explained. \u201cWhen you have too much wrongful luck for wealth, it\u2019ll affect your true luck for wealth.\u201dThis explanation was easy to understand and didn\u2019t need further interpretation. But Liu Wei was in slight disbelief. \u201cIt can\u2019t be that serious, right?\u201dShang Que glanced at the person who had spent a lot of money and earned a small fortune off soccer bets. \u201cYou earned a lot of money, right? If you don\u2019t get rid of all that money, you\u2019re going to become very unfortunate soon.\u201dThat person\u2019s expression instantly turned slightly foul. \u201cBoss, don\u2019t curse me .\u201dShang Que was too lazy to explain everything to him. He simply sat back down next to Yu Zhengdu.He wasn\u2019t letting Peppa continue to make predictions. Everyone else had no other options. They could only disperse. The employee who Shang Que had said was going to become unfortunate was still feeling indignant. He lowly complained to his other coworkers, \u201cBoss\u2019s speech is too, you know. Didn\u2019t I just use Peppa to earn some money? Does he need to curse me like that?\u201dHis coworker comforted, \u201cBoss has always spoken like this. You don\u2019t need to take it to heart.\u201dBut that person was still displeased. \u201cBeing straightforward doesn\u2019t mean you have to be mean. f.u.c.k. I\u2019m going to quit.\u201dHe thought about it and whispered, \u201cI\u2019m going to secretly tell you. Actually, I already received an offer from a P2P company two days ago. I originally thought that since our company\u2019s atmosphere is really nice, I would be a bit reluctant to leave. Thus, I was still in the middle of considering. But since Boss is like this, then I might as well just leave.\u201dHis coworker sweatdropped. \u201cThere\u2019s really no need. Boss Shang is a pretty nice person. And, he\u2019s never mistreated us. He just can\u2019t be bothered to be courteous.\u201dBut that person wasn\u2019t even listening. Somewhat pleased, he scoffed and said, \u201cDidn\u2019t he just say that I was going to become unfortunate? I\u2019m going to tell you the truth. The new company offered me a salary that\u2019s a 50% raise of what I\u2019m being paid now. Also, my hometown is recently about to get demolished , you know? My luck for wealth is great right now. It hasn\u2019t been affected at all.\u201dThe reason he dared to speak so bluntly about Shang Que was also because he felt confident due to these things.Because of the little interlude at lunch, the atmosphere around the Amazing Future programmers instantly became depressed. The employee who Shang Que had said would become unfortunate honestly couldn\u2019t handle his anger. He instantly submitted a letter of resignation.When Yu Zhengdu received the letter of resignation, he felt a bit surprised. Coincidentally, Shang Que was next to him. He shook his head. \u201cGo ahead and approve it.\u201dThus, Yu Zhengdu approved the letter of resignation. Because of this incident, the programmers all exploded. Everyone felt that there was no need for such a trivial incident to cause such great consequences. Their department had always been quite close. Otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t have pooled their money together to place soccer bets. As such, everyone tried to convince that coworker to stay.That person had originally hoped that the company would try to keep him. He hadn\u2019t thought that Yu Zhengdu would so carefreely approve his request. His shame transformed into anger. It became even more impossible for him to change his mind. Not only so, but he also purposefully sent screenshots of the offer from his new company to a few coworkers he was closer with. This was done as a slight attempt to intimidate the company.That person had submitted his letter of resignation, but he still needed to complete a handover of work. The next few days, he continued working at the company. Unexpectedly, as soon as he got to the company on this day, Liu Wei suddenly sent him a link:\u3010Is this the P2P company that gave you the offer? I think it\u2019s collapsed ?\u3011That person\u2019s eye twitched. He immediately clicked in to check. When he did so, he practically stopped breathing.These past few years, many P2P companies had collapsed one after the other. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t know this, but how could this have happened so coincidentally? He had just quit.Liu Wei:\u3010It really is? Oh s.h.i.+t. It can\u2019t really be like what Leader said, right?\u3011He forced himself to reply:\u3010So what if they\u2019ve collapsed. The salary wasn\u2019t much anyways. I\u2019m not missing that small amount of money.\u3011Liu Wei:\u3010Oh right. You\u2019re a demolition household\u3011Shortly after this conversation, that person\u2019s phone started ringing. He glanced at the number \u2013 it was a call from home. For some unknown reason, his heart skipped a beat. While trembling, he answered the call, only to hear his father say, \u201c\u2026\u2026A few people on our street who are refusing to relocate have caused a fuss. The demolition is probably going to be delayed for a long time\u2026\u2026\u201dThat person: \u201c\u2026\u2026Only our street?\u201dHow fast did information get spread on the Internet? That P2P company was also quite famous. As soon as it collapsed, everybody knew. In only an instant, Amazing Future\u2019s programmers had already started discussing this incident. They naturally couldn\u2019t avoid mentioning their coworker who had immediately quit after receiving an offer.\u201cf.u.c.k, it can\u2019t really be like what Leader said, right? His wrongful luck for wealth affected his true luck for wealth?\u201dA lot of people felt sorrowful, but many of them shared the same opinion as Liu Wei. They thought that since that coworker was going to be getting compensation for demolition, he wouldn\u2019t need that trivial salary anyways.Just as they were speaking, they saw the coworker they were discussing put down his phone and run over to Yu Zhengdu\u2019s workstation, expression on the brink of crying. This past period of time, Shang Que kept coming over to Amazing Future for some unknown reason. Right now, he had his laptop too and was working next to Yu Zhengdu. That person pleaded, \u201cLeader, Boss, I was wrong. Can you guys teach me? Teach me how to save my true luck for wealth?\u201dThe other programmers: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d<b>The author has something to say:</b>From Today On I Will Be A European G.o.d: It\u2019s Peppa\u2019s two dads today.Netizens: Two dads?????Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

From the bottom of my heart!\u201dAs soon as Zheng Yan walked into Amazing Future, he saw Peppa. She had grown up quite a bit and was wearing a little floral print dress. She was also flapping her wings and chasing down a programmer. That programmer was tall, over 1.8 meters . However, he still ended up being forced to take cover on a chair by Peppa. He held both hands up in the air as he surrendered and begged Peppa for mercy.Zheng Yan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAs expected from Luofeng\u2019s famous goose princess!Zheng Yan silently pulled out his phone and filmed this entire scene. Then, he uploaded it to the group chat for product managers in the Internet industry:\u3010Dear G.o.d, our company\u2019s Peppa Goose is bullying programmers again.\u3011The product managers in the group immediately responded.\u3010Dear G.o.d, Luofeng\u2019s employee is posting goose pictures again!\u3011\u3010More fresh Peppa to look at!!! I\u2019m in love!\u3011\u3010Goodness, CEO bought Peppa more dresses???\u3011\u3010Emmmmm??? Are your programmers for real??\u3011\u3010Speaking of, didn\u2019t someone mock homebodies in the past for having a combat effectiveness of only 0.5 geese? And here I thought that was an exaggerated estimation\u2026\u2026How come Amazing Future\u2019s programmers really can\u2019t win against a goose?\u3011\u3010And it\u2019s still a baby gosling\u2026\u2026\u3011From the beginning, geese had always been famed to have high combat effectiveness. In the past, some families in villages even kept geese to protect their yards. Geese were respectfully called 'society geese.\u201d As such, people online often used a single \u201cgoose\u201d as a unit of measurement for combat effectiveness. Additionally, they mocked weak, fat homebodies by saying they probably wouldn\u2019t even be able to win against a goose in a fight: they only had a combat effectiveness of \u201c0.5 geese\u201d\u2026\u2026 Of course, everyone had always thought that this was only a humorous description.Unexpectedly, Amazing Future\u2019s programmers were actually being chased around and bullied by a goose!\u3010I\u2019m lost. So do geese really have very high combat effectiveness or are programmers really that weak?\u3011\u3010Wake up, you guys. Is this a normal society goose? This is Luofeng\u2019s little princess!\u3011\u3010Hahahahahaha, karma for programmers! I don\u2019t care, I\u2019m going to make a post!\u3011Zheng Yan unintentionally ruined the reputation of all programmers. His mood instantly got much better.After all, product managers and programmers were sworn enemies!Zheng Yan finished reading everyone\u2019s criticisms of programmers before carrying his laptop over to find Yu Zhengdu. \u201cLeader, I need to ask you about something.\u201dYu Zhengdu turned around to look at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dZheng Yan set his laptop down on Yu Zhengdu\u2019s desk. His expression was very conflicted. Following a short pause, he finally said, \u201cLast night, someone from a publis.h.i.+ng firm contacted me saying that he wanted to buy our story\u2019s copyright\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cStory\u2019s copyright?\u201d Yu Zhengdu was bewildered. \u201cWhat story\u2019s copyright do we have?\u201d\u201cEmm\u2014\u2014\u201d Zheng Yan\u2019s eyes darted around. He felt guilty. \u201c\u2026\u2026A ghost story.\u201dYu Zhengdu felt even more confused. \u201cWhich ghost?\u201dZheng Yan silently turned his laptop screen over so that Yu Zhengdu would be able to see. \u201cA while ago, I uploaded some story updates from the Fengdu Forum onto a forum in the mortal realm. A publis.h.i.+ng firm became interested\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu: ??He glanced at the laptop screen. On it was the webpage of a famous gossip forum. Zheng Yan had opened up one of the popular posts on it.Heading: There Are No Hotels in the Netherworld\u2014\u2014Records of My Journey Through the UnderworldYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe naturally recognized this heading. Previously, after the Life Management app has been released, quite a lot of Underworld users had commented, saying that they hoped Luofeng could develop a socializing app to help the deceased reestablish their social networks after death. This had also already been on Luofeng\u2019s to-do list.After strict planning and development, a while ago, the Life Management app finally released a brand new updated version. This version now had the two functions of\u3010Ghost Friend Circle\u3011and\u3010Fengdu Forum\u3011.Among these,\u3010Ghost Friend Circle\u3011had the same functions as the mortal realm\u2019s WeChat. It could help Underworld spirits contact their friends from when they had still been alive. This way, they would be able to reestablish their social networks.Before this, due to the fact that each person pa.s.sed away and reincarnated at different times, people who had died often couldn\u2019t manage to get in contact with other people who had died at other times. Additionally, there was usually quite a long period of time where one awaited reincarnation. Because of this, sometimes, lonely ghosts would become dangerous and end up as threats to Underworld society.Since the release of this function, those Underworld spirits waiting for reincarnation would receive notifications as soon as one of their friends or relatives in the mortal realm pa.s.sed away. They could choose whether or not they wanted to contact that individual or add them to their friends list. This effectively helped everyone reunite in the Underworld.The emotional needs of Underworld spirits became satisfied. During this period of time, maintaining order in the Underworld had obviously become much easier. Luofeng\u2019s work rate had also evidently increased.The other function of the app,\u3010Fengdu Forum\u3011, was also quite similar to public social media in the mortal realm. It provided options for Underworld spirits to share information, ask for help, share experience, share opinions, etc.After this function became released, it received numerous positive reviews. All Underworld spirits were being ghosts for the first time, especially the new ghosts who had just pa.s.sed away. They were oftentimes very unused to their new ident.i.ties. The forum\u2019s \u201cask for help\u201d and 'share information\u201d options very effectively resolved this problem.Shortly after\u3010Fengdu Forum\u3011became released, enormous amounts of quality posts appeared. For example:Heading: How to Be a Ghost\u2014\u2014Accepting Burial Offerings, Things to Know About Reincarnation, Guide to Getting Hired in the Underworld, Intro to Underworld Activities, Etc.Heading: Intro to the New h.e.l.l\u2014\u2014The Collapse of Heaven and h.e.l.l, Why h.e.l.l\u2019s Offices Are Located in the Mortal Realm, Luofeng\u2019s Development, Underworld Society Regulations, Etc.Heading: Complete Skill Training for All New Ghosts: How to give people dreams, how to quickly and effectively remove your eyeb.a.l.l.s, how to pa.s.s through walls, how to avoid becoming an evil ghost, etc.Heading: Remaining Dead Till Old Age, Learning Till Old Age : Compilation of little tricks involved in being a ghost (continuously updating)There were also a lot of popular gossip posts:Heading: Motherf.u.c.king h.e.l.l, I Just Died, Only to Discover That the Ashes of Love Between My Husband Who Died Ten Years Before Me And His First Girlfriend Have Reignited (They\u2019re f.u.c.king Real Ashes )Heading: So Happy I\u2019m Crying! I Just Found Out My Ex-Boyfriend Who Always Hired Prost.i.tutes When He Was Alive is Going to Be a Chicken in His Next Life!!Heading: Help! My Grave Got Dug Up By Property Developers, is it Illegal For Me to Haunt the Developers\u2019 Homes?Heading: Examining the Strangely Self-Confident Drowned Ghost Who Lives Next to My Cinerary UrnHeading: If I Say This Out Loud, You All Might Not Believe Me, But I\u2019m a Ghost With a CatAnd there were posts from famous ghosts:Heading: Becoming A Refined Female Ghost; Even in Death, We Still Have to Have Beautiful Makeup (Author is a Painted Skin Ghost)Heading: Reviews of Various Toilets in Fu City (Author is a Guilong)Heading: I Really Don\u2019t Know How to Make Thunder, the Wind and Rain Are a Package Deal (Author is a Dao Lao Ghost )The post that Zheng Yan had reposted to a mortal forum,\u300aThere Are No Hotels in the Netherworld\u300b, had been written by a ghost who loved travelling. While alive, this ghost had been a travel blogger. After his death, he had kept his hobby from life and updated his travel journal on the forum while travelling.This post recorded several locations that only ghosts could visit. For example, desolate cemeteries, the black underground river, the paper bridge of the Underworld, etc. He also shared the varying funeral customs, burial goods, and Underworld transportation methods of different places.However, the most interesting part for readers was reading about the author\u2019s experiences interacting with different ghosts in different places. Not only did the author expertly describe the ways of life for ghosts who had died in different ways, he also gave in-depth backstories for each of these ghosts. This included but wasn\u2019t limited to hangman ghosts who had died for love, completely formless car accident ghosts, murder victim ghosts who only desired revenge, etc.Due to the fact that many people only realized what those around them were truly like after their deaths, and because they would often discover many truths that they hadn\u2019t known when alive, these ghosts\u2019 stories were often more absurd and memorable. They captivated readers greatly.This post was extremely popular on the Fengdu Forum. Quite a lot of Underworld spirits awaited its updates every day. It was practically considered a written doc.u.mentary of the Underworld.Yu Zhengdu had also spent a period of time waiting for these updates. However, because he had gotten too busy with work later on, he had given up. He hadn\u2019t thought that Zheng Yan would upload these posts to a forum in the mortal realm.\u201cThis post is too horrifying\u2026\u2026\u201d Zheng Yan was on the brink of sobbing. \u201cI just thought \u2018I can\u2019t die from fright alone,\u2019 which is why I uploaded it onto this gossip forum. I wanted to scare some other people\u2026\u2026\u201dHe added on in emphasis, \u201cI deleted any content that could\u2019ve exposed the secrets of the Underworld. This is the harmless, clean version.\u201dYu Zhengdu was practically speechless: \u201c\u2026\u2026You clearly could\u2019ve chosen not to read it.\u201dZheng Yan: \u201cBut it\u2019s really very good. Did you know? The author posted a story about a ghost who jumped out of a building last week. Wow, it turns out that the heads of those ghosts really do tend to stick to the ground. Honestly so f.u.c.king scary\u2026\u2026\u201dAs if to prove that he was telling the truth, Zheng Yan scrolled down the post that he had made on the mortal forum and stopped at the latest update. He insistently recommended to Yu Zhengdu, \u201cLook. Super exhilarating.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHeading: There Are No Hotels in the Netherworld\u2014\u2014Records of My Journey Through the UnderworldFloor 88896: \u2026\u2026The jumper ghost was very welcoming and friendly. He personally led me on a tour of the local attractions. The only downside was that he oftentimes couldn\u2019t prevent himself from using his head to walk. This always produced numerous s. This looked a bit terrifying\u2014\u2014Fortunately, I\u2019m not a human, so wasn\u2019t too scared.During our tour, the jumper ghost relayed to me a small mistake he had made during his time as a ghost. That night, he had attended the mourning reception of one of his recently deceased friends. He got extremely drunk and, while bleary, didn\u2019t return to his own grave. Instead, he returned to the place he had lived when still alive.When alive, the jumper ghost had been scammed by a friend until he had gone broke. In a fit of complete hopelessness, he jumped off of his building. Perhaps because of some sort of fate, the night he returned to his old home, he coincidentally encountered his scammer friend; the other was back to find the jumper ghost\u2019s financial doc.u.ments.After death, the matters of the mortal realm all become irrelevant. The jumper ghost originally didn\u2019t want to interact with that person. Unexpectedly, though, when he had left his friend\u2019s mourning reception, he had accidentally stepped on a yellow talisman\u2014\u2014 As everyone knows, stepping on a yellow talisman creates the possibility for a ghost to manifest in the mortal realm.That night, the jumper ghost had drunk alcohol. While of unclear mind, he slightly manifested. His friend had already felt guilty, thus naturally became absolutely terrified. In a panic, he hid under the table, figuring that ghosts didn\u2019t know how to bend over (I don\u2019t know where this rumor originated from either. When I have the time, I will look into it). As such, he believed that the jumper ghost wouldn\u2019t be able to see him.The jumper ghost didn\u2019t actually want to see him either. Only, he was completely drunk. As he lost control, his head landed on the ground again, rendering him in the same posture that he had been in after jumping out of the building\u2014\u2014Unfortunately, he came face to face with the friend hiding under the table. His face was covered in blood, which terrified his friend so much that he had a heart attack. Then, he ended up staying in the hospital for more than half a year.Floor 88897: f.u.c.k, I just imagined that scene in my head. I burst into tears from fear.Floor 88898: Building owner please continue. Also, is there a follow-up for the story about the car accident ghost from last time?Floor 88899: s.h.i.+t, I\u2019ll never dare to hide under tables again.Floor 88900: Building owner is really creative. Where did you get all these unique ideas from?!Floor: 88901: I adore building owner\u2019s style of writing about bulls.h.i.+t in a serious manner.Floor 88902: This must be the supposed \u201cif you don\u2019t do bad things normally, you won\u2019t fear ghosts knocking on your door in the middle of the night.\u201dYu Zhengdu glanced at the page count for the post while reading it. He immediately became shocked. \u201c\u2026\u2026It\u2019s so popular?\u201dThis post had actually almost reached a hundred thousand replies.Zheng Yan held his hands out. \u201cNetizens have much better tolerance than I thought.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026Mainly because your tolerance is too poor, right?\u201dZheng Yan pretended that he hadn\u2019t heard anything. He replied, \u201cI hadn\u2019t expected that the netizens would like this post so much either. I think a lot of other forums have reposted it too\u2026\u2026\u201dSpeaking of this, he really felt like sighing. Initially, he had honestly only wanted to scare the netizens. Unexpectedly, netizens had such great curiosity. The post got more and more popular. Everyday, people incessantly begged him to continue updating.The publis.h.i.+ng firm who had asked them for a collaboration this time wasn\u2019t the first one to do so. However, it was the one that had offered the sincerest price. Zheng Yan also knew that these days, all the Underworld ghosts were trying to generate income. If this story could really become published, perhaps it could give the true travel blogger some money. Because of this, after careful consideration, he ultimately decided to discuss this matter with Yu Zhengdu.Yu Zhengdu\u2019s opinion was largely the same as Zheng Yan\u2019s. However, he needed to consider a few more things than Zheng Yan needed to\u2014\u2014If stories from the Underworld could be published in the mortal realm, they wouldn\u2019t only earn copyright fees. They could also bear some of the responsibility for maintaining balance between the mortal realm and Underworld. As long as the content that could possibly expose the secret of the Underworld got deleted, the other parts could actually serve as a warning for the mortal realm.Since historical times, ghost stories had all used ghosts to satirize humans. As of now, this was still applicable.Yu Zhengdu very quickly discussed and confirmed with Shang Que. Thereafter, Luofeng\u2019s employees got in contact with the original author. After explaining the events that had occurred, the original author was also very happy that his journey records were so well welcomed in the mortal realm too. Soon after, he agreed to sell the copyright. Of course, due to an obvious reason, the mortal realm\u2019s copyright could only be a.s.signed to Luofeng. Luofeng would then pay the original author through agency shares.Posts from the Underworld would soon be published in the mortal realm. As soon as the news about the author successfully earning money from the mortal realm became spread, this fueled an unprecedented pa.s.sion for creation among the Underworld spirits. After, there were also a lot of other compositions regarding different topics that managed to become edited and published. And, after these ghosts headed off to reincarnation, the copyright license officially became solely owned by Luofeng. But we won\u2019t go into further detail about that.During this period of time, Zhao Ruola submitted a request to the company for a rather long period of time off. She wanted to go back and accompany her mother during her final moments.Zhao Ruola\u2019s father had already pa.s.sed away a few years ago. Her mother\u2019s health wasn\u2019t so great. She had chosen to return to her country while in the middle of a successful career partially because she wanted to accompany her mother.Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que both knew about this. As such, Shang Que very quickly approved her request. Additionally, he told her that if she needed to, she could unconditionally extend her vacation. Yu Zhengdu would temporarily take over her work responsibilities.However, before Yu Zhengdu could take care of these responsibilities for too long, he received a message from Jiao Shanlan saying that Zhao Ruola\u2019s mother was in a very bad state. The hospital had already notified her that her mother was likely going to die within the next few days.When Yu Zhengdu received this news, he was in a very sorrowful mood. In the end, after getting Zhao Ruola\u2019s permission, he and Shang Que headed to the hospital to visit Zhao Ruola and her mother.As expected, Zhao Ruola\u2019s mother was already very frail. There were tubes in her nose. She was fast asleep.Zhao Ruola stayed next to her bed, expression ghastly pale.\u201cErica, life and death are fated. Don\u2019t worry too much,\u201d Yu Zhengdu comforted.Zhao Ruola sighed gently. \u201cAfter working at Luofeng for so long, I obviously know that. You guys don\u2019t need to worry about me.\u201dShe was saying this, but two uncontrollable teardrops still leaked out from the corners of her eyes. She covered her face with her hands and her voice started choking up too. \u201cOnly, only\u2026\u2026\u201dZhao Ruola had always been strong, even more so in the workplace. This was her first time revealing her weaknesses to others.Yu Zhengdu patted her on the shoulder.\u201c I understand.\u201dHe said in a somewhat self-deprecating manner, \u201cThough we work for h.e.l.l, we can still only watch as our relatives pa.s.s away. Death is probably the fairest thing in this world.\u201d\u201cActually, when my mother was critically ill, I once had the urge to check the Life and Death Accounts\u2026\u2026\u201d Zhao Ruola suddenly admitted.Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que looked at her. In understanding, Yu Zhengdu said, \u201cBut you didn\u2019t.\u201dZhao Ruola\u2019s smile was very reluctant. \u201cI\u2019m a technician. This is a part of our basic work ethic.\u201dLife and death were the fairest things in this world. Luofeng\u2019s technology was designed to maintain this fairness. The living couldn\u2019t peak at the fates of themselves or others. Even though she was facing her own mother, Zhao Ruola still chose to stand by her own ethics.Yu Zhengdu lamented to himself in his heart. Only someone as principled as Zhao Ruola could become Luofeng\u2019s technical director.Of course, it was also fortunate that she had stood by her principles and not checked. It was technologically possible to look at fate, but the actual process would bring grave danger to the person doing it.Shang Que stood off to the side, expressionless. He didn\u2019t view life and death in the same way humans did. He was always rather nonchalant about these matters. Upon hearing this, he suddenly said, \u201cThe living always place too much importance on life.\u201dZhao Ruola looked up at him.Yu Zhengdu softly coughed and glared at Shang Que. Shang Que continued, \u201cBut that\u2019s not bad at all. Human emotions are very strange. Perhaps that is the reason they feel that life is too short.\u201dAs they were speaking, Zhao Ruola\u2019s mother woke up. In a daze, she reached her hand toward the edge of the bed. \u201cRuoruo\u2026\u2026Ruoruo\u2026\u2026\u201dHer voice was very faint, like she was on her last breath.Zhao Ruola immediately grabbed onto her hand and listened to her stumble out some last minute reminders.\u201cIs this your boss and coworker?\u201d Mother Zhao\u2019s turbid eyes focused on Shang Que and Yu Zhengdu with great difficulty. \u201cI\u2019ll have to ask you guys\u2026\u2026I\u2019ll have to ask you guys to help take care of Ruola\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s always been independent\u2026\u2026She never lets me worry\u2026\u2026B-but, how could I not worry\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu nodded solemnly. \u201cAuntie, don\u2019t worry.\u201dZhao Ruola revealed a sad smile. \u201cMom, I\u2019ll take good care of myself.\u201d\u201cYou \u2026\u2026\u201d Mother Zhao did her best to reach up and caress the other\u2019s face. In the end, she couldn\u2019t muster up the strength to do so. \u201cMom is leaving now. Don\u2019t be sad.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t be sad.\u201d Tears streamed down Zhao Ruola\u2019s face. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cEy\u2026\u2026\u201d Mother Zhao heaved out a long sigh and slowly closed her eyes.Very quickly, the doctors and nurses rushed in. The doctor checked Mother Zhao\u2019s conditions and told Zhao Ruola, \u201cMiss Zhao, my condolences.\u201dZhao Ruola nodded, then buried her face in her hands.Yu Zhengdu felt a bit uncomfortable in his heart too. He wanted to go comfort her, but also didn\u2019t know what to say.He glanced at Shang Que, bewildered. Shang Que held onto his hand and gently patted the back of it.Just as they were grieving, a cheery voice suddenly sounded out in the sick room. \u201cAiya, old man, it\u2019s really you?\u201dIt was Mother Zhao\u2019s voice.Yu Zhengdu was shocked. He looked up, only to see Zhao Ruola abruptly lift her head too.The sick bed was surrounded by busy hospital workers. Mother Zhao\u2019s body was peacefully laying on the bed. She had already stopped breathing.Meanwhile, in the sick room, an old lady\u2019s spirit was holding a phone and happily making a phone call. \u201cSo technology in the Underworld has already become so advanced?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the ghost friend circle?\u2026\u2026Just a normal friend circle? Then I\u2019ll immediately download it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026There are even death notifications? Doesn\u2019t that mean that the news that I\u2019ve pa.s.sed away has already been received by my old friends?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great! It\u2019s been several years since I\u2019ve gone public square dancing. Now we can schedule a group event.\u201d\u201cEy, I just died. There\u2019s still so much I don\u2019t understand\u2026\u2026Okay, then hurry and come pick me up. I\u2019m at the People\u2019s Hospital. I\u2019ll go wait for you at the hospital entrance.\u201dZhao Ruola watched, stunned, as her mother\u2019s spirit happily chatted on the phone. She opened her mouth, but ultimately couldn\u2019t say anything.A while later, Mother Zhao finally recalled something. She turned around and looked at Zhao Ruola.Zhao Ruola hurriedly buried her face in her palms again, pretending like she hadn\u2019t noticed anything at all.\u201cOld man, our daughter is here as well. Do you want to come see her too?\u201d Mother Zhao asked. The answer from the other side couldn\u2019t be heard. She slowly lowered her phone and revealed a relieved smile. \u201cRuoruo , you need to live well.\u201dAfter saying this, she carried her phone and walked out of the sick room.Even from a distance, the sounds of her calling her old friends could be heard. \u201cYes yes yes, I just died. Let\u2019s go dancing together?\u201d\u201cOld Zhang already reincarnated? What a pity. We didn\u2019t get to see each other one last time\u2026\u2026\u201dMother Zhao\u2019s voice slowly drifted away, leaving the two stunned Luofeng employees in the sick room.Shang Que nodded. \u201cI forgot that you guys can see ghosts.\u201dZhao Ruola: = =Yu Zhengdu: = =\u201cSorry, I\u2019m here late.\u201d Jiao Shanlan ran in panting. He glanced at the sick bed and solemnly comforted Zhao Ruola, \u201cErica, the dead cannot come back to life. Don\u2019t be too sad.\u201dZhao Ruola slowly sighed. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m not sad at all\u2026\u2026\u201dJiao Shanlan: ???<b>The author has something to say:</b>lan: I honestly hadn\u2019t expected that Erica would be so cold-hearted!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Users have great antic.i.p.ation for this game co-produced by Double Horn Technology and Luofeng. If nothing unexpected happens, we\u2019ll continue as planned and officially release the game before the Lunar New Year,\u201d Wei Xiao said.As the big boss of Double Horn Technology, Wei Xiao had personally visited Luofeng in the past and bought the right to use the Luofeng Ghost Festival Garden Party\u2019s IP. Then, he had adapted and developed it into a game. Currently, the game had finally been completely developed and was named\u300aDream Tour of Fengdu\u300b.Because it was close to the Lunar New Year, Wei Xiao had specially made the time to visit prior to the holidays in order to buy some luck changing jade stones for his daughter. Additionally, he was buying some Underworld energy detectors as holiday gifts for his friends and relatives. Since he was already here, he once again confirmed the state of affairs regarding the\u300aDream Tour of Fengdu\u300bproject with Shang Que.After hearing this, a strange, uncontrollable smile appeared on Shang Que\u2019s face. \u201cIt\u2019s finally going to be released\u2026\u2026\u201dThough Luofeng had only authorized the use of the IP without getting involved with the game development, as the IP owner, Shang Que had given the game developer quite a lot of suggestions. As soon as Wei Xiao saw this familiar smile, he instantly felt a chill run down his spine. He hurriedly reminded, \u201cBoss Shang, regarding your game designs, please absolutely keep them confidential. Otherwise, if they get exposed, we will have a really hard time explaining to other users\u2026\u2026\u201dShang Que waved his hands nonchalantly. \u201cGot it.\u201dAfter discussing official business, Wei Xiao was just about to leave when Shang Que suddenly changed the topic. \u201cOh right. I have something to ask you about.\u201dWei Xiao sat up straighter upon noticing his solemn expression. \u201cPlease ask, Boss Shang.\u201dShang Que slightly leaned forward. He seriously asked, \u201cHas your daughter signed up for any online lessons before? Are there any exceptionally good ones you want to recommend?\u201dWei Xiao c.o.c.ked an eyebrow. \u201cBoss Shang, are you signing your own kid up? Or asking for a friend?\u201dShang Que looked pleased. \u201cFor my own kid, of course.\u201dWei Xiao felt slightly surprised. \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell. Boss Shang is so young, but already has a child?\u201dShang Que coughed softly. He said in a rare bout of modesty, \u201cI\u2019m actually not that young anymore.\u201d\u201cBut Boss Shang is quite young to have a child who\u2019s already capable of taking lessons, right?\u201d Wei Xiao asked with a smile. \u201cHowever, you\u2019ve asked the right person. In the past, because of her health conditions, Momo couldn\u2019t attend preschool or other extracurricular cla.s.ses. My wife and I specially looked into several different online cla.s.ses\u2026\u2026\u201dAs expected, as Wei Xiao spoke, he recommended a lot of online tutoring cla.s.ses for young children to Shang Que. He also listed detailed pros and cons for these different cla.s.ses. At the end, he added, \u201cOnline cla.s.ses require parents to have enough time to accompany their child, though. Boss Shang is so busy; unless there are some really particular reasons, it\u2019s still better to have your child attend preschool and in-person extracurriculars.\u201dShang Que: \u201cThere is a particular reason.\u201d\u201cOh? What reason?\u201d Wei Xiao asked. \u201cIf Boss Shang doesn\u2019t mind, you can tell me. I\u2019m technically somewhat experienced in raising a kid. Perhaps I can give Boss Shang some suggestions?\u201dShang Que crossed his arms across his chest. \u201cIn-person cla.s.ses won\u2019t accept her.\u201dWei Xiao felt even more confused. \u201c\u2026\u2026Why? Is there something wrong with the child?\u201dShang Que: \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201dWei Xiao was bewildered. But since Shang Que didn\u2019t want to say, he couldn\u2019t keep badgering the other.After discussions, Wei Xiao stood up to officially bid farewell. As soon as he pushed open the door to the office, though, he got frightened by a loud and proud string of \u201cga ga ga ga\u2014\u2014\u201d sounds. Immediately after, he saw a programmer being chased around by a big white goose.The goose looked to be about half a meter tall. It was very round and was even wearing a little pink dress. It looked exceptionally cute.However, it was obvious that this goose\u2019s temper wasn\u2019t as cute as her appearance. She was in the middle of viciously chasing a programmer. Her big wings flapped like wind fire wheels . The roar of the wind could practically be heard. Her long goose neck accurately darted forward as she pecked and latched onto the back of that programmer\u2019s ankle.That programmer was tall and big, but somehow managed to start tearing up because of a goose\u2019s bite. He sobbed while begging, \u201cPeppa jie, I was wrong. You\u2019re not fat at all, really. You\u2019re the goose with the best figure in the world\u2014\u2014\u201dGeese grew up very quickly. In only a short period of time, Peppa had already grown into a big goose. As her body gradually got bigger and stronger, Shang Que no longer limited her from going to certain places. As of now, she often travelled between the headquarters and subsidiary company.These past two days, Yu Zhengdu had been on the Luofeng side. Thus, she always stayed behind at headquarters too. Unexpectedly, she encountered a programmer from the subsidiary company heading over to headquarters to report on work. As soon as he saw her, the first thing he said was, \u201cPeppa, it\u2019s been two days since I\u2019ve seen you. How come you got fatter again?\u201dAnd then this programmer learned what the \u201cfury of a goose\u201d was.This scene also just so happened to get witnessed by Wei Xiao.Wei Xiao: \u201c\u2026\u2026??\u201dHe had also heard about the fact that Luofeng had a goose named Peppa who liked wearing little dresses, but\u2026\u2026was it really okay for a programmer to be bullied like this by a goose?The legends about programmers having lower combat effectiveness than geese were true?Wei Xiao, who had started off as a product manager, couldn\u2019t help pulling out his phone and taking a picture of Peppa bullying the programmer. He also posted this to his Moments:\u3010Wei Xiao: Let\u2019s have a rational discussion. Do programmers truly only have a combat effectiveness of 0.5 geese or no? [Picture]\u3011In the picture, a programmer was pitifully squatting on the ground. His hands were glued together in a begging position. And across from him, a goose wearing a dress had already retracted her wings. She proudly lifted her long goose neck and puffed out her white, round goose chest. Her wings were slightly spread out. It was unsure if this was an illusion, but it actually kind of looked like she was resting them on her hips.Wei Xiao had a lot of friends on WeChat. Additionally, many of them were big bosses in the industry. As soon as he posted this, he instantly received numerous likes. This post even got screenshotted by someone and uploaded online. It garnered a bunch of comments from netizens saying:\u3010 2333333 \u3011\u3010Though Wei Xiao hasn\u2019t been a product manager for many years, it seems that he still hasn\u2019t changed his instinct to harm programmers\u3011\u3010Shocked. Previously, I heard people say that Amazing Future\u2019s programmers often get bullied by Peppa. And here I thought that those stories were made up. But actually?!!!\u3011\u3010Programmers\u2019 reputations have been ruined\u2026\u2026\u3011Because of Wei Xiao\u2019s one post on Moments, a happy argument regarding the combat effectiveness of programmers vs geese broke out online. Someone even specially made a diagram examining reasons why programmers couldn\u2019t defeat geese from various perspectives.However, very soon after this diagram was created, it got disproved by a powerful truth.From Today On I Will Be A European G.o.d: Peppa wasn\u2019t obedient today. Dad is angry [Picture]In the picture, Peppa had her wings pressed close to her body and was lowering her head. Even her little goose feet were turned inwards. She looked both obedient and pitiful. Meanwhile, across from her stood Yu Zhengdu with his arms crossed over his chest. His expression was serious; it looked like he was in the middle of scolding her.Netizens:k3010;k2026;k2026;Senior seems to be a programmer too? He\u2019s defeated the goose!k3011;k3010;Thank you Senior for rectifying the reputation of all programmers!!!k3011;k3010;Wow, Senior is winning at life. As a programmer, not only does he have a thick head of hair, but he can also perfectly control a goose. I\u2019m so, so jealous!k3011;\u3010Seems like CEO has yet to post a picture of the goose without Senior included in it?\u3011Because of Yu Zhengdu\u2019s existence, programmers finally turned the tides of the fight between programmers and geese, successfully saving their reputations.Right now, Wei Xiao \u2013 who had just finished posting to his Moments \u2013 was just about to leave Luofeng. Only to see Yu Zhengdu walk out from a different conference room while carrying a laptop. Coincidentally, he noticed Peppa with her wings out and bullying a programmer. He instantly furrowed his brows and yelled, \u201cPeppa?\u201dPeppa hurriedly glued her wings back to her sides and then took big steps forward with her webbed feet. She quickly ran towards Yu Zhengdu. \u201cGa ga\u2014\u2014\u201dWei Xiao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dJust as he was feeling shocked, Shang Que walked out from behind him too. He glanced at the goose and revealed the expression of a strict father. \u201cPeppa, I just reached an agreement with your dad. After the new year, we\u2019re going to sign you up for an online cla.s.s. Study well. Don\u2019t go around bullying those pitiful programmers everyday anymore.\u201dPeppa flapped her wings: \u201cGa ga\u2014\u2014\u201dWei Xiao: \u201c\u2026\u2026??\u201dThe corners of Wei Xiao\u2019s mouth twitched. He couldn\u2019t go ask Shang Que in a straightforward manner, though. He felt like this would seem like he was questioning the other\u2019s intelligence (?). He shook his head and ultimately didn\u2019t inquire further. Instead, he headed out of Luofeng alone.After exiting the office, Wei Xiao turned to go to the bathroom. Surprisingly, when he came out of the bathroom, he encountered Peppa again.Peppa was heading out of the women\u2019s bathroom across the hallway. Wei Xiao remembered the online rumors about how Luofeng\u2019s duck and goose knew how to use the bathroom themselves. Thus, he chuckled and said, \u201cYo, Peppa. Going to the bathroom?\u201dHe had originally been offhandedly joking. Unexpectedly, the goose\u2019s bright little eyes looked around. Then, she nodded and quacked.Wei Xiao was shocked. He looked at her in disbelief. \u201cYou can understand?\u201dThe goose\u2019s beady eyes turned to look elsewhere. This time, she didn\u2019t reply to him, though.Wei Xiao was shocked in his heart. He also couldn\u2019t determine if this goose had understood or not. He thought about it, then pulled out his phone and typed \u201cPeppa Goose\u201d into the Weibo search bar. Instantly, several lovely pictures of Peppa at varying ages popped up. There were also legends about how cute and obedient she was.However, people online only said that Peppa was a bit smarter than normal avians and that she was a good pet to keep. There wasn\u2019t anything overly exaggerated.Wei Xiao calmed down a bit. It was true that geese were smarter than normal birds. Otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t have been kept by certain families to guard the house. If Luofeng\u2019s goose was smarter than a normal goose, it would be normal for it to understand simple words and commands.Probably because the fact that Shang Que was signing a goose up for online cla.s.ses had traumatized him, he had actually misbelieved that this goose could understand human language.\u2026\u2026But no matter what, even if this goose was smarter than a normal goose, he still had to say that Shang Que signing a goose up for cla.s.ses was too crazy!Wei Xiao felt like he was really going insane. He burst into laughter and shook his head, then squatted down to stroke Peppa\u2019s little head. With a grin, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re so cute.\u201dPeppa spread her wings. \u201cGa\u2014\u2014\u201dWei Xiao was just about to stand up when he suddenly scrolled onto a post on Weibo: Peppa jie once again successfully predicted the results of the game! [Picture]The attached photo was a screenshot of a group chat. It seemed to be saying that Peppa was akin to Octopus ge from many years ago. She had successfully predicted the results of several compet.i.tions.This Weibo was from a while back. There also weren\u2019t any other posts on the Internet alluding to the fact that Peppa could predict the outcomes of matches. She had probably just coincidentally chosen the right answer out of two choices, just like Octopus ge had in the past.Wei Xiao naturally didn\u2019t believe this Weibo post. However, he coincidentally happened to be stuck between two choices right now. Upon seeing this post, he jokingly asked, \u201cPeppa, say, do you think I should take my family to Si Mountain Ridge over break, or should we go back to my ancestral home and wors.h.i.+p the ancestors?\u201dWei Xiao was normally very busy with work; he didn\u2019t have much free time to spend with his family. The few days of vacation during the new year were very precious. In the past, because of his daughter Wei Mo\u2019s health conditions, they had usually stayed at home. With the help of Luofeng\u2019s products this year, though, Wei Mo could finally be like a normal child and leave the house at will. Thus, Wei Xiao wanted to bring his family to Si Mountain Ridge for vacation. However, the kid\u2019s paternal grandmother felt like since the child had finally managed to become more normal, they needed to return to their ancestral home and wors.h.i.+p the ancestors.In his heart, Wei Xiao actually wanted to bring his kid out to have fun, but he also found it hard to reject his mom. He had been quite troubled these past two days.He had only offhandedly asked this question. He hadn\u2019t been expecting for a goose to actually respond to him at all. However, he saw Peppa\u2019s bright little eyes blink at him. She suddenly flapped her wings and went \u201cga\u2014\u2014\u201d.Wei Xiao\u2019s heart skipped a beat. He didn\u2019t know if this was an illusion, but he felt like he could see understanding in Peppa\u2019s eyes. He was extremely confused, so hesitantly inquired, \u201cPeppa, are you replying to me?\u201dPeppa only stared at him with her round eyes. She didn\u2019t say anything.Wei Xiao thought about it and reworded his question. \u201cWhat do you think about me taking my family to Si Mountain Ridge?\u201dThe round, white goose head shook from side to side.Wei Xiao jumped in fright. He asked again, \u201cThen what about my ancestral home?\u201dPeppa nodded.This time, Wei Xiao was truly astounded. His gaze was disbelieving as he looked at Peppa. \u201cYou can really understand?\u201dHowever, Peppa didn\u2019t respond this time. She flapped her wings and waddled away.Wei Xiao felt anxious. He momentarily didn\u2019t know whether or not he should trust this goose. However, he wasn\u2019t not superst.i.tious. After also remembering all the strange products Luofeng had, he hesitated a bit before sending a message to his family members:\u3010Let\u2019s go back to our ancestral home this New Year. Given the opportunity, we can go on vacation later.\u3011In the blink of an eye, it had already reached the Lunar New Year. Luofeng\u2019s headquarters and subsidiary company, Amazing Future, had the same work and holiday schedule as all other mortal realm companies. They naturally gave vacation time during the Lunar New Year as well. However, babies were still being born during the new year too. The reincarnation points couldn\u2019t be closed. Workers could only take turns going on breaks.This year, Luofeng had been on a steady incline in terms of work performance. It couldn\u2019t be compared in the slightest to the previous years, when the office had been almost broke. The company gave everyone end-of-the-year bonuses. The employees working over the new year all got paid three times their normal salary, except when they were on break. Luofeng had also arranged for some celebratory activities and an employee meal at each reincarnation point. Given such thoughtful arrangements, all the employees were extremely happy.On Lunar New Year\u2019s Eve, Yu Zhengdu brought along his boyfriend, a goose, and a duck as he started his journey back to his hometown of Jintan Village.Shang Que had already celebrated Qingming at Yu Zhengdu\u2019s hometown before. He had even gifted Yu Zhengdu\u2019s family an antique teacup set. Yu Zhengdu\u2019s parents had also learned that Shang Que didn\u2019t have any family. As such, the two elders didn\u2019t even say anything when they learned that Shang Que would be coming again. They were very welcoming. Over the phone, Mother Yu had specially expressed her extreme excitement to Yu Zhengdu over the fact that Shang Que would be coming.Yu Zhengdu: \u2026\u2026His mom had purely been mesmerized by Shang Que\u2019s devastating beauty.This year, Father Yu had prepared the New Year\u2019s dinner. Mother Yu was fiddling with the New Year\u2019s decorations \u2013 fresh flowers and bonsai \u2013 on the patio.When they heard Yu Zhengdu yelling at the door, Father Yu walked out from the kitchen to open the door. He was still wearing an ap.r.o.n. While opening the door, he yelled out to his wife, \u201cZhengdu and your greatly antic.i.p.ated Xiao Shang are back.\u201dYu Zhengdu, who was outside the door: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu and Shang Que were wearing matching scarves. Shang Que was also carrying many bags of different sizes. When they saw Father Yu walking out, Yu Zhengdu called out to him first.And then Shang Que nodded at Father Yu somewhat awkwardly. \u201ch.e.l.lo.\u201dYu Zhengdu secretly chuckled to himself from off to the side. The thousand year old ghost ultimately couldn\u2019t call someone else \u201cuncle\u201d.Father Yu wasn\u2019t paying attention either. When he noticed that their hands were full, he immediately reached out to help them. \u201cYou just need to come back. Why did you bring so much stuff?\u201dHowever, before he could make physical contact, a sudden loud \u201cga\u2014\u2014\u201d sounded out. A duck and a goose scurried out from behind Shang Que and Yu Zhengdu, scaring Father Yu greatly.Father Yu widened his eyes. \u201cHow come you also brought a duck and a goose?\u201dImmediately after, he rolled up his sleeves. \u201cJust as well. Then I\u2019ll show you one of my best dishes\u2014\u2014the two-in-one braised dish.\u201dThe wet nurse duck couldn\u2019t really understand human speech, but Peppa could. Upon hearing this, she spread her wings, turned her little b.u.t.t around, and frantically ran away.\u201cAiya, the goose is running away!\u201d Father Yu was very agitated. He started chasing.Yu Zhengdu hurriedly stopped him. \u201cDad, this is Xiao Shang\u2019s pet. She\u2019s basically his biological daughter! You absolutely cannot kill her and eat her!\u201dFather Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201dHe did know that the wealthy did lots of strange things and also liked keeping strange pets. But raising a goose\u2026\u2026and as a daughter? This was his first time encountering such a situation.He was muttering to himself in his heart, but still needed to act like everything was normal. Father Yu smiled in embarra.s.sment, \u201cI was joking. Just joking.\u201dOnly now did Yu Zhengdu gesture at Peppa. \u201cPeppa, come back. He won\u2019t eat you.\u201dPeppa\u2019s round little eyes flashed. She carefully walked back. Upon seeing this, Father Yu exclaimed, \u201cYo, she can even understand human speech?\u201dShang Que nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s very smart.\u201dYu Zhengdu also said to Father Yu, \u201cSo it\u2019d be best for there to be no poultry on our table this year. Not even chicken.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201d Father Yu lowered his voice, \u201cI\u2019ll go put the scallion oil chicken back into the fridge later. We\u2019ll eat it when you guys leave.\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026If you\u2019ve already prepared it, then nevermind.\u201dThere weren\u2019t that many people in the Yu family, but this New Year\u2019s meal was very heartwarming.The Yu family of three and Shang Que sat around the table. There were two intricate food bowls next to the table for Peppa and the wet nurse duck to eat out of.While eating, Mother Yu also put food in Shang Que\u2019s bowl. The more she looked at him, the more she liked him. She couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cXiao Shang, how about coming to our home to spend every New Year from here on out?\u201dFather Yu glared at her. \u201cWhat are you saying? Doesn\u2019t Xiao Shang need to get married?\u201dOnly to see Shang Que nod very casually. \u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cHear that?\u201d Mother Yu glared back at Father Yu, pleased. Then, she lamented slightly regretfully, \u201cAiyo, how wonderful it would be if our Zhengdu were a girl. Then, he and Xiao Shang could\u2026\u2026\u201dFather Yu: \u201cAre you saying random things again?\u201dYu Zhengdu smiled mysteriously. \u201cWho knows.\u201dFather Yu didn\u2019t understand, but this didn\u2019t prevent Mother Yu from being extremely cheery. She gave Shang Que a piece of scallion oil chicken. \u201cXiao Shang, here. Have some of that \u2018scallion.\u2019\u201dThe scallion oil chicken ultimately got brought out to the table. However, out of respect for the goose and duck, they didn\u2019t call it \u201cchicken.\u201d Instead, they used a code name to replace it.Yu Zhengdu checked on how well Peppa and the wet nurse duck were eating and stood up to add some fresh grains and sliced fruit into their bowls.Mother Yu glanced over as well. She was instantly shocked. \u201cAiya, this goose and duck have been eating for all this time but haven\u2019t even spilled anything at all?\u201dNormally, when avians ate, it was inevitable for some food to get spilled all over the place. The Yu parents had already been prepared for these two pets to make a mess of their house. Unexpectedly, this duck and goose were very elegant. They were eating more cleanly than young children.Yu Zhengdu vaguely explained, \u201cXiao Shang trained them well.\u201dAs soon as he finished saying this, he saw the duck wiggle its b.u.t.t and waddle in the direction of the living room.Mother Yu instantly stood up. \u201cIs the duck about to run away?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Yu Zhengdu waved his hands. \u201cIt\u2019s only going to the bathroom.\u201dFather Yu was surprised. \u201cXiao Shang\u2019s duck is potty trained?\u201dYu Zhengdu offhandedly replied, \u201cThat\u2019s nothing. Peppa even knows how to flush the toilet.\u201dMother and Father Yu together: \u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dAfter dinner, Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que were forced into the living room to watch TV by Yu Zhengdu\u2019s parents. The Spring Festival Gala hadn\u2019t started yet; right now, the channel was broadcasting the news. The news was mainly reporting on the different situations all over the world where people were preparing to welcome the new year. The atmosphere was cheery everywhere.While clearing the table, Mother Yu made small talk with the two of them. Suddenly, the peaceful and cheery news broadcast became interrupted by an unfortunate piece of breaking news: \u201c\u2026\u2026Mountain Range Si suddenly experienced great rainfall, which caused a landslide. Many tourists have been trapped. Local first responders are in the middle of planning an emergency rescue\u2026\u2026As of now, we are reminding all tourists to be careful while travelling during the new year\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter hearing this, Mother Yu sighed. \u201cHow terrible. It\u2019s the new year, but such a catastrophe has occurred\u2026\u2026\u201dFather Yu popped half of his body out from the kitchen and nodded too. \u201cHopefully the people stuck there are okay and safe.\u201dYu Zhengdu hurriedly ran over to open his suitcase. He pulled out his laptop, turned it on, and started checking the data fluctuations on the Life and Death Accounts.Upon seeing this, Mother Yu furrowed her brows. \u201cHow come you still have to work over the new year?\u201dShang Que waved his hands. \u201cThere\u2019s an urgent issue.\u201dMother and Father Yu were still a bit suspicious, but since the boss was saying this, they didn\u2019t ask any other questions. Fortunately, Yu Zhengdu set his laptop down after a brief period of time. He whispered to Shang Que, \u201cThe numbers are normal. There probably won\u2019t be too many dead or wounded.\u201dHowever, it was unavoidable that the people trapped and their family members would be worried for a while.Shang Que caressed Yu Zhengdu\u2019s neck while smiling. \u201cLife and death are fated. You don\u2019t need to worry.\u201dYu Zhengdu didn\u2019t respond, but did relax quite a bit. He wanted to switch to a more lighthearted topic of conversation. At this time, though, Shang Que\u2019s phone suddenly beeped.Shang Que picked it up and looked at it. He was slightly surprised.Yu Zhengdu asked, \u201cWhat?\u201dShang Que handed his phone over after glancing at it. It was a message from Wei Xiao:\u3010Boss Shang, Happy New Year. This is lucky money for Peppa.\u3011Wei Xiao:\u3010[Fee transfer]\u3011Wei Xiao:\u3010[Fee transfer]\u3011Wei Xiao:\u3010[Fee transfer]\u3011Wei Xiao transferred over three red envelopes filled with sixty thousand each. In total, this was one hundred eighty thousand.Shang Que:\u3010?\u3011Wei Xiao:\u3010How fortunate I asked Peppa. Otherwise, my entire family would\u2019ve gone to Si Mountain Ridge over the holidays.\u3011Yu Zhengdu: \u201cUh\u2026\u2026\u201dHe squatted down next to Peppa and seriously asked her, \u201cPeppa, did you predict Wei Xiao\u2019s future?\u201dPeppa guiltily stuffed her goose head into her wings.Upon seeing this, Shang Que squatted down too. \u201cPeppa, don\u2019t be nervous. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s once in a while.\u201dOnly now did Peppa peek her head out.Yu Zhengdu looked at Shang Que in exasperation. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep spoiling her like this.\u201d\u201cI trust that Peppa wouldn\u2019t act out of line,\u201d Shang Que said. \u201cSee? Wei Xiao immediately spread some of his wealth. He\u2019s a smart man.\u201dYu Zhengdu thought about it and realized this was true. Thus, he stroked Peppa\u2019s wings. \u201cThen nevermind this time.\u201dHis eyes curved into crescents. \u201cI\u2019ll save your lucky money for you. You\u2019ll be able to pay for your own cla.s.ses in the future.\u201dPeppa proudly flapped her wings. \u201cGa ga\u2014\u2014\u201dAfter saying this, Yu Zhengdu felt a bit thirsty. Consequently, he stood up to get some water \u2013 he also poured out a cup of water for Shang Que. Unexpectedly, when he came back, he saw Shang Que leaning down next to Peppa\u2019s head. He sneakily bargained, \u201cPeppa, give me one of your red envelopes, please? My allowance is even less than yours!\u201dPeppa pitifully quacked, \u201cGa\u2014\u2014\u201dThus, Shang Que happily sat up straight again, just in time to make eye contact with Yu Zhengdu.Shang Que: \u201c\u2026\u2026Peppa herself said she wanted to give it to me!\u201dYu Zhengdu said, pained, \u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019ll raise your allowance.\u201d<b>The author has something to say:</b>Regarding the noises geese make, I did download some videos and audio files to examine them. However, I couldn\u2019t find the perfect onomatopoeia. It sounds a bit like \u201cge ge\u201d \u201cga ga\u201d \u201cah ah\u201d mixed together, so I chose \u201cga ga\u201d\u2026\u2026Shang Que: Happy!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Mother and Father Yu opened WeChat and greeted each and every one of their relatives and friends. Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que received numerous New Year\u2019s greetings from their coworkers and collaborators.Yu Zhengdu replied to all of these people, then gave Mother and Father Yu red envelopes.Upon seeing this, Shang Que also gave these two elders a big red envelope. The Yu parents jumped in fright after seeing the amount in Shang Que\u2019s red envelope. They refused to accept it no matter what. In the end, it was Yu Zhengdu who helped them click \u201caccept\u201d. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Just accept Xiao Shang\u2019s red envelope for you guys.\u201dFather Yu looked embarra.s.sed. \u201cZhengdu , in the next life, you\u2019ll have to work very, very hard to repay Xiao Shang.\u201dYu Zhengdu sweatdropped. He hurriedly waved his hands. \u201cIt\u2019s the New Year, don\u2019t say such unlucky things.\u201dMother Yu\u2019s smile refused to go away. She immediately took a picture with Shang Que and posted it to her Moments.Yu Zhengdu: ???Mother Yu had a very reasonable argument: \u201cI\u2019ve posted pictures of my son for twenty-something years already. n.o.body finds them interesting anymore. This year, I\u2019m posting a picture of my son\u2019s boss.\u201dEspecially because this was an extremely handsome boss.Yu Zhengdu actually had no response to this.Peppa had originally been taking a walk around the living room with the wet nurse duck. Upon seeing this, she flapped her wings and walked over to the couch. She reached her neck out and rubbed against Yu Zhengdu. Yu Zhengdu chuckled and stroked her wings. \u201cI prepared your lucky money too. I\u2019ve already put it away for you.\u201dPeppa flapped her wings. \u201cGa\u2014\u2014\u201dAnd then she turned her little head to stare straight at Shang Que. Her beady little eyes were furiously signalling a message to him.Shang Que reluctantly said, \u201cI saved some lucky money for you too.\u201dOriginally, he had already prepared the red envelope in advance. But because Peppa suddenly received an enormous amount of money from Wei Xiao, Ghost King Dad unexpectedly ate a huge lemon . He felt somewhat pained now as he gave the red envelope away.Peppa wasn\u2019t at the age where she could empathize with her dad yet. She happily clapped her wings together. \u201cGa ga\u2014\u2014\u201dThe more Father and Mother Yu observed Peppa, the more interesting they found her. Mother Yu teased, \u201cEven geese get lucky money these days?\u201dShang Que couldn\u2019t help acting out on a bad habit that human parents had. He unlocked his phone and started playing music. Then, he ordered Peppa, \u201cGo, dance for Grandpa and Grandma.\u201dMother and Father Yu stuttered out, \u201cN-no need\u2026\u2026\u201d It didn\u2019t seem right to trouble a goose like this.Just as they said this, they noticed that Peppa had already started moving to the music.\u201c Three circles to the left, three circles to the right ; move your neck, shake your b.u.t.t\u2026\u2026\u201d The goose turned to the left, turned to the right, moved her neck, and shook her b.u.t.t. Her little dress swished with her movements.Her webbed feet were also very in time with the rhythm!Mother and Father Yu with shocked faces: \u201cA magical goose\u2026\u2026\u201dThe two elders silently pulled out a red envelope they had prepared for the children and handed it over. \u201cHere, Peppa. This is a red envelope from Grandpa and Grandma.\u201dPeppa happily plopped her head into Mother Yu\u2019s lap. She flapped her wings. \u201cGa ga\u2014\u2014\u201dMother Yu\u2019s heart had already melted. She picked the goose up, put her in her lap, and started stroking her. \u201cGood granddaughter, good granddaughter\u2014\u2014\u201dFrom off to the side, Father Yu kept shouting, \u201cLet me hug her. Let me hug her\u2014\u2014\u201dYu Zhengdu: = =Yu Zhengdu\u2019s family wasn\u2019t in the habit of waiting for the New Year\u2019s countdown. When they saw that it was about time, they all headed into their own rooms to rest. The Yu family\u2019s house wasn\u2019t very big; there were only three rooms in total. However, one room had always been used as a storage. It would be too difficult to tidy it up. Thus, Mother Yu only cleaned up Yu Zhengdu\u2019s bedroom.She apologetically looked at Shang Que. \u201cXiao Shang, I\u2019m really sorry. You\u2019ll have to make do these next few days and sleep in the same room as Zhengdu.\u201dShang Que maintained a straight face and said in a reserved tone, \u201cThat\u2019s no problem.\u201dYu Zhengdu purposefully teased him, \u201cHas Xiao Shang ever slept in the same room as someone in the past?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Shang Que replied. His gaze drifted a bit until it landed on Yu Zhengdu. \u201cBut I can get used to it.\u201dAnd then he got pushed by Yu Zhengdu into the bathroom to shower.After showering, Shang Que headed into the room first. When Yu Zhengdu walked into his room following his own shower, he saw that Shang Que had already changed into a set of cotton pullover pajamas and was leaning against the bed\u2019s headboard, playing on his phone. The background music of\u300aDream Tour of Fengdu\u300bcould faintly be heard.The game that Double Horn Technology and Luofeng had jointly developed,\u300aDream Tour of Fengdu\u300b, had been officially released prior to the New Year. Yu Zhengdu didn\u2019t understand games, so hadn\u2019t gotten involved in the game\u2019s development at all. Though he had asked about the progress a few times, to this day, he still didn\u2019t really know what the final version of\u300aDream Tour of Fengdu\u300bwas like. He only knew that after its release, this game had been greatly welcomed. Next year, it was very likely that Luofeng would gain a lot of dividends\u2014\u2014that was enough!Instead, Shang Que was the one who had started making time everyday after the game\u2019s release to log in and play. However, he had always been like this regarding gaming. Yu Zhengdu had already gotten used to it and didn\u2019t find this strange at all.The one thing that made him feel perplexed was that in the past, Shang Que had always acted like he had been possessed by an elementary school student while playing games. He would oftentimes start furiously typing messages to argue with his teammates. But this time, he acted strangely calm, even a bit pleased. It seemed like he was having a swell time in the game.Yu Zhengdu was slightly surprised in his heart. He had even secretly WeChat messaged Wei Xiao, asking if he had really listened to Shang Que\u2019s suggestions and given him a one-of-a-kind powerful weapon or something.Wei Xiao held his fingers up to the sky and swore on his own morality that he absolutely wouldn\u2019t have done anything that could possibly ruin the game\u2019s equilibrium.Yu Zhengdu naturally wasn\u2019t questioning Wei Xiao\u2019s morality. Since Wei Xiao had already said this, he thus stopped thinking about this abnormality.However, now that he was seeing Shang Que\u2019s strange smile again, he still couldn\u2019t help feeling a bit curious. He offhandedly asked, \u201cAre you really good at this game now?\u201d\u201c ,\u201d Shang Que\u2019s tone was pleased. \u201cI\u2019m the best at this game.\u201dYu Zhengdu was slightly surprised. \u201cDidn\u2019t Wei Xiao say that he didn\u2019t design a precious giant sword for you or anything?\u201dKnowing Shang Que\u2019s gaming skills, given that he wasn\u2019t cheating in any manner, it was completely impossible for him to become undefeatable in such a short period of time.\u201cIt\u2019s true he didn\u2019t\u2026\u2026\u201d Shang Que was just about to say something when he noticed out of his periphery that Yu Zhengdu was drying his hair while sliding under the blankets. He had originally been focused on the game. Now that he saw Yu Zhengdu climbing into bed, he unknowingly started getting distracted.Especially because the Yu family\u2019s shampoo and body wash had been bought by Mother Yu. After a shower, one would faintly carry a fragrance with them.Shang Que couldn\u2019t be bothered to keep gaming. He silently set down his phone and blurted out, voice tense, \u201cYour hair\u2019s not dry yet.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll dry very soon.\u201d Before the new year, Yu Zhengdu had gotten a buzz cut. Though his hair was still as dense as before, it was now a lot shorter: very nice and neat. He wiped it for a while and, after confirming that no water was dripping down, he started ignoring it. He leaned against the headboard and started playing on his phone.The smell of the shampoo drifted into Shang Que\u2019s nostrils. Shang Que was completely distracted. He stiffly reached out and pushed Yu Zhengdu. \u201cNo, it\u2019s too wet. Dry it off some more.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m tired.\u201d It was rare for Yu Zhengdu to have a break. His entire being felt lazy. After being pushed by Shang Que, he instantly felt rebellious. He purposefully pressed his wet head against Shang Que\u2019s neck. \u201cIf you mind so much, just dry my hair off for me.\u201dThe side of Shang Que\u2019s face and his neck fell victim to this wet, short hair. An itch instantly creeped up his heart. His hand that had originally been resting on Yu Zhengdu\u2019s shoulder now reflexively tightened, maintaining a grip on Yu Zhengdu.He softly coughed once before nonchalantly saying, \u201cThen I\u2019ll dry your hair off.\u201dYu Zhengdu felt slightly surprised. When he turned around, Shang Que had already grabbed the towel and was in the right posture to start wiping his head.Yu Zhengdu couldn\u2019t help laughing out loud. He obediently scooted closer to Shang Que. \u201cOkay.\u201dGossip ForumHeading: Dream Tour of Fengdu, Is There Anyone Luckier Than Me? The Ghost King Went Into an Instance Dungeon With Me!!Building Owner: Aaaah, I\u2019m so excited I\u2019m speechless! These past few days, I\u2019ve often seen posts by other sisters who have encountered the Ghost King in the game in varying different ways. I was really so jealous I turned into a lemon. Even though I clearly spent all my free time in the game, I never encountered the Ghost King at all.Never in my wildest dreams had I expected this!!! Saying it out loud is a bit embarra.s.sing, but I ate too much dinner last night because of the new year, so I had to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night. Thus, I also logged into the game. And then!! I actually encountered the Ghost King. Additionally, the Ghost King was in a great mood. He actually went into an instance dungeon with me and even let me choose which instance dungeon! I chose the Mountain Knife h.e.l.l , which I previously had never managed to pa.s.s. Everyone knows that the Eighteen Levels of h.e.l.l instance dungeons are all truly h.e.l.lish instance dungeons to pa.s.s. My friends and I had already died in the Mountain Knife h.e.l.l many times. But! Everyone knows what G.o.d-level type boss the Ghost King is. With his help, I pa.s.sed the entire instance dungeon myself. My friends were astounded when they woke up! I had to give them several red envelopes to quell their fury!Floor 1: Another European has appeared. I hate!Floor 2: Clicking into this post to get some of Building Owner\u2019s ghostly energy\u2026\u2026ah no, fortunate energy!Floor 3: What? The Ghost King can even enter instance dungeons with players???Floor 4: Yes, the Ghost King can join players\u2019 teams. Didn\u2019t a different post already share this fact before? However, that time, their team coincidentally triggered the plot of encountering the Ghost King outside of the instance dungeon. What\u2019s more surprising to me is\u2026\u2026the Ghost King can let players choose the instance dungeon?Floor 5: Building Owner has really good luck. My friends once also triggered the plot of encountering the Ghost King while inside an instance dungeon. However, the Ghost King was in a terrible mood that time, so killed their entire team. However, my friends thought that being able to encounter a rare boss was worth being killed 23333.Floor 6: Shocked, the Ghost King can also appear inside instance dungeons?Floor 7: Upstairs, Wei Xiao said before that the Ghost King can randomly appear anywhere.Floor 8: It has to be said that Boss Wei truly is a top notch game designer. This NPC that he has designed is honestly too amazing\u2026\u2026I just want to ask the Ghost King: how many more surprises do you have that I don\u2019t know about.jpgFloor 203: Aaah, can the building owner say where you encountered the Ghost King? What did you do or say before encountering the Ghost King? Why did the Ghost King agree to let you choose the instance dungeon?Floor 204: Upstairs, how come you\u2019re still asking about that? Wei Xiao has already said innumerous times that the conditions for triggering an encounter with the Ghost King are completely random. There\u2019s no order to it. The Ghost King\u2019s mood and actions are also completely random. It all depends on a player\u2019s luck.Floor 205: No wait. I always thought that Wei Xiao was just bluffing? The Ghost King is the biggest boss in the entire game. How could the conditions that trigger an encounter with him truly be completely random??Floor 206: Well the truth is that they really are completely random. Honestly speaking, none of the conditions shared in all the online posts regarding what they did when they encountered the Ghost King are the same, okay? I originally tried exactly what those posts said, but never ended up successful\u2026\u2026Ah, I\u2019m an unlucky African !Floor 207: Let\u2019s be reasonable. Ox Factory even dared to create a one-of-a-kind ultimate NPC who can punish or reward players in completely random ways. Random triggering conditions are nothing compared to that\u2026\u2026Floor 208: Plus one with 207 jiejieFloor 555: To tell the truth, when Dream Tour of Fengdu first got released and Wei Xiao said that such a boss had been designed into the game, I thought that he had gone crazy. An ultimate NPC whose behavior can\u2019t be predicted at all \u2013 was he trying to drive players crazy? But unexpectedly, the Ghost King has become one of the highlights of this game. I know a lot of people that usually never game but have specially created accounts for Dream Tour of Fengdu just to encounter the legendary Ghost King.Floor 556: But the Ghost King is honestly really amusing. I don\u2019t know how Ox Factory managed to design his language systems. Sometimes, he\u2019s clearly very elegant and even says things in a flowery, historical tone. But sometimes, he\u2019s also very similar to an elementary schooler. Hasn\u2019t someone been called \u201ctrash\u201d by him before?Floor 557: I have a friend who makes games for a different big tech company. He told me that because of the Ghost King\u2019s great popularity, right now, a lot of gaming companies are trying to imitate Ox Factory and design a similar boss. However, they have yet to succeed in overcoming the technological issues. Don\u2019t know how Ox Factory managed to do it.Floor 558: Isn\u2019t this game co-created by Ox Factory and Luofeng? Luofeng has the two big bosses osone and singer. Perhaps they were the technical directors for this game??Floor 888: So, Building Owner has yet to share \u2013 what exactly did you tell the Ghost King? To get him to take you into an instance dungeon?Building Owner: Uh, I don\u2019t know what happened either? However, when I encountered the Ghost King, the Ghost King asked me, \u201cDoes your significant other ask you to dry their hair for them?\u201d I answered, \u201cNo.\u201d Then, the Ghost King said, \u201cHow pitiful. I\u2019ll take you into an instance dungeon then.\u201dFloor 1111: What does the Ghost King mean???Over the Lunar New Year, Double Horn Technology\u2019s new mobile game,\u300aDream Tour of Fengdu\u300b, blew up on the Internet. This game had been adapted from the Ghost Festival Garden Party IP owned by Luofeng.Luofeng\u2019s Ghost Festival Garden Party had already ended up on the trending topics list in the past. Many netizens had strong impressions of it. As such, it could be said that this game had already garnered a lot of attention since the beginning. Additionally, Double Horn Technology cared greatly about this game. They invested a lot of money and resources into its promotion and operations. Prior to its release, the game had already gone viral. Many netizens had long since expressed their antic.i.p.ation for this game.Double Horn Technology had started off by making large-scale online games. They were one of the oldest game companies in the industry. However, following the rise in popularity of mobile games, Double Horn had been a step late in breaking into the new industry. In the past two years, they had only received so-so reviews for the mobile games they had released. Slowly, they were slipping into that awkward dilemma of having to rely on their past gains.Prior to the release of Dream Tour of Fengdu, a lot of a.n.a.lysts had even said that Double Horn was starting on a downward decline. They believed that it was very possible for Double Horn to become the next big company to collapse.Dream Tour of Fengdu\u2019s release was a big slap in the face for those people.The day the game officially became released, the number of registrations practically broke the industry record. After the subsequent good reviews, the number of users incessantly reached new highs, almost causing Double Horn Technology\u2019s servers to crash. This resulted in Double Horn Technology having to send out an emergency notice to some of their programmers over break, asking them to come back to the company and work overtime.And\u300aDream Tour of Fengdu\u300bitself didn\u2019t fail to live up to the users\u2019 expectations. The day it got released, it ended up on the trending topics list multiple times. Some of these had been bought by Double Horn, but others had actually been caused by netizens. However, the one similarity between all of them was that if you clicked into them, they were almost all praising the game.The game had an enormous map with intricate settings. The plotline was also quite complete. It had practically perfectly recreated the Underworld of Huaxia legends. At the same time, it also had many diverse and interesting instance dungeons. Aside from the \u201cEight Underworld Mountain Views\u201d and Ghost Market that everyone was already familiar with, there were also the Eighteen Levels of h.e.l.l, the Court of Yama, the Hungry Ghost Path, Fengdu Ghost City, etc. Aside from the Hundred Ghosts, NPCs also included varying types of Underworld creatures. Because this was a game designed for the general public, though, these characters had been slightly beautified while still maintaining their defining characteristics.It could be said that even those who weren\u2019t usual gamers would feel like it was very worth it to play this game just to see these scenes. In actuality, there were also a lot of people here just for the Underworld map. Many joked that this was a unique virtual tour experience.\u300aDream Tour of Fengdu\u300breceived many great reviews after its release. Additionally, over the New Year, it broke the domestic mobile game record for most number of people online at the same time. Discussions related to it could always be found online; it was on the trending topics list everyday.But n.o.body had ever expected that the one thing that would cause this game to go completely viral was the ultimate NPC in the game\u2014\u2014the Ghost King.\u300aDream Tour of Fengdu\u300bwas the same as all other games. It contained varying different types of instance dungeons and multiple big and little bosses. However, it was also different from all other games\u2014\u2014it had designed what was supposedly a one-of-a-kind Ghost King boss.During the press conference, Wei Xiao had talked about this Ghost King NPC with everyone in a somewhat embarra.s.sed manner. Apparently, the Ghost King had been personally designed by him. It had invincible magic powers and couldn\u2019t be defeated by any players.These characteristics weren\u2019t a big deal. What caused everyone to feel the most surprise was the fact that everything regarding this Ghost King was completely random: he could randomly appear anywhere (including inside instance dungeons), randomly be encountered by any players, randomly communicate with players, randomly join players\u2019 teams or become the enemy, randomly punish or reward players, etc.At first, everyone had only thought that this was a promotional stint on Ox Factory\u2019s part. How could the biggest boss in a game actually be completely random? However, after the game had been released for a while and more and more players had encountered the Ghost King, gradually, everyone realized\u2014\u2014everything really was random.Meeting the Ghost King at the same time and then doing and saying the same things. Some people would earn the Ghost King\u2019s reward, while others would instantly get smacked to death by the Ghost King. Others still would be invited by the Ghost King to enter an instance dungeon together\u2014\u2014Because of the fact that the Ghost King had undefeatable magic powers, these players would oftentimes be able to safely pa.s.s these instance dungeons. However, some teams would also get killed inside the instance dungeon by the Ghost King.Many players collected all the posts regarding encounters with the Ghost King and tried to figure out his behavior patterns, but ultimately failed\u2014\u2014Just as Wei Xiao had said during the press conference, the Ghost King was unpredictable.More unpredictable was the fact that the Ghost King had somehow become the most popular character in the entire game\u2014\u2014the kind that was on a completely different level than all other characters.And the reason was exactly because of how random the Ghost King was. This caused encountering the Ghost King to become one of the highest honors in the game. The Ghost King also became the fairest NPC in the hearts of all players, because regardless of if you were the type to spend a fortune on games or if you were an extremely skilled gamer, everyone received the same treatment from the Ghost King.There were also others who felt like the Ghost King wasn\u2019t as boring and unnatural as other NPCs. He was very vibrant, just like a character that truly existed. This allowed the game to feel more realistic.Over New Year\u2019s vacation, aside from New Year\u2019s greetings, the most frequent messages that Yu Zhengdu received were ones inviting him to come play Dream Tour of Fengdu. There were also a lot of people asking him if he knew how to encounter the Ghost King.Only now did Yu Zhengdu find out that such a NPC existed in this game. However, he honestly wasn\u2019t very familiar with this game. He could only very regretfully reply to everyone, saying that he didn\u2019t know either.However, as the game got more and more popular, Yu Zhengdu occasionally saw related news about it on the trending topics list. Gradually, he started getting curious too. After all, this was one of Luofeng\u2019s products too. It wouldn\u2019t be wrong to gain an understanding of it.Since he had the free time, Yu Zhengdu decided to download Dream Tour of Fengdu and let Shang Que teach him how to play. As such, he began his first mobile game experience.This game used WeChat for registration. As soon as Yu Zhengdu successfully finished registering, he received many messages from his friends:\u3010You\u2019ve finally registered too. Hurry, come play with me\u3011\u3010Where are you? I\u2019ll go find you\u3011\u3010Aaah, hurry and tell me how I can encounter the Ghost King\u3011Yu Zhengdu sweatdropped. He replied:\u3010I honestly don\u2019t know 0.0 Isn\u2019t it completely random?\u3011Under Shang Que\u2019s guidance, Yu Zhengdu finally managed to finish the novice missions with great difficulty.Very quickly, Zhu Yan sent him a message:\u3010Zhengdu! You\u2019ve registered too! Just in time. Yihua and I have found a thigh to cling onto. We\u2019re in the middle of making a team to go into an instance dungeon. Hurry and come. We can play together\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010No thanks, I\u2019m still somewhat unsure about how to play. What if I delay your guys\u2019 progress later?\u3011Zhu Yan:\u3010Are we people who would be scared of you delaying our progress? Quit making excuses and come over!\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010Okay then\u3011Yu Zhengdu rather unfamiliarly rushed to the entrance of the \u201c h.e.l.l of Tongue Removal .\u201d This was the easiest instance dungeon of the Eighteen Levels of h.e.l.l instance dungeons. It was also the only h.e.l.l instance dungeon that Yu Zhengdu could enter given his current level.He had originally thought that Zhu Yan and them had specially chosen this easiest instance dungeon out of consideration for him. However, when he reached the entrance and looked around, he instantly went: = =Only to see that a row of newbies were lined up across from him. Aside from Zhang Qingqing, who worked at Double Horn Technology, the player with the highest level \u2013 Zhu Yan \u2013 was only three levels higher than him. No wonder he had said they weren\u2019t scared of him delaying their progress. It was hard to tell at this point who would be delaying who.The thigh: Zhang Qingqing.When Zhang Qingqing noticed him, she commanded:\u3010Everyone\u2019s here. Enter the instance dungeon\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010Wait\u3011He glanced at Shang Que and asked, \u201cWant to play with us?\u201dShang Que glanced over at the instance dungeon they had chosen and reservedly said, \u201cYou guys can play by yourselves first. I\u2019ll go find you later.\u201dYu Zhengdu didn\u2019t mind either. Zhu Yan was rus.h.i.+ng him. Thus, he hurriedly clicked the \u201cconfirm\u201d b.u.t.ton and followed the others into the instance dungeon.It had to be said that h.e.l.l instance dungeons were truly h.e.l.lish. Even the easiest level, the h.e.l.l of Tongue Removal, was something this group of newbies couldn\u2019t defeat. This group of people travelled through the instance dungeon while incessantly wailing:Jia Yihua:\u3010Aaah, there\u2019s a ghost. Save me!!\u3011Zhang Qingqing:\u3010Shut up. Don\u2019t disrupt my performance\u3011Jia Yihua\u2019s Wife:\u3010Save me save me!\u3011Zhang Qingqing:\u3010Sister-in-law, stay further away from your husband. Being alone keeps you safe\u3011Jia Yihua:\u3010I feel like you\u2019re implying something?\u3011Zhu Yan:\u3010I\u2019m about to die. Qingqing hurry and come!\u3011Zhang Qingqing:\u3010Can\u2019t you guys be like Zhengdu and stay calm?\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010\u2026\u2026Uh 0.0\u3011Zhu Yan:\u3010Take a good look. Zhengdu isn\u2019t calm, he\u2019s already dead\u3011After watching her weaka.s.s cla.s.smates all die, Thigh Zhang Qingqing felt completely hopeless. She sighed loudly:\u3010Nevermind, I\u2019ll commit suicide. It\u2019ll be faster to get out when we\u2019re all dead\u3011Everyone:\u3010Qingqing, don\u2019t give up so easily! We\u2019re still depending on you!\u3011Zhang Qingqing:\u3010Don\u2019t! After we get out of this instance dungeon! I\u2019m going to completely abandon you guys!\u3011Everyone:\u3010\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u3011Zhang Qingqing:\u3010If I carry you guys two more times, I might not survive past this New Year\u3011Everyone:\u3010\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u3011Amidst several death glares, Zhang Qingqing controlled her character and walked towards the instance dungeon boss with great dignity, acting like she was brave and righteous.Yu Zhengdu felt slightly guilty. He remembered Shang Que, who claimed to be undefeatable in this game. He hurriedly comforted Zhang Qingqing:\u3010Qingqing, don\u2019t feel too hopeless. Wait for me to find a skilled friend to carry us through the game\u3011Zhang Qingqing:\u3010Spare your friend, please\u3011Zhang Qingqing:\u3010Given your guys\u2019 levels, unless the Ghost King joins our team, don\u2019t even think about pa.s.sing this instance dungeon\u3011Just as she finished speaking, everyone suddenly heard a \u201cding\u2014\u2014\u201d. They simultaneously received a system notification:\u3010Triggered plot: Encountering the Ghost King\u3011Everyone inhaled sharply:\u3010!!!!! The Ghost King!\u3011The Ghost King, dressed in black robes and wearing a suit of armor, fell from the sky. From high up, he stared down at them:\u3010I\u2019m in a good mood today, so will help you guys pa.s.s this h.e.l.l of Tongue Removal!\u3011Everyone:\u3010Wow\u2014\u2014\u3011The Ghost King\u2019s lines were really very random!Yu Zhengdu instinctively felt like something was off. He looked up and saw that at some unknown time, Shang Que had also pulled out his phone. He was in the middle of playing some game.He slightly furrowed his brows and peeked over. And then: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu turned to look at Shang Que in shock. \u201cYou\u2019re the one controlling the Ghost King!!!!\u201dShang Que revealed a pleased expression. \u201cYes.\u201dIn the game, the Ghost King used his limitless power to easily help this group of rookies pa.s.s the h.e.l.l of Tongue Removal. But for everyone, this was no longer the important part.The important part was, they had encountered the Ghost King!The plot of encountering the Ghost King, which was supposedly very unlikely to trigger, had actually been triggered by them!These cla.s.smates all started daydreaming. They discussed which European had gotten extremely lucky and saved everyone.Zhu Yan:\u3010It must be me! My mom predicted my future over the new year and said I would get rich this year!\u3011Zhang Qingqing:\u3010Forget it. It\u2019s definitely me. When the Ghost King appeared, I was the only one still alive!\u3011Jia Yihua:\u3010Can\u2019t it be me? My wife and I are both here. Double the luck\u3011Just as everyone was arguing, the Ghost King suddenly walked up to Yu Zhengdu\u2019s character:\u3010You\u2019re so good looking. How about I give you a present?!\u3011Everyone:\u3010????\u3011At the same time, the system released a new announcement:\u3010Player \u201cAutumn Rain Doesn\u2019t Cross the River\u201d has triggered the Ghost King\u2019s friendly feelings, receiving xx experience points and the ultimate magical weapon, Ghost King\u2019s Magical Seal\u3011The world exploded.<b>The author has something to say:</b>Friend (pointing at Zhengdu): And you still say you don\u2019t know how to encounter the Ghost King!!Zhengdu: 0.0 It was the Ghost King who came to encounter me.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If you ask, the answer is \u201crandom\u201d, understand?\u3011At the same time, Yu Zhengdu\u2019s private messages and inbox got flooded. His friends on WeChat sent him strings upon strings of exclamation marks:\u3010And you said you don\u2019t know how to encounter the Ghost King!!!\u3011On the other hand, his inbox was full of strangers asking him if he was interested in selling the Magical Seal or not.Yu Zhengdu:\u3010\u2026\u2026\u3011Yu Zhengdu quickly changed his settings so that he wouldn\u2019t receive any messages from strangers. Then, he looked at Shang Que, speechless: \u201c\u2026\u2026Why are you the one in control of the Ghost King?\u201dShang Que held his hands out innocently. \u201cWei Xiao designed it.\u201dYu Zhengdu\u2019s expression conveyed his suspicion. \u201cWhy would Wei Xiao make such a design?\u201dAs soon as he finished asking this, his WeChat dinged with a notification. Wei Xiao had sent him a message:\u3010I heard you received the Ghost King\u2019s Magical Seal?\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010I know your guys\u2019 secret now!!\u3011Wei Xiao:\u3010What?!!!\u3011Wei Xiao:\u3010Please keep it an absolute secret!!

It wasn\u2019t like I could actually make him a special weapon, right\u2026\u2026\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010\u2026\u2026\u3011Wei Xiao:\u3010So if he really wanted to be invincible, he could only become a NPC\u3011Yu Zhengdu:\u3010\u2026\u2026\u3011Yu Zhengdu:k3010;You\u2019ve worked hard, fist salute.jpgk3011;The Ghost King\u2019s friendly feelings and Ghost King\u2019s Magical Seal very quickly ended up on the trending topics list. Double Horn Technology took this opportunity to start another round of promotions. Immediately, the game\u2019s popularity became even greater.All sorts of posts started showing up on the forum too. Everybody cussed out the evil European while wis.h.i.+ng they could instantly sneak themselves into Europe.Though the official game developers had emphasized the unpredictability of the Ghost King many times, and though netizens had already proven numerous times that encountering the Ghost King was completely random, there were still people who pitifully asked player Autumn Rain Doesn\u2019t Cross the River how he had managed to trigger the Ghost King\u2019s friendly feelings.Eventually, an extremely resourceful netizen found out what had happened that night after repeated inquiries. They posted the circ.u.mstances of the event onto the forum. This caused a new round of angry cussing from netizens.Heading: Apparently, At the Time, the Ghost King Told the European G.o.d: You\u2019re So Good LookingBuilding owner: Same as heading.Floor 1: ?? These days, even NPC\u2019s look at people\u2019s faces ?Floor 2: ?? These days, even NPC\u2019s look at people\u2019s faces?Floor 3: ?? These days, even NPC\u2019s look at people\u2019s faces?Floor 4: I hadn\u2019t thought that the good looking Ghost King would be a face-judger?Floor 5: I hate this world that judges people by their facesFloor 6: Even the Underworld looks at people\u2019s faces?Floor 7: So actually how good looking is Autumn Rain Doesn\u2019t Cross the River?Later on, someone exposed the fact that Autumn Rain Doesn\u2019t Cross the River was actually Senior. The netizens who heard about this all expressed: oh, then he really is very good looking.There were also a small group of people who suspected that Senior, as one of Luofeng\u2019s high-level administrators, had perhaps used his authority to figure out the game\u2019s rules or something. However, as soon as these suspicions got stated, they very quickly got extinguished. This was because it had been exposed many times before that even Double Horn Technology\u2019s high-level administrators were asking about how to encounter the Ghost King. Additionally, some people offered a lot of money while contacting Yu Zhengdu in private, trying to buy the Ghost King\u2019s Magical Seal from him; they all got rejected. Even Ox Factory\u2019s high-level administrators couldn\u2019t figure out the Ghost King\u2019s behavior patterns. How could Luofeng\u2019s high-level administrators know\u2014\u2014 However, this was technically the truth, seeing as Yu Zhengdu truly didn\u2019t know.Regretfully, the Ghost King\u2019s Magical Seal, which had become a temporary sensation, ultimately didn\u2019t get to show off its power. Yu Zhengdu was terrified that if he logged into the game again, he would quickly receive all the treasures in the game. Thus, he rapidly ended his gaming career, only leaving an everlasting legend and countless wails of misery in his wake\u2014\u2014On the morning of the fifth day of the new year, the sound of firecrackers could be heard throughout all of Jintan Village. This shocked awake Yu Zhengdu, who had originally been sleeping. His eyes shot open, just in time to meet Shang Que\u2019s gaze.Shang Que had already woken up at an unknown time. He had an arm over Yu Zhengdu\u2019s waist and was silently staring at him.The two of them had already slept in the same bed for many days. Yu Zhengdu had long since gotten used to waking up in Shang Que\u2019s arms. However, it was still the first time that he was seeing the other in such close proximity.Only now did he discover that Shang Que was actually equally as handsome when lying down. As such, he temporarily wasn\u2019t able to resist scooting close and kissing him.And then Shang Que tightened his arms even more around Yu Zhengdu.Mother Yu knocked on the door. \u201cZhengdu, Xiao Shang, you guys need to get up early today. We\u2019re going to go wors.h.i.+p the G.o.ds at the public ancestral temple together after sending off the ghost of poverty.\u201dImmediately after, they heard the sound of Peppa flapping her wings. \u201cGa ga\u2014\u2014\u201dMother Yu: \u201cDoes Peppa want to go too?\u201dPeppa: \u201cGa\u2014\u2014\u201dMother Yu\u2019s voice was filled with amus.e.m.e.nt. \u201cOkay okay okay. Let\u2019s go together! I\u2019ll go prepare your breakfast first.\u201dAnd then they heard Father Yu say, \u201cThen come do morning exercises with me on the patio, Peppa!\u201dMother Yu: \u201cWhat morning exercises? We\u2019re going to have to walk to the public ancestral temple later. Don\u2019t tire Peppa out.\u201dAfter a short Lunar New Year\u2019s break, Peppa Goose\u2019s status in the Yu family had shot straight up. She had even replaced Shang Que as the newest model in Mother Yu\u2019s picture updates to her Moments. Father and Mother Yu fought everyday for the rights to walk the goose and duck. Additionally, they had successfully managed to become the two brightest stars in the Jintan Village\u2019s middle-aged community because of Peppa\u2019s \u201cHealthy Song\u201d dance.As Yu Zhengdu listened to his parents\u2019 conversation, his entire brain was filled with numerous ellipses. He also felt quite speechless. He silently threw back a corner of his blanket to get out of bed. However, Shang Que kept a tight clasp over his waist. His voice was a bit hoa.r.s.e. \u201cOne more kiss.\u201dYu Zhengdu looked at him with a smile of exasperation. \u201cBoss, certain things happen when we young men with normal bodily functions kiss for too long in the morning.\u201dShang Que\u2019s gaze guiltily looked off into the distance. \u201cCertain things have already happened\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHow truly unexpected. Even a thousand-year old ghost wasn\u2019t capable of controlling his own urges.However, Yu Zhengdu himself couldn\u2019t control his urges either. He wasn\u2019t qualified to be saying anything.Yu Zhengdu silently laid back down. \u201c\u2026\u2026Then I guess we can kiss a bit more.\u201dAfter breakfast, the Yu family of three brought Shang Que and Peppa to the Yu clan\u2019s public ancestral temple. Jintan Village was located in an isolated area; it had almost completely kept all of its old customs. Firecracker and fire restrictions weren\u2019t too strictly regulated. The entire way, they could see other families setting off firecrackers and throwing their garbage away to send off the ghost of poverty.Though Yu Zhengdu had watched all the families in this area send off the ghost of poverty since young, his generation no longer had a great understanding of this custom. Thus, Shang Que shared the story of the ghost of poverty with him along the way.The earliest legend of the ghost of poverty was about Zhuanxu\u2019s son. He was small and frail and had a natural inclination for wearing rundown clothes and drinking porridge . He had an unrestrained personality and had ultimately died because of this lack of restraint. When humans encountered this ghost, they would lose wealth. He was a very unwelcomed ghost.However, the customs relating to sending off poverty eventually became more for the purposes of avoiding evil, preventing catastrophe, welcoming blessings, and hoping for good fortune. This practice was also called sending off the ghost of poverty, sending off the five poverties , sending off the poor man, etc. Additionally, different regions had different customs regarding the time you were supposed to send off poverty and the way you were supposed to send off poverty.People across Huaxia would gradually start sending off poverty from the day before New Year\u2019s Eve at the earliest. Just the province that Shu City belonged to alone had multiple different customs for sending off poverty. Most of the locals at Jintan Village were businessmen. The market started back up on the sixth day of the new year. As such, local customs detailed sending off poverty on the fifth day of the new year.There were varying ways to send off poverty as well. However, the families of most places would just throw away all the garbage and debris they had collected since the start of the new year, then set off firecrackers to chase the ghost of poverty away. This was what Jintan Village did. As such, this practice was also called 'sending off poor debris.\u201d Other places were more fastidious, requiring paper cutouts of people to be thrown into the trash too. Or, there needed to be cars or boats made out of gra.s.s or paper as the \u201ctransportation\u201d for sending off the ghost of poverty. Some places even had certain actions that needed to be completed when throwing out the garbage. Examples included a certain place in the northwest that required the person to exit the house backwards while holding the trash, some places that needed to eat fried beans on the day of sending off poverty, etc.Mother Yu was walking in the front with Peppa. Father Yu was right behind Peppa, so was closer to Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que. After hearing Shang Que\u2019s explanation, he exclaimed, \u201cXiao Shang knows about quite a lot of stuff.\u201dRight after saying this, he added, \u201cBut that makes sense. Your company works in this field.\u201dShang Que didn\u2019t bother explaining himself. He just made a casual sound of acknowledgement.Father Yu asked again, \u201cThen can you tell us which custom is the most effective out of all the different types?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all the same,\u201d Shang Que said. \u201cAll customs, regardless of procedure, are an expression of wors.h.i.+p and belief. What\u2019s actually effective is the faith behind them. Everything else is only a form of performance. There is no better or worse variation.\u201dYu Zhengdu fell into thought. \u201cThis is the supposed \u2018belief makes things happen\u2019, right?\u201dShang Que nodded. \u201cYes.\u201dYu Zhengdu observed the cheery atmosphere all around them. Confused, he asked, \u201cBut what does the ghost of poverty actually look like? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen one.\u201dShang Que answered with a smile, \u201cThe earliest ghost of poverty has already become a G.o.d. Consequently, he disappeared when the Heavens and h.e.l.l collapsed. The ghosts of poverty among us now are mostly born around lazy people or in dirty environments. They are ultimately a minority.\u201dYu Zhengdu nodded in understanding.During their conversation, they had already reached the Yu clan\u2019s public ancestral temple. This public ancestral temple had originally been a place Yu Zhengdu had visited since young. Now, though, it was slightly different from before.On the right of the Yu clan\u2019s ancestral temple was a little temple. This had initially been used to wors.h.i.+p the Yu clan\u2019s ancestors, the Three G.o.ds. But last Qingming, Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que had unintentionally discovered that the Three G.o.ds had already fallen into evil. Shang Que had lowered thunder fire, smote the Three G.o.ds\u2019 Temple, and arrested the Three G.o.ds \u2013 who were brothers. After, the Yu clan had remodeled the little temple and invited Fu De True G.o.d back. Fu De True G.o.d had previously been driven out by the Three G.o.ds.When they arrived, there were already quite a lot of members of the Yu clan gathered by the public ancestral temple and wors.h.i.+pping their ancestors. Upon seeing Yu Zhengdu and them, they instantly surrounded them in greeting.These days, Yu Zhengdu\u2019s family\u2019s status was completely different in the Yu clan compared to what it had been in the past. After what had happened last Qingming, everyone all knew that Yu Zhengdu\u2019s company had some fancy technology that could connect the mortal realm and Underworld. To this day, Old Mr. Yu, the head of the Yu clansmen, was still a dedicated client of their company; he had bought Underworld communications services for the whole year.Father and Mother Yu greeted everyone individually. Only then did they take Yu Zhengdu, Shang Que, and Peppa into Fu De True G.o.d\u2019s temple.While walking, Mother Yu said, \u201cHow fortunate that Xiao Shang exposed the truth about the Three G.o.ds. Ever since we invited the Village G.o.d back last year, the entire Yu clan\u2019s luck really has gotten a lot better. Now, not only members of the Yu clan, but a lot of people from other nearby areas will also specially come wors.h.i.+p here from time to time.\u201dAs they spoke, they entered the temple. Mother Yu reminded, \u201cZhengdu, you have to be sincere when you wors.h.i.+p later.\u201dBefore Yu Zhengdu could respond, he saw a little old man agilely jump off the pedestal being wors.h.i.+pped. He rapidly ran up to Yu Zhengdu and Shang Que, an ingratiating smile on his face. \u201cHow come the two leaders have suddenly arrived? Are you here to perform a work inspection?\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThis person was Fu De True G.o.d, the one who currently had great amounts of incense fire and was being religiously wors.h.i.+pped by Jintan Village and its surrounding occupants. At the same time, he was also a current employee of the Luofeng headquarters. His employee number was 0023, making him even later on the list than Kang Jin.Yu Zhengdu scanned their surroundings. The mortal eye wasn\u2019t capable of seeing G.o.ds or spirits. The wors.h.i.+ppers were carrying on as usual. n.o.body had noticed that the Village G.o.d had already left his pedestal and was reporting on work to his two bosses.Yu Zhengdu couldn\u2019t talk to him right now for fear of arousing other people\u2019s suspicions. He could only glance at the other and softly cough as a signal.The Village G.o.d received his signal and hurriedly made an \u201cok\u201d gesture with his hand. He said, \u201cThen you two leaders can do as you wish. I\u2019ll send you guys an Excel sheet with my work summary on it later.\u201dAfter being unemployed for many years, Fu De True G.o.d had once again been invited back and was receiving incense fire again. He had developed a much greater love and dedication for his job. He worked hard and was diligent, so made pretty great achievements. Each quarter, he could offer quite a lot of faith and burial offerings to Luofeng. Additionally, he was very motivated. Even at such an old age, he had still attended the company\u2019s training cla.s.ses and learned how to use Microsoft Office. He was an excellent employee.Though he could receive Fu De True G.o.d\u2019s work report every quarter, personally seeing one of their company\u2019s workers being wors.h.i.+pped by villagers still gave Yu Zhengdu an exceptionally strong feeling that something was off.Just, everything was very strange.After speaking, Fu De True G.o.d was just about to return to his pedestal when he saw Mother Yu saying to a goose off to the side, \u201cPeppa, you come wors.h.i.+p too. Ask the Village G.o.d to ensure that you\u2019ll become smarter and prettier.\u201dPeppa lifted her goose head and gazed at Fu De True G.o.d with her beady little eyes. Then, she flapped her wings. \u201cGa\u2014\u2014\u201dFu De True G.o.d\u2019s expression turned horrified. \u201cThis can\u2019t be our company\u2019s Peppa Goose, right?!\u201dYu Zhengdu dryly made a sound of acknowledgment.Fu De True G.o.d instantly shot up. \u201cYoung Miss, please don\u2019t wors.h.i.+p me. I\u2019m not worthy of accepting your wors.h.i.+p!!!!\u201dShang Que side-eyed him from off to the side. \u201cGive Young Miss a red envelope, then.\u201dPeppa: \u201cGa ga\u2014\u2014\u201dYu Zhengdu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u2026\u2026<b>The author has something to say:</b>Fu De True G.o.d: Pulls out a red envelope.Xiao Kui: Peppa, share with dad!Peppa: Ga\u2014\u2014 (okay)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
