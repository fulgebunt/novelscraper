I poured a third of my life into this game. It had already become a part of my daily life.However, such a game eventually announced the end of service.It\u2019s not that there weren\u2019t signs. And to be honest, there was nothing strange about ending it. But I couldn\u2019t help but feel empty and betrayed.I moved my characters to visit the warehouse. It displayed the stored items on the screen. It also showed the inventory.Many items accumulated while playing for nearly 10 years.There were ordinary items, great items, and then there were the treasures that were even hard to find in the game. Looking back, I had too many of them.I didn\u2019t stop there and opened the character information window and the skill window.[Lv. 99]RaSa\u2019s level system made it exponentially more difficult to level up as the level increased.Starting from level 80, it not only needed experience points but also many difficult achievements.At level 99, it was the unofficial maximum level of RaSa. No user had reached it yet. But not it had only become a \u2018one level of regret\u2019 for me.I wanted to reach level 100.Sky-piercing stats, all kinds of skills, and even the most gorgeous equipments were lined up on the screen.It was a splendid character specification that even experienced users did not have. But now, it was all useless.Why did I spend all that time to collect and strengthen these scraps of data?\u201cShall we start?\u201dI\u00a0moved the mouse, feeling the anticipation welling up.It was for my last curiosity that I put all these things on the screen.The place where the mouse cursor was directed was at the box-shaped item stuck in a corner of the warehouse.[Box of Chaos].A box of chaos that could fuse everything in the world. Items, gold, skills, stats, whatever the character owned could be set as materials.[Rating: 9 Stars]Compared to other RPG, RaSa had a lot of freedom.So, there were a lot of things like hidden pieces from all over the world. And this \u2018Box of Chaos\u2019 was also an item I got from a dungeon I found by chance.As you could see from the description, the effect was very interesting.There was nothing special about simple item synthesis. But in this box of chaos, not only items but also character skills and stats could be synthesized.In short, there were no restrictions on the type or number of materials that could be set.Except for novelty, it\u2019s an item that doesn't really have much value.However, the only time I used this item since I got it was when I wanted to use it for fun. It\u2019s the reason there were few nine-star items in my warehouse.The efficiency was simply too low.Usually, when something was synthesized, something of a higher value would come out.However, in my case, the value did not improve but decreased.What\u2019s the use of this item when that would usually happen 9 out of 10 times when fusion was attempted?Of course, it was nice to experiment with since you could use anything as a material and you would never know what would come out. But it\u2019s just not worth it.Until now.Where else could there be an item as great as this to decorate the end?[Set the materials for fusion.]I activated the box of chaos and moved the cursor.I clicked on items, gold, stats, skills, everything one by one.I set the items it took me a lot of effort to get and the skills I had gained through luck as materials without hesitation.Only then would the fusion be complete and the character would return to the first level. But so what? It\u2019s the last time, anyway.If I synthesize everything without leaving a single thing, what will come out?[Material settings have been completed.][Do you really want to fuse?]Soon, the preparations were over.I clicked \u2018yes\u2019 without hesitation and, at the same time, felt regretful.I thought I had selected all of them, but I did not set one skill as a material.[Soul of the King.]The spirit of the supreme emperor is imbued with it and is unshakable under any circumstances. Fully immune to all mental debuffs.Every word and action imbued with the dignity and coercion of a rule. Significantly increased the chance of gaining an upper hand in conversation with NPCs.Rating: 9 Stars.Type: Passive.Level: 1 (MAX)RaSa\u2019s unofficial highest grade, 9-star skills or items were extremely rare and their effects were fraudulent.\u2018Soul of the King\u2019 was also one of those 9-star skills.[Convergence begins.]Oh, it\u2019s starting.It was regretful to leave out one, but it didn\u2019t matter, anyway.I stared at the box of chaos vibrating violently on the screen, emitting a dark aura.Why does the effect seems much chaotic than before?A few seconds later, a brilliant light burst through the darkness that enveloped the box, and a notification popped up.[Fusion complete.][Instant Kill (skill acquired)][Instant Kill]Instantly kills the target, ignoring all effects. It can be activated while in contact with the target, and there is no limit to the number of targets.Rating: 10 Stars.Type: ActiveLevel: 1 (MAX)Cooldown: NoneI blinked and looked at the skill that appeared because of the fusion.And soon, I let out a low, astonished sigh.\u201cWow, fuck.\u201dWhat was this?The rating was not 9-stars but 10-stars?The existence of a 10-star rating in RaSa was a fact that had never been revealed.To be honest, I had no expectations. But the outcome was completely beyond my imagination.I was even more shocked reading the skill description.Instant death ignoring all kinds of effects? And there\u2019s no cooldown or target limit?An instant kill with no target limit. Did that mean that I could use it not only on normal mobs but also on boss mobs?Even the heinous bosses who could only be caught after struggling for a few hours could also be subjected to instant kill?It can\u2019t be... no, but its rating has never been seen before, isn\u2019t it?I moved the character with an absurd expression on my face.I should probably just check it out for myself.I never thought that I would actually gain such an outrageous skill with one day left before the game ran out of service.If I had known it would be like this, I would have done this sooner.Woooo!\u201c....?\u201dFor a moment, my vision shook, and the world suddenly sank into darkness.I screamed in surprise, but I couldn\u2019t hear my voice. My body didn\u2019t even move.Amid the strange sound that pierced my ears and the dizziness that seemed to turn the world upside down...[Don\u2019t give up.]Conciousness slowly faded.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Musty smell of dust.I blinked my eyes and lifted my drooping head.\u201cAh~ When can I have a sip of alcohol?\u201dRight next to me, I saw a bald man muttering something with a stern expression.Around us, people in similar clothing were crouching down in rows.It took me a few seconds to realize that it was a prison uniform, and that this was a prison.Thick chains were tied to each of their wrists and ankles. I could even see the densely strewn iron bars in front.Besides, what was that semi-transparent blue curtain swaying beyond the bars? It seemed to come out of any fantasy... Wait- what was that?Other than that, the clothes I was wearing were no different.I blankly looked down at the heavy iron chains on my limbs.What the heck...?I couldn\u2019t understand the situation at all, so I searched for my memory.I must have just been sitting in front of my computer playing RaSa.Why I fused materials in the box of chaos, an amazing 10-star skill came out, and then... Ah, yes. My vision suddenly went dark. Did I faint?And when I opened my eyes again, it was already like this.The memories before this happened were clear. But the current situation was not. Rather, it got more confusing.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d The bald man next to me met my eyes and growled ferociously.\u201cWhere is this?\u201d I asked him.The cool voice that came out naturally when I spoke surprised me.\u201cWhat? What is this crazy bastard saying?\u201dI stared at the man, who was swearing with an absurd expression on his face.Then, he seemed to flinch, but soon replied with a reluctant expression.\u201cWhere is it, inside a fucking convoy?\u201d\u201cA convoy?\u201d\u201cDid you doze off? We\u2019re on our way to Archemon. That damned place, the prisoners\u2019 grave!\u201dArchemon? Prisoners\u2019 grave?As soon as I recalled it had a somewhat familiar name, I almost reflexively asked, \u2018what?\u2019.That\u2019s right, because it was the name of a place that existed not in reality but in a virtual world.In the game world that I knew too well.\u201cHey.\u201d\u201cWhat else?\u201d\u201cAre you sure Archemon is referring to the prison camp managed by Lognar Kingdom?\u201d\u201cWhy do you keep asking the obvious?\u201d\u201cThis place, it\u2019s not called \u2018Earth\u2019, but the continent of Rachronia, correct?\u201dThe man now looked at me like I was a complete madman.\u201cCrazy... why did this guy suddenly change?\u201dThe man who muttered so quietly moved away to the side.I also shut my mouth and just remained silent.It was because I felt like I finally understood what was what without asking further questions.Including the numbers right above the heads of the prisoners, including the man next to him, that slowly appeared in his field of vision.[Lv. 48][Lv. 51][Lv. 45]Level display.It was hard to believe, but it seemed like I had entered the world of Rachronia Saga. There was no other way to explain the current situation.The vivid sensations were clearly letting me know that the present situation was not a dream.Besides... this isn\u2019t even my real body, is it?It would have been nice if there\u2019s a mirror. But even without looking at my face, I could tell that this wasn\u2019t my body.The color of the skin, the voice, the body shape, everything was different. The body itself felt different from usual.Possession? Did I possess a character in a game? How could this nonsense happen?\u201c...\u201dI quickly settled the confusion in my mind and sorted out the situation of this body first.It wasn\u2019t difficult because I got enough information from the short conversation I just had.The convoy, and the Archemon camp.As the bald man said, the place did not differ from a prisoner's grave.It was a place I knew well because it was one of the many processes that I went through while progressing through the main story.A place where you can\u2019t even dream of being released or of escape, living your life in harsh labor and being experimented by, and then dying with all your blood sucked dry.Apparently, I possessed one prisoner being escorted to that rough area.Why did I enter this body? More than that, who, and for what purpose, put me in such a dog-like situation?If you think about it, it\u2019s something that couldn\u2019t be easily figured out.More than that, I had to do something first for my immediate survival problem.At that moment, I suddenly realized the weird gap in my mentality.Why am I so calm?I suddenly entered a game and became a prisoner who was about to be taken to a concentration camp. Wasn\u2019t this a situation where it wouldn\u2019t be strange if I lose conciousness and started panicking? Usually, that would be the case.But I was thinking of quickly sorting things out and solving the immediate crisis.The agitation was only for a moment. What I felt right now was not fear or worry, but only a little confusion and doubt.I used to think that I belonged to the rational side, but... was I the situation who could be remain calm in such an absurd situation?Kwaaang!Then, suddenly, a heavy explosion sounded.The space shook from the explosions that sounded one after another without seemingly no end. What else was happening this time?Embarrassed prisoners muttered and raised their bodies that had fallen to the floor.\u201cFuck, what\u2019s that? What\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cLooks like something exploded upstairs.\u201dWhile the vibration of the hull continued for a long time, the prisoner\u2019 eyes all at once turned towards the bars. All with eyes like surprised rabbits.It was because the blue curtain that surrounded the outside of the prison was slowly losing its light and becoming blurry.Eventually, as the curtain completely disappeared, someone shouted.\u201cThe barrier is gone!\u201dAs if that cry had been a signal, crunches echoed everywhere.It was the sound of prisoners breaking the restraints tied to their hands and feet.\u201cHahaha! What the heck is this? The mana has really returned!\u201d\u201cFreedom! Let\u2019s overturn everything!\u201dThe prisoners who found their freedom in an instant ran amok with joy.I stared blankly at the unprecedented mess happening in front of me. They were like monsters beyond common sense.As if those iron bars were papers.Soon the prisoners who had torn off the iron bars came out one by one.Even then, I still had no choice but to sit alone and stare at what they\u2019re doing in dismay.With the sound of explosion and the rocking boat, I knew the situation was taking an unusual turn. But I had no option to escape.Shit.I cursed inwardly as I looked down at the restraints that wouldn\u2019t budge, no matter how hard I tried.The muscle strength of this body seemed to be at a normal level, not much different from my original body.So, it\u2019s only natural that I couldn\u2019t break it, unlike the other prisoners.At that moment, another explosion erupted. It was very close this time.One prisoner who was first to come out suddenly went flying like a cannonball and crashed into the wall.The other prisoners\u2019 eyes widened at the sight of that prisoner dying instantly with a huge hole in his chest. His shape was so distorted that it was hard to even recognize him.\u201cThese bugs are jumping around excitedly. Where are you planning to crawl out?\u201dIt was an old man with gray hair who entered and said that in a ghastly voice.An old man who exuded a sense of intimidation like a mountain. He looked gigantic that all the rugged prisoners looked like children.\u201cStop him...!\u201dSome prisoners who were unaware and tried to pounce ended up in a situation no different from the prisoner who had crashed into the wall earlier.As if to drive away flies, the old man\u2019s fist turned to those who tried to attack him into a piece of minced meat.He didn\u2019t stop there and started slaughtering all the remaining prisoners.Speed and destructive power far beyond humans.I couldn\u2019t follow his movements with my eyes. All I could see was the sight of prisoners\u2019 bodies bursting out one after another, which turned into fountains of red blood.It was a sight that seemed infinitely unreal. Could it be that the human body could shatter so easily, like bursting a fruit?Kwaaang!In the meantime, a guy flew to where I was sitting and crashed into me. Blood splattered on my face.He literally wiped the prisoners out in the blink of an eye, unable to resist or flee.In fact, from the moment the old man appeared, it was easy to guess the result. Because...[Lv. 91]I could tell from the level displayed above his head.He was a monster in a different level from others.At most, no matter how many level 40 or 50 prisoners flocked to him, they could never touch the old man.As with all RPGs, especially in RaSa, the larger the level gap, the harder it was to establish an equal battle. The number of prisoners was meaningless. Not to mention the vast difference in levels.Fuck.A terrible sight, a thick bloody smell.Wiping the blood from my cheeks, I once again cursed inwardly.I entered the game out of nowhere, became a prisoner of a convoy, something exploded and then shit happened, and the monster old man suddenly appeared and massacred the other prisoners.So much had happened in a short amount of time.The only thing that was certain was that my life was now in greater danger than hanging from a rotten rope on a cliff.\u201cHuh, is there still someone left?\u201dThe old man looked my way curiously, brushed off the blood soaked in his fist and walked closer.He climbed over the broken bars and entered the prison, looking down at me. I also looked up at him without speaking.In fact, it was just that I couldn\u2019t get out of the restraints. But since I didn\u2019t run away and stayed calm, I had a tiny expectation that he would somehow save me.But it seemed like a futile hope.A cruel smile crept across the old man\u2019s lips.\u201cA guy with strange eyes. Such a waste that you have to be killed here.\u201dHe suddenly placed a huge hand on top of my head.Even though it was just him placing a hand on my head, I felt the pressure as if my head would collapse at any moment.If the old man put even a little of strength in his grip, my head would explode. And that was the future that would happen soon.Am I going to die in vain like this?Even amid this, my head was still calmly assessing the situation.Maybe if I die like this, I can go back to my original world?It was not without possibility. However, I couldn\u2019t just throw away my current life as easily as a game.\u201c...!\u201dIn an instant, while desperately searching for a way out, I remembered something.Last minute before entering the game.The\u00a0box of chaos, a skill that popped out because of merging everything that my character possessed.[Instant Kill]Instantly kills the target, ignoring all effects. I can activate it while in contact with the target, and there is no limit to the number of targets.No way. That thought crossed my mind.Because I entered this game right after the fusion ended.There was no certainty. However, now it was a desperate situation where I had to grab at least a straw.\u201cI am Hanson Garten. If you have any last words, I will listen to it.\u201dI met the old man\u2019s eyes and opened my mouth.\u201cDie.\u201dThe hand that had been placed on his head slipped away.The old man\u2019s huge body collapsed on the floor like a doll with its strings cut off.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At least that\u2019s what I wanted to believe.If not, what else could be the reason for this monster to suddenly collapse?I was now convinced that I possessed this body while retaining the instant kill skill that came out of the fusion.Then what other skills do I have besides that instant kill?My thoughts naturally flowed in that direction.Even in RaSa, I was one of the high level players which could be counted in one hand.If I maintained the other skills that my character had as they were... I would have danced happily right about now. But it wasn\u2019t the case.Among the skills that I possessed, there were many passive skills that amplified the character\u2019s basic stats. So, if the skills were maintained, it wouldn\u2019t make sense for this body to be so weak now.Even if I tried to use some of the active skills, none of them seemed to be usable.There are no other skills, so why only instant kill? Ah...I quickly realized the reason.Why? Because all other skills and stats were used as fusion materials.If the game character\u2019s abilities were transferred based on the point at which I completed fusion, then everything made sense.This extremely weak physical ability, and that no skills other than instant kill existed... I sighed.Could it really be like that? Really?For a moment, I felt a chill behind my back.Then, if there was no fusion, could it have been possible for my game character\u2019s abilities to have been maintained?No, the current situation itself might not have occurred if that fusion never happened.I possessed someone in the game right after I fused all of my game character\u2019s abilities and items. The correlation between the two was a bit of a reach. But it\u2019s the most plausible answer.Either way, I shouldn\u2019t have done that damn fusion at all.Regrets wouldn\u2019t help.I calmed down the rage that was about to boil inside me and tried to regain my composure in an instant....Ah, was it like that?Then I suddenly realized the reason I could maintain this nonsense composure without the slightest agitation.[Soul of the King]It imbued the supreme status of a king in the soul and was unshakable under any circumstance. Fully immune to all mental debuffs.Every word and action imbued with dignity and coercion of a ruler. Significantly increased the chance of gaining an upper hand in conversations with NPCs.A\u00a09-star skill that I accidentally left out during fusion - the [Soul of the Emperor].I wondered if its effects were affecting my psyche.Thanks to this, it must be possible to continue maintaining composure even in this crazy situation, even in this chaos where I almost died, and the surroundings had become a sea of blood with pieces of corpses all around.It would be truly be impossible if it was me before.I moved my gaze again to the old man who had become a cold corpse.By the way, did he say \u2018the warrior Garten\u2019?One of the five stars of Santea, a person who could rank among the continental-class powerhouses in the worldview of RaSa, it referred to the label \u2018warrior\u2019.I know the name \u2018warrior\u2019 very well. But the name \u2018Garten\u2019 was unfamiliar.The warrior that appeared while I was playing RaSa was not Garten but someone different.I\u2019m sure I didn\u2019t remember it wrong... could it be a different timeline?Also, I was not sure why someone of such a status was aboard Archemon\u2019s convoy.No, I should put aside those things for now.What should I do from now on then?It\u2019s good that my life was saved right away, but there\u2019s still a crising at hand.My hands and feet were still bound in restraints. And although the sound of the explosion had stopped, the ship\u2019s unsteady shaking seemed to get worse.I was not sure what the heck was going on with this convoy. But if I continued to be tied up like this, there\u2019s a high possibility that my survival would be threatened again.\u201c...?\u201dAt that moment, my gaze turned to one side.It wasn\u2019t conscious; it was more like a reflex.It\u2019s because something strange caught my eye in the corner of my field of vision - just beyond the bars.[Lv. 89]A level indicator floating on an empty space.After thinking of the possibility of what was happening, I concluded quickly, with little difficulty.Stealth-type skill...There\u2019s no way a level indicator would float there when there\u2019s no one standing in that area.It meant that someone invisible was there.I was not sure how long this person had been hiding, but that wasn\u2019t the important part.The level was not as high as the previous one, but it\u2019s still a monster with almost the same level.I had to make the right decision about how I would act in front of that unknown opponent.But before that, my mouth had already opened reflexively and spoke against my better judgment.And in a very arrogant and careless tone, too.\u201cStop acting like a rat and come out.\u201d...Did I suddenly go crazy and was secretly wishing to die?I didn\u2019t know why those words suddenly popped up. Something like mere instinct overtook reason for a moment. I immediately realized where it was coming from.Was there anything than the [Soul of the King] that could have a sudden impact on my current personality?Fuck.Whatever it was, it completely screwed me over.Even if there\u2019s an instant kill skill, it couldn\u2019t be activated unless I was in contact with the target.If that unknown opponent, angry at my provocation, launched an attack, my life would end just like that.But fortunately, no such disaster occurred.Squek.After a while, darkness filled the air, and a man in a robe appeared.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was unreasonable to deal with someone as strong as that alone, even if it was Dayphon.But he wasn\u2019t too concerned. Because there was a card prepared for such a variable.Is it over there?The strong energy felt from downstairs made Dayphon immediately convinced that the warrior was there.The inside of the cabin, which appeared to be the prisoner\u2019 confinement spaces, was already a gruesome scene with the bodies of the prisoners.It was difficult to control even the rampaging prisoners when the convoy was attacked, so the person responsible for this must have dealt with them all.Moving leisurely inside the cabin while hiding, he could find the warrior Garten as expected.\u201cI am the warrior, Garten. If you have any last words, I will listen to it.\u201dThe warrior had his hand on top of a prisoner\u2019s head.Dayphon stood at a distance and watched the scene.He didn\u2019t know the full situation, but the warrior was planning to deal with the last surviving prisoner after he listened to his will.I have to attack the moment he kills that prisoner.If possible, it would be better to launch a surprise attack at the most appropriate time.After deciding, Dayphon waited for the warrior to explode the prisoner\u2019s head.And soon, the prisoner\u2019s mouth opened.\u201cDie.\u201dDayphon\u2019s eyes widened in astonishment at the sight that followed.\u201c...?!\u201dThe warrior\u2019s body collapsed on the floor at the prisoner\u2019s words.For a moment, he did not know what had happened.Dead...?No breathing, no heart beating.The sign of life was completely cut off from the fallen warrior, and Dayphon could no longer feel any energy from him.He\u2019s really dead.In an instant, one of the Five Stars of Santea, a warrior with a high reputation throughout the continent, died just like that.Dayphon reflexively stopped breathing and killed his presence as much as possible.A prisoner with restraints on his hands and feet, staring down at the dead warrior.It was hard to believe, but it was a sight that made one think he had killed the warrior, Garten.But how?The other didn\u2019t lift a finger. All the mad did was say a short word - \u2018die\u2019....Spirit magic? Is it some kind of spirit?However, how could there be a spirit capable if killing the warrior with just one word? What kind of spirit was that?Dayphon stared at the man with confusion.The appearance of a variable that was far beyond the assumption. He couldn\u2019t really decide what to do in this absurd situation.Surprise attack? Doing that would be crazy, especially since he\u2019s up against a monster who killed the warrior in just an instant.Even with the power provided by the King of the Dead, the original plan to kill the warrior, the odds of winning were unknown.So, should I retreat like this? But to return without knowing the identity of that unknown person...\u201c...!\u201dFor a moment, Dayphon felt goosebumps welling up all over his body.It was because the man suddenly turned his gaze and was staring at where he was.\u201cStop acting like a rat and come out.\u201d...Caught. Since when?That his stealth skill was so easily discovered made Dayphon feel the greatest shock and disappointment.It was because he had the highest stealth ability on all continents.He was still thinking of escaping just now, but he soon gave up on that idea.His life could easily end in an instant, just like what happened to the warrior just now. He couldn\u2019t risk that.Squeak.Dayphon appeared and met the man\u2019s eyes.In the empty eyes that did not show any emotion, he felt an indescribable sense of coercion.Dayphon only had a vague intuition.That the man in front of him might be someone on par with the monarchs.\u201c...Who are you?\u201dAfter a moment of silence, Dayphon asked.The man just stared at him with his mouth still closed, as if he had no intention of answering.Unspoken pressure. Dayphon guessed the meaning of that gaze and thought about what to say.The other\u2019s identity was unknown, but he was escorted to Archemon as a prisoner and he killed the warrior without hesitation.At least there was no friendly relationship there, so it wouldn\u2019t matter if Dayphon revealed his identity. No, it would be better to make it clear.\u201cI am a member of the Calderic Monarchy, Dayphon. Not affiliated with the Rognar Kingdom or Santea Empire Alliance.\u201dAt those words, a slight change occurred in the man's expression. He wasn\u2019t sure what the other was thinking.\u201c...Calderic Monarchy?\u201dAfter mumbling like that, he paused and asked;\u201cWhat did you do to this ship?\u201d\u201c...If you want to know the condition of the hull, the convoy will soon sink without reaching Archemon.\u201dAt those words, the man\u2019s expression slightly frowned for a moment and then straightened again.The conversation ended like that.As if that was all he was curious about, the man asked nothing else.He seemed uninterested in why Calderic attacked a single convoy or the details behind it.For now, is it fortunate that that\u2019s the case?Dayphon was a little relieved at the other\u2019s attitude that didn\u2019t show any hostility.No, rather than having no hostility... it seemed closer to not being interested anymore since Dayphon had already answered his question.As long as Dayphon didn\u2019t attack, the man didn\u2019t seem to care anymore whether he escaped.However, Dayphon hesitated to leave.It\u2019s because he felt regretful about leaving just like this.He, too, was in a state of growing doubts and curiosity about this bizarre man.\u201cWhy is someone like you a prisoner in this convoy?\u201dA monster that killed the warrior in an instant and discovered him, whose ability and power were unfathomable.To Dayphon, the situation seemed ridiculous. Like finding a dragon sleeping quietly curled up with meager shackled at the corner of a goblin cage.Cooong!The hull shook violently and tilted.The man still did not take any action, and the answer to the question was not returned.Dayphon, who was staring at him, suddenly realized something.\u201c...\u201dEmpty eyes with cold emotions. Total indifference to the surroundings. A uniquely bored atmosphere.He had seen a similar person.That was clearly the attitude of someone who no longer felt any meaning in life.Perhaps everything was irrelevant to that man.Even now, even when the ship was sinking, the other did not even think of escaping. Whether he died, his life would not matter.Killing the warrior and talking to Dayphon must have been just a momentary whim.Waa!Once again, the hull vibrated.Dayphon felt a great disappointment.A giant like this no longer had any interest or regret in the world and wanted to just sink to the cold seabed and disappear.The regret made him come up with a rather impulsive, out-of-the-box proposal that didn\u2019t suit the situation at all.\u201cWould you like to go with me?\u201dHe just hoped that he could ignite even the slightest spark of interest in this man\u2019s heart.\u201cTo Calderic\u2019s overlord castle?\u201dTranslator's Note : Yup, there will be more of this misunderstanding later.\u00a0^^Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If that was the case, the reaction was understandable.If it wasn\u2019t like that, what else could be the reason a strong person comparable to the warrior be wary of a prisoner chained like this?Anyway, for me right now, this illusion was something I was truly grateful for. So, I tried to keep my expression as expressionless as possible to match the rhythm.The other had been asking who I was, but since I wasn\u2019t sure how to answer, it\u2019s better to just shut up.If I showed any emotional agitation for no reason, it would put me in a more disadvantageous position.\u201cI am a member of the Calderic Monarchy, Dayphon. Not affiliated with the Rognar Kingdom or Santea Empire Alliance.\u201dThe man introduced himself first.\u201c\u2026Calderic Monarchy?\u201dBut what was Calderic?It\u2019s one of the four major powers in RaSa, which divided the continent along with Santea.Could this guy be responsible for the current situation?Besides the warrior, even Calderic. What the hell were these people doing gathering in this one convoy?I was just guessing, but some unusual power struggle must be involved.More than that, the important thing to me right now was not their purpose or background, but my immediate survival.I glanced at the other and asked;\u201cWhat did you do to the ship?\u201dThe shaking hadn\u2019t stopped since a while ago. But It\u2019s not like it\u2019s sinking or anything like that\u2026\u201cIf you want to know the condition of the hull, the convoy will soon sink without reaching Archemon.\u201dHmm\u2026?Unknowingly, my poker face broke in an instant.I would be soon be sentenced to drown in the middle of the sea, so I couldn\u2019t help but frown.\u201cWhy is someone like you a prisoner in a convoy?\u201dI also wanted to grab the guy who threw me into this game and ask him, so please shut up.What now?Hands and feet were still tied. And in the meantime, the ship was said to be sinking soon. In addition, a monster close to level 90 was standing in front of me.Far from improving, the situation was only getting worse.Even if I kept my cool, was there any way to survive this situation?Cooong!The hull, which shook more violently, warned that time was running out.But why is that guy so relaxed?No matter how high the level was, could you escape the middle of the sea with your bare body?But hey, he\u2019s the one responsible for this, so there must be an escape route.Whether if there\u2019s another ship prepared or teleporting\u2026 Ah.I realized that I had gone crazy thinking that far.That there was only one lifeline to lean on in this situation.If I can get help from this person\u2026If so, wouldn\u2019t it be possible to at least avoid being buried with this ship?But the obvious problem was\u2026There\u2019s no way he\u2019ll help me.What reason did he have to do that?There\u2019s clearly a \u2018boundary\u2019 between us.Since he didn\u2019t know my strength, it must have been that he was taking a cautious attitude and not recklessly attacking.In such a situation, could I really ask for help?In fact, there was a much higher chance that my neck would be blown off immediately after he discovered I was nothing more than an insignificant piece of trash.However, he was my only way out.If I wanted to prolong my life, I had to think of a way.Whether it\u2019s using the delusion he\u2019s harboring for me or whatever, he had to find a way to escape somehow\u2026\u201cWould you like to go with me? To Calderic\u2019s overlord\u2019s castle?\u201d\u2026What?I looked at him, hiding my dumbfounded expression.\u201cThe Overlord is someone who values ability above else. Race, origin, and your past don\u2019t matter in Calderic. A man like Sir is sure to be welcomed by the Overlord.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cCalderic differs from Santea in many things. At least there are many things that will interest you more than a land only for humans.\u201dEven the title had changed to \u2018Sir\u2019.But what was he saying now?It was unexpected, so it took me a while to understand.\u2026Was he scouting me?Was that guy now proposing to recruit me to his faction?No matter how much he overestimated my existence, but, seriously, to a prisoner whose identity was unknown?More than I thought, I realized he was deeply mistaken about something.Of course, this was a great opportunity.The situation where he offered to take me out here without me desperately putting on a show.If I accepted the offer, I could escape safely from this sinking ship. But\u2026The problem is what will happen after that.In reality, I was just a scumbag with no special abilities. So, what was I going to do once I reached Calderic?And what? Overlord Castle? He\u2019s going to take me directly to the Overlord of Calderic?I\u2019d rather stick my head through the tiger\u2019s jaws.\u2026But there was no other way.Whether it\u2019s being crushed by the wreckage of a collapsing ship or drowning in the sea, if I didn\u2019t accept this offer, I would surely die on the spot.Right now, my priority was to live. I\u2019d just think of the aftermath later.After a long silence, I quietly opened my mouth.\u201cIs this a recruitment offer?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dA quick answer came back.\u201cIt\u2019s Calderic\u2026\u201d I muttered that and then continued, \u201cIt\u2019s a little interesting.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That\u2019s probably a bit too much.I immediately regretted what I said. What did I mean by \u2018interesting\u2019? I probably went too far to create an atmosphere. It would have been okay to just nod and accept the other\u2019s offer.Still, I was safe since Dayphon\u2019s face seemed to brighten up a little for an instant.Fortunately, my earnestness seemed to have been conveyed, and he walked into the prison.Kang!An unknown intangible force easily smashed the restraints, and it scattered on the floor.Only then could I regain my freedom.When I glanced at him, he didn\u2019t look like he found anything strange.Yeah, could you imagine that the guy who killed the warrior was a weakling who couldn\u2019t even break a single piece of metal?\u201cI formally greet you again. I am Dayphon Cladinel, Chief of Staff of the Overlord, belonging to the Overlord Castle of the Calderic Monarchy.\u201dOverlord\u2019s direct chief of staff?Somehow, the identity is amazingly high.Only then did I know his true identity.I didn\u2019t memorize all the names of the many NPCs in RaSa, so I couldn\u2019t immediately recall the names when I heard them.Chief of staff of the Overlord of Calderic. He was the closest aide to the Overlord, and his actual influence was as great as that of the Nine Lords.After he finished speaking, he stared at me.It was a gaze waiting for an answer.I felt uneasy. I didn\u2019t even know who this body belonged to, so how could I introduce myself?After a moment of silence, I finally uttered a short word.\u201cRon.\u201dThere was no meaning behind it. Just a name that came to my mind randomly in an instant.Because I couldn\u2019t even say my real name\u2014Seok Ja\u2014in a Western-style fantasy world.Fortunately, Dayphon nodded without asking further.\u201cOh, and excuse me, but can I have the warrior\u2019s corpse?\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s probably someone else who might want this. Ownership of the body, of course, belongs to Sir Ron.\u201dNo, I don\u2019t need any of that.What did he mean by having ownership over a dead body? Who would want this?Ah, is he talking about the King of the Dead?Anyway, it was a good thing for me, so I replied he could take care of it in whichever way he wanted.After a short thank you, Dayphon waved his hand at the warrior\u2019s corpse.Then, a dark aura rose and in an instant swallowed the corpse without a trace.\u201cThen, Sir Ron, I will take you to the Overlord\u2019s Castle right now. I will teleport you, so please do not resist my magic.\u201dDayphon said and held out his hand.Come to think of it, one of the Chief of Staff\u2019s abilities must have been an ultra-long distance teleport. But wait a minute\u2014\u2026To the Overlord\u2019s castle right now?I stared at his outstretched hand with a trembling heart, then grabbed it and stood up.Ugh.Soon, the surrounding space slowly distorted with a soft blue light, and for an instant, I felt a sensation as if my body was floating.\u2026Felt like vomiting. How much time had passed? Had 10 seconds passed?When my vision became clear again, I was no longer in the prison of a convoy.I blinked my eyes, hiding my surprise at the scenery that changed in an instant.A dark and spacious communal space.On the walls in all directions, there were countless huge stones that glowed in blue, and the light emitted from them gathered right under the feet to form a geometric figure.\u2026Magic circle?I looked down at it slowly disappearing, then raised my head and looked around.Aside from the magic circle, the monsters in robes stood motionless like stone statues around them.It\u2019s like an atmosphere that something would happen if one tried to even move.\u201cSir Dayphon.\u201dA woman dressed to look like a butler came closer and bowed her head.\u201cThank you for your hard work. I\u2019m glad you returned safely.Naturally, my eyes went to her pointy ears. An elf?\u201cWhat about the Overlord?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s in her seat. The meeting of the monarchs will begin in a little while.\u201d\u201cWe came back at a very opportune time.\u201dAfter muttering that, Dayphon continued talking to the woman who glanced at me with a questioning gaze.\u201cThis is a nobleman I will introduce to the Overlord directly. Let\u2019s do our best to serve him.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dThose words obviously took her aback, but soon quickly returned to her expressionless expression.Then, with one arm folded, she bowed with the utmost respect.\u201cI have committed disrespect. My name is Caren.\u201d\u2026It seemed like things were moving in the right direction.Even after escaping the convoy, the situation was still frantic.So\u2026 this is the Calderic\u2019s Overlord\u2019s castle, right?Did they really travel that long distance from the realm of Santea to Calderic in one go?And from now on, would I have to face the Overlord of Calderic?Of course, I somehow had already expected that, but\u2026 straight away?I wondered what kind of reaction would Dayphon have if I changed my words and told him I would reject his offer?Unlike the convoy from earlier, this was Dayphon\u2019s main base and the very center of Calderic\u2019s forces.Was it too optimistic to expect someone to let go of me with a smile on their face?\u201cWelcome to Calderic\u2019s Overlord Castle, Lord Ron.\u201dDayphon, who had no way of knowing how I was feeling, said that and I could only sigh.The price of escaping a sinking ship was entering the tiger\u2019s den.The Overlord of Calderic, Rashtain.In addition, even in RaSa\u2019s worldview, one of the most powerful leader.Ah, now I really didn\u2019t know what to do.Whatever happens, happens, I guess?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Caren guided me and I followed her.\u201cIf Sir Ron needs a meal, a bath, or anything else, just tell me. I\u2019ll get things ready right away.\u201dI replied I would take a bath first.My appearance was filthy because I had been a prisoner just a while ago.As if Caren had already expected that answer, she immediately ordered the servants to prepare.The maids tried to help me bathe, but I told them all to go away.It\u2019s embarrassing to let someone else wash my body when I was just an ordinary modern person less than an hour ago.\u201cI will prepare a separate meal while you\u2019re taking a bath\u2026\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201dI just wanted to wash and clean up. I didn\u2019t really think of eating.After somehow taking a bath, I changed into clean clothes and was escorted to my room. It was a very spacious and colorful room.I walked in and stood in front of the mirror.On the other side of the mirror, a very unfamiliar man was staring at me.Jet-black hair, pale skin, two bright golden eyes, and distinct features.How disgustingly handsome.Putting aside the current situation, this was just a pure appreciation of the body I possessed.I had already checked it while taking a bath, but it was a face I would never get used to.More than that, this was not the avatar of my game character, which had blonde hair and blue eyes.I moved, and this time stood by the window.Since it was a room on a high floor, I could see the scenery of the castle well from the window.The gigantic walls surrounding the outskirts, the tall and majestic buildings, and the soldiers and knights standing guard everywhere with a formidable spirit.The Calderic Monarchy.One of the continent\u2019s four major powers, with the Overlord Rashtain and her nine lords at the peak.Unlike Santea, where almost only humans lived, it was a land where various races other than humans were mixed.As can be seen from such characteristic, it was the most free and open-minded force among the four major powers.The place where I was now was the Overlord Castle of Calderic.The Overlord\u2019s castle was in the very center of Woborn, the capital of Dragore.Dragore was also a familiar area that I used to frequent while playing RaSa.Does the city of Woborn spreads outside the wall?Beyond the computer screen, it\u2019s hard to recognize places in reality that one had only seen through the game graphics.If it had not been for this situation, I would have been able to enjoy the overwhelming scenery in front of me.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dI rested my chin on the windowsill and let out a deep sigh.Really, how did this happen?Why did I have to meet the overlord of Calderic?Even if this all blew up from just one misunderstanding, it simply blew out of proportion.Now, I could even transcend species and understand the mind of a cow being led to a slaughterhouse.Suddenly, what Caren said earlier came to mind.Come to think of it, they said the meeting of the monarchs would start soon\u2026I was one of the very first players of RaSa.Of course, I knew a lot about Calderic.Not only the main NPCs belonging to Calderic, but even the way the ruling class worked and their governing system were still quite detailed in my mind.It was rare for users to play a game, knowing even the detailed settings that had nothing to do with the story progress, but the case was a little different when the game was RaSa.RaSa was a game with a lot of hidden pieces, and sometimes one could find clues about them within the game settings.That\u2019s why it was common for not only me, but for most of the players in RaSa to know the most trivial settings one after another.Monarch meeting.As the name suggested, it was a regular conference attended by the Overlord and all the nine lords.And the place where the meeting was held was, of course, the Overlord Castle, where the Overlord was located.Then, doesn\u2019t that mean that most of the other monarchs are also gathered here?As I thought about it, a feeling of uneasiness welled up.Somehow\u2026 I got the feeling that this timing wasn\u2019t very good.Because from what I knew, the Overlord Rashtain was someone with a rather erratic personality.After being in anguish for a while, a knock rang.\u201cAre you resting, Sir Ron?\u201dIt was Dayphon, not Caren, who opened the door and entered.I knew the time had come.The words that followed proved the ominous premonition I had.\u201cThe meeting of the Overlord and the other monarchs is about to begin. But the Overlord wants Sir Ron to attend it as well.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dOh.The goddamn foresight was proven correct once again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even if just a little.Since it also worked on the warrior, the effect was certain. But there was a fatal condition that I could only activate it upon contact.Well, even if that was the case, there wouldn\u2019t be any other way, anyway.I could use my vast knowledge of the game as a negotiating card with the Overlord. But I doubted if that would even help.Of course, the best thing would be to get through this hurdle somehow without getting caught.The more we walked further, the darker it seemed. Before I knew it, the windows in the hallway had completely disappeared.Instead, glowing stones embedded in the ceiling lit up the darkness.Eventually, as I entered the aisle covered with a dark red carpet, several knights stood solemnly lined up at what seemed to be the entrance.The knights raised their swords and saluted.Dayphon nodded to the knights and walked past them. And I followed, pretending to be calm.After walking for a long time in the long hallway, I slowly saw a huge door at the end.And the figure of someone standing in the front a little further away, as if they had just arrived like us.It was a woman with red hair reminiscent of a blazing fire.The beast\u2019s ears stood on either side of her head. A cut that ran in an oblique line from the forehead to the chin. And the huge sword on the back.\u201cHey, chief of staff.\u201dThe woman who was looking this way spoke in a light tone.Contrary to that, Dayphon bowed his head politely.\u201cFifth Lord.\u201dI knew her true identity from the moment I saw her, even without hearing her title or name.[Lv. 95]With that terrifying level and that appearance, there was only one person who came to mind.The Fifth Lord \u2013 the Lord of Madness, Ignel.Even before entering the meeting room, one of the lords suddenly appeared like this.I looked at her, feeling a little strange.Even though she\u2019s just standing there, her presence seemed to weigh down the entire space.I wasn\u2019t familiar with the \u2018warrior\u2019. Dayphon was a character that was rarely involved in the game, but the Fifth Lord was different.One of the most familiar names among the named boss characters in the game, which I struggled to defeat dozens of times.Once again, I realized the fact that this was a world within the game.\u201cIt would be a big deal if I didn\u2019t arrive on time. But what is that?\u201dThe Mad Lord asked with a chin gesture towards me.\u201cThe Overlord herself is the one who gave permission to let this person attend the meeting.\u201d\u201c\u2026Hoh?\u201dAt that, she put on a puzzled expression.\u201cThe Overlord\u2019s permission, that\u2019s something rare. So, who is it?\u201d\u201cThis time, I accidentally brought them from outside\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, come to think of it, you went to Santea. Where did you find such a guy\u2026hmm?\u201dHer gaze turned back to me.The beast\u2019s pupils, which were torn vertically, scanned my whole body once, and I met a pair of terrifying eyes.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like much.\u201dWaa!An explosive sound shattering the air.Suddenly, her hair fluttered with the gust of wind, and the blade of her sword stopped right in front of my neck.\u201c\u2026\u201dI just stared at her, who was holding a sword, stiff as a stone statue.\u2026What did she do? Did she wield her sword? When?I wasn\u2019t even aware of her pulling the huge sword out of her back.Unreasonable speed, as if it omitted altogether the process of going from point A to point B.\u201cHmm?\u201dThe Mad Lord grinned as she drew her sword back.\u201cNo matter how lifeless it looks, I never thought you wouldn\u2019t react at all. You\u2019re tough compared to your appearance.\u201dIt\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t react, it\u2019s that I couldn\u2019t.I felt like I just went back and forth on the Jordan River just now.If it wasn\u2019t for the emperor\u2019s soul, I would have collapsed already because of how weak my legs became.\u201cFifth Lord.\u201dThankfully, Dayphon stepped forward with a firm voice.\u201cDon\u2019t be too serious. It\u2019s just a light greeting.\u201dGiggling, the Mad Lord retrieved the sword and turned around.\u201cYou, let\u2019s talk together later when the opportunity arises. No matter how I look at it, I can\u2019t feel any magic power. So, I wonder what kind of ability you have.\u201dWhat a terrible suggestion.It seemed that more stacks of misunderstanding had accumulated unintentionally.As I watched her from the back as she continued to walk towards the door, Dayphon bowed his head to me.He seemed to apologize for what had just happened.It would have been nice if he had stepped forward before Ignel swung her sword. Well, let\u2019s just be thankful that my neck was still intact.Cooong!The huge door opened wide with a heavy echo.The Mad Lord opened the door first and went inside the meeting room.All the other lords, aside from her, must have already been inside.\u201cThen, let\u2019s go in.\u201dI entered the meeting room with Dayphon, feeling as if I was walking through the jaws of a monster.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thank you to Melekono for donating! ^^The air was heavy.It was a literal expression, not a metaphor. This was the only way I could describe the atmosphere when I entered the conference room.It was a much larger and slightly darker space than I had imagined.The first thing that came into sight was the huge round table in the center, and the five people sitting around it\u2026 no, beings.\u201cWelcome Fifth Lord and Chief of Staff.\u201dBreaking the silence, an old man\u2019s benevolent voice resounded.It was a voice from a dwarf occupying a seat at the round table.He was short, tanned skin, and had a thick beard that extended under his chin.Above all, his rock-like muscular body was clearly visible, even from a distance.There was only one being that could have all those features\u2014a dwarf.I also knew who he was.The First Lord\u2014the Wiseman, Agor.All the gazes of the Lords of the Round Table, including him, were directed our way.\u201cOh, it\u2019s been a while old Agor.\u201dThe Mad Lord approached one of the empty seats and sat down.Other than that, there was no other greeting.It\u2019s just that the gazes filled with question were still lingering on Dayphon and I.The Third Lord\u2014the Heavenly Palace, the Second Lord\u2014the Thunder Lord, the Sixth Lord, the Tyrant, and the Eight Lord, the Black Sea Empress. I also looked at their faces and matched them with the names in my memory one by one.The lords of Calderic were of completely different races and characteristics, so it was easy to see who was who at a glance.Is the Overlord not here?Hadn\u2019t she reached the conference room yet?Besides the Overlord, the fourth, seventh, and ninth Lords were nowhere to be seen.It was unknown whether they had not yet arrived or were absent altogether.\u201cBy the way, who is the human next to you?\u201dThe First Lord\u2014the Wiseman, asked Dayphon.As he explained to the Mad Lord earlier, Dayphon introduced me again.\u201cThis is an honored guest brought in from the outside. The Overlord permitted him to attend the meeting.\u201dThe reaction of the Lords to those words were varied.\u201cThe Overlord gave\u2026 permission?\u201dThe Wiseman, who asked, muttered in a mixture of doubt and surprise.\u201cHuh? What\u2019s with this situation?\u201dThe Eight Lord, the Black Sea Empress, rested her chin on the table and expressed interest.\u201cAnyway, our Overlord really prepared something good. At least this meeting hasn\u2019t been boring from the start.\u201dThe Tyrant also laughed as if he was having fun.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe Third Lord, the Heavenly Palace, was staring blankly into space as if he was not interested.In the first place, he hadn\u2019t even looked this way from the very beginning.\u201cWhy did the Overlord allow an outsider to attend the Lords\u2019 council?\u201dThe only one who showed negative emotions was the Second Lord, the Thunder Lord.An elf with long, sky-blue hair and long, pointy ears looked at me with blatantly displeased eyes.I also don\u2019t know why I\u2019m here, so don\u2019t look at me like that.Then, the Mad Lord giggled and intervened.\u201cThe Overlord gave permission, simple as that. Why are you acting strict and arguing here, kid?\u201dThe Thunder Lord turned her gaze and glared at her.\u201cI already warned you not to call me \u2018kid\u2019, Fifth Lord.\u201d\u201cDid you do that? What can I say? Something probably blocked my ears.\u201dAt the Mad Lord\u2019s act of pricking up her ears as if teasing, the Thunder Lord only clicked her tongue.I just stood there and watched the scene.As I was thinking about whether I should keep standing like this, Dayphon guided me to my seat.\u201cPlease sit over here.\u201dSo I took a seat at the round table and sat down.Of course, I didn\u2019t return the interest given by the other Lords.Oh, I hate it. This kind of atmosphere.Above all, the Eighth Lord, the Black Sea Empress, who was sitting in the seat in front of me, made me feel quite burdened by just her presence.The moth-like antennae on the forehead, the huge membrane wings on the back, and the appearance of a mixture of human skin and insect exoskeleton were so grotesque that it was hard to look at her.Don\u2019t talk to me, please.Among these monsters, all I could do was keep my eyes on the air and shut up with a blank expression.As I was having such a hard time, the door to the meeting room opened again and someone came in.It was a maid.\u201c\u2026?\u201dNo\u2026 maid?A woman who entered the meeting hall alone bowed her head in greeting, approached the round table, and set down the teacups one by one.Somehow, a more strange atmosphere filled the air.The appearance of an ordinary attendant setting drinks before the start of the meeting shouldn\u2019t be a cause for worry.But I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off her. Or more precisely, to the number above her head.[Lv. 98]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Time is almost up.\u201dThe Black Sea Empress smiled at me and muttered slyly.\u201cShe\u2019ll be here soon. Just wait patiently while we have tea.\u201dContrary to what he said, the Tyrant, who drank the steaming tea at once, licked his lips and asked the Fifth Lord.\u201cBy the way, I heard you went to Brunhel, Fifth Lord. Was there anything interesting you want to share?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t act familiar with me, you vampiric bastard.\u201dHowever, she mercilessly dismissed the question with a different cold voice from before.The Tyrant shrugged his shoulders as if he was already used to such an attitude.\u201cHow cold. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re always impatient with me. Aren\u2019t I likable? Don\u2019t you think so, Second Lord?\u201d\u201cWho would like something vulgar like you? I\u2019ve said it many times, but don\u2019t talk to me unnecessarily.\u201d\u201cYou are all too much. Didn\u2019t we just fight on the same side earlier?\u201dListening to those useless conversations, I fell into trouble.How long did I have to watch this absurd play?Can I test something?Looking at the maid who came to my side one last time and set down the teacup, I opened my mouth and said;\u201cOverlord.\u201dThe maid\u2019s movement froze.\u201cWhen are you going to end this prank?\u201dI continued.The other lords all looked this way with an expression of surprise.Even the Third Lord, the Heavenly Palace, who had never looked at me before.\u201c\u2026Hahaha!\u201dOnly then did the maid, who threw off her mask, took a step back and burst into laughter.\u201cI heard you saw through Dayphon\u2019s stealth at one glance. It\u2019s been a while since a really interesting guest like you came.\u201d\u2026Overlord Rashtain.The master of all Calderic and the head of the Nine Lords.And one of the people closest to the strongest in the worldview of RaSa.Swish.In an instant, a black aura wrapped around her whole body. And in the blink of an eye, it transformed her into a completely different person.Her waist-length jet-black long hair and eyes, and even the clothes she was wearing, changed from a maid\u2019s uniform to a bright dress.After walking to the seat of honor at the round table, she slumped down in her seat, fluttering the hem of her dress.Dayphon, who had been standing near the entrance of the conference hall until just now, moved behind her and stood still.\u201cLet\u2019s see, the Fourth and Ninth Lords are absent because they\u2019re busy with their own business.\u201dThe Overlord\u2019s gaze, which was looking around the round table, turned to the Wiseman.\u201cFirst Lord must have been busy, but you still worked hard and took part today.\u201dAt those words, the Wiseman shook his head gently.\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal, Overlord. It\u2019s my duty as a Lord to attend the Lords\u2019 Council unless it\u2019s unavoidable.\u201dThe Overlord turned her gaze to the Thunder Lord, this time with a faint smile.\u201cSecond Lord, you look like you have a lot to say, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cHow are you, Overlord?\u201dThe Thunder Lord nodded, glanced at me, and continued;\u201cIt\u2019s just hard to fathom the Overlord\u2019s intentions in bringing an outside to the meeting.\u201d\u201cHaha, is the Second Lord asking what I was thinking, doing such a thing?\u201dThe Overlord smiled and waved her hand.\u201cSince everyone would gather here, I just wanted to make sure that I invited someone suitable.\u201d\u2026Suitable? For what?Then, she clapped her hands as if to lighten up the atmosphere.\u201cOkay then, let\u2019s start the meeting! The first agenda, as you can see, is the recruitment of a new talent. Did you hear about it from the chief of staff?\u201dThe attention of the Lords was focused again, and the Overlord smiled and made eye contact with me.\u201cFirst, I want you to tell me your name directly.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ron.\u201dThis was the start.There was no particular crisis yet, but I couldn\u2019t let go of the tension.Something had confused me ever since the Overlord appeared.What was the reason for bringing me, a complete outsider, to the meeting of the Lords and sitting in this seat, as the Thunder Lord said?I don\u2019t think she would want me to fight with the Lords just to test my abilities\u2026\u201cOkay. Then, Sir Ron, what is your purpose in coming to Calderic?\u201d\u2026What kind of interview was this?I was quite nervous because a more ordinary question came than what I thought.I stared at her without answering the question right away.\u201cAh, of course, I know it was our chief of staff who suggested it first. What I\u2019m curious about is why you agreed.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m in a state of shock right now. A person as powerful as you suddenly visit the castle. With your ability, it\u2019s enough for enjoying whatever you want, wherever you want, as long as it\u2019s a goal involving wealth and fame. So, what\u2019s the special reason for coming to Calderic?\u201dSpecial reason my foot.This place was just the only option I had after facing a dead end. There\u2019s nothing more to that.I knew all the Overlord\u2019s abilities.I knew it would be useless to lie, so I answered as honestly as I could.\u201cThere is no specific purpose.\u201dThe Overlord narrowed her eyes.As if to gauge the true meaning of my words.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s just as I heard from Dayphon. Then, are you saying that you came here purely out of interest?\u201dShe smiled again, raising the corners of her mouth, and nodded her head while humming, \u2018good, good\u2019.She looked like a boyish girl, but I didn\u2019t find it cute at all.Because I knew the truth hidden inside was a monster that was nearly a thousand years old.What you see now was just a polymorph shell, not her real body.So, what\u2019s the point?Anyway, I was sure I didn\u2019t end up sitting in this meeting just for those questions.This was the real beginning.I waited patiently for the words to follow.The Overlord\u2019s mouth opened again.\u201cSir Ron, do you want to become a Lord?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This was not just empty words. I\u2019m asking you if you are really willing to be one.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cRight now, the seat of the Seventh Lord has been vacant for several years. It just can\u2019t continue to be empty like that. But there\u2019s no one who I really like. Just in time, Sir Ron came to visit the castle. And I really would like it if you take over the seat of the Seventh Lord.\u201d\u2026What the hell was this woman talking about?Take the position of the Seventh Lord? Who? I?Hearing her say that, she probably really wasn\u2019t joking.I could barely keep my expression, hiding the absurdity and bewilderment.But why is the Seventh Lord\u2019s seat empty?Where did the Seventh Lord\u2014the Ghost, Lifrigon, that I knew evaporate?It\u2019s like the warrior being a different guy from who I remembered. Was there really a time difference between the RaSa I played and the one I was experiencing now?Since all the other Lords are the same, it\u2019s probably not the future. So, it\u2019s from the past\u2026 ah.The timeline now was probably a few years before the game started.Well, now wasn\u2019t really the time to think about that, but\u2026\u201cOverlord\u2026 are you serious?\u201dBreaking the brief silence, the first one to speak was the Thunder Lord.\u201cI was wondering why you had an outsider attend the meeting suddenly, so it was because of this. Was it to decide here right away?\u201dThe Tyrant also let out a laugh and buried his back in the chair.The other Lords said nothing, but they all had expressions as if saying these were all absurd. Except for the Heavenly Palace, who looked like he was in his own world from the start.But they were right to have those feelings.The Nine Lords were beings with absolute power no one could touch except for the Overlord, Rashtain. They were also the symbol of Calderic.The Overlord, right now, was trying to decide the person to sit in such a lofty seat, as if she was simply choosing a lunch menu.I was so dumbfounded, but I wondered how the other Lords would be as shocked.The Overlord laughed quietly to herself.\u201cIt may be sudden, but everyone knows it, right? That there is nothing else necessary for the Lord\u2019s seat except for ability.\u201dThe Thunder Lord immediately protested.\u201cThis is hard to understand. How did that man prove his ability?\u201d\u201cHe proved it enough. I heard he killed Santea\u2019s warrior in one blow.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that right, Chief of Staff?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dDayphon affirmed the Overlord\u2019s question.Naturally, she seemed to have heard of everything that had happened in the convoy.\u201cHuh? He killed the warrior?\u201dThe Lords looked quite surprised.Of course, all the Lords of Calderic were strong beings of a higher rank than the warrior.In terms of simple numbers, it was only a difference of a few levels. But at high levels, especially in the 80s and 90s, each level was a big gap.The point that surprised them was not the fact that I killed the warrior, but probably the part where I killed him with a single blow.\u201cBesides, he discovered my identity at once. Who else could do that?\u201dAt those words, all the Lords fell silent.Now it seemed that the other Lords had been subjected to similar pranks by the Overlord.In the meantime, the Heavenly Palace, who had been quiet until now, suddenly raised his hand.\u201cYes, except for the Third Lord.\u201dThe Heavenly Palace lowered his hand and stared blankly into space once again.The other Lords didn\u2019t even care about him acting like that. As if they were already used to his eccentricity.The Wiseman looked at Dayphon and asked.\u201cBut High Overlord, I\u2019m curious about the details of the Chief of Staff\u2019s mission when he went to Santea this time.\u201d\u201cEven if you didn\u2019t ask, it was one of the meeting\u2019s agenda, so let\u2019s put it aside for now.\u201dThe Overlord looked around the table.\u201cAnyway, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much problem with Sir Ron sitting in the Lord\u2019s seat. What do you think? Are there any objections?\u201dThen, the Thunder Lord opened her mouth once again.\u201cThen can I check it myself?\u201dCheck?It was clear what the other meant.\u201cWe\u2019re talking about the capabilities of this human called \u2018Ron\u2019. If the Overlord allows it, a light duel would be enough.\u201d\u2026In an instant, my heart cooled down.Calmness forced my heart to sink.It had to happen.From the time I entered the meeting room and got stuck with these monsters called \u2018Lords\u2019, the crisis I was concerned about had never gone down.\u201cSeriously, Second Lord? Are you trying to blow up the Overlord\u2019s Castle?\u201dThe Mad King rested her chin on the armrest of the chair and laughed.\u201cIs there any problem with that Overlord? Things are definitely going well.\u201dThe Black Sea Empress also rustled her antennae and helped with a word.All the other Lords also showed interest.\u201cHmm, well\u2026\u201dThe overlord looked in my direction.Seeing that smiley expression on her face, I had the feeling that she had expected something like this from the beginning.\u201cWhat do you think, Sir Ron?\u201d\u2026There\u2019s nothing to think.Second Lord, the Thunder Lord, Elyse.Fighting that monster that could even cause a lightning storm in an entire area if she used her full power?A confrontation between an ant and an elephant would be much more rational than that.With one gesture from her, my whole body would turn into black ash and fly away.Except for one instant kill, I really didn\u2019t have any abilities.Is there a hole where I can escape\u2026?Everyone was waiting for my answer.If I avoided a fight for no reason, I didn\u2019t know what kind of reaction they would have.But things were definitely not going in the right direction for me.For a moment, a pretty plausible bravado came to mind.I didn\u2019t know if it would work, but the atmosphere would get weird if I stayed silent here longer.I glanced at the Thunder Lord and opened my mouth.\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind being killed.\u201d And then added. \u201cI have little talent for being moderate.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was actually a much more violent reaction than I expected.If a match was made in which neither side would end well, there would be no way the Overlord would allow a fight\u2026 wouldn\u2019t it?Hurry and stop the duel.The atmosphere felt like a lightning bolt would hit the spot when I was sitting at any moment.The Overlord opened her mouth. There was some regret in her voice, perhaps because she realized she had been too hasty.\u201cStop.\u201dUnlike before, it was a slightly serious voice.After that, the Thunder Lord calmed down. But she was still glaring at me.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do about it. It won\u2019t be a light duel at all, will it?\u201dThe Overlord, who said with an innocent voice, smiled as if to lighten the atmosphere.I let out a deep sigh of relief.I was glad that it went safely as I thought.The other Lords, who all seemed unfathomable, seemed regretful that they missed out on a good spectacle.\u201cWell, I don\u2019t really care.\u201dThe Mad King smiled and said.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s vulgar like that vampire. Appointing a monarch is the Overlord\u2019s authority anyway, so is there a reason to hear our approval?\u201d\u201cWhy am I being mentioned again?\u201dThe Tyrant clicked his tongue and muttered.The Wiseman also glanced at me and stepped in to help.\u201cIt\u2019s sudden, but I don\u2019t doubt the Overlord\u2019s eyesight. Also, the seat of the Seventh Lord can\u2019t be vacant forever. The chief of staff is also not dissatisfied with the decision.\u201dExcept for the Thunder Lord, no other Lords showed any complaint.Rather than agreeing, it was close to showing signs of accepting, saying nothing because they were just not interested, or because the Overlord\u2019s will was absolute.But I hadn\u2019t said I would accept it yet, so why was everything already confirmed?\u2026I wonder if that\u2019s the case.She in the ruler of Calderic.She\u2019s at the very apex of Calderic\u2019s power, one of the four majors powers on the continent. Who would normally refuse a seat she was offering?The problem was that I didn\u2019t really have any abilities that fit the position of a Lord.Until now, everyone had a huge misunderstanding about my ability because of how the situation fit in. But even the lowest guard guarding the castle gate could kill me.How long would this good fortune last?If I accepted the Overlord\u2019s offer and truly became the Seventh Lord, then I would cross the river of no return.But if I refuse\u2026It was also a risky option.It wasn\u2019t my will, but anyway, I came to the Overlord\u2019s castle and attended the meeting of the Lords in order to not have any enemies in Calderic.And the Overlord offered the best conditions she could offer.What kind of reaction would come back if I said I would reject it in an atmosphere like this?Perhaps the Overlord\u2019s friendly demeanour could turn into hostility in an instant. Dare I took that risk?I didn\u2019t know if it would be a foolish recklessness to check it out myself, or if the right choice was to avoid the worst.Should I ask for time to think?My brain felt congested.Wouldn\u2019t it be better to postpone the decision for a while?Then the Mad King looked at me and opened her mouth.\u201cAnyway, it\u2019s a pity. I promised in front of the meeting room that we should try duelling sometime.\u201d\u2026When did you make that promise?And what did that have to do with me being a Lord? But I soon understood.Come to think of it, wasn\u2019t there a setting in Calderic that battles between Lords were strictly forbidden?It was the minimum discipline for Lords with very strong individuality to coexist without major conflict.\u201cI also really hate ending things in moderation. At least until one side is dead, that\u2019s a proper duel, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe bloody sound of laughing suddenly reminded me of a terrifying possibility.If I refused the position of a Lord, after the meeting was over, that crazy monster might get excited and start a fight with me.Even during their first meeting, she pointed her sword at my neck without hesitation, so the possibility was there.But was that all? Even now, the Thunder Lord next to me was glaring at me with eyes that seemed ready to eat me.If I refused, I have to worry about what would happen after the meeting was over.Accept or reject.Either way, it\u2019s a choice between the worst and the lesser evil. Similar to what happened on the convoy ship.I regretted that bringing the situation to this point.After all, I had to somehow escape this damn castle in order to escape the reach of the Overlord.\u2026But regret was useless.\u201cNow, only Sir Ron\u2019s answer remains.\u201dThe Overlord\u2019s final proclamation.\u201cAs the Overlord of Calderic, I will make a formal proposal for you. Will you take the seat of the Sevent Lord?\u201dA quiet silence descended on the conference hall, and the attention of all the Lords on the round table was now focused on me.Having finally decided, I opened my mouth with half resignation.\u201c\u2026I accept.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There\u2019s no story like this one.The realm of Calderic could be divided into 10 areas, with the center as the Overlord\u2019s main domain and land of the First to Ninth Lords surrounding it.The Lords were not just called Lords for nothing. Each ruled a land like a kingdom.Now that I was the Seventh Lord, I could hold all the power over the area called \u2018Enlock\u2019.This was possible because the throne of Calderic had no succession by blood, and was only determined under the appointment of the Overlord.But that didn\u2019t mean that the nine Lords swore absolute allegiance to the Overlord or anything like that.Although the Overlord was the head of the Lords, as seen in the meeting, the relationship between them was more like a contractual relationship.Except for a few set conditions, Lords could act freely without being bound by anything.I remembered reading the reason this bizarre structure could be achieved and maintained in a setting book related to the origin of Calderic.I remembered that the explanation was quite detailed, but this was the only key point that came to mind.Because the ability of the Overlord was that great, and she had naturally solidified the power over a long period under such competence.Some of the current Lords had already been with the Overlord for over a hundred years, and in particular, the First Lord, the Wiseman, had been a Lord for hundreds of years since the establishment of Calderic.The system that had been carried on under such a long bond was in some ways more solid than the typical monarchy, like the Santean Empire Federation....That\u2019s all fine and good.But where did things get so twisted?After a series of regrets, I suddenly felt funny.Where did it get twisted?What did I do to enter this game in the first place? Even if something was twisted, did it really have to get this twisted?I got out of bed and picked up a fruit that looked like an apple from a basket on the table.I took a big bite and the sweet juice spread in my mouth.It was subtly different from the apple flavor I was used to, but it tasted good anyway.I just couldn\u2019t think of anything to eat because of the situation, but I had been hungry since earlier.I ate a few fruits in an instant because of my sudden hunger, and then I sat down and leaned back in my chair.There\u2019s really nothing complicated about it.I had already crossed the river of no return, anyway.Was there any need to regret every single thing and lament on the situation?Rather than that, preparing for what lay ahead was much more productive.As soon as I decided, the sluggish emotion disappeared in an instant.Thanks to the [Soul of the King], a cold coolness was established at the very core of my heart so that I would not be shaken easily.This was not Earth.It wasn\u2019t even a modern world like the 21st century.Monsters, war, demons\u2026 a wild and hideous land full of many dangers and where the value of life was insignificant.In the end, unless I found a secure way to return to the original reality, this fragile life could be threatened.I knew very well what kind of dark future awaited this world.But there was nothing to be disappointed about.As one of the early players of RaSa, I had a lot of knowledge and information about this world in my head.It\u2019s also not like I didn\u2019t have any abilities at all.Didn\u2019t I have an instant kill and the soul of a king, a mental sustainer that exerted absolute effects?Of course, it would have been perfect if they transferred all the abilities of my game character.Either way, it\u2019s not a bad situation if one looked at it well.The title of the Seventh Lord of Calderic.It came with a huge risk, but it could also give me a huge boost.At least within Calderic\u2019s realm, I could exert absolute power.It would depend on what I would do in the future, but it will be a great advantage to prepare for the upcoming dangers by using the information I had.Anyway, the Overlord is\u2026A stream of thoughts led to Overlord Rashtain.The Overlord was more unpredictable that anyone could have imagined.I didn\u2019t know what exactly she had in mind for giving me a seat, but it made little sense at all.I guess there\u2019s a reason she asked that.Why did you come to Calderic?That was the first question the Overlord asked me.I was guessing, but maybe that wasn\u2019t just for confirmation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Isn\u2019t that right, Dayphon?\u201dDayphon did not respond to Rashtain\u2019s words.It was because he knew she wasn\u2019t looking for an answer.But he also had the same idea.Appointing a new Lord was the sole responsibility of the Overlord, but disposing of the Lord once appointed was not something even she could do on her own.If it had not been for the empty seat, it would not have been appropriate to give any other Lord\u2019s seat to the newly appointed Lord who had only appeared today.\u201cIt was a little surprising, though.\u201d\u201cHmm, what? That I gave him the position of the Lord right away?\u201d\u201cSir Ron\u2026 I guess I should call him Seventh Lord from now on. Anyway, I expected you would offer him that position the moment he\u2019s invited to the meeting.\u201dRashtain grinned.\u201cSeeing him once was enough.\u201dRon.When she thought about it again, he was truly a strange human being.She was genuinely surprised, especially when he discovered her disguise.It was a half-joking test, but none of the other Lords previously recognized her identity at once, except for the current Third Lord, the Heavenly Palace.Above all, if once reached her level, they could not only see the simple external elements but also the much more essential part within.A supreme soul reminiscent of a king.She didn\u2019t know what his true abilities were yet, but at least he was as strong as the other Lords.\u201cAnd didn\u2019t you see it? That bored expression on his face?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIf I had spent a little more time unnecessarily, he would have definitely walked out, hahaha!\u201dDayphon was also paying attention to Ron throughout the meeting.The other\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change so much that he thought he might refuse the position of the Lord, but fortunately, that didn\u2019t happen.\u201cThe Seventh Lord is going to move right away?\u201d\u201cPerhaps he will stay in the castle a little longer. I had sent a messenger to Enlock.\u201d\u201cYes. Anyway, you\u2019ve worked hard. This outcome was even a much bigger achievement than our original purpose.\u201dThere was also the plan for the chief of staff, Dayphon, to move directly to Santea, but now, Rashtain was only thinking about Ron.\u201cI heard he was on the Archemon convoy as a prisoner.\u201dShe heard everything before the meeting started about the incident in the convoy and the situation when Dayphon first met Ron.Even how he killed the warrior, Garten.\u201cDid you really not feel any special energy when you kill the warrior?\u201d\u201cYes none. \u00a0Maybe I simply didn\u2019t recognize it, but I was at a close distance of less than ten steps\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm, then I guess it\u2019s not magic at all.\u201dFrom the moment she entered the meeting hall pretending to be a servant, Rashtain had paid close attention to Ron.However, she obviously did not feel any magic power.\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous that even my senses were deceived. It\u2019s highly likely that it\u2019s a \u2018mystery\u2019.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cOr maybe it\u2019s a racial trait I don\u2019t know about at all. Just because he looks like he might be human doesn\u2019t mean that he really is. I wonder what kind of ability it is.\u201dLooking at her murmuring with a wide smile of interest on her lips, Dayphon asked insinuatingly;\u201cWhy don\u2019t the Overlord find out more?\u201d\u201cI told you, I don\u2019t want him to become my enemy. At least, not yet. Besides, Ron wasn\u2019t even his real name.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 was that the case?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dRashtain knew Ron hadn\u2019t given his real name.It was easy for her to distinguish the truth from lies mixed in the other person\u2019s words.\u201cThe rest of what he said was fine. But\u2026 I\u2019d like to find out his identity myself. It surely has been a while since something like this happened, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026You mean you\u2019re going to Santea?\u201d\u201cHaha, don\u2019t be too surprised. It\u2019s not right now, but maybe later, when I have time. Dayphon, you always worry too much.\u201dRashtain waved her hand and grinned.\u201cAnyway, let\u2019s watch him slowly. I\u2019m looking forward to what our new Seventh Lord will do in the future.\u201d***Several days passed.Life in the Overlord\u2019s castle was extremely comfortable. The meal was great, and the bed was comfortable.There was nothing inconvenient as the attendants were waiting nearby and I could immediately ordered anything I needed.\u201c\u2026\u201dI was standing by the window in a daze, getting some fresh air.I could see knights gathering and training in a wide space like a plaza on one side of the castle.The reason I was still staying here instead of moving to the Seventh Lord\u2019s territory was because I had to organize my thoughts.I had a busy time in my own way, almost confined to my room for a few days.First, I confirmed that this world had a time difference from the background of RaSa which I played, as expected.It was the 759th year of the Rachronia continental calendar, exactly five years in the past.Including what would happen in the future, important or even a little useful information was drawn from my memory and written. Lest I forgot it.Since there was no way anyone would recognize the handwriting written in Korean, there was nothing to feel burdened by the memo.And based on the above information, I also made a rough plan for the future.What I needed most is power.The top priority, of course, was to strengthen my personal specs.I was to weak.Including personal safety issues, there were limits to what could be done with only a level 1 force.Then instant kill skill was a trump card that could kill anyone as long as there\u2019s contact, but that\u2019s all.If I could level up by killing opponents and gaining experience points, just like when I played the game, then I don\u2019t have to worry about increasing my specs.But now that the game had become a reality, unfortunately, that seemed impossible.If the experience point system remained as it was, something should have changed when I killed the warrior.In addition, there was no other systems such as stats, skill information window, or inventory. I tried to mumble into the air, just in case, but nothing came out.Except for two skills I had and the level indicator in my field of vision, this was almost a perfect reality.So, how could I be strong in this \u2018reality\u2019?Of course, you just have to suffer and train yourself. Like those novels you have read.But I couldn\u2019t afford that.By the way, nothing had changed that showed me that I had a great talent for things like swordsmanship or magic.How much time would it take to train and become strong enough? Who would I be learning from?After a few years, would I be able to barely become strong enough to level 30?Even the weakest knight in the Overlord\u2019s castle would have a much higher level than that.Because of this, there was only one way.I just needed to gain the ability that would allow me to become stronger in an instant with no effort.Mysteries hidden all over the continent, or hidden pieces such as ruins.Right now, there was a mystery that could be got just by travelling from the Overlord\u2019s castle to the Seventh Lord\u2019s territory.It wouldn\u2019t enhance my intrinsic fighting power, but anyway, it was the only way to instantly amplify my specs in a short period. But\u2026It won\u2019t be easy after all.As with any fantasy novels, the place where the mystery was hidden was usually in a rough place. It was no different in here.Whether it be monsters or traps, I could not overcome all dangers that I would face in reaching the destination.Should I use the Lord\u2019s power to get someone who could do so?I didn\u2019t know if I should really do that if there\u2019s no other way, but doing so would make me feel uneasy.Also, there were things that couldn\u2019t be obtained unless I would go there myself.In the first place, going around the continent to find those mysteries was something I couldn\u2019t do alone.Because of this, an excellent assistant was needed.As assistant who could take responsibility for my safety anytime, anywhere\u2026 yes, an escort.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thank you to Jess for donating! ^^Level 70.Considering this and that, an escort of at least level 70 was needed.It\u2019s a shabby level compared to the Lords, but in the first place, they were monsters outside the standard, and even at level 70, that was actually already very strong.If level 30 was a level that could massacre 100 ordinary soldiers alone, then level 70 could kill that level 30 easily.It won\u2019t be a problem to find an escort itself, but\u2026Even if I just went to the Seventh Lord\u2019s castle right away, I could find a person who met the conditions without difficulty.But the question was, how much could I trust them?What I really wanted was a helper who would always stick by my side and escort me, but, of course, trust was a bigger problem than ability.Just in case, I had to have someone I could trust as an escort.\u201c\u2026haa.\u201dIt\u2019s such a burden to be in a position that didn\u2019t fit one\u2019s ability.I had done nothing yet, but just thinking about the future made me feel like I was already blocked.I let out a small sigh and buried my back in the chair.Then, with a sudden thought, I called Caren outside the room.\u201cI want to read a book. Is there a library in the castle?\u201d\u201cYes, there is.\u201dI asked just in case, but the answer was positive.It was said that there was not just one, but several, and even the central library existed separately.Come to think of it, there was nothing strange about having a library in the castle.The Overlord\u2019s castle did not differ from the Santea Empire\u2019s imperial palace.\u201cIf you tell me the type of book you want, I will immediately get it for you\u2026\u201d\u201cNo need. I\u2019m planning to go there myself, so guide me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do that right away.\u201dCaren said something to the surrounding attendants.Surprised by this, the attendants hurriedly ran to somewhere. I was just asking for guidance. What were they doing?Anyway, I followed her to the library.Every time I met someone walking down the hallway, some of them were startled and silent. I could feel their gaze in between.I hardly showed my face, let alone did anything, but rumors about me had already spread throughout the castle.Anyway, elves, beastmen, dwarves, giants, and even some rare races.Here in Calderic, there were so many races.It was still a landscape that wasn\u2019t easy to get used to, but it would probably get better.The central library was a couple of buildings away from the building where my room was located.The square where the knights who I saw training from the window were near the path, so I passed by and glanced at it.As soon as I arrived at the library and entered, I saw an old man standing respectfully at the entrance, as if he had been waiting for me.Judging by the petite body and the shape of the tail attached to the back, he was a member of the rat tribe among the beastmen.\u201cWelcome, Seventh Lord. It is an honor to have you here in the Central Library.\u201d\u2026I was wondering why they were in such a hurry. Did they tell the news that I was coming here?An old man from the rat tribe, who introduced himself as the director, offered to guide me, but I refused because it\u2019s unnecessary.I left the two of them behind and strolled inside.The inside of the library was empty with no one, so it was quiet, with no noise.I didn\u2019t know if it was vacant from the beginning, or if they were all evicted before I came.It\u2019s very wide.After looking around, I could see why the director had offered to guide me.The classification of books by bookshelf wasn\u2019t that detailed, so it seemed like it would take quite a while to find the book I was looking for.But it didn\u2019t matter.I wasn\u2019t looking for a book with a specific content, but anything like a swordsman\u2019s book or a magic book was fine.This way.I soon found a bookshelf full of magic books and stopped walking.Then, after picking out a book, I started skimming through it.There was no problem at all reading the contents.From the moment I possessed this body for the first time, I could understand the common language of the Rachronia continent, the language of this world that I had never encountered.\u201c\u2026\u201dOf course, apart from that, I couldn\u2019t understand a single thing in the book I was reading now.Magic theory\u2026 It seemed to be related to some mathematical principle, but I did not know what it was.Anyway, I can\u2019t.Turning the pages to the end, I clicked my tongue and closed the book.I didn\u2019t go here to find a magic book to leisurely learn magic.It\u2019s because when I was playing the game, sometimes there were cases where I could learn a skill from a book-shaped item like a magic book, so I wanted to try if I could find one here.However, my expectation was too high.After looking at a few more books, I neatly threw away my lingering feelings.After spending some time looking at other books, I left the library with Caren, who was waiting at the entrance.Should I ask her to make me a snack since I\u2019m hungry?On the way back to the room while I was thinking nonsensical things, the knights training at the square came into my sight again.A lot of time had passed since a while ago, but it was still a scene where the heated training was in full swing.\u201c\u2026?\u201dAs I stared at them with little thought, I had no choice but to stop my gaze at one spot.It was because I suddenly discovered something disparate among the knights.[Lv. 81]A gray-haired female knight clashing swords with another knight as if sparring.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They are doing their afternoon training.\u201dIf it was the White Star Knights, it was an elite force directly under the Overlord.By the way, average knights from aristocratic families were around level 30, but in the Overlord Castle, even those over level 40 were just apprentice knights\u2026\u201c\u2026!\u201dOh, I remembered.That pure white hair, a knight belonging to Calderic.Of course, there was a big difference between the game graphics and the appearance in reality, but it was enough to evoke a strange familiarity.\u201cIs that man the superior of the knights?\u201dI asked, pointing to a man who seemed to walk around among the knights and guiding them.\u201cYes, the vice-captain of the 5th White Star Knights\u2026\u201d\u201cCould you call him over here for a minute?\u201dIt was a very sudden request. Even so, Caren was taken aback for a moment.However, she immediately replied that she knew and approached the knights.She talked to the man and quickly brought him in front of me. Now, this was power.[Lv. 63]\u201cIt\u2019s an infinite honor to meet the Seventh Lord! I\u2019m Camson, the depute commander of the 5th Knights of White Star.\u201dA man frozen with tension gave a stiff salute.\u201cThere is something I want to ask you.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes! I will do my best to answer anything!\u201d\u201cThat white-haired woman over there.\u201dI pointed at the woman and asked.\u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201dPerhaps it was an unexpected question. Vice-captain Camson put on a puzzled expression for a moment before replying quickly.\u201cShe\u2019s Asher, an apprentice knight. She\u2019s a newcomer who joined three months ago and is currently undergoing the apprenticeship process.\u201d\u2026Huh.The moment I heard that name, I felt a slight goose bump down my spine.Could there really be such a coincidence?Asher Gronhilde.One of the main protagonists of RaSa\u2019s main story.At first, she appeared as an enemy, but as the story progressed, she was incorporated into the allied camp and was a powerful ally.She was an apprentice knight in the Overlord\u2019s castle.One natural question was bound to follow.Why did she become an apprentice knight?If the level was over 80, it was a level that could go beyond the White Star Knights\u2019 commander and become a member of the Black Star\u2014the elite knights of the Overlord Castle. She actually belonged to the Black Star Knights when she first appeared in the game.\u2026It\u2019s rough, but I know her background and circumstances.Because of this, I could come up with a plausible guess right away.She\u2019s probably still wary of her surroundings, that\u2019s why she joined while hiding her abilities.What should I do with this?After the sparring, Asher was holding the sword with no sign of fatigue.This was a great opportunity.Even if not, now I had to find a reliable escort. And if it was her, she was a character that could be trusted enough.Besides, if i could use someone who was strong enough now, but who had the potential to grow to the level of a Lord in the future, she\u2019s definitely more than qualified to be an escort.The problem is how to convince her.Currently, Asher was a knight belonging to the Overlord Castle.Of course, with the power of the Lord, it wouldn\u2019t be difficult to bring in an apprentice knight no matter if they belonged to the Overlord\u2019s castle, but there was another problem.Asher had a clear purpose for becoming a knight here.If I took her here with little thought, she might not only dislike me but also become hostile to me as well.\u201c\u2026\u201dLet\u2019s try it.Since I had already found her like this, it\u2019s too good to just give up and pass by.Having decided, I opened my mouth again.\u201cWhen will training end?\u201d\u201cWe plan to continue for another hour\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019d like to talk to her. Can I bring her with me when it\u2019s over?\u201dAt my words, the vice-captain became dumbfounded. This was an unexpected reaction.In Calderic, the Lord was in the sky.It was a situation where such a Lord had something to do with an apprentice knight and would take them.\u201cMm- of course! You can bring her with you right now\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, an hour later.\u201dI said, with no area for refusal.I needed time to organize my thoughts before we could talk.\u201cI\u2019ll go back first, so when training is over, bring her to my room.\u201dAt my words, Caren\u2019s gaze became a little strange.I regretted it immediately. My words could definitely cause a useless misunderstanding.\u201cI just want to talk.\u201dWhen I added something, she bowed her head as if to apologize.I looked at Asher one last time and turned around.My mind went busy. How could I entice her to be my escort?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My name is Asher, an apprentice knight belonging to the White Star 5th Knights.\u201dSaluting with an expressionless face, she was wearing casual clothes, not greaves for training.\u201cSit down.\u201dI gestured to the seat opposite.After standing silently for a moment, Asher sat down.A table with two people sitting opposite each other. Silence pervaded the room.Slurp.I sipped my tea without saying a word and glanced at the other side.Asher, who was staring down at the teacup in front of her, lifted her head, perhaps sensing my gaze.I vaguely felt the various emotions in those bright scarlet eyes.Tension, vigilance, and doubt. Eyes saying that she did not know what she was doing here.\u2026Honestly, this only made me more nervous.The woman sitting in front of me right now was a monster over level 80, and what I was going to say from now on would definitely irritate her greatly.But to persuade her, this would be the best way.I opened my mouth.\u201cAre you hiding your ability?\u201dStraight to the point, with no procrastination.\u201c\u2026\u201dAsher\u2019s expression slowly hardened.\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re an apprentice knight with such skills. I wonder why you\u2019re hiding your power.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201dA weakly sharp, clearly wary voice.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to deny it, I\u2019ll get straight to the point.\u201dHer eyes widened at my words.\u201cWhite Moon Tribe.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201cI heard it was destroyed, but there\u2019s clearly a survivor. Why did you come to the Overlord\u2019s castle?\u201dThe sharpened hostility immediately pierced my whole body.Compared to the aura of the Thunder Lord I had experienced during the Lords\u2019 meeting, it was far behind, but it still contained great pressure.Faced with her gaze as she glared at me with a fiercely distorted face, I said calmly.\u201cStop thinking about useless things. It\u2019s impossible to win against me on your own.\u201dOf course, it was a bluff.If she drew her sword and swung it here, I would die without even realizing that I was dying.But I had faith that it wouldn\u2019t.First, Asher was not the type to kill lightly. Although this was her past self when the game hadn\u2019t started yet. Her nature wouldn\u2019t be different.Above all, she was not reckless enough to attack anyone much stronger that herself without hesitation.No matter how proud she was of her skills, she must know the fact that a Lord of Calderic was a different being.\u201c\u2026\u201dAs if the bluff had worked, Asher bit her lip tightly and regained whatever killing intent she had released.It was embarrassing to see the blood dripping down from her bitten lip.Perhaps now she was even more confused.She was completely confused about how I knew who she was and what my purpose was.Persuasion had just begun.Now, let\u2019s start with the negotiation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She felt a slight uneasiness in the corner of her heart.\u201cPlease keep in mind that the person you are about to meet is the new Seventh Lord. Please be careful with your words and actions.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAfter hearing the last warning from Caren, they reached the last room in the long corridor.Clap.As the door closed and she faced the Seventh Lord alone, Asher greeted him with a bow.\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to meet the Seventh Lord. My name is Asher, an apprentice knight belonging to the White Star 5th Knights.\u201dThe bright golden eyes gazed intently at me.\u201cSit down.\u201dThe Seventh Lord gestured to the seat opposite him.Asher sat down, feeling awkward.For a moment, there was silence in the room.The Seventh Lord savored the tea, saying nothing, and Asher, who had no place to look, stared down at the teacup.Before long, an unexpected comment cut off the silence.\u201cAre you hiding your ability?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re an apprentice knight with such skills. I wonder why you\u2019re hiding your power.\u201dTwo questions popped into Asher\u2019s head with more bewilderment.\u2018How did you know that, and why would you ask me about it?\u2019If he noticed it from the time he was watching the training earlier, it would have been truly astonishing.At that distance, what on earth did you perceive and notice? Mana? Or some other difference?\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201dAt first, it was denial.Asher calmed her agitation and looked at the reaction of the Seventh Lord.He continued talking without changing his expression at all.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to deny it, I\u2019ll get straight to the point.\u201dMain point?Until this very moment, she hadn\u2019t realized it yet.That the previous worry was not important at all.\u201cWhite Moon Tribe.\u201d\u2026Her heart sank.\u201cI heard it was destroyed, but there\u2019s clearly a survivor. Why did you come to the Overlord\u2019s castle?\u201dFor a moment, Asher\u2019s mind went blank, and she could say nothing.How\u2026She could somehow understand that he noticed she hid her true abilities.But how did he find out that she was a White Moon?It was the deepest secret that no one knew anymore, and none should have ever known.It was a reflexive and unconscious action to show hostility at the being in front of her, who casually revealed such a secret.\u201cStop thinking about useless things. It\u2019s impossible to win against me on your own.\u201dAsher suddenly came to her senses at the indifferent voice she heard.The gaze of the Seventh Lord was infinitely deep and calm.Feeling overwhelmed by the static intimidation, she slowly withdrew her hostility.\u201c\u2026\u201dYes\u2026 it\u2019s impossible.The being sitting in front of her right now was a Lord of Calderic.A top-notch powerhouse in all the continent. An existence that was said to be stronger than the monstrous Five Star of Santea.Just looking at the fact that he saw through her hidden power at one glance, the difference in rank was definitely quite large.Any attempt, be it a surprise attack or escape, would be futile.Feeling helpless at that fact, Asher bit her lip tightly. She could taste the fishy taste of her blood.I came all the way to this place, overcoming despair and despondency to move on, but would this be the end before I could even try anything?\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201dTrembling with resentment, she squeezed her voice out, and the Seventh Lord made a strange expression.\u201cYou seem to misunderstand something. I\u2019m not trying to threaten you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat are you so afraid of?\u201dAt those words, Asher gritted her teeth.She couldn\u2019t say anything.No one would understand unless they were the person involved.The sorrow of losing both their family and their home, the loneliness and anxiety of being thrown into the world as a single survivor, the pressure of wanting to do something.This was Calderic, not Santea.A land of power and opportunity where one could grab what they wanted if they had the ability.In her head, Asher knew that, too.However, the wariness deeply imprinted in her heart from the day her tribe was destroyed made her unable to trust anyone or anything easily.But what the hell did this person even know?\u201cI do understand.\u201dAsher was taken aback.\u201cI can understand. The longing and sadness you have deep inside your heart, the anxiety and solitude. All the excessive vigilance you show me right now must have originated from that. Right?\u201d\u2026What the hell was this guy talking about?Asher looked at the Seventh Lord with a slightly dazed expression.His mouth opened again.\u201cI will help you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Other than herself, there must be another survivor somewhere.Calderic was a land that valued one\u2019s ability above all else.If she proved her worth and established herself here, if she could make a name for herself throughout the continent as a White Moon warrior, maybe some survivors would hear the news and come find her.Even if they didn\u2019t come, she might aim for even the smallest opportunity to take revenge on Santea by building up strength and power.\u2026Asher came to Calderic with that thought in mind.The reason she hid her power and identity to be an apprentice knight was so she could observe the atmosphere since she just arrived at Calderic.The White Moon tribe was usually indistinguishable from humans, but because of their unique trait, their entire body turned white when they exert their strength.Eventually, soon, she fully revealed herself and became a Black Star knight of the Overlord Castle. But\u2026\u201cI will help you.\u201dNow, before that happened, I should first put her to my side.I then opened my mouth.\u201cI can roughly guess the purpose of your coming to Calderic.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cEither to spread fame and make other survivors of your tribe reach out to you, or to get revenge on Santea. Maybe it\u2019s both\u2026 Judging by your expression, it seems to be the correct answer.\u201dAsher\u2019s face was now full of astonishment.It was a natural reaction, since it seemed like I could see through her inner thoughts perfectly.The time had come to bring out the main purpose of this talk.\u201cIf that\u2019s your purpose, then I suggest you become my escort knight.\u201dAsher became dumbfounded for a moment.She\u2019s probably wondering what kind of nonsense this was.\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d\u201cI will do many things from now on. So become my escort and follow me around. It will be a good opportunity to spread your reputation throughout the continent as the sword of the Seventh Lord of Calderic, as my closest aide, and as a warrior of the White Moon tribe.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you think borrowing my name is much more effective in achieving your goals than relying on your own strength?\u201dIt was the perfect excuse.My suggestion would be a very effective way to achieve the goal of spreading fame as widely as possible across the continent.Asher blinked silently.Then she asked me again with a wary face that showed that he couldn\u2019t understand.\u201cWhy?\u201dYes, of course she would ask that.It was an expected reaction.To her, my proposal would feel like a one-sided courtesy for no reason.In her mind, beings like a Lord wouldn\u2019t do this because they really needed an escort.Of course, I really needed an escort to act as my arms and legs, but I couldn\u2019t tell her the truth.\u201cThere is no particular reason.\u201dI said dryly.\u201cIf I had to explain it, it\u2019s because I understand your situation. And because your ability caught my eye by chance. That\u2019s why I was naturally interested in you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAsher was still mixed with disbelief.After all, I couldn\u2019t convince her with such an ambiguous answer.A good reason, huh.I thought hard about it for an hour before we started this conversation, but in the end I couldn\u2019t find any other good excuse.I thought of a typical scenario of having some kind of relationship with her tribe, but it didn\u2019t feel very plausible.What could a human being have to do with a minority race living deep in the mountains?Also, even if I concocted a story, there was a high risk that I would be caught in that lie easily.Because I knew little about the White Moon.Therefore, the conclusion that came to the end was to ignore that.For now, it was enough to make Asher accept my offer somehow.In the first place, it was arrogance to gain trust by exposing all the other person\u2019s circumstances and secrets from the first meeting.I could slowly build a friendly relationship with her up in time.\u201cYou still don\u2019t have an answer. But is the reason for me doing this really that important?\u201dI stressed that point once again.\u201cI want you to become an escort knight, so that you achieve your goals more easily. That\u2019s all.\u201dWhatever the reason, my proposal was a great opportunity for Asher.There was no way for her now to have a better plan than borrowing the prestige of a Lord.Asher\u2019s eyebrows narrowed. It was a sign of deep distress.Further words would be unreasonable, so I quietly sipped my tea while waiting for an answer.After being silent for a while, she opened her mouth.\u201cIf you want to make me your subordinate, you can do as you wish, but why are you making such an offer and seeking my approval, for the matter?\u201dA Lord could do as much as they liked by taking an apprentice knight as a subordinate without their consent.\u201cBecause I respect your wishes. Like I said, I\u2019m not threatening you with your secret. If you have other better plan, you can decline the offer.\u201dEven though I said that, I knew my offer was hard to refuse.The words \u2018secret\u2019 and \u2018better plan\u2019 were subtly inserted intending to pressure her a little.\u201c\u2026Last question, how did you know I belong to the White Moon tribe?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s part of my abilities.\u201dI succinctly dismissed the question.This was a world where magic, mysteries, and many abilities existed, so it was enough to pass it like that casually.Asher, who was looking at me with slightly dissatisfied eyes, said as if she finally decided.\u201cI accept the offer. I will become an escort knight for the Seventh Lord.\u201d\u2026Finally!I smiled inwardly in satisfaction.\u201cDid you say your name is Asher? Do you have a last name?\u201d\u201c\u2026Gronhilde.\u201dAsher hesitated before uttering her full name.\u201cMy name is Asher Gronhilde.\u201dAsher Gronhilde.The only survivor of the White Moon tribe.In the game, she served as a powerful helper for the player. And a character with the potential to become just as strong as the Lords of Calderic.Right now, she wouldn\u2019t fully trust me and would be wary, but she would stick with me from now on, so there\u2019s plenty of time to build trust.Anyway, with this, a reliable escort was obtained.It was time to head to the Seventh Lord\u2019s territory.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Caren would take care of it with no problems.After that, without delay, we prepared to leave for Enrock\u2014the Seventh Lord\u2019s territory.There was a hidden piece I could get on the way there.It was a rough terrain with many monsters, so I was worried about whether I should skip it, but now that Asher was my escort, I now had a solution.Why did so many people gather?I looked at the colorful four-wheeled carriage parked at the entrance of the castle.It\u2019s the one I would ride to Enrock.Many people around it, including knights, were already on horseback and waiting. It was the manpower of the Overlord.They asked me how should they prepare, so I told them to prepare however they wanted, and this was a procession that went beyond what I had imagined.\u201cThen, take care, Seventh Lord.\u201dChief of staff Dayphon said goodbye.The Overlord was away at the moment, so he came out to see me off instead.Good timing.I glanced at Asher, who was standing next to me.I thought it was rather fortunate that Asher had been secretly concerned about being noticed by the Overlord.If it was her, there would be nothing strange if she recognized Asher\u2019s level at once.In any case, it did not differ from stealing the castle\u2019s talent.Considering the Overlord\u2019s personality, she probably wouldn\u2019t care much, but still\u2026Anyway, even if she heard about it later, it\u2019s best to just take Asher from here now.\u201cAs for the coronation ceremony, if your change your mind, please let me know. If nothing special happens, then I\u2019ll see you at the next Lords\u2019 meeting.\u201dCoronation.I had already expressed my intention not to hold an official coronation ceremony.It was needlessly cumbersome, and I didn\u2019t want to be caught in the middle of the Lords again.I probably wouldn\u2019t see the Overlord or the other Lords again until the next council meeting. I was even thinking of avoiding it. Although that would probably be impossible.Until then, I have to raise my specs enough.At the next meeting, there was a high probability that they would assign me a task that would be difficult to avoid.The time was one year.At least until then, I had to do my best to raise my specs as much as possible.\u201cWe will set off.\u201dAfter getting on the carriage, the procession moved noisily.It was the beginning of a serious struggle.***From the capital of Dragore to the capital of Enrock\u2014it\u2019s like moving from the center of one country to another.Of course, it was a very long distance, so it would take a considerable amount of time to arrive while passing by many cities in the middle.It would be convenient and nice to just teleport there just like what Dayphon did in the convoy ship, but teleport in this world was not a convenient magic that one could use anytime, anywhere.Riding the wagon felt unfamiliar at first. But since humans were creatures of adaptation, I could adapt enough to the situation.Since the roads were not paved, the ride was uncomfortable. But not to the extent that it was unbearable.Other than that, the servants were prepared for meals and sleeping, so it was not too inconvenient.I quickly got used to it and killed boredom in my limited space\u2014reading books I brought with me or organizing and checking information on my notebook while idly looking at the scenery outside.It would have been much less boring if I had someone to talk to, but unfortunately, there wasn\u2019t one.Although there were many people around me, they were almost the same as being non-existent.Tup.I closed the book I was reading and looked at the seat opposite.Asher sat in an undisturbed posture with one hand close to the hilt of her sword.Unlike me, who was doing this and that, Asher spent the whole day in the carriage doing nothing, in that same state.I asked her, \u201cAren\u2019t you bored?\u201dAs if it was surprising that I asked such a question, Asher replied with a strange expression.\u201cIt\u2019s not boring.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll lend you a book to read.\u201d\u201cNo need, milord.\u201dA resolute refusal as if saying she would be faithful to her escort mission.And the conversation was over.I sighed inwardly and looked outside the carriage again.I\u2019d rather look at the wall and talk.I had the idea of having a conversation with Asher as we rode in the carriage together. As one could see, the result was something like this.No matter what I asked, what came back was a simple response, so it was difficult to continue the conversation.I was grateful that she was doing her duty diligently as an escort. But this was almost the same as having a stone statue riding with me.I knew she had this personality, but as expected, building closeness and trust with her in the future would be difficult.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe flow of my thoughts suddenly led to one place.About the hidden piece I needed to take care of before arriving at our destination.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Except for some races such as demons, humans had the most affinity for magic.Racial traits, as the name suggested, were a characteristic possessed by a particular race.For humans, it was the affinity for magical power, for beastmen, physical ability, and for dwarves, dexterity.In addition, it was not simply being excellent at a particular field, but there were also unique characteristics that only that race possessed, such as the power over spirits handled by the elves, the blood skills of vampires, and the white magic of the White Moon tribe.Last, mystery.Mystery was an unidentified power whose source was unknown.Because it was extremely rare, very few people owned it, and some mysteries were even so powerful that it just made no sense.On Earth, magical powers and racial traits were all supernatural powers beyond common sense, but in the concept of this world, mysteries were probably the one considered as \u2018supernatural powers\u2019.The most important part was this.It\u2019s just these mysteries were very difficult to find, but once you found it and get it, anyone could use it without conditions.In short, it was the most suitable and almost the only way to improve my abilities in a short period.The hidden piece I planned to find on my way to my destination was also a mystery.Super regeneration.A healing type of mystery that amplified the body\u2019s regenerative power.The mystery of super regeneration was location deep in the Rutus Mountains, where the city of Jenix was, on the border of the Overlord\u2019s territory.We haven\u2019t even reached the first city yet, so it\u2019s a long way to Jenix.In fact, going past Jenix was a bit of a detour, but if I could get that mystery, then it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal if my arrival was delayed.There\u2019s no need to worry too much.I glanced at Asher again.Until I found the place where the super regeneration was hidden, it was her job as an escort to make sure that the monsters on the mountain didn\u2019t touch me.Considering her level, there shouldn\u2019t be any problem.Even in such a situation, she was only focused on her job as an escort, so I didn\u2019t have to worry that she wouldn\u2019t do her job.Of course, that didn\u2019t mean that perfect safety was guaranteed. But this level of risk would happen more in the future, so I should get used to it.Still, if I started with super regeneration, I wonder if my life would be easier.It would have been much better if it was a defense-type of ability, but well, I had to take care of what I could get first.I looked out the window.Across the vast plain, I saw a series of mountain ranges like a picture. It was a wonderful natural scenery.***More time passed, and the carriage passed through several cities and finally arrived in Jenix City.Located at the foot of a mountain range, Jenix had a stronger fortress compared to other cities they passed by.\u201cHaving the Seventh Lord visit out humble city is an honor for us.\u201dJenix\u2019s mayor was a middle-aged human male.He seemed much more calm than the mayor of the previous city, who groaned and spit out many praises.I walked with him and asked.\u201cWho in this city is the best in the geography of Rutus Mountains?\u201dThe mayor pondered with a mixed expression of doubt, then answered cautiously,\u201cUnfortunately, I don\u2019t know who is the best\u2026 but I think the adventurers of the Adventurer\u2019s Guild know the geography of the mountain range.\u201d\u201cI need a guide to go deep into the mountains. Find someone suitable, whether it be an adventurer or someone else.\u201dI remember where the mystery of super regeneration was hidden.However, I didn\u2019t have the confidence to go there with no proper guide.Inevitably, there would be a big difference between the map seen through the computer monitor and the real world.This world was a game, but it was now my reality.The specifications of the field itself were different when playing the game.The overall map size of most games was unrealistically small compared to reality. So much so that one could move from one area to another on foot.That was a just a natural setting in the game since it was impossible to make the player take a year to travel.I always needed to keep this difference in mind.Just as it took a long time to get from the Overlord\u2019s castle to this place, Jenix, the actual size of this continent would be thousands of times much bigger than in the game.Since it was completely unknown what terrain or objects would fill the gap between them, a guide would be absolutely necessary.There\u2019s no way the location of the hidden piece will be different.It wasn\u2019t just the terrain; it was a problem with the setting of the game.I added to the mayor.\u201cIf anyone knows of a \u2018huge hourglass-shaped rock\u2019 located deep in the mountains north of the city, be sure to bring them.\u201dHourglass rock was a sure signpost to find the mystery.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Khan wasn\u2019t also at a low level, so they couldn\u2019t tire of hiking like this, but I was different.So, whenever I ran out of strength, I had no choice but to take a break like this, pretending to enjoy the surrounding scenery.If they even saw him panting unsightly, the Lord\u2019s authority would fall to the ground.It would have been nice if this damn body was above average\u2026Still, I wasn\u2019t the only one suffering, so I stopped complaining.Khan, who was working hard as a guide, looked stiff even at a glance from earlier.My existence was quite burdensome, but even that was much better than when we started.I got it. He probably would have never imagined that in his life as an adventurer he would one day guide a Lord.\u201cHow far into the mountains have we gone?\u201dI suddenly became curious and asked Khan.I remember that some powerful monsters also inhabited the depths of Rutus Mountains.\u201cI\u2019ve never been a to a deep place. There were many ferocious monsters, so it\u2019s a dangerous place for me.\u201d\u201cWhat monsters have you encountered?\u201d\u201cThe one I remember the most was a giant bear. But it\u2019s not a normal bear. It\u2019s because it had sharp spikes sticking all over its body.\u201dHe meant Spike Bear.As I asked about this and that, the tension seemed to have eased up, and Khan talked a lot. Originally, he had a talkative personality.\u201cAnd there\u2019s also a crazy rumor going around lately. An adventurer said he saw an absurdly gigantic snake in the mountains to the north.\u201dGiant snake?If it\u2019s to the north, then it would be somewhere here.\u201cThere was a time when that adventurer made a fuss about how no one would stop such a monster coming down to the city, that it would be a mess in no time, and that we would have to call the Overlord\u2019s Castle for reinforcements when it happened.\u201d\u201cWhat happened next?\u201d\u201cFirst, the mayor listened and said that they would form an investigation team with the adventurer\u2019s guild, but of course, most don\u2019t believe it. According to the story, it\u2019s a snake that\u2019s much bigger than the city walls, but Rutus Mountains aren\u2019t a demonic place. Would it make sense for that kind of monster to be here?\u201dA snake bigger than the walls of the fortress-like city of Jenix.A list of snake-type monsters flashed through my head.Among them, only one came to mind.\u2026Bellevagorah?He\u2019s not in a green mountain range like this, but a named boss that actually lived in the Devil\u2019s Realm.I wondered if I was just thinking too much and it was just a normal species of giant snake?Do giant snakes even appear in the Rutus Mountains?Well, in reality, only certain monsters appeared in certain areas.Giant snakes lived in forest areas, so it wouldn\u2019t be strange for it to appear here.If it\u2019s a full adult, its basic level would be at level 50, so it\u2019s a sufficiently catastrophic monster by normal standards.But even if we actually ran into it, it probably wouldn\u2019t be a problem.We had an even bigger on our side\u2014Asher.And the chance of us bumping into such a monster in this vast mountain range would probably be low\u2026Rustle.Then the nearby bushes shook, and something appeared.[Lv.22]A wolf.Its belly was larger than normal, and at the end of its long tail was something thick and pointed like a mace. Flail Wolf.Khan put his hand on the hilt of his sword with a nervous face.With its gaze fixed on this side, the wolf had turned its tail and let out a low cry before charging towards us.A flash of blue light split it in half.Scattered blood. The chunk of meat, neatly cut in two, rolled across the ground and scattered noisily.I blinked and looked at the corpse, then moved my gaze to the side.With an expressionless face, I could see Asher putting back the sword she had pulled out.Khan, half stunned, looked back and forth between the half-cut corpse and Asher.I pretended nothing was wrong.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cAh, yes\u2026\u201dAfter all, there was no need to worry about monsters.Because a strong escort was with them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They were monsters called Armor Boar, whose whole body was as hard as armor\u2026Chow!As Asher swung her sword, the huge sword energy that spread horizontally cut them all in one blow. It stained the forest with blood.She was playing the role of an escort perfectly.If none of the monsters we encountered came within five meters of me.I asked Khan.\u201cDo you encounter monsters this often every time you climb the mountain?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t run into them that often. Usually, I\u2019m strictly vigilant so that I don\u2019t run into them.\u201dKhan explained that if he saw even an ominous sign, he retreated or turn in a different direction.It meant that he was only going straight, regardless of whether he found a trail. He probably realized that there\u2019s no reason to be careful after seeing Asher\u2019s strength. It would be just a waste of time.We arrived at the bottom of a cliff by the time the sun rose in mid-sky.It was a cliff high enough to be dozens of meters high, but Khan spat out absurd words.\u201cIf you go up here and move a little further, we will arrive at our destination.\u201dWhat?I looked at him, wondering what kind of bullshit he was saying, and Khan only smiled awkwardly.\u201cOh, I\u2019m fine. It\u2019s a terrain with many places to step on, and I\u2019m used to it because I\u2019ve already climbed this kind of height once or twice.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dNo, I\u2019m not worried about you, I\u2019m worried about me.I looked up at the cliff.I forgot about it for a while but for the superhumans in this world, climbing a cliff with no gears was no big deal.The cliff was not a blocked road, but a path that could only be climbed.\u201c\u2026Is this the only path?\u201d\u201cYes? If we look for it, there might be another way, but it\u2019s a long way back. Then, I\u2019ll go up first.\u201dKhan said that and moved first.The other probably didn\u2019t think that I wouldn\u2019t be able to climb this much.Should I have brought a wizard as well?Khan clung to the wall like a lizard and started climbing the cliff quickly.I looked at him in dismay, then moved my gaze to Asher.\u2026Not that it came to this, there\u2019s no helping it.\u201cAsher.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cCarry me up.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201dAsher looked back with a doubtful expression, as if she was not sure if she heard me correctly.I said it again as boldly as possible.\u201cI told you to carry me up.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThere was silence for a while.She had a complicated expression on her face, showing that she couldn\u2019t understand the intention of the order, but soon she knelt down and gave her back to me obediently.Cooong!And it took only a moment for us to arrive at the top.It was because her body rose as if it exploded with just one cloud of footsteps, and we reached the top of the cliff without even stepping on the wall.Most rides had a dizzying speed and the sense that your stomach was being emptied, but somehow I could withstand that and prevent myself from screaming.\u2026Uh.I didn\u2019t want to do that twice.I calmed down the tingling aftertaste and got off Asher\u2019s back.Looking down, Khan was about a third of the way up. I thought he could come up soon.If Asher helped him, he could arrive here quickly. But since it\u2019s weird to ask Asher that again, I just waited.\u201c\u2026\u201dAsher stared somewhere.I reflexively looked where her gaze was directed, but there was nothing.Instantly, the fishy smell stung my nostrils.The smell of blood\u2026?It was a bloody scent that I could easily recognize.Soon after, Khan, who arrived at the top, also looked around, shaking off the dust from his clothes, as if he also smelled the scent. He even commented;\u201cIt looks like there are some dead bodies of monsters nearby.\u201dWe continued to move.The further into the forest, the stronger the scent of blood. We seemed to get closer to the source.When we reached a certain point, everyone was at a loss for words at the sight unfolding in front of us.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe identity of the corpse was that of a huge snake.A huge snake with a gray coat, the size of a head and the length of a human body. It was, without a doubt, a giant snake.What stood out what that it was dead.The middle of the torso was cut off\u2026 No, it wasn\u2019t cut off, but the middle of the torso was completely gone.It was as if something much bigger than itself had eaten it in one bite.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Because it\u2019s dead.Who killed it?I looked around.As I looked for traces as I did a quick sweep of the nearby ground, a strange scene of fallen trees was reflected.Zwik.A faint sound echoed in my ears for a moment.The ground shook with the eerie sound that seemed to stimulate life\u2019s instinctive fear.The overgrown bushes on one side collapsed, and something huge came toward us. Still, no one could move.Coo coo coo.Before long, the overwhelming presence raised its body and cast a shadow on the ground.Both Asher and Khan looked at \u2018it\u2019 with shocked faces.[Lv.90]It was a huge, dark snake.It would not be strange to say that it was not a snake but a dragon, a snake that was definitely gigantic enough to make the dead giant snake seemed like a newborn baby snake.I was well aware of its identity.Bellevagorah.One of the named bosses of the Demon realm.The first thing I thought of when I heard the story of the giant snake, but I honestly believed that it would not be in a place like this.Why the hell are you here?The answer to the question came right away.This was the five years into the past before the game started.It hadn\u2019t moved to the demon realm yet.That\u2019s right\u2026 if that was the case, then it actually made sense. I just never imagined that the giant snake of the rumors would really be this guy.Zwik.A huge, torn pupil came out and scanned the other two.It was as if it was contemplating which food to try first.Khan had a face that seemed like he would faint at any moment, and Asher was no different.Far from preparing for battle, her face turned white, and I could see that the hand holding the sword hilt was shaking. Just like a frog before a snake.Is this\u2026 \u2018Fear\u2019?Some monsters had a kind of \u2018Fear\u2019 ability that caused extreme fear and panic in weaker targets. Bellevagorah was one of them.No matter how strong Asher was, there was no choice but to be greatly influenced by the \u2018Fear\u2019 of the opponent with a much higher level.Even if one fought in perfect condition, they wouldn\u2019t be able to run properly when there was no chance of winning.Because I had the [Soul of a King], \u2018Fear\u2019 did not affect me.Still, it didn\u2019t change that the situation was the worst.How could I quickly become out of luck?I promised to take a certain risk, but it\u2019s already a crisis like this. I seriously wanted to laugh at this dumbfounding situation.\u2026As long as I could touch it somehow.I knew I had no choice but to survive in this situation.I only needed one contact.It would be the end if I died from being crushed by that gigantic body before I had the time to activate my skill. But he had no choice but to risk his life.I walked slowly towards Bellevagorah.***An overwhelming size that left one speechless.It was absurd that she didn\u2019t even feel its presence, even though I was right next to it.Asher knew for the first time at this moment that such a gigantic creature existed in the world.She also instinctively felt that even if she fought it with all her might, she could never win.No, she couldn\u2019t even fight right now.I can\u2019t move my body\u2026My breath stopped just by facing it. It\u2019s hard to even lift a finger.She gnashed her teeth and resisted \u2018Fear\u2019. She did everything in her power to straighten out the fighting spirit that was about to be broken.But she still couldn\u2019t pull out her sword.The fear that engulfed her from the depths of her heart couldn\u2019t be shaken off, no matter what.All she could do was feel hopeless and helpless and desperately raised her magical power to free herself from the bondage.It was then.The sound of footsteps breaking the silence.Her eyes widened.The Seventh Lord was slowly approaching the monster.With a light step like as if this terrible pressure had no effect on him.The monster tilted its head and slowly lowered its head.The slightest movement raised wind pressure and made the ground tremble.It was as if it was wondering why there was a prey that could move casually.A distance close enough to touch if you stretch out your hand.The Seventh Lord standing right in front of the monster looked like he was in danger, as if it would suck him in if it opened its mouth and breathed in.The Seventh Lord slowly reached out his hand.To Asher, it was a calm gesture that did not contain any murderous intent or energy. And the moment his fingertips touched the monster, he smiled and said softly.\u201cDid I look like your prey?\u201d\u2026.Cooooong!!!The huge body of the monster collapsed with a huge vibration.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I had to say that I was really lucky.When I finally made contact safely, the ecstasy rose to the point of nonsense.Even when I was on the verge of death, I still had that kind of composure. My mind must have gone twisted somewhere because of the [Soul of the King].\u201cUgh\u2026 uh\u2026\u201dHearing that limp moan, I turned to where the two were.I saw Khan slumped on the floor with a face that seemed like his soul was drained.Asher stood with her eyes wide open, staring blankly at me. She was finally released from the effects of \u2018Fear\u2019.The atmosphere was engulfed in silence, so I said nothing.\u201cIt\u2019s a monster that wasn\u2019t supposed to be in a place like this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThere was no clear response.Khan was almost exhausted because of shock and fear. So, he continued moving after taking a break for a while.\u201cSorry.\u201dWhile I was sitting on a rock and looking at Bellevagorah\u2019s corpse, Asher said something out of the blue.I turned my head and looked at her.Basically, Asher\u2019s expressionless face made it difficult to read her emotions, but I clearly saw that the other had a sullen expression.After thinking about what she apologized for all of a sudden, I realized.Is she saying that she failed to escort me properly?This was a completely unexpected disaster.It was far beyond her ability, so there was no reason to blame her.How could she deal with a monster that a Lord could only deal or someone of the same level?However, she could not tolerate that she did not fulfil her responsibilities properly. She just had that kind of personality.Asher was a person who had that kind of stubbornness, serious in everything and infinitely strict with herself.Ah.. or is it because of that?Perhaps it was the shock of not being able to resist even the slightest in front of Bellevagorah.I opened my mouth.\u201cSome monsters and species that emit \u2018Fear\u2019 are rare.\u201dAsher blinked.A reaction showing that she didn\u2019t understand what I was trying to say. She probably also didn\u2019t know about \u2018Fear\u2019.\u2018Fear\u2019 was a kind of ability that had little information about because monsters that had it were rare.At her level, even if she met other monsters that emitted \u2018Fear\u2019, she probably would not have been affected at all.So it was unreasonable if this unfamiliar experience hurt her pride.\u201cIt is an ability that causes fear, especially in opponents weaker than oneself. Usually, they completely lose the will to fight and fall into a panic.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah.\u201dOnly then did Asher look back at Bellevagorah\u2019s corpse as if surprised.\u201cYou probably never experienced it before.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThat little creature was so powerful that it was rare to see even in the Demonic Realm.\u201dAt the words of consolation, Asher looked a little taken aback.She nodded her head without answering, then closed her mouth again and returned to silence. So, it\u2019s hard to know what she was thinking.Soon, Khan also came back to his senses.\u201cIf you\u2019re not feeling well, get some more rest.\u201d\u201cOh, no. I\u2019m really sorry for bothering you.\u201dKhan seemed exhausted, but seemed to have recovered enough to move his body.Since he was exposed to the \u2018Fear\u2019 of a level 90 monster, it\u2019s already good that he did not faint.Perhaps this was just a short hike in his adventurer\u2019s life, but he wondered if it would be one of the most memorable adventure for him.\u201cIf something like that had really come down to the city, it would have been ruined\u2026\u201dAs if he still couldn\u2019t feel the reality, Khan muttered blankly as he looked at Bellevagorah\u2019s corpse.Then, as he turned his head this way, his eyes met mine, and for some reason, he flinched excessively and lowered his head.\u2026Wasn\u2019t his expression the same one he had when he first saw Bellevagorah?Are you treating me as a monster?It was not an incomprehensible reaction.In their eyes, it would have looked like I killed the monster just by touching it.Asher was pretending to be okay, but she was still secretly glancing at the corpse.Anyway, since the crisis had safely passed, it was time to complete my purpose for coming here.\u201cLet\u2019s move.\u201dAll around, thick black trees were coloring the forest dark.The hidden piece was close at hand.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was a much lower cliff than the one we climbed earlier.It seems like it was roughly that way\u2026 isn\u2019t it? Is it over there?I looked around and guessed the direction.However, my memory was ambiguous, and I was confused when I saw it in person, so I decided to just check it carefully.I wandered around the base of the cliff, carefully examining everything.The two followed me without saying a word, with faces that didn\u2019t know what they were doing.After several tens of minutes, I found a fine crack on one side of the wall that was vertically split at a height similar to mine.I could feel the faint chill seeping from the crack.\u201cAsher.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cBreak this gap moderately wide.\u201dAsher looked at the gap I pointed out and raised her hand, saying nothing.I took a slight step back.Kwaaang!The wall crumbled as energy burst from her palm pressed against the crack.The inside of the chasm was hollow, like a cave, with an entrance large enough for one or two people to enter.Asher and Khan widened their eyes at the appearance of the hidden passage.\u201cWait here.\u201dLeaving the two at the entrance, I went inside alone. The air was cold.The passage led down a gentle slope, but as soon as I descended a little, the light from outside could no longer be seen, and I quickly lost sight of anything ahead.At that moment, I took out a glowstone I had brought.When I unwrapped the tightly wrapped cloth wrapping the stone, a bright white light spread and the surrounding instantly became brighter.\u201c\u2026Uh.\u201dBugs attached to the wall of the cave also appeared. There were quite a few things, like cockroaches and centipedes.He clicked his tongue once and continued to move forward.As the slope gradually continued downhill, I had to take my steps carefully.When I finally reached the point where I couldn\u2019t go down without touching the ground with my hands, I broke out in a cold sweat.If I slipped, I\u2019d be done for.Was the slope here originally in this shape? How much deeper would this slope be until I reached my destination?I put the glowstone I was holding in my mouth and touched the ground with both hands.It was fortunate that the ground was bumpy, so there was plenty of space to step on.As long as it doesn\u2019t get steeper than this, I won\u2019t fall unless I stumble stupidly\u2026\u201cAh!\u201dIn an instant, my feet slipped on the ground, and my body collapsed.Fuck. Why did it have to be a flag as soon as I said it?I desperately touched the floor with my hands, but it was enough.My body rolled down the slope like a wheel into the darkness.Cooong!The fall stopped only after I felt a terrifying shock to my head and arms.I wriggled for a while, then I got up. My whole body throbbed, and I felt a fishy taste in my mouth.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dI felt like something was flowing down my face.When I wiped it off, my hands were soaked in red. It was blood.With a distorted expression, I wiped the blood from my chin and looked down at my left arm.Likewise, it was so tattered and covered in blood that I could barely even move it. It might even look like it was broken.It was the first time I had ever been hurt this badly, so I was embarrassed for a moment, but it soon subsided coldly.The sharp pain stabbing my arm was excruciatingly painful, but my reason was not disturbed, as always.After a moment of heavy breathing, I stumbled and looked around.At the end of the downhill, I saw a small aisle bent to the side. Did it open like that after I hit it from rolling down?It was a far short reward for my body being in disrepair, but I descended the slope in an instant, anyway.I picked up the glowstone with my free arm and walked into the aisle.A tingling pain came up every time I stepped on my right foot, as if I had sprained my ankle, but not that painful that I couldn\u2019t walk.As I progressed, the aisle gradually widened, and a faint green light leaked from the inside.\u201cWow.\u201dWhen I finally reached the end, I spit out a short admiration at the unfolding scenery.A wide and empty cavity, with a green pattern engraved on the floor in the middle, emitting a soft light.I forgot the pain and smiled brightly as I limped towards the pattern.I knew what it was, so I didn\u2019t hesitate to approach it.I finally found it. Mystery of super regeneration.It\u2019s bigger than I thought.The mysterious pattern was close to a circle like a magic circle, but it was so large that it was several meters in diameter.Approaching it, I just stared down at it for a while.I found it, but I didn\u2019t know how to get this mystery.In the game, a message would pop up saying that once you found it and got close to it, you could get the mystery on its own.Can I just touch it?There was no other way, so I got down on one knee and stretched my hand towards the pattern.Hwaak!Then, the light of the pattern burst brightly for an instant.I panicked and almost let go, then stopped.It\u2019s because the light climbed up my hand that touched it and was absorbed into my body.Soon all the light was absorbed, and the pattern disappeared without a trace. The cavity sank into darkness.\u201c\u2026\u201dFeeling a little bewildered, I removed my hand from the floor and looked down at my left arm.Broken wounds were healing and regenerating in an instant.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The same for the head wound and the sprained ankle.The body, which had been damaged until just a moment ago, returned to its normal state in an instant.\u201cWhat a cheat.\u201dIndeed, it was an ability worthy of the name \u2018super regeneration\u2019.Suddenly, curiosity arose. With this level, could severed body parts be regenerated?Super regeneration in the game was just a passive skill that amplified the recovery of HP. Whether severed body parts were regenerated, it did not show it.However, that didn\u2019t mean that I would cut off a part of my intact body just to check it out. I was just curious.In any case, the first mystery was successfully obtained.Feeling refreshed, I picked up the glowstone and stood up.Although the wounds had healed, the bloodstains on it were still there.I couldn\u2019t go outside in this state, so I washed away the bloodstains with a canteen of water. And it soaked into my clothes.The walls and the ground of the cavity were full of bugs, just like the passage through here.As I looked at them, another thought came to my mind.\u201c\u2026\u201dI narrowed my eyes and looked alternately at the blood and insects that had fallen on the floor.Instant kill.The only attack skill I had.It was described as a skill that could kill any target once I contacted it.The question that came to my mind was this.What exactly did this \u2018contact\u2019 mean?Until now, it was only natural to think of it as contact through the body.However, if one thought about it carefully, they need to consider how far the standard of this \u2018body\u2019 was.For example, blood was also part of the body.Then, was the target that came into contact with my blood also within the range of instant kill?\u2026I definitely need to experiment.I picked up a bug that was crawling under my feet.Then, after putting the bug back on the spot where my blood fell, I activated [Instant Kill].However, the bug did not die and was still alive.I was a little disappointed with the results that were out of my expectations, and I thought of other possibilities.Maybe it\u2019s because the blood had been discharged from the body for a long time.\u201cWell, let\u2019s test it.\u201dI found a sharp piece of stone on the ground and picked it up.I could heal even broken bones in an instant, so cuts were no longer a big deal.When I pressed the palm of my hand with the crude blade, the flesh tore open and blood flowed out. The wound immediately regenerated.I dripped the blood from my palm on the insects crawling on the floor.Then, when I activated [Instant Kill] again, to my surprise\u2026\u201cHa\u2026\u201dThey all died.The bugs no longer wriggled and moved. It\u2019s the same even if I poked it my finger.This time, it was real instant death.I tried a few more times with different bugs, to be sure. The results were all the same.Only then was I convinced that my guess was correct.I can trigger instant kill not only through skin contact but also through blood.However, it\u2019s assumed that there was a time limit, as the blood that had bled out of the body for quite a while had no effect.Exactly how long it was was still unknown, but anyway, this was a pretty awesome discovery.I never thought I could use it this way\u2026If blood could be used as a medium for instant kill, the ways to use it become endless.I turned around, thinking that once I reached Enrock, I\u2019d have to do a more accurate experiment.When I went back through the passage and went out of the cave, I saw Asher and Khan standing side by side at the entrance.The two of them gave me a startled expression.I felt a little embarrassed because I knew very well that my clothes were torn, bloodstained, and dusty, and my appearance was a mess.I tried my best to say calmly;\u201cLet\u2019s go back.\u201d***Asher walked behind the Seventh Lord. She glanced at his back, especially at his left arm.Blood soaked the torn sleeve red.There were no visible injuries and serious marks.\u2026What the hell happened?It was the Seventh Lord who turned even the monster, which was so huge that it could even be mistaken as a dragon, into a cold corpse in an instant. So, it\u2019s hard to believe that he was just in a fierce battle.Overwhelming strength that truly deviated from reason.But what was the identity of the cave, and what happened inside, so that he suffered such an aftermath?Even if she thought it was just useless curiosity, she couldn\u2019t help but pay attention to it.The Seventh Lord was someone who was hard to figure out.This hike made it even harder to understand what purpose he had, let alone figure it out.She wondered if the only thing she learned a little about was his personality.From the way he had a casual conversation with the person who accompanied them as a guide, he didn\u2019t particularly care about status or rank.He also seemed to hate moving his body roughly.It was like that when she thought of how he stopped moving and leisurely looked at the scenery whenever he had a chance.Especially when they had to climb the cliff. He even had to borrow her back. No, no matter how much she thought about it, she still couldn\u2019t understand his intentions.He\u2019s a mysterious person.As they reached the cliff they had climbed earlier, the Seventh Lord looked back this way.\u201cAsher.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cPick me up and go down.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dShe really couldn\u2019t understand.Asher decided to no longer think deeply about the other\u2019s eccentricity in the future.***The return to the city took much less time than when they climbed up the mountain range.It was only natural since going downhill was faster, but besides that, there was also the effect of my super regeneration.This was because super regeneration amplified not only the regenerative power of the body but also the physical strength, so I rarely felt tired. Unexpectedly, even the stamina issue was solved.After returning to the city, Khan received a big pay as promised and they told the mayor about the monster.\u201cIt\u2019s a giant snake that appeared in the northern mountains.\u201d\u201cAh, yes. I\u2019m planning to dispatch an investigation team because there are rumors like that\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s already dead. Just take care of its body.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201dAfter that, there was nothing more to see or do, so I left Jenix City right away.Soon after, the wagon entered the territory of the Seventh Lord, Enrock, and quickly headed for the capital, passing through several cities again. And\u2026Finally, arrived!I stared at the massive city walls that appeared in the distance.Excluding the Overlord\u2019s Castle, it was the tallest and most massive wall of any city I had ever passed.The capital of the Seventh Lord\u2019s territory\u2014Buckhorn.We finally arrived at our destination.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What kind of useless waste of manpower was this?After passing through the front gate, I got off the carriage.The two people who greeted me at the front were an elf wearing luxurious clothes and an old man with gray hair who looked like a butler at first glance.The elf greeted me politely.\u201cGreetings to Enrock\u2019s new master. I am Baslan, who was the regent of the territory.\u201dRegent? Was there anything like that?There was no way that they would leave the seat of the Lord empty, so something like a regent was only natural when I thought about it.I thought the other would explain this and that while guiding me to the castle, but the words that followed were unexpected.\u201cI was waiting to see and greet the Seventh Lord before I returned to the Overlord Castle.\u201d\u201c\u2026Return?\u201d\u201cYes, I am originally an administrator belonging to the Overlord\u2019s Castle. I was dispatched here under the command of the Overlord and acted as the regent.\u201dOh, was it like that?He was an official with a high enough ranking to take the place of a Lord.The old man next to him also came forward and introduced himself.\u201cI\u2019m Floto, the butler of the castle.The real guide was this one.The elf immediately left the castle, and I entered the central hall of the castle, following Floto\u2019s guidance.The interior was exactly what I had imagined.A typical landscape that came to mind when talking about a castle in a fantasy world. Spacious, splendid, majestic.\u201cThe banquet is ready, my lord.\u201dI nodded.Originally, I would have rejected it. But\u2026A day or so would be fine.It\u2019s not like I would leave the castle right away anyway, and it seemed like the other had already prepared everything. If I rejected it, I would ignore the effort made by the servants.And since I had to look at the faces of the servants of the castle at least once, the banquet was, to some extent, was something that I just had to do.\u2026Honestly, it\u2019s all excuses. I\u2019m human too. So, I also wanted to take a break for a while. Because I had a hard time getting here.With the mindset to work hard again from tomorrow, I enjoyed a comfortable rest today.***A huge mansion on the outskirts of Buckhorn City.It was the building of the Varia Merchant Corps, which completely dominated and monopolized the upper road from the northern border of Enrock to Buckhorn.Two men were sitting opposite each other in the upper living room, talking.\u201cSo, what about the information about the new Seventh Lord, Brother?\u201dAt the words of the man wearing an eyepatch, the dignified man shook his head.He was Varia, the owner of the merchant company.\u201cThere\u2019s no particular gain. From what I\u2019ve heard, he\u2019s a complete outsider. And he\u2019s human. Have you seen his face at the parade?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve seen a glimpse from a distance. He\u2019s quite pale.\u201d\u201cBark, even if there are no ears around to hear, I always told you to watch your mouth.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only the two of us anyway, so it\u2019s okay to talk comfortably.\u201dBark grumbled lightly.\u201cThis is a good situation for us. Those tenacious alchemists are now without a windshield.\u201dAlkimas Workshop.An old group of alchemists in Buckhorn City.Many efforts had been made for a long time now to get them out. But with the vacancy of the Seventh Lord\u2019s seat, it came to nothing for a while.For the past few years, the newly dispatched regent managed the city strictly.Of course, bribes didn\u2019t work.However, with crowning of the new Lord, the situation had changed.There were the ones who reigned at the highest level.The competition for power and interests of those lower was nothing more than a fight between worms to them, so they cared little. Just like the previous Seventh Lord did.As long as the new Seventh Lord was not a lunatic like the Tyrant or the Black Sea Empress, the situation would turn in favor of the upper ranks again.\u201cI\u2019ll have to visit the workshop tomorrow.\u201d\u201cAre you going to pressure them right away?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true that the situation is in our favor, but we still don\u2019t know what kind of character the Seventh Lord has. It\u2019s best to make those people from Alkimas to raise the white flag on their own as quickly as possible.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. The workshop owner and the elders must have their pants twisted by now.\u201dVaria and Bark smiled evilly at each other.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And every time it succeeded, five seconds would delay the activation time.After sacrificing dozens of caterpillars, I completed the experiment.About three minutes.As a result of the experiment, the effective time for instant kill using my blood was about three minutes.Blood that had flowed out of the body for over three minutes could not activate [Instant Kill].The first thing that came to my mind while contemplating how to use this newfound knowledge was the vampire blood technique.If I had the ability to freely manipulate blood, the synergy with [Instant Kill] would be truly amazing.The problem is that I can\u2019t change my race.There was usually no way to change the race one was born with in this world.Even if I could change it, I wanted to remain human as much as possible.A way to use blood magic even if I was not a vampire.There was one thing that came to mind, but it was a way that had considerable risk.Let\u2019s put it behind my mind for now.Anyway, I got the information I needed, but there was still a lot I didn\u2019t know.For example, what was the range of targets that could be instantly killed? Would instant kill work on the undead, as well as spiritual bodies?These, too, should be checked later when the opportunity arose.The next thing to deal with now was the Alkimas Workshop issue.I said to Asher, who was waiting outside the room.\u201cI need to go out for a while.\u201dI was curious about how effective the potions in this world were, and I also wanted to look at the workshop.***Aria was an apprentice alchemist at the Alkimas Workshop.Her morning job was to work at the counter in the store building.The workshop\u2019s main source of income was the city councils of nearby cities, including Buckhorn, and other adventurers as well.The city council rarely came to the store directly because they made bulk purchases.And adventurers were not yet active at this time of the day.In short, Aria was having a leisurely time, as there were few guests.Aria, who was yawning, saw the figure of a customer who just entered the store.She hastily shut her mouth.The guests were a young man and a woman. She looked like an escort. The two were both very attractive, especially the man.Aria greeted brightly, thinking that her eyes were blessed so early in the morning.\u201cWelcome!\u201dThe man silently nodded and looked at the potions on display.Is he a young master from another city?It was a face she hadn\u2019t seen before.The man, who had been looking at the potions for quite some time, came closer to the counter.\u201cAre all the potions you have currently on display?\u201d\u201cAh, all the potions on display are below average quality. High-quality potions are usually made-to-order.\u201dThe man nodded and asked again.\u201cI want to buy the highest quality healing potion in the workshop.\u201dAt that, Aria laughed inwardly.Apparently, this ignorant young master didn\u2019t know how expensive the product was, especially the potion made by Alkimas.\u201cIf you are talking about the highest quality healing potion, there is \u2018Scarlet\u2019.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that the name of the workshop owner?\u201d\u201cYes, since it was a potion invented by the owner, that is how it was named.\u201d\u201cHow much?\u201dAria replied with a bright smile, thinking of teasing the other a little.\u201cThree platinum coins.\u201dIn terms of gold coins, a whopping 300 coins.It was an amount that couldn\u2019t be readily purchased with a light heart.Aria looked at the man\u2019s face, expecting a shocked reaction.But he just nodded his head without a change in his expression.\u201cI will buy it.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s made to order, how long will I have to wait? Can I pay the full amount in advance?\u201dSaying that, the man took out a purse full of gold and platinum coins from his bosom.Aria couldn\u2019t close her wide-open mouth in shock, then she stuttered.\u201cNow, wait! I\u2019ll bring the workshop owner right away!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Al that level, he was quite capable.Scarlett, who found me, strode towards me and greeted me right away.\u201cI\u2019m Scarlett Artima, the workshop owner.\u201dIt was a tired voice with haggard eyes.Even in the game, it was not surprising to remember her as a character who was half crazy about alchemy research.\u201cI\u2019ve heard the story. Are you planning to buy Scarlet?\u201dI knew it was the name of the potion, but somehow it sounded strange.I nodded.\u201cDo I have to pay the whole amount now?\u201d\u201cNo, you just have to pay half the price in advance. Rather, I came here to explain the potion\u2019s efficacy\u2026\u201dShe put on a strange expression, as if my attitude to purchase without asking was strange.\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, may I ask you where you are from?\u201d\u201cShould I tell you?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s unnecessary, but it\u2019s better to have a clear identity. First, it\u2019s an item that I invented, so you can\u2019t blame me for being wary.\u201dShe must be wondering if I was from a dangerous organization, or if I came from another workshop. She must be concerned about those.A person willing to pay a large sum of three platinum coins couldn\u2019t be just an ordinary customer.I thought for a while and then replied.\u201cShall we discuss your potion first?\u201d\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll treat you to tea, so let\u2019s sit down for a while.\u201dShe passed the topic with little concern and led me to a room in the main studio building.I came here with the intention of just observing, but somehow it ended up like this.I listened to Scarlett explain about the potion over tea.\u201cFirst, since it is basically a healing potion, its regenerative effect is very excellent. It is possible to attach parts that have been amputated as long as time has not passed. In addition, it can restore damage to the internal organs to some extent by drinking it. Of course, pouring it directly is much better and more effective.\u201d\u201cIs it impossible to completely regenerate the severed parts?\u201dAt my question, Scarlett looked at me with a slightly absurd expression.\u201cEven if it\u2019s an elixir, that would be hard to do.\u201dElixir was the name given to some of the best potions on the continent. In short, she was telling me not to talk nonsense.\u201cHow long will it take to fully heal a broken bone?\u201dI asked this question because I wanted to compare the effect of my super regeneration to her best potion.Scarlett replied.\u201cIt depends on the location of the broken bone and the severity, but in case of a finger fracture, it usually heals within a minute. For an arm or leg, it takes at least a few minutes.\u201dAs expected, my super regeneration was much better.\u201cOther side effects include\u2026\u201dAs I listened to the explanation that followed, I was lost in my thoughts for a while.Scarlett was an excellent alchemist.I didn\u2019t know exactly what her skill level was now, but in the game\u2019s story, with her own ability, she could create an elixir.It meant that she was a talented person with the potential to develop that much in the future, even if she could not reach it right now. There was nothing wrong with keeping the kite together.Scarlett\u2019s first appearance in the game was with the crumbling of Alkimas Workshop.It was because the Varia Merchant Corps, who coveted the workshop\u2019s potions and Scarlett\u2019s ability, did several dirty tricks.Didn\u2019t they say that they are almost monopolizing Enrock\u2019s northern merchants?I asked Floto, the head butler, to get all the details.Even though Alkimas was a historic workshop in the capital, such as capital and connections, they were far behind Varia.According to the known future, after this, Alkimas would be half absorbed by them and would be completely tied up to them.And originally, as the story progressed, the player\u2019s performance would safely restore her identity, but\u2026Now I just have to solve it.It was too simple to do with my current influence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

By the way\u2026\u201dScarlett seemed to hesitate, she said.\u201cTo be honest, I have a bottle of Scarlet already finished.\u201dI tilted my head.Didn\u2019t they say that high-quality potions were made in advance?She calmly explained the situation.\u201cI received a custom order from the mayor of Dartmad City just a while ago, but the deal fell through shortly.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cThey were deprived of their position and the monarchy confiscated all their property because of corruption. Of course, the advance payment that had been received during the transaction was recovered during the investigation of the funds. The potions were just added to our inventory, so it was difficult.\u201dOh.\u201cSo I can give you the finished potion right away, but if you don\u2019t want to receive it in advance, I\u2019ll make a new one.\u201d\u201cDo potions lose potency over time?\u201d\u201cI can guarantee that there will be no degradation in efficacy unless you had not used it for several years. I swear on my honor, as well as my workshop.\u201dI nodded.\u201cThen I\u2019ll take it.\u201dIt obviously surprised Scarlett when I accepted so easily.\u201cThank you, but are you really sure?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you ask me to buy it while bringing up a story that didn\u2019t have to be brought up?\u201dIf they really wanted to deal with their inventory somehow, she wouldn\u2019t have bothered to say this. Which meant that she only wanted to sell the potion.So we made a deal right on the spot.After a while, Scarlett brought the potion. The potion was bottled and sealed in a luxurious wooden box.After paying three platinum coins and taking the potion, I left the workshop, and we said our goodbyes.\u201cBy the way, didn\u2019t you say that you would let me know where you came from once you get the goods?\u201dOh, right.I stared at Scarlett and said.\u201cI\u2019ll see you soon, so let\u2019s put it off.\u201dAt my words, Scarlett\u2019s expression became incomprehensible, but she still nodded.I left the store and walked down the main street, taking the potion out of the box and examining it.A reddish liquid flowing in a glass bottle.Anyway, since I didn\u2019t need potions anymore, it was something I had no use for.But because of my curiosity, I still paid an exorbitant amount of money to buy this. After all, I now had a lot of money.Even if it wasn\u2019t for me, this potion might be something Asher could use later on, so I bought it as an emergency medicine.I\u2019d like to see the effect myself, but\u2026While I was walking with that thought in mind, I suddenly heard an urgent scream from somewhere.\u201cHelp me! Someone please!\u201dI looked in the direction from which the sound had come and saw two boys.The one being supported had blood dripping from his stomach as if he had been stabbed.However, passers-by looked at them and either ignored them or clicked their tongues.\u201cWhat kind of fuss is that again? Noisy!\u201d\u201cLooks like they\u2019re having fun since morning. Back alley parasite bastards.\u201d\u2026Ah, was this the case?I could roughly grasp the situation by listening to what people were saying nonchalantly.The one supporting was also not in good condition, so the two both fell to the ground as if he had lost his strength.He squeezed out his voice with all his remaining strength and called for help.\u201cHe\u2019s my brother! If anyone has a potion, please give it to me! If you help me, I won\u2019t forget the grace for the rest of my life, so please\u2026!\u201dSomeone laughed.\u201cIs that bastard crazy? He\u2019s going to die, anyway. What kind of idiot would give him their precious potion?\u201dNo one offered a helping hand to the earnest cry.While looking at the scene, Asher\u2019s expression suddenly caught my eye.Rarely, the expressionless expression was broken. She was looking at the two children with pity.Come to think of it, Asher also had a younger brother.During the invasion of Santea, one of the Five Stars killed her younger brother right in front of her eyes. I remembered it being set up like that.So, for her, it must have been a more unfortunate sight.Asher glanced at the potion in my hand. Then she met my eyes and winced.She seemed to have something to say, but in the end, she just bit her lip saying nothing.How frustrating.I clicked my tongue and walked towards the boys.Regardless of Asher, I was thinking of helping them anyway. No matter how precious this potion was, was it more precious than human life?As I approached, the little guy who had been screaming in a hoarse voice looked at me.\u201cPut it down here. I\u2019ll treat you.\u201dI opened the stopper and drizzled the potion over the injured area.The older brother watched the scene in a daze. Suddenly, the surroundings were quiet.Soon, the flesh seemed to heal in an instant. The bleeding stopped and the cut that looked deep disappeared without a trace.I didn\u2019t think I used even a tenth of the amount in the bottle, but as Scarlett explained, its effect was great indeed.\u201cUh, uhm\u2026\u201dThe younger brother, who was unconscious, blinked and opened his eyes.The boy who urgently checked his brother\u2019s condition finally cried out.\u201cThank you! Sir! Thank you very much\u2026!\u201dLeaving behind the boy who cried out in gratitude, I got up and turned around.I said as Asher and I went back on our way.\u201cAsher.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cDid you think I would regret using this potion? Or did you think that saving their lives wasn\u2019t worth it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cFrom now on, if there\u2019s anything you want to say, say it. Tell me what you think. What I want isn\u2019t a doll that only obeys orders.\u201dAsher made a strange expression I had never seen before.\u201c\u2026Yes, I will.\u201dAfter a moment of silence, she spoke again.\u201cThank you, my lord. For helping them.\u201dIt was an awkward way of showing her gratitude.As if she knew it herself, Asher cleared her throat slightly after she said it.I chuckled.I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s an illusion, but it felt like the distance between us was gradually narrowed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He\u2019s the one who paid such a huge amount right on the spot\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, judging from what he said, it looks like he\u2019ll come back soon, so we\u2019ll know then.\u201dOf course, Scarlett was also curious about the man\u2019s identity.The attitude of treating three platinum coins as if they were a small amount of money without even signing a contract.It would be difficult for even the most wealthy or high-ranking aristocrats to do so.There were some people who used money to bluff and then scammed businesses, but there were no lunatics who would do that using platinum coins. At that point, that would no longer be considered a bluff.A human male with black hair and golden eyes\u2026Where the hell did he come from?It occurred to her that the other might be someone who was not from Calderic at all.Thane muttered.\u201cCome to think of it, there are rumors that the Seventh Lord who arrived in the city yesterday is also a black-haired human male\u2026\u201dFor a moment, the two of them closed their mouths and looked at each other.Soon, Scarlett smiled and said.\u201cSay something that makes sense.\u201d\u201cHaha, is that so? I just thought of it and said it.\u201dTo think that a Lord would visit this workshop in person.Rather, someone from a royal family of a neutral country would be much more realistic.The flow of thoughts naturally led to the Seventh Lord.Scarlett\u2019s expression darkened slightly.Regardless of what kind of person the new Seventh Lord would be, the problem with the high-ranking members of Varia was much bigger.She knew well that the reason those people hadn\u2019t been able to do big tricks so far was because of the regent.However, that ended with the new Seventh Lord ascending to the throne.Those people would slowly reveal their teeth to the workshop again.I can expect the Seventh Lord to mediate.The possibility that the Lord would be interested in the fight between Varia and the workshop, there was no hint of such a thing.And if the Lord was indifferent, the side that the territory\u2019s high-ranking officials would side with was, of course, the Varia Merchant Corps, who could bring there more profits.Scarlett sighed. She remembered her struggles with those people just a few years ago.As the owner of the workshop and the head of the Atima family, the responsibility was heavy.\u201cHow nice it would be if I could just focus on alchemy research without worrying about anything.\u201dAt the words she spat out, as if grumbling, Thane looked at her with calm eyes.He was also a member of the family, so he knew things were not going well.\u201cDon\u2019t worry too much, Sister. Those people would be busy to pay any attention to us, so they won\u2019t be able to do anything right away\u2026\u201dIt was then.Knock knock.\u201cCome on in.\u201dA vassal entered the room with a dark expression.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cVaria Merchants accompanied Bark and visited the workshop directly.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201cThey say they want to have a formal conversation right now to fix our difference in opinion.\u201dScarlett burst out laughing with a stunned expression.\u201cWhat formal conversation after coming here without a warning\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat should I do, house head?\u201d\u201cCall the elders together. We\u2019ll have to listen to what nonsense they\u2019re going to say again.\u201dIt was practically a threat, so she couldn\u2019t ignore it.Although she spoke calmly, Scarlett\u2019s face showed her deep thoughts.Varia\u2019s side was moving into action much sooner than they thought.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But this was enough.In fact, there was no need to investigate.In Calderic, the Lord was the law.Whether or not Varia broke the law, it didn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s not possible to immediately dismantle them if I wanted to.By the way, even when Floto gave me a detailed explanation of my job as a Lord, it was funny that he did not mention the power that the Lord had over his territory. Only a few restrictions. The great constitution enacted by the Overlord, the iron-rule of non-interference between the Lords\u2019 territories, and the inability to exercise independent military authority over other countries.I really could do anything I wanted, as long as it wasn\u2019t a dictatorship that destroyed the basic structure of the monarchy.Anyway, the reason I did this kind of investigation was because of a small bit of conscience.I knew Varia was like a villain because I had played the game, but that\u2019s all I knew.Wasn\u2019t it like stepping on someone with no justification just because I didn\u2019t like them?\u201cButler.\u201d\u201cYes, Seventh Lord.\u201d\u201cBring the head of Varia, and Scarlett, the workshop owner of Alkimas, to the castle. Treat the workshop owner politely and with respect.\u201d\u201cI will do as you command immediately.\u201dFloto did not show the slightest hint of surprise or doubt. He just walked away quickly after giving his answer.He must have already known what my intentions were based on my series of commands.I looked at the map again. I finished what I was doing and waited for the two of them leisurely.I said that I\u2019d see her again soon, but I never thought it would be this soon.***The large room of the Alkimas Workshop.In a chilly atmosphere, Varia said calmly while savoring his tea.\u201cAs expected, it\u2019s a place where artisans gather, so the tea tastes great. It makes me want to learn the secret.\u201dScarlett, who was sitting across from him, said with an expressionless face.\u201cYou should drink it in moderation. After all, it might be too fine for your coarse taste.\u201d\u201cI hope you don\u2019t misinterpret my sincere compliment like that.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s get down to the main topic. I would feel sorry for wasting the time of Varia\u2019s busy owner.\u201dVaria raised the corner of his mouth and put the teacup down.\u201cWhat do I want to say? I\u2019m just repeating the proposal I\u2019ve always made, and the workshop owner will reject it as always.\u201dScarlett replied calmly.\u201cIt\u2019s an obvious ploy to mass produce Alkimas potions with your capital, and to exploit the skills of our artisans.\u201d\u201cAs others say, the workshop owner is too full of negative prejudices about our group.\u201d\u201cWho the hell was it that created that prejudice? Blocking the distribution materials, conciliating the workshop\u2019s customers one by one, and mobilizing many petty things until just a few years ago to put pressure on the workshop?\u201dBark, the man with an eyepatch sitting next to Varia, giggled.\u201cWorkshop owner, be careful with what you say. We are not polite enough either. It would be unfair to accuse us like that without evidence.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ha!\u201d\u201cWhat do the elders think? For the sake of the workshop\u2019s future, shouldn\u2019t the loyal vassals break the stubbornness of the head of your family?\u201dAn older elder standing near Scarlett snorted.\u201cFor the sake of the future of the workshop, it is a proposal that should not be accepted.\u201d\u201cHaha, it really makes little sense. Our group would provide all the resources and funds necessary for potion production for the workshop. What the hell is wrong with this proposal?\u201d\u201cAnd the price would be the technology of the workshop and the ability of the family head. You probably have a workshop in operation in the nearby city of Flicke. After a few years, they will absorb most of our technology and steal the workshop\u2019s business partners one by one. In the end, our workshop will slowly fall, or you will force us to hand over the management rights of the workshop to you. Or is there a more elaborate and vicious strategy than this?\u201dVaria laughed at the elder\u2019s sharp words.\u201cI envy you because you have like-minded and loyal vassals, workshop owner.\u201dScarlett frowned.It was because she already knew that the other attempted to bribe several elders. He failed, of course.\u201cThey are proud people who have dedicated their lives to the well-being of our family. I don\u2019t think there will be anyone who would have the same opinion as you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cIs it the turn of threats next?\u201d\u201cWorkshop owner.\u201dVaria gave a smile that bordered on sneering.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to pretend to be calm. You know that things have changed.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThe new Seventh Lord arrived in the city just yesterday, and there was no more regent. Do you think the great Lord would take the slightest interest in such a trivial quarrel? Or, if he had one at all, whose side do you think he would be? Will he listen to you? Maybe if you have an elixir hidden in your family as an heirloom. If you donate it, he might be on your side.\u201dBark interjected and said with a sinister laugh.\u201cOr, since the workshop owner is beautiful, you can seduce him. There\u2019s a rumor that the new Lord is a human male, after all.\u201d\u201c\u2026Watch your words.\u201dThane, who had been standing behind Scarlett and kept his mouth shut, spoke with gritted teeth.The expression of the elders also turned stern at the remark openly insulting the head of the family.However, Bark still spoke in that manner, as if he didn\u2019t hear Thane.\u201cJust in case, how about marrying some young master? The workshop owner is not too old to be married. You shouldn\u2019t just live in such a dull place like this, you should also know the joy of being a woman.\u201d\u201cYou\u2013!\u201dThane was about to explode, but Scarlett raised a hand to stop him.\u201cDid you just come here to do such a lowly provocation? You\u2019ve thrown away your modesty.\u201dVaria stood up with a sneer.\u201cToday will probably be the last warning. I hope you make a wise choice for the future of the workshop, Miss Scarlett.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThen we will go now. No need to see us off.\u201dThe elders looked at the two with dark expressions as they walked out of the room.They came here without prior notice and threatened them.The future situation turned too unfavorable for the workshop. Even from tomorrow, there was no way to know what kind of dirty tricks Varia Merchant Corps would use.It was because until a few years ago, all the elders had been through so much that their teeth trembled at how nasty Varia had treated the workshop.Scarlett touched her forehead as if her head hurt.\u201cWhy don\u2019t we gather again in the evening and hold a meeting, family head?\u201d\u201cYes, we should. Then, for now\u2026\u201dScarlett and the elders talked about the future.Thane listened to the conversation with a firm expression, then sneaked out of the room.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With me?\u201dVaria stepped up and said.\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re trying to do. But Thane Atima, is this the meaning of the workshop?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m doing it on my own.\u201d\u201cWhy are you suddenly requesting a duel?\u201d\u201cBecause he insulted my sister. I don\u2019t think the One-Eyed Slayer, Bark, would refuse because he was afraid of a young swordsman like me.\u201dBark looked at Thane as if he was looking at some kind of puppy.It was common in this world to resolve trivial conflicts through a duel.However, that was only for opponents of equal standing. Bark was a warrior with a reputation for being the best in Varia. They even gave him the name One-Eyed Slayer.If I show off my strength here by defeating Bark, Varia cannot act recklessly.Thane did it because he thought it was worth it.He was also an outstanding martial artist for his age and he had his own confidence because he had made great progress recently.Bark glanced at Varia.Varia smiled broadly and nodded his head as telling his brother to take care of it.\u201cWell, good. I\u2019ll waste my time with you for a while.\u201dBark smiled and stepped forward.The central hall was wide enough for two people to cross swords.\u201cThane Atima, you\u2019ve been fairly well-known in the capital lately. Did you make it to the finals in the last Darthmad City swordsmanship competition? A young and talented warrior\u2019s challenge is always welcome.\u201dThane drew his sword first, and Bark drew his sword slowly as well.He raised the corner of his mouth and switched his sword to his other hand.\u201cShall I give you a handicap? I\u2019m right-handed, so I will wield my sword in my left hand. That should be enough.\u201d\u201c\u2026Do as you please!\u201dThane immediately went full force, intending to startle the other and force him to use both hands. The blade of his sword shimmered in blue.Kaang!The sword, which was swung with great force, was blocked languidly.Before one knew it, Bark with one hand behind his back, was blocking the sword attack. Even the blade of his sword shimmered with a blue aura.A blow that was blocked too easily.Thane was a little taken aback by the other\u2019s sword that was not pushed and did not move at all, but he continued to attack again.Kaang! Kang! Kakakang!Blue lines intersecting in the air. A continuous roaring sound.The flashes that were hard to see with the eyes of ordinary people continued to come and go.Thane\u2019s sword was fast and sophisticated. He was clearly a high-level swordsman for his age.However, all his attacks were blocked and destroyed by Bark\u2019s lightly swinging sword.\u201cKuh..!\u201dAs time passed, darkness fell on Thane\u2019s face as he wielded his sword.He couldn\u2019t have imagined that the gap would be this large.Jang!!And at some point, pieces of metal scattered.Bark\u2019s hand, which suddenly sped up, shattered Thane\u2019s sword.\u201cKuk\u2026!\u201dThane, shocked as he was, let out a moan of pain and fell to his knees.Looking down at him, Bark grinned.People arrived at the same time. Scarlett and the elders immediately came out after hearing the commotion downstairs.\u201c\u2026Thane!\u201dScarlett shouted with an urgent expression and came running. She then glared intently at Varia.\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d\u201cAh, don\u2019t misunderstand. The one who challenged Bark for a duel was your younger brother.\u201dThane lowered his head with a horribly distorted expression, avoiding Scarlett\u2019s gaze. Realizing the situation, she let out a sigh.\u201c\u2026I will apologize for my brother\u2019s rudeness. The victory had already been decided, so please stop the duel.\u201dAt that, Bark raised an evil corner of his mouth and said.\u201cHe\u2019s the first to attack. Wouldn\u2019t it make sense if I finish it at least?\u201dFu-wook!He plunged the blade into Thane\u2019s arm as the other lay on the floor.\u201cAarrgh\u2026!\u201dThe faces of Scarlett and the elders turned white.\u201cThe younger brother of the workshop owner can\u2019t control his hot bloodedness. So we should give him a chance to learn this time.\u201d\u201cN-, wait\u2026 stop!\u201d\u201cTsk, tsk, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to kill him. Why are you so nervous? There are a lot of good quality potions here, so there shouldn\u2019t be any problem with treatment.\u201dBark said that and swung the blade into his arm. Thane couldn\u2019t stand it and let out his screams of pain.\u201cStop! Stop now!\u201dScarlett completely lost her composure and cried out as if pleading.Bark chuckled as if he was having fun.\u201cHaha! If you\u2019re that desperate, get down on your knees and beg a little more earnestly, workshop owner. Then I\u2019ll stop\u2026\u201dIt was then.Rattle!Suddenly, the entrance to the hall opened, and a series of knights appeared.Everyone\u2019s eyes were drawn to their sudden appearance.Varia\u2019s eyes widened.He, who had just been watching the situation with a leisurely smile, murmured with a puzzled expression.\u201c\u2026Iron Blood Knights?\u201dIron Blood Knights directly under the Seventh Lord\u2019s castle.Varia couldn\u2019t understand why the most elite force of the Lord, who did not move unless it was a serious matter, suddenly appeared here.Scarlett and the elders looked at them with bewildered expressions, and Bark dragged out the sword stuck in Thane\u2019s arm.The blonde-haired man at the head of the knights looked around, then approached the center of the hall and opened his mouth.\u201cVaria, the owner of the Varia Mechant Corps.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cFollow me right now. You have no right to refuse. I will not take questions.\u201dAnd this time, he turned his head to Scarlett and spoke in a much more polite tone.\u201cAre you Scarlett, the owner of Alkimas Workshop?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, I am.\u201d\u201cPlease, accompany us as well. The Lord is looking for you.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dEveryone\u2019s faces were filled with astonishment.If the knight called someone \u2018lord\u2019, then it couldn\u2019t be anyone than the Seventh Lord.Meanwhile, Bark asked with a frown.\u201cCould it be that you\u2019re going to the Lord\u2019s castle? Why are you taking my older brother suddenly? At least give a reason\u2026\u201dWhoa!Bark\u2019s words were cut short.It was because the knight he asked drew his sword and attacked him without warning.Bark also hurriedly drew his sword and defended himself, but his blade shattered.\u201cKeuk\u2026!\u201dBark fell to his knees as fresh blood poured from his chest that had been split diagonally.The knight looked down at him coldly and withdrew his sword.\u201cI said I wouldn\u2019t take questions. Do you dare to question the Lord\u2019s mandate?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Didn\u2019t he arrive in the capital just yesterday?What was even more incomprehensible was the vice-captain\u2019s attitude.Anyone could see that he was overbearing on their side, but was polite to Scarlett.While Varia was confused, he couldn\u2019t help but feel an ominous feeling that something terrible was about to happen.The vice-captain who drew the sword approached Scarlett and stood next to him without paying attention to the fallen Bark.\u201cThen we\u2019ll move right away.\u201dScarlett looked at Thane and the elders in embarrassment, as the others were looking at the knights at the same time.\u201cUmm, why are taking the family head\u2026\u201dOne elder opened his mouth involuntarily, but shut it back immediately.He had no choice but to do so because Bark who did the same, was now in that kind of situation.However, the vice-captain answered in a polite voice this time.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, the Lord asked us to escort the workshop owner, so it\u2019s definitely not a bad thing.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe elders had no choice but to remain silent.Although they were worried about why the Seventh Lord was looking for the family head, but they couldn\u2019t stand in the way of the knights either.\u201cSi- sister.\u201dThane grabbed his wounded arm and stood up.Scarlett saw that and was about to talk to the vice-captain, but another elder stepped forward and said.\u201cFamily head, don\u2019t worry and go. We will treat Thane\u2019s arm right away.\u201dShe hesitated, then nodded.Knights were attached to both sides of Scarlett. Some knights then approached Varia.Varia let out a small sigh and turned to Bark.\u201cTreat your wound.\u201dThe knights led the two of them and moved straight to the Lord\u2019s castle.***After passing through the main gate of the castle and entering the inner sanctuary, Scarlett looked around with a nervous expression.Just looking at the sight of the knights standing guard throughout the castle, she felt the severity of the situation.There was no way that she, a mere outsider, had ever entered the interior of the castle like this.When I reached the huge building in the center, there was an elderly butler waiting at the entrance.He bowed his head and greeted Scarlett.\u201cMy name is Floto, the head butler. The Lord is waiting for you, let me lead you there.\u201dThen he turned his gaze and took a quick glance at Varia before he started walking in the lead.Passing through a wide and long corridor and stairs, we arrived at the highest floor of the building.When I arrived at the central hall on the top floor, I saw a man sitting on a chair looking at something, and a female knight standing behind him.\u201c\u2026?\u201dUpon seeing the scene, Scarlett\u2019s face was instantly filled with doubt and bewilderment.It had to be. Because the faces of the two were familiar.The unknown customer who visited the studio in the morning and bought a scarlet potion, and paid three platinum coins as if they were a penny.But what were they doing here\u2026\u201cMy lord.\u201dFloto said and bowed his head.Scarlett also looked at the man with a dazed expression.Suddenly, the conversation she had with Thane flashed through her mind. A conversation about the newly enthroned Seventh Lord.\u201cAs you commanded, I brought you the owner of Alkimas Workshop and the head of the Varia Merchant Corps.\u201dPutting down the thing he was holding in his hand, the man slowly turned his head to look at Scarlett and opened his mouth.\u201cWe met again so soon, workshop owner.\u201dScarlett, who finally grasped the whole situation, lost her mind for a while, then belatedly lowered her head.\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to meet the Seventh Lord\u2026\u201dThe Seventh Lord then turned his gaze to Varia this time.Varia did not dare to make eye contact and hurriedly bowed his head.\u201cIt\u2019s a lifetime honor to meet the Seventh Lord\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy do you think I called you?\u201dVaria felt his heart froze at that indifferent and cold voice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why did the Seventh Lord call him and Scarlett?Unlike his side, the knights treated Scarlett politely, and then there was the reaction of the Lord now, as if they were already familiar with each other\u2026Varia desperately shook his head, feeling a sense of crisis and fear for the first time in his life. What kind of answer should he give?Soon, Varia dropped to his knees and said.\u201cI have committed a mortal sin, my lord.\u201dIn an instant, the hall became quiet.Varia hung his head on the floor and waited for an answer.After a while, the Seventh Lord opened his mouth again.\u201cWhat sin did you commit?\u201d\u201cI coveted the talent and labor of Alkimas Workshop and did various dirty tricks on them. I blocked the distribution of materials, conciliated the workshop\u2019s customers one by one, and threatened the workshop owner and elders like I did today.\u201dVaria confessed his sins like flowing water.He started out empty-handed with nothing but a sense for money and built up the current merchant group.No matter how much he thought about the most likely way to survive here, this was the best way. After all, the Lord would know everything.Scarlett, who was standing next to Varia, looked down at him as if he was a little bewildered.The Seventh Lord asked her this time.\u201cThat\u2019s right, workshop lord.\u201d\u201cAh, yes\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat do you want to do with the Varia Merchant Corps?\u201dScarlett and Varia\u2019s eyes met.Varia looked up at her with the most earnest gaze.\u201cPlease forgive me, workshop owner. I will formally apologize for everything I\u2019ve done until now, and I will thoroughly compensate you for everything. And I promise that I will no longer be blinded by greed and commit dirty tricks against the workshop.\u201dScarlett looked at him with a complicated expression on his face as he spoke up and pleaded.Then she let out a small sigh and nodded her head.\u201cI get it.\u201dVaria was contemptuous enough to make her teeth tremble, but she didn\u2019t want to ask his head for it.The story ended blandly like that, and the Seventh Lord gazed down at Varia and said.\u201cHopefully, I don\u2019t have to call you here again.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cGo.\u201dVaria shuddered from her seat and followed Floto out of the hall with a drained face.Left alone, Scarlett stood still, with a bewildered expression on her face.The Seventh Lord looked at her and said.\u201cYou must be wondering why I am helping the workshop.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, that\u2019s right.\u201dThe problem with Varia, which had been hounding her, was quickly resolved with just a few words from the Lord. To be honest, it felt unrealistic.As much as she was grateful, Scarlett did not know what the hell was he trying to do by helping her.\u201cThe reason is simple. Your qualities as an alchemist stood out for me.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cThe scarlet potion is quite good. I hope you will focus on your research and develop that potion even further. That\u2019s why I solved the annoying problem for you.\u201dScarlett\u2019s face became even more incomprehensible.\u201cSo what the Lord was saying is that you\u2019re not planning to ask anything from me just because you highly valued my abilities?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t understand, think of it as a debt. One day, there may come a time when I would need your ability. You can consider paying me that favor when that time comes.\u201dTo Scarlett, that sounded even stranger.How could a Lord ever need the help of an alchemist like himself?\u201cIf you don\u2019t have any further questions, you can go.\u201dScarlett was silent for a moment, then bowed her head deeply.\u201cI have received a great grace from my lord. As you wished, if the time comes when the Lord would need my ability\u2026 I will do my best to help.\u201dAfter saying goodbye, Scarlett went outside, following Floto, who just returned.The new Seventh Lord was truly mysterious, she thought.***After sending the two of them back, I finished drinking the tea I was drinking.That guy acted pretty fast.I thought of Varia kneeling down and apologizing, and I smiled.Just like that, he lowered himself and confessed, so the investigation of Varia Merchang Corps was no longer necessary. The conversation only took a few minutes.Anyway, this was the end of the workshop issue.Varia noticed I was involved with the workshop, so he could no longer show his ambition. He even tried to mend his relationship with Scarlett.Of course, I didn\u2019t need her ability right away.However, if I formed a relationship with the NPCs who appeared as good characters in the game one by one like this, they might be a big help to me someday when I least expected it.Then, what\u2019s left is\u2026I looked back at the map I had set down on my desk and crossed my arms.The sooner I leave here, the better, so I could find the next mystery.I\u2019m a little worried about the route I should take.My top priority right now was to collect all the mysteries within the realm of Calderic.And among them, the most necessary was the defense-type ability.Therefore, it\u2019s already fixed that the next mystery was the \u2018floating curtain\u2019. But the route I should take to get there was still not fixed. I had to be careful about going around Calderic after all.\u201cLord.\u201dI was thinking about that when Floto came back and called me.I wondered if there was anything left to say about the workshop or the merchant group, but the words he said next were totally unexpected.\u201cA guest has come.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cThe Fourth Lord is here.

That\u2019s why it\u2019s hard for me to refuse.This was my base, and it would be rude if I refused to see him. I already had a somewhat bad relationship with the Thunder Lord.The Fourth Lord was the opposite of the Tyrant, a Lord who maintained a gentle relationship with all the other Lords. So, I wanted to avoid being his enemy.In fact, a meeting with a Lord didn\u2019t mean that I have to take a huge risk.Since I was also a Lord, the other would definitely not act recklessly.However, since I was so weak, contact with someone much stronger still felt burdensome.There\u2019s no way he came here without a reason\u2026Still, the King of the Dead was a Lord who belonged to the normal side among the Lords.Having made my decision, I told Floto.\u201cTake him here.\u201dI wondered if I should go out and greet him myself, but I thought there was no need to do that since he was the one who came here himself.It took a while before Floto, who bowed his head and retreated, returned with someone.A black robe rimmed with gold. And a skull visible through the hood\u2026The place where the eyes should have been was empty, and I could see the ghostly blue eyes glowing faintly.As the being entered the hall, the secluded atmosphere seemed to be filled with gloom.He stopped at the entrance of the hall and made eye contact with me.[Lv. 95]\u2026This skull was the King of the Dead, the Fourth Lord.He looked nothing like what I saw in the game.The King of the Dead was holding in one hand a huge wooden staff that was as tall as his height, and that was also the staff he was holding in the game.\u201cNice to meet you, Seventh Lord.\u201dA strange voice that seemed not to be coming out of the throat rang in my ears.Come to think of it, how did a guy who was a skeleton but had no vocal cords speak? Was that all magic?\u201cI\u2019m sorry for coming here so suddenly, with no warning. I\u2019m just here to have a quick chat. May I sit down?\u201dI gestured to the seat opposite.The King of the Dead approached with brisk steps and sat down on a chair. Silence fell in an instant.Sitting close to him, I could feel the energy surrounding him much more clearly.If what I felt when facing the Mad King was the pressure that seemed to weigh down my whole body, what I felt from the King of the Dead was eerie. It\u2019s as if death took shape and materialized as it was\u2026Now I\u2019m really thankful for the [Soul of the King].If it wasn\u2019t for that, my body might have been already shaking without me realizing it.Once again, I felt grateful for this absolute mind barrier skill.\u201cWhat the matter?\u201dI asked, feigning indifference. Since it was their first meeting, I couldn\u2019t think of anything that we could talk about.And I wanted to end this conversation as soon as possible.Interacting with him was much less gruesome than the Black Sea Empress, but it was equally burdensome to face a skeleton for a long time.The King of the Dead, who was staring at me with his blue eyes shining, soon spoke in a voice that sounded like laughter.\u201cIt surprised me when I heard the Overlord had appointed a new Lord straight from the meeting. Now I regret not being able to attend the last meeting.\u201dI made no reply.When there was no reply, he continued to talk about useless things that he obviously didn\u2019t come here for.\u201cSeventh Lord, I have a lot of interest in you personally, especially after hearing what happened during the meeting. It\u2019s been the first time that a human sat on a Lord\u2019s throne after half a century\u2026\u201d\u201cKing of the Dead.\u201dI cut him off.\u201cI don\u2019t like useless dialogue.\u201dThe King of the Dead said nothing for a while, then burst into laughter.\u201cThen, I\u2019ll tell you right away. The corpse of the warrior you killed, Seventh Lord, I came for it.\u201dThose words brought back memories I had forgotten.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So, I\u2019m here to ask permission to have it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dOh yeah, ownership\u2026Come to think of it, Dayphon said that I owned the body.So, the King of the Dead came to see me personally because he wanted to take over the authority of the corpse.He really didn\u2019t need to go to me just for that.Even if he didn\u2019t ask permission, I wouldn\u2019t have cared.Still, from the perspective of the King of the Dead, I wondered if he asked for permission just in case I would question him about it later.However, after coming all the way here and asking for permission like this\u2026 it really felt like just a waste.As soon as I stared at him, the King of the Dead continued.\u201cI\u2019ll pay you a fair price.\u201dA fair price.Several things ran through my mind.For example, magic items. Since the King of the Dead was a mage, shouldn\u2019t he have defense-type items I need the most right now?But that\u2019s hard to say\u2026It\u2019s as if I\u2019m openly confessing that I need items because I lack defensive skills.And when I thought about it, I didn\u2019t even know if I could use magic items properly.I thought about it for a while and then said.\u201cI want nothing from you.\u201dThen the King of the Dead said.\u201cThen how about leaving it as a debt? Later, when you want something from me, I\u2019ll pay the price equal to the value of the warrior\u2019s corpse.\u201dI nodded my head because it was ambiguous to ask for something right away, and it was not a bad suggestion.I thought it would be better to end it at this point without poking further.\u201cDo you need anything else?\u201d\u201cNo. You don\u2019t seem to enjoy my company, so I\u2019ll be going right away.\u201dAfter saying that, the King of the Dead got up from his seat and leisurely left the hall.I buried myself in the chair, feeling empty for no reason, probably because the conversation I worried about ended blandly.At that moment, Asher, who was standing behind me, let out a small trembling breath.I glanced at her expression. The presence of the King of the Dead affected her this much.I was fine because of the [Soul of the King], but the \u2018fear\u2019 that the King of the Dead exuded seemed to be a considerable burden to her.Ugh\u2026Was I going to be continuously stuck between these monsters?The conversation with the King of the Dead, which was short and bland, only gave me more hopelessness about the future.But this was the path I chose.I have to collect the hidden pieces as soon as possible.***An undead knight in black armor waiting in front of the castle gate bowed his head toward the King of the Dead, who walked out.\u2018You came out right away.\u2019Necromancers and their subordinates were spiritually connected, allowing dialogue through their consciousness, as well as sharing images of what they saw.The undead knight had doubts about the feelings of the King of the Dead, who were rarely happy.The King of the Dead laughed mentally.\u2018The new Seventh Lord is really interesting.\u2019Hundreds of years of leading immortality in the undead\u2019s body.Since death no longer meant anything to him, paradoxically, he could feel \u2018death\u2019 more clearly than anyone else.But how long had it been since he felt this feeling?\u2018\u2026I never thought I would feel the fear of death.\u2019I couldn\u2019t feel any aura or mana from the Seventh Lord.Neither magical power nor physical strength could be felt, so he looked like an ordinary human with no real abilities.But the other definitely could kill him.The only person who he felt this kind of feeling after he became a lich was the hero of Santea, and it was only faintly felt even by the Overlord.He had come in person to get the warrior\u2019s corpse and to see what kind of person the new Seventh Lord was, but it turned out to be more enjoyable that he thought.\u2018I can\u2019t wait to see what kind of request he will make later.\u2019That\u2019s why I was happy to even create a link through debt.The King of the Dead pondered over the realization of death he had felt for the first time in a long while and firmly imprinted the existence of the Seventh Lord in his mind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It wouldn\u2019t be strange if I, a human, would be attacked right away if I appeared there.It\u2019s really difficult.It\u2019s difficult to decide.The order of obtaining the other mysteries was pretty much all set.However, suddenly discovering a new way to use [Instant Kill] and blood magic, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if I should visit Elrod Forest in the middle.If Asher and I went there alone, things would definitely become bad.But if I mobilize the troops of my territory, things would get too big.It would be equivalent to going to war.No matter how peaceful a tribe was, vampires themselves were a fairly warlike race, and they had a lot of hostility towards other races.If I led my troops to Elrod Forest, the vampires there would definitely resist, no matter what kind of threat they faced.If that happens, I will become a killer who massacred a whole tribe just to get a blood skill.And since Elrod Forest was in a different Lord\u2019s territory, it would have been difficult to lead an army.The reason I sought an escort like Asher in the first place was because I couldn\u2019t lead my army on the lands of the other Lords.I sank into the chair and let out a sluggish breath. And I turned my thoughts elsewhere.A way to use [Instant Kill] from a distance without blood magic.In the Rutus Mountains, where I climbed to get super regeneration, I met Bellvagorah and almost died.I had to travel all over Calderic looking for other mysteries, but I could encounter such unexpected dangers again that even Asher couldn\u2019t handle.There\u2019s nothing wrong with preparing a way to use [Instant Kill] more efficiently to prepare for that time.Long distance attack.If there was a way to just cut a wound and splatter blood\u2026However, since that would only fly a few distances, it was difficult to even call it a long-range attack.In this world overflowing with all kinds of monsters, if an enemy came within a few meters to attack me, I would be much more likely to die before I could do anything.Another method was to smear blood on something and blow it off.For example, shooting an arrow with blood on the arrowhead.That would seem to be the best.But, of course, there\u2019s one problem. I didn\u2019t know how to shoot a bow.I just need to learn if I don\u2019t know how.Anyway, the danger I was likely to face while searching for mysteries was huge monsters like Bellevagorah.Those filthy strong guys should be able to dodge several shots from a poor archer.I didn\u2019t intend to waste time, but it wouldn\u2019t hurt to learn how to shoot casually.And because of the mystery of super regeneration, my stamina was overflowing, so you could practice as much as I want without needing to rest.Then let\u2019s learn it.I got up from my seat.It\u2019s farfetched to ask the other knights of the castle to teach me how to use the bow.Then, there\u2019s only one suitable person.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was a sloppy form.\u201cYou lowered your right shoulder too much. And the hand holding the arrow\u2026\u201dAt Asher\u2019s request, he slightly change his stance.\u201c\u2026Aim at the target like what I just did, and now shoot.\u201dThe Seventh Lord set up a demonstration.The arrow flew sloppily and fell to the floor without even reaching the target.Asher looked at it and said.\u201cYou lost your posture the moment you fired.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s try again.\u201dAs the Seventh Lord continued to shoot arrows, Asher watched from the side and pointed out what was wrong.About half an hour passed.The Seventh Lord still could not hit a single arrow at the target, which was less that 30 paces away.\u201c\u2026\u201dAsher looked at the arrows piled on the floor and the walls with a slightly stiff expression, then turned her gaze back to the Seventh Lord.Piing!The flying arrow hit the wall next to the target without fail.\u201cYou made a mistake in your grip again.\u201dThe Seventh Lord kept repeating what she had pointed out nearly ten times. Like a person who had no sense of moving his body at all.The Seventh Lord lowered his bow and looked back at her.\u201cAre you mad?\u201d\u201c\u2026No.\u201d\u201cYour voice is stiff. You must be angry.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201dThe Seventh Lord shook his head and said.\u201cHow about correcting my posture once?\u201dIt meant putting her hands directly on his body and guiding his posture.Asher hesitated for a moment before moving closer.Was it a big deal to touch a Lord\u2019s body? She even carried him on her back in Rutus Mountains.\u201cFix your shoulders like this\u2026\u201dAs she touched the Seventh Lord\u2019s body here and there, Asher felt it again.It\u2019s really a soft body that hasn\u2019t been trained in the slightest. As if it would break just by touching it.\u2026The image of the Seventh Lord who defeated the monster snake in the mountains suddenly flashed in her mind.What was the source of that unreasonable power he showed?I felt a bleakness that was hard to gauge from the Fourth Lord, the King of the Dead, whom I had unexpectedly seen before.However, on the contrary, Asher did not dare to judge the Seventh Lord by any standard just because she felt nothing of the sort from him. Wouldn\u2019t even this lousy body be a shell with little meaning to him\u2026?Piing!As she corrected his posture, the Seventh Lord who shot the arrow finally hit the target for the first time.He put on a slightly satisfied expression.\u201cI\u2019m getting the hang of it.\u201dAs he said, the Seventh Lord fired a few more shots, all the arrows hit the target, and the practice was over.A/N: Update schedule for this novel is every other day.

Like the Mad King, for example.Floto bowed his head with the same expression as always.\u201cI\u2019ll prepare it right away, as you have instructed.\u201dExcept for Asher, I went with only one attendant.It was because there had to be someone who was familiar with the geography of Calderic and could do miscellaneous tasks.I had to go around other Lord\u2019s territories, so I thought one person was enough. I just couldn\u2019t drag a bunch of people around, and it made little sense to attach a few more people cumbersomely.[Lv. 46]\u201cMy name is Baros, a first-grade butler.\u201dA cold-looking male elf wearing glasses greeted us politely.Floto brought him under my command to find a suitable person to become my attendant regardless of age and gender.The level was also quite high, well over 40.\u201cI\u2019m going to wander all over Calderic. Can you guide me without us getting lost in the process?\u201d\u201cYes, Lord.\u201d\u201cThen get ready to leave immediately.\u201dThe composition of the crew was over, and Floto took care of the packing.\u201cPrepare a plain and inconspicuous wagon.\u201dIt didn\u2019t seem like a good idea to ride around in a huge, patterned, ornate carriage like the one I rode here from the Overlord\u2019s castle.Because it could have exposed my location and route to the other Lords.Since I was planning to go to the other Lords\u2019 territories without revealing my identity as much as possible.Although there\u2019s a rule that Lords couldn\u2019t hurt each other, there was always an \u2018if\u2019. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being careful.After finishing all the preparations, Asher and I got on the wagon at the entrance of the castle and Floto saw us off.\u201cSafe travels, my lord.\u201dPassing by the knights who were saluting at the castle gate, the carriage briskly pulled out of the main gate.***The next mystery to be targeted was the \u2018floating veil\u2019, a defense-type mystery.This mystery with a somewhat unusual name was an excellent mystery that could be said to be absolute, at least in terms of defensive ability.Its level in the game was 9 stars, the same as the [Soul of the King].Of course, there was one fatal penalty as well.However, for me now, it was more important than anything else to get excellent defense, so the penalty wasn\u2019t that important.[Instant Kill] was the best offensive ability, but it had no defensive ability at all because it only activated once I was in direct contact with the target.I was in a precarious situation in which, even if a level 20 hit me with a punch, my head would explode as it was. It was definitely necessary to improve somehow.Tyrell Mountains.The hidden location of the [Floating Veil] was somewhere in the Tyrell Mountains on the northern border of Sarogal, the 5th Lord\u2019s territory.I didn\u2019t remember the exact location like the super-regeneration, because it was not a mystery that I found myself.There was a video of another player who recorded getting the floating veil and it became a hot topic, so I kind of remember it.It\u2019s in a place like a ruined dungeon.It wouldn\u2019t be easy to find, but I was going to find it and get it somehow.There might be a way to mobilize a good deal of manpower by seeking help from the Mad King, but it was a method I was reluctant to use.It was because the Mad King herself was not a person who could communicate with others well. And if I was asked to explain the reason, I could not.It\u2019s not a good idea to borrow someone else\u2019s power to get the mystery.Because once someone touched the mystery pattern, that person would absorb the mystery.If someone discovered the mystery first and they gobbled it up, there was no way I could make them spit it out.It would be best to only hire a guide, as with super-regeneration.Currently, the wagon was passing through the woods.Calderic was a land formed with the Overlord\u2019s territory as the center and the lands of the nine lords surrounding it.The road I chose to the 5th Lord\u2019s territory was to go obliquely past the outskirts of the 6th Lord\u2019s.

How dare you pass through such a forest fearlessly without an escort!\u201dA gruff voice echoed from outside the carriage.Is it a thief?In this medieval fantasy world, thieves and monsters were common on the road.It was only when I headed to Enrock from the Overlord Castle that the escort knights were full, so I never encountered a group of bandits, but that was not the case now.It\u2019s not a situation I didn\u2019t expect.\u201cGet off the wagon! Give everything you have and\u2026 Whoa!\u201dAnd the screams continued.The sound of something being torn to pieces and a terrible scream echoed continuously, and soon it was quiet outside.I sneakily opened the window and poked my head out to see the scattered corpses and Baros wiping the blood from his glasses.Around him, something like the wind took shape, swaying, then disappearing\u2026 Was that a spirit?Baros, who met my eyes, lowered his head as if to apologize.\u201cMy apologies. We stopped moving because of the garbage.\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s fine.\u201dBaros climbed into the driver\u2019s seat, and the carriage started again.There seemed to be no need for Asher to take care of the thieves.***After that, our travel continued, encountering thieves and monsters intermittently.After a long time, we finally arrived at our destination, the territory of the 5th Lord, Sarogal.The city of Kwarzhen, a large city in the northern frontier.After spending a night at a luxury inn to wash off my fatigue, the next day I immediately went to the adventurer\u2019s guild in the city.\u201cThat\u2019s why, at that desperate moment, I grabbed the monster\u2019s horn and left it\u2026\u201d\u201cSally, how about a drink tonight, just the two of us? Huh? After earning a lot from the previous request, I can buy you expensive alcohol.\u201dHow could I describe the inside of the guild building? The atmosphere was exactly what I had imagined.A person carefully looking through the request forms pasted on the wall, a person who was continuously bragging about his heroic deeds, and a person who was flirting with the staff at the counter\u2026After looking at the scene for a while, I approached the counter and was greeted by a woman from a beast tribe who was doing her job with a smile.\u201cWelcome, young master. Do you have a request you want to apply for?\u201dShe asked that probably after judging based on my outfit that I came here to request something.I nodded and asked.\u201cWhich adventurer in this city is the most knowledgeable with the geography of Tyrell Mountains?\u201dShe answered without a moment\u2019s thought.\u201cYou are looking for an adventurer knowledgeable in the geography of the Tyrell Mountains. Do you want a guide?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cDoes it matter if it\u2019s an adventurer or just a normal individual?\u201d\u201cDoes not matter.\u201d\u201cThen, I recommend the Blue Fox Adventurer Team. The leader, Mr. Rodin, is a first-class adventurer, and a has a considerable reputation here in Kwarzhen. They are sitting right there right now. Would you like to meet them?\u201dAt the place the woman pointed out, several men and women were sitting around and talking on the railing on the second floor.As I followed her up the stairs and got closer, I met their questioning glances.Five adventurers, men and women, each armed with various weapons such as swords, spears, and bows.[Lv. 36]Among them, the female receptionist talked to the man with the highest level, a huge sword standing next to the table.\u201cMr. Rodin, there is a request for you.

A request?\u201dHe looked back and forth between me and the receptionist, scratching his beard, then spoke to her.\u201cChelsea, we already agreed to take on an escort request to Polyp City. Didn\u2019t you know?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes? Did you?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t think I can take on that request, sir. Find another adventurer.\u201dUnaware of the fact, the receptionist had a puzzled expression on her face.I asked her.\u201cAre these guys the most knowledgeable when it came to the geography of Tyrell Mountains?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s true, but\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, young master. Since they already agreed to a prior request, I\u2019ll introduce you to another.\u201dI shook my head.Looking at the levels, the skills seemed clear, and I wanted to bring the best manpower.\u201cIf it\u2019s like that, I\u2019ll pay more. So, can you cancel that request and take mine?\u201dAt my words, a man named Rodin laughed a little and replied.\u201cI can\u2019t do that, sir. If I cancelled the commission I already received, I have to pay several times the advance payment as a penalty.\u201dThat was only natural since if the adventurer side arbitrarily cancelled the request, it would harm the client as well.I asked again.\u201cHow much is the cancellation fee?\u201d\u201cSince the advance payment received is five gold, I will have to pay 10 gold, which is doubled.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll hire you for 20 gold. How about it?\u201dRodin\u2019s eyes widened, as if my condition sounded quite unconventional.But in the end, he shook his head.\u201cA penalty is also a penalty, but there is trust with the client. If we break the first request to take on another request, what will people think of our group?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll double the commission to 40 gold.\u201dRodin\u2019s pupils twitched.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I really can\u2019t, sir\u2026\u201d\u201cThree times, 60 gold.\u201d\u201c\u2026There is a thing called credibility\u2014\u201d\u201cFive times, 100 gold. This is my last offer.\u201dRodin\u2019s words were cut off.The other members also gulped and looked at Rodin.He slowly got up from his seat, dragging his chair, and bent his back.\u201cWelcome, dear client.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s difficult to reveal my origin.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Then why do you want to climb the Tyrell Mountains?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m looking for something.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cThat would be difficult to say.\u201d\u201cAh, yes\u2026\u201dFor a moment, there was silence in the place.Rodin and his members looked quite disturbed, as if they didn\u2019t expect that they had to do this after accepting my request.I took a money bag from my pocket and put five or six gold coins on the table.They focused their attention on the gold coins piling up on the table.\u201cI\u2019ll give you 30 gold right now as a down payment. I know it\u2019s not an easy request, but you will definitely receive a good pay.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cStill, if you can\u2019t take on the request, I will understand. So, will you do it?\u201dRodin, who was troubled, seemed to exchange glances with his members, and finally nodded his head.\u201cDo we only have to guide the two of you?\u201dRodin looked back and forth between me and Asher, who was standing behind me.I nodded.He, too, nodded and briefly introduced himself and his members.\u201cMy name is Rodin, the leader of the Blue Fox Adventure Team. And starting from the left, Arma, Lud, Baxter, and Shien\u2026\u201dFive people, including two men armed with swords, shields and spears, a woman holding a bow, a woman who looked like a wizard because she was unarmed, and Rodin.A woman carrying a bow called Shien smiled and looked at the gold coins piled on the table.\u201cIn fact, there are no other adventurers around who are as knowledgeable about the geography of the Tyrell Mountains as we are. You really came to the right place, young master.\u201d\u201cThat crazy bitch, look at how she\u2019s staring at the money\u2026\u201dLud, who was sitting next to her, spoke as if muttering, and then was slapped on the back by Shien.I also simply stated my name.\u201cMy name is Ron. This is Asher, my escort.\u201d\u201cYes, anyway, thank you. We will accept this request.\u201dRodin\u2019s blue fox adventurers eventually accepted the request.***It didn\u2019t matter if we started right away, but they also needed to prepare, so I had an extra day of rest.Early the next morning, the adventurers and I gathered in front of the eastern gate of the city.There was no need for Baros to be there, so he stayed at the inn and only Asher accompanied me.\u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI could feel Asher looking at me strangely as I came out of the inn room.She must be looking at the bows and arrows I brought.In her eyes, I could see that she wanted to ask why I have to bring these items when I couldn\u2019t even shoot properly, but I ignored it.Who knew what other unimaginable dangers there would be this time, like Bellevagorah?Even the slightest complacency could lead to death.Preparing everything that could be prepared was the right attitude to survive in this harsh world.\u201cAre you here?\u201dHe met the adventurers waiting in front of the gate and headed straight for the Tyrell Mountains.Tyrell Mountains.One characteristic of this mountain range was that there were a lot of Orcs.Orcs were common monsters that could be found anywhere, but they were especially common in the Tyrell Mountains.However, since they were only level 20 at the highest level, there was nothing to worry about safety.A few hours after I started climbing the mountain range, I could keep pace with the adventurers without running out of stamina anymore.And not long after, we encountered a group of orcs.Quiik.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They looked just like what one would see in the game.Eight in total. Some of them had rusty iron swords or spears in their hands.\u201cAre these bastards crazy and coming down here to hunt?\u201dRodin and his members did not hesitate to step forward and start slaughtering the Orcs.Those with spear swords fought in front, and assisted in the battle by throwing arrows and magic from behind. Asher and I watched the scene in silence.In particular, since there was Rodin who was over level 30, the battle ended simply.We sat down for a while, rested, and chatted with the adventurers.\u201cOrcs are smarter than you think, so even seasoned adventurers can be hunted and killed if they make a mistake. The weapons the Orcs were holding earlier were originally used by stealing other adventurers\u2019 weapons.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dOf course, that was something I knew.Since Orcs lived in a community as a tribal unit, their intelligence was excellent for a monster.As I accepted the conversation well, the adventurers also added more stories.\u201cDo you know about how the Orc monster wave happens?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it something that rarely happens when a mutant king appears?\u201d\u201cYes, you knew. Originally, because of their tyrannical nature, they couldn\u2019t gather in large groups. When a king is born, all of them unite under him and become a completely terrible disaster.\u201dMonster wave.As the name suggests, it referred to a phenomenon in which a huge group of monsters rushes like a wave.There were many causes, but one of them was the existence of a \u2018king\u2019, a mutant that was very rare among monsters.The monsters from which the king was born were typically Orcs and Lizardmen. When the king was born, an overwhelming army of monsters, from thousands to tens of thousands, was formed and invaded human territory.If it\u2019s an Orc King, then it would be over level 70.Anyway, such monster waves were major events that often occurred in the game's story.After taking a break, we started moving again.***It had been a week since we started searching the Tyrell Mountains.As expected, the adventurers did not get lost and successfully guided them to their destinations.However, after searching many peaks and canyons, I still hadn\u2019t found the mystery.Even as I moved, I continued to search hard for my memory.I\u2019m sure it was a canyon terrain.It was not narrow, but quite wide, and I remember that the slopes of the cliffs on both sides were gentle. Although not accurate.None of the canyons I had passed so far matched my memory.And what else was there\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s a canyon.\u201dRodin said as he looked at the scene that appeared in front of us.It was now the fifth gorge they had encountered.\u201c\u2026\u201dUh? Wait a second\u2013.I narrowed my eyes at the shape of the gorge, which somehow seemed to match my vague memories.I was busy moving my gaze and scanning the gorge, but there was a commotion around me. There were also orcs.This time, instead of a few, Rodin and his members frowned at the horde of orcs that protruded in dozens.\u201c\u2026There are a little more this time?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re still just Orcs, though. Arma, prepare a big magic.\u201dAs always, Rodin and his men prepared for battle.\u00a0Still, there were a lot of numbers this time, so they showed a bit of nervousness.But they were still always the first to go into battle\u2026\u201cAsher.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cTake care of everything.\u201dThe orcs were a great hindrance to this situation, where I was trying to remember something.At my words, Asher drew her sword and swung it at the slowly approaching group of Orcs.Chow!The gigantic blue aura that erupted from her sword cut the bodies of the orcs in two at once.Rodin and the members, who were about to go into battle at the sight, instantly became stunned.\u201cUh, uh\u2026\u201dAs the canyon became quiet again, I continued to look around and retrieve my memory.Soon after, I rushed to one side when something came to my mind. Asher followed me.\u2026YesObviously, this was it.I moved while looking at the cliff, just like when I was looking for super regeneration, and stopped at a certain point. And I raised my head.A convex cliff faced high overhead, and a tree standing alone at the edge.The video of the user who got the floating veil clearly had this composition of view.\u201cAsher, try breaking down this wall.\u201dKwaaang!As Asher broke down the wall, the stone fragments came crashing down, revealing a passage inside.Old stone stairs going down.Seeing that, I smiled with joy.I finally found it.This was the dungeon where the mystery of the floating veil was hidden.Rodin and the rest of his group also came up and looked at the entrance, wide-eyed.I told them;\u201cWait here for a while.\u201dLeaving them behind, I went down the stairs with Asher and headed inside.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I sensed something strange and stopped walking.Suddenly, a blue light shone in the statue\u2019s eyes, and he opened them and swung the spear he was holding.Kwak Kwa Kwa Kwam!\u201c\u2026!\u201dGoose bumps ran down my spine at the gigantic aura of blue light that passed right next to me.Then, an inorganic voice flowed from the stone statue.[I warn you. I will consider anyone who crosses that line an intruder.\u00a0Those who don\u2019t deserve to enter, please go back.]\u2026What was that?Wasn\u2019t this a dungeon without a guardian?Confused, I looked down.When I looked at it, I saw that the floor was dented and had a line-like mark.\u00a0Were you going to attack me if I walked over this?Another unexpected situation dumbfounded me, like the one I encountered with Bellevagorah.I had come this far, but something happened like this again?coo coo coo.The expression of Asher next to me hardened, as if she sensed that the energy radiating from the stone statue was unusual.Its level was much higher than Asher\u2019s, so it was impossible for her to deal with it.I thought to myself.Does instant kill work on golems too?That guardian was, at a glance, a magical golem made of magicTo put it bluntly, it was more like an inanimate creature than a living thing, so it was doubtful whether instant death would work.But there was no other way. I had no choice but to try.It\u2019s still the one and only 10-star skill. Shouldn\u2019t it also worked on golems?I took out the arrow I had brought with me, scratched my palm, dipped it in blood, hung it on the string, and aimed at it.***Asher swallowed a gulp as she looked at the stone statue spewing out huge magical energy in front of her.Could she win with all her might? She checked, but she wasn\u2019t sure.What was this dungeon-like space for?\u00a0What was that monster?Although she had great confidence in her abilities and was always regarded as a genius among her clan, she somehow constantly encountered opponents she could not handle when traveling with the Seventh Lord.\u201c\u2026?\u201dShe suddenly looked to the side.It was because the Seventh lord was suddenly aiming at the golem with an arrow on a string.Piiing!When the Seventh Lord let go of the string, the flying arrow hit the body of the stone statue and bounced off helplessly.As she was watching him blankly, he muttered, as if he was sorry.\u201cI tried to aim at the head, but I still lack a lot.\u201d\u2026What the hell were you doing now?When a question arises about an act that seemed to play a joke that did not go well with the situation.The Seventh Lord opened his mouth again.\u201cNow get out of here, stone. Don\u2019t block the road.\u201d\u2026Coooooung!The stone statue lost its balance and fell to the ground.Seeing the scene, Asher\u2019s eyes widened in astonishment.The Seventh Lord put his bow on his back and said.\u201cGo inside.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAsher stared blankly at his back as he moved forward with light steps, then she moved her steps belatedly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Now it was time to claim the reward.Let\u2019s see.On one side of the cavity was a door slightly smaller than the door where the stone statue that had just been demolished was. It must have been that way.The user who I watched from the game video was disappointed in the dungeon without a single item like a relic, but they must have entered that door, discovered the mystery, forgotten about the feeling of loss, and danced in the pants of joy.Come to think of it, it was strange why the mystery was hidden in this dungeon.Mystery was the setting of an unknown power that had nothing to do with mana or magic, and the place where it appeared was completely random.It could be just a crazy coincidence, or there could be a reason I didn\u2019t know about.Of course, that was a good thing.What mattered to me now was the existence of the mystery of the floating veil waiting for me beyond that door.But it\u2019s not just that, right?Suddenly, a possibility came to mind.The timeline of the current world was a point in the past, five years ago in the world played in the game.There\u2019s a possibility that the mystery hadn\u2019t been created yet. So there could be nothing in there?\u201cAsher, break down this door.\u201dI ordered Asher, brushing the ominous assumptions out of my head that I did not want to imagine.Standing behind me, looking around the cavity, she came over and broke down the door.Asher, who was brought here so I could use her as an escort, was actually used more to destroy things.\u201cWait here.\u201dAfter I told her that, I went inside alone.As I went further along the path that was narrower than the corridor, another cavity came out.The only difference was that there were traces of human life here.\u201c\u2026\u201dI looked up and stared at the ceiling, not paying attention to anything else.I was staring at a pattern drawn on the ceiling and shining brightly in white.The corners of my lips rose slowly.Excitement welled up along with relief.\u201cFloating Veil\u2026\u201dMystery was more powerful as the size of the pattern increased.The pattern of the floating veil was much larger than the super-regeneration, so it could not fill the ceiling of the wide cavity and continued to the wall below.I laughed for a moment at the joy of finding the mystery, but soon realized the situation and let out a small sigh.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dCome to think of it, was that painted on the ceiling in the game video?I couldn\u2019t think because I was concentrating on other things.The ceiling of the cavity was high enough to easily exceed several times my height. At a glance, it looked like it was 10 meters.\u2026It should be absorbed only when it was touched, but how should I absorb it?I stared blankly at the ceiling like a dog chasing chickens, then glanced back.Should I go back and get Asher?However, even if it\u2019s Asher, I did not want to show her the existence of a mystery.Was there another way?\u201c\u2026\u201dI turned my gaze to the wall.There were a lot of protruding parts, so I thought I could climb it if I tried hard enough.Ugh.Anyway, there was no easy way to get anything.I let out a sigh and moved closer to the wall.I never thought I would do rock climbing like this, which I had never done before in my life.There was super regeneration anyway, so I didn\u2019t have to worry about getting hurt if I fell, and I my stamina also wouldn\u2019t run out that easily.Holding on clumsily to the protruding part, I climbed slowly, groping.If it was my original physical ability, I would have climbed a few meters and my arms would have trembled, but thanks to super regeneration, the lack of strength was immediately filled.As I slowly and slowly climbed up like that, I was already right under the ceiling before I knew it.If I stumbled once and fell, I had to climb up again, so I carefully fixed my center of gravity, slowly released one hand, and stretched out.Whoa!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

From the moment I got floating veil, I had a sense of what kind of ability it was and how to use it.I stretched out my arms forward for no reason and activated the floating veil.\u201c\u2026!\u201dI couldn\u2019t see it with my eyes, but I could feel a protective barrier spreading around my body.I was amazed for a moment, but then I realized something and immediately recalled my ability.Then I muttered with a slightly puzzled expression.\u201cNo\u2026 was the penalty not being able to breathe?\u201dFloating veil.Absolute defense ability that could block any powerful attack.However, the penalty was that the caster could not take any action while the veil was open.So in the game, it was used as an invincible skill that chewed the boss\u2019s ultimate skill.But when I tried using it myself\u2026 not only could I not move while using this ability, I couldn\u2019t even breathe.I tried the ability once again.As I practiced and used my abilities several times, I soon realized something was different.This did not last continuously once used, but can be canceled at will, and there was no cooldown or activation delay.Unlike in the game, it became an on-off type of ability that could be freely turned on and off.I didn\u2019t know if the form of the ability had changed to match the reality, but it could be said that it was much improved than the game, anyway.However, while the veil was active, no action could be taken, and even breathing was impossible.\u201cI get it roughly.\u201dI thought it was a decent penalty.To be honest, it didn\u2019t feel like a huge penalty to me.Because I didn\u2019t have any ability other than instant kill, so if I tried to use this ability, how would I use it?Wouldn\u2019t I rather use it mostly just to stand still and block my opponent\u2019s attacks, anyway?I just have to hold my breath for a while, and if I have to keep it activated, I can control it by turning it off and on in between.Assuming this and that, I thought about how to use the floating veil in different situations.In addition, it was possible to control the shape and size of the veil.I could spread the veil to stick to my body like armor, or I could spread it around the body in a spherical shape, like a barrier of magic.This was a great defensive ability.\u201cIt\u2019s good.\u201dBesides super regeneration, I felt reassured at the thought that I now had one more means to protect myself.I brushed the dust off my body and looked around.After obtaining the mystery, the scenery of the cavity came into view.There were traces of people\u2019s lives, such as desks and beds.I wandered around and looked around to see if there was anything else I could get, but nothing came of it.After looking around the cavity one last time, I moved toward the aisle.After passing through the passage I passed through and coming out of the first joint, I saw Asher, who was wary of the surroundings.When she saw me, she seemed a little relieved.She was nervous that the same stone statue from earlier would come out.In the end, I did not know what this dungeon was.Maybe this was a dungeon that someone had already robbed, but I thought maybe mystery formed behind it because of an unfortunate coincidence.Whatever it was, I got what I wanted, so I didn\u2019t care anymore.\u201cLet\u2019s go out.\u201dI moved to the aisle leading outside with Asher.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Would she have left us intact here like this?\u201d\u201cSince they don\u2019t know the way back, she might try to kill us after we guide them back\u2013!\u201d\u201cAre you not only an idiot but also a coward?\u201dShien hit Lud\u2019s back with her bow.Of course, what Lud said was just a hypothetical assumption.If not, she would do something stupid by leaving the client behind even before completing the request.\u00a0And she wouldn\u2019t even be able to get 70 gold.She decided to wait a little longer, but then she heard a squishy cry.Orcs appeared one by one again around them.\u201cOh, those orcs again.\u201dWere there any tribes that have settled near this canyon?The expressions of Rodin and his members, who were preparing for battle as if tired of it, slowly turned into dazed faces.This was because the number of Orcs in sight continued to increase.A few to ten, ten to dozens, and dozens to\u2026\u201c\u2026\u201dA group of Orcs filled the area.Among the bushes, on top of the cliffs, orcs continued to appear in the middle of it, and now it completely looked like a green wave.\u201cShit.\u201dNo one could understand what the hell was going on.They all stepped back with pale complexions and not even thinking about raising a weapon.Strangely, there was an orderly atmosphere between the many orcs.Like a well-organized large army, waiting for the leader\u2019s command to lead them.Kruck.A low, clear sound rang out in the stillness.At the ferocious cry that aroused fear, Rodin and his members shuddered thinly.As if one side of the green wave was splitting, the road seemed to open, and something slowly stepped out from between them.A gigantic orc twice as large as the other orcs, and covered in large muscles all over the body.Looking at him, Rodin muttered in disbelief.\u201c\u2026King.\u201dKing.An existence that could unite and lead monsters that cannot be united.They could understand now. How could so many orcs be gathered in one place?Among the orcs of the Tyrell Mountains, the worst mutation that would cause a monster wave was born.The eyes of the Orc King, shining red and bloody, turned to them.It looked like it was full of murderous intent to tear them apart and kill them at any moment.There was no other way to deal with that monster.Even without fighting, everyone could instinctively realize that fact.With orcs all around them, there was only one place to run.As Rodin looked at the entrance to the dungeon next to him, he barely let out his voice.\u201cArma, magic\u2026\u201dArma, who was half lost, suddenly came to her senses and prepared her magic.She was thinking of throwing some kind of magic to slow it down for a moment and then running inside. There was no other way.She pumped all of her magic with all her might.The magic power that was flowing around and clumped together soon rose into flames.The Orc King charged towards them with a heavy volley of feet.A huge fireball the size of a man cut through the air and flew toward the other with fierce force.Whoops!\u201c\u2026Run inside!\u201dEveryone turned and ran toward the entrance of the dungeon.But it was futile.The fireballs fired by Arma didn\u2019t even hit the Orc King, let alone stop it for a moment.It jumped out of the flames and closed the distance between them in an instant before everyone could take a few steps.The first target the Orc King aimed at was Arma, who had cast magic.Rodin, who was right next to her, reflexively threw himself, but was hit and bounced off the cliff, crashing.\u201c\u2026Ah!.\u201dThere was no time to use defensive magic.Then, seeing the huge fist that was about to hit her body, Arma sensed her death and closed her eyes tightly.That was the moment.A gigantic blade of sword flew from inside the dungeon\u2019s entrance and cut down the Orc King.It let out a cry of pain and stepped back, grabbing its bleeding arm.Arma slowly opened her closed eyes.\u00a0The other members also looked at the entrance where the sword force came from.Two people, Ron and Asher, were slowly walking out from inside.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No!\u201dI watched her crying and casting her spell, then I pulled something out of my arms.I know that in order to survive in this world; I have to live selfishly showing no favors.However, I had no intention of living while ignoring the people dying in front of me.\u201cGet out of the way.\u201dI took out the Scarlet Potion and checked Rodin\u2019s condition.The hollow in his chest meant that this was a fatal wound. I poured the potion on it.After a while, his wounds slowly regenerated, and I heard bones and muscles slowly reconstructing.Soon Rodin\u2019s complexion eased, and his breathing returned to normal.The other members were staring blankly at the sight, then they hurriedly bowed to me.\u201cThank you, young master! Really, thank you\u2026!\u201d\u201cOkay, check his status further.\u201dHaving finished my work, I turned my gaze to the side.On one side, the battle between Asher and the Orc King was in full swing.Kwak Kwa Kwa Kwam!\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7It was a battle that was so fast that it was difficult to see the what was going on.Every time Asher and the Orc King clashed, the surrounding ground turned upside down and all they swept away the trees. The wind pressure pushed up to where I was, which was quite far away.Seeing Asher fight properly for the first time made me realize that she, too, was a monster.Bellevagorah, the Guardian who is well over level 80, and the people I met so far were all monsters of a different calibre, so it\u2019s just that I hadn\u2019t been able to properly see Asher\u2019s skill.Asher\u2019s sword raged like a storm, and the Orc King could not fight back and only poured out blood.In fact, if Asher really gave her full power, it would be dead by now.The nine level difference they had was huge.But now, since she didn\u2019t use her racial trait, she was out of power.The battle seemed to take longer than expected, but I thought it would be over soon, so I folded my arms and stared at the fight.It was at one point.Big!The Orc King let out a roaring roar as if preparing for the final clash, then suddenly turned and charged towards usThat also took aback Asher, so she came up behind it a beat late, but it was already close to them.In the blink of an eye, I saw the guy who came right in front of me and immediately used a mystery.Floating veil.An invisible, transparent veil spread between me and the Orc King.Its fist stopped in front of me, and the ground next to me exploded with the impact.\u201c\u2026\u201dIts attack, which would have shattered even a huge rock, did not shock me in the slightest.I still stood with my arms crossed, staring at the bewildered Orc King with nonchalant eyesThat was its last moment.Chow-ah!Asher\u2019s sword followed in an instant and decapitated the Orc King.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She bowed her head with a look of guilt.\u201cSorry.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dI was a bit surprised, but thanks to that, I could confirm the defense power of the floating veil.Looking around, I saw the orcs who had lost their leader, wandering around in confusion.There was no need to ask Asher to kill them because they soon scattered in all directions as if they were running away.Even Orcs would have the intelligence to distinguish who would be annihilated if they attacked.\u201cWhew\u2026\u201dThe adventurers who were standing on the side watching the battle looked relieved.Rodin was also getting up from his the ground, staggering as if he had picked himself up.I told them;\u201cNow let\u2019s go down.\u201dFinding this mystery was also eventful.***After coming down the mountain range and returning to the city, I paid the rest of the request money to the adventure group.Rather, they stubbornly refused, saying that they did not have to receive it in the name of receiving grace, but a promise was a promise, so they were forced to accept it.\u201cThank you very much, young master. I hope you have only glory on the road ahead.\u201dThey thanked me with genuine respect in their eyes.It was a natural reaction, given that I saved their leader\u2019s life using a precious potion and even gave them such a huge amount of money.However, thanks to them, I also successfully got an important defense-type mystery, so I didn\u2019t think it was a waste.And it was only a few hundred golds, anyway.The money I took from my territory was dozens of platinum coins that I now have in my arms.We left the city right after a day.The boring carriage trip began again, and the next destination was the First Lord\u2019s territory ruled by the Wiseman.Thinking of the mysteries to be gained there, I blankly watched the scenery outside the wagon.Then, out of habit, I turned my gaze to Asher, who was sitting across from me.Her expression seemed weakly shadowed.\u201cYour complexion doesn\u2019t look good.\u201dAt my words, Asher looked this way.\u201cDid you have any injuries sustained in battle?\u201d\u201cNo. Just\u2026\u201dAs she licked her lips, her expression became a little darker, she said.\u201cLord Ron appointed me as an escort.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI made a mistake against the Orc King before, not finishing the battle properly.\u201dWas it like that again?Something like this happened when we ran into Bellevagorah before.Whether it was dealing with junk mobs or breaking down walls, she was actually helping me so much that I couldn\u2019t do what I needed to do without her.However, she was having a difficult time because she couldn\u2019t stand up to the really powerful ones.I said nothing about that, but her na\u00efve personality was really\u2026It\u2019s annoying.But, it was also cute.Compared to the first Asher, who seemed like I was facing a wall, this was a great improvement.Didn\u2019t the fact that she bring up such a story and have a conversation with me meant that her trust in me became deeper?I was choosing what to say and then opened my mouth.\u201cI said that when I first met you, that I knew about your abilities.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cBut it was more like talking about your potential, not your current abilities. I know your current limitations. I know what you can do and what you can\u2019t.\u201dI continued talking to Asher, who was listening.\u201cThe snake in the Rutus Mountains and the golem you met in the dungeon were all opponents you couldn\u2019t handle, even with all your might. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve never been disappointed in you yet. Do you understand?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cOf course, it was a mistake to miss the orc.\u201dShe seemed to chew on what I said, then bowed her head.I looked out the window again and watched the passing scenery.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It is said that they mainly sell fried chicken dishes.\u201dWe had dinner there and immediately left the inn.When we arrived at the restaurant and went inside, quite a few people were eating. It had a moderately noisy atmosphere.An employee walking around the hall saw us and greeted us brightly.\u201cWelcome! Are the three of you here for a meal?\u201dThe employee guided me to a seat by the window, and I sat down first, with Asher and Baros sitting across from me.This kind of seating arrangement was awkward at first to Baros, but he got used to it.When I ate at the inn in the city that I first arrived after leaving the territory, I was annoyed that Baros didn\u2019t dare to sit down to eat with me. He would just stand by and wait on me.He was a great man, in charge of all the chores on this journey, but if there was one thing, it was that he was too loyal.The waiter held out the menu and asked.\u201cHow would you like to order? If you are not familiar with our restaurant, please let me explain\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll order three chickens.\u201d\u201cYes, I understand. Cooking takes a little time, so please forgive me!\u201dThis medieval world, especially in a big city like this, had a lot of weirdly modern corners mixed in, like this restaurant.It was a game world created by modern people in the first place, so it was probably just natural.What\u2019s not natural is my situation after entering this game world.Asher was by nature silent, and since Baros was someone I couldn\u2019t have a comfortable conversation with, I thought for a while, waiting for our food.Why did I come into this world?I had not yet found the answer.Come to think of it, a god actually existed in this world.The only god in the world of RaSa who gave the holy sword to the hero of Santea.Maybe, that god could tell me why this happened?\u201c\u2026\u201dWhatever it was, survival was the most important thing right now, so it was just a futile idea.If I continued to survive, I could meet the hero someday. That was something to think about.I leaned back in my chair, feeling a bit of a relief.Then the door opened and two customers came in.A luxuriously dressed woman who seemed to be the daughter of a certain family and her escort knight. But when she looked around the restaurant and frowned, she shouted in a clear voice.\u201cManager! Are you not accepting guests soon?!\u201dIt surprised the manager inside to see her face, and he hurried over.\u201cWelcome, Lady Denbri. It\u2019s an honor to have you visit our store.\u201d\u201cTsk, dirty and sluggish.\u201dThe woman looked around her.\u201cThese days, this restaurant\u2019s cuisine is so famous, so I came to taste it myself while out on an outing, but the inside is dirty and unfashionable.\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s still not enough to welcome the noble young lady.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? Quickly, guide me to the best seat.\u201d\u2026Who was that idiot?As I watched the scene, the atmosphere inside the store suddenly became quiet.All the other guests were paying attention to her.

The presence of an aristocratic class to keep them in check was meaningless.However, there were mayors or commanders who managed cities or fortresses in certain areas. Like the aristocrats of Santea, they form families and inherit positions.Although there was no formal aristocratic class, in reality they could be called the nobles of Calderic.\u201cThen I\u2019ll serve the dish as soon as you ordered.\u201dThe woman in her seat looked around her once again.She patted the fan she was holding in her hand with a sneer as she watched the other guests hurriedly lowered their eyes.Looking at the superiority on her face, she seemed to openly enjoy such reactions.What an ugly woman.That\u2019s what I thought, and I soon turned my attention away from her.It was enough to quietly taste the chicken in another world and go out without paying attention to that woman.Clink!While I was waiting for the food, I ordered to come out, there was a commotion again.This time, too, that woman was the source.\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201dThe waiter who was serving drinks had dropped his glass.And, of course, it dropped near the woman.She looked down at the hem of her dress to see if the drink had splattered on it.Then, her expression soon became distorted with irritation and anger, and she jumped up from her seat and violently slapped the apologetic employee in the face.\u201cOuch\u2026!\u201d\u201cIs this fucking bitch crazy? How dare you dirty my dress?!\u201dAs if one cheek did not satisfy her, she grabbed him by the hair and knocked him down, and trampled him with her feet without mercy.There was no one to stop it.\u00a0The manager, who came out because of the commotion, just watched with a restless expression.\u201c\u2026\u201dI was watching the scene, thinking that the woman was the real crazy bitch in this scenario. Then I saw the expression of Asher sitting in the seat in front of me, getting more and more hardened.Basically good-natured, she was a character who could hardly overlook this kind of injustice.It was the same for me. This one-sided violence was an eyesore.I told her.\u201cI told you before, express your thoughts and opinions.\u201dAsher flinched and turned around.Then she immediately nodded her head and opened her mouth.\u201cCan I help that employee?\u201d\u201cDo whatever you want.\u201dIt was when Asher was about to get up from her seat at my answer\u2026\u201cHey, young lady.\u201dA voice came from somewhere else.It was a young man sitting in a corner seat.As he approached the woman, he sneaked in front of the fallen employee and smiled servilely.\u201cI\u2019m sorry for daring to intervene, but if you forgive him, this employee will be impressed by your generosity. So\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat are you? Aren\u2019t you going to get lost?\u201dThe woman pushed the man away and picked up a glass bottle that was on the table. With that, she seemed to want to hit the waiter on the head.The man was startled and quickly grabbed her arm.Teouk.The escort knight standing next to her also grabbed the man\u2019s arm.I could see how hard the other had squeezed his arm as his face contorted in pain.\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201dThe woman staring in amazement at the hand that gripped her own wrist. She soon shifted her cold gaze to the man.\u201cDid you hold my arm? You dare?\u201d\u201cI, I will remove it at once\u2026\u201d\u201cGerold, cut off his wrists.\u201dThe man\u2019s expression hardened.The knight, without hesitation, brought his hand to the hilt of his sword, as if he were really about to carry out the order.That was the moment.Bang!Asher approached the knight and grabbed his arm.The knight whose arm she grabbed looked back at Asher, frowning at her.He then seemed to give strength as if to shake it off\u2026 but nothing happened.When his arm didn\u2019t budge at all, the knight looked puzzled.\u201cWhat is this again? Do these lowly things keep interrupting me as if they\u2019re crazy?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing, Gerold! Cut this crazy bitch down!\u201dHowever, the knight\u2019s arm was still immovable.Seeing his face completely red from the rush of blood, she seemed to be taken aback as if she had grasped the situation as well. Then she turned her gaze to look in my direction.\u201cHey, black hair over there! This is your escort! Don\u2019t stop quickly?! Do you know who I am?!\u201d\u2026Did she just call me black hair?I couldn\u2019t even laugh because it was ridiculous, but Baros\u2019 expression became rather stern.\u201cYou dare\u2026\u201dHe would summon his spirits and attack at any moment, so I gestured for him to stay still and opened my mouth.\u201cYou\u2019re vulgar.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 What? What?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s so vulgar to see you run amok like a colt with her tail on fire. Stop making a fuss and get lost.\u201dOnly then did Asher let go of the arm she\u2019s holding. The knight took his arm and stepped behind the woman.The woman glared at me to death, and she screamed.\u201cKill! Don\u2019t stay still like an idiot. Kill him right now!\u201dThe knight hesitated, then reached his hand for the hilt of his sword.I told Asher.\u201cIf he draws his sword, cut them both.\u201dTranslator: I'm translating another novel here.

That bastard called me vulgar! Kill him quickly!\u201dShouting loudly, she seemed to have finally lost her mind. It looked like a child throwing a tantrum.It\u2019s annoying, really.I said;\u201cIf it sounds like empty words, pull out your sword. Or take that noisy thing and go away.\u201dThe knight glared at me, then finally removed his hand from the hilt of his sword.He seemed to have realized the difference in his skills after directly competing with Asher.Instead, he opened his mouth and spoke in a menacing voice.\u201cI don\u2019t know who the young master is, but he\u2019s making a big mistake. She\u2019s the daughter of the mayor of this city\u2026\u201dI didn\u2019t reply, but waved my hand at Asher.As she brought her hand to the hilt of her sword, the knight fell silent and shut his mouth.\u201cThis\u2026!\u201dThe woman, who was upset at the sight, trembled as if she couldn\u2019t overcome her anger, and she slapped the knight on the cheek.The knight just silently let her hit him as she slapped his face several times.The woman who had taken her anger out like that turned her gaze back and glared at me ferociously.\u201cYou\u2019re really going to kill me. Do you know who my father is? He\u2019s the mayor of this city. This whole city belongs to my family.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll make sure you pay the price for fooling around with that lowly tongue. You\u2019ll never be able to walk on two legs again without crawling between my legs and begging.\u201dThen she turned around and strode out of the store.Her escort knight also chased her out, and the restaurant fell silent. All eyes were focused on this direction.Ha\u2026That\u2019s really great.Admiring how the other could be that big of an idiot, I looked at the place where she had disappeared.Baros also looked at the door from which she came out with his cold, sunken eyes, and spoke cautiously to me.\u201cJust give me a word and I\u2019ll meet the mayor of this city in person. That cheeky bitch\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t trouble yourself.\u201dThis was not my territory, so I didn\u2019t want to make a fuss.It could reveal my whereabouts to the other Lords, and if that happened, someone might unnecessarily take an interest in me.But since it happened like this, could I do anything?I knew from the moment I intervened, things would get annoying.Thinking of seeing the face of the mayor who raised that great idiot tomorrow, I soon turned off my nerves.\u201cAre you okay?\u201dAsher raised the fallen employee.The manager and other employees who had been watching approached them with belatedly apologetic faces.She handed them over to them, and Asher returned to her seat and sat down with her head bowed shyly.The man who had been standing awkwardly came this way.He was the man who was threatened by that crazy woman, having his wrist cut off and all. Which didn\u2019t happen because Asher intervened.\u201cHey, thank you. Young master has helped me to survive. I almost lived as a disabled for the rest of my life.\u201dI nodded my head as I saw him conveying his thanks with a smile on his face.Judging by his attire, he was a man who looked like an ordinary traveler.Still, he was the only one among those who watched the mad woman\u2019s atrocities and tried to stop it, so his personality seemed pretty good.\u00a0 I was not blaming those who didn\u2019t step up since it\u2019s understandable if they couldn\u2019t.\u2026?But wait a minute\u2026Having felt something familiar, I inspected the man\u2019s face.It\u2019s the same feeling as when I first found Asher.When I stared at him, the man also looked at me with puzzled eyes.I asked him.\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dHe seemed taken aback for a moment, but then responded with a laugh again.\u201cMy name is Lian, young master.\u201dLian.Only then did an NPC character appear in my memory.A blond, green-eyed young man with the same appearance as the one in front of me.Hah\u2026Surprised inwardly but also feeling awed at this bizarre coincidence, I repeated his name in my mind.Not the pseudonym he just mentioned, but the real name he\u2019s hiding.Tair Bamon.The youngest prince of the neutral country, Earth Hill.He was not to the extent of being the main character in the world of RaSa, but he was a person who could be said to be the main character among the supporting actors.The episode of Earth Hill\u2019s Neutral Country related to him was one of my favorite main stories in the game.Yes, since it was five years ago, he had not yet returned to the kingdom and was wandering around Calderic\u2026\u201cI\u2026 the dish is ready.\u201dThe waiter came to the table holding the finished dish.The fried chicken pieces that looked appetizing came out in a basket full of them.I stared at the chicken, then at the table where Lian was sitting, then back to him.And I asked\u201cThis is also a fate. Shall we dine together?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201dWhat kind of nonsense is this? \u2013 That was probably the guy was thinking as his eyes widened.Asher and Barros, who were sitting in the seats in front of me, also looked at me with curious eyes, probably curious why I was doing this.But this was a good opportunityI wanted to have a conversation with him.It was because I thought that there might be something to be gained from this relationship that happened by chance.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I don\u2019t know the details. Whatever it was, the Lord completely captured the merchant group.\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s worrisome. What kind of person do you think the Seventh Lord is? I\u2019ve heard that you\u2019re an outsider.\u201d\u201cHow can I know that I\u2019m just an administrator? I know nothing more than you.\u201dHe was Laika, an administrator belonging to the Seventh Lord\u2019s castle, who stopped by here for a while on business.Also, as you can see, he was also a close friend that a personal acquaintance with Mayor Colton.\u201cHe did nothing other than what he did to the merchant corps. From what I heard, he was looking at a map all day until I left the castle.\u201d\u201cHuh? A map, why\u2026\u201d\u201cThe atmosphere on the side of Santea and the neutral countries has been unusual lately, so it may have something to do with it. I\u2019m already saying too much by mentioning this, so don\u2019t ask too much.\u201dEven if they were the only ones here, they still couldn\u2019t talk lightly about a Lord.The two soon turned to other topics.Then there was a commotion at the entrance of the dining room.Colton tilted his head at the sight of his daughter strutting into the dining room.\u201cYou came back early, my dear. You said you would visit the night market, but the sun hasn\u2019t even set yet.\u201dHis youngest daughter, who was born to his late wife, was a precious treasure to him.Her daughter, Denbri, greeted Laika first.\u201cI\u2019m sorry for interrupting your meal.\u201dLaika nodded his head. He was a little offended, to be honest, but it was okay because he knew Colton cared so much for his youngest daughter.She said to Colton.\u201cDo you know what insult I just went through out there, Father?\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cA lowly person who doesn\u2019t even know the subject dared to tell me I was vulgar! This idiot couldn\u2019t even pull out his sword and just watched!\u201dColton hardened his expression and wiped his mouth with a napkin.Laika also paid attention to the story with an excited expression on his face.It was a fact that no one in the city did not know that Lady Denbri was an unreasonable scumbag. But did she come back after being humiliated by someone?\u201cTell me what happened.\u201dTo that, Denbri explained what had happened at the restaurant.The employee who spilled a drink on her dress, the escort knight, intervening while she was educating the employee, and even the verbal abuse from the knight\u2019s owner.As her explanation continued, Laika looked at her with a slightly bewildered eyes.It dumbfounded him. She would so proudly say that she had committed such atrocious violence for such a small thing.Colton\u2019s expression was more serious.What mattered to him was the insult she suffered, not her behavior.\u201cDo you know who that bastard is?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. He must be from a filthy family.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so humiliated that I\u2019m going to die, Father. I can\u2019t live without him beating his head to the floor and apologising.\u201dColton asked Gerold, the escort knight, standing next to her.\u201cHow was that knight\u2019s skill? Be honest.\u201d\u201c\u2026She was much stronger than me. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dHe bowed his head as if he was sorry.Colton sighed and stroked his chin.Gerold was a knight with sufficiently excellent skills. That\u2019s why he was given as an escort for his youngest daughter.If the man involved was being escorted by a much better knight than him, he would, of course, not be an ordinary person.Maybe not nobles from neighboring family, but nobles from another Lord\u2019s territory or some distant city?\u201cOkay. Wait.\u201dDenbri\u2019s expression brightened at Colton\u2019s words.He didn\u2019t know which family he came from, but at least in this city, Colton was like a king.But did that man dare to insult her daughter and even order her to be cut down?\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d\u201cWhatever it may be, I have to bring that man here.\u201dColton gave a simple answer to Laika\u2019s question.He was thinking of bringing them to the mansion and seeing his face to find out which family he belonged to.And if it\u2019s someone who belonged to a high family, he would suggest to solve things gently, otherwise I would make him pay for his actions.\u201cHow do they look?\u201d\u201cThe man had black hair and the escort knight was a white-haired woman.\u201dColton immediately called the knights and ordered them to find the two people and bring them to him.Meanwhile, Laika, who was listening from the side, tilted his head.A black-haired man and a white-haired female knight? Why was that\u2026What nonsense am I thinking?Immediately dismissing it as an absurd imagination, he burst out laughing.\u00a0I thought it was a pretty strange coincidence.It made little sense. Why would the Seventh Lord, who should be in his territory, suddenly be here in the Fifth Lord\u2019s territory?In any case, Laika thought he had a pretty interesting spectacle to watch, and waited for the knights to come and bring the fearless ones.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thanks to the young master, I\u2019m now able to eat this.\u201dAs he picked up a chicken leg with his hand and brought it to the plate in front of him, the expressions on Asher's and Baros\u2019 faces changed.Originally, it\u2019s okay to pick it up with your hands\u2026I wanted to eat comfortably, but I had to use a fork because it\u2019s a matter of dignity.As I took one leg, the other two also took their share.Asher, who was unfamiliar with the food, did not dare to put it in her mouth and just stared at the part of the thigh that she had taken, and then she cut off the tip with a knife and ate it.She then looked a little startled and started eating faster and faster. It seemed to suit her taste.It tastes good.It was chicken with its own unique taste different from the familiar taste.How could a dish with fried meat not taste good?As we ate in silence for a while, the manager served drinks we didn\u2019t even order.\u201cThank you so much for helping the waiter. I won\u2019t charge you for the food, so please enjoy it.\u201dAfter saying that, he looked at me with a worried look and continued talking.\u201cHey, young master. Lady Denbri, whom you had a quarrel with earlier\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, just go to work.\u201dHe seemed to try to warn me about that idiot.The manager backed away hesitantly, and Lian, who had chicken bones piled up on the plate in front of him, asked me.\u201cBut would you really be all right with young master? If her father is the mayor, wouldn\u2019t he be like the king of this city?\u201d\u201cIf you knew that, why did you try to help the waiter?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 no matter the situation is, I can\u2019t just watch people being beaten like that. And to be honest, I didn\u2019t even know if that woman was the mayor\u2019s daughter. I\u2019m not from this city.\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t you help if you knew?\u201d\u201cNo, I would still have stepped out and help. Of course, I didn\u2019t expect my hand to be cut off, haha.\u201dHe laughed and talked, as if he was talking about someone else and not himself.As one could see, this man had such an optimistic personality.Even in the game, he smiled like this until right before he met his end.\u201cBut she seemed to be a, well, weird woman. I know this is off-topic, but it might be better for you to leave the city as soon as possible, young master\u2026\u201dI turned the topic to something else.\u201cLooking at your behavior, you seem to be a wanderer.\u201d\u201cAh, yes. I\u2019m wandering around Calderic right now.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cIf you ask me why\u2026 What is the reason for the wandering of a traveler?A smile hung on his lips, but somehow it sounded a little empty.Because I knew what his situation was now.Even if he went back, anyone would not welcome him, and he couldn\u2019t bear to completely sever his kinship with his family.Of course, what I was paying attention to right now was not his background, but something else.The reason I was holding onto him and having a conversation was because there was something I wanted to confirm.[Hmm? How did I spot the enemy ambush when there was no sign? Haha, because I have a good sense.][Okay, you\u2019ve helped me a lot, so I\u2019ll let you know in particular. Don\u2019t tell anyone, please keep it a secret. In fact, I have a mystery.]In the Earth Hill Kingdom episode, during the war with the enemy, this was the line that Lian, or Tair Bamon, gave to the player.It\u2019s not exact, but I remembered him saying something like this.He was an extremely rare mystery user on this continent.He meant that there was a mystery that he held like me.He said, \u2018I don\u2019t know what its name was. It was a mystery that amplified my senses and reflexes.\u2019Thanks to his mystical abilities, he was never caught or ambushed by the enemy during the war.He also defeated enemy generals much stronger than himself, even with his not-so-great physical abilities.There was one thing I wanted to checkWas this the point before or after he gained the mystery?[How did I get the mystery? That was just a coincidence.][There was a time when I was wandering around the continent until a few years ago.\u00a0I also worked as an adventurer, and I also explored uninhabited areas.][Somehow, at an antique store, a torn map was touted as a treasure map. It was a map showing the location of a dungeon. And that\u2019s where I got mysteries.]As I recalled, he said he got a mystery from a dungeon marked on the map.He roughly mentioned the location in the dialogue, but unfortunately I couldn\u2019t remember that far.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Or a place where ruins are hidden.\u201d\u201cYou mean dungeons or ruins. I\u2019ve been looking for them, but unfortunately I haven\u2019t found one yet. Ah, I just remembered a story\u2026\u201dThen, with an expression as if thinking of something, Lian took something out of his bosom.An old-looking parchment that was rolled up.He said with a laugh.\u201cThis is the map I bought at the antique shop I stopped by in the city before, but the owner said it might be a treasure map pointing to where the ruins are hidden.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dI hid my surprise and looked at the map. No way?It was to the point where I wondered if there was such a coincidence in such a perfect situation.\u201cIt\u2019s absurd. I tried to open it for no reason, but tore it up a little, so I was forced to buy it for a few silver coins. But since I bought it, I thought I\u2019d visit it as it was on the map, so I was heading there.\u201d\u201cCan I look?\u201d\u201cAs much as you like.\u201dLian obediently handed me the parchment and turned his attention back to the chicken.I slowly unfolded it and examined it.A map so crude and sloppy that I couldn't believe that the contents were real.The location showed by the map was a place between the Fifth and Fourth Lords\u2019 territories, but there was a strange code-like character written on it.\u2026Is this really true?No matter how I looked at it, it looked like scribbled garbage..After examining the map, I turned my attention back to Lian.Anyway, if this was a map that would lead me to the place where the real mystery was hidden, as I remembered, and if I get that mystery.It did not differ from swallowing the mystery he would have gained in the future.\u201cI will buy this map again. Do you intend to sell it?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201dLian looked at me in surprise.Then he immediately clapped his hand and said.\u201cSheesh, no. If you\u2019re interested, just take it. I\u2019ve also received favors from the young master.\u201d\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t you think this could be a map where a real ancient artifact is hidden?\u201d\u201cThen there\u2019s nothing special. If you really find even an ancient magic artifact, young master, please use it favorably, haha.\u201dHe didn\u2019t even seem to think that this was really a treasure map.\u2026Even so, my conscience stings a little to be honest.But I couldn\u2019t be arguing about that right now.If I was going to feel guilty every time something like this happened in the first place, I would not be able to properly use the knowledge of the future.After I got the map and we finished our meal, we said goodbye to him in front of the store.\u201cThen thank you, young master. I\u2019ll go first.\u201dI turned my body and looked at his back as he moved his steps, and I fell into trouble for a moment.Could we just end this meeting like this?The future war between neutral countries was an event that had a significant impact on the power structure of Calderic and Santea.There\u2019s nothing I could do about it by meddling in it right now.

Go back to where you belong before it\u2019s too late.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd if you really feel you can\u2019t handle it, send a messenger to the Seventh Lord\u2019s castle. Depending on the situation, maybe I can help Earth Hill.\u201dI left only those words and turned away from him, who stood there in a daze.Asher and Baros followed me.I don\u2019t know if that guy will return to the kingdom right away with just this\u2026The minimum link was made, so the rest was up to his choice.***Back at the inn, I looked at the map again.The location was in the forest area between the Fifth and Fourth Lords, so the path was not twisted.It will take a long time to find this too\u2026It was nice to have one more mystery to get, but I felt tired already when I thought the hardships would increase much more.I was about to lie down on the bed, but there was a commotion outside.Knock knock.Soon, a knock rang.\u201cCome in.\u201dCarefully opening the door, Baros glanced outside with a firm expression.\u201cThe mayor\u2019s knights came to the inn.\u201dAt those words, I immediately understood the situation.The sound of coming up the stairs echoed, and a series of knights appeared behind them. Asher blocked their way.The knight standing at the forefront looked at Asher with a frown, then shifted his gaze to me and said.\u201cIs that the person who insulted Miss Denbri?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cLooks like it\u2019s right. The mayor has given the order to bring young master. Please, I hope you will follow obediently.\u201dI immediately grasped the situation and let out a blank laugh.I was going to go there when the day was bright, but they found me right away like this.\u201cGuide me.\u201dLet\u2019s see how far they would go.I said that and shook my head.***\u201cThey say they are in the mansion's hall right now, Mayor.\u201d\u201cI get it.\u201dThe attendant reported bringing in a thug who insulted his daughter. Colton nodded his head.Denbri, who was sitting next to him, was also excited and jumped up from her seat.At that sight, Administrator Laika clicked his tongue inwardly and turned to Colton.\u201cCan I come and see him too?\u201d\u201cDo whatever you like.\u201dAs he moved to the hall of the mansion, he saw three people standing in the middle.Denbri spotted the man standing in the middle and raised her eyebrows.The man also spotted her and met her eyes.She said with a wicked grin.\u201cDid we just meet again? I said you\u2019d pay the price, did I?\u201dColton was about to open his mouth as he looked around at the man and the two people standing on either side of him.\u201cYou insulted my daughter\u2026\u201dHe turned his head when he heard a sudden gasp next to him.Laika was looking at them with an expression as if he had seen a ghost. He shuddered all over his body as if he had suddenly caught a chill.Then he soon fell on his knees and bowed his head.\u201cI meet the Seventh Lord!\u201d\u2026What?Colton stopped thinking for a moment because he didn\u2019t understand what he just heard.Denbri, who was happily contemplating what kind of hell to show that damn guy, also made a stupid face.\u201c\u2026Lord?\u201dA terrible silence fell in the hall.The elf frowned and looked at Laika, who had his head bowed to the floor, then spoke cautiously to the man.\u201cThis is Laika, the Administrator of the Seventh Lord\u2019s Castle. It seems that he was on a business trip to this city.\u201dThe man, the Seventh Lord, nodded and went over to one chair in the hall and sat down.\u201cYou must have called me because you had something to say.\u201dHe glanced over at Colton and the others, who stood still.\u201cSince you have summoned me like this, let\u2019s hear what you want to say.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The reason I stayed with the mayor was because I had a personal relationship with him\u2026 He said he would bring those who insulted his daughter back to the mansion to resolve the situation. I followed him out of curiosity to observe. I never dared to imagine that you would be in this city. I am sorry.\u201dIn fact, Laika felt really unfair.\u00a0The situation was equally confusing.For him, who was enjoying a brief retreat in Wilpeck, the situation came as a whirlwind. No, it wasn\u2019t even a lightning bolt; it was a disaster.It was only because he knew the face of the Seventh Lord that he could act quickly with his survival instinct as soon as he saw them.How could he have imagined that the Seventh Lord had left his territory and were in this city out of nowhere, and that he was the one who had a quarrel with the daughter of the mayor?Of course, he couldn\u2019t ask the Seventh Lord, so there was only one thing Laika could do. He prostrated himself so that sparks would not fly to him.Baros said, frowning.\u201cAnyway, didn\u2019t you just watch the situation and try to enjoy it as a game?\u201d\u201cThat, that\u2019s\u2026\u201dCold sweat broke out on Laika\u2019s back.\u201cNo\u2026 is this\u2026 uh\u2026?\u201dMeanwhile, Denbri, who was still muttering with a puzzled expression, turned to Colton.Baros\u2019 gaze turned to those two this time.Because the Lord had decided to just mercifully do nothing, he had no choice but to watch that stupid girl walked away scathe free from the restaurant.But she even dared to call the knights to this place even though the Lord had already given her one leniency?\u201cMayor, will you continue to stand like that?\u201dColton, who suddenly came to his senses, grabbed Denbri by the shoulders and knelt on the floor.The biggest crisis came to the mayor\u2019s life, which had suffered little for over 20 years.Denbri, who was forced to kneel with him, reflexively frowned. She had never been on her knees since she was born.She was completely taken aback, and when she saw Colton\u2019s expression, she shut her mouth.\u201cMy apologies\u2026 Seventh Lord.\u201dThe Seventh Lord tilted his head to the side.\u201cI thought you called me here to tell me something, but what are you doing on your knees?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I dared not know the great One and committed great disrespect.\u201d\u201cTsk.\u201dThe voice of the Seventh Lord grew even colder.\u201cI told you to tell me why you called me. Are you going to keep doing that like a parrot?\u201dColton bit his lip hard.What could he say? Could he say that he was going to make the arrogant guy who dared to scorn her daughter pay for his crimes?The other already knew everything, but the Lord was making him spit it out of his mouth himself.Dead.He\u2019s really dead.The family could perish right here and now. Even if the Seventh Lord tried to do so, no one could stop him.What about the Fifth Lord when she heard about this later? Would she be furious that he had wreaked havoc in her territory and killed the mayor?No, even if she heard the circumstances, she wouldn\u2019t care.In Calderic, a Lord was such a being.No one but the same Lord dared to look at them at eye level, and if you tried to climb, they would trample you to death like an insect, no matter how high of a position you might hold.Colton slammed his head on the floor instead of answering. Not just once, but repeatedly.\u201cI have committed a mortal sin!\u201dBang bang!Looking at Colton, who was constantly banging his head with his forehead shattered and blood flowing from it, Denbri, who was next to him, shuddered.It was because it was only then that she realized the seriousness of the situation when she saw her father, who did not differ from an emperor in Wilpeck, act like this.No matter how much she lived like no one could stop her, she knew what the status of a Lord meant in Calderic.\u201cMayor, please stop. You dare in front of the Lord\u2026\u201dBaros narrowed his eyes. He immediately cut off the mayor\u2019s words and stepped back.\u201cMayor.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is the third time. Explain why you called me here.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The best thing to do was just do what he was told, and pray that he would die a comfortable death.\u201c\u2026I heard that someone had insulted my daughter, so I intended to bring him back here and make him pay for it.\u201dThe Seventh Lord said.\u201cDid you get all the details on why that happened?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201cTell me.\u201d\u201cA waiter spilled a drink on my daughter\u2019s dress, so while my daughter was educating the waiter\u2026\u201d\u201cEducation. Is that what it\u2019s called when you wield violence so ruthlessly over something like a stain on your clothes?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cShe even tried to slit the wrists of the person who stopped her. If that\u2019s education, then what do you think is appropriate education for me in this situation? Here, the mayor of a border city ordered his knights to bring the Lord to him by force.\u201dColton flinched.The eyes of the Seventh Lord turned to Denbri.\u201cDid you say that you would make me unable to walk on my two legs without me crawling between yours?The complexion of Colton and Laika, who were lying down, became more swarthy. Did you even say such a thing?Denbri couldn\u2019t hold back the fear and said with tears dripping down her face.\u201cNow, I made a mistake. Lord. Help me. Help me\u2026\u201dThe Seventh Lord shook his head.\u201cI was planning to just let you off since I didn\u2019t want to make a fuss in another Lord\u2019s territory.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve committed a mortal sin\u2026\u201d\u201cI still have the same thoughts. I\u2019m too lazy to make a fuss over such a ridiculous thing.\u201dHowever, at the words that followed, Colton\u2019s face turned pale.\u201cSince it happened in her territory, the Fifth Lord will take care of it later.\u201d\u2026That too was tantamount to a death sentence.What would happen if this news reached the ears of the Fifth Lord?It didn\u2019t matter what the relationship between the Seventh Lord and the Fifth Lord was.It was unacceptable that the likes of a mayor dared to insult a Lord in the slightest.Even if the Seventh Lord didn\u2019t use his hands right away, it was a predetermined future that the Fifth Lord would directly punish them herself.The Seventh Lord rose from his seat.As if everything he had to say was finished, he turned to the entrance of the hall.When Baros glanced around, the knights standing around him hurriedly knelt one by one.The Seventh Lords stopped walking for a moment and looked back.\u201cIf you\u2019ve lived trampling on others with such unreasonable power, you should have been prepared to be trampled on like this someday, don\u2019t you think?\u201dThere was nothing Colton could answer to the words of the Seventh Lords.The figures of the Seventh Lords and his two attendants slowly moved away from the hall toward the exit.***By leaving the mansion, I completely turned my attention away from the mayor.I had no intention of punishing them or anything like that in the first place.It\u2019s not that I was showing mercy, it\u2019s just that I felt embarrassed to have my hands stained with blood for something like this.And anyway, even if I did nothing, if this incident reached the ears of the Fifth Lord, the mayor and Denbri would\u2026 whatever it was, it would be a terrible end.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dIt was late at night.Returning to the inn, I looked at the map I received from Tair again.Also, I compared and matched the map with the map of the Fifth Lord\u2019s territory to identify the location of the map in more detail. With the help of Baros, of course.\u201cThere\u2019s a forest on the northwestern border of the Fifth and Fourth Lords. That seems to be the point marked on this map.\u201dA slight detour from the path, but it didn\u2019t matter as long as the mystery could be obtained.I stroked my chin and looked back at Tair\u2019s map.But what is this letter?Unknown strange characters written on one side of the map. Was it a password?This also seemed to have something to do with the destination, but I couldn\u2019t figure out what it meant.Oh, Tair could have known, so he should have asked. I was so distracted by the map that I couldn\u2019t even pay attention.As I stared at the text, Baros spoke again.\u201cThe forest, the greatest tree, when even the twilight completely subsides, it is written that lifeless branches will guide adventurers.\u201d\u201c\u2026?!\u201dI looked back at him in amazement.\u201cCan you read this?\u201d\u201cYes. One of the ancient cipher characters.\u201dI looked at him with eyes asking how he knew that, and the answer came back.\u201cI know a little about ancient letters because I was interested in exploring ruins while working as an adventurer in the past.\u201d\u201c\u2026Right.\u201dThere\u2019s really nothing he couldn\u2019t do.The reason he was so good at Calderic\u2019s geography was because he had such a past.By the way\u2026 the biggest tree?I pondered for a moment and tried to interpret the meaning of the sentence.Was the \u2018biggest tree\u2019 pertaining to the biggest tree in the forest, and \u2018when twilight has completely subsided\u2019 meant night time?But what was the last \u2018lifeless branch\u2019?\u201cDo you know what the \u2018lifeless branch\u2019 meant?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201dI asked Baros again, but he seemed to not know what it meant.As I turned my gaze to Asher, she stood there a little dazed, pretending to think quickly, then shook her head.\u2026I\u2019ll have to see for myself.Then, the immediate goal was set.Go to the forest marked on the map and find the biggest tree.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Because Tair said so.The difference between a ruin and a dungeon was whether there was a risk factor or not.If there were only hidden treasures, it was a ruin, and if there were dangers such as guardians or traps, it was a dungeon. Just like when I was looking for the floating veil last time.The dungeon I had to find this time was a place I had no information about, so the danger was unknown.It\u2019s said that Tair accidentally broke through the dungeon and found the mystery, so it doesn\u2019t sound like a very dangerous dungeon\u2026Tair was only at level 20, so there was a high probability that the level of the dungeon was at that level.Of course, it\u2019s just speculation, and in the end, nothing was certain unless I experienced it myself.Aside from the risk, there was also the problem of deciphering the code and then finding the dungeon.Time passed, and we arrived at Oron City, on the northwestern border of the Fifth Lord\u2019s territory.This time we arrived quite early in the day, so we could grab a lodging and I went straight to the adventurer\u2019s guild to hire a guide.If they described it as the biggest tree in the forest, it would mean that it was so big that it would stand out, so I wondered if there would be many people who knew about it.Upon entering the guild building, the hall was buzzing with overflowing adventurers.I looked around for a moment and then spoke in a slightly louder voice.\u201cI will hire the best guide who meets the conditions for 10 gold.\u201dPop.Like a miracle, the noise stopped, and all eyes turned this way.I wondered if everyone had heard it correctly, but I spoke again as they were making faces that seemed concerned.\u201cI\u2019ll hire a guide for 10 gold. Does anyone know of the biggest tree in the Northwest Border Forest?\u201dEvery time I hired a guide; I ended up spending money.Well, there was an abundance of money, and it\u2019s the most effective way, so what about it?The adventurers seemed to look at each other, but soon words came out one by one.\u201c\u2026Are you talking about the Mengrodi tree?\u201d\u201cI think you\u2019re right. What else could be the tallest tree in the Northwest Forest?\u201dLooking at the reactions, it was a famous tree that everyone knew about.It was a good thing.\u00a0At least I wouldn\u2019t have a hard time finding the tree.\u201c\u2026Hire me! I know very well where the Mengrodi tree is!\u201dSoon, an adventurer raised his hand and shouted.Starting with him, other adventurers also intervened one by one.\u201cYou\u2019re fucking shit. How many adventurers in this city don\u2019t know that place!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m much better than that guy! I can guide you to your destination quickly and safely!\u201dIn an instant, even the employment auction hall became open, and I could see the staff at the counter perplexed.I said a bit of my apologies to them. Did this cause too much of a fuss?Just then, we heard a loud cry from above.\u201cShut up everyone! You said you would hire the best adventurer!\u201dThe mouths of the adventurers who were making a fuss shut their mouths all at once at the gruesome voice, like a beast roaring.I looked upstairs.At the same time, someone jumped off the railing and came down.[Lv.\u00a0 41]A beastman woman with scars all over her bare skin, carrying several short swords around her waist.\u201cSir, I\u2019m the best here, so hire me.\u201dShe strode towards me and said with a confident smile.Among adventurers, talents over level 40 were quite rare. Was she a first-class adventurer?\u201cNo, Railo\u2026 you can receive so many other requests. Isn\u2019t it too much to take such a request?\u201dAn adventurer raised a disgruntled voice.But when the woman turned her gaze to him and glared at him, he instantly shook and withdrew.\u201cWell, you idiots. If you\u2019re complaining, do you think your skills are better than mine? You\u2019ll get 10 gold after guiding the road with those skills? Have you lost your conscience?\u201dThere were no adventurers who expressed their dissatisfaction further. They either frowned or sighed and turned around as if they had given up.It was harsh, but not wrong. All the commissions one received were proportional to their skills.Turning her gaze back to me, she introduced herself with a slightly business-like smile.She said, \u201cI am Railo, a first-class adventurer. There is no adventurer more skilled than me in Oron City, so you will not regret hiring me.\u201dI nodded and took the money out of my pocket.\u201cHere\u2019s half the down payment.\u201dRailo smiled when she was handed the five gold coins.\u201cWhen are you planning to leave?\u201d\u201cIf possible, right now.\u201d\u201cOkay. Then let\u2019s go right away.\u201dSo I quickly hired a guide who seemed pretty good at her job.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It could be because she was annoyed by the noisy Railo.\u201cOh, I made a lot of noise. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dShe soon calmed down and looked out the window, as if she had noticed Asher\u2019s reaction.She then asked me after a while.\u201cBy the way, can you tell me why you are looking for the Mengrodi tree?\u201dWas she asking that now?If she was going to check who the client was and what the purpose of the request was, it would have been normal to check before accepting the request.Or would she accept any request without hesitation, knowing that she would get caught up in something dangerous?This adventurer named Railo seemed to have that much confidence in her own skills. Looking at the level, it was probably true.I was going to just say whatever, but I changed my mind.Come to think of it, was there any reason to hide it this time?Maybe she could even help find the dungeon. Even if she tried to do something, Asher was here.\u201cHave you ever explored a dungeon?\u201dRailo answered my sudden question.\u201cA few times. Why do you ask that?\u201d\u201cGoing to the Mengrodi tree is to search for a dungeon.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 was it like that?\u201dI nodded my head.\u201cHonestly, I had a rough idea. Most of the men who ask for directions to some unexpected places are looking for ruins.\u201dIt seemed like she had taken on this type of request quite a few times.I asked again.\u201cIs there a lifeless branch associated with the tree called Mengrodi?\u201d\u201c\u2026Lifeless branch? Well, I\u2019ve never heard of such a thing.\u201dRailo tilted her head, but soon became interested.\u201cIs that a code related to the dungeon? Finding a dungeon with a code is a lot of fun.\u201dAfter saying that, she murmured the word lifeless branch, deep in thought, and then brushed her hair.\u201cAnyway, finding a dungeon makes work much more fun. After guiding you to the tree, can I continue to help you? Of course, I have no intention of accepting more commission money.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, but if we find a dungeon, I have no intention of letting you explore the inside.\u201dAt that, Railo giggled.\u201cPlease give me an extra pay based on how much you think I\u2019ve been helpful. And to be honest, I expect little. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, finding ruins is a waste. What do you think?\u201dThat\u2019s right.I took things a little too easily, perhaps because I was consistently successful in finding mysteries.Dungeon was actually not that easy to find.***After arriving in the forest, we got off the wagon and started moving.Baros had to guard the wagon, so we left him it at the entrance of the forest and I went inside with Asher. Railo took the lead and guided the way.\u201cBut isn\u2019t it funny when you think about it?\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it said that dungeons are legacy left by ancient mages? But then, they could just pass it on to their disciples and let them inherit it. Instead, they made dungeons could kill trespassers who tried to get their treasures.\u201dWell, those dungeons could be made by mages who didn\u2019t have disciples to succeed them.Or maybe eccentric mages just made it out of boredom.In the first place, it was just the setting of the game, so I never mulled over about it.It\u2019s enough to attach the background in moderation, and rather, it\u2019s strange if there were no dungeons in RPGs.As they went deeper into the forest, monsters gradually appeared.A giant rat, bigger than a human, appeared blocking the way. Was it a Giant Rat?I didn\u2019t know what monsters appeared in this forest.No matter how much I played RaSa, I didn\u2019t know all the monsters that appeared in this ordinary forest without a name.Railo approached Giant Rat with a tap on her neck.Crackling!It roared and lunged at me with an intrusive cry.Railo, who had stomped her foot, swung her fist without drawing her sword.The Giant Rat, which bounced away with a sound like something exploded, had its head smashed to death.Railo said, shaking off her fist with a slightly refreshed face.\u201cLet\u2019s keep going.\u201dAfter that, we rarely encountered other monsters. Even if we ran into them, it was only about level 10 trash mobs like Giant Rats.It seems that there aren\u2019t many monsters here in the first place.By the time the sun went down, we reached our destination.It took little time because the forest wasn\u2019t that big.\u201cNow, this is the Mengrodi tree.\u201dI looked up at the huge tree in front of me and admired it a little.I expected it to be the biggest tree in the forest, but it was much bigger than I had imagined.It was several tens of meters tall, and the circumference was wide enough for ten people to stand hand in hand.After touching the surface of the tree for a moment, I turned my gaze to the sun setting in the sky.The sun is setting just now\u2026The mightiest tree, when the twilight has completely subsided, the lifeless branches.These were the three keywords of this dungeon search.The biggest tree was here, and the time was soon to be night, and all that was left was the \u2018lifeless branches\u2019\u2026What the hell is a lifeless branch?I raised my gaze to the dizzying branches of the Mengrodi tree.As I did that, Asher and Railo started looking at the branches as well.Then, suddenly, Asher opened her mouth.\u201cHey, look at that.\u201dShe stared somewhere behind me and pointed with her finger.I looked to where she was pointing, but couldn\u2019t see anything. I narrowed my eyes.What\u2019s there\u2026\u201c\u2026!\u201dI immediately widened my eyes.A single twig intermingled among the lush branches.However, upon closer inspection, it was different. Because only that branch had no leaves.Was that a \u2018lifeless branch\u2019?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 62": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Fell into the Game with Instant KillCH 29.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cHuh? Only that branch has no leaves. It\u2019s amazing.\u201dRailo also put her palm on her forehead and looked at the bare branches.I furrowed my brows and was lost in thought.A lifeless branch.It must have meant that tree branch.If not, what else could it be?\u00a0 It was an unnatural sight no matter who looked at it.But how is such a thing possible?Was it just the genetic characteristic of the tree, or did the creator of the dungeon who left the code did something to this tree?I skipped it because it wasn\u2019t really important.Rather, if it was a \u2018lifeless branch\u2019, it meant that it was the most decisive hint to find the dungeon.Because the code says that a lifeless branch would guide adventurers.\u201c\u2026\u201dI stared up at the branch.What and how could a branch attached to a tree guide me?I thought for a moment. Maybe if it was cut down, the branches would fly around and give directions\u2026 But it didn\u2019t seem like that\u2019s the case no matter how much this was a fantasy world.Direction? Is it a direction?I thought of something simpler.Were you just telling me to move in the direction the branch was extending?It was confusing, but I couldn\u2019t think of anything else, so I moved. If it wasn\u2019t the case, then I could just come back.I looked back at the two and said.\u201cLet\u2019s move over there.\u201dThat\u2019s how we headed in the direction the branch was pointing.The sun had completely passed before I knew it, and darkness fell over the forest.I took out the glowstone and walked, carefully examining my surroundings. I didn\u2019t know where there might be traces suggesting the location of the dungeon.After moving for several tens of minutes, something that clearly stood out came into view.A single tree among the other trees emitted a sense of presence. Its leaves were dimly shining.\u2026Luminous tree?Railo also found it and muttered in wonder.\u201cIt\u2019s a luminous tree. It\u2019s hard to see, but who would think it was in this forest too?\u201dAs the name suggested, the luminous tree was a tree with leaves that emitted light at night. Like fireflies.It was located exactly on the route we were walking on, so there was something suspicious about it.Could it be that?When the twilight subsided, the reason the time of the day was included in the code.If interpreted differently, it meant that something specific that could only be seen at night was a hint to the dungeon.And the luminous tree was a tree that emitted light like this only at night.Feeling something connected in my head, I moved closer to the luminous tree.Hmm\u2026So what\u2019s next?I moved in the direction where the lifeless branch was pointing to and found a luminous tree standing there.\u00a0What more did I have to do?I asked Railo.\u201cDo you know something?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cThe biggest tree, when the twilight has completely subsided, the lifeless branches will guide the adventurers. So I moved to the direction where that branch of the Mengrodi tree was pointing, and this luminous tree appeared. It seems to be a signpost to the dungeon. Let me know if anything comes to mind.\u201dRailo stood there looking dumbfounded before she asked.\u201cI don\u2019t know? More than that, why do you say this is a signpost to the dungeon?\u201d\u201cWhat else stands out at night other than this?\u201dShe seemed to think about it again, but then she looked surprised as if she realized it only then.\u201cIndeed, that\u2019s it! Could you please explain?\u201d\u201c\u2026Have you really done a lot of dungeon explorations?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m better at using my body, and my other colleagues are good at using their brain.\u201d\u201cWhere are your friends now?\u201d\u201cAfter finding one artifact and having a big meal, everyone retired. I\u2019m an adventurer because it\u2019s my calling, so I\u2019m still active.\u201dSuch a story.Anyway, Railo didn\u2019t seem to be of much help.I wasn\u2019t expecting anything, but I asked Asher as well.\u201cDo you think of anything?\u201dAsher seemed to think hard, then she carefully opened her mouth.\u201cThat\u2026 it\u2019s not.\u201dBut instead of speaking to me, she shook her head.One of the two ways to piss people off was to stop suddenly talking when they were about to say something.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, tell me.\u201dI urged her to speak again.\u201cI heard that most dungeons and ruins are located underground.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dSince ancient times to modern times, people had excavated more relics because the remains on the ground were more noticeable than underground.\u201cThat\u2019s why I thought maybe there\u2019s a dungeon hidden right under this tree.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt was a very simple opinion.But so what? It seemed reasonable.\u201cAh, that\u2019s a bit. How could they hide it so blatantly like that?\u201dRailo interjected and said.My reason for having doubt was the same as hers, but my intuition leaned in favor of Asher\u2019s opinion.After thinking about it, I ordered Asher.\u201cDig deep right in front of the tree until I tell you to stop.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAsher gestured to Railo, who was standing still, to step back.Railo, who stood next to me, looked at me as if it what I ordered was just absurd.\u201cAre you sure about this?\u201d\u201cNothing else comes to mind.\u201d\u201cNo matter how deep she dug, who would\u2026\u201dKwaaiang!The sound of the explosion hitting her ears startled Railo, and she looked back.Every time Asher struck with her fist, the ground burst open and the hole got deeper and deeper.Railo stared at the absurd sight.Time passed.Asher, who had been digging the ground for a long time, suddenly jumped over the pit and she said.\u201cSomething like a stone wall appeared and there\u2019s a space inside.\u201d\u201c\u2026Stone walls?\u201dI moved closer to the pit, put the glowstone above it, and looked down. She dug too deep.It was dark, so I couldn\u2019t see it well, but as Asher said, the artificial stone walls seemed to be faintly visible.So, it\u2019s real?I was dumbfounded and laughed out loud.Did the guy who created the dungeon think no one could really find it?Even after I found it, I was amazed at how the hell Tair found it.\u201c\u2026?\u201dI tilted my head.Wait a minute, wasn\u2019t something inconsistent?Even if you estimate the depth of the hole Asher had dug, it was well over a few meters.So, Tair, like Asher, dug this deep alone and found that\u2026 Did that make sense?\u201c\u2026\u201dI felt a strange sense of difference, as if something was out of place, but I still had to go inside.I said to Railo.\u201cI\u2019ll be back, wait here.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah yes.\u201dShe nodded her head gracefully.Seeing Asher\u2019s strength, it felt like her tone had become a little more polite.I jumped straight down the pit.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was a scale I had never guessed.It was also very artificial.The walls and passages were cut straight like an underground lair of a secret organization, and the glowstones on the walls emitted faint light as if their power was almost exhausted.What the hell is this place?No matter how one looked at it, it\u2019s not an ordinary dungeon.No, was this even a dungeon?Feeling the growing sense of alienation growing in my heart, I moved along the aisle ahead.The aisle was very long. It was also twisted here and there and sometimes divided into several parts.After moving for such a long time, we could reach a certain communal space.\u2026Altar?That was the first thought that came to my mind when I first saw it.A structure made of red stone placed in the middle of a large space.The walls, ceiling, and floor around it were illuminated with magic circles and bizarre characters.I had no choice but to pay attention to such trivial things.It was because \u2018something\u2019 was sitting in the magic circle in the middle of that strange structure.Wearing an old robe, something that looked like a human at first glance.The moment I found it, an ominous feeling of unknown origin soared instinctively, and a number that made me doubt my eyes was reflected in my field of vision.\u3010Lv.\u00a0 97]\u2026What the hell was that, the fuck.I couldn\u2019t help but understood that they were in a very shitty situation right now.This place was not a dungeon where Tair found a mystery.It was the moment she was about to tell Asher, who was holding the hilt of the sword with a nervous expression on her side, to escape\u2026Flash!Violet rays flashed.Asher, who was directly hit by the beam, was blown backwards before she had time to react.\u201c\u2026!\u201dI hurriedly turned my head.Asher was pinned against the wall and could not move. I thought she was dead, but she thankfully just fainted.I slowly looked forward again at the sound of laughter.\u201cKheuh\u2026 hehe, heuhhahaha\u2026!\u201dThe grotesque laughter that flowed from the monster in the robe reverberated through the space.\u201cIt\u2019s here, It\u2019s finally here! After all, fate didn\u2019t forsake me!\u201dAs he got up from his seat, the robe he was wearing crumbled and flew away.And the exposed body of the guy was just bizarre.The skin was black like ink, the veins clearly rising above it were pure white, and the eyes were shining brightly with blood.Peeing!Immediately, I took out the bow I was carrying on my back, took aim and shot the arrow drenched in my blood.However, the arrow was blocked by the shield that wrapped around the robed monster and only bounced helplessly.Feeling very disappointed, I lowered my bow and opened my mouth.\u201c\u2026What are you?\u201dThe monster who had been laughing for a long time stopped laughing and said.\u201cEnpyrus Deima, the wizard who dreams of eternity.\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s a name I\u2019ve never heard of.\u201d\u201cOh, so much time has probably passed since my name has already been forgotten.\u201dHis level was 97. He only had a one level difference compared to the Overlord, Rashtain.My life was in danger.Asher was knocked out, and my instant kill ability couldn\u2019t reach him.I kept my composure and stared at him with sunken eyes.\u201cIs the reason you attacked us because we invaded your territory?\u201d\u201cInvasion? Hahaha! Quite the opposite! Do you know how long I\u2019ve been waiting for someone to come here?! I couldn\u2019t step out of this small magic circle, barely maintaining my dead body!\u201dHe said incomprehensible words.However, I could tell from his words just now that he was an ancient mage, and that he had been imprisoned here for a very long time.And he was thrilled by my presence here.Fu-wook!\u201c\u2026?!\u201dThe light flashed again, and my stomach felt hot.I knelt down as I felt my body drain from the intense pain that followed.\u201cKuk\u2026\u201dI looked down at my side, which had been completely ripped open and blood was pouring out of it.I didn\u2019t even have time to activate the floating veil because I couldn\u2019t react to the attack at all.At that moment, I heard the monster\u2019s voice.\u201cWhat are you? Why can\u2019t you block an attack like this when your soul level is so high?\u201dGulleong!The blood that flowed from me floated in the air and moved to him.Soon, a voice full of joy filled the cavity.\u201cWell, it\u2019s okay. The blood of someone as high as you can bring my body back to life! I can get out of this damn place and finally go out into the world again! Hehe! Hehahahaha!\u201dHearing a buzzing sound in my ears, I raised my head.He sucked up all the blood he had taken from me and began to greedily absorb it.The more he did, the more his body repeated expansion and contraction as if it were revitalized, and a huge energy swirled around him.I was dizzy from the pain, but I couldn\u2019t help but burst out laughing at the sight.After drinking all of my blood, the guy with a face full of elation tilted his head.\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201dI barely opened my mouth and squeezed out my voice.\u201cThank you for being so considerate\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cDie.\u201dPoof.The monster\u2019s body collapsed, and the energy that filled the cavity disappeared at once.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Super regeneration was activated, and the wound was being regenerated.However, it felt like the recovery was slow. It could be because the injury was serious or the magic that attacked me slowed it down.I soon recovered from my injuries and rose from where I was sitting.I felt as if my body was drained of strength.Of all the risks I\u2019d been through, this time was the most dizzying.If I had been hit in the head rather than the side, I would have died. No matter how effective super-regeneration was, it wouldn\u2019t be able to restore even the head.The light of the magic circle that was illuminating the space also disappeared when the monster died.I stared at the dead man and looked back at Asher with a sigh.Asher was sprawled against the wall and lay motionless.I went over to her, picking up her messy clothes.\u201cHey.\u201dI didn\u2019t know if her injury was serious or how should I wake her up, so I patted her cheek first.As her eyelids fluttered, Asher slowly opened her eyes.I asked her as she blankly blinked her eyes in relief.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes. How much am I\u2026 that monster?\u201d\u201cDead.\u201dAsher, who was confused, let out a small sigh, as if she understood the situation, and then became devastated.To be honest, it was fortunate that she was only hit once and flew away and then retired from battle. I could see the level, but she couldn\u2019t. So, this must be another blow to her self-esteem.\u201cSorry. Nothing else\u2026\u201d\u201cHe was as strong as the overlord.\u201dAt that, Asher widened her eyes and looked at me.I took a Scarlet potion out of my arms.The attack hit her right below, so she was fortunately safe.Asher shook her head, planted her sword on the floor, and stumbled to her feet.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cJust drink a little if you don\u2019t want it to be poured on your wounds.\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s really fine.\u201dHow stubborn\u2026She kept repeating that it was okay even if I was practically forcing it to her, so I pretended to bring it to her mouth.Startled, Asher stepped back, tripped over her foot, and fell again.I looked down at her as she fell, a little startled by her furious reaction.\u201cYour condition is not normal, after all.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAsher\u2019s eyes looked this way, and I felt a faint mix of embarrassment and resentment from her gaze.Who kept insisting on rejecting the potion here?\u201cIt\u2019s an order, so drink.\u201dEventually, Asher took the Scarlet potion and drank it.She was an irreplaceable talent for me. How could even a hundred bottles of this potion be wasted?If there was any trouble, I had to fix it right away, so that there was no problem.By the way\u2026I sighed inwardly and turned my head back to the fallen monster.What the hell was that bastard?Why was there a monster of such a crazy level in this forest?No matter how many strong mages were there in the golden age of ancient magic, at level 97, they would have been one of the strongest on the continent.He said he\u2019s Enpyrus Deima.It was a name I didn\u2019t know about the ancient NPCs because the game rarely mentioned them.The ancient era almost had no records other than the ruins buried all over the continent.I moved and went up to the altar.Looking around the dead man, there was something like a book.I picked it up and paused.This was because the book crumbled at the slightest touch.\u00a0How old was this?I had no choice but to crouch down in front of the book and flip through the front pages as carefully as I could.\u201c\u2026\u201dWhat?I stared blankly at the letters written in the book.So\u2026 these were ancient characters, but I could interpret them perfectly.Earlier, I paid little attention because all I could think of was to survive, but I actually had a natural conversation with the monster in an ancient language.Being able to understand and speak ancient language, I easily concluded.Because I had experienced this sensation once before.It was like that when I first possessed this body.The first time I entered this game, I communicated with the prisoner in the common language of the continent with no problems.I didn\u2019t know the details, but I wondered if something similar to that time had happened.Is the conversation a trigger?It made sense if the trigger was having a direct conversation with someone in a language I didn\u2019t know.I planned to check it out later, but for now, I turned my attention back to the contents of the book.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even if aging is delayed by magic or other powers, even if the living body is discarded and the dead body is resurrected, the end will eventually come. I wanted to overcome that limitation. I wanted to shed my mortal shell and become an eternal being.What followed word by word was about magic research.Even after reading it, I didn\u2019t understand it, so I skipped it.\u2013 But in the end, I couldn\u2019t fulfil my dream even with so many efforts.\u2013 The end has come to the body that has lived for thousands of years. Originally, I could have lived longer, but the burden accumulated through various studies came to a limit.\u2013 If I use the necromancer to resurrect as the body of the dead, I can prolong your existence. However, if that happens, I can never return to being a living being again, and I will have to live the rest of my life in the body of the dead. It\u2019s denying me everything.\u2013 I met my end here, where I have been with my whole life. I don\u2019t want to leave a legacy. All that remains is this diary.\u2013 Loneliness. I never imagined that the day would come when I would feel this feeling. If I had known it would be like this, it wouldn\u2019t have been so bad to raise a few decent guys as disciples.Up to this point, it seemed like an ordinary life of a mage crazy about magic.But why did he stay alive like this without dying?The answer to that came immediately after.\u2013 At the moment of death, I have everything down, and then a new realization came.\u2013 I realized how to increase the lifespan of this body, but it was useless. For me, the body of a high-ranking being was needed as a sacrifice.\u00a0Far from looking for a sacrifice, his now dying body could only survive within the barely opened barrier.\u00a0 What a cruel fate.\u2013 The way to be reborn as an eternal being, a flawless existence, was dimly visible. It can\u2019t end like this. Even if I can\u2019t move because I\u2019m confined to this place, I will wait for someone who will find this place someday. Even if eternity of time passes, I will not disappear and will wait\u2026Sacrifice\u2026 was that why he went wild with joy when he saw me?Perhaps because of the [Soul of the King], I seemed to be a high-ranking being in his eyes.What followed that was increasingly messy.I could see in the writing that his mind was getting more and more broken, perhaps because I was confined alone for so long.After skimming through the contents, I closed the book.Nothing special.I was just dumbfounded.So this place wasn\u2019t the place written on the map, and this guy named Enpyrus wasn\u2019t the creator of the dungeon.I accidentally, unluckily, found the place where the crazy ancient mage was sealed instead of the dungeon I was originally looking for.\u2026What kind of crazy coincidence is this?Did I receive any penalty for possessing this body?If I could see the stat window, wouldn\u2019t the luck stat displayed be -99?It was like when I was looking for super regeneration, when I was looking for the floating veil, just whenever I tried to find a mystery, it felt like a crisis always happened.Once again, I cursed inwardly and got up from my seat.In his diary, he wrote he would not leave any legacy, so it didn\u2019t seem like there would be any relics to look for.Still, I went out of the aisle just in case, went around and looked around, but couldn\u2019t find anything.I just found out that this underground space is absurdly large, no less than my castle. Could a space this huge be buried entirely in this forest?Feeling empty, I said to Asher.\u201cLet\u2019s go out.\u201d***When we returned aboveground, I couldn\u2019t see Railo.Where did she go?I waited, wondering if she had gone to see something, but after a while she did not come back.If she was attacked by something, there should be a sign of battle here, but there wasn\u2019t anything like that.Asher looked around and said.\u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be any sign that she\u2019s still here.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI pondered and concluded.She must have run away.It was a situation that could only be explained that way.When she saw Asher\u2019s skills, it intimidated her, so she decided to just leave.Because she witnessed where the dungeon was, she could have thought we might try to kill and silence her.The way back is not complicated, so it doesn\u2019t matter\u2026I sighed inwardly.So where the hell was the dungeon that Tair found?It was a pity to just go back like this, so I looked for more.We continued moving in the direction the branch pointed.After quite a while, I found another luminous tree.The luminous tree grew close to a fairly large rock, and the surrounding area was full of bushes.I went closer and looked.Examining the overgrown bush revealed a small passageway between the rock and the ground.\u201c\u2026\u201dI stared at the passageway, then turned my head.Asher came closer too, staring down the passageway, and then our eyes met.Fuck\u2026A string of curses rose in my throat before it finally subsided.So, because I chose that first luminous tree, we went through all that hard work looking for something that wasn\u2019t there.Kwaaang!I had Asher widen the passage and went inside.When a wide space appeared after passing through a narrow corridor, I saw wooden giants standing in the center like wooden dolls.\u3010Lv.\u00a0 48]Looking at the shabby level above their heads, I clicked my tongue slightly.Yes, it\u2019s right here. The dungeon that Tair discovered.Soon, blue light lit up in their eyes, and letters in ancient languages appeared on the wall next to them.\u2013 Adventurer, face the ordeal.\u2013 Overcome the trials and claim my legacy hidden in this dungeon.\u2013 If you destroy the magic stones on each edge to avoid the guardians, their movement will gradually slow down, and if you destroy them all, it will stop.I looked around the space.As the saying goes, each of the walls at the edge of the space was studded with magic stones. Destroying all the magic stones seems to be the condition for clearing the dungeon.Cooong.Soon, the Guardians began to move and approach us.I told Asher.\u201cAsher.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cDestroy them.\u201dWaa!Asher\u2019s blow swept away all the Guardians.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thank you to transhumanist Sykes and Zxz for the donations! ^^It wasn\u2019t a high-level dungeon, as I thought.After dealing with all the guardians and moving on, a trap came out this time.Magic circles were engraved on the walls of the long, straight passage.\u2013 Salute to those of you who passed the first ordeal.\u2013 Break through the magic arrows raining from all sides and go to the passage on the other side\u2026Kwaaang!Asher\u2019s sword strike destroyed all the magic circles on the wall.After that, traps continued to appear, but we easily passed it.These traps appeared while telling us we had to pass the trials.I didn\u2019t think the one who made these traps expected us to move forward while dealing with everything like this, so I feel a little sorry.Most dungeons were created in ancient times.Because of this, there were many cases where the guardians and traps prepared by the creators were too old and did not work. Just like the dungeon where the floating veil was hidden last time.However, the creator of this dungeon didn\u2019t seem to be a very good mage. The devices were still working properly, at least.Perhaps it was created relatively late in ancient times, or it was not an ancient dungeon at all.Eventually, a huge stone gate appeared, as if advertising that this was the final stage.Is it the end?I found nothing like a hidden space on my way here.So the mystery I was looking for must be in there.I wondered if this was the end of an ordeal that was really not an ordeal. Then a letter glowed on the floor right in front of the door.\u2013 The last ordeal is an ordeal to test your luck.\u2013 Armed Forces, Wisdom, Companions, Trust, and Powerful Weapons. Even if you have all of those things the most important thing is luck.\u2013 Pick up the marble placed right in front of the door and insert it into one of the two holes in the door.\u2013 If you choose the correct answer, the door will open. If you choose the wrong answer, the door will not open forever.\u00a0Opportunity comes only once.Asher couldn\u2019t read the ancient language, so she just stared blankly at it, not understanding the meaning.After reading all the explanations, I moved on.I picked up the orb from the pedestal in front of the door and walked closer.Clap.With little hesitation, I inserted a bead into the hole in the left, and there was no response from the door.The letters shone on the floor again.\u2013 Wrong answer, adventurer.\u2013 Unfortunately, you do not deserve to claim my legacy. Throw away your regrets and go back.I scratched my cheek and said to Asher.\u201cAsher, break it.\u201dWaa!The huge stone gate was shattered.It seemed to have been strengthened with magic, but it meant little in front of Asher\u2019s power.After going through all those traps, we finally reached the end of the dungeon.I stood in front of the collapsed door, peeked inside, and spoke to Asher.\u201cWait here.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI left her and went inside.After passing through the narrow passage, what appeared soon was a space resembling a laboratory.In the middle was a luxurious wooden box, like a treasure chest.When I opened it, there was an old book and a letter inside.\u201c\u2026\u201dJudging from the title, the book seemed to be a magic book in which the creator of the dungeon organized his magic, and the letter was also a letter from the creator.After looking at the contents roughly, congratulations on coming this far, and since his own magic is a one-person transmission, he should pass it on to only one person.I closed the letter with a smile.Looking at the devices in the dungeon, one could roughly tell the maker\u2019s magic skills, but the letter was written as if he had left a great magic book of some century.I looked around.There was no passage to go further, so this was the only space where the mystery could be.However, there was no mysterious pattern anywhere in the immediate sight.Could it be that after all this hardship, was it all in vain again?Feeling a little impatient, I took a more thorough look around me.\u201c\u2026Ah.\u201dAnd when I moved the bookshelf in the corner and looked at the wall behind me, I could finally grin.A mysterious pattern engraved on the wall.It was shimmering in a blue light and was exquisitely covered because it was the size of a bookshelf.I reached out my hand without hesitation toward the pattern.Hwaaak!As always, the pattern glowed brightly and was absorbed into my body.I stood there blankly for a moment, then slowly looked around again.\u2026What is this?I felt it.As soon as I absorbed the mystery, I felt it clearly.The sound, the smell, all the stimuli flowing in from around.I clearly recognized the presence of Asher standing outside the room, as if I could see it.As I concentrated more, my senses sharpened and I could even feel insects crawling on the floor.It felt like crossing the threshold of a whole new world.Was this?Was this the sensation that superhumans in this fantasy world usually feel?And it wasn\u2019t just a sensation.My reflexes were also noticeably improved.I picked up a stone from the floor and threw it.The stones flying in a parabolic arc to the other side looked slow, like slugs crawling.In addition, the visual acuity was enhanced, so even while flying, every angular part of the stone could be seen clearly.What a cheat, really.This was a skill I really shouldn\u2019t have missed.After being properly beaten by an ancient mage earlier, I realized it once more.Even if I had defensive abilities, if I couldn\u2019t react to an attack, it\u2019s useless.However, with this level of cognitive ability, he could cope with the speed of most superhumans.I\u2019ll have to adapt quickly.I clenched my fists and closed them, calming the sharpened senses again.I just got it, so I was not used to it yet, but it didn\u2019t seem like it would take long for my body to get used to it.Come to think of it, this mystery had no name.In the game, Tair never gave it a specific name.After thinking about it for a while, I immediately came up with a suitable name.There was the mystery of super-regeneration, and this one roughly had the same feeling.\u2018Super sensory.\u2019With this, I had already obtained three mysteries, including super sensory.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m asking you to do it to an empty space.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dThe reason I made this request out of the blue was because there was something I wanted to check.Asher looked puzzled, but she didn\u2019t ask why and she meekly drew her sword.I spoke again to her, who was about to wield her sword.\u201cDo it with all your might. You can even use any of your special abilities.\u201dAs a member of the White Moon, Asher had a racial trait that enhanced her magical powers.I wanted to see her in full power while using that trait.A little taken aback by my request, Asher hesitated, then she nodded her head and showed off her ability.Saaa.Asher\u2019s body glowed softly, and soon the skin all over her body turned white.It was the first time I had ever seen her use this. Because she hadn\u2019t used it until now.Adjusting her stance, she caught her breath and began swinging her sword.Waa!A sword strike was drawn in the air, producing an unbelievable sound from just her swinging the sword.I maxed out my super sensory and stared at her sword dance.\u2026I could see it.I could see the sword movement, enough for me to react even if that sword was directed at me.My senses had become so good that I could detect even the movements of a level 81 person. And there was even still room for it.It seems like it\u2019s enough to respond to a level 80 to a certain extent.But what if the enemy was stronger than that?I recalled the movements of the warrior I saw on the escort ship or the mad blows I encountered in the hallway during the Lords\u2019 meeting. The ancient mage\u2019s attack that had completely razed my side earlier.The attacks before gaining super sensory were not visible at all, so there\u2019s no way I could guess them even if I recalled them\u2026 but I don\u2019t know. Unless I checked it again myself.Anyway, after confirming the somewhat satisfactory results, I opened my mouth.\u201cStop.\u201dAsher stopped and took her breath lightly.She didn\u2019t even wield it much, but it seemed that she really used her strength with all her might.And for some reason, she was staring at me as if she was expecting something.\u201c\u2026\u201dWhy was she looking at me like that?I tilted my head and realized why.Did she think I ordered her to do that so I can evaluate her skills?Looking at those strangely expectant eyes, that seemed to be the case.I was silent for a moment and then said.\u201cThere is definitely potential. Keep trying.\u201d\u201c\u2026All right.\u201dShe nodded her head with a slightly regretful expression.I felt apologetic because she seemed to expect more, but what advice could I give her with my skills?It was dark at night, but we went straight through the forest without stopping.It exhausted me but I could endure because I had super regeneration. I wanted to sleep as soon as we reached the carriage.It wasn\u2019t until the sun rose in mid-sky that we arrived at the carriage and saw Baros, who was eating alone\u201cYou\u2019re here, my lord.\u201dHe must have been hunted somewhere, seeing as how he was eating a well-groomed rabbit and roasting it.Asher and I joined him and ate on the spot. Then went back to the city.***Back in the city, I stopped by the Adventurer\u2019s Guild again to find out what happened to Railo.I heard from another adventurer that she had returned to the city and that she had rushed off to another city the moment she did.She must have felt terrified.Her situation was kind of funny. Anyway, I just made sure there wasn\u2019t anything wrong with her, so I could put my mind off her.After we stayed for one more day, we immediately left the city.The next destination, as originally planned, was the territory of the First Lord, the Wiseman. It was a bit far this time.From the current location, we planned to go through the Fourth, Third, and Second Lords\u2019 territories in a curved line and traveled the shortest route.After so much time, we arrived at Cubax, one of the large cities on the border of the Third Lord\u2019s territory.I was lost in thought as we waited at the checkpoint at the castle gate and waited for our turn.This is now a fork in the road\u2026I was a little worried.One of the most necessary abilities for me was blood magic. Elrod Forest was the place to get it.Elrod Forest was far to the west of this city of Cubax.Should I continue on to the First Lord\u2019s territory as it is, or should I stop by Elrod Forest?According to the original plan, I was going to put aside getting blood magic and just focus on mysteries.However, after gaining the floating veil and super sensory, I became more confident in my ability to save myself, so I felt a bit of regret just passing the forest like this.After a short thought, I decided it would be better to just go to the First Lord\u2019s territory.No matter how I thought about it, there were too many variables if I went to Elrod Forest.Even though I was sure of my safety, I had to talk to the vampire tribe living there in order to get blood magic. But was that even possible?So, as originally planned, it would be best to put off blood magic and focus on the mysteries.\u201c\u2026?\u201dI was lost in my thoughts, but I looked out the window as there was a commotion outside.There were several wagons passing proudly to the side, ignoring the checkpoints standing in front of the gate.I could see the sight of the passers-by standing in line, hesitating and looking away.One wagon\u2019s luggage compartment was barred with iron bars, making it look like a prison in which young boys and girls were imprisoned.\u2026Slave traders?I rested my chin on my hand and stared at them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The largest and most notorious group under the Third Lord\u2026That\u2019s right, those guys.Information came to mind one by one.A dangerous group whose focus was the sale of slaves, and a whole other plethora of dirty jobs.In the game, was there a side story of assassinating a high-ranking official of the monarchy who attended the secret auction held by them as a VIP?I stared at the slaves behind bars.All of them had dead eyes, and they had no desire to live at all.Of course, slaves also existed in this fantasy world where the caste system was fully alive.I remembered there were countries where slavery was illegal, but that wasn\u2019t the case here in Calderic.It could be illegal in certain Lords\u2019 territories if the Lord wanted to.\u201cHey, you guys! Interrupting the line like this?!\u201dA young man with a disgruntled face got off the carriage that was in front a short distance away from our carriage.An aristocratic man, accompanied by an escort knight, strode toward the slave traders passing by.The atmosphere of the passers-by who were watching the scene subsided quietly.The leader, the long-haired man, saw him approaching and smiled.\u201cAs you can see, we have a lot of commodities with us, so it\u2019s cumbersome to stand in line. Please forgive us.\u201dThen he pointed to the slaves carried behind him. They were called \u2018commodities\u2019.\u201cExcuse me? Are you kidding me? For a reason that doesn\u2019t even make sense\u2026\u201d\u201cSir, may I ask what family you are from?\u201dThe man laughed and said.\u201cFamily, my family? Are you intimidating me right now? My father is the deputy mayor of the city of Volcadion Chail, the First Lord\u2019s territory! The lowly slavers who dare\u2026\u201dThe men who were listening to him laughed.The man was taken aback by the unexpected reaction.\u201cH-how dare you\u2026\u201d\u201cOops, I didn\u2019t know that you\u2019re the deputy mayor\u2019s son and committed disrespect. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cYes, yes. I\u2026\u201d\u201cBut since the young master is from a different territory, I guess you didn\u2019t know who we are.The long-haired man whispered into the man\u2019s ear.Because I had super sensory, I could hear the whisper clearly in my ears.\u201c\u2026Stop being a bother and get out of here, kid. Don\u2019t act as if you are in a position to look down on us. Or shall I just twist all your limbs and pull them out?\u201dAt that, the man turned white and stepped back saying nothing.Long-haired smiled as if he had never said such a thing, bowed his head and went on his way.I laughed out loud as I watched the series of scenes.He\u2019s a funny guy.Valkilov probably had deep connections with several high-ranking officials in the Third Lord\u2019s territory. It wouldn\u2019t be the most notorious organization in this territory for nothing.There\u2019s no need for them to care about a noble from another territory, and was only the deputy mayor\u2019s son.The man watched them leave, then went back to his carriage trembling with a look of humiliation on his face.The guards at the gates, as if familiar with this situation, exchanged a few words and then let their wagons pass right into the city one by one.\u201cIt\u2019s a dirty scene.\u201dAs Asher looked at them with her cold eyes, she spoke.I asked as I withdrew my gaze.\u201cAre the slaves pitiful?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, honestly.\u201d\u201cSo you want to help?\u201d\u201cNo. I know that there\u2019s nothing I can do about it.\u201dIt was as she said.This was a different matter from helping that waiter in the Fifth Lord\u2019s Territory the other day.The slave trade was legal in this world, and they were just merchants who bought and sold slaves within that framework.If one dig deeper, they might find a lot of illegal things, but on the surface, it\u2019s very much legal.Still, what if they pitied the slaves and killed all those men and saved them?What were we going to do with the slaves we saved? Would we take responsibility until the end and lead them to live a normal life?And what about the Valkilovs?Of course, with a Lord\u2019s power, even a single cancerous tissue could be extinguished.Even if it was a group belonging to the Third Lord, it was an act that would never be tolerated in Calderic if they opposed a Lord first.But what could that mean?It\u2019s just momentary self-gratification.Besides that Valkilov, there would still be countless slave guilds and slaves on this continent.Would I kill them every time I ran into them? Freeing the slaves without thinking about the future?It was no different from just a maniac. With no clear standards or beliefs, I just went around doing things as I saw fit.I would help if there was someone in need, but it was difficult to overdo it without crossing that line.My current priority was to collect hidden pieces and increase my chances of surviving.I was not wandering around Calderic to pretend to be an apostle of justice.Still, it\u2019s pitiful.From the eyes of modern people, it was a pitiful scene of human rights violations.I watched the wagons disappeared one by one into the castle gate.\u201c\u2026!\u201dThen my eyes widened.It was because one slave in the last wagon caught my eye.The figure of a young girl with black hair and red eyes.\u2026Vampire?As I boosted my super sensory to enhance my eyesight, I saw fangs protruding from her mouth.Obviously a vampireBlack hair and red eyes were racial characteristics of vampires. Except for mutants, all vampires have black hair and red eyes.I could also hear the men next to her talking.\u201c\u2026But if a vampire appeared, who would bid? It was embarrassing.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s still a rare product. How many aristocrats have perverted tastes?\u201dAs I listened to the conversation, I stared at the girl crouching inside the cage.Until the wagon passed through the gates and was completely out of sight.\u201c\u2026\u201dI leaned back and was in deep thought.I didn\u2019t expect to see it in a place like this because it\u2019s a rare species that was hard to see. It was even a vampire who was captured as a slave.Suddenly, something flashed through my mind.Vampires\u2026 Elrod Forest\u2026Vampires were a rare race, so they had strong racial love.Then, what if I rescued that young vampire and took her to Elrod Forest?I didn\u2019t know if that girl was from the same tribe as the vampires in Elrod Forest, but they\u2019re still the same race.Since I saved their own people and brought them back, at least I should be able to talk to them without being attacked.Yeah, a method like that is workable, right?In an instant, I drew an ideal picture in my head.I thought this was worth doing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What kind of slave did you come to buy?\u201dI told her.\u201cI heard a vampire came in as a slave.\u201d\u201c\u2026Oh, that\u2019s right. She just arrived.\u201dThe woman looked embarrassed, but she continued her words with regret.She said, \u201cBut you can\u2019t buy that child because she\u2019s already scheduled to be sold to someone else. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u2026Scheduled for sale?I knew intuitively that she was lying to me. And also the hidden meaning of her words.Come to think of it, they were talking about the bidding earlier.They were talking about the one that would take place in Domihawk City. A secret auction hosted by Valkilov.The vampire girl was scheduled to be auctioned there.I said again.\u201cHow much should I pay for her so you can sell her to me?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cEven if I paid 200 golds or two platinum coins? Is it still not enough?\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201dThe woman lost her words for a moment, then she spoke hastily.\u201cNow, could you wait for a moment, young master? I\u2019ll bring the manager right away\u2026\u201dAfter saying that, the woman who went inside returned after a while.She returned with two men, one of whom was familiar.It\u2019s him.The long-haired guy I saw at the checkpoint earlier.He greeted me as he approached me with a business-like smile.\u201cOh, hello! Young master. I heard you came to purchase a vampire slave?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cBy the way, as you\u2019ve heard, it\u2019s a product whose buyer was already decided, so we\u2019re having a bit of trouble selling it\u2026\u201dThis guy was definitely trying to see just how much I would pay for the vampire by saying all these useless things.\u201cThree platinum coins.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI have no intention of offering more. Stop messing around and tell me if you want to sell it for this price or not. If not, I\u2019ll go right back.\u201dAs I said that, I took out three platinum coins in front of me.The branch manager standing next to me looked back at me with shaking eyes.The guy who was staring at me immediately replied with a grin.\u201cI understand, young master. As you wish, I will sell it for three platinum coins. Thank you very much for using our Valkilov Slave Shop.\u201dAnd Asher and I went down to the basement of the building following his guidance.In the basement, slaves were locked in bars at intervals, and it was a sight that made me frown.\u201cHere it is.\u201dIn the prison they finally arrived at, young boys, and girls were locked up.Among them was the vampire girl I was looking for.She was wearing iron shackles on her ankles, and her ankles were all scaly, visible with blood scabs.The guy opened the cage with his key and went inside. He approached her who curled up in her corner.\u201cStand up, vampire bitch. Your master is here.The girl slowly raised her head and looked up at me.I could feel a mixture of wariness and hostility toward me in the eyes filled with emptiness.I also looked at her straightforwardly and said.\u201cRemove the shackles.\u201d\u201cYes, yes. I see.\u201dSoon the long-haired man released the shackles from her ankles and threw the girl out of the cage. Asher, who was following me, held the girl.\u201cIf you want, we can give her a bath right away to make her clean.\u201dThe guy said, looking at the girl.The girl who received that look trembled.\u201cNo need, I\u2019ll take her right away.\u201d\u201cYes, I understand. Then, pay the bill\u2026 Ah, thank you.\u201dI immediately handed him three platinum coins.After going back to the ground, I was about to leave right away because I didn\u2019t want to talk any more, but he grabbed me and said.\u201cYoung master, do you know about the secret auction we are hosting in Domihawk City?\u201dI looked back.He grinned and took something out of his pocket.\u201cIt\u2019s an auction where quality slaves of various races come out and occasionally treasures excavated from ruins also appear. If you\u2019re interested, this is\u2026\u201dSaying that, he handed me an invitation in a luxurious envelope.\u201cIf you go to the branch manager in Domihawk City, he will guide you through the auction.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThen I look forward to seeing you again, young master.\u201dYeah, no thanks.I turned around and left the building.I could hear them talking inside with my super sense-enhanced hearing.\u201cJohn, is this really okay? It was an item to be auctioned off\u2026\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter as long as I explained it to my brother well. And there\u2019s another one, anyway.\u201d\u201cBut still\u2026\u201d\u201cIt was a product that could not exceed 100 gold at most, but how much profit would we get selling for several times than that? Looking at him, he looks like a noble from another territory\u2026\u201dI shook my head and headed for the inn with Asher and the girl.Translator: We still have 9 bonus chapters from donations.

I\u2019ll prepare the meal right away.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dBut the conversation continued to be one-way like this.She just looked at me like a frightened herbivore and kept her mouth shut with a hint of restlessness.Being a vampire didn\u2019t mean that one couldn\u2019t use the official language of the continent. Was she like this only to me?\u201cVampire, are you going to keep your mouth shut?\u201dBaros, who was standing behind me, said with an annoyed look.At the pressured voice, the girl shuddered even more.I frowned and turned to Baros. He was bewildered and bowed his head.\u201cSorry.\u201dI asked, turning to Asher on the other side.\u201cWas she like this when you\u2019re cleaning her up?\u201d\u201cYeah, I tried talking to her, but she said nothing\u2026\u201dHow annoying.Even in real life, I was far from getting along well with children, so I wondered what to do in such a situation.First, I had to ask her something, then take her to the Elrod Forest.\u201cAre you possibly from the vampire tribe living in Elrod Forest?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe girl didn\u2019t even respond to that.She just didn\u2019t seem to understand what I was saying.If she was from the tribe living at Elrod Forest, there would have been a response\u2026 Then, was she a vampire who lived in another place?\u2026That would make things more difficult.A vampire who was not from Elrod Forest. I couldn\u2019t just take her there if she belonged to a different tribe.I was so distracted by the thought of going to Elrod Forest that I forgot about that possibility.I sighed as I looked at the girl with her mouth shut.\u201cI have no intention of confining you. If you wish, I will take you back to your home.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou should at least answer. Or I can take you to Elrod Forest where the other vampires lived. Just say a word and I can take you there.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dIt was the first reaction that the girl gave me.I wondered if her pupils were shaking, and then she finally opened her mouth.\u201cIn Elrod Forest\u2026 are there other vampires\u2026?\u201dI was right and answered right away.\u201cYes, there is a very peaceful vampire tribe living there.\u201d\u201cEh, where is Elrod Forest?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s far west of this city\u2026 No, it\u2019s not too far away. Do you want to go there?\u201dSay you want to go, please.The girl rolled her eyes from side to side before nodding slightly.I burst into joy and nodded my head.\u201cOkay, then I\u2019ll take you right away.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBut aren\u2019t you hungry? It seems like you couldn\u2019t eat properly. Let\u2019s eat slowly and talk\u2026\u201d\u2026Huh?I did not speak and narrowed my eyes.I felt the girl\u2019s breathing becoming rough.She was more restless than before, twisting her legs like that, and no matter how much I looked at it, she didn\u2019t look like she was in a normal state.\u201cHey, are you okay?\u201dShe shook her head violently, as if trying to regain consciousness.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay\u2026 But\u2026\u201dNo matter how one looked at her, she didn\u2019t look good.I got up and tried to get closer to see the girl\u2019s condition.Then she reacted violently and distanced herself from me. I was also confused and stopped.\u201cOh, don\u2019t come.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t stand it anymore, the sweet smell\u2026 Don\u2019t come closer\u2026\u201dNow watching her shake her head, shedding tears, I remembered something.That\u2019s right, young vampires\u2026Vampires were basically a race that considered blood as a staple food. That\u2019s an innate instinct for vampires.An adult could suppress that instinct, but I remembered that there was a setting that it was difficult for a young vampire to do the same. Instinct exploded and dominated periodically.If I remembered correctly, adults gave their blood to the young vampires to satisfy their needs.\u201cDo you want to drink my blood?\u201dI rolled up my sleeves and reached out to the girl.\u201cDrink it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, you can drink. Come here.\u201dI said it in the most mature tone possible.The girl\u2019s expression gradually loosened as if possessed by something, then slowly approached me.Waa!A tingling and rising pain in the arm.The girl grabbed my forearm, pierced her fangs, and sucked blood.Baros and Asher, who were next to us, watched the scene with bewildered eyes.\u201cNo, that\u2019s\u2026 not Lord Ron\u2019s blood, vampire\u2014\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine, just leave it alone.\u201dBaros, who was about to pull up his sleeves, stopped and sat down on a chair as if his strength had just left him.For a moment, we could hear only the sound of a girl sucking blood in the room.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The wounds quickly regenerated and disappeared without a trace.After that, I could have a normal conversation with the girl as if her boundaries had been lifted.The girl\u2019s name was Rudica.She was a vampire from a place far north of Calderic, not from Elrod Forest.The reason she ended up being a slave was like this.\u201cThere was a fight between the tribes. The bad tribe killed our tribe and took over our homes.\u201dBecause she was young, her vocabulary was poor, but I could understand it enough.So, there was a war between the vampire tribes living in the mountains, and the tribe she belonged to was defeated and pushed out.And those who barely survived scattered and left the mountain range, and Rudica\u2019s group was said to have wandered around in search of another home and encountered slave traders.\u201cHumans said adult are annoying and killed them all. My mom and dad too. And they caught me and my sister.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe humans they encountered were probably the slave hunters of Valkilov.They probably thought they couldn\u2019t control adult vampires because they use blood magic, so they must have killed all of them.Vampires, elves, beastmen, etc., regardless of race, finding and capturing a few tribes living in nature, away from the world, was the best way to get slaves.It\u2019s nothing new, but it\u2019s an annoying story just listening to it.\u2026But wait, a sister?That meant she wasn\u2019t alone and had a sister.Rudica\u2019s words continued.\u201cMy sister was caught trying to protect me, and I was hiding and then caught.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d\u201cHey, humans keep saying something about an auction, and they said they moved my sister there first. My sister is probably at an auction.\u201dRudica said in an urgent tone.From what she was saying, she didn\u2019t even understand what an auction was.I became apprehensive inside as I looked into her earnest eyes.Is she asking for help\u2026?Rudica continued to say, crying.\u201cC-can\u2019t we get help from other vampires from the place called Elrod Forest? I have to save my sister. She was trying to save me\u2026\u201dNow that I see it, this was the reason she reacted when she heard that there was another vampire tribe in Elrod Forest. It was, of course, an absurd idea.I was silent for a moment, then nodded.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll save your sister too.\u201dRudica\u2019s face brightened at that.\u201cThank you! Thank you so much\u2026\u201d\u2026I said nothing, but the situation seemed to be troublesome.However, her sister was still imprisoned, so I couldn\u2019t take her alone to Elrod Forest.Let\u2019s go to the city of Domihawk for now.I had an invitation to the auction.First, I went to the city of Domihawk to learn more about the auction, and then decide what to do next.***After staying in the city for a day, we headed straight for the city of Domihawk.It wasn\u2019t far from Cubax, so it didn\u2019t take long by carriage.Whoops.While on the move, Rudica continued to eat with my blood.It\u2019s not that vampires couldn\u2019t eat ordinary food, but she insisted on only my blood because of the taste.I ate my meal with one hand, with Rudica hanging from one arm.Baros said, looking at her with distasteful eyes.\u201cStop being rude to Lord Ron, vampire, and eat my blood. Do you know who the person you\u2019re drinking blood from is?\u201dI said it\u2019s fine, but he\u2019s still doing that tenaciously.Rudica, who opened her mouth, looked at Baros, and shook her head.\u201cI don\u2019t like it\u2026 it smells bad.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dAt those words, Baros gave a slightly shocked expression.Vampires had blood that suited their taste and blood that didn\u2019t.Apparently, elf blood didn\u2019t suit her taste. I guessed she liked human blood more.\u2026Human.A thought suddenly came to mind.Come to think of it, I naturally thought that the race of this body was human, but was that truly the case?Although Asher did not differ from a human on the outside, she was still not a human, but someone belonging to the White Moon tribe.There were many other races similar to humans in this world. Couldn\u2019t I be one of those races too?It doesn\u2019t seem like this body has any special abilities, though\u2026So, it\u2019s probably true that he\u2019s just a human.I brushed away all my bitter thoughts and focused on eating again.After eating, we got back on the carriage and set off.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I strengthened my senses and narrowed my eyes.A battle?The sound of metal scraping, the sound of flesh being ripped, and the sound screaming.Clearly, it sounded like a group fight was taking place.It\u2019s the same road we\u2019re taking.I wondered if thieves had attacked another passerby.The distance was getting closer, and therefore the noise was also getting closer.By the time the situation came into view, the battle was over, and there was no more noise.\u201c\u2026\u201dI hardened my expression as I watched the scene unfolding in front of the carriage.It was something very familiar.A wagon carrying slaves, the members of Valkilov\u2019s gang and a long-haired man in the middle.For a moment I wondered why they were here, but then I understood.It seemed our route and time of travel coincidentally overlapped with those who were transporting slaves to be auctioned off at Domihawk.I saw the figures of beastmen scattered around them, their blood sprinkled around.The men of Valkilov had not yet pulled their swords, and were staring at the carriage over here.I got off the stopped wagon with Asher and showed my face to them.\u201c\u2026Hmm?\u201dThe long-haired guy looked at my face and spoke with a wide smile.\u201cAh, young master. How did we meet again in a place like this? Were you on the way to the Domihawk?\u201dWithout answering his question, I glanced at the beastmen scattered around.Half of them were already dead, and the rest were panting and staring at Valkilov\u2019s gang members.I turned my gaze back to him.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201dHe replied in a nonchalant tone.\u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing. Just being attacked by these wild beasts.\u201d\u201cAttacked?\u201d\u201cThese cubs planned to attack us to rescue their people imprisoned there. It\u2019s not a big deal. It happens often.\u201dWhen he said that, there were young prisoners locked in iron bars where he pointed with his chin.They had been locked up in the basement of the slave trader with Rudica before.The men giggled and grabbed the fallen prisoners one by one and dragged them.\u201cThey attacked us without knowing what they should and shouldn\u2019t do, so they should pay the price? The dead are dead, and we will sell the living into slavery.\u201dAt the long-haired man\u2019s sarcastic words, a female beastman gritted her teeth and shouted.\u201cYou cruel human beings! Aren\u2019t you the ones who invaded our home first, killed the tribe members who went out of the forest and kidnapped our children?\u201dIt was a desperate cry, as if blood was boiling from her throat.I looked at her like that, then looked back at her long hair.The long-haired man walked towards her with a grin and stomped on her head and slammed it to the floor.\u201cYou\u2019re saying something funny. Isn\u2019t that the way nature is supposed to be? The strong tramples the weak, just like this.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026!\u201d\u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry for showing you such a filthy side, young master. Don\u2019t worry and go on your way. It seems like it will take a while for us to clean up.\u201dAs he said that, he giggled and rubbed the female beastman\u2019s trampled head.One young prisoner, who was locked in a cage, cried.\u201cOh, my sister! My sister\u2026!\u201d\u201cOh, was this your older sister? It\u2019s good that the sisters will be sold as a pair. Those nobles with various tastes will be equally pleased with you two.\u201dThe sound of the devil\u2019s laughter echoed in my ears.I looked at the sights and then looked up at the sky once.I recalled the thoughts I had when I found the slaves at the checkpoint.It\u2019s just a momentary self-satisfaction.Then I wondered, what if a person could only live doing what\u2019s comfortable for them? Would that still be a person?Sometimes, if one didn\u2019t act as their emotions lead them, were they really a person?This has crossed the line of my patience.I lowered my head again and said to the long-haired man.\u201cHow about letting them go?\u201dThe long-haired man turned his head in this direction.\u201cLet go\u2026 What do you mean by that? Oh, are you saying that you\u2019re going to buy them right here?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dI said again.\u201cI don\u2019t have any gold coins to give you. I\u2019m telling you to just leave them alone.\u201dSilence descended upon my words.All the members of Valkilov, who were dragging the prisoners, stopped their movements and looked at me.The long-haired man wiggled his eyebrows and opened her mouth.\u201cNow what is that\u2026.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you?\u201dI nodded.\u201cSo that\u2019s it.\u201dThen he turned to Asher.\u201cAsher.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dMy voice echoed coldly on the quiet road.\u201cKill them all.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We\u2026\u201dI cut whatever he\u2019s saying and pointed to him.\u201cLet him live for a while. I have something to ask him.\u201dIt was the moment that the guy frowned.Asher\u2019s sword was pulled out, and a blue flash of light flashed through the darkness.And then blood started gushing out.That was the end.The bodies of the men who had lost their heads were scattered on the floor one by one. The road was stained with blood, and dozens of corpses were created in the blink of an eye.If this was before, I probably wouldn\u2019t be able to see anything, but now I can see clearly thanks to my super sensory.Asher slashed her sword at the sides of the long-haired man and cut his arm with a single blow.\u201c\u2026\u201cHe grabbed the cut edge of his arm and let out a scream of pain.Kneeling down on the floor, he groaned, then looked around urgently. Seeing the annihilated subordinates, his pupils shook like an earthquake.\u201cHey, this is\u2026 what the hell is this\u2026.\u201dHe didn\u2019t even properly see Asher wielding her sword.Even if the level was close to 60, there was a far-off difference from Asher, who was over level 80.I plodded.I looked down at the trembling man and opened my mouth.\u201cAre there vampires at the auction in the city of Domihawk?\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201d\u201cOne of the vampire sisters you captured, the older sister.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, that\u2019s right. There is one.\u201dHe became polite in an instant and nodded his head as if half insane.\u201cPlease spare me, young master. I\u2019ll tell you everything you want\u2026\u201d\u201cWhere and when is the auction held?\u201d\u201cAh, exactly fifteen days from now, the venue will open in the basement of a man named Horton on the outskirts of the city. From sunset to midnight, you just need to bring an invitation.\u201dIs it the basement of the mansion?\u201cWho takes part in the auction?\u201d\u201cUsually, nobles from nearby cities take part\u2026 and some officials from the monarchy also attend.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s an auction only for nobles. Can anyone openly take part?\u201d\u201cNo, of course not. Everyone wears a mask and attends the auction.\u201d\u201cCan only one person participate per invitation?\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7No. One person per invitation could take part in the auction as the attendee\u2019s escort.\u201dI nodded. All I needed to ask was this.The guy got impatient and continued talking gibberish.\u201cY-young master, I will take you to the auction house of the Domihawk. These guys are like consumables that you use and throw away anyway, so I have no problem with you killing them. With me, you take part in the auction as a VIP\u2026\u201dI looked down at him without a word.His face was stained with despair, as if he had read the future in my eyes that would soon happen.\u201cIf you kill me, you\u2019ll be in trouble too! I\u2019m a Valkilov executive! All the high-ranking officials of the monarchy have business with our group! And my brother is the head of Valkilov\u2026!\u201dI shook my head and said softly.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that if you are weak, you will be trampled?\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201d.\u201cAs you said, it\u2019s just the law of nature, so accept it.\u201dAnd I turned around.I heard a desperate cry behind my back.\u201cY-you bastard!\u201dHe picked up the sword that had fallen on the floor, turned and ran towards me.Asher flew past me.Fwish!A shattering sound rang out, followed by the sound of something falling to the floor.Even if Asher didn\u2019t move, I could still stop him with the floating veil.Asher brushed off the blood on her sword, then came closer and bowed her head.I felt a little strange and looked around. Corpses strewn with blood.I had seen people die a lot since I fell into this world.But this time, I could say that it was different since it was a massacre that I had committed myself.Of course, the first murder in his life was when he killed the warrior, but he didn\u2019t feel much at the time.To be honest, it felt more like killing a monster than a human being, and I didn\u2019t feel like I had killed someone because he died in an instant.And all the thieves he encountered while wandering around Calderic were killed by Baros himself before I could even step out.This time, there was no feeling at all.But it wasn\u2019t just the effect of the [Soul of the King].What made me feel strange right now was not because of shock or guilt, but because, on the contrary, my mind was too calm. Even if these people were trash, they were still humans.I didn\u2019t think deeply. I guess it\u2019s just because I already got used to it. Or maybe it\u2019s just how I was originally.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dThe fallen beastmen stumbled up one by one.They looked at the annihilated Valkilov with bewildered eyes. Then, soon, their eyes focused on this direction.\u201c\u2026Did you help us, human?\u201dThe female beastman who had just been trampled by the long-haired man asked with a voice mixed with vigilance.I nodded and said.\u201cPack up the wagon and leave quickly. Over time, the organization where these people belonged to may try to track you down.\u201d\u201cOh, I see.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I am Kagor, the chieftain of the Hard Rock clan! I will never forget this favor on the honor of my clan!\u201dHard Rock?It was unnecessary to put any special meaning in this encounter, since it was a beastman tribe that was widespread on this continent.\u201cIf we see each other again. Be more careful with slave hunters in the future.\u201d\u201c\u2026I will always remember this grace! Please tell me your name!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Ron.\u201dI turned around and walked to the carriage.Suddenly, I saw Rudica, who was sticking her head out the window.There was a look of fear on her face, so I stroked her hair once.\u201cYour sister seems to be in the auction house. I\u2019ll save her right away.\u201dAfter tidying up, the beastmen left first.I thought about the future.Auction house\u2026First, I had a rough idea about the auctions held in the city of DomihawkIt would be held a fortnight later, in the mansion\u2019s basement owned by a person named Horton. That mansion must also be a mansion managed by the Valkilov.Should I participate?Two methods came to mind.The first was to just quietly take part in an auction and save only Rudica\u2019s older sister.I had plenty of money anyway, so unless there\u2019s a bidding competition with some vampire-crazed pervert aristocrat, I\u2019d be able to win the bid with ease.The second was to overturn everything in the auction.I could do this with Asher.It didn\u2019t matter how many Valkilov fighters were in the auction house. Because the number of people in the face of a high level difference had no meaning.Or maybe I could go to the mayor of the city of Domihawk and press him down with the power of a Lord to interrupt with Valkilov\u2019s business.An auction was being held in the city he managed. I could tie them all together like that.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201dAfter weighing for a while, I ended up choosing to do it quietly.Also, I was reluctant to do something big like that in other Lord\u2019s territory.Without getting involved in any more annoying things, let\u2019s just get Rudica\u2019s sister and head to the Elrod Forest. That was it.And the ones I just killed\u2026There were no witnesses, but I thought they might follow the tail. Just because there weren\u2019t any witnesses didn\u2019t mean no one could track what happened here.Of course, it wasn\u2019t much of a concern.I just had to deal with them.If they still bothered me, then I could turn the whole Valkilov over.My thoughts were quickly organized.The carriage, which had started again, crossed the road.***After some time, we arrived in the city of Domihawk.There was still some time before they held the auction, so in the meantime, I just looked around the city.And the night of the auction finally came.I left Baros and Rudica at the inn, and Asher and I went out into the street.I see.There were already several people with masks in their hands circling the streets.Judging by the fact that people who looked like escorts were also attached to them, they were nobles who came to the city to participate in the auction.I looked around them and walked through the streets where the night market was open.There was a street vendor selling masks just in time, so I stopped and looked at the masks hanging from the stalls.There were various animal masks, and there were also masks that were ridiculous like the ones worn by clowns.I chose roughly one of them, a fox animal mask.\u201cYou choose one too.\u201dI spoke to Asher, and she glanced at the masks.Considering her personality, I thought she would pick just one, but she was choosing more carefully than I thought.\u201cI\u2019ll pick this.\u201dSoon, Asher picked up one mask. It was a rabbit mask with elongated ears.She picked something that didn\u2019t suit her, so I stared at it, and she said as if reading my mind.\u201cIf it stands out too much, I\u2019ll pick another one.\u201d\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dAfter picking the masks, we headed straight for our destination.Horton\u2019s mansion was on the outskirts of the city, and the location had already been determined.After walking down the street, we fell into an alleyway and came out on a narrow road again.The surrounding people vanished, and the mansion began to slowly appear in the distance.Although the size of the mansion was not very large, it didn\u2019t matter since the auction was held underground, anyway.Near the entrance to the mansion, masked men were entering the mansion one by one.\u201cNow put on your mask.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAsher and I put on masks and snuggled between them and entered the mansion.An old elf stood at the entrance of the mansion, which passed through a short garden.Since he was examining the invitations of the people ahead of me, I also took mine out of my arms.My turn came, and I showed the invitation to the old man.He glanced over at Asher and I, then accepted the invitation and bowed his head.\u201cI hope you have a great night. Just go inside and go down the stairs right in front of you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, on the contrary, the surrounding atmosphere was gloomy and sharp.Suha, who had just finished reporting, stood in the front, swallowing saliva and waiting for the other to respond.\u201cSo\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAn unknown young noble bought a vampire for a huge sum in Cubax. Is this the only thing you\u2019ve found out?\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7That\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not even sure if he has anything to do with my brother\u2019s death\u2026\u201dThe man\u2019s voice drooped.Suha felt like he wanted to close her eyes tightly. Because he knew it was the man\u2019s habit when he wasn\u2019t in a good mood.Jack, the leader of Valkilov, that was the man\u2019s true identity.Ahead of the organization\u2019s most important event, the auction, Jack was in a terrible mood.His younger brother, John, was attacked and killed while escorting slaves to be auctioned to the city of Domihawk.What made it even worse was that he didn\u2019t know who he should put this anger on.The discovery was too late to track them down. He sent men to Cubax to check the circumstances behind the scenes, but what they found was only the report he just heard.\u201cUhhh\u2026.\u201dJack let out a shaky breath.It had been a long time since he had such a hard time suppressing his anger.John robbed money from time to time, touched slaves recklessly, and was hateful in many ways, but he was still the only blood relative Jack had in this world.They had been together from the days when they were rolling on the street until they formed the Valkirov and raised them to become the number one organization in the Third Lord\u2019s territory.He closed his eyes for a moment, suppressing the rising anger and emptiness again.Soon, it was time for the auction to start. He would start a more detailed investigation after this.Knock.\u201cCome in.\u201dThe knock rang, and an old elf cautiously opened the door and entered the room.He was a member of the cadre in charge of those attending the auction.Jack slowly opened his eyes and asked.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cSomeone whose identity was unknown attended the auction.\u201dThe attendees did wear masks, but that\u2019s just to cover each other\u2019s faces.The organizer, Valkilov, was naturally aware of the identities of the attendees. They were the ones who gave the invitations in the first place, and most of the time, the attendees were mostly only those who regularly attended the auction.Of course, sometimes there were attendees without information, and in that case, they paid a little more attention to them.Normally, it was a report that he would pass on lightly, but Jack turned his attention to Suha, who had posted the report.\u201cYou said John handed the invitation to the guy who bought the vampire.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cThe escort knight attached to the young human man was said to be a woman. What do they look like?\u201d\u201cThe man had black hair, and the escort knight had white hair.\u201dJack turned his gaze back to the old man.The old man nodded his head.\u201cYes, it\u2019s the same. It was a human male with black hair and a human female with white hair.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s them.\u201dThose who bought a vampire in Cubax, one that was about to be auctioned off.Jack was silent for a moment, then slowly got up.It was not known whether they had anything to do with his brother\u2019s death, but that seemed to be the only thing to look forward to right now.***As we went downstairs, the scenery unfolding was quite surprising.Seats and podium. It looks like an auction house just as I had imagined, but it was because the space was bigger than I thought.The inside of the auction house was dimly lit by glowstones embedded in the walls, and quite a few people were already sitting in the seats.At the very back, there were also seats placed on the second floor railing, which at first glance looked like VIP seats.Following the guidance of the person standing at the entrance, I took a seat and sat down with Asher.What\u2019s this?There was something like a numbered picket on the armrest of the chair, so I picked it up and looked at it. It\u2019s probably used when bidding at an auction.I put down the picket and turned my gaze back to the podium.Are the slaves coming from there?The host would introduce the slaves, and the attendees would watch them like a beast in a cage, and if they like it, they bid.Even if I had never experienced a place like this before, it was a scene that I had already drawn roughly.I glanced back at Asher, who just clicked her tongue.She definitely felt uncomfortable seeing all this.By the way, when would it start?More and more people started gathering, and the seats were already more than half full.Some, like me, were sitting quietly waiting for the auction to start, while others were chatting with their companions, and I could hear their conversation through my super sensory.\u201cThis time, there are a lot of high-quality products among the prisoners. They say we should look forward to it.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it? I wish they had a child I like. I made a special leash to hang it on\u2026.\u201dIt was a conversation that was disgusting to hear, so I immediately turned off my mind.After a while, the curtains on the podium were lifted and a man in a suit with a mask appeared on stage with lights.\u201cHello everyone, ladies and gentlemen who took part in the auction!\u201dIt looked like the auction was about to start.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The bid method is to call the bid price with the prepared picket on the chair you are sitting on. Now, this is the first product!\u201dA half-elf woman walked out from the side of the podium, bound. No life at all in her eyes.\u201cThe first prize is a female elf! It\u2019s hard to find an elf with this kind of beauty and red hair like this. Now, let\u2019s start the bidding with 20 gold!\u201dOne of those sitting in the seat immediately lifted the picket and the full-scale auction began.30 gold, 40 gold, 70 gold, and quickly climbed to 100 gold with little fuss. Then there was no more bidding.\u201cIt came up to 100 gold! Does anyone have any more bids?! I\u2019m not saying this for nothing. Elf slaves of this quality are really hard to find anywhere!\u201dThe host continued to push the bid, cut the last count, and shouted as if it were a pity.\u201cCongratulations! Gentleman 56 has won the elf for 100 gold!\u201dAfter that, the auction continued smoothly.A lot of different races came out as slaves. Starting with humans, beasts, elves, and other rare races.The host also tried to explain how they had captured some of the slaves. Because that was also a big part of raising their price.In particular, when a fallen noblewoman from Santea came out, the bids skyrocketed and soared to 500 gold.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201dThe dirty, sticky heat of the auction house seemed to cling to my body.I patiently watched the auction quietly.It was only after they had sold about ten people that the reason for my participation in this auction finally appeared.\u201cThe next product is a vampire!\u201dI opened my eyes a little wide and looked at the person who was being dragged onto the podium.A girl with black hair and red eyes, not only her hands, were restrained like other slaves, but she also had a gag in her mouth. At first glance, her face resembles Rudica.\u201cVampires are called a cursed race, but let me warn you in advance that you don\u2019t have to be afraid! Young vampires cannot use their own blood-handling abilities, unlike adults! The taste\u2026\u201dShe glared at those who sat in the audience seat with hostile eyes. For a moment, our eyes met.It was the time when the host\u2019s explanation continued and I was slowly preparing to lift the picket.\u201cHello there.\u201dSomeone came up to me and sat down next to me.\u201cAre you enjoying the auction?\u201dI turned my head.The figure of a man whose muscles seemed to burst all over his body caught my eye.[Lv. 68]What was impressive was the level above his head.A skilled person who is close to level 70.He spoke to me out of nowhere and immediately revealed his identity.\u201cMy name is Jack, the head of Valkilov.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I have something I want to ask you for a bit.\u201dAs I stared at him, he smiled and continued.\u201cYou bought a young vampire from the city of Cubax. You also received an invitation.\u201d\u201cI did.\u201d\u201cIt was my younger brother who handed you the invitation. He was escorting slaves here to the Domihawk, and some assailants attacked and killed him.\u201d\u201cIs that so? I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Yes, I am also very sorry. That\u2019s why.\u201dHis eyes gleamed like a beast.\u201cThe timing is really complicated, so I\u2019m just asking, but do you know anything about it?\u201dI shook my head.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t know.\u201dHe gazed at me, sighed, and leaned back against the chair.\u201cIf I twist and pull out your limbs one by one, would I get the same answer?\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201d\u201cI grew up with good observation skills, you see. You killed my brother, right?\u201dI got caught.Did they catch up from the place where we killed those trash, or was it because of my participation in this auction?It wasn\u2019t important, really. Because he was already convinced that I had killed his brother.Come to think of it, before he died, he said that his older brother was the chief or something. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d come here and find out like this.And here I am, trying to keep it all quiet.But then it failed.I said with a chuckle.\u201cI killed him.\u201d\u201cWhy did you kill him?\u201d\u201cWell, why do you think?\u201dHe let out another long breath, as if to quench his anger, and said.\u201cLooks like you still don\u2019t know your situation. What do you think I\u2019ll do to you from now on?\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201d\u201cI will take you to the torture chamber. There are a lot of excellent torture technicians in our organization. I guarantee you will feel with the flesh and bones of your body that such pain exists in the world. You\u2019ll beg and beg again. As well as that escort bitch sitting next to you.\u201dSaid the guy, growling.\u201cIf you want me to give you a chance to die comfortably, answer my questions sincerely. Who are you, and why did you kill my brother?\u201d\u201cCan you afford it?\u201dHe laughed at my words.\u201cAfford? Stop such pretentious bluffs, child. There is nothing I can\u2019t handle in the territory of the Third Lord. Are you even the Lord\u2019s hidden child? Or\u2026\u201d\u201cI am the Seventh Lord, Ron.\u201dThe voices stopped abruptly.He looked as if he didn\u2019t understand what he just heard.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7What?\u201d\u201cDo I have to tell you twice?\u201dI rested my chin on my hand on the armrest and turned my gaze back to the podium in front of me.He said indifferently while looking at the auction that had just begun and listening to the rising bid price.\u201cI am Seventh Lord, my name is Ron.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

For a moment, everything seemed to have stopped.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Kuh-hat!\u201dSoon the guy burst out laughing.The guy, who had his head bowed and sobbed and laughed, said with a straight face.\u201cAre you crazy? Are you impersonating a Lord\u2019s name in Calderic?\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re a Lord, I\u2019m the hero of Santea, you crazy bastard. You\u2019ve had a lot more flavor than I thought. Did you say it because you thought that such nonsensical bullshit would really work?\u201dWell, this was the reaction.It wasn\u2019t unexpected, so I didn\u2019t say more.To him, it sounded like nothing but bullshit I said to escape the crisis.Of course that was normal. Why would the Seventh Lord who was supposed to be in Enrock be taking part in such a secret auction in the Third Lord\u2019s territory?\u201cYeah, you seem to have no intention of answering my questions, so don\u2019t regret what will happen next.\u201dSaying that, the guy got up from his seat.Then he strode to the podium, stopped the host, and stood in the middle.\u201cI\u2019m sorry everyone, but we\u2019re going to pause the auction for a while.\u201dThe sudden situation caused a commotion in the seats where the participants were sitting.\u201cThere is a person who participated in the auction by killing the members of our organization and robbing them of invitations. We will deal with the rats first and then proceed with the auction as normal, so we ask for your understanding.\u201dAs for what he was going to do, he didn\u2019t seem to have any intention of waiting patiently until the auction was over.My eyes met the guy standing on the podium.Naturally, the surrounding eyes turned all at once towards me.I heard conversations from the participants. They seemed to also consider this a fun event.Haaa\u2026This was tiring.I had been patient with this disgusting auction until now, and this was what it all came about.I didn\u2019t bother thinking about how to sort this situation out. There was no need for that.There\u2019s no need to question how things ended up at this point, I just had to go with the flow.\u201cI\u2019ll give you one last chance. Will you be captured quietly, or will they sever one or two of your limbs while resisting?\u201dSuddenly, armed men appeared around me and surrounded the place where I was sitting. Were you fighters of Valkilov?All of them were over level 50, and there were some who were over level 60, so it seemed like an elite force.I looked at the guy standing on the podium.Judging from the fact that he was just talking, he acted like he was going to tear everything apart with his hands right away, and yet he didn\u2019t order this elite force to attack right away.It\u2019s probably because he didn\u2019t know exactly how strong my side was, so I guessed he was on his guard for now. It was a very prudent decision.Seeing me still sitting still, he clicked his tongue and gave an order.\u201cDon\u2019t kill them yet. Just enough to leave a few breaths.\u201dThe other participants around them retreated outside, and the combatants gradually narrowed the distance.The hall became quiet for a moment.The heat, which had been filthy and stinky until a while ago, turned into coolness and ugliness in an instant.I smiled lightly.Ironically, this atmosphere, which would soon be filled with corpses and blood, felt more comfortable than an auction of buying and selling people.Humans were animals of adaptation, but had I already adapted to this world to this point? I didn\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good thing or a bad thing.\u201cAsher.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAs soon as I opened my mouth, Asher, who was sitting next to me, got up from her seat. And put her hand on the sword.I spoke softly.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you kill them all.\u201dOpponents were dozens, and all were skilled in the 50s and 60s level.On the other hand, there was only one Asher on my side.But I didn\u2019t care in the slightest. Even before the fight, the outcome was already decided.Until now, she had only encountered monsters that are too out of the ordinary, but Asher was a strong person who belonged to the highest rank in this world.If I hadn\u2019t persuaded her and recruited her as an escort, she would have become a knight in the Black Star Order, the elite power of the Overlord Castle.Even if Valkilov was the best organization in the Third Lord\u2019s territory, the status itself was quite different. It was a wolf among a herd of rabbits.The difference in level in the RaSa worldview was so absolute and absurd.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dOne combatant tried to open his mouth.That was his last word.Aah.A huge beam of light emanating from Asher\u2019s sword split in all directions.Then, their bodies were torn apart in an instant and collapsed.It couldn\u2019t even be called a battle. Valkilov\u2019s fighters were wiped out without being able to resist once.For me, it was a natural result, but for those who watched, it was not.\u201cUhhh!\u201dThe participants, who could not grasp the situation for a moment, started screaming and running away in all directions.While the hall was engulfed in chaos, I stared at the guy on the podium, Jack.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7!\u201dAs I looked at the situation with disinterest in my eyes, the pupil of the man who made eye contact with me shook as if an earthquake had occurred.Then he flew straight away from the podium.Wow\u2026He\u2019s running away like that?Asher immediately ran after him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

For a moment, the two of them exchanged blows.Being level 70, he could hold out a little, but that was the limit. Shortly thereafter, one of his arms was cut off, and he was thrown against the wall and thrown to the ground.\u201cKeuk\u2026!\u201dAsher put down her sword and turned around.It\u2019s all over really quickly.I nodded in admiration for her overwhelming power.The auctioneers, as well as the hosts and members of the organization, had already fled, leaving only the slaves in the podium\u2019s corner.They were looking this way in fear, unable to escape anywhere. There was also Rudica\u2019s older sister.\u201cRelease the restraints.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThere will be more inside, so bring them along and gather them in one place.\u201dI left the slaves to Asher, and she trudged away.Asher\u2019s sword ripped his stomach apart and cut off one of his arms, and the dying man barely raised his head.\u201cYou, what the hell are you\u2026?\u201dI stopped right in front of him.\u201cI told you, the Seventh Lord.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201d\u201cYou still can\u2019t believe it? It no longer matters anyway.\u201d\u201cWhy why\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201dAs if he still couldn\u2019t believe it, he repeated those words with a completely exhausted face.Why the hell was the Seventh Lord here? Why the hell did I kill his younger brother and do this?It was a question that I could understand without him having to say anything else.I looked down at him and said.\u201cJust because.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201d\u201cOf all the garbage in this world, you just accidentally, unluckily, bothered my eyes. That\u2019s all.\u201dIt was really just that.I found a vampire by chance, and happened to see his brother\u2019s evil deeds, so I killed him, and then I took part in the auction and got caught.I didn\u2019t particularly have a grudge against them. Things just happened.Of course, as a result, the auction was over, and the chief would soon die, so it seemed that Valkilov would be finished as of today.The guy who had been glaring at me with eyes with resentment squeezed his last strength and got up as if he was bouncing.His still good hand pulled a dagger from his waist.A cold steel aimed at my neck and stabbed me with a warlike cry, but it was a futile effort.Because his movements seemed too slow and clear for my super sensory.The blade blocked by the floating veil could no longer advance in the air and stopped.The guy opened his eyes and the hand holding the dagger shook, then he stumbled again and collapsed to the floor.I placed my hand on the head of the man, who could no longer move as if he had reached the limit. Then I activated [Instant Kill].That was his last moment.I turned to the slaves, not paying attention to the corpse. Asher had released them from restraint and they were looking at this side.Shortly thereafter, Asher brought out some more slaves from the inside.\u201cIs that all of them?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201dI tilted my head as I looked at them gathered in one place.It seemed that there were fewer people than the number of people in the auction earlier\u2026 Were there people who escaped on their own?\u201cHuman, what are you going to do with us?\u201dThen someone opened her mouth with a ferocious voice.Rudica\u2019s older sister was a vampire. Her eyes still glared at us as if we were the enemies.It was unfair since we saved them, but I understood.Her families died at the hands of humans, and since they had captured here her as a slave, it was natural for her to hate humans.I asked her.\u201cAre you Rudica\u2019s older sister?\u201dShe was startled by my words and widened her eyes.\u201cRu, Rudica? How can I you know my sister\u2026\u201d\u201cI came to rescue you at the request of your sister. So there is no need to be wary.\u201dI outlined it to her. The circumstances from meeting Rudica at Cubax to coming to the auction house here.After hearing the whole story, she looked at me with a look of joy and relief, but she was still half vigilant.\u201c\u2026Are you really here at the request of my younger sister? Really?\u201d\u201cYeah. Or how would I know your sister\u2019s name?\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s in an inn in this city, waiting for you to come. So follow me.\u201dShe hesitated and looked back at Asher and I.As I gave her a wink, Asher grabbed her by the shoulder and pulled her away.So she slowly came to where I was standing.I looked around at the other slaves.I achieved the goal by securing Rudica\u2019s older sister, but what would happen to the rest of these people?Oh, I really hated doing things like this in another territory.I remembered about the Third Lord\u2014the Heavenly Palace.He was as unpredictable as the Overlord, and I did not know how he would react if this event reached his ears.Even in the game, he appeared to be indifferent to everything in the world, while being strangely tenacious over trivial matters.It\u2019s not about who was killed and what damage the Lords care about. Would the Third Lord care about the Valkilov?He could still be dissatisfied with the fact that another Lord had made a riot in his realm.Even the Sixth Lord\u2014the Tyrant, who did not differ from a madman, didn\u2019t act arbitrarily in another Lord\u2019s territory.Of course, this wasn\u2019t a huge problem since I was the one who was first attacked\u2026 Anyway.\u201cYou are now free.\u201dI spoke as if declaring to the slaves, who were looking at me with anxious eyes.Even after that, they just stood there looking at each other with bewildered faces.Even if I suddenly gave them freedom, there were some people who had nothing and had no place to return to.It\u2019s impossible to leave this mess and leave them here.So, I was thinking of doing a minimal clean up first.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thank you to Hillpond for the donation! ^^The mayor of the city of Domihawk, Ballon, was living a normal life.After having a late dinner and enjoying tea time alone on the terrace, he was reading until dawn before going to bed.It was then that an unexpected guest came to the mansion.\u201cNo\u2026 Sir Begos, what are you doing here at dawn?\u201dSeeing the man who had entered the central hall of the mansion being guided by the knights standing on the guard, Ballon blinked.Begos, a high-ranking official of the territory.Ballon was acquainted with him.Because it was the mayor Ballon who tacitly allowed Valkilov\u2019s secret auction to be held in this city, and Begos was the VIP of that auction.Today was the day of the auction.Aside from visiting at dawn like this, Begos\u2019 expression looked somewhat urgent, so Ballon looked at him suspiciously.Begos took a deep breath and said.\u201cI\u2019m sorry that I came to you at such a late hour, but\u2026 something happened at the auction.\u201d\u201cAt the auction, what\u2026\u201d\u201cSome madman massacred the people of the auction house. All the managers died, and so did that Jack. The Valkilov is over.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Yes? Jack? Over? You mean the Valkilov\u2019s chief is dead?\u201dBallon asked in surprise.The demon Jack of the Domihawk, the biggest tycoon in the shadow of the Third Lord\u2019s Territory, was killed out of nowhere.He was resourceful, but also had skills strong enough to back up his reputation.\u201cWho the hell did you say they were murdered by?\u201d\u201cThat, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s not even many people, but only one.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s only one person\u2026 shouldn\u2019t they be someone well known in the territory?\u201d\u201cThen I should have known about them. Anyway, that\u2019s why I came to have a discussion with you in a hurry\u2026 Let\u2019s go inside.\u201dIt was then\u2026\u201cMayor.\u201dOne knight who rushed in said in a trembling voice.Ballon looked at him curiously.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on again?\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s\u2026 the Seventh Lord has come.\u201dFor a moment, Ballon blinked for a few seconds, wondering what kind of bullshit this was, and then asked.\u201cWho\u2019s here?\u201d\u201cThe Seventh Lord has come to visit you.\u201dNow the knight\u2019s words didn\u2019t sound any different to Ballon\u2019s, telling him that everyone in the auction house was dead.So\u2026 the Seventh Lord?\u2026Why?Why did the Seventh Lord suddenly come to visit him?Was it someone impersonating him? It couldn\u2019t be. What kind of madman would come to the mayor of one of cities of Calderic under the guise of a Lord?\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7!\u201dIt was a natural flow of thought, so the knights on guard suddenly came to the mansion and had no choice but to bring the man who called himself the Seventh Lord and the people of various races behind him.Ballon\u2019s eyes widened at the sight of strangers slowly entering one by one.The gaze of the man standing in front of them turned to him.\u201cIs this the house of the mayor of Domihawk?\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Yes! I am Ballon, Mayor of Domihawk.\u201dBallon immediately bowed his back at a right angle, feeling a sense of incomprehensible pressure.No matter how far they were from the Seventh Lord\u2019s territory, they in the Third Lord\u2019s territory knew at least the least information about the Seventh Lord. That he was a human male.So, the man in front of Ballon right now could really be the Seventh Lord.Meanwhile, Begos was astonished to see the man, the Seventh Lord, and Asher standing next to him.W-what\u2026At the auction house, the two were wearing a mask, but he could still recognize them.An unidentified man and woman who annihilated Valkilov\u2019s fighters and turned the auction house into a slaughterhouse.The Seventh Lord turned his head and looked at Begos.Begos lost his mind for a moment, then hurriedly bowed his back.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7It is an honor to see the Seventh Lord! I am Begos, an officer in this territory!\u201dNow he understood the situation.It was truly weird at first. Because just where could such a formidable talent come from?He thought it had something to do with some other big organization, but it turned out that it was a Lord himself.Jack, you crazy bastard, what the hell have you done?It was obviously Valkilov\u2019s side who tried to attack the Seventh Lord first at the auction house, saying that the invitation was stolen.Begos couldn\u2019t understand what the hell was going on and how it had been twisted into such a non-funny situation.The Seventh Lord\u2019s mouth opened again.\u201cMayor, I have come to request you something.\u201d\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Request?Ballon answered, still bowing his head and rolling his eyes dizzily.\u201cYes, please tell me!\u201d\u201cDid you know that Valkilov\u2019s secret auction is being held in this city?\u201dFor a moment, Ballon and Begos had their hearts pounding.\u201cThat, that\u2019s\u2026.\u201d\u201cOf course you knew. I\u2019m not trying to blame you for that. I\u2019m talking about the people behind me now. They were sold as slaves to the auction house, but they didn\u2019t deserve it such treatment.\u201dBegos, who knew the context of the situation, swallowed his saliva.Ballon also remembered the story he had heard from Begos and the other\u2019s reaction and quickly inferred the situation.\u2026Was the Seventh Lord the one who carried out the massacre at the auction house?The Seventh Lord glanced back and spoke.\u201cSo, I want you to take responsibility for their personal affairs. I want you to give money to those who have a place to go back, and I want those who have nowhere to go to find a suitable job.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a very difficult request, but Ballon was puzzled.It was because it felt bizarre that a Lord was taking care of the affairs of slaves.Was this the original inclination of the Seventh Lord, or did it mean something else?He couldn\u2019t guess, but he didn\u2019t dare question it.\u201cLeave it to me. I will thoroughly guarantee their safety.\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s the end of the business. Then I\u2019ll leave.\u201dThen the Seventh Lord immediately turned away, leaving the slaves behind.An escort knight and a vampire followed him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But still.\u201c\u2026I suddenly feel 10 years older.\u201dBegos muttered with a face like he was exhausted just as he said.Ballon nodded and agreed.\u201cWhy the hell did the Seventh Lord come to the city of Domihawk\u2026?\u201d\u201cHow can we guess the thoughts of the great people? Think of it as fortunate that it passed like this safely.\u201dBallon sighed as he looked at the slaves left by the Seventh Lord.\u201cSo, the person in the auction house Sir Begos was talking about is the Seventh Lord, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cSo what about Valkilov now?\u201d\u201cWhat are you asking about something obvious? It\u2019s completely over. If you have any connection with them, cut it off as soon as possible. Huh\u2026 I\u2019ll have to go back to the castle in a hurry, too. What kind of lightning bolt is this?\u201d***The slaves\u2019 personal problems were handled simply and reliably using the mayor.The reason for the massacre at the auction house was that Valkilov attacked first, not because I was going to enforce some kind of justice.We immediately returned to the inn.Rudica was waiting patiently in the inn\u2019s room with Baros.Rudica\u2019s eyes widened when she saw her sister.\u201cSister!\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Rudica!\u201dThe two immediately ran to each other and hugged each other.Maybe she didn\u2019t completely trust me, and she, who was still on the verge of breaking point, burst into tears as soon as she saw her sister and hugged her in her arms.I looked at them and asked Baros.\u201cDid nothing happen?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAfter the sisters\u2019 reunion was over, she thanked me with a face that was completely dispelled by doubts.\u201cThank you so much for helping us.\u201dThe older sister\u2019s name was Rubica.I told the two sisters to sit down. It was so we could talk about the Elrod Forest.Rudica had already heard the story, but her older sister, Rubica, did not know about it yet.Rubica listened to what I was saying while clasping her sister in one of her arms.\u201cElrod\u2026 forest?\u201dAfter listening to all the stories, Rubica, who seemed to have a vigilant personality, showed a slightly uneasy look as expected.\u201cIt\u2019s the home of another tribe, and we don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll welcome us\u2026.\u201dThey were sisters who lost their hometown because they were driven out by their own people from where they originally lived.If I asked them to visit another vampire tribe, the other\u2019s reaction was just normal.There were many reasons vampires had a bad image in this world.Adults could suppress their vampire instincts, but not all adults suppress their desire for blood.It was just like humans. Adults could control their desires better than children, but where in the world were there only such great adults?Especially the Sixth Lord, the Tyrant, he\u2019s the best example of a bad adult vampire.When such people gather to form a tribe, they literally became a swarm of who hunted other races.The tribe that had invaded the land of the two sisters probably also belonged to that kind.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that part.\u201dI said in a confident voice to wash away their anxiety.\u201cThe vampire tribe living in Elrod Forest is a very gentle tribe. Humans like me will be rejected by them, but if they are of the same kind, they will accept it.\u201dOf course, I had never seen them in person.Still, the reason I could be so sure was because I had played the game.When the episodes related to Elrod Forest in the game story progressed, vampires who went to the Elrod Forest for reasons similar to these sisters appeared.The tribe from Elrod Forest embraced all of them and lived peacefully amongst themselves.Except for one \u2018problem\u2019.And by solving that problem, there\u2019s a chance that I would get the blood magic I needed so much.Rubica said nothing as if she was in trouble for a moment, then asked me.\u201cBut you\u2026 no, he\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Ron.\u201d\u201cYes, is Ron friendly with the vampire tribe that lives in the Elrod Forest? Hearing the story, it seems like you know them well.\u201dThese two probably now thought that I was trying to introduce them to the tribe at Elrod Forest out of pure goodwill, but it was the opposite.I was going to use these sisters to connect with the vampires there.I nodded, feeling a bit of a prick in my conscience.\u201cI met a vampire from there. That\u2019s why I know about Elrod Forest.\u201dAnyway, I have to take them to Elrod Forest, so it was important to reassure them first.Rubica, who looked like she in agony again, nodded as if she had decided.\u201cOkay. We\u2019ll go to Elrod Forest as Ron said. Thank you for being so kind to us.\u201d\u201cGood decision.\u201dThe persuasion was over.Now it was time to head to Elrod Forest to get blood magic.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was one place that remained in its natural state since civilization blossomed on this huge fantasy continent.In Calderic alone, there were many large and small cities in the Overlord\u2019s territories and the other nine Lord\u2019s territories. However, there were still lands that remained abandoned on the outskirts.Oh, it\u2019s shaking badly.And that meant that the road to Elrod Forest had not been reclaimed at all, unlike the roads to cities and such.I looked at the other side of the carriage, which was shaking more violently than usual, keeping my expression expressionless.The vampire sisters sitting with Asher, leaned on each other and had fallen asleep.A few days had passed since we started heading from the city of Domihawk to Elrod Forest.It was the same journey as always, but if there was something different, it was that the two vampires were accompanying them.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201dI gazed at the two sleeping sisters.Rubika was obviously trying to act more like an adult as she was an older sister, but looking at them like this, she was just a child sitting side by side with her sister.Asher, who was sitting next to them, was also looking at them with strange eyes, but when our eyes met, she looked away as if hesitating.She probably thought of her dead brother as she looked at the vampire sisters.Then Asher muttered and said;\u201cCan I ask the Lord something I\u2019m curious about?\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7?\u201dMy eyes widened in surprise.Because she had never asked me anything before.\u201cGo ahead.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 No, Sir Ron has been looking for places like ruins until now.\u201dAsher stuttered and asked a question.During the journey, I told them to call me by my first name, not the title of \u2018Lord\u2019.But Asher rarely called me in the first place, so she looked unfamiliar with using my name.But why did she suddenly ask that question?\u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019m curious what your purpose is for doing that.\u201dAh\u2026 that\u2019s it.She is asking that now too.I was continuing a very fruitful journey, finding and absorbing the mysteries, but I didn\u2019t consider Asher\u2019s point of view, so it was natural for her to wonder what the hell I was doing.Besides, the reason she\u2019s following me as an escort right now was because of my promise to make her name known all over the continent.However, what I was doing was not like something a Lord would do, so maybe she was frustrated in her heart right now.I\u2019m going to do a lot of things in the future, that\u2019s what I said to her\u2026But I didn\u2019t mean to say anything like that.Even after completing this journey and returning to my territory, there were still piles of obstacles to overcome.In particular, the Invasion of the Demons, the Hero of Santea, the Succession of the Holy Sword\u2026These events were too big to plan anything right now.Anyway, when the next Lords\u2019 meeting comes, the Overlord will probably trust me enough to order me to do something.Once I found all the mysteries in Calderic, I had to think about the overall situation.I felt sorry for Asher, but I hoped she would wait until then.I thought to myself and said.\u201cI\u2019m looking for something. I know you\u2019re curious, but I can\u2019t tell you what it is yet.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll definitely keep the promise I made to you.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Yes?\u201dAsher blinked, as if not understanding what I said. Then she said, \u201cOh,\u201d and nodded.\u201cI was just curious. I never doubted what Sir Ron said.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201dMy conscience pricked me again because of her undeniable trust.I slowly looked out the window.As the sun was rising in the middle of the sky, the carriage stopped for lunch.The sisters, who had been asleep, also woke up.The menu was meat, soup and bread as usual.Baros finished getting his meal quickly and sat down to eat in a suitable place, while Rudica stopped eating the soup and looked at Rubica.\u201cWhat is it, Rudica? Do you want blood?\u201dRubica immediately noticed her sister\u2019s condition and raised her arms.But Rudica hesitated and just looked to the side where I was sitting.I opened my mouth.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, come here.\u201dThen Rudica looked at her sister once more and approached me as if she had been waiting.Rubica put on a puzzled expression as Rudica clenched my forearm and sucked blood as if it were familiar.\u201cRu, Rudica?\u201dIt was the first Rudica drank my blood after Rubica joined the party. For her, it must have been an embarrassing sight.\u201cWhat are you doing, Rudica? Come and drink your sister\u2019s blood. Don\u2019t do that to our benefactor.\u201dBut Rudica shook her head and continued to focus on drinking my blood.Seeing that, Rubica had a shocked face. It looked just like how Baros had looked the last time.\u201cYou, you. You always said that my blood was the best\u2026\u201d\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Why did I have a feeling that I was the bad guy in this situation?Seeing her crying and muttering, I became embarrassed and just asked.\u201cAre you okay without blood?\u201dAlthough older than Rudica, Rubica was not yet a fully grown vampire. I wondered if her vampire instinct was running wild.As I wondered about that, Rubica stared at me, swallowing her saliva.And she shook her head in my amazement.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m a grown vampire, so I can stand it.\u201dIt didn\u2019t look like that though, but I didn\u2019t want to ask for more because I didn\u2019t want a scene where these two vampire sisters were stuck on both my arms, drinking blood.Then Baros stepped forward and said to Rubica;\u201cHey, vampire. If you want my blood\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo. It smells bad.With the same reaction as Rudica before, Baros grew a little pale again.Apparently, the blood of an elf was not appetizing to a vampire.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thank you to transhumanist Sykes for the donation! ^^After that, the trip went smoothly.And as time passed, we finally arrived at Elrod Forest.The others and I stood still for a moment and looked around the entrance to the forest.It was a forest with that kind of spooky atmosphere because the trees were much larger than the trees from the ordinary forest.The Elrod Forest here was just a huge forest that was not that known to the world.The many mountain ranges and forests that existed on the continent were not individually named.It was just that the vampires living here called the forest by that name.\u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201dExcept for Baros, who had to protect the carriage, we immediately set out into the forest.I don\u2019t know how long it will take.The forest was so large that it was impossible to know how long it would take to find the vampires.Still, I wasn\u2019t worried we wouldn\u2019t be able to find it.As long as we kept moving deep into the forest, we would eventually run into them somehow.And I also bought an expensive compass from Domihawk because I thought we could get lost.Compared to a normal compass, it was a pair that showed each other\u2019s location. It was not a magical item, though, but probably something made of a material with properties similar to a magnet. Because this was a fantasy world.Anyway, the other one was with Baros, so there would be no problem going back.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of spooky.\u201dAs she was walking through the forest, Rubica looked around and said.The trees were so large that the sun was obscured, so it was a dark forest overall.I suddenly got curious and asked.\u201cDo vampires hate sunlight?\u201dEven during the day, they walked well under the sun, but I wondered if they hated it or something.Rubica looked at me curiously and shook her head.\u201cNo? It\u2019s not. Rather, I hate darker places like this.\u201dRight. That solved one question.It would take quite some time to wander around the forest to find the vampire tribe, so I brought plenty of food.However, they also supplied food through hunting. Of course, the hunting was up to Asher.And, of course, not only ordinary beasts but also monsters appeared.Kuung.A huge boar fell to Asher\u2019s sword and became a cold corpse.It was quite disgusting to see tiny thorns all over its body.Among the monsters that appeared in this forest, there were definitely some that I did not know.This was because the Elrod Forest itself was an unfamiliar field that had hardly been explored in the game. When I met vampires in related quests, I just passed by it for a moment.\u201cWow\u2026\u201dRudica\u2019s eyes lit up as Asher quickly defeated the monster and watched the other retrieve the sword.Because she had never seen Asher fought.Rubica, who had seen the massacre at the auction house, seemed to be a little afraid of Asher.\u201cHow can I be as strong as you?\u201dAt Rudica\u2019s question, Asher scratched her cheek in embarrassment.\u201cYou just have to train.\u201d\u201cHow do you train?\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Swinging the sword without a break every day. And also fight against stronger opponents.\u201dIt didn\u2019t seem easy to explain to a child.Rudica nodded and shouted.\u201cIf I live here, I will train every day! I have to become stronger to protect my sister and my new friends!\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201dAt those words, Rubica also had a gloomy look.Asher looked at the sisters with a slightly pitiful look.She also had a past when her clan was annihilated, so she could understand their experience.Anyway, it was already the third day after we started wandering around the forest like that.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201dAs we were walking down the forest road as usual, I felt something approaching us quickly.Asher and I turned our heads in that direction.From afar, I saw a figure leaping over the branches of the trees and sprinting towards us.Even from a distance, the other\u2019s image was clearly visible through my super sensory.A man with dark hair, red eyes, and dressed like a hunter suitable for the forest.\u3010Lv. 51]Vampire.A vampire.The level seen above his head was quite high at 51.The vampire we were searching for had finally appeared in front of us, and I felt joy, but I was also a little nervous.Then the vampire landed on a branch of a nearby tree, stopped and looked down at us. I also stared at him.Naturally, in the eyes of the other person, friendly feelings were not visible at all.\u201cHumans\u2026 and vampires?\u201dThe guy who was looking at us asked in a slightly confused voice.\u201cWhat are you? Why did you come into this forest?\u201dIt must have been a very unusual situation for him.No one usually came to such a deep part of the forest in the first place, but if the unexpected visitor was a combination of a human and a vampire.I asked him, perplexed.\u201cAre you from the vampire tribe of Elrod Forest?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How do you know vampires live in this forest, human?\u201dI replied in a no-nonsense tone.\u201cDo you think there is a perfect secret in this world? I\u2019ve heard that your people have lived in this forest for a very long time. To think that no one knows, that\u2019s arrogance.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201dHe just stared at me with eyes full of hostility, without saying a word.Beside me, the vampire sisters were staring at the other with a look of restlessness.I continued to speak.\u201cI have no malic when I said that. There is only one reason for coming to this forest. It\u2019s so these vampires who had lost their homes and tribe could have a new home her.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7What?\u201d\u201cThese are vampires who lived in the mountains north of Calderic. The tribes who lived there had a fight, so most of the tribe members died. They barely survived and escaped.\u201dHis gaze turned to the sisters.There must already be a few such vampires in the tribe of Elrod Forest, so he would have understood the situation right away with my explanation.\u201cSo, can\u2019t you be merciful and accept them as a member of your tribe? That\u2019s the only reason we came here.\u201dHe looked at the sisters and I silently, and said;\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t understand. Aside from the circumstances of those young vampires, why did you, a human, bring them here?\u201d\u201cI saved them from slave hunters. And I just knew that there was a vampire tribe living in this forest.\u201dIt was then that I felt other signs of people coming this way.Vampires, who just appeared, landed on either side of the branch in the direction the male vampire appeared.And when they found us, they looked startled, then frowned.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Humans and vampires? What\u2019s happening here, Floke?\u201dThe name of the vampire I was talking to was Floke.He explained the situation to his colleagues.The vampires glanced at us and made a strange expression after hearing all the explanations.They quietly discussed what to do for a moment. But I heard everything because of my super sensory.\u201cFirst of all, let\u2019s report it\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah, then one should watch them\u2026\u201dThey concluded what they should do and told me.\u201cDo nothing there and wait patiently, human. If you really have no other intentions and you\u2019re only here to help those young vampires, you should be able to do that.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dI answered obediently.It seemed that they were going to bring in a high-ranking vampire to decide what should they do to Rudika and Rubica, so we should wait here.The other vampires left again, and only one remained, watching us warily.He stood there silently, waiting for someone else to come.***A space with a gloomy atmosphere.A female vampire stood still, closed her eyes, and caught her breath.She was standing in front of a huge rock in the center of the room, and in a notch in the middle of the rock was a single red stone the size of a fist wrapped in black chains.An ominous stone that alone illuminated this underground space without a single light from the outside with fiery red light.Below the rock, there were other vampires watching it with anxious eyes.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201dThe woman slowly opened her eyes and put her hand on the red stone.When her hand touched it, the stone blew out an even more intense blood red light.An ominous energy emanating from the stone filled the space.The energy that made even vampires watching it tremble. The woman alone was receiving it.Then, the blood that flowed from her body was slowly absorbed into the stone.The woman\u2019s expression, who had maintained her composure, was then distorted with pain.But it wasn\u2019t just the blood being absorbed by the stone.Khahahahahahaha\u2026!A bizarre and terrifying laugh that gnawed at the soul.That overwhelming mental wave echoing in her head was something she couldn\u2019t get used to, even though she had experienced it dozens of times.The woman kept her consciousness that was about to collapse and waited for the end.The light from the stone slowly faded away.And the stone that returned to its original state seemed to have a little less red light than before.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Ha.\u201dThe woman who had successfully completed the ceremony stumbled down the stairs.The vampires waiting below rushed towards her.\u201cSister\u2026 are you okay?\u201dA man came forward and supported her.Throughout the ceremony, he was watching with painful eyes, as if he were doing it himself.The woman nodded and gently removed his arm.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t make a fuss about.\u201dSeeing her still trembling while saying that, the man\u2019s face became even more troubled.A ritual to suppress the energy of blood.It was a duty that the chieftains have inherited from generation to generation, and it was also a responsibility that must be fulfilled for the peace of the tribe.Therefore, as the ceremony progressed, there was nothing the man could do while watching her sister lose her lifespan.The man turned his gaze and looked again at the stone embedded in the rock.How long did the tribe have to waste the lives of their brethren for that damn thing? Until when\u2026\u201cRest, sister. Take care of the chieftain.\u201dOut of the underground space, the woman left with the other vampires.The man looked back at her and sighed.At that time, a vampire from the other side ran towards this side quickly. It was a warrior tasked with periodically reconnaissance of the forest.\u201cChief Warrior.\u201dThe man looked at the other with puzzled eyes.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dHearing the report that followed, the man frowned slightly.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Humans brought young vampires? How did he know about our tribe?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know myself. That\u2019s why I hurriedly reported it to you.\u201d\u201cHow many humans were there?\u201d\u201cOnly two.\u201dThe man glanced in the direction the woman had disappeared and then nodded.\u201cI will go directly with the warriors.

In addition, their level was all over 60.As if they were coming to fight some kind of battle, Asher\u2019s expression hardened, and the two sisters looked around with a frightened face.\u201cIt really is a human.\u201dOne vampire said as if muttering.I made eye contact with him.It was immediately recognizable that he was the leader of their group.It was because of the level above his head.\u3010Lv. 81]After checking the level, I could immediately recognize his identity.Of the vampire tribes of Elrod Forest, there was only one strong person who reached this level.Chief Warrior Calderban.The chief\u2019s younger brother and the strongest warrior of Elrod Forest.As I recalled, five years later, his level was 83, which was higher than it was now.I didn\u2019t expect him to suddenly come out of here.\u201cHuman, answer the question properly.\u201dHe was exchanging glances with me, and then he opened his mouth.\u201cHow did you know our tribe existed in this forest?\u201dI had given a moderate answer earlier, but it seemed like they were trying to get a more definite answer.Probably because this was a very important issue to them.For a long time, they had been quietly living in this forest, avoiding the eyes of the public, but out of nowhere, a human who knew their existence suddenly appeared.After thinking for a while, I answered.\u201cIsn\u2019t it more strange that I don\u2019t know?\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7What?\u201d\u201cEven though this forest is not visited by others, this is the realm of Calderic. The eyes of the Lords are everywhere and there are many intelligence organizations. You have lived in this forest for nearly 100 years. If you truly thought that no one would know of your existence, that\u2019s simply arrogance.\u201dIndeed, the Overlord and some Lords were aware of their existence. They didn\u2019t think of them as a threat, so they just leave them alone.And they had actually settled in the Elrod Forest for over 200 years. I purposely said it wrong.It was to make them think I didn\u2019t understand everything. Because if I knew too much, their boundaries would become stronger.I could feel Rubica looking at me with a puzzled look.Because when I explained to her, I told her I had a relationship with the vampire tribe from this forest.She might wonder why I didn\u2019t say that to these vampires, but it was a lie, so I couldn\u2019t say it. In the first place, the vampires of Elrod Forest lived and died in this forest for the rest of their lives, so how could anyone have met them?Anyway, the chief warrior, who was staring at me without responding, seemed to be convinced to some extent. He changed the subject.\u201cYou said you rescued the two vampires who were captured as slaves and you came here to bring them to our tribe. Are they those children?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dRubica, who was watching, stepped forward and said.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7We are vampires who lived in the mountains north of Calderic! And they rescued us with genuine good intentions and brought us here.\u201dThe atmosphere was harsh, so she seemed to want to defend me.He glanced at her, then nodded.\u201cIf you have lost a place to return to, our tribe will welcome you with open arms.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201d\u201cBut not the humans. We can never bring them into the village. So, send the children there first.\u201dAt that, they looked at me with anxious eyes.I nodded my head.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, go.\u201dThey hesitated and moved to the side of the vampires.The chief warrior nodded to one vampire.After receiving that nod, the vampire took the sisters in her arms and climbed the branches and moved into the forest. And then they disappeared in an instant.I turned my gaze to the chief warrior.Now it was time to bring my purpose out.\u201cI have a story I want to tell you.\u201dI stopped talking.Because the atmosphere suddenly became serious.The hostility felt from the vampires standing around us as if they were surrounding us grew stronger. And\u2026Aww!The sudden attack from the front was blocked by Asher instead.A thorn made of blood shattered to pieces by her sword.Her expression ferociously distorted, and she glared at the vampires.I looked at the chief warrior and asked.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dHe answered in a calm tone.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you can\u2019t leave the forest alive.\u201d\u201cIs it because I was aware of your tribe\u2019s existence? Didn\u2019t I just say that I wasn\u2019t the only one who knew about you?\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it.\u201dHe shook his head.\u201cThank you very much for saving our people. But we\u2019ve never let an outsider who has entered this forest leave alive. That\u2019s how we have kept our home and peace for many years, and there are no exceptions.\u201dThe vampires around them immediately took a fighting stance.The blood that flowed from their bodies gathered in the air and formed a shape. Some were huge, some are sharp.\u201cSo die here, human.\u201dI sighed inwardly.These dog-like vampire cubs\u2026.Did I think too easily?I saved their people, so I didn\u2019t expect they would still try to kill us like this.Soon there was blood rushing all over the place where we were standing.I grabbed Asher\u2019s shoulder, preparing for battle, and pulled him closer.\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\u201cStand close to me.\u201dAnd I immediately opened the floating veil.At the same time, attacks poured in from all sides.***The non-stop blood flow saturated the place where the humans were standing.While the other warriors were pouring out their attacks, the chief warrior Calderban also prepared an attack with all his might.Uh uh.The blood that flowed from his body condensed in the air and turned purple.It was a unique blood skill he possessed. If somebody was hit by this extremely poisonous blood, no matter how strong the opponent was, they had no choice but to melt away without a trace.Violet blood formed as huge thorns rotated like a whirlpool and swept the place where the humans stood.Aww!The site swept away by the bloodstream disappeared as it was, leaving ruins.Without evading the bombardment of the elite warriors, the humans were directly hit.Calderban had no doubts that this was the end.However, his eyes widened in astonishment at the sight that was revealed after the blood and dust had disappeared.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7!\u201dThe humans were still standing in the same place. Even without a single piece of clothing ruffled.The chief warrior and other warriors were in shock at the sight beyond the common sense and did not take any action.This makes little sense\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7The human man looked around leisurely.\u201cIs this the end?\u201dHe spoke in an arrogant and indifferent voice, as if muttering.\u201cThis doesn\u2019t feel good.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If I opened my mouth, it would be over.Still, the vampires all froze on the spot.Now what?If a full-fledged battle continued like this, we were going to lose.I was too busy protecting my body, so it\u2019s hard to use instant kill.And this was their home. It was possible for them to continuously replenish power.No matter how much vampire Asher defeated, it would just be a fight with no end.Damn, should I have been more careful about coming to this forest?\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I.\u201dI turned my gaze away when I heard a bewildered voice next to me.Asher, who was almost in my arms, couldn\u2019t find a place to turn her gaze.I sighed and let go of her shoulders. I was so nervous that I forgot.Asher looked around the ruined radius with a slightly puzzled face.I had never used the Floating Veil in front of her, except for a brief use during the Orc King\u2019s attack.I looked at the chief warrior again and said.\u201cAre you going to do more?\u201dThe only thing I could do was to bluff, so I had no choice but to overcome the situation with that.He didn\u2019t respond and just stared at me. There was a look of tension in his eyes that differed from before.\u201cYou were so confident before. How stupid.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know who I am, and you don\u2019t know how much power gap there is between us. You should be glad that I don\u2019t have any hostility towards you. Or your tribe would have all perished today.\u201d\u201cHuman, who are you?\u201dAt my words, he asked with an angry expression.It was the flow of conversation that I intended, so I tried to answer right away. And that was the moment.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7?\u201dI sensed someone rushing from afar at a formidable speed.Shwaah!A bloody sphere that flew through the trees, drawing traces that were drooping.The vampires looked at the sphere in surprise.A sphere stopped in front of me. A little further from where I was standing, it slowly formed into a person and a woman appeared.She put on the robe that she took out from the sphere and put it over her messy hair.\u3010Lv. 67]\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Sister!\u201dThe chief warrior shouted in amazement.At that call, I immediately knew her identity.Chieftain?Aklina, chieftain of the Elrod Forest tribe.It was just her unique blood technique to turn the body into blood itself.After the chief warrior, now the chieftain had come out.\u201cYou\u2019re too close, sister! He\u2019s a dangerous human, so step back!\u201dShe looked around the ruins once and met my eyes.\u201cI heard that there are humans who rescued young vampires\u2026 Please explain what the situation is, Calderban.\u201dThe chief warrior seemed to flinch at her cold voice.\u201cYou did not report about what happened and then even attacked them?\u201dThe chief warrior and the other vampires could say nothing.The chieftain let out a small sigh and looked towards me. Her eyes and mine met.\u201cI am the chieftain, Aklina.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201d\u201cOn behalf of the tribe, I sincerely apologize for the atrocities committed by my tribe members.\u201dI was relieved once I heard that.It was because her attitude showed that she had no intention of attacking us.Unlike the warriors, who were especially wary and hostile toward other races in the game, the chieftain had a relatively finite personality, like the head of a peaceful tribe.Still, since they attacked first, I said.\u201cIf it were any other ordinary human who came to this forest, they would have already died. Are you going to apologize to the cold corpse like you do now?\u201dThe chieftain sighed once more and said.\u201cAs you know, the awareness of vampires in the world is not very good. This is the only place we can live normally, so we have to be extremely sensitive to other races entering our tribe\u2019s land. Please understand our situation a little.\u201dI just clicked my tongue once and said nothing more.Anyway, I came all the way here, because I had my purpose.But before that\u2026\u201cI am the Seventh Lord of Calderic.\u201dOriginally, I had no intention of saying anything. Because they would only be more vigilant.However, given the situation, it\u2019s important to make sure that none of what happened earlier happened again.The topic I wanted to discuss with them was also a very sensitive issue directly related to the fate of their tribe.At my words, the vampires, including the chieftain and the chief warrior, all seemed to be startled.Even those who lived far away from the world cannot be unaware of the status and strength of the existence of a Lord in Calderic.\u201cA Lord?\u201dIn particular, it was noticeable that the expression of the chieftain, who had remained calm, collapsed in an instant.She asked in a slightly trembling voice.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 As I recall, the Seventh Lord is not a human, but a beastman.\u201dWhat she was talking about was the former Seventh Lord.She didn\u2019t even know that the Seventh Lord\u2019s seat was vacated by his death and that I had recently occupied it. Because in this forest, it was almost impossible to be updated from the current news.\u201cThe former Seventh Lord was dead. And I am the new lord.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Would you like to hear it?\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Story?\u201d\u201cI came to this forest to take the vampire sisters, but I also have another purpose. It\u2019s about the \u2018blood crystal\u2019 of your tribe.\u201dThe vampires looked at me in amazement.They wouldn\u2019t have expected that the word \u2018blood crystal\u2019 would come out of the mouth of an outsider who came to the forest out of nowhere.\u201cHow do you know about the \u2018blood crystal\u2019?\u201dThe chieftain, who had come to her senses, now looked at me with hostile eyes.Blood crystal.It was the biggest trouble that the vampire tribes of the Elrod Forest currently harbored.I couldn\u2019t remember all the details of the background, but I remembered some important things roughly.Ancestor Gascalid.A time in the past, far before the tribes settled down in Elrod Forest.Among the ancestors of these tribes was a powerful vampire.He was an evil and ferocious vampire, unlike his descendants, who became a peaceful tribe. He was more like the current Sixth Lord.He was defeated by an unknown archmage and was mortally wounded, and in the end, it was said that he died at the end of his life.The death of a vampire did not differ from the death of other creatures. The bones and flesh rotted, and the body returned to nature.However, he tried to maintain his existence until the moment of his death, not letting go of the lust for life.That\u2019s how \u2018blood crystal\u2019 was created.A stone in which the soul and blood of Gascalid are sleeping.I think one of the elder vampires explained how that was possible in the game, but I couldn\u2019t remember. It was just a setting anyway, so it didn\u2019t matter.The important thing was that the descendants took care of the evil stone that was like an image of Gascalid.Along with the prophecy that the day when Gascalid was resurrected was the day the tribe would be destroyed, they had been performing rituals for generations to quell the blood crystal.But the problem was the aftermath of the ritual.A ceremony in which the blood of the chieftain, who inherited the blood of Gascalid, sacrificed their own blood to calm the blood crystal.It was a ritual that not only sacrificed the blood, but also ate away the vitality and spirit of the person who performed it.In a word, the chieftain of the Elrod Forest was destined to be short-lived the more they performed the ritual.Even now, it was barely sealed, so they couldn\u2019t move it anywhere, and it would be irresponsible if they left it alone and left the forest.Without being able to do this or that, the tribes of Elrod Forest had been squeezing the lives of the chieftain for generations.And the reason I came to Elrod Forest was to solve that problem.My purpose was to gain the vampire\u2019s \u2018blood magic\u2019 ability that could be obtained in solving it.\u201cI know your ancestor, Gascalid.\u201dNow that we\u2019re ready to talk to each other, it\u2019s time to speak up.The chieftain, who was staring at me, widened his eyes at those words.\u201cWhat just\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the reason I know about the cursed thing your ancestor placed on you.\u201dI unravelled the story I had envisioned in my head.\u201cHalion, the chieftain sealed the blood of Gascalid himself. Do you know?\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201d\u201cIf you are a chieftain, of course you know, since the records of your ancestors remain. I had a relationship with him, and he entrusted me with a request. One day, when the time is right, I was asked to completely annihilate the blood crystal.\u201d\u201cHold on, wait.\u201dShe stopped me from contunuing. She had obviously become increasingly confused by my words.\u201cSo\u2026 you mean a few hundred years ago when our ancestors were still alive?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAt that, Asher looked back at me with a slightly startled expression.Of course, it was a lie, but even if it was true, there was nothing wrong with it.As you can see by looking at the Lords, for the superhumans who have crossed their boundaries in this world, the basic lifespan of a body was several hundred years.I spoke with a slightly solemn face.\u201cI came here to keep that request. So, guide me to the place where the blood crystal is.\u201dIt\u2019s very absurd, but it\u2019s hard not to believe it.Or how would an outsider know about blood spririt and their ancestor?I waited for the chieftain\u2019s answer.She, who had a complicated face as if in agony, bowed her head.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you don\u2019t have to.\u201d\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Huh?\u201cThis is a matter for our clan. I can\u2019t just listen to a few words and leave the matter of blood crystal to an outsider. I\u2019m sorry if everything you say is really true, but if you care about us, please go back.\u201dThe return was a resolute refusal.I was a little embarrassed because I didn\u2019t know that she would give me a knife-like refusal.\u201cNo, sister. We need to hear more of the story\u2026\u201dRather, the chief warrior, who had been more hostile towards me, panicked and stopped her.\u201cGoodbye then.\u201dShe bowed to me once more and turned around firmly.I looked at the back with a bit of embarrassment and then opened my mouth again.\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7At least, I couldn\u2019t come this far and just give up.\u201cThen I\u2019ll have to force my way in.\u201dAt my words, her steps stopped.Then she looked at me with a hardened face.\u201cActually, I don\u2019t need your permission. This is an oath between me and your ancestor, and it must be kept.\u201d\u201c\u2026Even though I said that you don\u2019t need to?\u201dI said shamelessly in a cold voice.\u201cYeah. So, if you don\u2019t want more clashes, lead me to the blood crystal. I don\u2019t want to see the blood of the descendants of my dead friend flow here.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She made eye contact with me, who was staring at her.It was us who fell behind in power. Would \u00a0they rekindle a situation that had calmed down at best?But it was unacceptable to give up blood magic so easily and go back.So I would try to do everything I could.If persuasion didn\u2019t work, I had no choice but to push through with threats or bluffing.\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7She\u2019s considering it.After gaining super sensory, he became especially sensitive to understanding other people\u2019s emotions.Every minute change in facial expression was clearly visible, so it was not weird for me to understand it.She was keeping her expression as expressionless as possible as if she would not show any emotion, but she could not completely hide it.\u201cYou mean you\u2019re going to go to war with our whole tribe now? Even though you\u2019re alone?\u201dWas I crazy? Why would I do that?But the opposite of what I thought came out of my mouth. And rather brazenly too. I shook my head.\u201cWar is an appropriate term when two opposing teams have equal strength to some extent. You are not enough to stop me.\u201dA human who threatened to deal with a tribe that would be in the thousands alone.But none of the vampires could laugh at me.It was a world where several people was meaningless in front of one superhuman.I had already stated that I was a Lord. I also showed an overwhelming prestige by completely blocking the previous attacks.They could never dismiss my words as bluffs.I spouted hostility and continued to look at the vampires staring at me full of tension.\u201cEven if you somehow killed me, nothing will change. Because the other Lords would surely intervene. Then I don\u2019t think I need to explain what would happen to your tribe.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201d\u201cSo choose wisely, Chieftain.\u201dShe bit her lipsI was putting a lot of pressure on them right now.The matter of blood crystal was a very serious thing that they couldn\u2019t just give to an outsider who claimed that he was a friend of their ancestor, and if they didn\u2019t guide me, I would still enter their tribe recklessly.That\u2019s why she looked very embarrassed right now.I apologized, but let\u2019s just say it\u2019s your fault for attacking me first.If it wasn\u2019t for the floating veil, I would have died dozens of times already.How peaceful it was to be blackmailed only with words like this.\u201cMy only purpose is to destroy the blood crystal. That is a promise I must keep.\u201d\u201cAre you making these kinds of threats\u2026 and want us to trust you?\u201d\u201cTrust, that\u2019s good too. Anyway, I was just trying to let you know you don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201d\u201cHow long will your clan hold that cursed object in your arms? I know the rituals of bloodshed. Are you afraid of a clone of your ancestors who will never be resurrected, and will you continue to force such sacrifices on your bloodline? \u201cBeing too harsh was also not good. If you push too hard and threatened them, it\u2019s all over.Instead of just a whip, I gave them a carrot.After all, they couldn\u2019t trust me, so what\u2019s the hesitation if I was sure I could handle the blood crystal?The chieftain seemed to be in deep anguish.I said no more and waited for an answer from her.\u201c\u2026At least explain how you intend to destroy the blood crystal.\u201dShe\u2019s asking that too.Since this was an expected question, I answered calmly.\u201cI will completely annihilate the soul of your ancestor, who sleeps in the blood crystal. It\u2019s not too difficult for me.\u201dTo be honest, I wasn\u2019t sure about how to deal with the blood crystal.Because I didn\u2019t mean to deal with it the same way it was dealt in the game.In the game\u2019s story, the player\u2019s wizard ally destroyed the soul of Gascalid by borrowing the power of a powerful artifact.And if the soul was treated like that, those who were nearby naturally absorbed the masterless blood magic left on the stone. Regardless of race, like a mystery.I didn\u2019t have any such relics and there were no conditions to get them, so the attack on the blood crystal I saw in the game was something that I couldn\u2019t do.But I believed in something.The [Soul of the King] which protected my mind.And an instant kill that could kill any target.With these two abilities I had, I could block Gascalid\u2019s mental attacks and completely annihilate his soul by coming into contact with the blood crystal.I still don\u2019t know if instant kill actually works on souls, but\u2026Still, it was the one and only 10-star skill in the game. It didn\u2019t seem like it wouldn\u2019t work on a spirit body.It was just a hunch, but it was a feeling close to certainty. Just like the last time I met the Golem Guardian in the dungeon.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201dThe chieftain, who had been silent for a while, took a deep breath and said.\u201cI don\u2019t know what the promise you made with our ancestor meant. You are the one who threatens the long-standing peace of our tribe.\u201dShe turned around and said.\u201cFollow me, I\u2019ll guide you.\u201d\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Done.Her voice was cold and full of reluctance, but I didn\u2019t care and was happy inside.The vampires also came down from the tree one by one and escorted her around as if to protect her from me.The chief warrior also glanced at me with a complicated face and stuck to her side.So I followed them and walked along with Asher.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s like something you would see in the city.Although they lived in the wild, the size of the tribe and the fact that they had been in this place for a long time, it was almost like a small city.\u201cWhat about the vampires I brought?\u201dWhen asked about the two sisters\u2019 whereabouts, the chieftain answered.\u201cOur tribe does not exclude vampires from outside the forest. We will help them adjust to life here without any difficulties.\u201dOn the road leading to the village, I saw the sisters with a vampire. It was the vampire who took them away.When the sisters found me, they screamed in relief and ran to me.\u201cRon!\u201dIt was a strong reaction, as if we hadn\u2019t seen each other for a while.Rubica glanced at the chieftain once and said to me.\u201cWe didn\u2019t even say goodbye properly, so I thought we\u2019d never see each other again\u2026 Did something happen? I think I heard a fight before\u2026\u201dAt those words, the chief warrior slowly turned his head and avoided her gaze.As soon as you disappeared, I wanted to say that they started a surprise attack, but they gave up and I won in the end.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d\u201cAre you going to leave now?\u201dShe took turns looking at me and Asher with a slightly sad look.\u201cI still have a problem to solve here, so I\u2019ll just deal with it and leave. Don\u2019t worry about me. Now you can live well with them.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad you found a new home.\u201dRudica burst into tears, and Rubica soon nodded with tears in her eyes.I didn\u2019t know that even Rubica would react like this, so I was a little perplexed.\u201cThank you very much, Ron. I will live with gratitude for the goodwill you have shown us for the rest of my life.\u201dI nodded my head without a word.\u201cKeep going.\u201dI urged the chieftain, who was watching the scene with strange eyes from the side, and started moving again.As we moved to the depths of the village, the chieftain paused for a moment.\u201cPlease wait here. We must inform the elders first.\u201dA few vampires scattered in different directions, probably to call those elders.After waiting for a while, the old vampires gathered one by one.\u201cChieftain.\u201dThey gathered around the chieftain and talked for a while as they glanced over here.As soon as they reached a conclusion, an old man with gray hair, who seemed to be the oldest of the elder vampires, approached me.\u201cI heard you are a close friend of one of our previous chieftains who can solve the problem of blood crystal. We could only believe what you have said because we have no choice.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dHe looked at me quietly and said.\u201cCan we watch the process of disposing of the blood crystal? Please, this is our only condition.\u201dIt meant that they would at least watch if I was doing anything stupid.I nodded my head, as it was otherwise irrelevant.So, along with the chieftain, the warrior chief, and the elders, I went straight to the place where the blood crystal was.It was a cave quite far from the village. Other vampires stood guard at the entrance.After going inside and going down the sloped cave path, a large underground space appeared.There was a huge rock in the center, and the red stone embedded on top of it was shining brightly and illuminating the surroundings with blood red light.Is that the blood crystal?I gazed at the stone that was emitting an aura that was so ominous at first glance.It was like the scenery I saw in the game that remained in my memory.The chieftain said to me.\u201cThat\u2019s the blood crystal. We did a ritual a while ago, so its energy is weak now.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d\u201cDo you want to start right now?\u201dI nodded and walked up the stairs to the rock.The closer I got to the stone, the more the ominous energy stabbed me. I hadn\u2019t even touched the stone yet.\u3010Lv. 95]The level displayed just above the blood crystal was a very good sign of how strong the energy was.But I wasn\u2019t worried.As in the game, what a mere ghost could inflict was not physical damage.If it\u2019s just a mental attack, I believe the [Soul of the King] would completely block it. So there was no hesitation in my steps.Standing right in front of the blood crystal, I slowly reached out towards it.And as soon as I touched the stone, I felt an overwhelming presence invade my mind.\u2018\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!\u2019A loud laughter echoed in my head.The soul of Gascalid.I quietly put my hands up and heard him chatter.\u2018What. Are you human? Far from inheriting my blood, someone who is not a vampire dares to touch my spirit?\u2019Whoa!The color of blood emanating from the stone grew stronger.As his presence grew stronger, I could feel him emitting a flash to shake my mind.How strong the mental wave was. The cave vibrated weakly, and even the vampires below staggered while holding their heads.But it was as if I was alone in the middle of the eye of the typhoon.With a very peaceful mind, I watched him riot. I was a little nervous at first though, but it\u2019s really nothing.Shortly thereafter, a voice of a bewildered man was heard.\u2018What, what are you\u2026? Why haven\u2019t you lost your mind yet?!\u2019I also talked to him.\u2018Hey, ghost.\u2019\u2018\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Huh?\u2019\u2018Oh, can you hear me? Anyway, thank you, I will use your abilities well.\u2019It was a very sincere thank you.Now, I immediately activated instant kill to make it easier.\u2018Die.\u2019Coo coo.Its presence disappeared in an instant, and the vibration stopped.As the energy that filled the cave disappeared as if it had evaporated, the vampires looked up at this side.I ignored their gaze and stared down at the fading blood color on the stone.Soon, even that faint blood color was all scattered and was absorbed into my body through the hand touching the stone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Because it\u2019s really over with just the use of my one hand.\u201cDid you destroy the soul of our ancestor in the blood crystal?\u201d\u201cYeah. That rock won\u2019t go wild anymore.\u201dSince I destroyed the soul and ate even the blood magic, there was no more energy left in it. It was now just an ordinary stone.The elder vampires looked at each other and let out a sigh of relief.In particular, the chief warrior could not contain his emotion.\u201cSister! There is no need to perform any more ceremonies. You don\u2019t have to waste your life anymore!\u201dLooking at it, I remembered the Elrod Forest episode in the game.It was said that the chieftain at the time of sealing the blood crystal died.The chieftains had given their life force to suppress the energy of the blood crystal through rituals.As the years passed, it had become a natural responsibility of the chieftain and a tribal custom.The chief warrior also inherited Gascalid\u2019s lineage, but he was such an accomplished warrior for the tribe that no one wanted his life to be wasted in rituals.In fact, the chief warrior always had great guilt and regret for his sister who became the chieftain by replacing himself.Knowing this background, it was understandable that he was so happy now.Well, anyway, that\u2019s all.My body was itching because I wanted to go out quickly and check the blood magic I just received.***After looking around for a long time to see the vampires that had lost their energy, the vampires finally accepted that the issue of blood crystal had been resolved.Coming out of the cave, they formally thanked me.\u201cThank you very much. I also sincerely apologize for doubting your promise to our ancestor. Thanks to the Lord, our tribe has finally found true peace today.\u201dThe chieftains, warriors, and elders bowed their heads deeply.Their attitude towards me was instantly the opposite of how they had been before, but I had no intention of blaming them.It was me who pushed in recklessly in the first place, so that was a natural response. I didn\u2019t treat them with pure good intentions either anyway.\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Lord.\u201dEven the chief warrior apologized once again to me as if he was guilty.Yes, you should be sorry.He bowed his head, and I wanted to slap the exposed head of the other once, but I resisted it.Instead, I spoke to confirm the newly gained ability.\u201cTry using blood magic once.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Yes?\u201dAt my sudden request, the chief warrior raised his head and blinked.I said again.\u201cI told you to unleash your blood skills. Just like the attack you did to me before.\u201d\u201cUh, why are you\u2026?\u201d\u201cHurry.\u201dAs soon as I told him to do it, the chief warrior finally tilted his head and stretched out his hand in the air.Then, slowly, his complexion turned into a look of embarrassment, and he made a bewildered sound.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Uh?\u201dAs if something was not going well, the chief warrior could not spread his blood skills at all. The surrounding vampires looked at him strangely.This is it.After checking the performance roughly, I took back my ability.Then, the chief warrior could practice blood magic again normally. Blood pooled on his hands.\u201cWhat, what?\u201d\u201cWhy are you acting like this, chief warrior?\u201d\u201cElder, just for a moment, the blood magic\u2026 No, it\u2019s nothing.\u201dHe looked at his hands in bewilderment.A unique ability of Gascalid\u2019s blood magic.It was to take the blood of other vampires as they were and use them.This was an ability that could be unfolded if the opponent was within a certain range, as there was no condition of contact like instant kill.Vampires exposed to Gascalid\u2019s blood magic could not use their own blood magic as they did before.In a word, if the opponent was a vampire, the ability that did not differ from fraud. Of course, if the opponent was stronger or equal to you, the blood magic wouldn\u2019t work at all, or it would take time to fully control it.Now that I rarely meet a vampire, it\u2019s not a very useful ability.It was good to have such a unique ability.The only thing I needed in the first place was the ability to freely control my blood, which was a common passive of all blood magic.There was nothing more to do, so I immediately left the forest with Asher.Then the vampires caught me.\u201cYou can\u2019t let the benefactor go like this. If you have anything you want, please tell me. As much as possible\u2026\u201d\u201cThen, the vampires I brought, please take care of them.\u201dI already had what I wanted, and there was nothing to gain from this tribe other than that.At my answer, the vampires looked at me with more reverence.They didn\u2019t know that I had absorbed the power of their ancestor.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I will never forget the kindness that the Lord has given upon our tribe.\u201dAnyway, that\u2019s how I left the vampires\u2019 home.After getting some distance, I said to Asher.\u201cWait here for a minute.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAsher answered with a puzzled look.I left her and moved into the thick forest.Soon, when I couldn\u2019t feel her presence completely, I stopped and looked around.I stretched out my hand in the air and properly spread the blood.Uh uh.The blood that passed through the skin from the palm and seep into it floated up.I looked at it curiously, moved it around, and tried to put it together in the shape of a ball.The blood swam through the air at my will.This is the feeling.It did not differ from a telekinetic force that only worked on my blood.It felt like I was flapping my wings for the first time, even though those wings didn\u2019t exist at all.I filled the blood I was controlling and shot it at the tree in front of me. Make it sharp like a thorn.Whoops!A powerful shot of blood collided with the tree and broke the bark a little.\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Well, it is quite fast.It was much faster than an arrow, but it had no power at all.Earlier, when vampires attacked me and used blood magic, they blew up the entire forest and showed tremendous power.But I couldn\u2019t.Because I was a human, not a vampire.To remember, in the game race setting, vampires said that their blood density and regenerative power itself differed from other races.That\u2019s why it was possible to extract such an absurd amount of blood from a body of a size no different from that of a human and use it as a weapon.So, no matter how much blood I got, unless my race was a vampire, I couldn\u2019t produce such an abnormal power.In short, the weapon was a machine gun, but the bullet inside was a BB pellet.Gascalid\u2019s unique ability, blood stealing. It looked like I could use it with its original power, considering that the chief warrior\u2019s blood skill was completely sealed earlier, but blood manipulation was limited to this level.There is a lot of heterogeneity.In the first place, there was a sense of disparity felt when manipulating blood. It was not suitable for me because I was a human being.If this sense of heterogeneity was reduced, I could increase the speed even more than it was now.Does it increase as you continue to use it?Actually, for me, power wasn\u2019t the most important part.If the enemy came into contact with my blood anyway, I could kill them, so what did it matter? It was just a little sad.And there is also super-regeneration, so there will be no pressure to use blood magic.This time, I shot the blood floating in the air by dividing it into three branches.It was a lot more difficult to control when I tried to shoot them separately.In any case, it was very encouraging to get the ability to maximize the efficiency of instant kill.The defense was floating veil, and the attack was instant kill using blood magic, and even super sensory.With these abilities combination, now, most things wouldn\u2019t be a threat to me.There are still weaknesses.It was still difficult to use instant kill if the enemy was too fast to hit with blood, or if they were wearing a full body armor and using a shield.But the strength of my instant kill was that no one knew about this ability.Even if I encountered such an enemy, if I was vigilant enough, I could deal with them somehow.I stood with my arms crossed and thought about it, then turned my head to one side.There was something approaching this way.It was a huge wild boar the size of a house.It was also the monster we encountered the most while wandering through the forest.The guy who found me snorted and rushed right in.I put a drop of blood on my finger and shoot it at him.As soon as it came into contact with the blood, its body relaxed and it slipped as it had been running and rolled on the ground noisily.I stared at the wild boar, who was lying on the ground and no longer moving, then I turned around, stirring up the dust that had risen.\u201cShould I stop?\u201dI had tried enough of my newly gained blood skills, and now I had to go back to where Asher was.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There would come a time when I would have to use it openly, so there was no reason to hide it.As it was the first time she saw me using blood magic, I felt her constantly glancing at me.\u201cDo you have anything to say?\u201dAs I spoke, she looked carefully and asked.\u201cSir Ron\u2026 are you a vampire?\u201dI answered with a laugh.\u201cDo I look like a vampire?\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7No, you look like a human.\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019m human.\u201dBut how could you control blood?I could feel Asher staring at me with that kind of question in her gaze, but I had no intention of answering that question.There was no need to tell her I had absorbed the blood magic from the blood crystal.After practicing blood magic for quite some time, I stopped.Now the next destination\u2026The original plan was to leave the Elrod Forest and go directly to the next mystery.That\u2019s how the plan turned out when I found a vampire in the middle. As a result, I successfully obtained blood magic and everything went well.The next destination was the First Lord\u2019s territory, as planned.The mystery to be obtained there was a mystery that was close to a defense-type ability.Space leap.As the name suggested, it was a mystery that could teleport.Space-related abilities were very rare in this world.In normal games, if you are a wizard, you could use magic to teleport, but in the world of RaSa, this was not the case.There were very few magicians who could use space-based magic, and there were also many restrictions.This one must be difficult to find\u2026Already, it felt like a tightness was accumulating in my chest.Finding the mystery had never been easy, but this time it was especially so.Gaitan Lake, in the First Lord\u2019s territory.The mystery of space leap was hidden somewhere in that great lake.In short, there were a lot of things to prepare for because I had to do underwater exploration.Anyway, after getting that, there is only one mystery left.The last mystery I plan to get after getting space leap was not something I was planning to use.But it was also a mystery I must get above all else.It was something that I should prevent that person from getting.However, since its location was in one of the magical places that existed on this continent, it was inevitable for me to find other mysteries and raise my specs first\u2026Maybe it\u2019s already too late.In fact, I didn\u2019t know exactly when that person discovered the mystery, so maybe it was already too late.No, it was likely. If you look at these and other things, that person might have been looking for it years ago and prepared to get it by now.Still, nothing is certain yet, so I\u2019ll have to look to make sure.For now, though, I should focus on finding the mystery of the space leap.The present, five years ago from the background of the game\u2019s play.More time had passed, so there were less than five years left until the main story began.Had it been almost half a year since I started wandering around Calderic?I looked out the window, thinking that the journey was slowly ending.***Asher glanced at the Seventh Lord, who was staring out the window.At first, she thought all she had to do was do her duty as an escort without worrying about this or that.However, it had already been almost half a year since they started wandering around Calderic, and the many unexpected appearances he showed during that time made her curious about the Seventh Lord.Sometimes he was so ordinary that she didn\u2019t even think he was a Lord, and at other times he seemed like a good man who couldn\u2019t stand injustice.At other times, he looked like a cold-blooded person without blood or tears, and at other times he looked like a transcendent who had no interest in everything in the world.Not only the disposition, but also the ability.Like the ability to kill an opponent with just words, or that invisible shield.The ability to manipulate blood that he had just shown was also something she had never seen before.Considering the conversations he had with the vampires, he had a deep connection with their ancestor hundreds of years ago, but it was unknown whether his blood magic ability had anything to do with it.A person who is hard to fathom.However, there was one thing she could be sure of, that he wasn\u2019t close to a villain.He did not turn a blind eye to the dying; he rescued the captives, and he solved a major problem for a tribe\u2019s peace.Although his actions might have some intention in them, she still wanted to believe that it didn\u2019t originate from a bad place.\u201cAre you focusing on your escort duty?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cIt seems like you keep looking at my face.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Sorry.\u201dAsher blamed herself for being preoccupied by useless things, and just focused on her escort duty again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even if the conditions were strict.\u201cUm, so\u2026\u201dThe staff of the Adventurer\u2019s Guild who listened to me asked as if to confirm.\u201cYou mean you\u2019re looking for adventurers who can use both enchantment magic and underwater breathing magic at the same time?\u201dI nodded.\u201cAnd it would be better if they had some knowledge about the Gaitan Lake.\u201dThe staff smiled a little awkwardly. It was a laugh showing that she\u2019s a bit troubled by my request.I understood her reaction.Because the conditions I was requesting were pretty difficult to meet, and I really wanted to find an adventurer who would fit them perfectly.Enchantment magic.As the name suggested, it was a magic that granted magical effects to targets other than the caster.In this world, items imprinted with magic were only auxiliary tools for mages to use magic more easily.The more complex the engraving was, the more quickly it would be erased from the mana stone, or something like that. I read a book about it at my castle, but I couldn\u2019t quite remember it.So, mages engraved only the important parts of the rite and used it by filling in only the middle, but those who did not know magic cannot use it because it was not possible.In ancient times, there was a technique for storing magic skills for a long time, but that technique no longer existed until the present day.So, even in the game, items with active magic that could be used by people other than mages were quite rare.Anyway, for that reason, enchantment magic had a very high status in this world.Even more so because there weren\u2019t many mages that could use it.In this world, magical power must also be innate. So if the nature of someone\u2019s magic did not match a certain type of magic, no matter how high their mana was, it was impossible to use it. This was the case with space-based magic or enchantment magic.There must be someone who could at least use underwater breathing magic.There\u2019s a question on why should a mage even learn such a skill.Of course, there\u2019s nothing wrong with learning it, but it\u2019s normal to learn much more useful and powerful magic.In a word, it would be very difficult to find a mage who could use underwater breathing magic along with enchantment magic.In order to explore the lake, I had to find it, so I had no choice but to tell the truth to the guild staff.\u201cAren\u2019t there any adventurers who meet these conditions?\u201dTo be honest, I didn\u2019t have high expectations, so if she said no, I thought of giving up and looking for another way.If I used my influence as a Lord, I might find someone who met the criteria somehow. Or I could visit the market in this city and looked for some appropriate items.However, an unexpected reply came from the staff.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 There is only one adventurer that comes to mind, but I know he\u2019s not in this city right now.\u201d\u201cThen where is he?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I also don\u2019t know. But he often stops by the city. If you\u2019re staying here, I can send you a message once this adventurer appears here?\u201dI nodded and handed the employee a silver coin.\u201cI\u2019d appreciate it if you let me know. You can send a message to room 305 of the Teria Inn. You can tell him there\u2019s a client looking for him.\u201d\u201cOh, yes! I see!\u201dPricking her animal ears, she quickly accepted the money.For now, I decided to stay in the city a little longer and wait for the adventurer to come.Had a week passed like that?The news I had been waiting for at the inn came.\u201cHe\u2019s in the city now?\u201dThe staff who came to the front of the room nodded and said that she was a little sorry.\u201cYes, young master. I was going to come with him after telling him about you, but the person himself said that you have to come in person\u2026\u201dI smiled and left the inn room.Yes, the one who needed the service should be the one to go.I and Asher immediately followed her and moved to the tavern where there were adventurers.\u201cThat\u2019s him.\u201dShe pointed to the bearded man sitting alone at a table in the tavern\u2019s corner.I approached him.He, who was drinking beer alone, looked at me and the staff behind me, and asked with a good smile.\u201cAh, are you the one who is looking for me?\u201dI imagined he would be rude because he demanded that I came in person, but it didn\u2019t seem like that was the case.I glanced at him once and opened my mouth.\u201cAre you an adventurer who can use enchantment magic and underwater breathing magic?\u201dHe scratched the bridge of his nose and snorted.\u201cWell, yes. First, may I ask what you\u2019re going to hire me for?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to explore Gaitan Lake.\u201d\u201cAh, Gaitan Lake\u2026\u201dThe man smiled and said.\u201cDid you get any treasure map? Anyway, if you\u2019re thinking about exploring that big lake, it seemed that you know what you need.\u201dI sat in front of him.\u201cOkay, let me ask you a little more about enchantments and underwater breathing magic first.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

From the most important.\u201cIs it possible to enchant another person with underwater breathing magic?\u201dSince enchantment magic was in effect, the magic that could apply to the target were very limited.In the game, I knew that underwater breathing magic was also a magic that could be enchanted to another person, but I asked again to confirm.The man chewed the snacks and nodded.\u201cYes, it\u2019s possible.\u201d\u201cHow many people can you enchant one at a time?\u201d\u201cThe number of people is limited to one because my skills are not that high.\u201d\u201cHow long does the enchantment last?\u201d\u201cThe duration varies from person to person, but for an average person who has accumulated no magical powers, it should still last about 2 hours.\u201dHe continued;\u201cIf my magic and your temperament don\u2019t match well, or if your affinity for magic is low, the duration will be shorter than that. However, if you don\u2019t move your body violently, it\u2019s not a magic that consumes a lot of mana.\u201dIf one person was the limit, it meant that I had to leave Asher and go in alone\u2026Two hours.It was not enough time to explore the huge lake and find the mystery, but of course, it was unnecessary to find it on the first attempt, so I thought that was good enough.Even if the duration of the magic was short, I could not miss this guy because such talent could not be obtained anywhere else right away.\u201cHow long does it take to use up all of your magic power and fully recover it again?\u201d\u201cIt takes at least half a day to meditate with concentration.\u201dI pondered in my mind for a while.Considering one hour of exploration, three hours of charging, and rest, was it possible to dive roughly two or three times a day to explore the lake?Well, no matter what the efficiency was, I couldn\u2019t find such a talented person anywhere else right away, so the hiring was confirmed immediately.This man also didn\u2019t seem to have any intention of rejecting the request, so I made the offer right away.\u201cI want to hire you.\u201dHe snapped his finger at my words.\u201cIf you only pay a lot of deposits, of course I\u2019m fine. By the way, when and how long are you planning to explore the lake?\u201d\u201cThe departure is tomorrow. And there is no set period. It could be a few days or a few weeks.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Yes? Wait, that\u2019s a bit\u2026?\u201d\u201cAs you said, I\u2019ll give you a generous amount of the commission. I\u2019ll give you two gold as a start-up and a daily allowance, and five gold on the day you finish the quest.\u201dAfter a moment of hesitation, he widened his eyes at the next words.The money was a lot as usual, and the effect was outstanding, not to mention.I looked around the party and said.\u201cI pay for all the drinks you had here.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7This is a very generous offer, young master.\u201dSoon he smiled cheerfully.\u201cI\u2019m late to introduce myself, but my name is Havel, a first-class adventurer. Excuse me, but what is the young master\u2019s name?\u201d\u201cI came from a distant city. You probably won\u2019t know which family I belonged to.\u201d\u201cOh, right? Anyway, please take care of me. I will do my best to assist with the exploration so that I do not waste the commission you pay! Hahaha!\u201dAnd he immediately ordered a few more drinks.I paid a generous amount in advance and left the pub on the road.I have a lot of work from tomorrow.***The day was bright, and I met Havel at the promised place.\u201cOh, are you here?\u201dUnlike last night, he had a calmer tone of voice.Apparently, he was a little drunk when we met yesterday.We went straight to Gaitan Lake by a horse-drawn carriage.As they moved, Havel talked about himself and more. It was just a story about the past or something like that.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7So that\u2019s when I first learned the underwater breathing magic.\u201cRight.\u201dI asked him with a soulless reply.\u201cHow much do you know about the Gaitan Lake?\u201d\u201cI honestly know little about it other than that it\u2019s a dirty, big lake. There are also rumors that terrifying monster fish appear when you go deep into the depths of the lake. But, really, how big would the fish living in the lake be?\u201dI knew Gaitan Lake as one of the largest lakes on the continent.The creatures living under the surface were also terrifying.As in a fantasy world, there were terrifying monsters that could not be compared to ordinary sharks or whales.I have no intention of going deep, anyway.The mystery I was looking for was attached to the outskirts of the lake, so there was no need to go deep into the center.If there was a mystery somewhere in the middle of that big lake, I wouldn\u2019t have even dared to find it.And even if I met some monsters, there wouldn\u2019t be any problem in dealing with them, since I had already gained blood magic.I thought of the scene of the place where the mystery of space leap was hidden.Again, this was not a mystery I found myself. I just saw another user\u2019s play video, so I couldn\u2019t pinpoint its exact location.On the side of the wall on the outskirts of the lake, there were rocks like sea urchins\u2026 and there was a cave.Like the last time I found the floating veil, this time it might be a complete mess again.That thought got stronger after arriving at Gaitan Lake and seeing the lake\u2019s size in person.\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Crazy.As I gazed at the endlessly expansive water surface in front of me, I spit inwardly.It was an overwhelming size that did not differ from looking at the sea from the shore.And I needed to find a mystery hidden somewhere here.I really thought this might take a few months. Even then, I might not still be able to find it at all.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been here.\u201dHavel said as he looked around the lake.The carriage stopped near the lake, and Asher, Havel, and I walked right in front of the lake.A lush forest near the lake. This was the earthly landscape that I vaguely remember.The probability of finding the mystery was high if you searched this area.I looked around the lake for a moment and then turned to Havel.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then\u2026 if something goes wrong with your body, please tell me right away.\u201dHavel immediately unleashed his magic.Blue light gathered in his hand, and I slowly absorbed the light into my body.I felt the magic that filled my whole body. After gaining super sensory, I felt the energy such as magic much better.\u00b7\u00b7Ha.The magical effect appeared immediately.Even if I didn\u2019t breathe in or breathe out, I didn\u2019t feel stuffy at all.\u201cThis is amazing,\u201d said Havel with a slightly startled look on his face.\u201cThe young master has never used magic, but the enchantment\u2019s efficiency is considerable, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cEfficiency?\u201d\u201cI think you have a high affinity for magic. Whether its martial arts or magic, if you honed your magic properly, you\u2019ll be great.\u201dWhat, he meant I had a talent for magic?I thought it was lip service, but looking at his expression, it didn\u2019t seem like that.It didn\u2019t matter now, so I turned my attention back to the lake.Then\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Where should I begin?There\u2019s no reason to drag things out.I started taking off the clothes I was wearing one by one.It was impossible to swim in the water in these thick clothes.So I took it all off except for the thin T-shirt and pants I was wearing underneath.\u201cI\u2019ll leave it to you.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Oh, yes.\u201dWith a slightly bewildered face, Asher carefully accepted the clothes I had taken off.\u201cOh, and be careful not to move too vigorously in the water, young master.\u201dI listened to Havel\u2019s warning and sent the two back to the carriage.I was going to be in the water for a while, so they didn\u2019t have to stay it here.\u201cHmmmm\u2026\u201dAlone, I relaxed lightly and approached right in front of the surface of the water.There wasn\u2019t much pressure on diving.This was because one of the other specialties I could show off, having been immersed in games all my life, was scuba diving.Unlike me, my brother, who was very active, would take me out of the house and carry me around on holidays. Skiing or climbing.Among them, scuba diving was the one that my brother and I especially enjoyed together. Because it suited my taste.Of course, I was naked right now, but I had super regeneration and could move without getting tired, so I was not worried.Splash!I dived into the water and immediately checked my breathing again. There\u2019s no problem.The mana consumed while holding my breath was also clearly felt through my super sensory, so there was no problem here either.\u2026Havel said that the enchantment efficiency of my body was good, so that\u2019s why.I swam slowly, moving my limbs.The super sensory made the vision in front as clear as on the ground whether I didn\u2019t expect that the effect would be the same underwater.As I went deeper, fishes passed by me one by one.I stopped at a suitable point and started moving sideways, looking at the wall of the lake.From now on until I found the mystery, it was an endless struggle in this way.. . . And roughly two hours passed.I grabbed the stone beak protruding from the wall, stopped my body, and sighed inwardly.There is no end to this.I expected it, but after experiencing it myself, it felt different.I went back for once because my magic power was slowly dropping.I went back to where I marked the starting location and went up to the ground.Returning to the carriage, Asher and Baros were having a meal with Havel.\u201c\u2026Are you here, sir?\u201dSeeing my wet look, Baros briefly twitched the corners of his mouth and lowered his head.It may have been subconsciously, but I could see it very well because of my super sensory. The other obviously wanted to laugh at my current appearance.Havel asked me.\u201cDid you find what you\u2019re looking for, young master?\u201dI shook my head.\u201cI think it\u2019s going to take a lot longer than I thought.\u201dDrying myself over the campfire, I ate with them.And in the late afternoon, I went back to the lake and continued the exploration, but again, the mystery could not be found. That day\u2019s exploration was over.A week passed like that.I came to the lake early this morning, and I swam in the water in search of the mystery.However, because I still couldn\u2019t see even the tail of this mystery, doubts arose whether this could actually be done.Is it really possible to find it?If I could, I would have already used a lot of manpower for this, but I can\u2019t because I was looking for a mystery.I lay in the water for a moment, drifting blankly, meditating.If I had the certainty that I could find it, I would invest no matter how long it took, but the problem was that I wasn\u2019t sure.It was when I was thinking about whether I should postpone the search for the space leap until later\u2026\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7?\u201dI could sense a huge monster approaching quickly from afar.The next thing that appeared in sight was a gigantic shark. Almost the size of a ship.\u3010Lv. 51]\u00b7\u00b7Why did such a guy come out when I didn\u2019t even go deep into the lake?As soon as it saw me, it opened its mouth wide and rushed towards me.This bastard.I immediately tried to shoot a drop of blood using blood magic.But then, again, I sense another one approaching quickly from the other side.Blue magic energy cut through the current and hit the body of the shark that was rushing towards me.Whoops!The shark that was hit directly by the attack struggled in pain and lost consciousness.Then I felt something approaching me, grabbing my waist.\u00b7\u00b7Uh?I looked at the one who grabbed my waist.A woman with blue hair covered with scales.It seemed like she thought I was in danger and was trying to save me.I couldn\u2019t speak because I was in the water, so she caught me and dragged to the ground in an instant, knowing nothing. Why was this girl so fast?\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Whoa!\u201dThe woman who came out to the ground exhaled heavily, then looked at me as I sat blankly and shouted.\u201cHey! Are you crazy, human? Did you go so deep intending to die?!\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201d\u201cHey, I\u2019m totally blown away. You\u2019re so lucky. I was really planning to ignore you, but I still ended up saving you.\u201dShe grunted like that and started wiping away the moisture from her body.Then, the scales that had been covered with water began to slowly return to the human skin.I opened my eyes a little when I saw that.\u00b7\u00b7Seawater tribe?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Are you curious?\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201dHe\u2019s a bit of a funny guy.The scales that had sprouted on the skin almost disappeared.She was completely naked because she wasn\u2019t wearing a single piece of clothing, so I glanced away.\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Come to think of it, they weren\u2019t the kind of people who were ashamed of showing their naked body like humans.The woman glanced at me and then continued with a tongue-in-cheek tone.\u201cHow long are you going to be stunned? Aren\u2019t you going to say thank you to me for saving you from becoming fish food?\u201dI also got up and shook my head.\u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to save me.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7What?\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t even dangerous. You just did something useless.\u201dI could just say thank you and move on, but the way she spoke was annoying.\u201cWow, hah! So, that was not dangerous.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re really shameless. Is it so hard to say thank you? Did you think I\u2019d ask for anything in return for saving you, like you humans do?\u201d\u201cI was just telling the truth.\u201d\u201cOkay, that\u2019s all right. Boy, anyway, that\u2019s why human bastards are\u2026\u201dShe shook her head and turned around.I stared at her back.\u2018Do the Seawater tribe also live in Gaitan Lake?\u2019It was a fact I didn\u2019t know at all.Because it was such a rare race that I only saw it once while playing the game.And I knew that the Seawater tribe was definitely a tribe that inhabited the ocean\u2026 Why the hell were they in a lake like this?As it was an unexpected encounter, I felt a little strange, but a thought suddenly came to my mind.\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Then do they know some important information about the lake here?Could they know where the place I was looking for was?After thinking about it up to that point, I immediately called after the woman.\u201cHey, Seawater person.\u201dShe stopped walking at my call and turned her head back. She had a slightly bewildered face.\u201cWho are you? Do you know about our race?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHow?\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019ve seen it in a book. A legendary race that has a human form on the ground and scales like fish in the water.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Me, a legend?\u201dThe corners of her lips twitched.\u201cHmm, hmm. It\u2019s a legend. Is our race so famous to you humans?\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201dDid she like hearing the word \u201clegendary\u201d?I just meant that it\u2019s a race that was rarely seen.As she stared at me, she suddenly gave me a look of disappointment.\u201cOh, no? I\u2019m not a Seawater person? You\u2019re wrong, human.\u201dWhy was she acting like that suddenly?\u201cI\u2019m right.\u201d\u201cNo, sir. Don\u2019t go around saying that you saw me here, huh?\u201dShe started murmuring that she saved me for nothing.Like the vampires of Elrod Forest, I wondered if they were concerned that their home would be exposed.Still, she didn\u2019t want to kill me, but she tried to save me.\u201cSo what? Why are you calling me?\u201d she asked.I asked her.\u201cAre you aware of the rock formations in the lake? Or is there a cave?\u201dShe made a strange expression, then frowned and replied.\u201cI don\u2019t know. Why are you asking that?\u201dI didn\u2019t miss that subtle change.After gaining extra sensory, I could read other people\u2019s facial expressions better, but she especially could not hide her emotions.So I was half sure. That she knew the place I just said.\u201cYou know.\u201dAs I spoke again, I saw her flinch. So, she really knew about it.\u201cPlease. I want you to guide me there.\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cIf there is anything you want, I will repay you in the best possible way.\u201dShe snorted and turned back.\u201cWell, don\u2019t hold on to me with useless words. If you chase me, I\u2019ll throw you back into the lake, so don\u2019t chase after me.\u201dThen she ran and disappeared into the forest in an instant.I brushed my hair once more and stared at the forest.I wasn\u2019t worried about losing her.It seemed that they settled here by the lake, anyway.How should I coax that?I\u2019d go back and try again later.***After returning to the carriage, drying myself and eating, I immediately took Asher back to the place where I had met the woman.I followed the trail she left.Footprints on the floor, tread marks, etc., were enough to figure out where she was headed.There were traces that would be difficult to find normally, but it wasn\u2019t too difficult to notice with super sensory. It was also very useful for tracking.The place we reached after chasing the trail was a cave located deep in the forest.I saw two men standing at the entrance of the cave, chatting.They looked like they were standing guard, and when they saw us, they stiffened their faces.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Humans?\u201dIt seemed to be the right place.One hurried into the cave, and the other shouted at us as we approached the cave.\u201cStop, human!\u201dI quietly stopped.I felt others coming from inside, so I waited quietly.Soon, dozens of Seawater tribe people came out of the cave. Fortunately, this time they were all wearing clothes, so there was no need for me to look elsewhere.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Hey you!\u201dOne of them, a woman with a familiar face, saw me and pointed a finger at me and shouted.\u201cHow did you know we\u2019re here?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I even saved you\u2026!\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, Anne? You saved a human?\u201dThe eyes of others who were looking at me with tense eyes shifted to her.\u201cUh, no, that\u2019s not it\u2026\u201dShe panicked and waved her hands.The noise was getting louder and louder, but we heard a sound from inside the cave.\u201cEveryone, be quiet!\u201dSuddenly, silence fell upon them.The man walking out of the cave was an old man with a strong build. With blue hair and a beard.An old man who passed the others and walked forward met my eyes.\u3010Lv. 87]\u00b7\u00b7Close to 90 level.Is he the chieftain of this tribe?Although the Seawater tribe was born with a fairly strong affinity for magical powers, that was already a very high level, even if one considered that.I hid my surprise inside and exchanged glances quietly. The old man\u2019s eyes were as deep as the sea.The old man who was staring at me immediately burst out laughing and opened his mouth.\u201cHeh heh, this is true. I guess you\u2019re not a normal person.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201d\u201cTell me why you came here. It looks like you\u2019ve already had a small encounter with my granddaughter.\u201dThe old man glanced at the woman.She let out a small sigh and scratched her head.I looked at the two and asked.\u201cAre you the chieftain of this tribe, Sir?\u201dWhen I said that, I felt awkward.Because it was the first honorific word I used after possessing this body.But, now, I had something to ask, and I was the one who came here suddenly, so I had to be polite.The old man nodded at my question.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cI have no intention of harming you. I\u2019m just here to ask that woman a favor.\u201dShe caught my gaze and tried to shout again with an angry face.\u201cHey, I already told you I don\u2019t know!\u201d\u201cStop it, Anne.\u201dThe chieftain stopped her and spoke to me again.\u201cWould you like to come in first? If you want a conversation, I\u2019ll offer you a cup of tea.\u201dI nodded.The old man smiled and turned back into the cave as if gesturing to follow him.I looked at his back and furrowed my brow.\u2026A wound.Because it looked like he had a pretty big scar on his back.The wounds were being treated, and herb-like grasses were glued together.\u201cHey, if you\u2019re coming in, come in quickly.\u201dThe woman, who was looking at me with a dissatisfied gaze, pointed with her chin.Well, luckily, it seemed like they were going to treat me like a guest, so let\u2019s go inside.***As we entered the innermost part of the cave, a simple space appeared.There was grass on the seat, and around the bonfire, things like fish bones were gathered and scattered.\u201cJust take a suitable seat and sit down.\u201dAs Asher and I hesitated about where to sit, the chieftain said that.So, as he said, we just sat down randomly.The Seawater person, who gave tea to the chieftain first and set down the teacup in front of me, glared at me before leaving.The chief clenched his tongue and raised the teacup.\u201cPlease understand. Because of what happened recently, everyone has a lot of hostility towards humans.\u201dThe woman, who was crouching in the corner and looking at me as well, said.\u201cI hated humans from the beginning, Grandpa.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s noisy, girl.\u201d\u201cNo, look at that brazen thing. I was the one who saved him from being fish food earlier. But even though I told him not to follow me, he kept chasing me all the way here. Without knowing grace.\u201dThe chief tilted his head at her and asked, as if he did not understand.\u201cYou said you saved that man?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d\u201cDid you really get help from my granddaughter?\u201dHe looked away and asked me again.I shook my head.\u201cIt was just a pointless meddle.\u201d\u201cWell, then.\u201d\u201cNo, wow! What a shameless\u2026!\u201dThe old man ignored it and continued.\u201cMy granddaughter seems to have misunderstood something, so please ignore it. Although she has a rough mouth, she has a good heart, so it\u2019s probably not something she did with bad intentions.\u201dHow much did this old man know about me?I nodded my head as I looked at the woman screaming with a face about to die from unfairness.\u201cAnyway, I have a favor to ask of your granddaughter\u2026\u201d\u201cHey, are you going to ask me to show you the place you asked me about earlier?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dShe said, sticking her tongue out.\u201cI will tell nothing to a brazen bastard like you.\u201d\u201cThank you so much for saving me earlier. I\u2019m late to thank you.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Do you think I\u2019m a fool?! I will never tell you, so fuck it!\u201dIt\u2019s not that simple.I shook my head and turned my gaze back to the chieftain.Mystery was a mystery, but I also had a question for him.\u201cBy the way, I knew that the Seawater people lived on the seashore, but have you been living in this lake from the beginning?\u201dAt that question, their faces darkened slightly in an instant.The chieftain shook his head.\u201cNo. Right now, we\u2019re just staying for a while.\u201dI intuitively seemed to know what the situation was.\u201cIs it because of the wound on the back?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s been quite a while, but recovery is slow, so it\u2019s still like this.\u201d\u201cCan I ask how it happened?\u201dConsidering his level, he wasn\u2019t weak enough to be attacked by anyone.The chieftain replied with a bitter smile.\u201cI had a conflict with a human like you.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s a human\u2026.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a powerful mage. He called himself the chief mage of the Imperial Family of Santea.\u201d\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7What?A completely unexpected person popped out, so my eyes widened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Just like how they hunted the White Moon tribe of Asher.It was the emperor\u2019s twisted beliefs, and it was a setting that occupied a fairly large part in RaSa\u2019s main story.And if it\u2019s the Seawater tribe, obviously\u2026One setting about the Seawater people also came to mind.The reason they were a special race was that it was very difficult to see them, but there was one more reason.Magic Crystal.Perhaps it was called by that name.It was said that when the Seawater people almost reached their set lifespan and died, they create a \u2018Magic Crystal\u2019 just before they died.It was like the inner core of a spirit beast in any martial arts novel.Magic crystal had an extremely high purity compared to ordinary mana stones, for mages, they were nothing less than heavenly treasures.Then you can understand roughly.I wanted to ask more details, but I decided not to mention the magic crystal.That would be a very sensitive issue for them as well, so it would be bad if I mentioned it since I was an outsider.\u201cHow did you come across such a person?\u201dTo my question, the chieftain drank tea and answered.\u201cWe met him on our way back to our hometown in the sea.\u201d\u201cDid he attack your tribe for no reason?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that\u2026 it\u2019s just the result of greed. There were various circumstances.\u201dIt didn\u2019t seem like he was going to explain any more by saying that with a smirk.The result of greed.Again, I was convinced that my guess about the magic crystal was correct.The woman who had been listening to the conversation with dissatisfied eyes intervened.\u201cWhat is Grandpa saying so uselessly? What if he goes around and talks about it to other humans?\u201d\u201cTsk, did the person who cares about that saved a human and even brought him all the way here?\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7No, when did I bring him here! He was just chasing after me!\u201dI wanted to tease her that she should not have meddled in the first place, but I resisted.It\u2019s a pity that I needed her to be on my side, so there was nothing good about getting on her nerves.The chieftain stroked his beard and continued.\u201cAnyway, that\u2019s why I got hurt like this. All the members of the tribes escaped into the water and barely saved their lives.\u201dI could imagine how the situation at that time must be.The chieftain came forward to buy time for other members of the tribe to escape, but eventually got attacked.If his enemy was the mage of the Santea Imperial Family, he had to be at his level to compete with him at all.\u201cWell, I have little time left anyway, so I\u2019m glad that all the members of the tribe survived\u2026\u201d\u201cGrandpa!\u201dSuddenly, the woman screamed and glared at the chieftain.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I told you not to talk like that!\u201d\u201cChild, don\u2019t shout, it\u2019s painful in the ears.\u201dThe chieftain simply drank his tea.An awkward silence fell for a moment.I felt the warmth in my hands as I fiddled with the teacup, then opened my mouth again.\u201cThe wounds appear to be very serious.\u201d\u201cHonestly, yes. There is no sign of getting better.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know how much it will help, but I have one remedy.\u201dAt that, the woman looked at me in amazement.\u201cRe, a remedy?\u201dThe chieftain also opened his eyes and asked me.\u201cIf it\u2019s a remedy\u2026 are you talking about a healing potion?\u201d\u201cExactly.\u201dSo, they\u2019re familiar with it.Because they lived in the wild, I thought they would not know about potions, so it was a surprise.I immediately took out Scarlet, which I always carry in my arms.I had used it quite a bit so far, so I had less than half left, but it\u2019s a good enough amount.I said while looking at the woman whose eyes were completely fixed on the potion.\u201cThis is the best potion among the potions floating around in the world.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201d\u201cIf you tell me where the place I\u2019m looking for is, I\u2019ll give it to you.\u201dI seek a place of mystery, and the chieftain has his wounds healed.It was a suggestion that benefit everyone.\u201cHow can we believe in what humans give\u2026\u201dAfter muttering like that, she shut her mouth again, glanced at the chieftain, and changed her words quickly.\u201cOh, no. I\u2019ll believe it, so give it to me.\u201d\u201cCan you tell me where the place is?\u201d\u201cYeah! I\u2019ll tell you, so hurry!\u201dIt was a desperate cry.It was a more intense reaction than I had expected, so I continued to speak, even though I was a little perplexed.\u201cThen make a promise.\u201d\u201cWhat else?!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know how effective this potion will be for the chieftain\u2019s wounds. So even if the effect is minimal, you must still guide me to that place.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I will guide you to places like that 100 more times.\u201dOriginally, I was going to hand over the potion after being guided to the location, but I changed my mind.The order didn\u2019t really matter even if it\u2019s possible that she could change her mind later.Well, I hope that\u2019s not the case.I handed her Scarlet.After accepting it, she stood still and looked at the chieftain.He gestured\u201cGive it to me.\u201dThe chieftain opened the potion bottle and glanced at the contents.Then he looked surprised and nodded.\u201cSeeing that the scent of magical power is so strong, it\u2019s definitely not an ordinary thing. Can I really accept this?\u201d\u201cI get something in return, so I didn\u2019t just give it for nothing.\u201d\u201cWell, I guess the place you\u2019re looking for is quite important to you. Anyway, I\u2019ll put it to good use.\u201dThe woman snatched the potion from him again.\u201cShow me your back, Grandpa. I\u2019ll treat you right now.\u201d\u201cDo you know how to use it?\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Well, can\u2019t it just be poured into the wound?\u201dShe turned to look at me.\u201cJust let me do it.\u201dHowever, having used it a few times, I know how to use it better.After laying the chieftain on his seat, I examined the wounds on his back.The wound was torn at an oblique line, and there were black marks around it. The color was like that of a bruise, but the severity was incomparable to it.Crooked.I poured the potion little by little from top to bottom along the wounded area.Contrary to expectations, the effect appeared shortly after.It was a little slow, but the wounds slowly healed.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Ah!\u201dThe woman who was watching the scene, restless next to him, let out a sigh.When the wounds disappeared without a trace, the chief rose again. And he looked at me with bewildered eyes.I asked him.\u201cHow are you?\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7There are still some wounds left, but the trauma seems to have completely healed. This is a really great thing.\u201dI nodded and gave him all the potions I had left.\u201cDrink all that\u2019s left. Those wounds will recover to some extent.\u201dThe chief drank all the remaining potions at once and set the empty bottle on the floor.Then, with a much more lively face than before, he smiled and looked back at the woman.\u201cChild, what are you crying about?\u201dAs he said, the woman\u2019s eyes were red as if she was about to cry.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Are all better, Grandpa?\u201cYeah. Now we can head to the sea again. Without exception, everyone.\u201d\u201cUhhh!\u201dShe rushed into the chieftain\u2019s arms and hugged him, and burst out crying like a child.The chief patted her on the head.As I didn\u2019t know the details of what had happened to them, I just sat still and watched the scene awkwardly.***After exiting the cave, we returned to the carriage.After receiving the underwater breathing magic enchantment, I headed straight to the designated place by myself.After sitting with my back against a tree and waiting for a while, a woman appeared from within the forest.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7What you looking at?\u201dThe corners of her eyes were still red, so when I looked up, the blunt words returned.I shook my head and got up from my seat.\u201cLet\u2019s right away.\u201dThe woman threw down her clothes and walked towards the lake. I followed her too.Now it was time to go find the mystery of space leap.She, who had been staring at the water surface, glanced at me and asked.\u201cBut you\u2019re human. You can\u2019t stay in the water for long, can you?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter because I had someone put magic on me.\u201d\u201cOh yeah\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201dShe hesitated as if she had something else to say, then said in a crawling voice.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7?\u201d\u201cThank you, for treating my grandfather. Thank you so much.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dI answered briefly.There was nothing she had to say thank you for since I got something back for it.As she spoke, she wiped her face with a sullen look, then stuttered and shouted.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7It\u2019s fine? I\u2019m just saying thank you! Because I\u2019m not as brazen as you!\u201dWas she thanking me or asking for a fight?I sighed and said.\u201cBefore we go in, tell me about the place I\u2019m looking for. Somewhere in the lake.\u201dShe glanced around the lake, pointed in one direction, and said:\u201cSee over there? You have to go over there and go down to the point where you can almost see the bottom. It\u2019s pretty deep.\u201dI also looked where she was pointing and nodded my head.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There are only a few, I can handle them easily. You just have to trust me and follow me.\u201dShe said smirking.I looked at the level above her head.39 wasn\u2019t a level where one could be so confident, but\u2026As she continued to speak, she asked as if she was curious.\u201cBut why are you looking for that place? Are there any hidden treasures?\u201dShe must be thinking of gold and silver treasures.There was a hidden treasure that couldn\u2019t be compared with anything like that.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cAha, I see. Are you trying to find a treasure ship? I\u2019ve seen a lot of people like that when I was living at the beach\u2026 Wait, but this is a lake. You\u2019re not doing anything stupid to find a treasure ship in the lake, are you?\u201d\u201cStop talking and guide me now.\u201dAt that, she snorted and jumped right into the water. I followed and jumped in.Splash!Seeing her in the water, she instantly changed into a figure covered with scales.I looked closely and I couldn\u2019t see any gills under her ears. It\u2019s interesting.As if she was telling me to follow her, she swam first, waving her fingers and moving.She\u2019s too fast.I worked hard to pursue her, but of course I had no choice but to fall behind.How can I, as a human being, caught up with a race that lives in water?She shouted when she saw that I was lagging behind. Even though she was underwater, her voice was clearly pierced in my ears.\u2013 Why are you so slow! come fast! Do you want me to leave you alone?!Were the Seawater people capable of raising their voices underwater?Anyway, while saying that, she started moving slowly at the same pace as me.As we got to a fairly deep place, big fish appeared and passed by.\u2013 It\u2019s okay, these aren\u2019t the kind that attack first\u2026The expression on her complexion, who had been speaking with ease, hardened for a moment.Something huge was approaching fast from below.A monster with black scales that look hard like armor, and thorns pointed forward like a lance.Damn.I also looked at it and frowned.It was the charging fish she mentioned before going into the water. We were really encountering this now.\u2013 Be careful!Whoops!She flew in as if she was shooting at the guy who was charging towards this side and smashed it with her fists.Even in the water, it was as fast as running on the ground.A charging fish that had been properly hit in the body spit out blood and sank down the shaft.Unlike her, who was relieved, I looked around.This was because they were much more likely to travel in groups than as single individuals.I could feel a huge amount of presence starting to gather around me.\u2013 Huh, huh?She also looked around with a puzzled face.The charging fish that flocked in an instant surrounded us and spun around like a tornado.The number gradually increased and soon passed hundreds. It was like a black wave.I watched the scene as if tired.This was the way they hunted.They surrounded their prey and spun around to prevent it from escaping, and they stabbed from all directions at once.After all, it was a hunting method that could be done because they did not get hurt because of their hard scales.\u2013 Me, get your mind right.A trembling voice was heard.Looking to the side, she was completely in panic.Now who was going to save whom?\u2013 Hold my waist. I\u2019ll try to pierce the top somehow\u2026\u2013 What are you doing just floating there, hurry up\u2026!I smiled, ignoring her words, and placed my hand over my head.The blood that oozes out of my palms was lumped together in the form of a sphere.She was about to shout again, but stopped when she saw blood cells floating on the palm of my hand.Shall we properly test my blood magic?As a swarm of charging fish spinning around us rushed towards us, blood cells exploded like a bomb.Whoops!Drops of blood that burst out in all directions broke through the current and shot at them.And that was the end of it.The black waves that rushed in like a suffocation lost their strength and sank to the bottom of the water. It was annihilation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What and how\u2026 Is there any poison in your blood?As she said that, she fluttered in horror at the blood mixed with the water and floating around.\u2013 Whoa, whoa!Soon after realizing that there was nothing wrong with her, she asked again, bewildered.\u2013 I\u2019m fine, right? Huh? I will not die, am I?I nodded. It\u2019s not poison.Then she became relieved.\u2013 But what kind of magic did you use? You didn\u2019t say you had that kind of ability.Why did I have to tell you that?I pointed my finger at the bottom to tell her to keep moving.She nodded and swam forward again.I could hear a small mumble in my ear.-\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Then, it\u2019s not really dangerous back then. Was it just my meddling? Aww, it\u2019s embarrassing\u2026I could see a few more monstrous fishes appearing suddenly, gulping down the pouring charging fish carcasses. They ate well today.I passed them and followed her down into the depths.How far down?Gradually, we entered the depths from which hardly any light could enter.I had never been so far out of the ground and never dived so deep when exploring on my own.Still, there was no problem with vision because of the super sensory, but the pressure on the body was the problem.But even if there was a problem in one or two places, I believe that super regeneration would fix it on its own\u2026She still showed no sign of stopping.Slowly, when it felt like the limit, I could see a visible land.It was not the bottom of the lake, but a naturally made terrain.\u2026!And the sharp rocks that stretch out like stalagmites around them.Some of them curved sideways, making them look like bamboo shoots or huge teeth. It was a strange sight.I stopped and leaned against the wall.She got down to the floor first and pointed to the rocks as if she had arrived.\u2013 Is this what you said? Speaking of sharp rocks, this is the only place that comes to mind.Probably right.I remembered that the place I saw in the play video definitely felt like this.I didn\u2019t think there would ever be another such unusual natural topography.Then there must be a cave nearby\u2026That was where the mystery of space leap was hidden.I signaled her.I mouthed the word \u2018cave\u2019. She shrugged her shoulders as if she understood right away.\u2013 Cave? I don\u2019t know. But if you look for it, it looks like it\u2019s there.As she said, the area where the pointed rocks were spread out was very wide and uneven, so it was enough to find a hidden entrance if you looked for it.I scattered and tried to send a hand signal to find out.If she found the cave first, she could go inside and discover the mystery.So, he opened his palm to signify that she should wait patiently in this place.\u2013 What? Am I waiting here?I nodded.\u2013 Why? Aren\u2019t you trying to find the entrance to the cave? I can help too\u2026I shook my head violently.\u00a0I\u2019m begging you, just be still.She nodded her head reluctantly. She even muttered a little.\u2013 I have no interest in treasure, but you still think I will covet it. After all, human greed is\u2026It seemed like she misunderstood something, but it didn\u2019t really matter, so I left her.I moved around and started looking around the rocky area.I remembered it was a small entrance that barely even one person could fit in.I was looking at everything from the flat side, then turning to the side and looking at the part that was sloping down quickly.Wow!\u00b7\u00b7Found.I looked into the entrance, which was exquisitely hidden among the rocks with joy.Without a single thought, I put the glowstone tied around my waist in my mouth and slowly pushed my body inside.It was quite difficult to get in because the passage was narrow, but not impossible. Still, it was much easier with water.How far did I move by picking up and pulling on the wall with my outstretched arms alternately?As I went further in, the passage became wider and wider, to where I could move my limbs completely freely.At about that time, a small passage appeared, not in the front, but in the side. It was about the size of the entrance where I came in earlier.\u00b7\u00b7?I stopped because I thought it was a fork in the road, and immediately opened the floating veil.A gigantic snake protruding from the hole like hit the veil with its wide-open jaws.\u3010Lv. 35]It wasn\u2019t a fork in the road; it was this water snake\u2019s nest. No, was it its hunting ground?The snake that collided with the veil lost its mind in shock and squirmed backwards.I shot a drop of blood at it, and it immediately stopped breathing. Was that snake just planning to make a surprise attack?I continued on the way I was going.If I kept going inside, wouldn\u2019t a monster worse than that one just pop out? For a moment, I had that thought.But it was irrelevant. It was easy to kill, no matter how big a bastard popped out.There was nothing I could do on my own before. But even though my physical abilities were still poor, I became a lot stronger now.The passage bend along the way and continued upwards for a while.And when I got to the end, it wasn\u2019t the monster that appeared; it was the one I had been looking for for a week in this lake.A small space the size of a room.On the floor in the middle, a mysterious pattern was shining brightly in purple.I smiled and swam towards the pattern.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
