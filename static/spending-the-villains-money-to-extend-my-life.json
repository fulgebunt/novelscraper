BUZZ!It vibrated two more consecutive times and finally Gu Shishi was woken up from her deep, pitch-black sleep.She opened up her eyes groggily. The room was pitch black except for a sliver of light shining in through a crack in front of her.Gu Shishi rotated her sore neck a little bit and slightly moved her legs that were still crossed.Did she dozed off while she was reading again?Picking up her cell phone that was next to her thigh, she squinted her eyes and looked at the screen.After the strong light from the screen hit her eyes, her face darkened.She was still alive?She distinctly remembered dying in a multiple-car accident.Recalling the gruesome scene from the accident, painful memories flooded back to her, she turned pale and broke up into a cold sweat.While she frowned and sorted out her memories, her cell phone buzzed a couple more times.[Young Master Cheng is on his way up!]Gu Shishi paused for a second.Who was that?And what were they talking about?Before she could figure out what was going on, she felt a cold breeze on her. She looked down at herself. Under the dim light of the screen, she saw that the only thing she had on was a spaghetti-strap chemise.She was stunned. A slight movement of her arm, and she hit the wooden board in front of her!It made a small banging noise and she was even more confused.\u201cWhat\u2026 is this? A closet?\u201dGu Shishi felt up and down, then left and right around herself. This was getting more bizarre.She was sitting inside a small and narrow wooden chest and on both sides of her were rows and rows of man\u2019s suits.Which was to say that right now she was sitting inside a man\u2019s closet with its doors closed.She was just about to open up the closet door when she suddenly heard a man\u2019s voice from outside the room.Gu Shishi froze in mid-action.The next moment, with a creaking sound, the room door outside of the closet was opened.\u201cMmm, Shuangshuang, I need to talk to my brother about something and I will be downstairs shortly,\u201d came a male voice that was gentle like jade.Gu Shishi\u2019s groggy brain finally had it all strung together from that line.Young Master Cheng\u2026. Brother\u2026. Shuangshuang\u2026.. closet\u2026..BOOM! And all the memories flooded her brain.That was the clich\u00e9 novel that she was reading in the taxi.Gu Shishi, the cannon fodder in the story, was born into wealth, but was accidentally switched at birth with the fake young mistress Gu Wushuang, the daughter of a peasant family.The Gu\u2019s and the Huo\u2019s were to form an alliance through marriage and the Gu\u2019s didn\u2019t want the fake young mistress with heart disease to live a hard life. So, after a few days of Gu Shishi returning to the Gu\u2019s, it was decided that she was to marry the boss villain Huo Sishen, the very unfortunate, lonely, wife-cursing First Young Master of the Gu\u2019s.Further, she was sent to live in Huo Sishen\u2019s mansion after the engagement ceremony.The one she was fond of, however, was the Huo\u2019s second young master Huo Wencheng.Abruptly, Gu Shishi reached up and covered her face with her palms.No way! Did she really transmigrated to become the female supporting character who has the same name as her?\u201cGe, you asked me to come over to discuss the Gu\u2019s, but where are you?\u201d Again came Huo Wencheng\u2019s gentle voice from the other side of the closet.(T/N:Ge \u2013how one addresses one\u2019s older brother.)Gu Shishi opened her mouth.As the story would go, the female support character really wanted to become a couple with Huo Wencheng, which was why she bribed the servant to help trick Huo Wencheng into the room when he came to visit while she hid in the closet and jump into his arms when the time was right.How in the hell did she end up transmigrated into such a clich\u00e9 novel?What could she do?She definitely couldn\u2019t go out right now, but\u2026.Gu Shishi touched her spaghetti strap on herself and was a bit lost. Should she get out after Huo Wencheng was gone?\u201cGe? Was that you in the bathroom?\u201dShe then heard the rustling sound of the shower curtain being pulled open.The sound of Huo Wencheng\u2019s footsteps continued throughout the room; obviously, he was still looking for the missing person.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

He, on the other hand, wasn\u2019t interested in her at all. Worst so, he was a vicious one \u2013 he had the servant waited outside the room and go get Huo Sishen as soon as Gu Shishi jumped out.Which was how her fianc\u00e9 was right there when she professed her love for his brother. And, the servant who pretended to be serving tea also witnessed the scene. Her poor reputation spread among the upper class overnight.The cannon fodder female support character\u2019s engagement was called off, and she was booted out of the Gu\u2019s and she ended up killing herself at the start of the story.So\u2026. She became the cannon fodder who didn\u2019t make it through three days?!\u201cGe? Are you not in the room?\u201d Huo Wencheng\u2019s voice was getting closer. He was slowly but steadily getting closer and closer to where the closet was.With a softer voice, Huo Wencheng suddenly switched to calling out for her, \u201cMiss Gu?\u201dGu Shishi felt goosebumps instantly.She held her breath right away and didn\u2019t dare to move a muscle. She worried that any small noise from her would give away her whereabouts.As soon as he opened up the closet doors, she would come face to face with this asshole hidden under the appearance of a morally upstanding man!How would she explain why she was hiding inside the closet?STEP! STEP!Huo Wencheng stopped in front of the largest closet in the room within a fraction of a second.With only the closet door between the two of them, Gu Shishi thought she could even heard the steady breathing sound coming from him.The distance between the two was less than the span of an arm.Gu Shishi\u2019s heart was about to stop.She lifted her head.Through the very narrow crack between the closet doors, the light that seemed to have come from outside the window flicked quickly and a shadow casted down on her.Huo Wencheng\u2019s hand was on top of the handle of the closet door!With a slight creaking noise, the door opened up a little bit.The stream of light widened by two folds!She clutched her chest. Pale and ready to accept her fate, she closed her eyes. Suddenly, she then heard a cold and impatient voice, \u201cWhat are you doing in my room?\u201dContrary to the tender voice of Huo Wencheng, this coarse voice immediately gave people the creeps, and a feeling of impending danger that should not be taken lightly.Every single hair on Gu Shishi\u2019s skin stood up. Was she so nervous earlier that she missed his footstep?This was the original owner\u2019s fianc\u00e9, Huo Sishen?She never jumped out of the closet, so theoretically the maid never reported her to him,, so would the storyline continue on like it should?She gasped.The tragic ending of the original owner made her body freezer, and all her blood rushed into her brain!\u201cGe\u2026.\u201dAs though he was shocked by electricity, Huo Wencheng immediately pulled his hand back from the closet door.Gu Shishi\u2019s heart was about to bounce out of her throat. She worried that he would tell on her.\u201cGe, I heard that you were looking for me,\u201d explained Huo Wencheng quickly.\u201cThat was not true.\u201dThe voice was still cold and the impatience in the voice more so than before, \u201cGet out.\u201d\u201cGe, I\u2026.\u201d\u201cGet out, and send people in to disinfect.\u201dWhatever Huo Wencheng was going to say, he swallowed the rest of his words.Gu Shishi listened as attentively as she could and finally heard footsteps getting farther and farther away. She gathered that Huo Wencheng was finally gone and let out a big sigh.Her possibly wife-cursing fianc\u00e9e was a severe germaphobe and that had just worked to her advantage.The disinfecting team probably wouldn\u2019t pull open the closet door right away? She should be safe then.But, right before she could relax herself, her left eye started twitching like mad.(T/N: It\u2019s a bad omen when your left eye twitches.)Immediately she squatted there motionlessly like a quail.Sure enough, almost a whole minute had passed before she heard noises from inside the room again. She could smell cologne, the scent of sandalwood, in her nose.Her legs, which had been crossed this entire time, were already starting to get numb, yet she still didn\u2019t dare to move a muscle.Her instant fianc\u00e9 seemed to have stopped right in front of the closet, like he was observing the closet?He was still here?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It seemed like he\u2019d be here for a while.Gu Shishi bit down on her lips. She had no choice but to continue to kneel inside the closet and tried to remember more about this man.In the story, Huo Sishen seemed to have cursed his father and his grandfather to death.(T/N: \u201cCurse\u201d in this context was not that he voluntarily putting a spell on anyway, but that his \u201cluck\u201d was so bad that people die around him. Same meaning when referencing to him cursing his wives earlier in the story.)He had been treated like a virus and isolated by his birth mother since he was a child. He was a cold and proud individual whose personal net worth had well exceeded that of the entire Huo\u2019s Corporation a long time ago.In the novel, his only role was to facilitate the relationship between the male and female leads. It wasn\u2019t a big role, and he also died quite early on.Gu Shishi wrapped her arms around her knees. She, too, was someone who was supposed to die\u2026.While she was thinking, Gu Shishi carefully remove a man\u2019s jacket from the hanger under the cover of the sound of pages being turned and put it over her own shoulder that was getting cold.And, what should her next move be?Gu Shishi bit down on her lips and clenched her fists. To live!Now that she was able to have a second chance in life, she would do anything within her power to stay alive for as long as she could!Death was too painful. It made her shudder just from thinking about it. She didn\u2019t want to experience that again casually.Gu Shishi made up her mind from inside the closet.Yet, from the stuffiness of the closet, the lack of food, and from being tense the entire time, she started passing out shortly thereafter\u2026***The sun was starting to set, and the room was getting dark quickly.\u201cYoung Master, we will take off now.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201dA coarse voice and a simple but powerful response.Huo Sishen waved his hand and dismissed the butler and the maid that was following behind him.His cold, dark eyes swept passed the guest room at the end of the hallway, and a sliver of impatience flashed through his eyes. Another fianc\u00e9e that was pushed onto him; did these people really think he has unlimited patience?\u201cThrow that woman out tomorrow!\u201d\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d Neither the butler nor the maids dare to argue with him. All they could do was to lower their heads and bowed.After he had taken a cold bath and wrapped a towel around himself, Huo Sishen walked in front of the closet and opened its doors.When the doors were just half opened, a big ball with a hint of sweet fruit fragrance rolled out with a loud noise and fell right into his chest!Huo Sishen reflexively reached out to block this object that was coming at him. When he pushed forward, what he felt was a girl as soft as snow. His face darkened and his action froze!He looked down and saw a girl with black hair down to her waist, a small face elegant like in a painting, wrapped up in one of his custom suits.His clothes were so much bigger and darker than her delicate body that, when wrapped around her, made her look even more petite and white.Gu Shishi\u2019s red lips were opened slightly. She was dreaming about happy days when she was counting money and she thought she was sleeping with a big, yellow dog in her chest. Happily, she reached out to pat the dog\u2019s fuzzy head and drooled.Huo Sishen, about to explode and with his eyes filled with the calmness before the storm, didn\u2019t expect to be patted by that small hand of hers. Immediately, he froze.Gu Shishi, on the other hand, was jerked awake from the fall. She focused her limpid eyes and saw the close up of the cold man\u2019s handsome face.At this very moment, she heard an electrical chime:[Orange alert!][Life remaining: 9 minutes and 1 second!]Gu Shishi: \u201c!?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Huh?She blinked and started looking downward.It seemed the man had just finished showering. The handsome man\u2019s wet black hair was glistening with water droplets that were still slowly dripping down\u2026This man was quite an eye candy. So this was Huo Sishen, the original owner\u2019s fianc\u00e9?Before her thoughts could go any more south, her chin was clamped tightly by fingers the very next second!The forceful and long fingers quickly traveled down, and finally, viciously wrapped around her neck!\u201cAre you done looking?\u201d There were fires in Huo Sishen\u2019s quiet and chilled eyes. He reached out and had his hands around the idiotic woman\u2019s neck.Her windpipe was blocked, and she immediately frowned in pain. This body, just like her original one, was unusually sensitive to pain!Now that she was having trouble breathing, it brought back her memories of the car accident clearly\u2026. The pain of her ribs puncturing her lungs and the pain of desperation\u2026 fear made her shiver uncontrollably![Orange alert!][Life remaining: 8 minutes 56 seconds.][Life remaining: 8 minutes 43 seconds\u2026. 7 minutes 57 seconds\u2026 7 minutes\u2026.][When the balance reaches zero, you will die in an accident.]Gu Shishi\u2019s face turned pale. Her body was covered in cold sweat and goosebumps!Struggle could be seen clearly in her limpid eyes.She didn\u2019t want to die!Help!Huo Sishen tightened his grip and lifted her up like she was a little chicken.\u201cWho said you can come inside my room?\u201dBANG! Gu Shishi was tossed into a pile of clothes.This was when Huo Sishen was able to see clearly the condition of his closet.Half of his suits and shirts that were hung and organized by events, colors, etc. had fallen onto the bottom of the closet. They were crumpled up like pickled vegetables and the woman was sitting right on them!Immediately, his face darkened completely.A screen suddenly appeared in front of the still shivering Gu Shishi.[Current Level: LV0 \u2013 The Upper Class Fianc\u00e9e on the Brink of Death (About to die in an accident).][Recharge to extend your life.][Method of Recharging: Receive Money or Valuables from Wealthy Husband.][Note: 24 hours additional life for every $1,000.][Life Remaining: 6 minutes 33 seconds.]Gu Shishi\u2019s mouth dropped open$1000 for one day of life?She looked at the violent man who was on the brink of choking her to death in disbelief.On the other hand, her remaining life flashing on the screen in front of her continue to decline.Before long, the beeping orange alert had turned into red alert!Gu Shishi felt a tightness in her chest as though she was going to die of heart disease in the next second.The gloominess in Huo Sishen\u2019s eyes seemed to have materialized, \u201cWho? Who told you to hide in my closet?\u201dGu Shishi struggled to breath in every bit of fresh air.She could live if she did what the system told her? She could live if she groveled.\u201cSo you don\u2019t want to tell me, huh?\u201dHuo Sishen snickered, turned, and walked over to the couch. He picked up the phone.\u201cSiyi, call the cops.

In the very next second, the entire phone was tossed into the trash can!Gu Shishi\u2019s back was drenched from sweat.Blushing, she said in a very low voice, \u201cUm\u2026I\u2026 I was sleepwalking\u2026.\u201dHuo Sishen scoffed, \u201cOh, and now you are awake?\u201dGu Shishi felt goosebumps on the back of her neck, \u201cWell, no\u2026\u201dHuo Sishen\u2019s face darkened.Before he could talk, urgent footsteps came toward the room.\u201cYoung Master, what just\u2026\u201dThe next second, the door was barged opened from the outside.Once the door was opened, everyone inside and outside all stiffened.Gu Shishi, with only a man\u2019s suit on her, mindlessly grabbed the biggest item in front of her \u2013 Huo Sishen \u2013 and tried to hide behind him!Huo Sishen\u2019s face was pitch black after the grab. He tossed over the blanket that was on top of the couch and covered up her white shoulder.Standing at the entrance of the room, all of Siyi\u2019s hair stood up as well. From where he was standing, all he could see was a woman with hair down to her waist, and the young master hugging each other.He was immediately confused. And, the next second, he left with great urgency.Gu Shishi immediately let out a sigh of relief.In the novel, Huo Sishen was said to be a twisted and cruel person. But, he blocked her body for her earlier; he didn\u2019t seem to be as bad as he was portrayed in the book.In fact, he seemed to be quite nice.But, before she could say that, she was picked up by the man crassly. The door was kicked open, and she was tossed onto the hallway floor!\u201cHave someone come and change out the sheets and disinfect!\u201dBANG! The door was slammed shut after that and almost smacked Gu Shishi on her nose.She rubbed her numbed bottom. Turning around, she met the eyes of the still dumbfounded Siyi, and she waved her hand awkwardly, \u201cHi~\u201dSiyi, \u201c\u2026.. Miss Gu.\u201dWhen the young master called, he thought someone had broken into the house\u2026. But, it was just young master\u2019s fianc\u00e9e trying to seduce him?\u201cI think you should go back to your own room.\u201dGu Shishi smiled bitterly, the display was telling her that she only has 4 minutes of life remaining\u2026Was accepting her own death her only option now?But, right after she had taken her first step, she stopped in her way.

(3)Still dazed, she walked inside the room at the end of the hall, the one that belonged to the original owner.This was a huge room that looked like a hotel room. It was quite obvious that it was put together as a guest room at the very last minute.Huo Sishen certainly was no big fan of this fianc\u00e9e. This room was very far from him. It seemed he didn\u2019t even attend their engagement ceremony. That, too, had aggravated the original owner, which lead her to the stupid decision of trying to flirt with the male lead.Gu Shishi quickly walked inside the bathroom and jogged to the front of the mirror.Just one look and she gasped.Beautiful!She was\u00a0 beautiful!Albeit being switched at birth and never having the lifestyle of a wealthy girl, that did not stop her from inheriting the outstanding genetic materials from her parents, the Gu\u2019s.Her skin was white like snow. Her figure was slender. Her pretty face was the shape of a V along with red lips and white teeth. Her eyes looked softer than water.Gu Shishi gulped.\u201cNo wonder she couldn\u2019t make it one day\u2026.

Her head was on top of a soft pillow, and she was deep asleep.It wasn\u2019t long before she was startled awake by a cold-looking face.She was then tossed out of the mansion along with a bag savagely by Huo Sishen.Then, a car drove passed and ran right over her, killing her!The unusually real painful feeling in her dream made her sit upright in bed![Life remaining: 11 hours 2 minutes and 31 seconds]Gu Shishi broke up into cold sweat!Shit, just one night and she slept away half of her blood bar.She must find a way to stay near this man.

They were available at the supermarket as an imported items, but this was the cost of 1.5L!That grim reaper Huo. Such twisted personality! Could he be more wasteful?Gu Shishi quickly wiped her mouth. Aye, she had just spit out $60 worth of milk. That was awful!She regretted greatly and only wish she could go back in time. But quickly, she saw a line of fine print on the screen.[Milk is considered a daily consumable and calculated at 5% rate. Recharged amount: $6.45.]Damn!

Happily, she put a piece of salmon roll into her mouth.[Recharge successfully!]Happily, Gu Shishi squinted her eyes. This eggroll was crispy and smooth, and has tender fresh salmon in the middle. Definitely the best that she has ever had.And a big bite recharged $10!\u201cEh, Mr. Chef, can I have some more salmon?\u201dThat\u2019s the most expensive one!\u201cThank you~\u201dDING! DING! DING!Gu Shishi kept on eating and the Blood Bar continued to increase.She was completely relished and enraptured in eating.Its money coming in with each juicy bite!Just when she was indulging in her activities, she heard urgent footsteps approaching her from afar.\u201cJie, Huo-da ge said he wanted to call off the engagement. What happened?\u201d The fragile, panting voice came before she saw the person.(T/N: Jie = older sister; da ge = oldest brother)\u201cShuangshuang, slow down, or you will have tightness in your chest again. She doesn\u2019t know how good she has it, there\u2019s nothing you can do about it,\u201d came the voice of Huo Wencheng.Gu Shishi looked up and saw the one who walked into the dining room first.A white dress that\u2019s taken in at the waist, hair down to her shoulder with a light blue hair band. Her entire person was enwrapped in a sense of fragile but soft attractiveness.This was the archnemesis of this body \u2013 Gu Wushuang , the girl who was born on the same day, switched on the same day and became the adopted daughter of the Gu\u2019s.\u201cJie, did you guys have a fight?\u201d Gu Wushuang walked over to her and tried to hold her hand in a friendly manner.But, Gu Shishi had a fork in her left hand and the knife in her right so she wasn\u2019t able to grab any of them. She stopped awkwardly in the middle.As much as Gu Wushuang tried to hide it, Gu Shishi could still detect the elusive despise and pride in her eyes.Gu Wushuang, who had been raised in the upper class for over 20 years, simply looked down on this girl who grew up in poverty.\u201cNothing,\u201d Gu Shishi gave her a run around with a chuckle.All she did was hide in his closet was all. Ho ho ho.\u201cJie\u2026\u201d Gu Wushuang quickly said, but was choked back by her own sob after just one word. Tears welled up in her eyes and were about to roll down any minute.Lowering her head, she covered her face painfully.\u201cI know, jie jie didn\u2019t like this arrangement. Huo-da ge doesn\u2019t have the best reputation, and he didn\u2019t even show up at the engagement ceremony. That wasn\u2019t nice of him. It was all because of me, all my fault\u2026\u2026\u201cIf only my body is healthy, I would be able to take your place and marry Huo-da ge, and not have to let you suffer.\u201d As she was speaking, her body shook from side to side, as though she had committed such an awful act and was ashamed to be seen by anyone.\u201cShuangshuang, that\u2019s nonsense! She\u2019s the daughter of Gu\u2019s, of course the engagement would be between her and my big brother. What does that have to do with you?\u201dHuo Wencheng, standing by her side, immediately catch her with his arms. His handsome face full of worry and heartache.\u201cForget about her! Let me take you home and have a doctor come and check you out.\u201dGu Shishi pursed her lips.Was that her little-white-flower trick?(T/N: little white flower = describes a woman being weak and fragile)She just pretended to be fragile every time, earned everyone\u2019s sympathy while she stood on the top of the moral standard, took away anything nice and pushed the original owner into a deep abyss?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You have been out there and been through so much already. But not to worry, from now on, anything that I have, you will have too!\u201dGu Shishi almost spilled the milk in her hand after she heard that spew. Hey, hey, hey, everything that belonged to the Wushuang belonged to the original owner to begin with, alright?Darn, this little white flower was so good at twisting the truth!\u201cJust go.\u201d Gu Shishi just waved at them to stop Gu Wushuang\u2019s whining. \u201cI am going to keep eating now.\u201dShe was too busy trying to extend her own life. She has no time for the little white flower.Using the toast in her hand, she cleaned up the remaining juice on the dinner plate and shoved the whole thing into her mouth and chewed in the most satisfying way.Her gauche act mortified the two. They could no longer hide the despise and contempt in their eyes.Gu Shishi, on the other hand, couldn\u2019t look more blessed.\u201cI am willing to be with him.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t him whom she\u2019d be marrying, it was her own life!Gu Wushuang\u2019s lips quivered, \u201cJie, you\u2026 are willing?\u201dShe didn\u2019t even need to use any of the speech that she had prepared before her trip. She had thought it would take her great effort to convince this peasant girl to stay instead of going back to the Gu\u2019s and fight over the Gu\u2019s inheritance with her.Gu Shishi had finished every last drop of juice on her plate and patted her full and round belly.\u201cYup. I\u2019ll stay. Even if I am leaving, I can leave on my own. It\u2019s not like I have a lot to take with me. No need for you to come pick me up, hmm?\u201d\u201cOh, sorry. I think this skirt belongs to you. I\u2019ll return it to you after it\u2019s been cleaned.\u201d\u201cAnd, by the way, when I put it on there\u2019s already a hole on the hem portion of the dress. I didn\u2019t do it. I\u2019ll try to fix it as best I can, just don\u2019t ask me to compensate you for that, alright?\u201d said Gu Shishi as she tilted her head and turned slightly toward the staircase. Looking down on the ground, she lightly closed her eyes.Yes, two could play that game. Everyone knew how to play the weak flower card.Gu Wushuang was so shocked that she had forgotten to cry. \u201cJie, this\u2026 this skirt, did Zhang-ma give this to you?\u201d(T/N: Zhang-ma \u2013 an old maid of the house. It\u2019s customary to refer to older maid who had been with the family for a long time as \u201cma\u201d.)A bit frantically, Gu Wushuang quickly turned and looked at Huo Wencheng. Seeing the shock on his face, she quickly placed one hand over her chest. Her elegant face was covered in pain.\u201cShuangshuang!\u201d Huo Wencheng quickly reached out his hand and placed it on her lower back. And just like that, she had successfully diverted his attention.\u201cJie, I didn\u2019t think that Zhang-ma would have\u2026.\u201d Tears in her eyes, Gu Wushuang\u2019s hands quivered.The real daughter of the Gu\u2019s wearing the old clothes belonging to the adopted one.

Raising his brows, he asked, \u201cYou didn\u2019t prepare any clothing for her?\u201dShe was his current fianc\u00e9e. As a formality, she should have anything that other women have as well.Siyi\u2019s had an odd look on his face, \u201cYoung Master, we have been buying clothes based on Gu Wushuang\u2019s sizes, but\u2026.\u201dNobody expected that the Gu\u2019s would suddenly gained a real daughter and they swapped the fianc\u00e9e in the last minute.\u201cWe haven\u2019t had the chance to swap them out yet. We thought she\u2019d have some of her own clothes when she came.\u201d\u201cBut, she didn\u2019t,\u201d said Huo Sishen as he pointed at the screen.The girl seated properly at the dinner table, both of her arms resting on the table holding onto the fork and the knife. Any slight movement and one could see how the fabric was stretched, showing her curvy figure.The color and the style of the dress were all outdated.She was sent over here before she even has some clothes that fit her!And, look at the way she was wolfing down the food. She had asked for two additional plates of salmon, as though she had been hungry for a long time.Huo Sishen couldn\u2019t help but frown.Even when he was forced to live in a more remote house back in the days, he still brought with him a closet full of clothing. And the servants brought over meals every day.It was just that as each year went by, they started diminishing. Until finally, he was completely forgotten.Crossing his legs, it seemed as though his entire good look was hidden in the dark.From the video, the girl\u2019s crisp voice rang again. \u201cI don\u2019t know of any Zhang-ma or Li-ma but I am staying here! Everybody wanted to get rid of me but he was the only one to have a place for me to stay, and let me eat as much as I want for three meals a day.\u201dHuo Sishen narrowed his eyes.That summer, he remembered clearly. His old dog was the only one willing to stay by his side other than the old butler.\u201cNow that we are engaged, then he is my responsibility. I am not leaving unless he tells me in person that we are over.\u201dThe girl in the video has red lips and white teeth. She bit off another half a salmon eggroll after she finished talking.Huo Sishen\u2019s frown deepened.The old butler died shortly after that. And, he had to bury the old dog the next spring.Everyone that cared about him at some point were all gone\u2026..\u201cXiao Shen, it\u2019s not that grandma doesn\u2019t want you anymore. We are just asking you to stay in the other house for the time being. There\u2019s just so much going on in the house right now that we aren\u2019t able to take care of you as well\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cEvery time your mom sees you, she has nightmares.

After we have everything straightened out, we will take you back\u2026\u2026\u201dHis long and slender fingers gripped the ceramic cup tightly, his knuckles crackling.Looking at the image on the screen, his eyes were dark like a deep ocean.Finally, his thin lips moved, \u201cYou have one hour.

Did Huo Sishen really wanted her to leave?She had two salmon rolls, a glass of milk, and two slices of toast for breakfast. She stuffed herself all the way to her throat, but the result was very promising.The breakfast filled her up almost 5 whopping hours!If she was lucky and throwing in possibly even more lavish lunch and dinner, she just might be able to get a whole day just from eating.But, once she left, she wouldn\u2019t get her three meals a day and with no income, her remaining life would be all gone in no time.She might be waving calmly to the little white flower, but she was panicking inside. What if her nightmare from the night before really came true?What if she had an accident the minute she stepped foot outside of the front door?\u201cNo matter what, I am not leaving!\u201d said Gu Shishi as she gripped tightly onto her utensils!Gu Wushuang reached up and wiped her red eyes to cover up a sarcastic smile.Okay, so this peasant girl got the right idea. She wouldn\u2019t be able to outsmart her even if she returned to the Gu\u2019s, so she was better off staying here with the man who has the reputation of a wife-curser, and maybe even get some of the Huo\u2019s inheritance in due time.Even the loose change that fell out from between their fingers would be enough to support her for the rest of her life!\u201cJie jie, then Cheng-ge ge and I will go and talk to Brother Huo, maybe we can talk him out of it\u2026\u201d said Gu Wushuang as she took a step forward.(T/N: ge ge \u2013 older brother)She wasn\u2019t even done talking when Huo Wencheng tugged at her. She looked up and saw the rumored savage Huo Sishen standing at the entrance of the dining room.He was tall and handsome, yet his dark eyes were bottomless. The shadow casting on his face made him look all the more ominous.Gu Wushuang turned pale right away. \u201cHuo-da ge.\u201d This was the first time she had seen him in his flesh and blood.Huo Sishen almost never engaged in any upper-class social gatherings, nor did he accept any media interviews. He was like a hermit that lived in the dark who couldn\u2019t be in the sunlight.Gu Wushuang was panicking, but she resorted to using her all powerful puffy eyes and looked at him pitifully. \u201cMy sister is not too mature, please bear with her\u2026 after all, the kind of education that she\u2019d had in the past wasn\u2019t quite the same as ours. And she had some bad experiences at her work place\u2026\u201dTears welling up in her eyes, quivering of the lips, all the tell-tale signs of a little white flower. It would work wonders in stimulating a man\u2019s desire to protect.Gu Wushuang tilted her head a 45-degree angle and gave the cold man a longing look. If only he wasn\u2019t a wife-curser and had lost the Huo\u2019s inheritance. He was such a handsome and majesty man, even better than his brother. He\u2019d have been the perfect spouse for her.What a bummer.\u201cHuo-da ge\u2026..\u201d She sobbed, her hand strategically placed over her heart.Nonetheless, what she got was a cruel and displease shout, \u201cWho do you think you are?\u201dHuo Sishen looked at her coldly.Gu Wushuang stopped crying immediately and thought she had misheard.\u201cIf you want to cry, get the hell out of my house first!\u201d Huo Sishen was frowning, making no effort in hiding his distaste.\u201cHuo Wencheng, didn\u2019t you brief her on my rules here? Siyi!\u201d\u201cGe!\u201d Huo Wencheng was nervous, but he was too late.Siyi already had his hand on Gu Wushuang, who let out a shriek, \u201cWho are you? Don\u2019t touch me!\u201dExpressionlessly, Siyi grabbed her like she was some kind of bacteria.

He had been getting worse as he had been left alone these last few years.\u201dHuo Wencheng\u2019s face twitched as he spoke, \u201cLet\u2019s go. If that woman wanted to stay, this is her problem now.\u201dGu Wushuang bit her lip, \u201cBut, my sister had been so down on luck and had such hardship before.

She had forgotten that she was next.She gritted her teeth, yet she couldn\u2019t help but turn pale!Was this her end?Soon, the man\u2019s deep and magnetic voice came from above her head, \u201cDo you know what happened to the two women who stayed before?\u201dGu Shishi paused for a second, \u201cUgh, they died\u2026 from accidents?\u201dThe novel did not write out in detail how they had died.\u201cAren\u2019t you scared?\u201d Huo Sishen narrowed his eyes at her and lifted her chin with his hand. \u201cA pretty flower today, a dried up one the very next day.\u201dGu Shishi blinked and her takeaway was, \u201cYou think I am pretty?\u201dHuo Sishen frowned some more. Immediately, his hand that had her chin tightened!He looked down and saw the hint of fragility between the girl\u2019s eyes.From her body, there came a hint of almost undetectable fragrance. It was unlike any of the cheap perfume. It was like a fragrance that came in with the breeze through the window, brushing the tip of his nose gently.A little sweet, a little clear, like the petal of a flower that was just touched by a petrichor.True. She was pleasing to the eyes, and the smell coming from her was alright as well.\u201cTSSSssss\u2026.\u201d Gu Shishi cried out in pain from his grip.Huo Sishen took a deep look at her and immediately a hint of disgust appeared on his handsome face. He let go of her all of a sudden.Siyi, who had just returned, immediately handed him a bottle of hand sanitizer.Gu Shishi was baffled, but still, she wouldn\u2019t let anything stand in her way to staying alive.\u201cHonestly, I like to stay clean too.

It seemed to have some year-old blackheads and whiteheads mixed in there\u2026Gu Shishi quickly walked over to her dressing table and that when she noticed that her face was covered in a layer of black dirt like a facial mask.She quickly opened up the drawer on her dressing table and used some cotton balls to gently apply toner to the dirty portion on her face.Once, twice\u2026 each time she had gone over them with the toner, more oil would appear\u2026.She used over half a bag of cotton balls before all the dirt was gone.\u201cWow, that almost worked too well.\u201dShe stared at her jade-like pale face and found it hard to believe.She immediately popped the remaining pill into her mouth and chewed it up like it was a piece of candy.More dirt appeared on her skin. She looked into the mirror again after she cleaned them all up\u2026. Pinkish skin with a hint of whiteness, her skin was smooth and not one blackhead or widened pore could be found. As though she had applied microdermabrasion or used a camera app filter, her skin was flawless!Content with the result, she stroked her skin that was smooth like water. It even felt better than it was before.The effect was amazing!She laid down on the couch happily and sighed as she looked at the system again.Doting of the male lead, acceptance by the others\u2026. How was she supposed to achieve that?If she wanted to level up, she\u2019d need Huo Sishen for the first criteria, and she need just anyone to like her for the second criteria?The system said for her to figure it out herself, guessed she\u2019d just have to give it a try!Thinking about that, Gu Shishi fished out the cellphone and looked through her friends\u2019 list on her WeChat account to see who she could start with for their fondness.Glancing at it, she saw a message from her adoptive mother.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Now, he has a splitting headache and couldn\u2019t even think.Except\u2026 for a brief moment in the morning.Because of the girl\u2019s fearless speech.It brought back his old memories.That very moment, there seemed to be a little bit of relief from his splitting headache.Huo Sishen looked down quietly at his own right hand with his deep and complex dark eyes.Earlier, the touch of the girl\u2019s skin, the softness and the fragrance\u2026. He seemed to still be able to feel them.He raised his brow and lifted his hand that he used to pinch the girl\u2019s chin.Just one second, and he frowned and lowered his hand.All he could smell now was disinfectant.\u201cYou are coming back to the clinic with me today.

It has nothing to do with me.\u201d\u201c\u2026. Me?!\u201d Qin Ruhai just wanted to strangle this man.The tense atmosphere in the room was interrupted by a knocking sound.Shortly, a crisp voice that sounded like ice water on the hottest day of summer, came like a welcomed relief, \u201cMr. Huo, are you in? Can I come in?\u201dQin Ruhai had an odd look all of a sudden.Grimm Huo\u2019s third fianc\u00e9e?Huo Sishen, still lying down on the couch, flickered his cold and lonely eyes.He waved impatiently at Si Yi.A moment later, Si Yi grabbed Qin Ruhai by the back of his collar and took him straight toward the door.\u201cSh*t, wait!\u201d\u201cPlease come in, Miss Gu,\u201d said Si Yi respectfully while still holding onto Qin Ruhai.It was Gu Shishi.\u201cThank you.\u201d As curious as she was, she didn\u2019t glance over at Qin Ruhai. She just walked straight into the room.The room door closed again. The darkness inside made Gu Shishi paused in her steps. It took her a little while to get used to the dim light.She looked around the room; something wasn\u2019t right.All the curtains in the room was tightly drawn.It was the brightest time on a summer day, but the room was dark and quiet like the middle of the night.She lifted her head and could barely see the man on the couch.He seemed to be in an extremely bad mood.He seemed like a vicious beast hiding in the dark that was just now slowly waking up!A cold look exuded from his dark eyes, full of impatience and coldness mixed with a spiral-like wind storm, as though he was trying his best to keep something in check, as though the very next second he could lose all of his control and tear her to pieces on the spot and devour her\u2026Goosebumps appeared on the back of Gu Shishi\u2019s neck.He might have looked cold when she saw him in his closet that very first time, but it was far from this sharp, bloodthirsty look!In the dining room this morning, he looked cold, but he had calmly handed her the disinfectant and then bought her a closet full of clothes.Any way she looked at him, he seemed to be a very nice person.It hasn\u2019t even been that long since then; how did his look turned so scary all of a sudden?What happened?At this rate, how was she going to improve his fondness for her?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She wondered if he\u2019d kill her if she told him the truth.His look was unbelievably intimidating.Huo Sishen let out a slight chuckle.Ah, she was just another one of them. Even down to the way she looked when she was afraid to tell the truth.He had seen that one way too many times.His mother, grandmother, brother, the servants at home \u2026 friends\u2026.Yes, he was the one that cursed his father, his grandfather, and his wives\u2026.. he was the one that everybody wanted to avoid at all costs.\u201cUgh, Mr. Huo, I am here to return your suit and to thank you for buying me new clothes.\u201d Gu Shishi took a glance at his deep and coldly prideful look, but she told him her purpose anyway.The smile on the corner of his mouth immediate turned into a cruel look.\u201cJust throw it out.\u201dShe was just like the woman who referred to him as her son.That woman couldn\u2019t wait to move everything that belonged to him out of the main house. She said it was so he could continue using them, but in reality, she was scared that anything that belonged to him would bring her bad luck.And this woman standing in front of him right now was also scared.Everything that she had said this morning. That she wanted to 'stay by his side\u201d\u2026 They were all lies!\u201cGet out!\u201d He couldn\u2019t contain his anger and his pain.\u201cOh?\u201d Gu Shishi was baffled.

Was it the way that she started the conversation?\u201cThen, should I give your suit to Si Yi for him to take care of?\u201dHuo Sishen\u2019s splitting headache was a 100-times worse than it was before.Looking up, he seemed to be able to catch a glance of her jade-like elegant and petite face. It seemed to be even more tender and lovely than it was earlier. And, her pink lips opened and closed, chattering non-stop\u2026. Like those annoying birds outside of the window.He lifted his hand. He wanted to tell her to get out again, but he couldn\u2019t get the words out of him.\u201cEh? Do you want your suit?\u201dSeeing his stretched-out arm, Gu Shishi naturally handed over the suit.As soon as she got close to him, Huo Sishen immediately smelled that barely noticeably rose fragrance again\u2026. It was from her.He smelled it earlier today too.Soft, sweet, and fragrant. Not too tart, not too overwhelming.It reminded him of when he used to follow the old butler around when he was watering the blooming roses in the summer days.The sun had been blinding, and the cicada made nonstop noises. He stayed there soaked in sweat until the old butler smiled and took him home by his hand\u2026.Gu Shishi was trying to hand his suit over to him and accidentally touched his large, feverish hand.She let out a small cry but when she wanted to withdraw her hand, it was already grabbed tightly by him!His strength was strong like that of a clamp, and she couldn\u2019t struggle free.\u201cBoss\u2026. Boss Huo?\u201d Gu Shishi couldn\u2019t comprehend what was going on.In just a few seconds, however, the large hand that was grabbing her let go of her slowly.Gu Shishi looked up with her limpid eyes and was surprised.The vicious person that was on the couch just a few moments ago now had his eyes closed, even his cold and stiff features seemed to have relaxed some.His breathing was peaceful and relaxing.His long and thick eyelashes cast shadows on his handsome face. He looked quite like a pretty boy falling asleep.Eh\u2026 he fell asleep?Gu Shishi was astonished.[Beep!

Was it because of his health?Gu Shishi\u2019s small, pink face was troubled.Quickly, she bent over and placed the suit in her hand gently over Huo Sishen.Boss, you must live till 100!She would need him to stay alive!Gu Shishi walked out of the room on her tipped toes after she had placed the suit on him.As soon as she walked outside, she saw the male doctor still pacing back and forth in front of the room.He had on a lab coat, tall, sharp brows and starry eyes, a pair of golden, wire-framed spectacles, and an undeniable smell of disinfectants.Seeing her coming out, he quickly walked over and was about to walk back into the room.Gu Shishi paused quickly and said, \u201cEh, wait, he\u2019s asleep.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Being interrupted, Qin Ruhai turned around and looked at the fair Gu Shishi.His manly features twitched.What a waste for a beauty like her.But what she just said was hilarious.Asleep?Who?

Following closely behind him was Siyi.They both understood clearly both Huo Sishen\u2019s temper and his health condition.If he could fall asleep so easily, Qin Ruhai wouldn\u2019t be here right now.\u201cUgh\u2026.\u201d Gu Shishi pursed her lips.

She seemed too frightened to approach him but she carried on chattering nonstop.Then he remembered his old butler and \u2026 then he fell asleep.Was he simply too tired?Perhaps, his body has reached its limit finallyHis hands that were resting next to his abdomen rolled into fists.With the slight movement of his arms, the suit that was laying on top of him slipped off of him.Huo Sishen looked closer and his groggy eyes saw the suit that was now only half-covering his body.Was she the one who placed it on his before she left?His thin lips were shut tightly; his brows furrowed, and he stood up.\u201cI don\u2019t know, Qin Ruhai.

Was she forced to do with work of a maid previously also?He pictured her wearing old grey clothes with buckets and buckets of water around her as she wiped the floor using a rag while sweat dripped down from her. Was she not crying because she was already used to it all?Or, she had already cried too much and had no more tears left\u2026Huo Sishen frowned as he was thinking about it.Not too much time had passed before he heard a strange noise. It was both familiar and strange.He frowned, \u201cWho is that making all that noise?\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026 Miss Gu is singing.\u201dNot only did she not cry, she seemed to be quite happy. Siyi looked down and didn\u2019t dare to say the second part of what was on his mind.Huo Sishen, \u201c!\u201d\u201cYoung Master, Miss Gu had also asked\u2026.\u201d Siyi paused for a second before he continued, \u201cIf she would be paid for her work.\u201dThe corner of Huo Sishen\u2019s mouth twitched instantly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

One only needed to stand outside for a short while before the sun above and the skin that was now burning would made one irritated.Gu Shishi\u2019s little face was beet red and sweat kept pouring out of her forehead and the tip of her nose.She was still wearing the face mask from when she was cleaning the living room. Once she was outdoors, the mask was soaked through by her sweat before long, so she just took it off.\u201cMiss Gu, don\u2019t just water the plants. The weeds need to be taken care of too,\u201d said a chubby, freckled maid with her hands resting on her waist. The maid might look very stern, but she couldn\u2019t refrain all of her pleasant surprise and her sense of superiority from showing.When would a maid ever had the opportunity to boss around a girl from a wealthy family?!Yet today, such an opportunity was offered up to her, Shi Li!Never mind this fianc\u00e9e of the Young Master grew up in an ordinary family and had only been a wealthy girl for just a few days; the opportunity to boss her around still excited Shi Li.Shi Li didn\u2019t even feel toilsome slaving under the scorching sun, sweating along-side the wealthy girl.\u201cYou must pull these weeds one by one by hand. The scissors might damage the flowers accidentally, so you must do it by hand. That\u2019s how I always do it.\u201dWho else could give a wealthy girl such a hard time as to pull weeds out one by one?Having said that, Shi Li looked even happier than she was before.\u201cOkay, Shi-jie.\u201d Said Gu Shishi as she wiped away the sweat on her forehead. She couldn\u2019t control the smile on her face.(T/N: jie \u2013 older sister / female)She checked the interface intermittently as she was weeding.[Received fondness from Siyi and Butler Lin. \u201cAcknowledgement of Others\u201d leveled up to LV 1!][Host\u2019s current level: LV1 \u2013 The Prominent Family\u2019s Fianc\u00e9e on the Slippery Slope.][Other\u2019s Acknowledge: LV1][Doting of the Male Lead: LV1][Maximum Life: 5 days.][Current Remaining Balance: 71 hours 14 minutes and 24 seconds.]Happy~She would never have thought that some simple housework would earn her fondness from both the butler and Siyi~This was easier than she had imagined!Now she can live for 5 days!Just thinking about it was able to keep that smile on her face.But, the system was so cheap, the maximum for LV2 was just 5 days?!\u201cHurry up, Miss Gu! It only takes me an hour normally to do all these by myself!\u201d said Shi Li in an imperious tone.Perhaps, even she had noticed that her tone might be problematic, so Shi Li quickly added, \u201cThe butler said that I must stay here to watch over you!\u201d\u201cYes, yes! I understand, Shi-jie. Why don\u2019t you go have a seat on the side? I will work faster!\u201d said Gu Shishi with a bright smile and sparkly eyes.She had no gloves on; she was clawing at the soil and pulling the weeds with her bare hands.Many of the flower beds were quite low, so she had no choice but to half kneel on the ground and lean all the way over to take care of the weeds deep within the flower beds.She needed to collect the next batch of fondness!She wondered if she might be able to collect them from Shi Li!Right this moment, Huo Sishen, who was standing in the shadow by the lobby, looked into the garden with his quiet, dark eyes. His pupils contracted a little.All of the girl\u2019s full-bodied black hair was hidden inside her hat with just a few playful strands poking out from under it and cutely falling down the side of her soft and bright face.He could tell from afar how excited she was.It was as though it wasn\u2019t a flower bed that she was cleaning right now, but an elegant art piece.On her knees, she would occasionally lift up her small face and look at the blooming flowers and their branches. She would always resume weeding and trimming only after she had studied the flowers.After her touch, the branches in the flower beds were much more layered and aesthetically pleasing than before.She really wasn\u2019t crying. In fact, she appeared to be quite happy\u2026. Was she serious about wanting to be paid?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I just wanted to trim the flowers a little, this way the flower buds would get more nutrients as well as have a more pleasing layering effect.\u201d Gu Shishi explained quickly.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be concerned with whether it\u2019s pleasing or not! We have gardeners who\u2019d take care of that! You just focus on wedding! Haven\u2019t Butler Lin listed them all out for you?\u201d Shi Li\u2019s voice was quite loud.\u201cOh yes, I am sorry.\u201d Said the girl, sounding a little disappointed.Huo Sishen\u2019s brows furrowed.\u201cYoung Master, the car is ready.\u201d Siyi, standing next to him, opened up the car door of the car parking outside the front of the house.Huo Sishen looked down but he didn\u2019t move.\u201cMmm,\u201d he said after a long while.Having said that, Siyi noticed that his boss hadn\u2019t moved an inch. He looked over where Huo Sishen was looking at with a slightly displeased look and noticed the two people in the garden.Miss Gu?\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d Words came out of Huo Sishen\u2019s thin lips.\u201cUgh\u2026 You mean Shi Li from Gardening?\u201d Naturally, Siyi knew everyone who worked in the mansion.\u201cGreasy, sloppy, and noisy.\u201d Said Huo Sishen as he squinted.Siyi\u2019s heart skipped a beat immediately. He looked in the direction with sympathy in his eyes.\u201cI understand. I will have the butler take care of it.\u201d She would either be fined or fired.But\u2026 working under the sun, it wasn\u2019t her fault that her sweat had messed up her makeup. Siyi shook his head.He was just about to look away when he caught sight of Miss Gu, standing nearby. Her cheeks were pink but, truthfully, there were no signs of oiliness on her face at all. Even her sweat looked natural and clear.What a dramatic difference!After hearing Siyi\u2019s response, Huo Sishen nodded in approval and quickly walked up and got into the car.The air conditioning had been running in the car, and one couldn\u2019t feel any of the heat from the outside. The car made a turn and quickly drove down the path between the garden and toward the front entrance.As they drove passed the flower bed, one could see even clearer the girl who was kneeling on the ground; there were small beads of sweat on the tip of her nose and her moisten long and curly eyelashes wavered like butterflies.Through the car window, the look in Huo Sishen\u2019s eyes deepened.From the passenger seat, Siyi turned around and asked, \u201cYoung Master, we are heading into the office directly, right?\u201dHuo Sishen sat there properly but his eyes were still lingering toward the outside, \u201cWhat\u2019s the temperature today?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d How did the conversation jump there? Baffled, Siyi looked down at his phone, \u201c36 degrees Celsius right now; going to be 38 later in the day.\u201dHuo Sishen pursed his lips. An image popped up immediately in his mind. It was the little face that was bright red from the heat of the sun.\u201cTime off.\u201dSiyi turned around right away, \u201cEh?\u201d\u201cEverybody at the mansion has today off.\u201d Huo Sishen stopped looking outside and expressionlessly picked up the documents that was sitting next to him. \u201cPaid time off.\u201dSiyi finally was able to turn back around. He found his voice again after a long while, \u201cOh\u2026. Okay.\u201dHe has been with Young Master Huo for 7 years, and this was the first time he had heard of a day off.Was it the temperature outside?The Young Master must be in a good mood having been able to sleep for 2 hours!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Miss Gu, you should return to your room too.\u201dGu Shishi blinked her limpid eyes and looked at the half-finished flower bed regretfully. There were all different colors of roses here and many rare and precious ones as well.She was hoping to trim and give them a nice outline so they can be even more aesthetically pleasing.\u201cOh okay, I guess I will finish up some other day~\u201dButler Lin nodded.Gu Shishi stopped again after only a few steps, \u201cBut you must let me know when we resume the work in the flower beds again. Please, please do.\u201dDoing chores around the house could also extend her life!All these rags, masks, gloves would recharge her life!And, as she checked again, the item \u201cAcknowledgement of Others\u201d is already at 5% toward the next level\u2026.That clearly indicated that doing house work could further gain her fondness from others!Oh, she hoped the boss would boss her around more often. He must!Surprise flashed through Butler Lin\u2019s face but with her looking at him with such anticipation, he had no choice but to nod awkwardly.Gu Shishi finally left in satisfaction after Butler Lin had agreed. She hadn\u2019t forgot to thank Shi Li repeatedly before she took off.Anyhow, right after she had walked away, Shi Li was stopped by the solemn butler. \u201cYou\u2019re fined half a month\u2019s salary.\u201d\u201cWHY?!\u201d Shi Li was shocked.Butler Lin looked toward the mansion and said, \u201cThere\u2019s only one rule here \u2013 talk less, work more.\u201dShi Li turned pale immediately. It was because\u2026.Gu Shishi was equally pale when she walked back into her room.She stripped off her clothes that were soaked in sweat and took a shower before she comfortably laid down on the couch and shook her bare feet as she drank cold milk.She happily appreciated her blood bar that was now a few minutes above 3 days, and the system message of \u201cincrease in fondness from Shi Li\u201d\u2026.But, her happiness was short lived. The WeChat message that came in a minute later had her shrieking at the phone.[Xiaomei: I will bring homemade cupcakes to work for you tomorrow. You can skip breakfast. We can go to that new western restaurant for lunch after our end of probation assessment.]Ling Xiaomei was a colleague of the original owner. As they were close in age, they always had lunch together.But\u2026.\u201cAye! I am going to lose my three life-extending meals starting tomorrow?\u201dGu Shishi finally realized the blind spot in her logic from this last couple of days!She had been distracted by the race against death counter the last couple of days and had completely forgotten that she has to go to work!This last two days was the weekend and she didn\u2019t have to go in to work, which was the only reason she was able to laze around the mansion.Normally, she worked as an assistant instructor at an art center in a shopping mall located in the central area of the city.She usually had lunch outside of the house.Sometimes ,the art center has night classes that geared toward working individuals. On those days, she would even have her dinners outside of the house.\u201cOh no!! Does that mean I can only have my life-extending meals on the weekends?!\u201d Each of those meals could extend my life for 5~6 hours!With her cellphone held in her hands, she was crying inside.Never mind about this end of probation assessment!The key right now is \u2013 Boss\u2026 Help!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She ate too much for dinner and spent the night playing Mr. Love: Queen\u2019s Choice as she wasn\u2019t able to fall asleep with a full stomach.Now that she was woken up by her alarm, she felt tired and dizzy.She wanted to crawl out of bed, but finally fell back down after yawning many times.Finally, after snoozing three more times, she struggled to get out of bed. With severe dark circles around her eyes, she walked into the bathroom in extreme grogginess.As she couldn\u2019t keep her eyes open, she squinted as she brushed her teeth while randomly pulling something from her closet and put it on.After she was done washing her face and looked in the mirror, she noticed that the white tee-shirt that she wearing had a large and eye-catching Chanel logo \u2013 the interlocking twin C\u2019s \u2013 in gaudy sequins.And, the denim skirt that she threw on had two dark blue ribbons on the side of the waist. On top of that, it was hand embroidery with the name \u201cGivenchy\u201d in English.That was high-profile, alright.She was used to like cotton clothing that was comfortable; rarely had she pursued designer brands.But\u2026 it was all fate!Gu Shishi looked at her left side and her right. She cracked open her mouth and smiled into the mirror for almost half a minute.She was wearing $10,000 \u2013 $20,000 worth of blood bar, how could she not look gorgeous?She looked gorgeous as hell!Gu Shishi nodded happily.She tidied up her purse and checked and made sure she has her cellphone, keys, and employee badge before she yawned and walked out of her room.Coming downstairs, she walked through the corridor covered in red carpet. All the servants that she walked past were working with their heads down and not a peep could be heard, nor did anyone look up at her.The entire mansion was like a dried-up well and everybody inside of it was expressionless.\u201cMorning~\u201d Gu Shishi smiled and waved at them. She didn\u2019t care if they responded back to her.As she walked past the half-opened style small dining area next to the living room, Gu Shishi\u2019s limpid eyes scanned and lingered over each breakfast item with utmost longing and tenderness\u2026.Orange juice, soft-boiled eggs, tuna on toast with bacon on the side\u2026..These were all items that would fill up her blood bar!These were all panacea that could keep her alive for a long, long time!But, she wouldn\u2019t be able to have them today. Sob!Gu Shishi rubbed her starving tummy and regretted so much that she had slowed her steps.As her sight continued to the end of the table, her almond-shaped limpid eyes abruptly met the cold, dark eyes that looked like an iced pond, cold as ice, and bottomless.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dGu Shishi\u2019s pink lips dropped open a little. She was stunned.Huo Sishen, in his full suit, was right now sitting properly at the end of the dinner table and having his breakfast solemnly.He looked like he had just taken a shower and his wet hair was roughly brushed back by hand. His full and shiny forehead was exposed. It added another touch of roughness and wildness to his incredibly handsome face and also making him looked like a vicious beast who had just woken up in the morning.\u201cBig, big boss\u2026.\u201dShe hadn\u2019t seen him at the dining area in the last couple of days.So that was because he woke up before her every day?The fork in Huo Sishen\u2019s hand paused for a bit.His deep eyes squinted, \u201cBig boss?\u201dGu Shishi let out a howl within herself!How was she so stupid to slip and address him by the secret nickname that she had for him.\u201cUgh, mistake\u2026. Mistake. Good morning, Mr. Huo.\u201d She blushed slightly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His lips turned into cold, hard lines.\u201cDo not ever let me hear that stupid term a second time.\u201d His voice was coarse and icy cold like metal.Gu Shishi stuck her tongue out quickly and said, \u201cOkay.\u201dHuo Sishen nonchalantly looked away from her and paid her no more attention.Gu Shishi looked up carefully.She saw the slender and strong fingers of the man, his very well-defined digit holding the silver fork in the most proper manner. On the fork, there was a piece of sumptuous and aromatic bacon\u2026 that was worth at least $15 of blood, a few minutes of life!Her limpid, almond-shaped eyes couldn\u2019t help but follow his slender fingers upward.The juicy bacon was bitten into his handsome and thin lips\u2026. Along with the grinding action of his teeth and lips, the up and down movement of his Adam\u2019s apple, it was swallowed\u2026.Gu Shishi gulped at the same time.She wanted some of that bacon. She wanted to refill her blood!The gulping sound wouldn\u2019t have been a big deal.But, in the otherwise soundless dining area, it was as abrupt as a fork hitting the plate.Huo Sishen\u2019s deep, water-like look pierced directly at the girl in a dark, cold, and sharp manner.What he saw was crystal-clear limpid eyes looking at him, wet and soft beyond words. He suddenly felt his chest tightened.This was a look that he hadn\u2019t seen in years\u2026.She looked like a stray cat on the side of the road asking to be fed. Looking at you with its limpid eyes, softly getting closer and closer to you\u2026Yet, he was the one that was cursed from the very beginning. He would bring about bad luck and death to any life form that got close to him!Huo Sishen\u2019s pitch black pupils contracted all of a sudden!\u201cHave you never eaten before?\u201dHe slammed down the force in his hand the very next second.\u201cSuch poor manners! You disgust me!\u201dRight after he had said that, the cold beams from his black eyes paused all of a sudden.Her pink cheeks just a second ago had turned pale!The colors in the limpid eyes that were looking at him disappeared altogether and replaced by enormous fear, helplessness, and panic!\u201cOh, sorry, big\u2026 Mr. Huo. I\u2026 I am just a little hungry\u2026\u201d said the terrified Gu Shishi.She seemed to have raised his anger to 100%. He was about to explode?!He looked so angry right now as thought he wanted to just toss her out of the window that very minute!\u201cI shouldn\u2019t interrupt you any longer. I am going to head out to work!\u201dShe ran away from the small dining room fast like a rabbit. Even her wave at him barely looked like a wave.She worried that if she didn\u2019t run away fast enough, his fondness toward her would begin to drop!Huo Sishen pursed his lips and, looking at her fleeing back, he slowly looked down.Just what he had wanted.Like a frightened kitty, she ran as far away as she could!She hadn\u2019t wanted to stay for an extra second.He looked back at the plate in front of him. His eyes darkened, and his handsome face was overcast.He had lost all of his appetite.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She still needed to rely on herself to commute to and from the mansion.She brought herself into the center of the city and hopped onto the overcrowded subway. When she finally arrived at the mall where she worked, it was almost time for the first class.\u201cShishi!\u201d Before she walked into the elevator, she was stopped by a crisp voice.She turned around and saw a girl wearing a black-framed spectacle and hair tied up into a bun. She had on a nerdy pair of overall with big pockets and she was waving at Gu Shishi cheerfully.\u201cYou feeling any better?\u201d This was Ling Xiaomei, original owner\u2019s colleague, also recently graduated from art school.The original owner only took sick leave for the engagement ceremony. She hid everything about herself, from turning out to be from a prominent family to her engagement.\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d Gu Shishi blinked awkwardly.She had the original owner\u2019s memories. She knew that the original owner did not hide everything because she was low key, but that she was still holding out hope for Huo Wencheng and didn\u2019t want to accept her engagement with Huo Sishen.As for being found by the Gu\u2019s, she wanted to wait until the Gu\u2019s has accepted her before she bragged in front of her colleagues, which was why she hasn\u2019t told anyone about it yet.Ling Xiaomei wrapped her arm around her shoulder and walked into the elevator with her. She turned and suddenly noticed the dark circles around her eyes.\u201cYou still don\u2019t look 100% and you seem a little down\u2026 eh?\u201dShe was hal way through what she was saying before she suddenly jumped ahead of her.Her red phoenix eyes behind her black frame examined Gu Shishi\u2019s little face closely.(T/N: red phoenix eyes:- eyes whose outer corners incline upwards. How Asians are usually depicted in western cartoons.)\u201cShishi, what brand of foundation are you using today? The effect is amazing. It looks completely transparent with not powdery at all!\u201d\u201cIf it could also double as a better concealer and conceal those dark circles on you then it\u2019d be perfect.\u201dLing Xiaomei was still a little shorter than Gu Shishi. When she walked up close to her, her nose was almost touching Gu Shishi\u2019s neck.\u201cEh? You had perfume on today as well?\u201d Rolling her eyes, Ling Xiaomei sniffed a few times in the air.\u201cUgh\u2026 sort of.\u201dGu Shishi\u2019s small face was a little flustered.This was the rose body scent that was a gift from the system that could only be detected within 10 cm.The normal distance between people was around 50 cm to 1 meter; in theory, nobody should be able to notice that.But right now, Ling Xiaomei was a little too close.Ding!As the elevator door opened, Gu Shishi quickly dashed out, only to be caught up by Ling Xiaomei shortly.Gu Shishi was scrutinized from head to toe by Ling Xiaomei\u2019s enthusiastic gossipy look.\u201cShishi, are you in love?\u201d asked Ling Xiaomei as her eyes widened. \u201cYour entire body is exuding the lovely scent of being in love.\u201dLovely? Gu Shishi almost bit her own tongue.As they were chitchatting, they had arrived at the front entrance of the art center.\u201cHey! Look at Gu Shishi in her awesome full knockoff youthfulness!\u201d A mean and sarcastic woman\u2019s voice interrupted their conversation abruptly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Just below her clavicles, there was a Tiffany diamond key pendant. She was looking at her and Ling Xiaomei sarcastically.This was Zhao Xian, one of the new teachers at the art center.Also, like them, she had just graduated from college and was in her probation period right now.And, right now, she also faced the question of whether she\u2019d be staying or be eliminated once the probation period was up.Zhao Xian was, obviously, very confident in herself.It seemed she had just arrived and was chatting with the store manager, Liu Li. She had just said something that made the store manager giggle.And right now, she was looking at Gu Shishi with great interest.\u201cShihi, and here I thought you took time off so you can stay home and prepare for the permanent position assessment. After all, your performance was the worst among all of us. I didn\u2019t think you went shopping instead?\u201dThere was a shred of contempt in her look.\u201cLet me guess. These the rumored cheap and authentic-looking super knock-offs from East Avenue?\u201d\u201cHahaha, I guess dressing like this will make you feel more confident in the employment assessment?\u201dGu Shishi was just grabbing the apron with her name tag on it. She paused a little bit in her movement when she heard the smack talk.The original Gu Shishi was the bottom of all the new employees, let it be her drawing skill or her performance at work. Naturally, she was the one most likely to be eliminated!\u201cXiao Xian, why do you say that? Shishi is a pretty girl, and she looks good no matter how she dresses.\u201d Ling Xiaomei noticed something was wrong, so she immediately chimed in to smooth things over and tugged Gu Shishi a little so she wouldn\u2019t escalate things.Fighting in front of the store manager would leave a bad impression. Not to mention there were a few other instructors around as well.This was the day that all employees on probation would be evaluated, so a few of the senior employees would join the store manager in decided who to keep or not to keep.Based on their performance this past 3 months plus their performances during the assessment today, they would arrive at a conclusion and sent the final reports to upper management.Zhao Xian smiled but wouldn\u2019t drop the subject.\u201cMeimei, it doesn\u2019t bother me personally. But our art center is located at the busiest financial district and many of our clients are white collars or full-time housewives. On the weekends, there are even more elites bringing their kids here.\u201cAll I am saying is it will leave a bad impression with our clients if they find out that our instructors are wearing knock-offs.\u201cShishi, I have nothing against you. I am only looking out for everybody\u2019s interest at the art center. What do you think?\u201dShe sounded like she had given this a lot of thought and was especially worried about the future of the art center. In addition, she was even very respectful of Shishi and asked her about her opinion on it.As pretty as her words sounded, she was obviously setting Gu Shishi up!Liu Li, the store manager, looked again at Gu Shishi\u2019s outfit with obvious disapproval.\u201cWe have work aprons at work; there\u2019s no need to dress like that. You are free to dress however you want during your time off, but please be more mindful when you come to work. After all, our job is to teach kids.\u201dShe was entirely over on Zhao Xian\u2019s side!Most of the experienced employees of the art center were also nodding on the side, kissing up to Liu Li.Gu Shishi looked down at the intertwined C logo on her tee shirt.Knockoffs?Nobody knew the cost of each article of clothing better than she did.\u201cOh, I am a more straight-forward person. You are not mad at me, are you, Shishi?\u201d said Zhao Xian with a smile.But, her look was filled with a sense of superiority. She even reached her hand up and brushed it over her Tiffany diamond key around her neck, feeling proud.Half way through her snickering, she was interrupted by Gu Shishi saying, \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be disrespectful\u2026 This shirt cost $5,600 and this skirt was $18,000.\u201dGu Shishi twisted the corner of her skirt with a complicated look.She had just verified them again with the system. Her data was very precise.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Did you empty out all of your savings?\u201dThey were only making $4,000 per month during the probation period. And one could easily tell Gu Shishi wasn\u2019t from money from the way she dressed normally.And suddenly she was able to upgrade to a $20,000 set of clothes?Liar!Zhao Xian didn\u2019t even need to think that hard to figure that one out.\u201cNope. Someone bought them for me.\u201d Gu Shishi was an honest girl.\u201cSomeone?\u201d Zhao Xian was stunned.Even Ling Xiaomei couldn\u2019t help but gasp. The store manager and experienced employees all looked in their direction.\u201cReally, Shishi? Your boyfriend? I didn\u2019t know you are seeing someone?\u201d\u201cWhat is the background of your rich boyfriend? Why didn\u2019t you introduce him to us?\u201dThere were a lot of women in the art center, and they all enjoyed gossip.Work hours hasn\u2019t even started yet, and now all the more everybody had completely forgotten about the employment assessment.Just the idea of a man who was rich enough and willing to buy designer brand clothes for a girl was enough to make every woman\u2019s blood boil.Zhao Xian took a look at Gu Shishi\u2019s pretty face and jealousy flashed passed her eyes.She had just found herself a second-generation rich boyfriend last month and feeling very proud of herself, but now Gu Shishi, the one who was ranked at the bottom of everything she did, also got herself one?\u201cNothing much to share, just the engagement that was arranged by my family.\u201d Gu Shishi turned her palms upward and owned up to it.The truth would come out sooner or later.She came to work everyday and came into contact with all these people. Sooner or later, they\u2019d find out that she was engaged and living at her fiance\u2019s place.It\u2019s better to just come clean now rather than when others found that out on their own. She didn\u2019t need rumors that she was a kept woman, say from someone like Zhao Xian, who had nothing better to do.\u201cEngagement?\u201dZhao Xian was initially shocked, but most of her jealousy quickly disappeared from her eyes.A regular family\u2019s engagement with a prominent family?She almost busted out laughing.Then, it was either the rich man\u2019s second marriage, or it was someone old and ugly.Or, Gu Shishi made it all up!\u201cWow! You mean you have a fianc\u00e9 now?!\u201d Ling Xiaomei, who was simple-minded, was envious, \u201cDo you have a picture? Show us quickly!\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026. I don\u2019t.\u201dGu Shishi didn\u2019t even have the boss\u2019s WeChat, never mind his picture.\u201cWell then is he going to come pick you up from work afterward? We want to see!\u201d Even the experienced employees were getting excited.\u201cUgh, maybe sometime in the future\u2026 eh, should we start the assessment?\u201dThe boss picking her up from work?She\u2019d be happy if he didn\u2019t get rid of her.Zhao Xian saw the dodginess in Gu Shishi.She found that very amusing. Just when she was about to point that out, she was interrupted by the store manager Liu Li.Liu Li looked at the time, clapped her hands, and said, \u201cOkay, we can continue this chat during our lunch break. Class is going to start at 10:00. Let\u2019s start with our assessment before it\u2019s too late.\u201dOnce she said that, everybody else refocused themselves.\u201cWe want to see how much you have improved after three months of hands-on experience.\u201cToday, we would like you to each draw a picture using the client\u2019s favorite flower subject and do a mock session.\u201cYour target audiences are new students with no background.\u201dLiu Li explained the subject for the assessment.The few experienced employees all found a seat in the classroom and sat down, playing the role of students.\u201cI\u2019ll start!\u201d said Zhou Xian matter-of-factly.The first contestant usually got the best impression. It\u2019s important for a teacher to be passionate and assertive.Liu Li nodded.Ling Xiaomei wasn\u2019t the type who\u2019d fight over anything, and Gu Shishi had no experience teaching students with no background, so she decided it was best for her to start from observing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She was able to complete her drawing of Lotus in The Summer Time in less than 10 minutes.Four to five bingdi lotuses, pink in color contrasted by their bright green leaves. It was, indeed, a simple foundation drawing and very suitable for someone with no background.Picture: Bingdi lotuses (like Siamese twins of lotus \ud83d\ude0a)Source: wikipedia\u201cThank you, everyone,\u201d said Zhao Xian as she walked away from the board and cast a glance over at Gu Shishi in an instigating way. \u201cWould you like to go next, Shishi? There\u2019s still a lot of white space left on my piece of drawing paper, you can just use the same one.\u201dGoing up immediately after her, and on the same piece of paper, how better to show that her skills were several leagues higher than that of Gu Shishi!Even back in the art school, Gu Shishi was garbage, nothing like a good student like herself!A comparison could do even more damage!If they must eliminate even one employee, then it must be Gu Shishi!Zhou Xian handed the brush over to Gu Shishi without allowing her the opportunity to object. Now all she needed to do was to kick back and wait for her to embarrass herself.\u201cOh, alright,\u201d said Gu Shishi as she casually took the paint brush from her.Watercolor was fairly similar to Chinese ink painting. She had experience with watercolor in the past, plus she just watched Zhao Xian demonstrated it once. She was not intimidated.Plus, with her 20 years of painting experience, she could immediately tell that Zhao Xian\u2019s skills were still far from perfection.As much as the petals on her flowers looked complete, her style was simple and lacked spirit. The curvature of the lotus leaves, the texture of the petals and stem were all off and lacked a lively feel.She stood up nonchalantly after she had accepted the paintbrush.\u201cGo, Shishi!\u201d said Ling Xiaomei as she looked at Gu Shishi, worried.Gu Shishi gave her a \u201cdon\u2019t-worry\u201d look.She examined the tip of the paint brush for a little bit before she dabbed it casually on the blotting paper sitting on top of the table a couple of times and got rid of most of the pink color that was left on it.She closed her eyes and took a deep breath.She had come back to life for just a few days, but it felt like it had been an entire life\u2019s time.But as soon as she held the paintbrush in her hand, the familiar feeling returned immediately!Zhao Xian looked at Gu Shishi watchfully the entire time. The way Gu Shishi had her eyes closed made her feel even more sure that she had already won the battle.\u201cOh, Shishi, are you nervous? Relaaa\u2026.\u201dBut the rest of the word \u201crelax\u201d was stuck in her throat.She stood the closest and could immediately saw what Gu Shishi was doing.She saw Gu Shishi picked up the brush in one smooth act, lightly tapped it in the water before she, again, lightly dab in the fuchsia color.Her action had a gracefulness that Zhao Xian had never seen before, and it was almost pleasing to the audience.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Going from the bottom up, with a quick pull and tug, she added an entire outline with just one stroke!In just under 2 seconds, a pink budding flower bud that looked like it was waving in the wind appeared on the drawing paper!The color of the flower petal was rich, the fuchsia color was vibrant, and the area in the middle of the flower bud was created from the spreading of just water, making the belly of the flower a slightly white and plump.Gu Shishi\u2019s strokes was very casual, but each stroke created yet another flower. All the lotuses were created from one stroke each!Zhao Xian\u2019s mouth dropped open and in barely a few seconds, her cheeks turned beet red!Her drawing was on the upper right hand corner of the drawing paper, and Gu Shishi\u2019s was on the lower left.And right now, the difference between the two was stark clear.The lotus that she drew looked alright by itself, but when contrasted, it looked like the product of a 5-cent copy of an image!The lotuses drawn by Gu Shishi were lifelike and vivid. Had she not been watching this the entire time, she would be convinced that the store manager was the one who drew this.How was that possible?Zhao Xian was stunned.She had only taken a few days off. Had she taken some miracle pills in the last few days that her skills had such dramatic improvement?!How was that possible?!At the same time, Gu Shishi had also started her narration, \u201cDepending on the angle and strength that you apply, the effect on your drawing will also be different, for example\u2026.\u201dAs she talked, her hand never stopped, and she drew another lotus leaf. It looked like it was blowing in the wind and ready to leap out of the paper any minute!\u201cIn watercolor, we stress using different thickness of the paint to emphasize lights and shadows. Through the strength that you apply when painting, you can create the difference between the buds and the stems of the flowers\u2026\u201dThe entire classroom was quiet.Liu Li, the store manager, was also surprised by how Gu Shishi had created this painting.After she was done talking, the way that everyone looked at her had changed notably!Everyone there was an expert in this field. Naturally, they were able to tell the difference between the quality of drawings.Ling Xiaomei, who was waiting to go up next, was almost in tears, \u201cDang it, Shishi! I should have gone before you!\u201dNow the pressure was just tremendous!\u201cDon\u2019t worry, just relax.\u201d Smiled Gu Shishi as she patted her on her shoulder.Zhao Xian\u2019s face was completely darkened. Now even the softie Ling Xiaomei had no more respect for her!Gu Shishi, who had just take a seat and was just about to cheer Ling Xiaomei on, suddenly received a notification on her cellphone.It was a notification that someone had added her on WeChat\u2026Her limpid eyes widened immediately!The icon of the user was the character \u201cSi\u201d in Chinese!Huo Sishen!The boss!Did he add her proactively?!Gu Shishi almost cried out loud as she clutched her phone emotionally.She opened it up and read the note.She paused.[Note: Miss Gu. I am Siyi.]\u201cUgh\u2026.\u201dShe felt devastated!Gu Shishi bit her lips and approved his request to add her.Of course, the boss would never add her proactively\u2026.Just when she was moping about it, another message popped up.[Siyi: Miss Gu, I am going to bring you lunch. What is a good time for you?]Oh!Gu Shishi\u2019s little heart hopped right back onto a rollercoaster and shot right up into the sky!***Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She felt dizzyingly lucky!If not for this meal, she could only consume her remaining life balance during the daytime and her blood bar would go down by at least half a day.This meal could keep her bar unchanged at least!Both of Gu Shishi\u2019s eyes turned into straight lines from her smile.Happy like a hamster, she was basking in happiness as she hugged her phone.The boss\u2026 \u201cis so nice~\u201dLeveling up to LV1 doting was so nice!Nothing could make her happier than being able to live to 100 or beyond!Death was too scary. Plus, she wouldn\u2019t be able to draw again if she was dead.The further she had gone down the path of traditional Chinese painting, the more she learned that there was no end in sight on that path.She wanted to live another 100 years, and draw for another 100 years!One day, she would be able to master the use of ink painting and breakthrough to the master of this trade and create her own style!Just like her master, she would have people coming to her nonstop to ask for a painting from her. There would be so many people that the threshold to her place would break.\u201cShishi, look at you, smiling so happily. Are you laughing at Meimei\u2019s painting skill?\u201dShe hadn\u2019t expected Zhao Xian\u2019s comment coming out of the blue when she was smiling to herself.Being interrupted in the middle of her fantasy, Gu Shishi looked up just in time to see Ling Xiaomei walking back to her seat, flustered.1The chrysanthemum on the drawing paper was, indeed, a little problematic.Possibly because of nervousness, the lines in the drawing was stiff and the transitions between the different colors was unnatural.\u201cEven though Meimei wasn\u2019t performing to her usual level today, it\u2019s still mean to laugh at her, Shishi. We are all colleagues after all!\u201d said Zhao Xian with a smile.Gu Shishi paused.Zhao Xian was straight up instigating now.This weightless line made Ling Xiaomei stopped in the middle of her action. Biting down tightly on her lips, she gave Gu Shishi a resentful and shameful look.\u201cMy drawing was too\u2026.\u201d Ling Xiaomei\u2019s cheeks were beet red.Gu Shishi squinted.\u201cYou are right. This drawing by Meimei was quite poorly done.\u201d\u201cHAHA!\u201d Zhao Xian couldn\u2019t help but laughed out loud; her eyes full of sarcasm. \u201cShishi, you must stop! Meimei is feeling embarrassed enough!\u201dEven Ling Xiaomei\u2019s ears were red by now. She quietly gripped the corner of her cloth.But, right when she was about to get up and walk out from being further embarrassed, someone grabbed her wrist suddenly.She turned around and saw Gu Shishi smiled at her with her pretty eyes sparkling.\u201cBut, the reason that Meimei drew it this way was so that she can interact with her students.\u201dLing Xiaomei was baffled when she heard that.Inter-, interaction?\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Zhou Xian looked at both Gu Shishi and Ling Xiaomei dubiously.Gu Shishi took the paint brush from her and walked in front of the easel.\u201cXiaomei mentioned mixed colors earlier. That is a technique that combines multiple colors and one of those key steps was the blending of the colors.\u201dAs she was smiling, Gu Shishi took the paint brush and dipped it into the water.Ling Xiaomei blushed.She was too nervous earlier and failed during this step.But soon, her eyes widened and her mouth turned into the shape of a big O.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(2)The paint brush in Gu Shishi\u2019s hand was obviously the same one that she had used earlier.But, the same brush that was woody and uncooperative in her hand looked like it had gained a mind of its own in Gu Shishi\u2019s hand!The once stiff chrysanthemum, once touched by the water on the tip of the paintbrush, spread out the yellow paint and the petals immediately became much softer and more natural, and the lights and shadows, brights and darks all became apparent!The entire chrysanthemum looked like it had been moved from a dark corner into the grass field outdoors and having baptized by the sun, gleaming sacredly in the wind.Each flower was its own world.That was the line that went through Ling Xiaomei\u2019s head.\u201cShishi\u2026\u201dThat was incredible!Ling Xiaomei\u2019s eyes was filled with admiration.Such a simple change, with nothing but water, and without touching any paint at all, she had turned the situation all the way around!That was some skill indeed!Ling Xiaomei was completely stunned.\u201cTeacher Xiaomei, did I get it right? Your intention was to use this chrysanthemum to emphasize the usage of water to your students, right?\u201d said Gu Shishi as she smiled at her.\u201cWatercolor \u2013 first comes water, then comes color. Even though the first thing one sees was the paint in a drawing, but without water, there will be no drawing at all.\u201d\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d said Ling Xiaomei, her face still beet red.Gu Shishi smiled and descended the stage.\u201cThis was a good example that will, indeed, make a lasting impression!\u201dLing Xiaomei gulped, \u201cOh\u2026.\u201dThe classroom was quiet for quite a while.*Shortly therefore, someone clapped.*\u201cThat was incredible, Xiao Mei!

Lotuses are clear and gentle, and chrysanthemums are refreshing and exuberant. Both of them were quite good.\u201dThe discussion between the experienced employees became animated all of a sudden.Zhao Xian, sitting by one side, gritted her teeth and barely keeping herself from exploding.It\u2019s all fake!That was Gu Shishi openly getting Ling Xiaomei out of a bind! Interaction with the student my ass!And just like that, her drawing had suddenly fallen to the bottom in results!Goddamn it!She was supposed to be the top dog among the new recruits and roll all over them!She was the one who was supposed to crush everyone else, but she failed in all her attempts today!And, whatever happened to that Gu Shishi anyway?She had always thought of Gu Shishi as a piece of unpresentable garbage, but now\u2026Zhao Xian gritted her teeth so tightly that they were about to crush.\u201cShishi, what were you smiling at earlier then?\u201d asked Zhao Xian with a stiff smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I misinterpreted your smile.\u201dOne retreats in order to advance. Zhao Xian wasn\u2019t going to let Gu Shishi off the hook easily!Gu Shishi rolled her eyes elegantly. She didn\u2019t want to deal with this individual at all.Why did she need to tell her what she was smiling about?Zhao Xian\u2019s volume wasn\u2019t soft when she asked that question, and almost everybody else had overheard it and were now looking over, full of curiosity.Even Ling Xiaomei, who was the victim just a minute ago, looked at her with pity in her eyes.\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, of course I wasn\u2019t mocking you,\u201d said Gu Shishi as she wrapped her arm around Ling Xiaomei\u2019s.\u201cMmm\u2026.

Exactly how much free time did this country boy have at hand?Gu Shishi was definitely making this all up to make herself look good!She was probably just going to sneak out, buy herself lunch, and said it was from her fianc\u00e9.Zhao Xian\u2019s eyes beamed and she felt happy inside. She felt that she had it all figured out!\u201cShishi, then we will all go with you to get your lunch! That way we can have a peek at the guy. Don\u2019t worry, we won\u2019t interrupt you~\u201dZhao Xian took a step forward and passionately placed her arm into the crook of Shishi\u2019s arm.As soon as she got close to Gu Shishi, Zhao Xian immediately detected a hint of rose smell that was both refreshing and elegant, but also very feminine at the same time.Zhao Xian was surprised.What brand of perfume was this?She shopped a lot at the designer\u2019s brand counter and had never smelled this before.A nameless brand?Gu Shishi took a step back and subtly pulled her arm out of Zhao Xian\u2019s.\u201cClass is about to start. I am going to go get ready.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d Liu Li, the store manager nodded. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s all stop chitchatting and get ready for work.\u201dZhao Xian\u2019s look froze all of a sudden.The store manager had always been on her side in the past. When had she ever sided with the bottom-of-the-list Gu Shishi?!She grinded her teeth in anger!Soon, the students started to arrive.These were elite sessions, most of them were 1 on 1 or 1 to 3 teacher to student ratio private sessions.As lunch time approached, Zhao Xian never let Gu Shishi out of her sight. She didn\u2019t want to miss her sneaking out to buy her own lunch to fool everyone!But as time ticked away a second at a time, Zhao Xian spaced out a few times and even her students complained about it for a few times. She still didn\u2019t notice any unusual moves from Gu Shishi.Finally, when the classes were over, and after Zhao Xian saw her students out with a smile, she turned around and noticed that Gu Shishi was gone!It has only been a few seconds!\u201cI knew it!\u201dSo, she was looking for the perfect opportunity to sneak out after all!The corners of Zhao Xian\u2019s mouth curved upward.\u201cWhere did Shishi go? Did she go buy her own lunch? Where\u2019s that fianc\u00e9 of hers?\u201dZhao Xian pretended that she just noticed it and purposefully brought it up in the break room in front of everyone.When she was done saying that, she could barely hide that smile on her face.How embarrassed would that Gu Shishi be when everybody caught her in a lie!Nonetheless, she heard a cry coming from Ling Xiaomei before she could hide her smile!\u201cShe\u2019s downstairs!\u201d cried Ling Xiaomei in a gossipy way as she looked out the window from the break room!\u201cShishi was fast! She snuck downstairs already? Eh, eh, eh? Is that the fianc\u00e9?\u201d\u201cWow! It\u2019s a sports car!\u201dThe smile instantly froze on Zhao Xian\u2019s face!\u201cHow\u2019s that possible?? No! No way she could be so fast!!\u201d shouted Zhao Xian mannerlessly.Everybody else quickly gathered around the window.And looked down.Sure enough, a very luxurious silvery grey, aerodynamic and domineering Maserati was parked in a high-keyed fashion in front of the building!***Words from the Author:Boss Huo: Can anyone just surround and watch me whenever they want now?Siyi: \u2026.

Thank you so much!\u201d Smiled Gu Shishi cheerfully.She stood over to one side obediently with her hands to her side and freed up the parking spot for the car.The back side of the Maserati moved in front of her quickly.It was noon, and the sun was above their heads.The backside window, which was shut tightly, reflected the sunlight and all Gu Shishi could see was her own image in the window, but she couldn\u2019t tell if there was someone else sitting inside the car.But, Gu Shishi rubbed her nose. Facing toward the backseat window, she gave it the best 24k gold kiss-up smile.Could the boss be inside the car right now?As the fact that the boss had Siyi went out of his way to deliver her lunch and replenish her blood bar had clearly demonstrated the sincerity in his apology, then she should also be the bigger person and forgive him for his actions from that morning.The boss must be in the backseat!Thinking about that, she squinted her eyes hard and moved her head even close to the backseat window.She even reached out her hands to block the shining sun, hoping she could get rid of the reflection and better see the inside of the car.Inside of the car.Huo Sishen sat in the backseat, reading the documents in his hands with his legs crossed.But his well-defined hand paused in midair and never flipped a page.He looked up slightly with his dark eyes and saw this silly-looking woman with her slightly sweating petite face so close that it was almost touching the car window.On top of that, her mouth was cracked open, smiling like a fool. He couldn\u2019t fathom what she was so happy about.Fool!Huo Sishen pursed his lips.His slender finger pinched a corner of the page. He was a bit too forceful and the veins on his fingers were readily visible.She was startled this morning and ran away like a startled rabbit without looking back.And now\u2026 what was she trying to do now?Outside of the car, the regret on Gu Shishi was clearly visible.Obviously, after much observation, she had finally realized that this was a one-sided window, and there was no way she could see the inside of it.Knock! Knock!So she reached out her hand and knocked on the window.Huo Sishen\u2019s brows furrowed deeply.When there was still no response, she reached out to try again.But, unexpectedly. The car window rolled down all of a sudden!Her index finger immediately knocked straight into the air!At that very minute, her limpid eyes looked into the sharp, black eyes inside the car. Cold and deep, they made her shudder immediately.Like being in the coldest day in the winter, or falling into a cold, bottomless pond, the coldness was bone-chilling.\u201cDo you not know what manners are?\u201d Huo Sishen\u2019s voice was ice cold, spreading its coldness as he talked.Gu Shishi\u2019s limpid eyes flashed with excitement. \u201cMr. Huo!\u201dThe boss was indeed in the car!Gu Shishi had automatically filtered out all of his cold and callous words.The boss always had a bad mouth and refused to show his soft side. He was trying to hide the fact that he was being nice?Aye, the boss was a trying proud and awkward tsundere!Gu Shishi\u2019s mouth curved upward uncontrollably.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was always abusive verbally and told her how she was talentless and spiritless. But as soon as she turned around, he\u2019d took her \u201cawful\u201d work and put it away only to take it out in the middle of the night and laugh in the middle of the night alone in his own room.Her master was also a tsundere! He used his mean words to mask his approval for her!Thinking about this, Gu Shishi\u2019s smile deepened some more.\u201cWhat was it that I said to you that you find so funny?\u201d Huo Sishen\u2019s handsome face dropped.His thinned lips parted slightly and he enunciated each and every single word. The cold air coming from him went down a few more degrees.Nobody had ever been so presumptuous in front of him!\u201cNot\u2026nothing, I\u2019m just happy.\u201dGu Shishi both nodded and shook her head.Huo Sishen squinted his dark eyes and looked straight at the girl in front of him.It hasn\u2019t even been half a day yet, how\u2019s she not afraid of him anymore?It was lunch hour and lots of people walked past their car, going to have lunch in this building.But among everyone that were walking by, she was\u2026 the most eye-catching one.The limpid eyes that were looking at him seemed even brighter than they were this morning, as though they have full taken in the bright summer sun and were now arbitrarily glistening, attracting all of his attention.His thin lips formed into a straight line. With his low, coarse voice, he asked, \u201c\u2026. Happy?\u201d\u201cUh huh!\u201d Gu Shishi nodded violently.The boss might have a mean mouth, but he has a kind heart.It seems the more callous his words were, the better he treated her. Exactly like her master!\u201cThank you for bringing me lunch!\u201d said Gu Shishi with a cheerful grin.Her limpid, almond-shape eyes were genuine-looking, filled with undulating satisfaction.Huo Sishen\u2019s black eyes shrank.He turned away abruptly.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me. It was\u2026 the chef and Siyi\u2019s idea!\u201dGu Shishi paused a little after she heard that, but quickly her smile deepened even more.\u201cOh, oh.\u201dThe chef? The chef could make him deliver her lunch?That excuse\u2026 was full of holes!It looked like the boss was pretty bad at lying!She took a look inside the car and, sure enough, saw the ear of the handsome man turning a light red color. She covered her mouth and grinned.\u201cOh, alright. Please thank Uncle Chef for me then\u2026 ooooo\u2026..\u201dThe window in front of her quickly rolled back up before she could finish her sentence!It almost pinched her nose!The boss\u2026 was so embarrassed that he got mad\u2026Ah, she shouldn\u2019t tease him any further\u2026\u201cAlright then, Mr. Huo. I will see you later~\u201dGu Shishi had no choice but to wave at the window, even though she could no longer see inside the car.Inside the car, Huo Sishen clutched the document tightly and slammed it down onto the seat!\u201cSiyi! What are you waiting for? Toss her the lunch box and let\u2019s get going!\u201dHis voice made Gu Shishi cracked up again.The boss\u2026 has exploded again\u2026She gave Siyi a sympathetic look.\u201cMiss Gu, here\u2019s your lunch box. We doubled your normal amount so you can share with your colleagues.\u201dSiyi quickly walked out of the car and handed her two big lunch boxes respectfully.\u201cThank you so much!\u201dGu Shishi took the lunch boxes from him and couldn\u2019t stop smiling.It was so heavy!Two times the normal amount!Her blood bar was going to shoot up again. Oh, so happy~Siyi nodded, \u201cThen I will drop off\u2026\u201d\u201cShishi, is this your fianc\u00e9?\u201dBefore Siyi could finish his words, an excited and very sarcastic female\u2019s voice came all of a sudden.\u201cAh, you didn\u2019t mention that your fianc\u00e9 was actually a chauffeur who drives for his boss. No wonder he has a car to bring you lunch!\u201dGu Shishi didn\u2019t even need to turn around to know that this sarcastic voice came from Zhao Xian, the trouble-maker who had way too much time on her hand.Gu Shishi looked up and gave Siyi an apologetic look.Turning around, she could see Zhao Xian with her arm in the crook of Store Manager Liu Li\u2019s arm. And, the other colleagues from the art center were around as well.Ling Xiaomei was way in the back. She jogged over to Gu Shishi, out of breath, and whispered to her, \u201cI tried to stop her, but she asked the store manager and everybody else to go to lunch together\u2026\u201cHi, I am Shishi\u2019s colleague.\u201dZhao Xian completely ignored them but just nodded at Siyi, and laughed.\u201cWe are on our way to lunch.

You need to go back to work, right? We don\u2019t want your boss to get upset if he needs to go somewhere and can\u2019t find you.\u201dEvery line sounded normal, yet each word was filled with a sense of superiority, along with the joy of unveiling someone\u2019s lie of someone being engaged to a rich man!What rich fianc\u00e9? She was talking about the chauffeur of a rich man!Zhao Xian\u2019s eyes were filled with prideful exaltation.\u201cThe clothing that you bought for Shishi was so fancy and we were all envious of her!\u201dAs she spoke, Zhao Xian smiled and looked at the designer clothes that Gu Shishi had on.\u201cYou must get great benefits from your boss!\u201dHe was nothing but a chauffeur who drove around!How much could a chauffeur make?She gave it $10,000 \u2013 20,000 max!As much as his boss might value him, at most, he might get a little bit more benefits.As luxurious as the car was, it wasn\u2019t his!Zhao Xian immediately regained her self-confident and turned in looked at Gu Shishi in an prideful manner.Gu Shishi could never be better than her!And, all the women, who were gossiping with them from the art class earlier, all have the \u201cI see\u201d look.The envy from earlier was all gone!Siyi always had dark complexion and it was difficult to tell if there were any color changes on him.But, he was sweating, and a little panicked. He almost had a hard time holding onto the steering wheel.\u201cI\u2026 am not\u2026\u201dHe wasn\u2019t an articulate man, and while these women cutting him off left and right, he couldn\u2019t even form a complete sentence.But quickly, a loud \u201cBANG\u201d came from the backseat of the car!As though something had been thrown onto the ground.All the women surrounding the car paused and looked over.Quickly, the one-sided, backseat window of the Maserati lowered slowly.Zhao Xian\u2019s prideful look froze a little.There was another man in the car.And\u2026 he was young and incredibly handsome!As the window continued to lower, his distinguished, exalted, handsome, and masculine face was there for all to see.He had sword-like brows, dark and profound eyes, and tightly-shut thinned lips. He had on a dark-colored suit jacket, the top button of his white shirt was unbuttoned\u2026. One could almost catch a glimpse his wheat color collarbone\u2026Zhao Xian could hear a BOOM in her head!This was the fianc\u00e9 that Gu Shishi had mentioned? Him?!The cold look, the eminent sense of presence, the elegance in every movement of his\u2026 he was even more eye-catching than a male star coming straight out of a TV show!Zhao Xian\u2019s heart was pounding with jealousy!She could tell right away that this man was of a much higher caliber than the second-generation rich boyfriend that she was finally able to get herself last month!How\u2019s Gu Shishi so lucky?No way! He must be the boss of the fianc\u00e9!But her hope was completely crushed the very next moment.She saw the exceptionally handsome man reached his strong and slender arm out of the car.He opened his thin lips slightly and said, \u201cCome over here.\u201dZhao Xian paused for a second.His voice was so low and magnetic!\u201cZhao Xian, make way for Shishi!\u201d She was suddenly tugged by Ling Xiaomei.Zhao Xian\u2019s body froze all of a sudden!Looking up again, her eyes were filled with shock!She saw Gu Shishi walking up and placed her hand into the palm of the handsome man!And, the handsome man did not fling Gu Shishi\u2019s hand away, but his deep, black eyes gave Zhao Xian a cold look.Just one look was enough to make Zhao Xian shudder from the chilliness!This handsome man quickly turned to look at Gu Shishi.He looked straight at Gu Shishi, who was standing in front of him.

Again, I\u2019m so sorry~\u201dGu Shishi dared not stand right up next to the car window anymore. She didn\u2019t want to cause any more physical discomfort for the boss. She could only wave at Siyi from a few feet away.Huo Sishen was a severe germaphobe. Even the workers at the mansion were required to wear gloves when they work, and even disinfect over 10 times a day.She had been too smug!He probably spoke up in an effort to help her out of the bind in front of her colleagues.Yet she reached out and held his hand\u2026Even just one second would have made him feel awful, but he let her hold his hand in front of her colleagues so as not to embarrass her.Even though his face was so dark he was on the verge of unleashing, but he never yelled at her.\u201cBoss\u2026 was truly a nice man with a kind and soft heart,\u201d mumbled Gu Shishi as she saw the car off with her lunch boxes in her hand.Inside the car, Siyi carefully peeked into the rearview mirror to check on his boss.To his surprise, he found his boss staring at his own right hand with a complicated and profound look.He didn\u2019t use the wet hand wipes that they had in the car or any disinfecting alcohol.Siyi shrank his neck a little and dared not look any further.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Mmhmm!\u201dWith her shaking hand, she pointed at the milk on the dinner tray.Huo Sishen lifted his brows slightly.Gu Shishi gulped.Did the boss buy it?Or was he already unhappy?She gritted her teeth, picked up the milk on the tray, and chugged it all down!Her only option now is to destroy the evidence!And, quickly, a magnetic voice that brought her back to reality rang, \u201cGo back to your room.\u201dHuo Sishen was half frowning.He looked at the rim of milk moustache left on the girl\u2019s upper lip with his dark eyes and paused for a little.\u201cDon\u2019t eat in the hallway. It\u2019s not hygienic.\u201dGu Shishi let out a sigh of relief.\u201cOkay, okay. I will return to my room immediately!\u201dDodged a bullet. She seemed to not have angered the boss today?Oh yay!\u201cLet me bring dinner up to you in a minute~\u201dHuo Sishen\u2019s black eyes paused for a second.He turned around, then stopped again.\u201c\u2026. There\u2019s no need. I have already eaten at work.\u201dGu Shishi let out a cry.It was a trap!Deliver dinner to the boss? The maid was trying to set her up!Luckily, she paid a lot of attention when she was reading the novel, so she was able to recall this particular detail and not be tricked.\u201cWait.\u201d Surprisingly, Huo Sishen was still standing at the door.\u201cEh?\u201d Gu Shishi looked up with the dinner tray still in her hand.Quickly, the man walked inside his room only to walk back out with a familiar-looking suit.FOOM!And a suit jacket fell from the land and landed on one of her shoulders.\u201cThrow it out!\u201dThat was the same jacket that he put on her. He didn\u2019t want it back when she returned it.Then the other day after he fell asleep, she had put it over him\u2026 Now, he wanted it thrown out again?[Ding! Received a gift from the husband: Custom-made high-end suit from the US (black) x1. Original price: $120,475. Used with defects: $2,394.][Remaining Life Balance: 4 days 11 hours.]BAM!And just like that, the room door was slammed shut again.Gu Shishi: \u201c!\u201dHalf a second later, Gu Shishi put her hands on her face and screamed softly, \u201cThe tsundere boss is soooo cute!\u201dHe had increased her blood bar again!With the suit in her left hand and the dinner tray on the right. She grinned like a mouse with oil.Recharged again!\u201cOhhh, this suit\u2026 smells sooo good!\u201dThis treasure just doubled her 2-day remaining life!Gu Shishi was short of burying her face into the suit.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Perhaps she would have full 5 days!What a bummer!Had she known that the boss would want it thrown away and give it to her and that the system would consider that a gift\u2026.She would have had it dry cleaned and ironed so that a wrinkle couldn\u2019t be seen!It didn\u2019t matter how much money she\u2019d have to spend!\u201cFrom now on, I\u2019d treat every single item that belongs to the boss with utmost care!\u201dGu Shishi couldn\u2019t help but mutter.She went into her room with everything. As she was eating, she made a note in her notebook that she always carried around with her.Rule #1: Do not anger the boss. Must appease him.Rule #2: Treat anything that belongs to the boss with great care, much like they are my own life!Once she has finished writing that down, she ate as quickly as a hamster.She ate the entrees and appetizers on the dinner tray.When she was done eating, she called out the system and checked.[Doting of the Male Lead: LV1, 20% progress to LV2Acknowledge of Others: LV1, 50% progress to LV2]Both of the criteria had advanced without her knowing?Gu Shishi squinted and, as she looked carefully, she saw another footnote.\u201cEh, I have received fondness from Huo Sishen 3 times today?

Or perhaps the maids at the mansion?\u201dHaving given that some thought, she didn\u2019t think she had any better options.And then there was that maid earlier.

According to her master, her skills were mature, and she was almost there on the artistic conception level. But she was far from reaching the mastery level.Even up to the point of her master passing away, he still said that his own work was barely enough for appreciation purposes but still not enough to move the viewers. They were of subpar quality!Never mind about her work!Was it really true that when one\u2019s painting skill has reached the mastery level, it would be able to affect the emotions of the viewers?She had grown up listening to stories about a stroke that\u2019s worth 1,000 golds. She was always left longing and enving about that, but at the same time, she felt that it was very exaggerated.At this moment, Gu Shishi didn\u2019t even take a look at that Summer Day Balancing Lotion.Her limpid eyes stared intently at the exchangeable beginner\u2019s level painting skill!\u201cShould I give it a try?\u201dShe only needed one hour to finish a small Chinese ink painting. All that in exchange for 2 hours of life. That\u2019s reasonable?After all, there was a cap to how much life she could store. Once it reached the cap, anything over that was wasted anyway. Might as well exchange it?Gu Shishi was deathly afraid of dying, but she also wanted to give this a try.It\u2019s the level that even her master was never able to achieve; it was a level of legendary achievement that only existed in stories!Plus, she had just received a large amount of recharge from the suit that she had received and was almost at her maximum life cap.Gu Shishi gritted her teeth, stared at the interface for about 5 minutes, and slammed her hand down on the table.\u201cExchange!\u201d\u201cAnd I am going to record the entire process!\u201dIf there were anything unusual during the process, she could also study her video afterward.She wanted to learn this cheat from the system!\u201cIncredible!

They felt that it wasn\u2019t as interesting or valuable as oil painting. It was her goal to introduce Chinese ink painting to more people and to change that misconception.Plus, practicing could be very dry. Regardless of how many audiences she has when she streamed, she would at least have some company.This was how she had gotten into the habit of streaming when she practiced or painted alone, and she had no reason to change that now.She paused again before she started.\u201cHmmm, what kind of a painting would the boss like?\u201dPeople from the ancient times enjoyed nature sceneries.All troubles in one\u2019s everyday life could be relieved by nature.The boss always has this unhappy look on him.If her painting could attract his attention occasionally and improved his mood, that wouldn\u2019t be too bad!She looked around the room, most of the decorations were in black and white.\u201cHmm, I am going to paint a mountain topped with red flowers.

Instead, she could feel the fog around her\u2026. A breeze was blowing through the trees. There was a canopy of green, and the smell of flowers mixed with the fresh soil surrounded her.Gu Shishi opened her eyes, and she was rightfully surprised.What she was seeing in front of her was no longer the wall, but a mountain!Mountain tops towering up and down, stretching out endlessly. The mountain tops were covered in fall maples and they were red like they were on fire! She felt small as she took in the entire majestic and vastness of the scenery.Suddenly a crisp chirp of crane turned her attention to the endless water by the mountain\u2026 A small boat floating by itself in the middle of the river.

She wanted to hug the wind as she was enveloped in the qi of the mountain and the water!Time passed by without her noticing\u2026When she opened her eyes again, Gu Shishi\u2019s eyes beamed. She was back into her room and in front of her drawing paper!She did not take another look at the screen but picked up her paintbrush and started painting on the rice paper.With the ink she created the mountains and with the water, the river.She waved her paintbrush and the boat and the boatman were created\u2026.There were no pauses or hesitation in her movements.[The Red Mountain was completed.][Suggested Retail Price: 300,000 RMB.]SNICKERED.Gu Shishi dropped her paintbrush and looked at her own work in disbelief.Three hundred thousand\u2026 that would be the asking price of a somewhat successful artist.She was just a nobody right now, an art instructor in a small workshop. Three hundred thousand was a ridiculous price.There was no way she could sell it for that price!\u201cEh?\u201dGu Shishi focused again to look at the foothill and paused.At the very moment in time, she seemed to have felt the breeze and heard the chipping of the birds.She wasn\u2019t sure if it was just her, but it almost seemed like the river that she had painted so casually was glistening under the sun!And the majesty of the mountains in front of her was realistic and pressing!She rubbed her eyes a little. When she reopened her eyes, she could still feel the qi of the mountain and the water exuding through the paper.[As Though Assisted by God (Beginner\u2019s Level) 60 minutes consumption was up!]The sound from the system pulled her back to reality.Gu Shishi felt like she had just woken up from a deep, long dream.She looked at her life value; it had decreased by 2 hours.She looked at her cellphone, and only 1 hour had gone by.Which meant to say that the hour that her one-hour realistic experience prior to her painting was all virtual time created by the system?No actual hour had passed in real life?Her face was filled with excitement!This was such a good deal then!The life that she spent in the conversion basically bought her extra time to experience!On top of that, she was able to save the transportation cost and entrance fee!She didn\u2019t even have to pay for modeling fee!Where else could she possibly find such a cooperative crane?!Gu Shishi was so happy that she couldn\u2019t even keep her mouth shut.She turned and looked at her Red Mountain with her limpid eyes.\u201cMaster\u2026 is this the mastery level that you spoke of?\u201dShe almost didn\u2019t want to give this away as a gift to Boss Huo.This was her very first creation!Never mind $300,000, she wouldn\u2019t even want to sell it for $3,000,000!But a painting with such 'special effect\u201d should be able to cheer up the boss some?\u201cNever mind, never mind.

He wouldn\u2019t stand up for her!\u201dZhao Xian frowned.That didn\u2019t seem like the case earlier.He brought lunch for her and had his chauffeur picked her up afterward.Was that just how the rich people would put up the front?Just like star couples always looked like they were in love in front of the camera, even when they were already going through the divorce process?\u201cWell then, dear, what do you have planned for her? Do tell~\u201d Zhao Xian couldn\u2019t help but ask.Luo Zheng snickered.\u201cThese commoner girls all love money.

It was only normal that she didn\u2019t have any viewers.Gu Shishi didn\u2019t concern herself too much with the empirical data from her stream. She was just happy about the outcome of her painting. Plus, she has more that she needed to worry about anyway.She struggled to get up onto her feet and the bags beneath her eyes were worse than they were before. She took a few weak steps forward and felt a splitting headache.Last night, her stomachache almost killed her.She was just about to go look for some pills when the butler miraculously showed up with them at her door.The butler was also going to call the family doctor, but she declined.She thought all she needed was the pills but now, after one-night\u2019s rest, she still felt weak and cold sweat was pouring out of her.[ALERT!][The host has entered into a weakened state.

Finally, she tried very hard to push her neck against Boss Huo\u2019s chest to see if she could straighten herself out\u2026\u201cWhat. Are. You. Doing?\u201d Fire was about to erupt out of Huo Sishen\u2019s black eyes.This daredevil of a woman!She slammed into him early in the morning, and now she was rubbing up against his chest left and right with her cheeks.He looked down and immediately saw her white and soft neck and also the slightly sweet scent coming from her\u2026\u201cI\u2026 I am trying very hard, to get up\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dA second later, Huo Sishen frowned.

I will be more careful next time I walk down the stairs.\u201dGu Shishi finally let out a sigh of relief after she had regained her balance on her feet.She patted herself on her chest.Huo Sishen squinted.But he quickly turned his head and looked away from her.His slender body quickly walked past her and up the stair expressionlessly.\u201cNo next time.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d said Gu Shishi as she stuck her tongue out.\u201cOh, yes. I have a gift\u2026.\u201dBut before she could finish what she was saying, Huo Sishen had already closed the door.\u201cUgh. Guess I will just have to tell him next time,\u201d grumbled Gu Shishi.She turned back around, and her knees buckled immediately. Quickly, she grabbed onto the banister.She had run to the bathroom one too many times yesterday. She barely has enough energy left in her to prop herself up!Quick! Breakfast!\u201cUncle Chef\u2026.\u201dShe was almost out of breath when she finally reached the dining room.She pulled over a chair and quickly sat down.\u201cI don\u2019t want milk today. Just water. Anything else will be okay.\u201dThat iced milk last night almost killed her!\u201cOkay, hang on,\u201d replied Uncle Chef in the most professional tone.While she was waiting, Gu Shishi quickly opened up the system interface that only she could see and checked.[Remaining Life Balance: 3 days 2 minutes.]Oh my god!The trip to the dining room had reduced her life by 11 minutes!She couldn\u2019t handle this 300% decrease rate!\u201cMiss Gu, here\u2019s the breakfast today.\u201d\u201cThe young master had given us his order. He said to give you something simple.\u201dQuickly, Uncle Chef came over with a tray.\u201cOh, thank you.\u201dAs Gu Shishi thanked him, she looked down in front of her and saw a big bowl of plain porridge\u2026 a small plate of crushed dried pork, and a little bit of pickled vegetables!Gu Shishi\u2019s mouth dropped open.Uncle Chef smiled and said, \u201cYoung master had also said that we will need to ration your portions going forward. You can only eat to 80%.\u201d80%?Gu Shishi felt the earth falling from beneath her.Why?!She was burning her life at 300% rate right now!\u201cYou can just leave the dishes there after you are done,\u201d said Uncle Chef before he turned around and left.Gu Shishi was still dumbfounded.She stared at it for a while before she picked up the spoon and stirred the porridge in disbelief.Surely, there was nothing other than rice in the porridge!It was ridiculously pure!She had one bite and she was about to start crying.A spoonful of porridge into her mouth, good fragrance, sticky, soft, and warm. The smell of rice filled the air.It immediately made her stomach felt much better.But not a peep from the system!She flipped through the interface.Yep! Nada!Was it because the system had deemed the porridge so worthless that it wasn\u2019t even worth registering?She gritted her teeth and picked up a chopstick full of dried pork and pickled vegetable\u2026. Still nothing\u2026.Aye, this shallow and vain, damned system!As she was chewing, Gu Shishi was overwhelmed by sadness.\u201cThis was the boss\u2026 trying to be nice to me?\u201dWhen the butler delivered the pills last night, that was when the boss realized she was having gastrointestinal issues?Gu Shishi wasn\u2019t sure what to make of that.It was nice that he cared about her.But\u2026 she wanted to cry!She turned her sadness into appetite and devoured the plain porridge.Right after she had finished and was about to get up, the corners of her mouth twitched again.She quickly threw her arms over her stomach again.\u201cWhat? Again?!\u201dShe dashed into the bathroom on the first floor.Quickly, she walked out on her weakened legs, pale.\u201cMiss Gu, are you alright?\u201d A maid walked past asked, concerned, after seeing the way she looked.Gu Shishi took a deep breath, \u201cI am fine\u2026.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When she walked out again, she was even weaker than she was before.The plain porridge didn\u2019t work!The pills from the butler didn\u2019t work either!The life bar continued to drop like it was nobody\u2019s business!\u201cMiss Gu, would you like to have a seat? You are covered in sweat.\u201dThe maid was too worried to even walk away from her.\u201cOh, by the way, I was looking for you. When you said to the butler last night about getting rid of some used clothes. Are you talking about the one that was on the couch?\u201dThat reminded Gu Shishi, \u201cYes. I don\u2019t know if you have any use of them. Or any way we can donate them. Recycling is fine too. Throwing them away just seems so waste\u2026..\u201dThose clothing were so expensive, and they could still be worn. It would be too wasteful to throw them all out.That\u2019s what she was going to say.But before she could finish the word \u201cwasteful\u201d, she felt coldness behind her back.She turned her head and followed the source of the coldness.She saw Huo Sishen standing there. His face darkened. In his full suit, he stood behind her in her shadow in his full majesty.Next to him stood Siyi.[Huo Sishen\u2019s fondness dropped. Doting of the Male Lead had reached 0!]WTF?!What did she say?\u201cGarbage is to be thrown out! Nobody is allowed to wear it again!\u201dHuo Sishen walked past her and didn\u2019t even look back.He knew it! He knew she was just bullshitting him last night!She wanted to give his suit away to a servant? So another man can wear it?To think that he sent someone to bring her medicines!In his stone cold eyes, there was uncontrollable anger and irony.Gu Shishi didn\u2019t even have a chance to say a word. All she saw was his back when he walked away decisively.At that very moment in time, her desire to live was stronger than anything else!If she let him walk away right now, he would probably never talk to her again. And she would be dead in two days.\u201cWait!\u201dShe stood up quickly and immediately everything spun around her.The weakness of her body exploded like a tsunami.She was just able to grab the corner of the man\u2019s shirt before everything went black, and she started to fall.\u201cMiss Gu!\u201d\u201cGet the doctor! Quick!\u201dAn urgent scream and shouting could be heard. One from a woman, one from a man.It was the maid who was frantic and also Siyi.Gu Shishi hasn\u2019t entirely lost her consciousness, but she was still seeing darkness in front of her eyes and nothing else.She struggled to get up but she failed.Her consciousness began to slip\u2026.\u2026..She didn\u2019t know how much time had passed before she awakened.Next to her, there was a surprised and angry voice.\u201cThis was the dress that she wanted to get rid of?!\u201dA magnetic voice, it\u2019s pace fast and quick, but it still sounded very elegant.\u201cYes, Young Master, this was the dress that Miss Gu had placed on the couch. She said she didn\u2019t need it anymore.\u201dGu Shishi\u2019s mind was still a big jumbo, but she heard the words.What about the skirt?That was Gu Wushuang\u2019s dress. She didn\u2019t want it anymore, and neither did Gu Wushuang. She needed it taken care of\u2026.It cost tens of thousands of dollars. It\u2019s too wasteful to just throw it out.What\u2019s wrong with recycling it?She opened her eyes and could barely make out a handsome man\u2019s side profile and his very defined chin in the dark.It was the boss\u2026..Was she dreaming?How could he be in her room? And sitting next to her bed?\u201cBoss\u2026\u201d she started to talk, her voice barely audible. \u201cHmm, you\u2026. Can you add me on your Wechat?\u201dSince she was dreaming anyway\u2026.

Sadly, my original teddy was no longer here with me\u2026.]Along with that was a picture of her old teddy bear.A little girl standing by the dimmed window on a rainy day, looking into the world outside all alone and confused.In the corner of the room was a giant and tall brown teddy bear. It almost looked like it was reaching out it\u2019s hairy paw towards the little girl.Looking at his cellphone screen, Huo Sishen pursed his lips.The one who never chat with others and never read anything in his friend\u2019s circle, for whatever reasons, had agreed to add her as a friend.Lying on the bed, her tiny and pale face was almost translucent, buried in the white sheets.She looked at him eagerly. Her eyes filled with pitifulness, fragileness, and helplessness. The sparks inside them visibly dimmer than they used to be\u2026 as though it would have gone out with the next breeze.Huo Sishen squeezed his fist together.That year, when his father died in a car accident, or when the old butler died from his illness. That spark in their eyes during their terminal lucidity looked just like that, like it\u2019d go out any minute!He wanted to hang onto it. He wanted them to live on, with him, but he couldn\u2019t hold onto them.Add her on Wechat?The pool of dead water in Huo Sishen\u2019s eyes started to ripple.If only he could have them back. Never mind it was just one request, even if it was 10,000 of them, he would agree to them. He would even trade them with his own life!But, he never had the chance to.Huo Sishen\u2019s look darkened all of a sudden.He looked down, stood up, and started walking out without looking at the girl again, \u201cLet\u2019s go\u201dSiyi nodded and followed, \u201cThe car is already waiting outside.\u201dThey were already late for their 8 AM meeting.But he wouldn\u2019t dare to rush his boss.***Inside the room in the mansion, Gu Shishi was resting on the bed. The doctor had come and given her some medicine and was now administering some IV fluid.She had been spacing out for about half an hour since she had woken up.Staring at her own Wechat contact list, her mouth dropped open and stayed that way for the longest time.She had really added the boss on her Wechat!She really thought she was just dreaming when she asked. She didn\u2019t think he\u2019d agree to that!And his fondness toward her had increased as well\u2026?!She couldn\u2019t figure out what was going on in his mind!She thought he didn\u2019t want anyone bothering him.Maybe the truth was\u2026 he needed love?\u201cI ate too much, but I\u2019m still sick. What was the point of it then?\u201dShe had been eating till she was 120% full every time in order to extend her life.And that iced milk last night was the final straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.If only she knew it\u2019d be so easy to add the boss onto her Wechat, she never would have ate till she was ill.Now that he\u2019s on her Wechat, she could ask for red packets over new year and holidays going forward?Perhaps, the boss was the type who\u2019d just throw away money to his friend\u2019s list whenever he was in a good mood on a regular basis?As she was fantasizing about it all, she couldn\u2019t even feel the IV anymore.She clicked opened the boss\u2019s profile and sent over a message after giving it a little thought.[Thank you so much, Mr. Huo, for having the doctor came for me. QAQ. I am feeling much better now~]She also sent him a red packet for $6.66![Have a nice day! You go, boy!]After she had finished doing all that, she chuckled foolishly at the chat window.Normally during the holiday seasons, she would always return a bigger red packet whenever her friends sent her one.Now that she had sent the boss a mini red packet, he must feel compelled to send her a bigger one in return!\u201cEven the usual bread that he has everyday was over $100, and a jacket that he just tossed over was over tens of thousands\u2026\u201dNow that she had given him a red packet for $6.66, naturally he wouldn\u2019t return one for merely $66.66.Gu Shishi thought she was practically a genius!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(2)As weak as she was right now, her mind had never been clearer.This time she was so sick that she couldn\u2019t even hold up her paintbrush and her life bar was dropping at 300% rate. She was practically puking out blood as she walked. This had made her all the more aware that there was nothing more important than life itself.One would have to be alive in order to eat and drink, and to be able to create \u201cexperience-for-yourself\u2019 paintings, and have her four husbands in her video game.Those would all be gone if she died.Besides, according to the book, the big villain Huo Sishen only has 2 more years to live.She must live till then so she could try and save him.Technically speaking, their lives were tied to each other\u2019s!Taking this logic a step further \u2013 when he was spending money on her, it was the same as him spending money to buy his own life!\u201cI\u2019ll work harder going forward and create one painting a day. Then, I can sell my work and repay him!\u201dAfter she had it all figured out, she didn\u2019t feel bad anymore.She looked down and saw that her red packet had been opened.How exciting was that!The boss had received her mini red packet!Her little heart started to pound!In the novel, everybody thought that Gu Shishi was kicked out of the family when he was still a young man and owned less than 10% of the the Huo\u2019s Corporation with no rights to succeed. But, what they didn\u2019t know was that he had accomplished far more than that outside of the Huo\u2019s long time ago.He was now the hidden boss of HB, the largest social network and search engine. He had also purchased quite a few mines overseas.His personal assets had way exceed that of the Huo\u2019s a long time ago!In the novel, the Huo\u2019s never found out about his assets until after his death, making them feel very regretful about it.And, he hadn\u2019t left a penny of his fortune to them either. He gave away half of them to his employees, and nobody knew what happened to the other half.\u201cAh, let me take a deep breath and be prepared!\u201dShe didn\u2019t want to be shocked by any 5-digit or 6-digit amount red packet!The maximum amount for a red packet was $200. But that\u2019s okay, WeChat came with the ability for direct transfer.Gu Shishi couldn\u2019t stop smiling.But then\u2026 she kept on waiting. Until she almost fell asleep, nothing came over her cellphone.\u201cThat\u2019s impossible!\u201dThe boss received her red packet and then\u2026 that was it?!She refused to believe that!And yet, she waited until Boss Huo returned to the mansion and turned in. Even then, she still hadn\u2019t received anything in return\u2026.\u201cOh\u2026..\u201dNow Gu Shishi didn\u2019t feel so good anymore.She wasn\u2019t someone who gave up easily.Otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t have practiced painting for 20 years.She had IV fluid for three days, and she persistently sent Huo Sishen red packets for 3 days!$6.66, $8.88, $9.99\u2026.Each time she sent over some caring messages as well.Be careful in the rain. Be careful of the high temperature today. Do eat your lunch on time\u2026.And still, she received nothing back from him.Under her extreme distress, she jumped up, grabbed her paintbrush and streamed a \u201cLittle Chicken Fighting for Rice\u201d drawing to let out some steam.With the effect of \u201cAs Though Assisted by God\u201d, the chickens were so lively in her mind they could bounce out any minute!\u201cPeck!\u201d\u201cPeck!\u201d\u201cStingy!\u201d\u201cMiser!\u201dShe scolded as she drew.The entire \u201cchildish\u201d farm life painting was done in one swift stroke!The chickens were vivid and live-like. Even the way that they were eagerly fighting over the rice was about to leap out of the paper.Her streaming screen exploded once again.[King of the Hill: That was amazing? Is this for sale? I\u2019ll pay. Give me your contact info!][King of the Hill: Hey, hey, hey! Where are you? Are you selling the \u201cRed Mountains\u201d from last time as well?][King of the Hill: \u2026.. Shoot! Are you snubbing me? My Wechat\u2019s username is \u2018King of the Hill\u201d, add me pleeeeeeease!]Gu Shishi, naturally, did not see any of those messages as she was very focused on her painting. She just went ahead and turned off the streaming after she was done.She admired her own work for a long time and felt that all the unhappiness in her chest was relieved.She was feeling much better!After three days of sick leave and the gifts of the IV, medicine, bird\u2019s nest soups, abalones, etc, the fall of her life bar has finally been stabilized.She picked up her stuff and finally went back to work.As for the delicate man, who had been waiting for her with flowers for three days straight, he was close to tears when he finally saw her showing up in front of the art studio.\u201cMiss Gu, you are finally here.

(3)At the same time, at the mansion.All the shades were drawn shut once again in the master bedroom.Qin Ruhai, in his white robe, looked at the animal-like man in front of him. The man\u2019s eyes were bright red, and he was obviously in a lot of pain. The murderous look on his patient even made him shuddered.First, it was the girl with her diarrhea and fever so he was called over.He had just put an IV into her before Siyi came over again and said the boss needed him again.Qin Ruhai frowned.Normally, Huo Sishen was still able to control his own emotions as long as other people kept their distance from him.But, once he was stimulated, he\u2019d fall into his frantic memory lane. His rationality would be out the window, and he showed signs of violent tendencies, extreme anxiety, irrationality, and be unable to be placated.The last time this happened was two years ago. After Qin Ruhai had given him some sedatives, he still went on a spree and destroyed all furnishings at home.Word had it that he almost caused his competitor to go out of business as well.\u201cDid you little fianc\u00e9e annoy you?\u201d asked Qin Ruhai as he slowly injected sedatives into his vein.Huo Sishen sat on the couch motionlessly with his mouth closed.His body was cold.The term made him react slightly.Little fianc\u00e9e\u2026Inside his blood-shot, black eyes, the thunderstorm paused for a second.The face that was so pale that it looked translucent suddenly popped up into his mind\u2026She was wrapped up, sent to a place that she had never been before, and was never asked about again.She was so sick that she couldn\u2019t even get out of bed. She passed out from running a fever, and nobody knew about it.Her experience kept reminding him of his past\u2026.His fists that were next to his legs clenched and released, released and clenched.\u201cDidn\u2019t you add her on your Wechat already?\u201d Qin Ruhai forced himself to grumble.\u201cShe\u2019s still young. You can always coach her. Don\u2019t just bottle everything up\u2026.\u201dThat being said, he was quite impressed by the little girl\u2019s courage.He had never seen anyone successfully acquired Devil Huo\u2019s contact information.Qin Ruhai carried on with his one-sided conversation, showing no signs of being tired of it.The biggest issues with Huo Sishen was that he wasn\u2019t able to walk out of his past.He just changed the subject onto the girl in the hope to get him out of his path down his memory lane.Qin Ruhai knew only too well that his condition had nothing to with his fianc\u00e9e.No woman would be able to make him happy or unhappy.Right when he was thinking about the next step of his treatment, he heard a coarse voice.\u201cWhat is this red packet thing?\u201d\u201c???\u201dQin Ruhai was baffled.He looked at the beast-like, lonesome man, who was used to licking his own wound. He rubbed his ears and asked, \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201dHuo Sishen looked down with an unclear look at his cellphone that was right now tossed onto the floor.She had been sending him a red packet every day.Nobody has ever done that before.\u201cIn WeChat, does anyone ever send you red packets?\u201dQin Ruhai\u2019s hand that was over his ears paused. His eyes widened and even his pitch went up by half an octave, \u201cYour little fianc\u00e9e sent you a red packet?!\u201dShe was certainly a ballsy one.What did that mean? Was she blatantly flirting with him?Qin Ruhai looked at the devil man, who looked like a thunder storm that was able to happen. He wanted to tear someone up into pieces at any moment.He thought about it for a second and tried to calmly organize his thoughts.\u201cWell, normally speaking. I\u2019d only send red packets to women that I intend to court \u2026\u201dBut, before he could finish what he was saying, he was kicked out of the room by the big devil himself!\u201cSh*t, I haven\u2019t lit your rose scent aromatic therapy yet \u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Siyi had been with him for years and knew that it\u2019d be a very bad idea to irritate him right now.But, Gu Shishi had given him her work this morning, so he must put it in Huo Sishen\u2019s hand today.This had, somehow, given Siyi an idea that he never had before.Perhaps Miss Gu\u2026 would be able to save his boss. Or at least resolve his psychological issues!\u201cMiss Gu had gone to work. She said to give you her present for you. She also said that I can take it back to her if you don\u2019t like it.\u201dHe forced himself to ignore the cold look that Huo Sishen was given him.That day, Miss Guhad fallen directly into the boss\u2019s arms.The boss didn\u2019t try to move out of her way, nor pushed her away\u2026 in fact, he sat next to her bed after she had lost consciousness and waited for Qin Ruhai to diagnose her and administer her IV fluid before he added her on Wechat with his dark face\u2026.Recalling the details of that day seemed unreal.As he was thinking that, he forced himself to overlook the gloomy atmosphere and the eerie silence of the room and slowly unrolled the painting.He was only halfway through what he was doing when he was interrupted by a lonesome, coarse, and authoritative voice.\u201cGet out!\u201dSiyi paused for a second.After a slight pause, he quickly placed the painting on the coffee table and retreated with his back bowed.Miss Gu, I have done all that I could!Good luck!***Gu Shishi, who was blessed with Siyi\u2019s thoughts, just arrived at the art studio and was looking at the stranger in front of her. She was dumbfounded.The large bundle of flowers in his hand baffled her even more.She turned and tried to walk around him, but he moved his body and blocked her.\u201cMy name is Wu Zhenhao. I\u2019m an owner of a company nearby. I ran into you accidentally when I went to lunch a while ago and fell for you immediately. I just couldn\u2019t help myself.\u201dHe had on a full suit and his hair was nicely styled with hair gel.He directly professed his fondness for her and, at the same time, mentioned the fact that he was an elite with his own company.Wu Zhenhao\u2019s eyes beamed with the light of confidence.There was even a hint of satisfaction on his face!That\u2019s right, satisfaction.This gig that he\u2019s got was simple and high paying.He just had to pretend to be an elite and tricked this Gu Shishi to go on a date with him.Then, all there was left to do was to take some intimate pictures of them together and give them to his employer.His employer started the price at $100,000!If the quality of the pictures were good, he\u2019d pay him even more.Now that he has met her in person \u2013 she was a pretty quality girl as well!She definitely stood out among the girls in the art studio.She had on a silk spinned little white dress with grass green lining. It was light but also showed the curves of her bust nicely. The poofy skirt covered just above her knees and showed off perfectly her white and shapely calves.Around her waist, there was a light green belt and made her waist seemed even more slender than it was and left one a lot of room for imagination\u2026He looked again at her white and smooth face. It was a hot day, but her face was still flawless. It was white and smooth like snow and looked so pinchable. One look at her was enough to make him feel very excited and high spirited.He must complete this gig!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(2)But first, he wanted to have some fun.As he was thinking that, Wu Zhenhao\u2019s smile thickened around his mouth.He has the reputation of a player to keep!He would be able to conquer this girl in one week max!\u201cMiss Gu, I know this was very abrupt, but when you were out the last few days, it really made me realize how important you are to me.\u201dAs he talked, he lifted his hand and intentionally twirled the diamond watch on his hand.He understood how girls her age were very materialistic and had spent a lot of time studying how wealthy men dressed and behaved.And now, he was truly a wealthy man from top to bottom.The kind that all girls would want to be with!Wu Zhenhao\u2019s little white face exuded a casually attractive aura.\u201cI\u2019d like to go out with you\u2026\u201dHe handed over the large bundle of flower that was actually heavy for a normal girl.A shocking temptation along with genuine words!But Wu Zhenhao\u2019s confident look was stunned silent by a earth-shattering sneeze.\u201cACHOO! AHHH CCHOOOO!\u201dWith a groan, tears and snorts flew out of Gu Shishi, and she covered her nose painfully.Before long, her eyes were completely teared up.This body was allergic to flowers.It was exactly the same as how she was before.Whenever she wanted to observe and draw the nature and got close to a sea of flowers, she\u2019d sneeze nonstop.And now, the bundle of flowers in front of her was making her sneeze.She covered her nose and immediately squeezed past him.\u201cPardon me. Excuse me. Thank you! ACHOO!\u201dShe practically ran away at light speed!There was no way she was going to accept the bundle of flowers.With the flowers still in his hands, Wu Zhenhao\u2019s smile froze on his face.But he reacted quickly and blocked her way again.This time he fished out a handkerchief from the pocket of his suit.\u201cUse mine.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know the flowers would have that effect on you. I will throw it away right away!\u201dThe wealthy don\u2019t use tissues.Wu Zhenhao was so proud of how thorough his preparation was.He handed her his handkerchief, turned, took a few large steps away and forcefully tossed away the pricey bundle of flowers.He was able to play the role and showed the girl how much he cared at the same time.Tsk!Piece of cake!\u201cMiss Gu\u2026.\u201dHe turned around, smiling.And, Gu Shishi was nowhere to be seen.The corners of Wu Zhenhao\u2019s mouth twitched.Where did she go?What was wrong with that woman?All the girls started to chattered in the classroom.\u201cShihi, you are back? How are you feeling?\u201d\u201cWho was that outside? He had been waiting for you for days~\u201d\u201cAnd he brought with him a different bundle of flowers every day!\u201dWu Zhenhao looked better all over again.That\u2019s right.Even though he knew she would be out for three days, he still came all three days to wait for her with an eager look on him.What woman didn\u2019t like romance?But quickly, a very calm statement completely wiped away all of his triumph.\u201cI don\u2019t know him. I am already engaged.\u201dGu Shishi even sounded very troubled.\u201cHmm. I\u2019ll go clarify it with him right now.\u201dWu Zhenhao\u2019s brows twitched.It was precisely because she was engaged that his employer wants proof that she was being unfaithful. This was the only reason he was being paid so much.Wu Zhenhao weighed his options quickly. With persistent genuineness, he walked inside the classroom.\u201cMiss Gu, please give me another chance! I will prove to you that I am as good as any other men. My love for you is no less than anyone else\u2019s.\u201dAs he was speaking, he pulled out a gold-colored VVIP bank card.\u201cWith the exception of real estate and my company, all my assets are in this account.\u201d\u201cAs long as you would be my girlfriend, I will give you the pin number right now.\u201dMany people inside the classroom gasped audibly.This was too much like a drama!No, even more dramatic than a drama!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(3)Zhao Xian, sitting inside the classroom, couldn\u2019t help but smile at Luo Zheng, her boyfriend.Having heard that Gu Shishi would be returning today, Luo Zheng came purposefully to audit the class today.And now, the two of them exchanged a look. Both of them were smilinfg triumphantly.This was definitely worth the 3-day wait!The con artist that they have found was an expert at this!The very first time Zhao Xian met Wu Zhenhao, she was almost shocked by all the designer brands that he had along with his graceful elegance.He knew how to show off his wealth and how to grab the hearts of materialistic girls.Gu Shishi, I wanted to see how you were going to play this off!She had probably already fallen hard for the con artist right about now.Zhao Xian smiled with anticipation.But quickly, a crisp voice rang. \u201cI don\u2019t accept. Please take it back.\u201dGu Shishi didn\u2019t even blink.Even her voice was calm and now the entire art studio was quiet.Even Zhao Xian and Luo Zheng were surprised.But Wu Zhentao wasn\u2019t the kind who\u2019d give up easily.He quickly wiped away his shocked look and lowered his head.\u201cI am sorry.\u201dHe put away his bank card as though regretfully.\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to offend you. You are a good girl. I shouldn\u2019t have rushed like that.\u201dMade sense.This was the first time they\u2019ve met, and he wanted to give her so much money in front of everyone. She wouldn\u2019t want to ruin her own reputation.\u201cThen, what do you like? I will buy them for you in the future. Skin care products? Jewelries? Shoes? Purses?\u201dWu Zhenhao looked up and smiled, lifting up his chin again full of pride.His actions captured many envious looks from other girls in the classroom.Again, unexpectedly, he was interrupted before he finished talking!\u201cI don\u2019t need money, skin care products, jewelries, shoes, or purses\u2026 definitely not a boyfriend. Thank you for your appreciation but, pardon me, I must start working,\u201d said Gu Shishi swiftly as she covered her nose with a tissue.As she talked, she backed away from him like he was a poisonous snake or something.Wu Zhenhao paused for a second.She seemed to be repulsed by him.Why was that?That was impossible!Was she playing hard to get?What kind of women couldn\u2019t be moved by money? Okay, even if she didn\u2019t need money, she must need love, right?What was her problem?!Wu Zhenhao couldn\u2019t help but looked over at Gu Shishi and his inquisitive look was almost burned by what he saw!Looking carefully, there seemed to be a very light print of \u201cDior\u201d on her little white dress?!He looked again at her belt, the buckle was Chanel\u2019s double C\u2019s?! He looked further down and that inconspicuous pair of little white shoes seemed to have the word \u201cFendi\u201d on the side\u2026Her outfit cost at least $30,000?!Now Wu Zhenhao was truly dumbfounded!He looked again carefully and now he saw the rose gold loop with white ceramic pendant glittering around her neck.His chest tightened right away!Was that the Italian brand BVLGARI\u2019s classic necklace?!He seemed to remember that necklace being $20,000!What was going on here?Wasn\u2019t she supposed to be a very materialistic woman according to his employer?But she was already wearing designer brands from head to toe?!\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. Wu. I don\u2019t think we are right for each other.\u201dSeeing that he wasn\u2019t responding, Gu Shishi repeated her rejection one more time.She didn\u2019t even need to think about it.Since he chose to block her and express his fondness for her in such a public way, naturally she, too, would want to clarify her stance in front of everyone.Was he kidding? He thought she was such a materialistic woman?He was proposing a relationship that was based on money. He might as well be throwing money at her face.How could she possibly accept that?!Unless\u2026 hmm\u2026 unless it was the boss, then she\u2019d \u2026 agree to it.After all, he held her life over her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(4)Gu Shishi even went behind Ling Xiaomei to not show her face again as said, \u201cI\u2019m engaged. I wouldn\u2019t want anything that could potentially cause a rift between my fiance and I. .Have a nice day.\u201dIf the boss found out and got upset at her, she wouldn\u2019t be able to handle that outcome.Wu Zhenhao\u2019s mouth dropped open and didn\u2019t know what else to say.Her entire outfit probably cost around $50,000 \u2013 $60,000 from his rough estimates.She couldn\u2019t possibly make enough at this little art studio for any of these designer brand items, so naturally all these were from her fianc\u00e9.If he was in her shoes, he would never let this fianc\u00e9 go either. Unless she was an idiot!But even so, he still forced a handsome smile and said, \u201cThen I will buy some lessons\u2026\u201dHe had decided to move her with his love.But in just a moment\u2019s time, Gu Shishi waved her hand and ran away as those someone lit a fire behind her butt.\u201cLiu-jie, which students should I help out during this session?\u201dWu Zhenhao was thoroughly embarrassed.But, still, he didn\u2019t leave.The money that his employer paid him was his main source of income.He swallowed his pride and went to buy some lessons.However, Gu Shishi stayed away from him purposefully all afternoon long. Store manager Liu Li was on her side as well. She asked Liu Xiaomei to take Wu Zhenhao to the separate room for elite students.Wu Zhenhao listened to these very confusing drawing techniques that he couldn\u2019t make any sense out of all afternoon, but never had any opportunity to get close to Gu Shishi.Zhao Xian, watching from the sideline, was so mad that she almost bit through her lips.\u201cI am sure she was just faking it\u2026.\u201dLuo Zheng, on the other hand, put down the paintbrush in his hand and looked at Gu Shishi with more interest than before.Of course he could tell the cost of Gu Shishi\u2019s outfit, but in the eyes of a SGR, that was really nothing.\u201cIt looks like the Gu\u2019s are pretty nice to her. But for someone who just isn\u2019t presentable to begin with, so what if they treated her nicely for a day or two?\u201d\u201cThe Gu\u2019s?\u201dZhao Xian was confused.Luo Zheng smiled but did not elaborate for her.He turned around and raised his hand at Gu Shishi who was teaching nearby.\u201cThis instructor, can you please take a look at my painting?\u201dHe was born into wealth and very different from a fake like Wu Zhenhao.What he wore wasn\u2019t just about the brand, but more about how to match them and also the event that he was attending.He even used different the cologne in the daytime versus night time in order to be perfect for the situation.Every move of his exuded the aura of someone of power. That alone would allow him to instankill the ignorant girl.On top of that, he has been raised as an upperclassman and had been taking lessons on arts and art appreciation since he was just a child.That wasn\u2019t someone who had only been taking lessons for a couple of years could rival.\u201cWhat do you think of my peony?\u201dLuo Zheng ignored Zhao Xian\u2019s astonishment and thrusted his painting in front of Gu Shishi.His Chinese painting was actually quite well known among the rich kids.Especially when he demonstrated it when he was courting a girl; that worked every time!All being said, he was a wealthy, talented, and good looking SGR; what kind of woman could resist someone like him?Luo Zheng reached out his arm and casually trapped Gu Shishi at the corner of the desk.His CEO authoritativeness exuding at maximum level!The con artist wasn\u2019t doing a good enough job so now he has to take matters into his own hands and force her to show her true colors!A condescending smile crept up of Luo Zheng\u2019s face.All women like bad boys.\u201cPlease opine on my work, Instructor Gu.\u201dHe lowered his voice some, making it sound deeper and sexier.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(5)When his breath hit Gu Shishi on her face, she couldn\u2019t help but paused for a second.She was just about to frown when she caught sight of the painting that he had thrusted in front of her.What a painting of a fiery peony!The bright red color was intense, dazzling, and every petal was eye catching!Even though it was a painting with watercolor, it has a hint of Chinese ink painting\u2019s majesty within it.She couldn\u2019t help but give the fool in front of her another look.She wasn\u2019t sure why he skipped over Zhao Xian to ask her; nor did she know why the fool had to corner her for that\u2026And he was so close\u2026 and breathed on her\u2026But, she acknowledged his painting nonetheless.\u201cPretty good.\u201dAs a paying instructor of the art studio, Gu Shishi would dish out praises when they were called for.Just in case she didn\u2019t get her point across verbally, she even nodded to emphasize her point.\u201cYour skill level exceeded that of Zhao Xian, your instructor. Your choice of colors are bold and the artistic conception is quite good as well.\u201dShe even used a comparison to show how much she acknowledge his ability.\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201dHer words, however, almost made Zhao Xian spit out blood.Was she insulting her right in front of her own boyfriend and all the students and instructors of the art studio?!Gu Shishi gave her an oops-I-accidentally-slipped-and-told-the-truth look, which made Zhao Xian even more livid.She was just about to argue with her but the very next minute, her face was shocked pale by Luo Zheng\u2019s laugh.Luo Zheng was very pleased by Gu Shishi\u2019s remark and wasn\u2019t concerned about Zhao Xian\u2019s feeling at all.\u201cMiss Gu, you\u2019ve got good eyes.\u201dHe had no respect for this little art studio at all!They were but a bunch of half-assed, mass trained technicians.He himself, on the other hand, had been learning from a master-level artist since he was a child.\u201cYou are exactly right; my painting skill is superior.\u201d\u201cThen, Miss Gu. Anything else you would like to point out about my painting?\u201dLuo Zheng acted like nobody else was there and looked deeply at Gu Shishi.His tone rose up toward the end, sounding very flirty.Zhao Xian\u2019s entire body was shaking.She was his girlfriend!Was he hitting on another woman right in front of her? And using the exact same trick no less?!How many women had he courted using the exact same trick?!Even though she knew his intention behind hitting on Gu Shishi, she was still livid.She had to grip her fingers to not say anything.But she stared at Gu Shishi lethally.Gu Shishi, on the other hand, took another look at the painting.There was no emotions or shyness in her look. In fact, really repulsed, she took a small step backward.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say opinion.\u201dLuo Zheng was offended by her taking a step backward.But what she said next made his face drop even more!\u201cYour foundations are still lacking. So, as much as you an artistic conception, your paintbrush wasn\u2019t able to fully express that. There is still room for improvement. But no worries, it\u2019s still pretty when you hang it up. Just don\u2019t look too closely.\u201dAs she was talking, Gu Shishi gestured at a farther wall inside the art studio.\u201cFrame it, and hang it up on the wall.\u201dA shock flashed past Luo Zheng\u2019s eyes which was quickly replaced with anger.With a loud \u201cBANG!\u201d, his watch smacked the corner of the table.A very disruptive sound was made.When he looked over at the wall she was pointing at, his face darkened even more.Gu Shishi was pointing at the wall that was farthest away from them, at least 6-7 meters away.Was she suggesting that his painting was so bad it shouldn\u2019t even be looked at?Huang Zhong, his painting master, said the exact same thing about him back in the days.At the time, he had been infuriated by his words and ripped the painting up on the spot!He never went back to his lessons with Huang Zhong again!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(6)\u201cI am lacking in my foundation?\u201dThat was what Luo Zheng hated to hear the most.That was the sore spot inside him.Gu Shishi merely smiled lightly and pointed at the peonies on his paper.The flowers were all squished together like a sea of fire and exude a pressing aura.But they were fundamentally wrong.\u201cThe leaves seem to be easy, but they are difficult to master. First you must experience it and observe them in nature. The leaves grow in groups of 3-5 in various sizes; the petals have layers, some are the primary ones, others are secondary\u2026.\u201cYou started drawing before you have that figured out, so when you looked at it closely, all the discrepancies became very obvious.\u201cPlus, we are talking about the techniques of hook, lift, pause, and file in painting and the way you handle them is not precise enough. While you don\u2019t have to focus on the nitty gritty details when it comes to artistic conception, that\u2019s not to say to just rush through everything\u2026\u201cYou must use both your eyes and your hand.\u201d\u201cStarting today, practice using your paint brush for an hour a day, observing flowers for 30 mins. In three-months\u2019 time, your peonies would go up an entire level.\u201dUsing her fingers, Gu Shishi gestured the second closest wall from them.\u201cThen we will be able to look at it from 3-5 meters.\u201dLuo Zheng\u2019s face turned from dark to pale, then from pale to dark.She said the exact same thing as Old Man Huang.This was about artistic conception, not sketching, but they all wanted him to go observe real flowers!This is painting, not calligraphy, but they wanted him to practice using his paintbrush!What a hassle!He didn\u2019t want to listen to any of these words back then.But this woman said the exact same thing today.\u201cDo you know Huang Zhong? What is your relationship with him?\u201dLuo Zheng squinted his eyes in a threatening way.\u201cEh? I don\u2019t know who that is.\u201dGu Shishi searched her memories but nothing came up.He was probably never mentioned in the book.\u201cPardon me. I have other students to tend to. Keep at it, you will get there.\u201dGu Shishi thought about it for a second and finally gave him an encouraging smile.This was an art school after all.Luo Zheng gritted his teeth so hard he could crush them.His purpose was to trick her, but instead, he got a lecture from her straight to his face!Have him practice for three months, then his work could be looked at from 5 meters away?!His face was burning up.He stood up abruptly.\u201cDear, just ignore\u2026.\u201dZhao Xian squeezed his hand.\u201cGo away!\u201dLuo Zheng threw her hand away in anger.Zhao Xian was so angry she was shaking.Luo Zheng, too, was gritting his teeth.\u201cAwesome. Just awesome. Gu Shishi, then you paint one to show me!\u201d\u201cEh? You know my name?\u201dGu Shishi paused for a second.Then she shook her head without thinking.\u201cI am not your instructor, and I have other students to tend to.\u201dHaving said that, she didn\u2019t care who he was but turned and walked to a student near her to address his questions.Luo Zheng slammed his palm forcefully down on the table.Then he walked with large steps to Store Manager Liu Li.\u201cI want to take Gu Shishi\u2019s class! Sign me up now!\u201dGu Shishi turned and looked at him in surprise.Luo Zheng snickered, \u201cHow much is a lesson with her? $300? I will take all of her time this month!\u201dGu Shishi didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be that persistent.Luo Zheng was quickly brought in front of Gu Shishi by the helpless-looking shop manager.\u201cShishi, starting at 3 PM, he will be your student.\u201dLuo Zheng laughed out loud.One could see the mockery in his eyes.Three o\u2019clock came quickly. Even though Zhao Xian had almost ripped the paper in front of her into pieces, there was nothing she could do to stop him from taking Gu Shishi\u2019s lessons.\u201cYou are quite persistent,\u201d praised Gu Shishi with a smile.Luo Zheng snickered with his eyes squinted and threw the paintbrush over, \u201cNow, you draw and show me!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Here, like this.\u201d Gu Shishi stopped after that one stroke.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me.

You or me?\u201dLuo Zheng was so angry that his face was crooked.\u201cDid I pay to listen to your bullshit?\u201d\u201cAs a matter of fact, yes. If you want to cancel the lesson, you can talk to our store manager.\u201dLuo Zheng\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cYou want to file a complaint? That\u2019s fine too. We can assign a different instructor for you.\u201dLuo Zheng was so angry that he didn\u2019t even know what to say. He couldn\u2019t even remember the last time he was so angry. He was so mad he wanted to cuss her out.\u201cYou better get started. We don\u2019t refund for time spent.\u201dLuo Zheng almost passed out from being so angry.After three hundred lifts, it was three hundred hooks. Then, it was a whole lesson of observing flowers, and flowers from\u2026. Baidu no less.He was about to snap when it was time for Gu Shishi to go home.\u201cSee you tomorrow.If you are not going to be here tomorrow, don\u2019t forget to keep up with your practice at home. Otherwise, all your hard work today would go to waste.\u201dLuo Zheng thought he was going to go insane!Happily, Gu Shishi picked up her purse and left with Ling Xiaomei.After they have stepped out of the art student, Ling Xiaomei gave her a very respectful look.\u201cShishi, you are so brave. I was scared shitless. Why wouldn\u2019t you draw for him anyway?\u201dGu Shishi shrugged. Even if she had drawn him peonies, he wouldn\u2019t be able to learn anything from it. Besides, why would she want to?She turned around and saw Wu Zhenhao still following them. He was so persistent and hadn\u2019t given up on \u201ccourting\u201d her yet.This man came out of nowhere. She searched through the original owner\u2019s memory repeatedly and there was no mention of this man at all. Plus, ever since he arrived in the afternoon, Zhao Xian had a very curious look on her, as though she was waiting for her to embarrass herself.In addition, Zhao Xian seemed to be quite familiar with Luo Zheng, and Luo Zheng knew her name was Gu Shishi. Either way you look at it, they were up to no good.Her guts told her that he might have something to do with Wu Zhenhao\u2019s courting.Long story short, she couldn\u2019t be bothered to draw for someone who was there to pick on her.Besides, he offered $300/lesson and wanted her to paint a peony? That was quite offensive; her work wasn\u2019t that cheap. Her work was worth tens of thousands minimum, okay?\u201cHehe, did you see how angry he got?\u201d Ling Xiaomei giggled. \u201cEven his paintbrush was shaking at the end.\u201d\u201cYup, his foundation was very lacking and he wasn\u2019t holding the brush probably. His muscles were probably sore,\u201d said Gu Shishi from personal experience.Lo and behold, the angry Luo Zheng just happened to walk passed them, \u201c\u2026..\u201dSh*t! His wrist started to hurt all of a sudden!\u201cMiss Gu, let me give you a ride home.\u201d Wu Zhenhao was in a different room earlier and had no idea what took place inside the classroom. Now that they were out, he thought Luo Zheng was upset because he had failed in his assignment. He immediately ran after Gu Shishi. He couldn\u2019t ruin this gig and make his employer unhappy.\u201cMy car is parked in the garage downstairs. Wait for me here.\u201d Wu Zhenhao immediately pressed a button on his key. With a \u201cbeep\u201d, the front lights of a new model of BMW convertible lit up.Wu Zhenhao had a proud look on him. He paid $500 to rent it and he needed to return it quickly, but it\u2019s necessary to have that to attract a materialistic girl.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This was the newest model that just came out this year, not even very many SGR have this.He was happy for all one second before another beeping sound came from nearby.He turned and looked. There was a Rolls-Royce Phantom slowly driving next to him. Wu Zhenhao was so envious his jaw almost hit the ground.If this was the extended wheelbase edition, it would cost over $9 million!Compared with this, his BMW was as low as the dirt!\u201cMeimei, you get into the car first. I have already told the chauffeur that we will drop you off on our way,\u201d said Gu Shishi quickly.Her soft and crisp voice hit Wu Zhenhao like a slap on this face.The very next second, he could do nothing but watch Gu Shishi and her female colleague stepped into this super awesome and money-burning Phantom.\u201cThank you, Shishi. Eh? This looks different than the one from before.

Perfect timing to take the two of you back.\u201dThey have more than one fancy car at home!Wu Zhenhao felt pain on his cheeks!He tried to show off his wealth in front of Gu Shishi with a fake bankcard, a BMW, and a bundle of flowers?She has a chauffeur, a fancy car, and an entire outfit of designer brand clothes. What else did she need?Nothing!Wu Zhenhao was about to start crying.What a sh*tty gig!Even Luo Zheng has a complicated look on him, \u201cThat was Huo Sishen\u2019s chauffeur? She really was \u2026 staying at his place?\u201dRumor had it that he was cursed and had already lost two fiancees.Neither one of them lived past 3 days!\u201cJust how long would she live?\u201dLuo Zheng squinted his eyes.He promised to help out his little cousin and teach Gu Shishi a lesson, but if she only has a few days left to live, then why should he bother?Wasn\u2019t this a waste of his time?Thinking about that, Luo Zheng\u2019s chest felt nauseated again.Sh*t! And his wrist hurt too!\u201cWhat about how much longer to live?\u201d Zhao Xian blinked.\u201cShut up!\u201dLuo Zheng was so irritated that he couldn\u2019t even bear looking at Zhao Xian.\u201cYou mind your own business! I need to go back to work. You go home by yourself!\u201d He took off right after he said that.Zhao Xian stomped her feet angrily.Wu Zhenhao, too, was speechless. What was the point of spitting blood on the ground now? What a perfect waste of his $500 rental for the BMW.What the hell!***When Gu Shishi arrived home, it wasn\u2019t even 8 PM yet, and it was already pitch black inside the mansion.All the servants had already returned to their own rooms. Huo Sishen needed absolute silence and darkness at night in order to sleep.Right now, she was the only one walking around, and it was a little creepy.With a nightlight in the hallway, the dim light did not make her feel any better but worse. She quickened her steps.She was afraid of the dark.Extremely so.She even needed to have some distance light on when she went to bed at night.When she was a kid, her master loved telling her all sorts of stories about ghosts and demons, and now she was always scared.Especially when she was alone at night.She never left the house after 9 PM, not even to go out and have fun in the city.Even though it was only 8 PM, this was a standalone mansion with nothing else around it.From the first to the second floor, it was so empty that all that could be heard was her own footsteps. The weak lights dragged her shadow out\u2026.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(9)Out of the blue, right when she was about to pass the living room, a low and sandy voice that sounded from afar came coldly.\u201cCome over here.\u201dGu Shishi jumped and almost dropped down onto her knees.With a groan, she hugged her own weak and helpless self.A screeching sound like some sharp instrument was dragged across a glass surface gave her goosebumps!Gu Shishi wanted to take a step back to turn around and run away.But, a cold hand suddenly grabbed onto her wrist!\u201cOw!\u201d Gu Shishi couldn\u2019t help but scream out loud.\u201cShut up!\u201d Came the coarse voice again.Gu Shishi shuddered and look in the direction of the voice with her teeth gritted. After a short while, she asked in a shaky voice, \u201cBo\u2026 boss?\u201dUnder the dim light, she was finally able to see a dark shadow sitting on the couch next to her.Deep and cold eyes looked straight at her, making her shuddered again.Was that Huo Sishen?Gu Shishi gulped.Yet, the other person didn\u2019t move, or say anything.The living room was ridiculously quiet.Gu Shishi wanted to cry.Shivering, she fished out her cell phone and turn on the flashlight and aimed the beam of light decisively toward the dark shadow on the couch that she couldn\u2019t make out.A beam of strong light landed on the man on the couch.He had on a blue robe with a sash tied loosely around his waist. As though he was being very impatient, his top was not straightened out and she could see a patch of his wheat color skin along with a hint of his defined muscles.Gu Shishi pursed her lips, and her hands shuddered.Her sight followed the light up and quickly saw a stone-cold and handsome face.The chilly black eyes squinted into a line from the bright light; the disgruntledness in them looked like a thousand knives that wanted to have her killed in the next instant.\u201cOh, ha ha ha\u2026\u201d Gu Shishi gulped and moved her cellphone away as she laughed dryly.\u201cBoss, oh, I mean, Mr. Huo. It\u2019s you\u2026 you are still up\u2026 ha ha.\u201dHuo Sishen squinted his eyes.Gu Shishi wanted to wave at him and realized that he was still gripping onto her right wrist.She blinked.What was he doing that for?\u201cYou\u2019re looking for me?\u201dGu Shishi was baffled.The boss told her to go over to him. Now he wouldn\u2019t let go of her but he also wasn\u2019t saying anything. What was going on?Eh\u2026 was he being a tsundere again?Whatever happened to him being germophobic?\u201cEh, you got the painting that I asked Siyi to give to you this morning?\u201dAs she was talking, she stealthily opened up the system\u2019s interface.She quickly checked the details under Doting of the Male Lead.Oh darn!The level of doting was going up!Visibly so.

Like a devil in deep sleep, his look turned nice and soft\u2026.She opened her mouth.He felt asleep again?Gu Shishi didn\u2019t know what to make of that.She was just about to walk away and a deep voice rang from behind him.\u201cSit down.\u201dOh, he wasn\u2019t asleep yet.Gu Shishi turned her head.She noticed that he didn\u2019t open his eyes but his arm moved, as though he was adjusting himself to find a more comfortable position to fall asleep.Gu Shishi started to sweat.He wanted her to sleep\u2026.

One would have to be very, very close to her in order to smell it.And every time, it was able to relax his nerves and alleviate his throbbing brain.Ever since that day, he had people looked for rose fragrance oil all over and had collected over 100 different kinds.But, he tested them all out, and none of them could help him fall asleep.The fragrance on her was very unique\u2026. But he was not able to find anything similar.As Huo Sishen was thinking, he couldn\u2019t help but frown.And yet, as he was being enveloped by this elegant and sweet rose smell, his ability to think began to deteriorate.He hadn\u2019t felt sleepy in days and his splitting headache, all started to soften as soon as she was nearby\u2026Her scent worked better than any type of medicine?As he was relaxed, he started thinking about her painting where maple leaves had turned the mountain red.That was a gift from her to him.When was the last time he received a gift? He couldn\u2019t even recall.Even since he had moved into the little cabin next to the Huo\u2019s main residence when he was a child, nobody from his family ever brought up his birthday again.As an adult, over the holidays, he\u2019d send the staff from the mansion away and have them go home while he stayed and observe the sunrise and sunset by himself.Gifts, red pockets\u2026. He had already forgotten what it was like when he received them.Besides, he didn\u2019t need any of those things!Huo Sishen pursed his lips and tightened his hands into balls.Before he slipped off into a deep sleep, he struggled to open his eyes and take one more look at the girl sitting next to him.Her little face that looked like a small flower bud, her limpid eyes stared intently at him without blinking\u2026 she had overlapped with that tender little girl riding on the boat in her painting\u2026The corners of Huo Sishen\u2019s mouth curved upward.Perhaps, he hadn\u2019t slept for too long, which was why he started to hallucinate.Earlier that day, in the afternoon, he had been looking at the painting. He felt that maple leaves waving back and forth with the wind. He could also hear the rustling sound coming from all over the mountain. And he could also hear the lapping of the water, along with the crisp laughter of the little girl and the chirping of the crane.The breeze came at him from straight ahead. He looked down and thought he saw himself rowing the boat amidst the river\u2026Her painting skill was quite acceptable.Thinking of that, Huo Sishen closed his eyes again.The rose fragrance filled his nose and seemed to be mixed with the fresh soil smell in the mountain. The couch felt like the little boat and rocked back and forth slightly in the evening\u2026[Sleep Assistance Activated Successfully!]Gu Shishi didn\u2019t know what she should make out of the system\u2019s indicator.She didn\u2019t need the system to remind her. All she needed to do was to look at the boss\u2019s groggy eyes earlier plus his deep and steady breathing now to know that he had fallen asleep.Plus, before the boss fell asleep, the oh-my-god-i-am-so-tired-I-am-going-to-fall-asleep-right-now look was written all over his face. But, for some reason, he still struggled to open his eyes and look at her through his tired and squinted eyes\u2026. Oh, the boss was quite cute before he fell asleep!Gu Shishi covered her mouth and giggled.She didn\u2019t expect the mean boss to be as childish as a big kid.He was just like her when she stayed up late playing on her cellphone. She would be so tired that she could barely keep her eyes open.

That must be it.Gu Shishi was very pleased by her own imagination.She had been taking and taking from him and had been feeling useless. Now, she was finally able to repay him!As Gu Shishi was cheering for herself, she noticed another fine print on the system\u2019s interface.[After 100 uses of the effect, mid level painting skill will be unlocked.]\u201cMid level?!\u201dGu Shishi shouted out loudly and immediately covered up her own mouth as she looked at the man sleeping next to her carefully.The boss was still sound asleep; he merely frowned slightly but did not wake up. It looked like he was having a nice dream as his brows slowly relaxed.Whew\u2026 lucky she didn\u2019t wake him up.Gu Shishi patted herself on her chest, feeling lucky.Quickly, she started drooling over the interface.She had, indeed, noticed the wording \u201cbeginner\u2019s level\u201d before. If the \u201cbeginner\u2019s level\u201d could already make someone felt like they were in the painting in person, then she couldn\u2019t even begin to fathom what mid-level could do!Plus, she thought as evil as the system was, she wouldn\u2019t be seeing mid-level for a while.She would never imagine that just using the beginner\u2019s level for 100 times would open up mid-level skill.Hmm, 100 times\u2026.At the rate of one a day, that would only take 3 months\u2019 time.She gritted her teeth; or she could do 2-3 a day.Oh!It was so close she could almost feel it!Gu Shishi was pleasantly surprised when she realized she could click open and read the details of the mid-level skills.[As Though Assisted By God (Mid-Level): Infused with the artist\u2019s concentration. If focused enough, the art piece would come from the heart. The artist\u2019s concentration that was absorbed into the painting would affect the emotions of the viewers.]\u201cHuh?\u201dThe emotions?That includes: happiness, anger, worry, contemplation, sadness, fear, and surprise; as well as sensations such as visual, auditory, olfactory, taste, touch, and conception.The beginner\u2019s level allowed the viewers to feel like they were at the scene in person; and the mid-level would be able to affect their emotions?That\u2019s amazing!Gu Shishi couldn\u2019t help but ball her fists in excitement.She must try out this ability!Her master was right, an art piece that only allowed the viewers to look at them for entertainment was but a low-end production.Especially when it came to Chinese ink painting. The soul of a painting is the emotions that the artists infused into their work.Gu Shishi couldn\u2019t help but wish she could try out this mid-level ability right away.However, she has not yet unlocked this new ability; she could only drool over it.Some things could not be rushed.What she really should do was to practice the beginner\u2019s level 100 times and work on mastering the ability to the point that she would no longer need to rely on the system\u2019s cheat.As she was thinking about it, Gu Shishi set her goal.\u201c100 times\u2026 that means 200 hours\u2026 that\u2019s 10 days\u2019 worth of life!!\u201dGu Shishi did some calculations with her fingers, then again looked at her three-days\u2019 worth of life since her illness and just wanted to cry.[Doting of the Male Lead: LV2. 30% to LV3.][Acknowledgement of Others: LV1. 70% to LV2.]\u201cEh?

Our men are all professionals.\u201d Nodded Butler Lin.\u201cOkay~ Thank you, Butler Lin!\u201d Gu Shishi let out a sigh of relief.If she had to look for delivering service herself, packaging would be a big issue.Rolled-up paintings in a tube wouldn\u2019t be bad, but a framed one could be very fragile.Shipping was definitely a headache.Now that that was taken care of, and there was still a whole hour before she had to leave for work, Gu Shishi happily returned to her room and turned on her streaming.She changed her channel name to \u201cI Paint So Well I Can Walk On Clouds\u201d, a much more appealing name.She could be as artsy as she wanted before, but now that she intended to sell her work, she needed to attract more traffic.At the same time, she added another line.\u201cMy work today will be given as a gift to one of my viewers.\u201d\u201cStarting today, my work will be for sale. Look for \u2018The Nerdy Painter\u201d on Taobao.\u201dShe had registered for a store on Taobao during breakfast, which was coming in handy now.After propping up her cellphone, she started stretching out her xuan painting paper and preparing her paint brushes.\u201cI will be doing a gongbi style painting today.She finally has up to 5 fans after two streaming sessions.But, she was so early today that most people were still asleep.Gu Shishi thought about it for a bit and decided against switching to a different time. She exchanged the beginner\u2019s skill and closed her eyes to get a feel of her concepts\u2026All she had done was free form style work in the past.Free form style stressed the feel and the artistic conception instead of realistic details.The system skill that allowed viewers to feel that they were in the painting apparently worked very well with free form style creations.But gongbi, as opposed to free form, stressed on precision and meticulousness. Its goal was realism.She wondered how well the system\u2019s cheat would work with gongbi style and whether it would still allow the viewers to experience the painting in person.That\u2019s what Gu Shishi wanted to find out today.Quickly, she closed her eyes. Her brow furrowed.Her body was absorbed into a whole different dimension.When she opened her eyes again, only a few seconds had passed, but it had already experienced an hour\u2019s time.She picked up a pointing paint brush made of weasel bristle and her face had a concentration that had never been seen before. She dipped the brush into the ink and agilely applied her brush on the shuxuan painting paper.A circle in one stroke followed by a dot.The line was smooth, clean, and flowed in one go.She didn\u2019t notice her first audience member in her channel.[MeowMeow: Eh? Are those\u2026 eyes?][MeowMeow: You are giving it away for free? Can I sign up then?]Gu Shishi was just about to switch to a different paint brush and happened to see it.She smiled immediately and said, \u201cMeowMeow? Sure. You can have it for free. The topic was perfect for your nickname. I am painting a cat.\u201d[MeowMeow: Eh? Channel Master is going to draw a cat? Okay, I\u2019ll wait right here!~][MeowMeow sent you 10 omamori.]Each omamori was about $1, and she sent her 10 at once.Gu Shishi smiled.That probably wouldn\u2019t even cover the shipping cost.But that was her very first one, so that was alright.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Channel Master, are you soliciting for face-slapping? I\u2019ll be honest then. Don\u2019t you think your brush is too weak? Shouldn\u2019t you use a different one? My OCD is killing me! And, isn\u2019t your ink a bit light? You sure this is truly ink painting, for real?]* Gou \u2013 has the meaning of \u201cperhaps, sloppy, casual\u201d[Manager Gou: Speaking of. What are you drawing? A broom?!]It was a troll.Gu Shishi didn\u2019t have the time to look at her cellphone; her paintbrush had never stopped moving.After a while, with a sweep of the flattened tip, a fluffy, pointy cat ear from the light ink almost leapt out of the paper!She didn\u2019t sketch with pencil first but drew directly on the paper.Her lines were smooth and precise. The right ear was even tilted slightly, as though it was listening to some noise. Just a few strokes and fun and liveliness were captured completely.The scrolling questions from Manager Gou stopped all of a suddenThe split tip of the paintbrush had obviously created the fluffiness of a cat\u2019s fur.[MeowMeow: Oh, so cute! Channel Master, you are so awesome!]Gu Shishi smiled. With the next few strokes, she created the kitty\u2019s little nose and little mouth\u2026 as well as the fluffy cat\u2019s body and the soft pads on its paws. The long cat tail waved in midair, and its layers of fluffiness was clearly conveyed with the flattened brush tip.Once the silhouette was completed, the rest was to fill it out and emphases on the shades of brightness, the soft fluff of the fur, and the adjustment of the details.Manager Gou never made another peep.He merely typed a \u201c666\u201d* and sent her two omamori, implying that he was down on his knees.* Due to the pronunciation of the number \u201c6\u201d, \u201c666\u201d was used as Chinese internet slang to say someone was very expert in somethingAlong with Gu Shishi\u2019s smooth actions, a chubby, orange tabby rolling on the ground and playing with a butterfly with its paws had formed slowly on the painting paper\u2026Emphasis on the chubby part.In order to convey the chubbiness of the cat, Gu Shishi purposefully added three layers of rolls on its tummy. With its waving paw, it almost looked like its fatty tummy was jiggling with its actions.It\u2019s body full of orange hair was light and fluffy. It was so realistic that it made one want to look at it more carefully and even reach out to pat it.Even a complete novice could tell Gu Shishi\u2019s expertise from the elegant effect of the painting.The channel became progressively quieter.Even the chatty MeowMeow dared not type anything else as though she worried that any noise now would distract Gu Shishi\u2019s paintbrush and ruined the lively orange cat.Right when MeowMeow and Manager Gou were watching her intensely, a string of dialog flashed passed the screen.[King of the Hill: Channel Master, you are streaming again? Did you get my message? Why didn\u2019t you contact me?!][King of the Hill: This cat is alright. I guess is sort of cute. Name your price! I\u2019ll buy it!]Gu Shishi simply ignored him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

One stroke after another, each of them straight, strong, and powerful, giving each of them natural stiffness and also the way they naturally droop at the tips!She was focused, and there was effort behind every stroke.Ink painting was different from oil painting, which could be covered up or picked off with room for mistakes.With ink painting, as soon as the paintbrush hit the paper, it\u2019s done.There were no room for errors!King of the Hill kept on talking nonstop.The other two couldn\u2019t remain silent in the channel anymore.[MeowMeow: Channel Master already promised it to me.

She already promised it to me!][Manager Gou: Know it or not, I can still watch. That\u2019s none of your business!]King of the Hill was livid and quickly sent 10 skyscrapers!He was just about to send more when Gu Shishi just happened to finish up the brightness in the cat\u2019s eyes with the titanium white.Finally, after 45 minutes, a very vivid gongbi painting of an orange tabby playing with a butterfly was completed!Gu Shishi finally has the chance to look at her channel and noticed the tiff from earlier.\u201cI have already promised this painting to MeowMeow. You need to try again next time, King of the Hill!\u201dAs she was talking, she saw the flood of skyscrapers that had come in.Each one of them was $450.Even after the platform taking away 50% of that, she\u2019d still get a little over 200 each. The 11 skyscrapers that she had received in the last 45 minutes came out to be $2,000 plus, almost half a month\u2019s salary at the art studio.Gu Shishi suddenly felt a little bad.She promised to give it away for free. Were these tips for watching her paint?Should she had painted for longer then?\u201cHmm, there\u2019s still some free space on the left side. I will add a little more as a thank you for the tips.\u201d As she was talking, she quickly added some green grass and some small wild flowers.There were butterflies by the flowers, and grass by the flowers.Orange tabby was lying on his side; his fur flowing in the wind.The entire gongbi painting\u2019s set up and artistic conception were now complete, and the painting has gone up to a whole new level!That, again, made King of the Hill wanted to puke blood.All the tips that he threw at her and she added more drawing on someone else\u2019s painting?Why did he feel like an idiot?\u201cAlright!\u201dGu Shishi put down her paintbrush.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She thought about it for a second. As she had a second chance of life, she should have a new alias as well.Using cinnabar, she painted a \u201cInk Painting Guru\u201d stamp. It looked as realistic as if it was from a real stamp.[MeowMeow: OMG\u2026 Channel Master, I am bowing down to you!][Manager Gou: Amazing! The cat already looked like it was a print from a picture!

Sh*t!]The screen had already turned dark before he finished asking his question.\u2026\u2026Gu Shishi rushed to log off because she really wanted to appreciate her Orange Tabby.She believed she had accomplished Living The Painting.She looked at her completed drawing and couldn\u2019t help but want to reach out her hand and stroke the cat.The orange tabby under her hand seemed to have mewed at her in a milky voice obediently and rolled into a ball of fur under her hand. Its chubby body jiggling in an irresistibly cute way.Oh, she could die right now!From cuteness overload!\u201cI suddenly want to have a fluffy pet myself!\u201dGu Shishi stared at Orange Tabby. And, the more she stared at it, the more she wanted to rub some fluffy animals.Aye, she suddenly has the urge to go into the backyard to find a kitty to pet!Unfortunately\u2026 this mansion is too cold. There was nothing soft and fuzzy here.Gu Shishi sighed and took a picture of her painting, uploaded it to Taobao, and made it a price that nobody would pay.It wasn\u2019t long before someone sent her a private message.[MeowMeow: I\u2019m MeowMeow.

Otherwise there would be beginners\u2019 work and master\u2019s level work in the same account. That would be too confusing.[MeowMeow: Oh, okay.]Their little exchange and confirming her address took about 10 minutes.That wasn\u2019t even counting the time spent sending the item out. There were a lot of odds and ends involved.\u201cLuckily, I will be selling at most one or two a day, otherwise this is not going to be sustainable\u2026\u201d said Gu Shishi to herself.She thought about it for a second and fumbled out her feeding chicken painting.She took a picture of it and placed it on Taobao.Price: $30,000.This was a pretty high price considering the size of the piece and that the more playful conception.Normally, a somewhat well-known artist would be able to fetch up to $20,000 for a piece like this.However, all those aside, this piece was infused with Living the Painting cheat.Having that in mind, Gu Shishi decided to set it as a slightly higher starting price. After all, she planned on selling more in the future. It\u2019d be a hassle if she doesn\u2019t start out higher.In the future when she created large size landscape artistic conception work with Living the Painting, she was thinking she should at least ask for $1 million up.\u201cOkay! All set! Time to go to work!\u201dAfter she has set the price, there was now 1 inventory in her Taobao shop.She ended up naming that piece \u201cDidn\u2019t Get Red Packet. Not Happy!\u201d Pleased with herself, she packed up and headed to the art studio.Before she took off, Butler Lin, for the first time, approached her and said the chauffeur could drop her off.Gu Shishi was very surprised, but she declined the offer.\u201cIt\u2019ll double as exercising. Otherwise all I\u2019d be doing is eat and sleep and sleep and eat. And I am mostly sitting down at work as well.\u201dBeing a painter was physical work.Without the physical fitness to back it up, it\u2019d be hard to last even two hours.When one\u2019s hand was stable, the paint brush would be sturdy, and the lines would not be crooked. All these called for good physical fitness.The ultra large size landscape painting could take over 8 hours a day for three weeks to over a month sometimes.\u201cBut if I can trouble the chauffeur to pick me up at night, that\u2019d be great.\u201dShe\u2019s afraid of the darkness. She didn\u2019t want to walk in the dark.\u201cNo problem, Miss Gu.\u201dButler Lin made a note immediately.***After Gu Shishi arrived at the art studio in pouring sweat, she realized it was very calm and peaceful today.Neither one of the two trouble-making men were there. She almost felt a bit odd.After an entire day of class, she stopped Zhao Xian before she left work.\u201cDo you have the contact information of Luo Zheng?\u201dZhao Xian looked alarmed, \u201cWhy? What do you want it for?\u201dDid she want to seduce her boyfriend?Did Gu Shishi regret after she went home last night?Luo Zheng might have a quick temper and looked down on women, but he was generous. When he was in a good mood normally, he would also mutter sweet words and was very gentlemanly in the way that he acted.\u201cOh, nothing much.

She didn\u2019t even have the chance to add detailed description of the merchandise or add a short clip of the panning from close up to afar of the painting.And it was sold already?Just from a picture taken with a cellphone camera?Wealthy people!Nouveau riches were everywhere!In her past life, her master banned her from selling any of her work before she was 20. Instead, he always pressured her to practice her foundation until it was perfect. What he said to her was that she would have plenty of time to make money in the future and that there was no rush for that.Finally, she gained her master\u2019s acknowledgement to sell her work.But, by then, her master was already very sick. She spent most of her time in and out of the hospital taking care of him and never paid attention to whether her work was sold.Then, she had that car accident shortly after her master had passed away.Come to think about it, she was just a noob in selling paintings; she had only seen her master doing it before.But today\u2026 she finally understood what her master meant.Everything that he said was true.\u201cIf you don\u2019t perfect your skills, you can sell 100 pieces of work, but they won\u2019t be worth as much combined as just one piece of work after you mastered the techniques.\u201dThat\u2019s what they meant by \u201c[A business] that was not opened for business for three years, once opened, immediately made enough for the three upcoming years.\u201dShe had just made $30,000 in the blink of an eye!It was too bad that she couldn\u2019t convert these to life or use them to convert to cheats in the system.*But, she immediately recalled how she could feel like she was inside her painting with the cheat of the system and that made her feel better.She was happy for a while but she did not forget what she needed to get done. She checked quickly the address of the nouveau rich before she rushed back into her room, rolled up the painting into a mailing tube, slung her backpack back on and went to look for Butler Lin to take another trip.She hadn\u2019t frame the free Orange Tabby painting earlier.But if she mailed this Little Chickens painting that cost $30,000 just in a mailing tube, that seemed to be a bit sloppy. She didn\u2019t want to give the feeling that the quality was poor.She had found a framing shop a while back. Luckily, they were still open after she rushed over there.She paid the down payment, picked out a frame, and confirmed the time it would be done before she headed back to the mansion.\u2014Translator\u2019s rambling: \u201cIt was too bad that she couldn\u2019t convert these to life or use them to convert to cheats in the system.\u201dBut she can send them as red pocket to ML so he\u2019ll send her back the same amount.

She then sent her new WeChat information to MeowMeow.She had promised her she\u2019d do that today.After she had everything taken care of, she went back to the mansion and rushed into the dining room like a Tasmanian devil and started enjoying her late dinner.This was the second day that she could stomach rich food again.Uncle Chef seemed to particularly have her in mind when he cooked and prepared her favorite dish from a while back \u2013 bacon and spaghetti with white sauce accompanied with baked lamb chop.The sizzling fat drizzling from the golden brown and crispy lamb chop and the spice on top of it that was dancing around visibly to the naked eyes\u2026.She rolled a fork-full of spaghetti that was covered in white sauce and radiating the most delectable aroma that could make one drool.SLOOO~~With a roll of the fork, Gu Shishi started to feast on her dinner.She had been having nothing but porridge for the last 2-3 days from her stomach issue. Now her taste buds that had been hibernating had finally been awakened.Every mouthful was delicious. And every mouth full brought about the melodious sound of life being added.Eating was indeed the number one happiest event in life!\u201cOoooh, so happy~~\u201dShe swallowed a mouthful of food and started taking pictures of the food in front of her.As she was happily snapping away, she saw Siyi walking past her.\u201cGood evening, Siyi,\u201d Gu Shishi greeted happily.Yet Siyi merely nodded at her stiffly.Gu Shishi blinked and noticed a corner of a dark brown shirt outside of the dining room.The boss?Yikes\u2026.She stood up immediately and peeked.Sure enough!Huo Sishen was standing outside the dining room with his hands behind him, expressionlessly.He was tall and well built. His presence was undeniable even when he was just standing there.Gu Shishi thought about it for a second and immediately walked over with her fork in an attempt to brown nose him.She had just received an amazing gift from the boss yesterday.She must show her appreciation properly!\u201cMr. Huo, have you had dinner yet? Would you like to join\u2026.\u201dShe was halfway through before Huo Sishen frowned at her.\u201cNo need. I don\u2019t dine at the same table as others.\u201dIn fact, as she was approaching him, the icy cold don\u2019t-get-close-to-me aura was already radiating from him.\u201cAlright.\u201d Gu Shishi did not push the issue.She did, however, smiled at him before she turned back.\u201cI really like the giant teddy bear. I felt so complete with it. I even feel luckier! I sold my painting today in no time flat and fetched a good price at that.\u201dShe was genuinely happy when she said that.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She felt that she was every bit as skillful as someone in their fifties or sixties.As she was thinking that, she stood up straighter with pride.\u201cThe customer didn\u2019t even ask any questions nor did he barter about the price. He just bought it straight up!\u201cHe\u2019s so decisive, enterprising, and has taste!\u201d[Huo Sishen\u2019s fondness increased!]Eh?!Gu Shishi was a little stunned.Why did it go up all of a sudden?Was it because she was sharing her good news with him and treating him like a friend?She paused for a second before she carried on.\u201cThat customer has such good eye. It was only a painting of some chickens, but presumably he saw the beauty in my strokes. Quite frankly, I have not met very many connoisseurs like him, ever\u2026\u201d[Huo Sishen\u2019s fondness increased!]Wha? Wha? Wha?Again?She sneaked a peek at the boss in front of her.She noticed that he had lifted his brows and made no comment, almost an indifferent look on him.But, his thin lips seemed to be curving upward\u2026Aye\u2026 was the boss in a very good mood today?Her conclusion made her happy.She started sharing more of her personal thoughts.\u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of people who appreciate Chinese ink painting and are willing to buy those from some unknown artist anymore.\u201cI feel this 111 might turn into a regular customer of mine. I wonder what he likes? Figures, flowers, and birds are my strength, and my landscape painting had gone up a level as well.\u201cMaybe I will ask him over WeChat when I have a chance.\u201dSuddenly, Huo Sishen frowned.His lips opened slightly, and his voice a little coarse.\u201cWeChat?\u201d\u201cOh, yes. I opened up a new account, and I have already sent my information to this tasteful brother\u2026\u201dGu Shishi continued yakking on.Huo Sishen immediately looked dubiously as Siyi, who was standing nearby.Siyi shuddered immediately.Huo Sishen casually mumbled an acknowledgement and finally, when Gu Shishi was talking so much she was almost out of breath, he reached out a slender finger and pointed at her dinner from afar.\u201cGetting cold.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dGu Shishi subconsciously looked at his finger.Oh, mi! His index finger was long, slender, with prominent knuckles. The muscles were distributed evenly and the lines pretty\u2026 she looked up from there. His wrist joint was perfect. His wheat colored lower arm and the black rolled-up sleeve of his shirt was\u2026. Colorful, subtle, and secretly explosive. So attractive!The boss\u2019s hand was good enough for him to become a hand model!How come she had never noticed that before?Huo Sishen didn\u2019t get a response so he looked down.And he saw the girl staring at his hand, drooling. She might even have gulped\u2026.He frowned and quietly took his hand back.The pretty scene disappeared suddenly in front of Gu Shishi.She looked away in disappointment.But quickly, she cocked her head and recalled the takeaway.What did the boss say was getting cold?\u201cOMG! My lamb chop that was drizzling grease!\u201dIt\u2019d be too gamey once it got cold!Huo Sishen pursed his lips and finally lifted his feet and walked out of the dining room.He turned and headed up the stairs as he fished out his cellphone.He handed it over to Siyi.\u201cAdd it.\u201dHis intention was clear.Add her second WeChat account.Siyi acknowledged immediately.Of course, he wasn\u2019t stupid enough to ask a dumb question like whether Miss Gu would notice that.The boss had a dual card cellphone.He has always had two different numbers, one for work and one personal.\u201cIt\u2019s done, boss.\u201dHuo Sishen took his phone back and took a look.He nodded.As he stepped onto the second step, he finished scrolling through her friend\u2019s circle.He pointed at the third cat painting and asked coldly, \u201cWhen was this?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

More like a raffle. She raffled it off while she was streaming.\u201dHuo Sishen lifted his brows again.\u201cUgh. I was just about to report that to you. This was when she started her Taobao store and she told me about her streaming channel and that there was raffle and told me that I should visit it often.\u201dHuo Sishen\u2019s look was still stiff.Siyi felt goosebumps forming on his body.

As she was debating about whether she should reheat it, she received a few new messages.[MeowMeow has sent you a friend\u2019s request.]MeowMeow was so impatient that she had sent that multiple times.Gu Shishi accepted it immediately.[MeowMeow transferred you $10,000.]Gu Shishi was a little stunned.[MeowMeow: I really like kitties. I had a little orange tabby when I was a child but my mom gave it away\u2026 your painting was so good that it reminded me of him~]Gu Shishi hadn\u2019t expected the coincidence, nor did she expect that MeowMeow was so\u2026 not strapped for money.Spending $10,000 just like that. Were all kids that wealthy nowadays?MeowMeow\u2019s profit picture was a girl with wavy hair down to her shoulders, probably in her twenties.Her curiosity got the better part of her, and she clicked into MeowMeow\u2019s friend\u2019s circle.One look and she was enveloped in wealthy aura.Horseback riding, golfing, skiing, parasailing\u2026 all expensive activities.Never mind the regular posts of a new purse or a new pair of shoes.She was, indeed, from money\u2026How come she kept running into all these nouveau riches lately? Was that a side effect from the transmigration?Even Gu Shishi started to question how unscientific that was.Quickly, MeowMeow sent her another message.[Guru, I have another favor to ask. This upcoming Saturday is my grandma\u2019s birthday. Can I ask you to paint me a mythical peach painting as her birthday gift? I am open for discussion on the cost.]Gu Shishi didn\u2019t expect her next transaction to come so quickly.Using mythical peaches for birthday wish was, indeed, a hot topic in Chinese ink painting.As the myth went, \u201cthose who had consumed the mystical jade peach would gain eternal life\u201d. Which was why paintings of mythical peaches were the best to use as a gift to an elderly person and also a popular theme among collectors. After all, its meaning was positive and also very traditional.Gu Shishi thought about it for a second before she responded.[I can give that a try. Do you have any specific ask? Anything that your grandma likes in particular?]MeowMeow\u2019s respond came a little slower this time.[Just something jubilant that can appease the elderly, no special ask.][Oh, I am going to go shopping now. Let\u2019s chat later! Oh, yeah, Guru.

You can decide then if you want it.]After she sent that message, she closed the chat window.As she was brainstorming for the painting, she mindlessly scrolled through MeowMeow\u2019s next two pages of friend\u2019s circle and unexpectedly came across a picture that MeowMeow had just posted with one of her girlfriends.In the picture, she had her arms around two other girls and they were eating ice cream cones.One of the girls was slim and fragile and looked very familiar. She was Gu Wushuang, whom she hadn\u2019t seen in a while.What a small world.Gu Shishi squinted.Her cellphone rang the very next minute.Speaking of the devil!It was a call from Gu Wushuang!She smiled and picked it up. In came the milky voice of Gu Wushuang.\u201cShishi, elder Mrs. Chen is having her birthday banquet this Saturday and Miss Chen asked me to invite you as well. The Chen\u2019s is a prominent family in the city, and Miss Chen is a very nice person as well. Your engagement party was a bit rushed so neither mommy nor I had the opportunity to introduce you to everyone.\u201cSo we think this will be a good opportunity for you to come and make some friends. Shishi, come hang out with us, what do you say? I will have the chauffeur come and pick you up at 11 AM, how does that sound?\u201dGu Wushuang\u2019s voice naturally sounded like it was coated with honey.So sweet that it made one felt sick.But her tone\u2026 the forcefulness was hidden in her soft tone, making it difficult for others to turn down.She kept on asking \u201cwhat do you say?\u201d and \u201chow does that sound\u201d\u2026. As though she really valued your opinion, yet step by step, she pushed her into a corner.Gu Shishi took a bite of her lamb chop, wiped away the grease around her mouth, and smiled sarcastically.She was just thinking how the fake daughter was behaving lately, and things had been so peaceful before this call too.So that was the trap she was setting up for her.In the book, it was described that every single SGR was on Gu Wushuang\u2019s side.They received the same education since they were children. The way they look at the world, the way they think, and their interests were all very similar.One look at Gu Shishi, and she was like oil trying to blend with water. No matter how hard she tried, she\u2019d always be the odd one out that was ostracized.All the SGR had always looked down on her, not to mention her engagement with the infamous Huo Sishen, who didn\u2019t even show up to his own engagement banquet, showing absolutely no respect for her.Gu Shishi didn\u2019t even need to think to know what the outcome would be if she attended the banquet.She\u2019d be isolated, mocked, looked down upon!During the banquet, the real daughter would be the vulgar one to make the fake daughter seem more pitiful and noble.That was on great plan that Gu Wushuang had in mind.Except that this Gu Shishi grew up reading Emperor\u2019s Policies and Comprehensive Mirror in Aid of Governance. She could so see through all her little tricks!She looked at the invite that she sent via her text.Then, she looked at her money transfer and chat history with MeowMeow on her little Mickey Mouse cellphone and couldn\u2019t help but smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The ultimate purpose must be for her to bend into the wives\u2019 and missus\u2019 circles of the prominent families.She would need to obtain enough social status and gain the respect of these so-called prominent individuals.Gu Wushuang was right about one thing. Attending banquet would be the easiest way for her to achieve that.Her \u201cAcknowledge From Others\u201d bar had been growing very slowly lately.She must go so she could live on!And not just to attend, but to gain a lot of fondness while she was there.As Gu Shishi was thinking over that, she finished her last bite of spaghetti with white sauce.\u201cOkay, sister Wushuang, I am hanging up now.\u201dShe chuckled.A couple of days later, when it was time to pick up her drawing, Gu Shishi took half a day off and went to the framing shop in person to pick up the painting.She picked the frame out personally; it was a wood pattern in dark color. The very village style frame complimented the Little Chickens painting very well.Gu Shishi let out a sigh of relief.She paid the store owner $100 and brought the painting back to the mansion.She wrote the address down on a piece of paper and had Butler Lin ship it out.It was a little bit awkward to address the item to 111\u2026.But, Butler Lin merely took a look at it and didn\u2019t comment on that. He merely said, \u201cOkay. It will get there today.\u201dGu Shishi nodded and thanked him.After she was done talking with Butler Lin, she messaged 111 that she had already shipped the item and it would get there today and that it\u2019s best for him to wait at home.She plopped down on the couch and let out a big sigh after everything was all done.Every single cell inside her body were dancing excitedly. They were thrilled, energized, and each and every single one of them wanted to jump up and scream!She sold her first painting!For $30,000!Her very first in this lifetime and also her very first in her past lifetime!Master, did you see it?Your precious disciple had finally made it! She sold her very first painting and made money from it! There was someone out there who appreciated her painting!Gu Shishi covered her own mouth, whimpered through it as she rolled three times on the couch.She was so happy and this called for some celebration!She jumped up, and seeing that she still has some time left before noon time, she went downstairs to look for Butler Lin.After Butler Lin heard her question, he was a little stunned, \u201cA foot spa?\u201d\u201cUh huh, I like to soak my feet when I draw. Oh, it\u2019s okay if there isn\u2019t one. I can get myself one from Taobao.Gu Shishi felt a bit awkward as she was talking.She just assumed that a mansion this size naturally would have everything.\u201cGive me a minute.\u201dButler Lin was only stunned for a little while.\u201cOkay, then I am going to go back to my room first.\u201dHalf an hour later, someone knocked on her room door.Along with the knocking, there was the announcement from the system.[Received solid wood soaking tub with massaging function x 1 from your husband.

It was comfortable.Gu Shishi made herself comfortable sitting down next to her desk and picked up her paintbrush.Not only had she mimicked countless mythical peach paintings, she had also created dozens of original ones herself.So she planned to up the challenge level today.She wanted to paint a Children Offering Up Mythical Peaches painting.All elderlies, especially the wealthy ones, always wanted to have lots of children. They believed that the more children you have, the luckier you were.She has decided on a painting with 4-5 children, all offering up the mythical peaches.Combining figures, birds and flowers all into one.That way, the painting would look rich and not monotonous, lively and festive.She first formulated the picture in her head before she put it on paper.After it was done, she looked at it left and right and felt that there weren\u2019t a lot of errors on it and was a decent work.\u201cThe artistic conception though\u2026. it\u2019s a little lacking.\u201dGu Shishi sighed.Was it really not possible to make other live the painting without the system\u2019s cheat?How far away was her from the system\u2019s beginner\u2019s level?She gritted her teeth, took a look at her full five days\u2019 worth of life bar, and converted three hours of the skill.That was painful.The composition of the painting did not change. It was still the same children and peaches.But when she closed her eyes, she could almost hear the giggling sound from the young children and the nonstop, boisterous \u201cGrandma!\u201d and \u201cHave a peach!\u201d filled her ears.Gu Shishi closed her eyes and her body shuddered.Souls.She had spent a lot of time perfecting her figure skill. As her style has the natural exquisiteness that of a female, her master had she focused solely on figures at the beginning. He said that was a good path for her.As much as she had perfected the expressions, actions, as well as the patterns and materials of their outfits, did her figures lack souls?A figure without its spirit, no matter how detailed it was, would still be too overly superficial and not enough to touch the viewers.Gu Shishi felt that she was slowly figuring out the entrance to her next path.Right now, when she reached her hand out, she felt a fuzzy peach that was so huge in size that she couldn\u2019t even hold it in one hand. And she could even smell its sweet aroma in her nose.At that very moment, she seemed to have turned into one of the children in the painting, who just found out what a mythical peach looked like.Gu Shishi had her eyes closed and couldn\u2019t tell the passing of time\u2026***On the other hand, Chen Kexin, also known as MeowMeow, goofed around for two whole days and finally remembered the mailing tube that the maid had placed in her room.She has yet to open it.As she had seen the picture of it already, she wasn\u2019t eager to open it up and look at the real thing.\u201cI wonder if she\u2019s done with the congratulatory painting for grandma\u2019s birthday yet?\u201dChen Kexin thought about the time in her mind before she opened up the mailing tube.Right when she was thinking to herself that she\u2019d text her and find out where she was with the painting, her eyes were dazzled by the drawing paper that she had just pulled out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It\u2019s fuzzy stomach with the hidden rolls were exposed and it\u2019s long and fuzzy tail sticking way up\u2026.It\u2019s soft and cute right paw reaching out to the butterfly in the air, and it\u2019s left paw hovering in front of its chest.

If you\u2019re reading this elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.She already felt that the painting was realistic when she saw it in the channel.But she just assumed it was under the effect of several filters through the cellphone which had beautified it. But now that she was looking at the actual painting, this gongbi painting cat in front of her eyes look looked like it could leap out of the paper at any moment.It wasn\u2019t just the look of the cat, even the movement of its body reminded her of the little orange tabby that she once had in the past.The fur on its tummy was natural, soft, fluffy, and shiny.And the fur that was under it stretched outward from under its weight.Its slightly opened kitty mouth and its sparkly limpid eyes, all showcased how relaxed and free-willed Orange Tabby was.\u201cJuju\u2026.\u201dChen Kexin couldn\u2019t help but call its name, her eyes focused somewhere far.She picked up the painting and hugged it with her arms, yet sensing the thinness of the paper, her face was filled with regret and disappointment.It was just an illusion.This was a painting, not her Juju.Chen Kexin gritted her teeth and put the painting down.But she couldn\u2019t help but pick it back up in the next second.It almost looked like the orange tabby in the painting had gotten hold of the butterfly and showing it off to her. It opened its mouth goofily and gave her the most milky meow that melted her heart.This gongbi painting was incredible beyond any words!The more she looked at it, the more real it looked.The more she looked at it, the move lively it seemed.And not just the orange tabby, even the butterfly that it was playing with looked like its wings were fluttering in the air.\u201cCould this channel master\u2026. Be some alias of some master-level painter?\u201dChen Kexin was stunned.She immediately opened up Nerdy Painter\u2019s Taobao store and saw that the Little Chickens painting had already been sold.Asking price: $30,000.\u201cWas it sold for real?\u201dThat was just her allowance for a month. It meant nothing to her.Due to her normal social circle, she was somewhat familiar with oil painting and Chinese ink painting.$30,000, that was definitely an asking price of a well known artist.Otherwise, it would be difficult for an unknown painter to fetch a five-digit amount on a village style fun painting no matter how good her skill was.She had originally thought that was just some marketing technique from the channel master in order to create a high-end foundation of her products by faking a sale utilizing the hunger marketing technique.But\u2026 now that she has seen the painting of the orange tabby in person, she wasn\u2019t so sure any more.\u201cNo wonder she wouldn\u2019t let me pay her. Probably because she knew this painting was worth way more than $10,000. She didn\u2019t really care about $10,000, so she just gave it to me for free?\u201dThe more she thought about it, the more she thought that this \u201cOil Painting Guru\u201d was no ordinary artist.Perhaps Guru, wasn\u2019t just self-inflation, but a true master in the art form!But was it possible to have a master so young?\u201cOr is she really good at taking care of herself?\u201dThe hand that she had seen holding the paintbrush in the channel looked young, tender, and a pale pinkish color; it looked like one that belonged to a young woman.Her voice was milky and sweet as well so she couldn\u2019t be that old.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In order to prepare a delicate gift for her grandmother, Chen Kexin had started her search since a month ago.She worried that her being no expert in antiques or painting, she would accidentally end up with knockoffs. Not only would they be of low quality, but it would also be humiliating.Which was why starting last month, she had asked around for a few somewhat well-known artists in the Chinese ink painting artists and calligraphy artists to have them collaborate on a painting with calligraphy for her grandmother.Some of the masters were quirky and would not accept the request.Some others\u2019 work was so expensive that she couldn\u2019t afford them with her allowance.So she had another idea. She\u2019d forego well-known artists and look for the ones that were not yet well known and give her grandmother 10 paintings with inscription from 10 different individuals. As the number 10 would suggest perfection.She thought that was a great idea before, but now, not so much.She emptied out her boxes, dug out all the paintings that she had already collected, and spread them out next to Orange Tabby and Butterfly.\u201cUgh\u2026 this disparity\u2026\u201dWhen they were placed next to each other, the disparity between them was only too obvious.Let it be the lines, the form, the soft naturalness of the strokes, or the painted objects\u2019 charm or aura were all of an entirely different level.The Orange Tabby instakilled all the other paintings.\u201cAll these look like they are missing something\u2026 like they have no souls\u2026\u201dChen Kexin looked at them over and over again.Discouraged, she picked up the phone once again.[Master, how big of a painting do you have in mind? Maybe we should go with something smaller? Can you give me an idea of how much it\u2019d cost?]Chen Kexin wanted to cry.She had underestimated the channel master previously. She worried now that she wouldn\u2019t be able to afford the painting when she heard the price!The bigger the size of painting of any well-known artists, the higher the cost.Chen Kexin, having been purchasing a lot of congratulatory paintings and loved to shop on a regular basis, didn\u2019t have a lot of her allowance left.But she did not want to give up now!After this comparison, she\u2019d be embarrassed to follow through with her original plan of giving her grandmother 10 different paintings.With her cellphone in hand, she waited anxiously for a response.***On the other side, Gu Shishi finished her Four Sons Offering Up Mythical Peaches painting in pouring sweat.All the fine sweat on her face was from heat.She didn\u2019t realize she had soaked her feet for 1.5 hours!It was surprising that she didn\u2019t pass out\u2026.But earlier, when she was focused entirely on the paintbrush in her hand, she was one with the paintbrush and couldn\u2019t feel time passing at all.She only noticed that she was about to break down from heat after her cellphone had vibrated.[I am done with it already. Let me send you a picture of it.]Gu Shishi relaxed her shoulder and turned off her foot spa before taking a picture and sending it over to MeowMeow.As for the price\u2026.[Just pay me however much you see fit.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You sure I can name my own price? I don\u2019t have a lot lately. If I ask around, I think I will be able to scrounge up maybe\u2026. $30,000 (said in a very low voice)\u2026..]Gu Shishi chuckled when she saw that.[Okay, $30,000 it is then.][Would you like me to frame it too?]{MeowMeow: Oh, no, no, no! Master. Just give me an address and I will come pick it up in person! I will take it to a framing shop myself!}Gu Shishi was a little surprised by that; guess they would have to meet around the art studio then.She didn\u2019t think the boss would appreciate visitors.[Sure. How about 1 PM in the afternoon?][MeowMeow: Yes, yes, yes!]She even followed up with a very respectful emoji.A few minutes later, Gu Shishi heard the system\u2019s voice.[Received fondness from Chen Kexin.][Acknowledge From Others: LV2 reached!]Gu Shishi paused a little in surprise before she was ecstatic!It was exactly what she had expected!The level of difficulty in gaining others\u2019 fondness varied! In addition, how their amount contributed also varied!From her observation, between LV1 to LV2, every time she gained someone\u2019s fondness, the average contribution was 10% of the progress.Yet, she tested that out a couple of days ago.Using Ling Xiaomei as an example, ever since the first time the fondness gone up, whether it was giving her rides home, taking her out to lunch, or giving her drawing lessons, the fondness level had never gone up again.On the other hand, Zhao Xian, who were always picking on her, increased her progress twice.Or those she had met through her streaming channel such as MeowMeow or King of the Hill, they showed no contribution to her progress at all.Until today\u2026 when Chen Kexin, MeowMeow, received her second painting, was the first time her progress had gone up.And the fondness from her alone was 20% of the progress, much higher than all the others!\u201cWas it because she was from a prominent family?\u201d speculated Gu Shishi.As the system was termed \u201cWealthy Housewife System\u201d, then there must be special treatment toward those from prominent families and upper class social circles.Very likely, they\u2019d receive a bonus amount in the \u201cAcknowledge From Others\u201d category!Chen Kexin was a SGR and Zhao Xian was the girlfriend of a SGR.Relatively speaking, all others, such as Ling Xiaomei, who has nothing to do with the prominent family circle, fell under the commoner category?\u201cReceiving fondness from those in the prominent family circle is more difficult, but once succeeded, the experience gained will be twice that of a commoner.\u201dGu Shishi took out her little notebook and recorded her speculation about the system.[Host\u2019s Level: LV2 (The Prominent Family\u2019s Fiancee That Is Slowly Gaining Attention).][Life\u2019s limit raised up to 7 days!][Remaining Life Balance: 4 days 19 hours.]\u201cFinally, I will be able to live up to a week\u2026\u201dGu Shishi sluggishly plopped onto the couch after she had finished appreciating the outcome.But only to bounce back up in the next second.\u201cTime for drawing and recharging!\u201dNow she was someone with $60,000 in her bank account!Quite different from the abjection of someone only having a 3-digit amount in their savings not too long ago!She was able to experience being a nouveau riche for once and generously purchased the highest amount of diamond package in the game \u2014 $648 for 6,480 diamonds, before she started her crazy drawing fiend.\u201cSSR!

Now that he was looking at the actual item, he finally had a good look of this Little Chickens Eating Rice painting. Correction, the title of the painting was \u201cDid Not Receive Red Pocket; Not Happy\u201d. With a closer look, he noticed a clean inscription on the painting.[No? No?][Chicken! Frugal!]The subtext behind the chickens eating rice was that she did not receive any red pockets and calling someone frugal like a chicken?Siyi really wanted to laugh out loud. He felt that his cheeks were getting painful from trying not to laugh.Qin Ruhai had told him about how Miss Gu had sent the boss red packet.Did that mean the boss did not send her any back?Miss Gu was certainly the type who\u2019d hold grudges\u2026 just look at her painting. The few chickens were so mad that their tails were sticking straight up and they were body slamming each other. As cute as the painting was, the cock fighting feel of it was undeniable.\u201cBoss, here\u2019s the painting from Miss GU.\u201dHaving said that, Siyi looked up to check on the reaction from his boss.Sure enough, after Huo Sishen scanned the painting with his black eyes, his tightly shut lips twitched.\u201c\u2026.. profane!\u201d He spat out the word through gritted teeth.\u201cUgh, then boss, should I have the butler store it away?\u201dSiyi stepped forward right away.But Huo Sishen give him a cold stare.\u201cThe painting skill was above average. The chickens\u2019 forms and expressions were all different and sort of interesting. That could barely\u2026 cover up the profane inscription on the painting.\u201d\u201cGo put it in the collection room.\u201dSiyi: \u201c\u2026..\u201dDifferent expressions on the chickens?He gave it another dubious look and still couldn\u2019t tell any difference between them.Weren\u2019t they all fighting chickens who were mad at not being able to get the rice?But Miss Gu drawing was superb indeed. Even a complete layman like him could tell her disgruntledness through the paper.\u201cYes, Sir. I will go hang it up right away.\u201dSiyi dared not comment any further.He turned around and was just about to exit the room when a loud bang came from outside of the room.They could hear Butler Lin\u2019s voice immediately.\u201cMiss Gu, be careful! Are you alright?\u201cDon\u2019t move! I\u2019ll go get the first aid kit!\u201cSomeone come and clean up the glass from the chandelier on the floor!\u201dSiyi\u2019s stopped in mid action.Chandelier? The loud noise was from the chandelier falling down in the hallway?Was Miss Gu hurt?His couldn\u2019t help but turn pale.He had gotten into a car accident once after he started working for his boss in the mansion.Butler Lin slipped and rolled down from the second floor shortly after he had arrived at the mansion.The chef that they hired was burned by hot oil from the pan after cooking one meal\u2026Siyi shuddered and felt a chill on the back of his neck.He looked at his boss sitting behind the desk with a complicated and anxious look \u2013 the man rumored to bring about bad luck to those around him.Sure enough, Huo Sishen\u2019s face could not have darkened more.The relaxed distaste from earlier had all but dissipated; filling its place was the calm before a storm.A stone-cold voice rang inside the room the very next second.\u201cThrow this painting into the storage room.\u201cI won\u2019t be needing it anymore.\u201dEverybody close to him would be met with a terrible fate.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Before she could make out what had happened, the chandelier above her fell right in front of her!That was a close one.She had drawn ten different times and didn\u2019t even get one SSR.She had been so mad that she stopped in her track to stomp her feet. Had she not stopped and walked at her original speed, the chandelier would probably have fallen right on top of her and cracked her head.Even though the chandelier didn\u2019t land on her, she had on a short skirt so the shattered glass still grazed her calves.The saving grace was that none of them hit her on her face.Before Gu Shishi had even recovered from the shock, she heard a warning sound from the system.[The host had an accident and is now bleeding.][Life is decreasing at the rate of 101%.]Gu Shishi, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAs sensitive as the system was, would annual physicals still be necessary?She was going to decline Butler Lin with his first aid kit, but now all she could do was squat down and wait for Butler Lin.While she was waiting, she saw Siyi walking out of the study.Gu Shishi smiled at him dryly.She happened to be sitting right outside the study.\u201cMiss Gu, are you alright?\u201d Siyi nodded at her.\u201cOh, I am fine. The chandelier didn\u2019t hit me, so just minor grazes.\u201dAs she was a painter, Gu Shishi was used to observing people. She could tell immediately that the look on siyi was complicated. There was concern, mixed with a little bit of compassion, and even some fear.As though the timing of it all was very bad.What was the matter?What was he afraid of?She cocked her head and peeked inside the study through the cracked open door.But the only thing she was able to see was the back of a chair facing the door.That and the side profile of a handsome face.Boss Huo\u2026Gu Shishi\u2019s mouth opened a little.She wanted to stay something but quickly kept her mouth shut.The curtains inside the study haven\u2019t been shut all day.The afternoon sun shined directly onto the elm wood floor, making even the glass on the bookshelves seemed as if it was glowing.However, the desk right next to the window was like a lone island.All the light surrounding it seemed to be blocked by the tall branches of the trees on this island, shielding it completely from the man sitting on the chair.He might be sitting in the light, but it looked like he was sitting on a distinctive dark side.\u201cBANG!\u201dSiyi closed the room\u2019s door.And cut off her sight.Gu Shishi recollected herself.All the way until Butler Lin came over with the first aid kit, she was still a little lost at the scene that she just saw.What\u2019s the matter with the boss?He seemed to have been in a better mood the last couple of days.Did he have insomnia again?She didn\u2019t even feel much when Butler Lin was cleaning her wounds for her.The servants of the mansion had already cleaned the floor in a well-trained, orderly fashion.A new lamp had already been put up to replace the old.She did not recollect herself until Butler Lin was about to take off with the first aid kit.\u201cButler Lin, is Mr. Huo in a bad mood again?\u201dGu Shishi slowly climbed up from the floor.Butler Lin was a little bit surprised at her question.He thought about it for a little, then shook his head.\u201cWe never tried to speculate what is on Young Master\u2019s mind. Our job is to carry out all orders coming from him.\u201cIf there\u2019s nothing else, I will take off now, Miss Gu.\u201dGu Shishi rubbed her nose and said, \u201cOh, alright.

Was it because they were all afraid of him?Siyi seemed to always be the go-between on just about everything.Did the boss never talk to anyone else?But they all lived under the same roof, so why was that?Gu Shishi looked in the direction of the study in disbelief.Were they afraid of him, or did he keep his distance with them purposefully?Was it because of the rumor that he\u2019d bring about bad luck to those who were close to him?She was almost hit by the chandelier and the way Siyi was looking at her had changed to an oddly alarmed look.Butler Lin, who had just started smiling at her from time to time, had returned to his official distant look.Was this because they felt that her accident was caused by Huo Sishen\u2019s curse?As she was spacing out while staring at the door, she suddenly noticed that the door had been opened from the inside without her noticing.Huo Sishen leaned against the door frame. His dark eyes were so cold one couldn\u2019t hardly tell he was still alive.At least, she has only seen eyes like that right before her master passed away, a calmness without any vigor or hope.

We will call off the engagement. This money should be enough for you for the rest of your life.\u201dHuo Sishen never walked out. He was still standing inside the study.$20 million, in addition to this mansion that has a market value of $30 million.That was almost a total of $50 million.Gu Shishi\u2019s chest was pounding heavily and even her blood was racing through her veins.However, when she looked down, she saw the whitened knuckles of Huo Sishen as he was holding onto the card.It felt as if thunder had just struck her brain.No, she couldn\u2019t do that.If she left now, the boss would definitely die in 2 years, according to the plotline.And she\u2026 wouldn\u2019t she also die with him.Plus, the boss seemed to be solitary, lonely and cold.Huo Sishen squinted, \u201cNot enough?\u201dGu Shishi bit her lips.She shook her head.Huo Sishen\u2019s face darkened, and his eyes were filled with scorn.\u201cOkay, give me a number. Or any other request.\u201dGu Shishi stared at him blankly. She looked at the face that was so masculine and handsome that she could paint him into one of her paintings\u2026 and shook her head again with great difficulty.The boss wanted to boot her out and she had no grounds to negotiate with him.But she couldn\u2019t do that.Thoughts raced through her brain.What could she do?How could she placate the boss?\u201cYou will agree to\u2026. any of my requests?\u201dGu Shishi\u2019s eyes beamed all of a sudden.Huo Sishen\u2019s face darkened more, and he nodded scornfully.Gu Shishi broke out into a happy smile, \u201cThen I wish that you would pay me the money and the house\u2026. In installment!\u201dHuo Sishen\u2019s breathing paused for a second.But quickly, he resumed his cold and sarcastic smile.\u201cFine. You go arrange that with Siyi.\u201dHe suddenly turned around and was about to close the door behind him and block the rest of the world out.But, that was when he heard Gu Shishi\u2019s delicate voice from behind him.\u201cUmm, installment means the next 60\u2026 no, 70 years, 365 days a year, I\u2019d like to receive a red packet and gifts from you\u2026\u201dHuo Sishen almost stumbled.The crisp voice behind him was already sounding like a noise made by a mosquito.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Perhaps those were somewhat cute traits?And he was handsome, with good looking hands and a good looking face. His build wasn\u2019t half bad, and he could totally qualify to be her model.Plus, he was also her source of inspiration!Just a moment ago, when she was looking at him from outside his study, she seemed to have figured out the real meaning of painting!A picture can talk.Brightness versus darkness.White versus black.The image of him sitting inside his study, not saying a word, nor did he look at her. She clearly felt that he didn\u2019t belong in that lonely world. She saw the loneliness on him and his resentment toward her\u2026Would she be able to express all these emotions through a drawing paper with her paintbrush?The more Gu Shishi thought about it, the more she felt that her blood was boiling.That was the benefit of having the system.Perhaps all she needed was to use her cheat a few more times and she would be able to create work with souls like that all by herself.\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201dHuo Sishen\u2019s cold and fierce voice came roaring at her.\u201cDo you even know what you are talking about?\u201dHe had never heard such shameless words in his life!Gu Shishi, on the other hand, nodded and gave him a pitiful look.She had already said all the shameless words, what was a little more?\u201cI just want to be with you.

Naturally, they wouldn\u2019t want Huo Sishen, a human equivalent of bad luck, to attend.Yet when Gu Shishi heard it the night before, she almost busted out laughing.They were overthinking this too much; Boss Huo had no interest in attending this event at all!Never mind his pride and that he would never attend an event without being invited, even if he was invited, she gathered a homebody like him who didn\u2019t like to talk much would not want to attend a crowded event like this.Heck, he didn\u2019t even attend his own engagement party.So why would he attend someone else\u2019s birthday party?What would that do to his fiancee\u2019s reputation?[Don\u2019t worry.] Gu Shishi replied simply and closed out of WeChat.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Their abilities to plot and manipulate weren\u2019t even close!But now, Gu Wushuang had no idea that the inside of Gu Shishi had been swapped and still thought she could set her up, ho ho ho.She should watch out to come out in one piece!***The Cadillac quickly drove into the busy part of town and stopped in front of the private club La Rose.This private club looked to be very low-key from the outside.The outer wall was made out of black marble with occasional strands of embedded gold strands as decorations.And, it didn\u2019t have a very big sign, nor was the sign illuminated. There were just very small, low-key, raised red characters on the outside wall.They were barely noticeable compared to the 5-star hotel next door to them.If Gu Shishi didn\u2019t have the address and know that this was a private club, she\u2019d most likely had thought this was some office building.\u201cThe Chen\u2019s are so low key\u2026\u201dOne could usually tell the host\u2019s preference and style from the location and set up of their banquets.Gu Shishi all the more felt that the gift that she had picked up for old Mrs. Chen was perfect.She had chosen a piece of white amber. The body of it was full and rich, the pattern on it was smooth and natural. It was white throughout with no air bubbles.It felt a little chilly in one\u2019s hand and looked almost a little transparent under the light.In the middle of it, there was a yellow strand that spread outward. If one looked closely, one would notice that it looked like a phoenix flying out of the clouds. Not only did it not affect the completeness of the white amber, it added a lot of content to it!She had gone to quite a few shops after work before she was finally able to find this.The piece might look low-key at first glance, but it was actually quite valuable.The white amber itself wasn\u2019t cheap. It cost her $1,000, a bargain in and of itself nonetheless.From her valuation from her experience being with her master, she gathered it was worth around $5,000.She trusted this gift would be of old Mrs. Chen\u2019s liking.As she was thinking about that, she bid farewell to Mr. Chen, the chauffeur, and walked toward the front entrance of the private club.She didn\u2019t expect to be stopped by the server after she had only taken a couple steps in her low heels.\u201cHi, Miss. This is a private event today. May we ask you for your invitation?\u201dGu Shishi was a little stunned.Gu Wushuang did not send her an invitation.Another one of her silly little tricks?Gu Shishi smiled.\u201cJust one second.\u201dDid she want her to be shamed by being stopped at the door and not allowed to enter?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I am here now. Can you come and get me?\u201dShe has no shame in asking.Since Gu Wushuang liked little tricks so much, she could take a few extra steps and come and get her!Soon, a soft and tender voice came from the other end.\u201cOh, Shishi. I\u2019m sorry, I forgot to send you the invitation. Just give them my name and they will let you in.\u201dGu Shishi pursed her lips.\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea. I didn\u2019t have the proper invitation after all.\u201cIf I come inside myself, it\u2019d seem like I have invited myself.\u201dSilence from the other end of the phone.\u201cIt\u2019s all electronic invitation now. Let me forward it to you via WeChat.\u201dOh, yeah?Why didn\u2019t she send it sooner then?Gu Shishi couldn\u2019t help but snicker to herself.\u201cAye, I was hoping you can come and get me so I won\u2019t walk the wrong direction. And if I run into anyone on the way, you will be able to introduce us so I wouldn\u2019t seem rude.\u201cOr, I can give mom a call as well.\u201dThe original owner\u2019s real mom wasn\u2019t all that fond of the original owner. She didn\u2019t believe Gu Wushuang had nothing to do with that.Sure enough, as soon as she mentioned Mrs. Gu, Gu Wushuang\u2019s reaction was almost instantaneous.\u201cWait there. I am on my way.\u201dGu Shishi lifted her brows.It looked like Gu Wushuang had a lot to do with the minimal contact between the original owner and her mother.As much as the original owner was her real daughter, if she didn\u2019t raise her for 20 years plus a lack of contact, they would never have a relationship with each other.It\u2019d be awkward and distant for the both of them whenever they meet and that\u2019d only get worse with each additional time that they saw each other.And they\u2019d get more and more distance from each other.This little white flower was surely some character.Gu Shishi squinted.\u201cOh, okay. Hurry up. I don\u2019t want to stand outside and have to explain to other visitors why I was standing here because I didn\u2019t receive an invitation.\u201dOh yeah, little girl. Was that how you wanted to do it?She could take her time if she didn\u2019t care about her letting others know that she withheld the invitation on purpose and had her waited outside!Sure enough, Gu Wushuang arrived in less than 2 minutes in quick steps. Winded, her cheeks pink with a hint of paleness, and her hand was clutching her chest.\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Shishi. I didn\u2019t think about waiting at the front to go inside with you.\u201dHer limpid eyes looked apologetic.\u201cNo worries. Let\u2019s go.\u201dGu Shishi immediately passed her and walked in front of her.Someone happened to walk past and gave them a couple additional looks.Gu Wushuang\u2019s hand that was clutching her chest balled into a fist immediately!A shred of shame flashed past her red lips.She hadn\u2019t expected Gu Shishi to have her come to fetch her.What would others think when they saw her going to get Gu Shishi?That was clearly a message that the fake daughter must make way for the real daughter!!Gu Wushuang\u2019s breathing became heavier.\u201cShuangshuang, I\u2019ve told you not to run, but you wouldn\u2019t listen! See, your chest is tightening again, right?\u201dA delicate-looking girl in a dress with golden sequins came running out and held onto Gu Wushuang as she turned and gave Gu Shishi a reproachful look.\u201cYou knew that Shuangshuang didn\u2019t have the best of health and yet you\u2019ve made her come and get you. Who does that?\u201dGu Shishi was yelled at immediately!\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Pingting.. it wasn\u2019t Shishi\u2019 fault. I said I\u2019d go and get her. After all, she wasn\u2019t familiar with this place and was nervous\u2026.\u201dGu Wushuang leaned against the shoulder of the girl in a long dress as though she was about to cry.\u201cShuangshuang! She was trying to kill you so she can have all the inheritance. You don\u2019t need to be that nice to her!\u201dLuo Pingting hugged Gu Wushuang like a hen protecting her chick and stared at Gu Shishi angrily.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that.

The Chen\u2019s personal doctor will take a look at you.\u201d\u201cShuangshaung, you are too na\u00efve. You shouldn\u2019t hang around a certain someone.

She pretty much lied through her teeth and just made up untruthful stuff!Gu Wushuang had only sobbed a little, clutched her chest, and gasped a couple times, and everyone immediately thought Gu Shishi was there to take over the Gu\u2019s inheritance!Gu Shishi put on a smile, waved her hand a little, and said, \u201cShuangshuang, I know you said you\u2019d introduce me to the others, but there\u2019s really no need for everyone to come and greet me at the entrance!\u201d\u201cWho did you say is here to greet you?\u201d\u201cHow imprudent!\u201dThe corners of Gu Wushuang\u2019s mouth twitched a few times.Gu Shishi, on the other hand, gave her an innocent look and asked, \u201cHave I said something wrong?\u201d\u201cYou are not welcome here!\u201d\u201cExactly, you should leave!\u201dGu Wushuang smiled subtly. Nobody caught onto that.She was just about to feign some words to the others when Gu Shishi injected, \u201cHave I said anything wrong?\u201dGu Shishi pursed her lips and gave a look of genuine innocence.\u201cIt seemed I had only said one thing since I walked in, but for some reason everybody seemed to be very hostile towards me?\u201cShuangshuang, should I not have asked you to come get me? But haven\u2019t you told me that we are like sisters and I can ask you for anything? I didn\u2019t know you were going to rush over. But if you have a heart condition, you should have told me and send someone else to get me.\u201cOr perhaps, I shouldn\u2019t have come today at all. But you were adamant that I came today and you even told me that Miss Chen really wanted to meet me\u2026\u201dGu Wushuang was a little stunned.Gu Shishi\u2019s words seemed like a simple gripe at first, but something seemed to be a little off with what she had said.It was true that Gu Shishi had not done anything wrong since she had walked in.She was attacked because everybody had a bad impression of her.But if one followed that logic\u2026 Why was it that even those whom she had never met before also had a bad impression about her\u2026 thinking about it some more, the only explanation was that someone had bad mouthed her previously!And who would have spread the rumors that Gu Shishi was a horrible person and had bullied Gu Wushuang and wanted to fight her over the Gu\u2019s inheritance?It didn\u2019t take Gu Wushuang very long to figure out the subtext of Gu Shishi\u2019s words!Naturally, rumors came from those who had witnessed the events, or someone who stood to have something to gain from it!Any intelligent person could come to the conclusion that Gu Wushuang was the source of that!Gu Wushuang bit her lips with pink lipstick hard.She hadn\u2019t expected Gu Shishi to be so sharp with her words and turned the table on her so quickly!While Gu Wushuang was analyzing all those things and before she was able to come up with any rebuttal, Gu Shishi cut her off again.\u201cOh, right, Wushuang. Why didn\u2019t you stay home and get some rest if you aren\u2019t feeling well?

You know when it comes to heart disease, sometimes just a few minutes can make the difference between life and death!\u201dHaving said that, Gu Shishi peeled Luo Pingting off of her.\u201cMiss Pingting, please help me get through to Wushuang. Her health is the most important issue here.\u201d\u201cOh, Mr. Chen, my sister needs to go to the hospital. Please bring the car around and take her to Guo Li, the best hospital!\u201dGu Shishi immediately called her chauffeur.Gu Wushuang had finally turned completely pale.\u201cI really am fine now. See? I don\u2019t have any difficulty with breathing anymore!\u201dHowever, she had played the role of a fragile, sick girl in front of everyone for way too long.Many of the girls there were hesitant even after she had said that.Even Luo Pingting, her best friend, was shaken from Gu Shishi\u2019s bombardment of \u201clife and death matter\u201d, \u201cevery minute matters\u201d, and 'should go and get checked out at the hospital\u201d.None of the other girls dare say a word about not going to the hospital.Gu Wushuang, with no help at all, was no rival to Gu Shishi.They were both girls, but Gu Wushuang was used to being pampered and didn\u2019t have much exercise.Gu Shishi was raised in a regular family after all. She had plenty of experience doing housework and work. She lifted her arm and started dragging Gu Wushuang toward the exit.None of the other rich girls even had the time to react to that.Gu Wushuang was completely stunned silent!She didn\u2019t recollect herself until she had already been shoved into the back seat by Gu Shishi. It was only after Gu Shishi had told the chauffeur to get her to the hospital as quickly as possible that she recovered. Gu Wushuang flipped her wrist and quickly grabbed onto Gu Shishi\u2019s lower arm.\u201cShishi, you\u2026\u201dGu Shishi wasn\u2019t going to give her the opportunity to talk again!\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will relate your birthday greetings to old Mrs. Chen. Oh yeah, in order to not upset her, I\u2019ll just let her know that it was that time of the month and you had blood stains on your skirt and was in a lot of pain.\u201dGu Wushuang\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cI\u2019ll go visit you in the hospital after I wish old Mrs. Chen a happy birthday.

I\u2019ll let your best friend Miss Luo accompany you to the hospital.\u201dAfter Gu Shishi was done talking, she slammed the door shut immediately with a smile on her face!Mr. Chen floored the gas immediately after Gu Shishi had told him that he needed to get the heart patient to the hospital as quickly as possible.The car sped away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Quickly, lean your head against the headrest, close your eyes, and take a deep breath\u2026\u201dLuo Pingting was quick to take care of Gu Wushuang.Gu Wushuang curved her lips with difficulty and forced a smile on her face.She had always faked being sick and enjoyed the feeling of being pampered.Then why was it that something just didn\u2019t sound right today?But, thinking about that big-busted, airhead Chen Kexin, she smiled again happily.\u201cAlright.\u201d***Right now, inside the classy bathroom of the private club.Gu Shishi was sitting on the leather seat, humming as she reapplied her makeup.She was quite proud of herself for sending away both Gu Wushuang and her best friend as one package.She almost wanted to give herself a thumbs up and tip her hat off to her own ability to strategize.No choice, she was, after all, a woman who only has 7 days of life!She was not afraid of anything else!Just when she was feeling ecstatic and was about to send the boss a text telling him that she had already arrived at old Mrs. Chen\u2019s banquet, she heard a unfamiliar but clear and bright young female voice from behind her.\u201cSo you are the Gu Shishi who stole Wushuang\u2019s parents and even sent away Zhang-ma?\u201dGu Shishi turned and looked. All she saw was a big chested pretty girl with an oval-shaped, delicate face. She had on a pastel-colored, 1-shoulder evening gown and standing behind her in her full glory.The pretty girl, however, was looking at her hostilely.Her words had a hint of anger in them too.\u201cDo you know that it\u2019s very despicable to be manipulative?\u201dGu Shishi lifted her brows and appreciated her pretty look.

Gu Shishi?!The one that Pingting had contacted her to make fun of at the banquet? That Gu Shishi?How could that be?How could there be such a coincidence?She had just heard that as soon as Gu Shishi arrived at the banquet venue, she had made Wushuang fall ill. And, Wushuang had to rush to the hospital and couldn\u2019t even attend the celebratory banquet.She had planned to avenge her friend and picked a fight with Gu Shishi.But\u2026 she\u2019s the same one as the guru?!Chen Kexin\u2019s face changed colors.Guru\u2019s strokes in her ink painting were so smooth and natural, and the artistic conception was impeccable.In her mind, the oil painting guru was someone out of this world.In fact, she was above everything worldly and spit on money like it was dirty; she didn\u2019t even care about the $10,000 red packet that she had offered her.The Gu\u2019s were well off, but would the oil painting guru fight right over the inheritance with Wushuang?She bullied the fragile Wushaung and even chased away their old servant because of some minor conflict?How was that possible?All these thoughts raced through Chen Kexin\u2019s mind in the matter of seconds.The more she thought about it, the less it made any sense!All the words that she had wanted to confront her with, she couldn\u2019t force any of them out.\u201cChen\u2026 Chen Kexin\u2026 is my name.\u201dFinally, it turned into a self-introduction.\u201cMm.\u201d Gu Shishi smiled and nodded. \u201cIf I am guessing it correctly, you are the Miss of the Chen\u2019s? Wushaung told me you were the one who invited me here today and that you wanted to meet me.\u201dChen Kexin blushed immediately. Her purpose wasn\u2019t really wanting to meet Gu Shishi.She had just graduated and returned from overseas and immediately heard from Pingting that Uncle Gu found their biological daughter, Gu Shishi. But, that peasant girl wanted to kick out their good friend Wushuang so she could have all the inheritance.She was so upset after she heard that.Pingting then suggested for her to invite Gu Shishi to the banquet and that\u2019s where they\u2019d show her what was upper class and the difference between them and her.She has taken that on righteously.Their plan was to isolate and ignore Gu Shishi today and let Gu Shishi learn she was not a guest that was welcomed by the host. And that she was not welcomed in their circle!\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dThinking of that, Chen Kexin\u2019s ears started to burn again.She had thanked her profusely on WeChat the last couple of days. She even watched her live streaming two more times and boasted about her painting skills.But, somehow, she turned out to be Gu Shishi, the one she had invited over and was also the target of their plot!Chen Kexin felt that she saw blackness in front of her eyes.This must be a joke from some supernatural powers\u2026.She was going to make fun of the person that she was just boasting about the day before.Wasn\u2019t that the same as slapping her own face?\u201cI\u2026I need to greet another friend. Pardon me!\u201dChen Kexin was confused and had no idea how she should interact with Gu Shishi.Gu Shishi\u2019s lips curved upward.\u201cSure, I\u2019ll look for you in a bit.\u201dChen Kexin almost slipped on the floor.

The few times that they had chatted on WeChat, she had sent her all sorts of emojis to show how much she looked up to her\u2026It was obvious that she was a nice girl who was well protected by her family.She was na\u00efve and not manipulative.She just needed time to see who was in the right and who wasn\u2019t.Quickly, Gu Shishi arrived at the banquet hall located on the second floor.The banquet was served in buffet style today.Everybody was standing around the banquet hall and chatting with those around them.This was, no doubt, heaven for those who were good at socializing.As long as they wanted to, they could walk in between all of the upper classes madams and misses and chat with any or all of them.One could earn quite a bit of brownie points over the course of just one meal.Gu Shishi looked around and certainly spotted many like that.There were also plenty of smaller tables placed around the perimeter of the venue. Most of them were taken by older housewives as they rest and socialized at the same time.She attracted plenty of attention the minute she walked inside of the banquet hall.Gu Shishi was, doubtless, a pretty girl.She had on a light-yellow colored dress today that made her look even more like a voluptuous and delicate flower bud. Her skin was white like snow. If one looked close enough, it was almost glowing. She was flawless from head to toe.Her cheeks were smooth and shiny like a peeled egg and her brows were elegant and beautiful. Her eyes were limpid, and her lips were delicate like an apricot.Yet, not one person came up to greet her.Everybody in the banquet hall looked at her. Some of them were stunned by her beauty and others were envious of her. Quickly, they exchanged a few words with those around them, showed a look of either insight or contempt, then they turned away from her.It didn\u2019t take long before Gu Shishi fully understood the meaning of \u201cnot belonging\u201d.There were at least 40 ~ 50 people at the venue, but she didn\u2019t know any of them.Nor would any one of them approach her.Alienation was clearly written on everyone\u2019s face.She was just about to walk over to the buffet table when she heard a vexed voice from an elegant middle-aged woman.\u201cShishi, your little sister Wushuang is ill?\u201dShe turned around and saw a pretty woman wrapped in a lavender cheongsam along with a reddish purple embroidered shawl walking toward her quickly with a worried look on her.That was Zheng Wen, Mrs. Gu.The birth mother of this body.It only took Gu Shishi a second to recall who she was.But the very next second, Mr. Gu turned pale already. Clutching her purse tightly, she said, \u201cShishi, your father and I are going to check on Wushuang in the hospital. You stay here and spend some time with Miss Chen.\u201dShe didn\u2019t even wait for Gu Shishi to answer before she walked away in her stilettos, quickly wrapped her arm around a slightly solemn-looking and chubby middle-aged man\u2019s arm, and left with him without ever looking back.Gu Shishi, as much as she had fully anticipated this, could do nothing but smile wryly.Just one second of meeting and one line, and they had already left.They ditched their real daughter to go check on their adoptive one.Gu Zhengxin, her birth father, never even walked up to her or spoke to her.The \u201cDad\u201d and \u201cMom\u201d that Gu Shishi had been mulling over had already disappeared into thin air. She didn\u2019t have parents in her previous life; she was adopted and raised by her master. She had also taken on his last name, Gu. She thought she had it bad as an orphan, and she never imagined that the original owner had it worse than her.Her birth parents were right there, but they acted like they didn\u2019t see her at all.They didn\u2019t even think twice before leaving her even though they knew that she didn\u2019t know another soul there. They didn\u2019t even bother asking if she wanted to leave with them.The original owner had it much worse than she did!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What was she doing?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 95 \u2013 Helping Gu Shishi meant turning her back on Wushuang. What was she doing?!However, Gu Shishi only felt sorry for the original owner for a brief few seconds.She was attracted by the sumptuous buffet area the very next moment.Sashimi, abalone, king crab legs\u2026 fried chicken, steak, hearty cream soup\u2026 dessert area with chocolate fondue and all sorts of little pastries\u2026Then there was crystal shrimp dumpling, soup dumpling, dessert buns\u2026 all sorts of fried noodles and fried rice and other steamy dishes\u2026Gu Shishi couldn\u2019t help but felt hunger.Her master had also restrained her to spend most of her time practicing at home. Buffets were something she had always looked forward to but rarely ever had.Looking at the dazzling variety of food, she quickly grabbed a dinner plate! Even the speed she was walking in was twice her normal! Did she care about being alienated? Heck, no! Why would she even care about the others when there\u2019s so much delicacies in front of her?Excitedly, she calculated the calories in her head, weighing that against the volume of her stomach and started picking and choosing.If she ate too much during lunch time, she wouldn\u2019t be able to eat enough at night to fill up her life bar. So she couldn\u2019t overeat!As she mumbled to herself, Gu Shishi reached the area with sashimi, which she hasn\u2019t any recently. She had just gotten two crawfish before someone bumped into her forcefully.As she was carrying a dinner plate in her hand, she lost her balance and started falling down to one side.Right then, red wine from the person who bumped into her came pouring down.\u201cOh!\u201d The girl who spilled the red wine let out a scream.The interaction between the two of them quickly attracted attention around them.\u201cHey! Isn\u2019t that the girl that the Gu\u2019s had brought back?\u201d\u201cMaybe she\u2019s never worn heels before? That\u2019s why she bumped into someone while holding a dinner plate?\u201d\u201cPeasants are so clumsy\u2026\u201d\u201cOh mi, that\u2019s so embarrassing!\u201dSuddenly, a group of pampered young misses started commenting on the situation.Gu Shishi was completely baffled. She looked down and saw that the other party had poured her entire glass of wine onto her dress. The light yellow fabric now had a large patch of wine stain on it.\u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201dThe girl with the red wine apologized immediately. But it was obvious from the upward curve of her lips and her eyes that she was not apologetic at all.\u201cYour dress is stained. I can have my chauffeur take you home to change?\u201dChen Kexin was carrying her dinner plate and watching this unfolded from across. She bit her lips and wasn\u2019t sure if she should say something. That was their agreed upon second move. Alienate Gu Shishi and has no help after her dress was stained.They wanted to make her cry!But\u2026 right now, seeing the girls she had always hung out with now all surrounding and chuckling at Gu Shishi, Chen Kexin was struggling inside herself. After Gu Shishi was pranked, she didn\u2019t seem anxious at all. There was just a slight look of sarcasm on her face.As though she had already seen through all their tricks. And, looking back at her friends, they looked rude and rash like clowns\u2026Why did she feel that Gu Shishi was the classy one here right now? She watched as Gu Shishi put down her plate, said something to a server, and walked over the bathroom by herself. She gritted her teeth and followed.Before she even walked inside of the restroom, she could see Gu Shishi trying hard at scrubbing at her dress.She couldn\u2019t help but blurt out, \u201cIt won\u2019t work. Wine stain won\u2019t come out.\u201dShe looked regretful as soon as she had said that. Why was she helping the enemy of her friend? But the very next second, the image of the rotund orange tabby playing with the butterfly popped into her head. She had been dreaming of her tabby the last few days.Thinking of that, she couldn\u2019t control her mouth again. \u201cI have a spare dress inside the resting area.\u201dHaving said that, Chen Kexin bit her lip tightly again! She was experiencing inner struggles, embarrassment, and regret. Helping Gu Shishi meant turning her back on Wushuang. What was she doing?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96 - Failed!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 96 \u2013 Failed!However, Gu Shishi didn\u2019t seem to notice the complex emotions Chen Kexin was experiencing.She stopped her action of trying to wipe the wine stain with dry paper towels and turned and looked at Chen Kexin. Her lips curved upward and she said, \u201cAren\u2019t your friends going to complain about you helping me?\u201dChen Kexin felt a burning sensation on her cheeks all of a sudden. Sure enough, Gu Shishi had seen through them long time ago. She knew they had planned to prank her all along!\u201cI am also a host today. It\u2019s my job to help you out.\u201d Chen Kexin took a deep breath and told that to herself. \u201cYou are my guest no matter what.\u201dRight. She was not betraying her friend. She was merely doing what was appropriate as the Miss of the Chen\u2019s! Once she figured that out, the pressure on her was lifted and the smile from before had returned.\u201cCome with me.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s alright,\u201d smiled Gu Shishi. \u201cBut thanks anyway, MeowMeow.\u201dChen Kexin blushed immediately as soon as she said the nickname again. It\u2019s so embarrassing to be using her online alias in real life!\u201cMiss, you asked for a pair of scissors?\u201d A female server came inside and interrupted their conversation.\u201cYes, thank you,\u201d said Gu Shishi as she took the pair of scissors from the server.Chen Kexin, who was just about to leave, stopped on her way. Her eyes widened the next second!Gu Shishi, with the pair of scissors in hand, grabbed the hem of the dress that she had just dried a little, and snipped off a big chunk of the stained fabric!She had snipped away a big triangular shape of fabric and her white flesh was exposed starting from the middle of the right thigh downward.Chen Kexin gasped.\u201cHow\u2026 how are you going to walk out like this?\u201dGu Shishi smiled and didn\u2019t say a word. She opened up her purse and pulled out a pink Armani scarf. She had brought it with her to wrap it around her neck in case the air conditioning was too strong. She didn\u2019t need it right away so she folded it into a triangular shape and also took off her pearl pendant earrings.She placed the scarf where the fabric was missing on her dress. And, where they met, she pushed the earrings in and snapped them shut!Almost instantaneously, the part of the dress that was missing fabric was replaced with her pink scarf. And on both sides, they were decorated by the two pendant earrings at different heights.Standing in front of the full-length mirror, Gu Shishi walked around in a circle once and nodded satisfactorily.She turned and smiled at Chen Kexin, whose cherry-like mouth was dropped open right now and said, \u201cThink it will work, MeowMeow?\u201dAs she walked, the scarf would be seen from time to time. The combination between the pink and the light yellow added a thick feel of feminism that wasn\u2019t there before.In addition, the pearl pendant earrings also drew a lot of attention, making it difficult to look away. They further made her legs look straighter, slender, and an attractive kind of pale.Chen Kexin was stunned. \u201cUm\u2026 yeah\u2026. I guess\u2026.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s go. I must go thank the girl who bumped into me accidentally and spilled the wine on me.\u201dGu Shishi\u2019s lips curved upward. Ruining her dress was such a clich\u00e9 move. She wondered whether it came from Gu Wushuang or one of her friends. Such a low-level trick!\u201cI\u2019ve always felt that this dress was a little lacking.\u201d Gu Shishi threaded her arm around the stoned Chen Kexin and took her out of the restroom with her. \u201cI must thank her for my inspiration. I just realized that matching clothes is just like drawing, supports come after primary and movements among tranquility.\u201dChen Kexin, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAs someone who knew all about their plans to prank her, she felt her cheeks burning up in flame! \u201cSupports coming after primary\u201d sounded like a sarcasm aimed at her. She was the host today but she was part of the pranksters, that was over the top! Chen Kexin couldn\u2019t even walk straight.When the two young women went back to the banquet hall, and Gu Shishi\u2019s outfit immediately attracted the attention of all the stuck-up girls.Some of the male guests even looked at Gu Shishi more passionately than before, particularly focusing on the hem of her dress.The girl that Gu Shishi thanked was so angry that her face turned red and white. She was furious! Not only did their prank not work on Gu Shishi, she had turned the situation around entirely. The second prank was a total failure.Those stuck-up girls exchanged a look with each other.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97 - Meeting Grandma ChenPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySoon, a beauty in a black, single-shoulder dress carrying a glass of champagne approached Gu Shishi with a snicker.\u201cMiss Gu, I wonder what you have prepared for Grandma Chen\u2019s birthday today. Shuangshuang told us that you have prepared a big surprise for Grandma Chen.\u201dAs soon as she finished talking, a group of older ladies walked toward them from not too far away.In the middle of them, there was an elegant-looking old lady with a carved cane.The old lady has silver-colored hair and a gentle smile. She had on a dark red cardigan dress and appeared very authoritative. And, she was the birthday star today.\u201cGrandma Chen!\u201dThe rich girl who was obviously there to stir things up called out sweetly.\u201cWe were just talking about this present that Miss Gu had prepared for you from a long time ago.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Old Mrs. Chen squinted and smiled at Gu Shishi.\u201cYou are Miss Gu? You are quite pretty. You take after your parents and then some.\u201d Her words were appropriate and friendly.Everyone in the circle knew that Gu Shishi was brought back. But for someone of Old Mrs. Chen\u2019s age, biological descendents were the most important thing. Gu Shishi was the birth daughter of the Gu\u2019s. Old Mrs. Chen wouldn\u2019t place any importance on the relationship between Gu Shishi and Gu Wushuang.She looked at her own granddaughter standing behind Gu Shishi.\u201cKexin, you are a friend of Miss Gu? Why didn\u2019t you introduce the two of us?\u201dFeeling a bit embarrassed, Chen Kexin took two steps forward and said, \u201cGrandma.\u201dWhat was there to introduce?That was the third prank that they had agreed upon. They wanted to embarrass Gu Shishi, who didn\u2019t understand any of the upper-class etiquettes, publicly.There was no way a peasant girl could pick the right present with no help at all. Giving a gift that was too inexpensive would not reflect their own status and also could be construed as offensive to the birthday star. And if the gift was too expensive, it could be viewed as nouveau riche showing off their riches. That\u2019d be a low move.An individual truly from wealth would not only be wealthy, but also be cultured.A gift to someone of the older generation must represent the thought of oneself and also be of the appropriate price range. It was way more complicated than the normal health products, fruits among the commoners!Thinking about that, Chen Kexin smiled bitterly.If Gu Shishi was truly the guru who drew the \u201cFour Sons Offering Up Mythical Peachers\u201d, then\u2026 her taste was definitely not that of a peasant\u2019s!Pingting and the group might have taken it too much for granted.\u201cMiss Gu, quickly. Show us what you\u2019ve got!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. We can\u2019t wait any longer!\u201d\u201cEh? You didn\u2019t forget to bring something, did you?\u201dAll of a sudden, everybody was cheering on. It was obvious that they were all waiting for the drama to unfold.Neither Gu Wushuang, nor Father and Mother Gu reminded her of any etiquettes before the banquet.In fact, they never mentioned anything about preparing gifts to her.If it was the original owner, she\u2019d very likely assumed that she was a part of the Gu\u2019s and not bring anything herself.But even though she wasn\u2019t officially wedded yet, this was her first appearance. Had she came empty-handed, that would surely be a very big social faux pas.It would be an equivalent of making an announcement at this banquet that even though she was a Gu\u2019s by blood, she knew no etiquettes and didn\u2019t remotely measure up to Gu Wushuang, the adopted daughter. Nobody could have anticipated that the original owner had already been swapped out inside!\u201cHappy birthday to you, Grandma Chen!\u201d Gu Shishi smiled, walked up, and congratulatory words rolled out of her smoothly.She opened up her little purse under the stare of everyone who was waiting for drama.Slowly, she pulled out a small and delicate wooden box.The object wasn\u2019t very big but as soon as she produced it, all the sarcastic voices disappeared all of a sudden!The little wooden box might look very generic, but where there should be a metal lock was a delicate Chinese knot.The little wooden box was just the size of a palm, but the Chinese knot was tied with thin, red strings into the size of a nail. It stood out a lot.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98 - A seemingly imperfect patternPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayImmediately, Chen Kexin let out a sigh of relief.Then, an odd look followed.Why did she let out a sigh of relief?Was she worried about Gu Shishi?Whose side was she on?Chen Kexin looked hesitant and conflicted.While she was deep in thought, another round of snickering hit her ears.\u201cSo Miss Gu\u2019s gift was a piece of white jade?\u201d\u201cEh? There seemed to be some yellow discolorations inside of this piece of white jade\u2026\u201dAll sorts of chuckling were coming from all over.Chen Kexin looked over as well.As it turned out, Old Mrs. Chen had already opened up the wooden box as everybody looked on.Inside the box, there was a smooth-looking, pebble-sized piece of white jade.Chen Kexin couldn\u2019t help but frown.Many of them grew up with plenty of gemstones and had a certain level of knowledge about them.Especially her grandmother, who had always been an enthusiast of jades and emeralds.The value of white jade was rated by the pureness of its color as well as the transparency of their pattern.The one that Gu Shishi had brought had yellow within it and would not be considered as top notched.Plus the size of it wasn\u2019t very big, it probably valued around $2,000.It wasn\u2019t a shabby gift under a normal situation.But this was Gu Shishi\u2019s first appearance since she had returned to her prominent family; plus, she was the fianc\u00e9e of the oldest Huo\u2019s son.As the oldest daughter and oldest daughter-in-law, this gift was merely alright.It did not sufficiently show her thoughtfulness, and the price tag was also a bit on the low side.Chen Kexin looked over at her grandmother and noticed the disappointment in her look.Their cheering from earlier had raised her grandmother\u2019s expectation.And now, the gift did not live up to her expectation!This would most likely not gain her grandmother\u2019s favor and respect, and possibly even lower her impression for Gu Shishi.Chen Kexin couldn\u2019t help but sigh as she looked at the piece of white jade.\u201cEh?\u201dChen Kexin noticed something else about the piece of white jade!The yellow pattern within the white jade seemed a little peculiar\u2026She squinted and looked again closely and her mouth dropped open!The pattern looked a lot like\u2026. A dancing phoenix!Phoenix, the king of all birds, immortal and indestructible and could be rebirthed.That would be the perfect birthday gift for her grandmother!!\u201cMiss Gu, we\u2019ve heard that you\u2019ve spent a long time in preparing this piece of white jade. Say, how much time have you spent looking for it?\u201d\u201cHaha, she might have been fooled. This doesn\u2019t look like the best of quality.\u201dMockery continued on from all directions.Chen Kexin felt a headache all over again and she even blushed.The others were standing further away and couldn\u2019t get a good look of it.And her grandmother has nearsightedness, so she didn\u2019t notice it right away either.Looking at the calm and composed Gu Shishi, Chen Kexin could help but felt resigned and respectful at the same time.All the ways that they have come up with to prank Gu Shishi had failed\u2026.\u201cGrandma, you should put your glasses on and take a closer look.\u201d Finally Chen Kexin couldn\u2019t help but add.Her grandmother would have noticed it sooner or later anyway.This seemingly imperfect pattern did not ruin the overall esthetics of the white jade, but it gave it the best of all meaning.Old Mrs. Chen was just about to thank Gu Shishi and leave, but hearing her granddaughter\u2019s words, she stopped.\u201cOh? Is there something special about this piece of white jade?\u201dOld Mrs. Chen couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cAlright, let me put on my glasses and take a closer look.\u201dThe crowd had not yet processed what was going on in the next few seconds.But Old Mrs. Chen had already seen it.The yellow pattern was not added artificially as it wasn\u2019t too defined and it didn\u2019t look exactly like a phoenix. But the joy of it was exactly to try and figure out the naturally occurring pattern and also the appreciation of the collector.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Meaning, if her granddaughter could see a phoenix, so could she. In fact, the more she looked at it, the more she thought it resembled a phoenix!\u201cExcellent. So there was more to it. The way this phoenix was flying straight up, so thriving and spirited. It also signifies rising into the sky at the same time\u2026.\u201dImmediately, Old Mrs. Chen was full of smiles and pleasantly surprised.To her, the value of the item was of no importance. She didn\u2019t lack any jewellery or gems. When it came to gems or paintings, it was all about appreciation for the next level of esthetics.To put it bluntly, it was all about the pet peeve of a collector \u2013 she had what others didn\u2019t!Being able to receive such a lucky white gem with a phoenix-like pattern on her birthday brought a huge smile onto her face.\u201cAh, Miss Gu is young, pretty, and also has good taste. Very exceptional. Keke, you should spend more time with Miss Gu and learn from her.\u201dHer one sentence made those attending the event change colors!The Chen\u2019s was a big family in this city.They were arguably ranked #2 after the Huo\u2019s.Many families attending the birthday celebration needed to build and maintain good relationships with the Chen\u2019s. All the wives and misses would do anything within their means to maintain their relationships with the women of the Chen\u2019s.Gu Shishi, the object of their pranks today, received the approval of Old Mrs. Chen just like that?What that meant was nobody could try to pull any more pranks on her during the birthday banquet today.Otherwise, they\u2019d be going against Old Mrs. Chen!Gu Shishi, on the other hand, smiled normally and shook her hand. \u201cGrandma Chen, I am glad you like it. It was all meant to be. I didn\u2019t spend too much time picking it out. I found it almost right away.\u201d\u201cHahaha, fate. Awesome!\u201dOld Mrs. Chen smiled so much that she couldn\u2019t even keep her mouth closed.Gu Shishi\u2019s flattery really nailed it. She was saying that Old Mrs. Chen was the phoenix in the crowd.All of a sudden, the way the others looked at Gu Shishi had become complicated and peculiar.Even with a hint of envious and fear!\u201cOh right, Keke, why don\u2019t you take out the \u2018Four Sons Offering Up Mythical Peaches\u2019 painting? Your Grandma Zhao and the others said they want to see it.\u201dOld Mrs. Chen remembered her painting. Smiling, she patted her granddaughter on her hand.\u201cI left it in the resting area.\u201dChen Kexin shuddered. She couldn\u2019t help but look over at Gu Shishi.Her grandmother couldn\u2019t hide the pride of having just gotten a great treasure.\u201cLet me tell you, that artist has some amazing skills and is most certainly some grand master but your Grandma Zhao won\u2019t believe me!\u201cHurry up and get it. I want to show the others!\u201dGrand master\u2026 amazing skills\u2026.Pingting, Wushuang, I am not sure I will be of much help.The enemy is just too mighty!\u201cUgh, o\u2026 okay.\u201dChen Kexin forced herself to respond to her grandmother\u2019s request.She returned before long.The painting had been mounted into a scroll.She had originally wanted to put it inside a glass frame as an ink painting was easy to mold and be damaged when exposed to open air but she was stopped by her grandmother after she had seen the painting. She insisted on having it mounted as a scroll. Chen Kexin did understand the reasoning behind it at the time. But now she got it.Her grandmother wanted to show off!A scroll was easy to carry around with for the purpose of showing off!Her grandmother had taken the painting two days ago, insisted that she wanted her birthday gift ahead of time and refused to give it back to her.It was hung up in the house, and nobody was allowed to touch it.But today\u2026 her grandmother had brought it with her to the club purposefully, obviously to show it to everyone!Chen Kexin\u2019s mouth twitched.\u201cOpen it up, Keke,\u201c smiled Old Mrs. Chen proudly.Resigned to her fate, Chen Kexin gritted her teeth and slowly unrolled the painting.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You will have to guess how much she paid for it.\u201dChen Kexin\u2019s heart skipped a beat again and couldn\u2019t help but look over at Gu Shishi.Her grandmother totally had a we-have-gotten-a-great-deal look on her!But the painter was standing right here, watching!While all sorts of thoughts were rushing through her head, the scroll has now been completely unrolled and laid out on the table that was wiped clean earlier.\u201cGASP\u2026.\u201dWhen they were only able to see a sliver of the painting, the few old ladies next to Old Mrs. Chen were merely nodding.Now that it was unrolled completely, they gasped loudly!\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d Old Mrs. Zhao, the one standing the closest, even leaned over for a better look.She was casually appreciating it at first but now the look on her had altered completely!In the painting, there were four kids of different sizes wearing belly bands and golden lockets. Some had little braids and others were bald\u2026Two of them carried a large mythical peach cheerfully. Cracking up with a big smile, a slightly taller kid was standing on top of a wooden stool. His chubby and lotus-like white arms reached out curiously and was about to pick a red peach from the tree.The last kid was bowing, as though he was saying something congratulatory.Every child has different expressions and movement, but all of them filled to the brim with celebratory cheerfulness!Old Mrs. Zhao rubbed her eyes and said, \u201cAm I seeing something? Why do I feel that this kid looks a little like my grandchild when he was a kid?\u201d\u201cEh? Zhao-jie, what a coincidence. I was just thinking the same thing!\u201d said Old Mrs. Zhang next to her. \u201cThis one that\u2019s climbing on the stool looks just like mine. He loved to climb trees when he was a kid. And this was the exact look that he\u2019d have on him. Oh, my lord! He looked just like him!\u201d\u201cMy granddaughter as well. She smiled just like that when she used to ask me for a red packet! Hahaha!\u201dThe few old ladies were all trying to talk over each other.Everybody else all felt amazed and looked over to study it carefully.The youngest third generation there, on the other hand, didn\u2019t care much about this painting.However, the slightly older parent generation individuals nodded in agreement.All the grandmothers and grandfathers of the same age as Old Mrs. Zhao all looked more and more surprised as time went on!\u201cRight? I felt the same. They looked a lot like my grandkids when they were little.\u201dOld Mrs. Chen smiled so much her eyes turned into a slit.The approval from her buddies really stroked her ego.\u201cThe minute I saw the painting, it immediately reminded me of Keke\u2019s first two years.

Contrarily, she focused her attention on the looks of the attendees.Quickly, she noticed that most of those who were subdued by her painting belonged to the grandmother tribe.Did that mean the \u201cLiving the Painting\u201d effect has to do with the subject of her painting?
