On both sides of the streets were towering buildings and there were plenty of restaurants and inns among them. The fragrant smell of the food cooked by the chefs was wafting through the air and lingered for a long period of time.Among the restaurants, the number one restaurant in the imperial city, the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant, was even more crowded, and its business was booming.Within the imperial city, the buildings were built in a neat and orderly fashion and alleyways were everywhere. If you were to follow the main road and walk past the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant, you would find a deep alley after walking for a few dozens of meters. Walking straight into the alleyway and turning left you would see a small and simple restaurant.There was a big black dog lying in front of the restaurant with its tongue hanging out. Inside the restaurant, there was not even a single customer.Suddenly, a young man walked out of the restaurant. He had a slim figure and fair skin. His long black hair, along with his fringe, was pulled back and tied into a ponytail with a thin and long wool rope. He gave off a feeling of neat and tidiness.\u201cBlacky, it\u2019s time to eat.\u201d The young man, Bu Fang, was holding a porcelain bowl as he walked out of the restaurant. He placed the bowl in front of the big black dog. The dog, who was formerly behaving lethargically, suddenly became energetic and started to devour the food in the bowl.After rubbing the silky and clean fur of the dog, Bu Fang smiled and walked back into the restaurant.Bu Fang, a twenty-year-old male, was an ordinary but ambitious chef from Earth. He suddenly woke up one day and found himself in another world, with the [Gourmet System] mysteriously appearing in his brain. The small restaurant was created by Bu Fang on the second day he arrived, with the help of the system.Even though a month had passed since he created the restaurant, not a single customer showed up, and Bu Fang had grown used to it. All he had to do everyday was follow the instructions of the [Gourmet System], which was to practice his cooking skills and to make sure to feed the big black dog.He had no idea where the big black dog came from, he only remembered that it appeared after a week the restaurant was built. The system reminded Bu Fang to periodically feed the dog with his practice ingredients. And so, every time the store opened, the dog would be waiting outside for Bu Fang to feed it.Strictly speaking, the big black dog was the first customer of Bu Fang, even though it was a freeloader.Once Bu Fang was back in the restaurant, he took a look at the empty place and sighed. Even though the restaurant was simple, it was neat and tidy. With an area of ten square meters and a few sets of tables and chairs, it was indeed a small restaurant.As he looked at the three dishes on the menu, Bu Fang could only helplessly give another long sigh.The menu was a piece of wood hung on a wall in the restaurant with only three dishes on it.It was hard to imagine what kind of a restaurant would only have three dishes on its menu, and the prices listed\u2026 could only be described as ridiculous.A portion of Stir-Fried Vegetables and Dry-Mixed Noodles were each priced at a hundred gold coins, while a bowl of Egg-Fried Rice was even more outrageous\u2026 it was actually priced at one crystal.Crystals were something that only cultivators had. A single crystal could be bought for around a thousand gold coins, but it was the kind of stuff where there was no availability.For a small restaurant, it was an unexpectedly ridiculous price.Bu Fang did not believe at all that anyone would be foolish enough to order a dish that expensive. Even though he would agree that the dishes were indeed delicacies when he tried them, when he looked at the prices\u2026 Bu Fang thought it was impossible.\u201cAs the God of Cooking who desires to stand at the top of the fantasy world, how could you not have your first customer? If you get your first customer within a month, you shall obtain a system reward.\u201dThat was a mission that the system gave him a few days after he created the restaurant, and there were only three days left until the deadline. Bu Fang looked at the empty alleyway expressionlessly.\u201cIt looks like my dream of becoming the God of Cooking will be destroyed before I can even take the first step.\u201d Bu Fang checked the time and sighed inwardly. He stood up, covered up the entrance with the door boards[1] and closed up the store.The dishes could not be brought out without permission, and there was a strict regulation on the opening hours. Even though the restaurant was small, there were lots of rules and regulations. However, as the regulations were set by the system, Bu Fang had to obey them.The restaurant was closed for the day. After locking up the restaurant, Bu Fang returned to the kitchen to practice his cooking. Actually, the so-called practice did not involve many technical aspects, it was just continuous cooking. Since the system would automatically refill the ingredients, Bu Fang only needed to cook.In a corner of the kitchen, there was a humanoid robot. This robot was created by the system to reclaim any food that Bu Fang made during practice. Other than the food that Bu Fang and the big black dog ate, the rest of the practice food had to be placed into the robot\u2019s stomach area.After Bu Fang started the fire, he began his daily cooking practice.Even though Bu Fang was in a fantasy world, the kitchen created by the system was identical to modern kitchens from Earth.All kinds of equipment were available: smokeless cooking pots, stainless steel knives, cutting boards, exhaust hood, microwave ovens, refrigerators\u2026 In fact, they were even more advanced than the ones on Earth. Bu Fang did not face any difficulties when using them, he even preferred cooking with them.As the night descended, the two moons in the sky were in harmony and the moonlight was like a veil in the sky.In front of the restaurant, the big black dog was lazing about in blissfulness after it finished its meal, accompanied by the chirping sound of insects as it guarded the store.The next morning, Bu Fang drowsily woke up. After he washed up, the restaurant was opened for business.The place was still deserted, and not a single soul could be seen. The big black dog was lying on the floor as usual.Bu Fang was suddenly envious of the booming business of the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant that was outside of the alleyway. Their business was simply too extraordinary, there were so many customers that it seemed that the entrance would be demolished.Bu Fang began to daydream about the day when his business was as successful as the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant.\u201cMy host, as the gourmet who desires to stand at the very top of the food chain in the fantasy world, you should not be envious of other restaurants. Work hard for the sake of your bright future!\u201dThe mechanical and serious voice of the system resounded in Bu Fang\u2019s head as a reminder. He was already used to it. During the past month, whenever he was envious of the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant, the system would automatically start encouraging him.Judging from its response, it seemed that the system was quite anthropomorphic.Bu Fang was sitting on a chair placed outside of the restaurant while enjoying the warm sunlight. He could not help but to slide downwards, so that he was curled up and lying on the chair in an extremely comfortable position.There was still not a single person appearing in the alleyway.\u201cAnother day without a single customer,\u201d Bu Fang thought out loud as he tilted his head and yawned.The big black dog was lying on the floor, it glanced at Bu Fang before it went back to whatever it was doing.Just when Bu Fang was about to fall asleep, a series of footsteps woke him up. He lazily opened his eyes and saw a handsome young man passing by. He was dressed in a tight outfit used for martial arts practice.\u201cHuh? There\u2019s actually someone stupid enough to set up a restaurant in an alleyway where almost no one would pass through?\u201dThe young man was actually good looking, he had an oval shaped face, expressive large eyes and red lips. If it was not for his flat chest and protruding adam\u2019s apple, Bu Fang would have mistaken him for a girl in disguise.It seemed to be a trope for girls in fantasy worlds to disguise themselves as males.The beautiful young man seemed to have taken an interest in the restaurant that was opened in an alleyway where no one passed by. He actually started to walk towards the restaurant.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHowever, Bu Fang did not get up, he still remained seated. Even though the other party had entered the restaurant, he was still not a customer as long as he had not made an order. Bu Fang knew that in order for someone to become a customer, they would first need to accept the ridiculous prices of the dishes.As expected, when the beautiful young man saw the prices on the menu, his originally large eyes became even larger, a piercing scream echoed throughout the silent alleyway.\u201cOh my god! A dish of Stir-Fried Vegetables costs a hundred gold coins? And a dish of Egg-Fried Rice actually costs one crystal? Have you gone insane from your greed?\u201d\u2014[1] door boards (\u95e8\u677f) \u2013 In ancient China, stores had wide entrances and they used wooden boards as doors instead of having a door. Every morning, the boards would be removed and placed aside. At the end of the day, they would be placed back onto the frames.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was still curled up on the chair with an empty gaze. He was actually looking at the system panel in his mind.System Objective: Help my host become the God of Cooking that stands at the top of the food chain in the fantasy worldHost: Bu FangTrue Energy Cultivation Level: None (As the God of Cooking in the fantasy world, you will definitely need to make use of the true energy when cooking.

Are you the owner of this restaurant?\u201d The handsome young man shouted angrily while he stared at Bu Fang.Bu Fang calmly glanced at the handsome young man, lazily got up and yawned.\u201cThe prices of the dishes in my restaurant are like that, you can leave if you can\u2019t accept it. My restaurant has always treated our customers fairly, we don\u2019t force anyone into buying anything.\u201dThe handsome young man was bewildered by Bu Fang\u2019s attitude. After a moment of confusion, his fair-looking face turned red and his eyes flashed with anger. He thought, \u201cIs that the kind of attitude a business owner should have?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 Look at the price of your dishes! How dare you even say that you treat your customers fairly, I bet you\u2019re just looking for a sucker to dupe! You scoundrel! Don\u2019t give me any excuses, I, Xiao Xiaolong, have already seen your true colors!\u201d\u201cDo I look like an idiot to you?\u201d Bu Fang replied, a little angry as well. As an ambitious chef with dreams, he hated it when others called him a scoundrel.\u201cI have my own reasons for setting it at that price. If you\u2019re not interested in ordering, you can always leave. I am not forcing you to stay.\u201dBu Fang felt unlucky. He had been waiting since morning and instead of a customer showing up, he had to deal with a troublesome sissy. He thought, \u201cWhy is it so difficult to run a business?\u201dThe handsome young man became even more testy. He crossed his arms and coldly stared at Bu Fang, \u201cHmph! Are you trying to goad me? You probably thought that I would be provoked into ordering a dish, right? Then you would have successfully fleeced me, you think I am an idiot!\u201dBu Fang was turned speechless by the handsome sissy in front of him. He headed towards his kitchen expressionlessly to begin his daily cooking practice.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong!? Are you feeling guilty? You have nothing to say now that I have revealed your sinister intentions! Let me tell you this, I, Xiao Xiaolong, am a great prodigy who hates injustice. I hate scoundrels like you the most.\u201d The handsome young man continued to stand there while hurling insults. However, even after waiting for a while, there was still no reply from Bu Fang.\u201cI will definitely make sure everyone in the imperial city knows about you! I will make sure your restaurant closes down! Oh\u2026 I don\u2019t even need to do that, anyone who sees your prices will think that you\u2019re an idiot!\u201dXiao Xiaolong was annoyed that he was being ignored, so he continued to threaten Bu Fang.Silence\u2026 The small restaurant became extremely quiet, but soon a smell wafted from the kitchen.Xiao Xiaolong stood there for a while, stared at the prices on the menu, finally the corner of his mouth twitched, he shook his head and decided to leave.For a plate of Stir-Fried Vegetables to be sold for a hundred gold coins, that was simply\u2026 insane!In the Light Wind Empire, the smallest currency unit was the copper coin. A silver coin was worth more than a copper coin, while a gold coin was worth the most. A single gold coin was more than enough for an ordinary family in the empire to survive for an entire month. A hundred gold coins\u2026 That was simply impossible for an ordinary person to afford!What was more, the Egg-Fried Rice actually needed a crystal! What was a crystal? It was a necessity to a cultivator, one crystal would be equivalent to a thousand gold coins!Only a madman would set a price like that!The furious Xiao Xiaolong turned around and walked towards the entrance of the restaurant. Suddenly, his nose twitched a little.\u201cIt smells good!\u201dA burst of smell had drifted from the kitchen and lingered around Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s nose. It was as if the smell had solidified and slid across his face like a piece of silk. It felt like a lover\u2019s caress, causing his entire body to shiver in pleasure.At last, Xiao Xiaolong found the source of the smell. He turned around and looked into the back of the kitchen. A slim figure holding a porcelain bowl in his fair hands emerged from the kitchen, as waves of rich fragrance continuously wafted from the bowl.\u201cAre you trying to tempt me? Hmph! No matter how delicious your cooking is, I won\u2019t be tricked!\u201dWhen Xiao Xiaolong saw Bu Fang walking towards him, he proudly raised his head and snorted coldly. Of course, were it not for his twitching nostrils giving him away, Bu Fang might really have thought he could not be tempted by delicious food.Finally, Xiao Xiaolong could not endure the temptation anymore and his stomach rumbled.\u201cSince you\u2019re sincerely offering me a taste of your food, then\u2026 I shall reluctantly have one bite.\u201dXiao Xiaolong turned his head towards Bu Fang and said. However, he was still speaking in a condescending tone, as if eating the food was a great honour for Bu Fang.However, in the next moment Xiao Xiaolong was shocked. Bu Fang did not stop in front of him, but instead he ignored him and walked toward the entrance.The confused Xiao Xiaolong was furious. He turned to stare at Bu Fang but the next scene enraged him even further.Bu Fang squatted down next to the big black dog at the entrance and placed the bowl filled with the delicious smelling food in front of it.\u201cBlacky, it\u2019s time to eat.\u201dBu Fang rubbed the smooth and clean fur of the dog and smiled.When Bu Fang saw that the lethargic dog suddenly became energetic and gobbled down the food he made, his smile grew even wider.Xiao Xiaolong felt as he was struck by lightning, he felt that Bu Fang had just humiliated him in the most outrageous manner!\u201cYou\u2026 You\u2026\u201dXiao Xiaolong\u2019s lips were trembling as he pointed towards Bu Fang with his long and feminine finger.\u201cHuh? You\u2019re still here?\u201d Bu Fang exclaimed in surprise.Bu Fang\u2019s exaggerated expression made Xiao Xiaolong feel as if an invisible arrow had pierced into his chest. He thought, \u201cOuch, it hurts!\u201dXiao Xiaolong\u2019s lips trembled in anger, he snorted and stamped his feet angrily, as if\u2026 he was a spoiled child and rushed out of the restaurant.\u201cThis sissy\u2026 has gone crazy.\u201dXiao Xiaolong had reached the entrance and was going to walk out, when his nose twitched once again. He unconsciously turned his head and looked inside of the porcelain bowl that the big black dog was eating from. The pearl-like rice grain wrapped in golden fried egg, it was so beautiful that it was like a work of art.However, at that very moment, the artistic Egg-Fried Rice was being eaten by a big black dog\u2026 A black dog\u2026 A dog!\u201cHmm?!\u201d The big black dog was enjoying its meal when it suddenly paused, as if it felt something, it looked up only to find a sissy staring at its food bowl. Alertness immediately appeared in its eyes.Then, Xiao Xiaolong watched as the big black dog reached out towards the bowl with its paws and pulled it closer to its body. The dog alertly bared its teeth towards Xiao Xiaolong. On its teeth, there were still some pearl-like rice grains.\u201cAm I being looked down upon by a dog\u2026\u201dXiao Xiaolong went into a daze for around two seconds, then flew into a rage.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euDa da da!Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s face turned bright red, and his eyes flashed with anger as he walked back into the shop.Bu Fang glanced at Xiao Xiaolong expressionlessly.\u201cGive me a bowl of Egg-Fried Rice! Hmph! I shall taste it myself. If it doesn\u2019t taste good, I will get the authorities to shut down your restaurant!\u201dXiao Xiaolong threatened with a grimace on his face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It\u2019s because I intend to prove that your Egg-Fried Rice is not worth the price!\u201d\u201cI get it, a bowl of Egg-Fried Rice, right? Wait for it,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly replied. He waved his hand and was heading towards the kitchen, \u201cOh, right. Our Dry-Mixed Noodles and Stir-Fried Vegetables are pretty good as well. Do you want to give them a try?\u201d\u201cIt is said that Egg-Fried Rice tastes better with Stir-Fried Vegetables.\u201d Bu Fang stopped in front of the entrance to the kitchen, looked back, and coolly and shamelessly advertised his other two dishes.Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s mind went into a daze for a moment, then glanced at the prices of the dishes and suddenly felt an inexplicable pain in his chest.\u201cNo need! Just give me the Egg-Fried Rice.\u201d\u201cOh, okay then. That\u2019s just too bad.\u201d Bu Fang nodded and entered the kitchen.Seeing Bu Fang\u2019s calm expression, Xiao Xiaolong was tempted to punch him in the face. He thought, \u201cA hundred gold coins for a plate of Stir-Fried Vegetables, do you really take me for a sucker? To actually charge a hundred gold coins for something that is only worth 10 copper at most, this is probably the only store in the entire continent that would dare to do this.\u201dWhile Bu Fang was preparing the Egg-Fried Rice, Xiao Xiaolong was bored stiff and his gaze naturally shifted towards the big black dog sitting at the entrance, or to be exact, the bowl that it was eating from.In his mind, Xiao Xiaolong recalled the smell of the Egg-Fried Rice. It was like supple silk and like the touch of a lover. All of a sudden, his appetite surged and his stomach rumbled like thunder. Fortunately, there were no other customers in the store, otherwise, young master Xiao who was known in the imperial city for his stylishness and mannerism would be in an embarrassing situation.The big black dog was still eating from its bowl when it suddenly paused, as if it had felt something, and lifted its head. When its eyes landed on Xiao Xiaolong and realized that the foolish human was still staring at its food bowl, it became furious!The dog pulled the bowl closer to itself, stood up and sat down once again with its behind facing Xiao Xiaolong. It only continued to eat after it blocked his line of vision.Xiao Xiaolong felt that his chest was once again pierced by an invisible arrow\u2026 He was looked down upon by the dog a second time!\u201cHmph! Do you think I would desire dog food?! How dare a mere dog look down on a human! Hmph!\u201d Xiao Xiaolong thought angrily.Five minutes had passed and a fragrant smell wafted out from the kitchen once more. The mellow smell of the egg mixed with the faint aroma of the rice was intoxicating Xiao Xiaolong. Just by inhaling the smell, he was uncontrollably salivating.\u201cIt definitely smells good, but it\u2019s still insane to charge a crystal for it!\u201d Xiao Xiaolong thought as he swallowed his saliva.Finally, Bu Fang stepped out of the kitchen with a bowl in hand. The rich fragrance from the dish diffused into the air and enveloped the entire restaurant in it.\u201cHere\u2019s your Egg-Fried Rice, please enjoy your meal.\u201dBu Fang expressionlessly said as he placed the Egg-Fried Rice in front of Xiao Xiaolong.White smoke drifted up from the bowl and rolled into the air in front of Xiao Xiaolong before dispersing. The resulting aroma explosion made Xiao Xiaolong unconsciously suck in a deep breath.Without paying attention to Bu Fang, Xiao Xiaolong stared at the Egg-Fried Rice. He thought, \u201cTo dare to charge a crystal for a bowl of Egg-Fried Rice\u2026 This definitely isn\u2019t an ordinary Egg-Fried Rice!\u201dOn top of the white porcelain bowl were pearl-like rice grains. Every single grain was wrapped in a golden egg liquid. That egg liquid was not completely cooked, and was still in a viscous state. It was as if the rice grains were sprinkled with a layer of egg sauce. However, the viscosity of the egg sauce was perfect and was about eighty percent well-done. When mixed together with the rice grains, it was like draping on a golden gauze dress as it glinted with golden radiance.\u201cIt\u2026 It is shining!\u201d Xiao Xiaolong stared blankly at the bowl of Egg-Fried Rice in front of him.He had never thought that it would be possible for an Egg-Fried Rice to look like a piece of artwork.Xiao Xiaolong was of noble birth. As the third son of a great general, he had access to all kinds of gourmet meals. He had tasted Egg-Fried Rice made by his family\u2019s chef, and even the Egg-Fried Rice made by the imperial chef from the palace\u2026 However, compared to the bowl of shining Egg-Fried Rice in front of him, they lost in both appearance and fragrance.In actual fact, the bowl of Egg-Fried Rice in front of him only contained egg and rice. There were no other ingredients, not even green onions. However, Xiao Xiaolong had an inexplicable feeling that it was definitely much more delicious than the one made by the imperial chef!Xiao Xiaolong picked up the blue-and-white porcelain spoon placed on the table, licked his lips and cut into the Egg-Fried Rice. The moment the spoon scooped into the Egg-Fried Rice, a burst of fragrance rushed out and assaulted his sense of smell. As he carefully scooped up a spoonful of egg and rice, it left behind a string of egg liquid.Without a care in the world, Xiao Xiaolong placed the spoonful of Egg-Fried Rice into his mouth.The moment the spoon entered his mouth, an exquisite taste shocked his taste buds. The viscous egg suddenly solidified and mixed with the soft and pearl-like rice grains to create an explosion in his mouth!\u201cOh my god! How is it possible for such a delicious Egg-Fried Rice to exist in this world?! I actually feel an urge to cry!\u201dXiao Xiaolong was completely engrossed with the taste, it was like his entire being was swimming in a sea made from the taste of the Egg-Fried Rice.Xiao Xiaolong scooped up spoon after spoon of Egg-Fried Rice, even though the heat from the rice was making him sneeze, he was unable to stop.\u201cNom nom!\u201dXiao Xiaolong\u2019s face was almost buried into the bowl as he ate, it was somewhat similar to how the big black dog was when eating the Egg-Fried Rice.\u201cDelicious!\u201d Xiao Xiaolong completed both scooping and eating in a single motion. As he shouted, a few grains of golden rice flew out of his mouth. His eyes widened as he picked up the rice grains from the tabletop and stuffed them into his mouth.Bu Fang sat down opposite of Xiao Xiaolong and calmly watched the scene unfold. Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s way of eating was within his expectations. When he first tried out the Egg-Fried Rice, his appearance was not any better than Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s.Xiao Xiaolong used his tongue to lick the entire bowl clean, going a circle around the bowl\u2019s surface. Only after he swallowed the last grain of rice, he finally breathed out with a satisfied expression on his face.\u201cIs this really Egg-Fried Rice?! It\u2019s incredible! Even my family\u2019s\u2026 No, even the imperial chef wouldn\u2019t be able to make this!\u201d Xiao Xiaolong muttered to himself. Bu Fang remained silent while he coldly sat there.\u201cNow, do you think it\u2019s worth a crystal?\u201d Bu Fang asked.However, Xiao Xiaolong only frowned and smacked his lips. He replied, \u201cIndeed this Egg-Fried Rice is truly a delicacy, but do you even understand the worth of a crystal?\u201cA crystal can help a cultivator when cultivating, but can your Egg-Fried Rice do it? They have completely different values! However, I have to admit that your Egg-Fried Rice is absolutely delicious!\u201dBu Fang raised his eyebrows in surprise. He did not think that Xiao Xiaolong would give a reason like that. Even though it sounded logical, he still thought, \u201cIs this sissy trying to dine and dash?!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euJust when Bu Fang was about to reply, Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s fair-skinned face suddenly turned red. His entire body started to glow, it was like a powerful surge of energy was circulating in his body.\u201cBurp~~\u201dXiao Xiaolong\u2019s face returned to normal after belching, but his expression when looking towards Bu Fang was both weird and passionate.His voice was even trembling\u2026\u201cTell\u2026 Tell me, what ingredients\u2026 are inside of your Egg-Fried Rice?!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His fair-skinned face had flushed red like a beautiful woman\u2019s face, it was tempting enough that others would want to take a bite of him.At any rate, even Bu Fang was charmed. He thought, \u201cOh my god! Why do I have such thoughts?!\u201dBu Fang shook his head furiously to rid himself of the scary thought. He thought to himself, \u201cHe\u2019s a sissy, he\u2019s not a woman!\u201d\u201cI must hold on, I must definitely remain straight!\u201dThus, Bu Fang remained expressionless on his chair, while he looked indifferently at the agitated but enchanting Xiao Xiaolong in front of him.\u201cTell me! This definitely isn\u2019t a normal Egg-Fried Rice! I can feel that the true energy within my body is actually close to reaching a breakthrough!\u201d Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s lips were trembling while his eyes shone.As a famous prodigy in the imperial city and the son of a great general, Xiao Xiaolong was capable with both literary and martial arts. With a cultivation level that reached the peak of second grade Battle-Master, he was considerably strong even among the children of the officials in the imperial city.However, after Xiao Xiaolong ate the Egg-Fried Rice, he felt a sudden jump in the true energy in his body. For over a month, it lay dormant but it suddenly increased just then. That was a sign that his cultivation level was about to advance to third grade Battle-Maniac!To a cultivator, strength was the most important. If a bowl of Egg-Fried Rice could help you attain a breakthrough, then it would be comparable to elixirs\u2026No, it would be even more valuable, because elixirs had no taste. However, the Egg-Fried Rice that Bu Fang made\u2026 was an exquisite cuisine.For it to be both delicious and beneficial to attaining breakthroughs, it was good news to cultivators!A single crystal was too cheap!\u201cExcuse me, I was too agitated. However, I would still like to know the ingredients of your Egg-Fried Rice. If I am not mistaken, the eggs used are not ordinary eggs. Judging from the taste and texture, it should be the egg of a third grade spirit beast, the Thunderstorm Pigeon.\u201dXiao Xiaolong came from a prestigious background and possessed a high amount of self-discipline. He quickly calmed himself down and spoke to Bu Fang.Bu Fang went into a daze. He had never tried to know more about the ingredients before and had always thought that they were ordinary chicken eggs.\u201cSystem, are the eggs really pigeon eggs like the sissy said?\u201d Bu Fang asked the system.The system remained silent for a while, then a solemn voice began to speak.\u201cThe recipe of the ordinary Egg-Fried Rice: The egg chosen is the first egg laid by the third grade spirit beast, Thunderstorm Pigeon, after its gestation. It contains a huge amount of spirit energy. Consumption increases the cultivation level of cultivators and there is a high chance of helping the cultivator to advance past their bottlenecks. The rice chosen is the Pearl Rice from the Southern Wastelands of the Light Wind Empire. It is rich in spirit energy and can only be harvested per annum. It is rich in substances beneficial to cultivation and is currently the royal tribute of the Light Wind Empire. The oil chosen is made from the fats of the Cangshan Boar, it is neither greasy nor muddy. The salt chosen is the Fine Sea Salt from the Southern Wastelands.\u201dBu Fang was expressionless after listening to the system\u2019s explanations and introduction, but he felt as if an invisible arrow had pierced into his chest. He thought, \u201cOuch, it hurts!\u201d\u201cSystem, can we revise the price for the Egg-Fried Rice? I personally feel that we\u2019re making a loss by selling it for only a single crystal. Why don\u2019t we raise the price to ten crystals?\u201d\u201cThe price set by the system is reasonable and fair, it is based on the price of the ingredients. The current rank of the host is too low, the pricing cannot be modified.\u201dBu Fang could only grit his teeth in frustration!The eggs were from a third grade spirit beast. The rice was a royal tribute. The oil was actually made from the fats of a second grade spirit beast. Lastly, even the ordinary looking salt was exceptional as well.\u201cI am making a huge loss by selling this bowl of Egg-Fried Rice for only a crystal!Luckily, all of the ingredients are provided by the system. Otherwise, I would be crying myself to sleep tonight.\u201d\u201cShop owner, my conjecture must be correct! The eggs that you\u2019re using are definitely the eggs of Thunderstorm Pigeons. There was a tingling and numbing sensation as it entered my mouth, they\u2019re definitely pigeon eggs! There\u2019s no way I am wrong!\u201d Xiao Xiaolong got excited once more.Bu Fang was in a bad mood. Looking at the agitated Xiao Xiaolong, he said.\u201cOur store\u2019s Egg-Fried Rice: The egg chosen is the first egg laid by the third grade spirit beast, Thunderstorm Pigeon, after its gestation. It contains a huge amount of spirit energy essence\u2026\u201dBu Fang repeated the system\u2019s introduction\u2014from the beginning to the end\u2014to Xiao Xiaolong.Xiao Xiaolong was completely stunned, his originally large eyes became even larger. He thought, \u201cMy good lord, to think that this bowl of Egg-Fried Rice still held so many secrets! The egg is not ordinary like I thought! The rice is unexpectedly extraordinary! Damn, even the oil is special!And the salt\u2026\u201d Xiao Xiaolong felt that he had actually swallowed a bowl full of gold!\u201cSo, do you still think that a bowl of Egg-Fried Rice isn\u2019t worth one crystal?\u201d Bu Fang grumpily snorted and said.\u201cNo, no, not at all! Shop owner, I would like to order another bowl of Egg-Fried Rice!\u201d Xiao Xiaolong quickly shook his head with a face full of smiles. Eating the bowl of Egg-Fried Rice could increase cultivation level! Even if it were priced at five crystals, Xiao Xiaolong would still think it was worth it!\u201cI am sorry, but our store has a rule where customers can only order each dish once.\u201d Bu Fang arrogantly said while still sitting on the chair.Xiao Xiaolong went into a daze, then he reached into his bosoms and took out a sachet with a peony sewn on it. The corner of Bu Fang\u2019s mouth twitched when he saw the peony sachet. If it was not for the fact that Xiao Xiaolong had an adam\u2019s apple and no breasts, Bu Fang would definitely think that he was a girl in disguise!\u201cHere! Shop owner, I have five pieces of crystals here. Give me another bowl!\u201d Xiao Xiaolong excitedly placed the sparkling crystals on the table, and implored Bu Fang in a whiny tone.Bu Fang completely ignored Xiao Xiaolong and kept the crystal with the best quality that he picked out. He expressionlessly said, \u201cIf a male customer continues to act in a feminine manner towards the shop owner, he shall be inexorably added to our store\u2019s blacklist and shall never be served again.\u201dXiao Xiaolong knew he would not be able to eat a second bowl of Egg-Fried Rice on that day, so he stood up and left.As Xiao Xiaolong was walking past the entrance, he paused and glanced at the empty bowl in front of the big black dog. He felt as if an invisible arrow had pierced into his chest.\u201cSuch a valuable bowl of Egg-Fried Rice was actually fed to a dog! What a waste! Hmph!\u201dThe big black dog was a lot lazier after it finished its meal, it licked its own claws as it lay on the floor. As Xiao Xiaolong walked past the dog, it lazily glanced at him and then took no further notice.Xiao Xiaolong decided to turn a blind eye and left the unique little restaurant in the isolated alleyway.After Bu Fang stood up and collected the bowl in front of Blacky, he closed up the entrance and the business ended for that day.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOnce Bu Fang placed the dishes into the dishwasher provided by the system, he had completed everything. He returned to his room expectantly.\u201cMy host, congratulations for completing your first system mission and receiving the system reward. My host, congratulations for obtaining your first customer and taking the first step onto the road to become the God of Cooking.\u201dBu Fang excitedly sat on the chair in his room, the solemn voice of the system sounded out in his mind.\u201cHehe! It\u2019s finally here! What kind of a reward will it be, I am so excited!\u201dBu Fang\u2019s eyes shone faintly as he rubbed his hands in excitement. The calm exterior that he displayed earlier on had completely disappeared.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What\u2019s so different about the improved Egg-Fried Rice?\u201d Bu Fang was disappointed. He thought that he would unlock newer dishes, but it was still Egg-Fried Rice. Even if it was the improved version\u2026 it was still just Egg-Fried Rice!\u201cThe improved version of Egg-Fried Rice has a higher grade than ordinary Egg-Fried Rice and uses different ingredients. Cultivators below the level of third grade Battle-Maniac are not allowed to order this dish.\u201dThe system solemnly explained the difference between the improved version and the ordinary version. Bu Fang was slightly surprised but did not think much of it. After all, since it was the improved version, it must be somehow better.\u201cThen, what is the fragment of the God of Cooking set?\u201d\u201cFragments of the God of Cooking set: By collecting all the fragments, the host can exchange them for the God of Cooking set. The kitchen tools that the host is currently using are only ordinary tools.\u201d\u201cThis God of Cooking set sounds like something amazing!\u201d Bu Fang blinked in surprise, then a smile appeared on his previously expressionless face.A new dish mysteriously appeared on the menu of the little restaurant, and there was a price next to it as well.Improved version of Egg-Fried Rice, ten crystals.\u201cAs a young man aiming to become the God of Cooking, how could you not have any short-term goals? System mission: please make a profit of at least a hundred crystals and a thousand gold coins within a week.\u201dThe system solemnly assigned a mission to Bu Fang.In order to make a profit of a hundred crystals within a week, he would need to sell a hundred bowls of ordinary Egg-Fried Rice or ten bowls of the improved version. And in order to make a profit of a thousand gold coins, he would need to sell ten portions of Stir-Fried Vegetables or Dry-Mixed Noodles\u2026\u201cSystem, this is too difficult! I only managed to sell a bowl of Egg-Fried Rice today, and you actually want me to sell a hundred bowls of ordinary Egg-Fried Rice within seven days\u2026 Why don\u2019t you just kill me instead!?\u201d Bu Fang sorrowfully complained to the system.However, the system solemnly encouraged Bu Fang instead. \u201cIn order to become the God of Cooking, you must not be afraid of any difficult. All of the difficulties that you will encounter are just stepping stones for you to become the greatest!\u201dHowever, Bu Fang remained expressionless. He was indifferent to the system\u2019s encouragement. Maybe if the system was not using such a solemn tone, Bu Fang might have been duped.With a sigh, Bu Fang lay down on his bed and closed his eyes.\u2026\u2026Xiao Xiaolong was back home at the general\u2019s manor, but he seemed a little distracted. The fact that the true energy in his body was still in a stimulated state made everything feel unreal.\u201cTo be able to advance past a bottleneck just by eating a bowl of Egg-Fried Rice, this\u2026 This is unbelievable.\u201d As Xiao Xiaolong recalled the taste of the Egg-Fried Rice, he became enraptured as he imagined himself floating in a sea of fragrance.The general\u2019s manor was huge, Xiao Xiaolong walked past a lot of servants along the way. When the maidservants saw his appearance, they covered their mouth in surprise.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with young master Xiao?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s with the creepy expression on his face!\u201d\u201cBleh! That\u2019s too scary! My perfect image of young master Xiao has been completely destroyed, he was my first love!\u201d\u2026\u2026The conversation between the servants woke Xiao Xiaolong up. When he noticed the servants were gawking at him, he quickened his pace and disappeared from their field of vision.Xiao Xiaolong was sitting cross-legged in a simple room with his eyes closed. The true energy was circulating in his body and his skin was shimmering, causing him to appear holy.A burst of energy rushed out of Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s energy core into his limbs and acupuncture points. The true energy was gentle like a flowing river that nourishes everything it touches, it was like a gentle kneading by a woman\u2019s hands.After approximately fifteen minutes, Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s face reddened and his eyes suddenly opened. As the energy emanating from his body steadily increased, his eyes shone and he opened his mouth to expel a lump of turbid energy.When it reached an extreme point, it suddenly completely retreated into his body like it never existed in the first place.As Xiao Xiaolong stood up, the sound of colliding bones resounded all over his body. He lifted up his hand and a dense sphere of true energy appeared in the middle of his palm.\u201cHaha! Manifestation of true energy! I\u2019ve truly become a third grade Battle-Maniac!\u201dXiao Xiaolong laughed out loud in delight.\u201cZhao Ruge! Now, I am a third grade Battle-Maniac as well! I am no longer afraid of you!\u201d Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s mouth widened and he started giggling.However, before he finished laughing, the door to his room was pushed open. The true energy that he used to lock his door was dispersed by an even stronger burst of true energy.\u201cXiao Xiaolong! You must be quite capable now, how dare you use your elder sister as a wager in your gamble with Zhao Ruge!\u201dAs the door burst open, a beautiful voice sounded out and a graceful figure stepped into the room.\u201cEh? Ah\u2026 Elder sister!\u201dWhen Xiao Xiaolong saw the intruder, his entire body shivered and he called out in surprise.The intruder was a beautiful female with fair skin and bright eyes. She was dressed in snow-white robes with an aqua-green transparent vest. Her silk-like hair was let down and allowed to hang free behind her.Xiao Yanyu knitted her eyebrows and she sullenly looked at Xiao Xiaolong. She was angry that her self-styled casanova younger brother actually dared to use her as a wager.\u201cElder sister, hear me out first. It\u2019s because I fell for the trap set by that damn brat, Zhao Ruge! Don\u2019t worry, I will definitely win the gamble! Look, I am already a third grade Battle-Maniac!\u201dXiao Xiaolong quickly said as he held out his hand and a sphere of true energy appeared.Even though Xiao Yanyu was angry, she was still surprised. She was well aware of her younger brother\u2019s abilities, he had been stuck at the peak of second grade Battle-Master for quite a while. There was not even a slightest sign of a breakthrough on the previous day, so how did he suddenly succeed?\u201cElder sister! Zhao Ruge may be a third grade Battle-Maniac as well, but you should believe in your younger brother! I will definitely beat the daylights out of him!\u201d Xiao Xiaolong said with a laugh.Xiao Yanyu was a well-known beauty within the imperial city. Zhao Ruge has coveted her beauty for quite some time. However, since she was the daugher of the Great General Xiao Meng, Zhao Ruge did not dare to do anything, even though he was the son of the Minister of the Left.If Xiao Yanyu was the daughter of a commoner, she would most likely be Zhao Ruge\u2019s concubine by now.\u201cElder sister, aren\u2019t you curious about how I managed to advance?\u201d Xiao Xiaolong said temptingly.Xiao Yanyu slightly lifted up her skirt and sat down on a stool. Her bright eyes glanced at Xiao Xiaolong and she said, \u201cSay it, I am listening.\u201dXiao Xiaolong grinned, he knew that his elder sister would notice the abnormality of his breakthrough.Xiao Yanyu was extremely intelligent and was known as the number one female prodigy in the Light Wind Empire. He was almost certain that she would notice it.And so, Xiao Xiaolong secretively leaned over to Xiao Yanyu\u2019s ear in an extremely serious manner.Xiao Yanyu trembled in surprise. She thought, \u201cIt looks like this secret might really be something. For my usually frivolous younger brother to be this serious about it, it seems that I should really pay close attention to this.\u201d\u201cElder sister! The secret to my breakthrough\u2026 is actually because of\u2026 a bowl of Egg-Fried Rice!\u201d\u201cSo it\u2019s because of Egg-Fried Rice! Eh?! Huh? Egg-Fried Rice?!\u201dXiao Yanyu\u2019s beautiful face froze, then turned bright red. This brat, how dare he make fun of his elder sister!Immediately, Xiao Yanyu\u2019s white and long fingers were twisting Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s ear. She coldly laughed and said, \u201cI see, so you\u2019ve grown enough to make fun of your elder sister! So Egg-Fried Rice is an elixir? So it even helps you to advance? What a load of nonsense!\u201dXiao Xiaolong felt as if an invisible arrow had pierced into his chest. \u201cI am telling the truth! Where has the trust between siblings gone to?\u201dXiao Xiaolong could only recount his encounter with a grimace on his face, in his description the little restaurant in the alley was an enigmatic place.\u201cSo, you\u2019re telling me that you spent a crystal just to eat a bowl of Egg-Fried Rice?!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euXiao Yanyu glared at her younger brother who had a triumphant expression on his face, she suddenly had a desire to tear off the ear of this wastrel.\u201cElder sister! If you don\u2019t believe me, I will bring you to the little restaurant tomorrow. You will definitely be pleased. That taste of the Egg-Fried Rice, that smell\u2026 Ohh, it\u2019s as if my childhood memories were evoked.\u201dXiao Xiaolong\u2019s eyes were filled with fascination.However, Xiao Yanyu was in disbelief. She thought, \u201cThis brat is definitely under some weird spell. It\u2019s just a bowl of Egg-Fried Rice, how delicious could it be.Hmph! We shall see tomorrow, the true face of this mysterious Egg-Fried Rice!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The manor was situated in an urban area, it was noisy the moment they stepped out.Even though it was noisy outside, it was peaceful and quiet inside the general\u2019s manor. It\u2019s all because of the noise-prevention magic formation that was drawn by the architects when the manor was being built.Xiao Yanyu rarely left the manor as she knew how attractive her appearance was to men. There was one time when she did not wear a veil when she went out, that one incident caused a traffic jam in the imperial city and there were even fighting incidents between playboys. Ever since that incident, Xiao Yanyu rarely left her house. Even if she did, she would wear a veil.As the Xiao siblings left the manor and turned a corner, they entered a busy street. There were hawkers and their stalls on both sides of the streets, and the smell of deep fried food was drifting in the air.Cultivators like Xiao Xiaolong and Xian Yanyu would never eat fried food from stalls like this as the oil they used were often of poor quality, and thus contained toxins. The main goal of cultivators was to cleanse their bodies and to get rid of the impurities in them. Eating these types of food would only increase the impurities in their bodies.That was why cultivators were fussy about their diets, and were especially concerned with the quality of the food.Strictly speaking, Egg-Fried Rice would be considered junk food as well. However, if Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s breakthrough was because of a bowl of Egg-Fried Rice, and if it was not a coincidence, then there must be something wrong with the Egg-Fried Rice.And it was unlikely to be a coincidence, since Xiao Xiaolong had been stuck as a second grade Battle-Master for a long time. To the point where it was impossible to be a coincidence. It was far more probable that the Egg-Fried Rice had something to do with his breakthrough.That was what Xiao Yanyu was curious about, could a bowl of Egg-Fried Rice really be that miraculous?\u201cOh my! If that isn\u2019t our young master Xiao? Where are you planning to recite poetry today?\u201dJust when the Xiao siblings were deep in their thoughts, a jarring voice interrupted them.Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s beautiful face darkened and he turned towards the frivolous man at a distance. It was an ugly-looking man in colorful long robes, carrying a paper fan.That person was the only son of the empire\u2019s Finance Minister\u2026 Sun Qixiang!He was infamously known as a playboy within the imperial city.\u201cSun Qixiang! I have no time for you today, get out of my way!\u201d Even though Xiao Xiaolong looked like a sissy, he was quite capable of giving off a powerful aura when angry.However, Sun Qixiang was not afraid of him. He shrugged his shoulders while he impudently stared at the veil-wearing women next to Xiao Xiaolong. Suddenly, his eyes widened in surprise!\u201cOh my! I can\u2019t believe it! It\u2019s actually Miss Yanyu! It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you.\u201dSun Qixiang had realized the identity of Xiao Yanyu and immediately lost his composure. As a playboy, he would not miss the chance to harass his dream goddess.\u201cGet out of the way,\u201d Xiao Yanyu said faintly, she did not want to waste any words with him.Sun Qixiang shrugged his shoulders. He wanted to strike up a conversation but his blood quickly turned cold when he met Xiao Yanyu\u2019s eyes. He was quickly reminded of Xiao Yanyu\u2019s terrifying strength.After tens of thousands of years of development, the cultivation system on Qianlong Continent had a strict grading system.On Qianlong Continent, every person was a cultivator. From an elderly person to a five-year-old child, cultivation was present in every household. However, with the differences in talents, the level of results were different as well.There were nine different grades: first grade Warrior, second grade Battle-Master, third grade Battle-Maniac, fourth grade Battle-Spirit, fifth grade Battle-King, sixth grade Battle-Emperor, seventh grade Battle-Saint, eighth grade War-God, ninth grade Supreme-Being.There was also a tenth grade as well, but that was not something an ordinary person would know.Known as a female prodigy in the imperial city, Xiao Yanyu was a cultivation genius. Even though she was not even eighteen years old, she was already a fourth grade Battle-Spirit. Compared to her younger brother, Xiao Xiaolong, she was far more powerful.Even the Great General Xiao Meng, had often exclaimed that it would have been great if Xiao Yanyu were a male.Sun Qixiang was only a playboy. Even though he was in his twenties, he was only a third grade Battle-Maniac. But since he was a third grade Battle-Maniac after all, he was not afraid of Xiao Xiaolong. However, when faced with the fourth grade Battle-Spirit Xiao Yanyu, it was a whole different matter.Xiao Xiaolong coldly snorted and followed after Xiao Yanyu, who had already left. The two of them quickly disappeared within the crowd.Sun Qixiang scratched his cheeks and his eyes narrowed. He turned to one of his underling and whispered something to him. The underling quickly ran off while Sun Qixiang followed after the Xiao siblings with a sinister smile.\u2026After sleeping until he woke up naturally, the depressed Bu Fang took his time with opening up the restaurant.The big black dog was still lying at the entrance. It glanced up at Bu Fang when he opened up the entrance, then it went back to sleep.\u201cWithin the next seven days, I need to sell a hundred portions of Egg-Fried Rice and ten portions of Stir-Fried Vegetables or Dry-Mixed Noodles\u2026 System, do you really think that it\u2019s possible for a small restaurant in such a deserted place to achieve such miraculous results?\u201d Bu Fang placed a chair by the entrance and curled himself up on it. In his mind, he was arguing with the system.\u201cYoung man! You are someone aiming to become the God of Cooking, you must have faith in your cooking! You must believe you can conquer the world!\u201d The system solemnly encouraged Bu Fang once more.Bu Fang rolled his eyes. He thought, \u201cI rather comfortably get a sunbath than conquer the world.\u201dBu Fang was feeling sleepy again as he lay in the sun, even though he had just woken up.\u201cShop owner! I am here again! I am already in love with your Egg-Fried Rice!\u201dBu Fang\u2019s eyes were only closed for a moment when a shout woke him up. He expressionlessly looked up and saw the sissy who ate Egg-Fried Rice the day before.\u201cHuh?\u201d There was someone next to him, even though she was wearing a veil, Bu Fang immediately knew she was a woman! \u201cWhat a nice chest and ass\u2026 She has a great figure!\u201dXiao Yanyu knitted her eyebrows as she appraised the little restaurant that Xiao Xiaolong brought her to. She thought, \u201cCan such a remote restaurant really make that miraculous Egg-Fried Rice?\u201d\u201cAre you the owner of this restaurant?\u201d Xiao Yanyu asked.Her voice was beautiful, it was pleasing to the ear.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Bu Fang calmly nodded.Xiao Yanyu entered the store without saying anything further. The interior was very clean. When she ran her finger over a table, there was not even a speck of dust. She was also quite pleased with the store\u2019s ambience.Even though the store was small and in a remote location, the decorations were well done, the ambience was good and the place was clean.After Xiao Yanyu finished her appraisal of her surroundings, her eyes landed on the menu in the middle of the store. Immediately, she raised her eyebrows and her eyes flashed with incredulity.\u201cSo what Xiaolong said was true about a bowl of Egg-Fried Rice\u2026 costing a crystal, eh? The improved version of Egg-Fried Rice actually costs ten crystals?! Is this guy an idiot?\u201d\u201cShop owner, I don\u2019t think I saw this improved Egg-Fried Rice yesterday? Why is it suddenly here today?\u201d Xiao Xiaolong was also surprised with the appearance of the new Egg-Fried Rice that was being sold for ten crystals.\u201cOh, I forgot to write it yesterday. However, keep in mind that you need to be a third grade Battle-Maniac to order this dish. Otherwise, you are not qualified,\u201d Bu Fang yawned and expressionlessly replied.\u201cThere\u2019s even a requirement in order to eat it?\u201d Xiao Yanyu immediately became interested, she was suddenly very curious about this improved Egg-Fried Rice.\u201cXiaolong, how many crystals did you bring?\u201d Xiao Yanyu turned towards Xiao Xiaolong and asked.Xiao Xiaolong dazedly replied, \u201cTen crystals.\u201d\u201cHmm, very good.\u201d Xiao Yanyu nodded contentedly. She waved her hand and a sachet with a peony sewn on it appeared in her hand.\u201cShop owner, give me a bowl of improved Egg-Fried Rice,\u201d Xiao Yanyu calmly said.\u201cAlright, please wait.\u201d When Xiao Yanyu actually ordered the improved Egg-Fried Rice, Bu Fang was delighted but did not let it show on his face. He wanted to maintain a cool attitude of a chef in front of a beautiful woman.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euXiao Xiaolong\u2019s face had already turned pale from anguish and was grudgingly looking at Xiao Yanyu.Bu Fang turned around and was about to enter the kitchen when suddenly, a tsk-tsk sound coming from the entrance made him stop.\u201cTsk, tsk, tsk! For the number one female prodigy in the Light Wind Empire to actually come to such a pathetic little restaurant to eat a bowl of Egg-Fried Rice? Oh my, how funny is that!\u201dSun Qixiang shrugged his shoulders and shook his head as he entered the little store.\u201cMiss Yanyu, do you like eating Egg-Fried Rice? Okay! I will treat you!

However, in Bu Fang\u2019s store, Bu Fang was not happy about it.Bu Fang was going to enter the kitchen but he stopped. He turned around, looked towards Sun Qixiang who was in a colorful robes and solemnly said, \u201cSir, our store only sells a portion of Egg-Fried Rice to each customer per day. You can order Stir-Fried Vegetables or Dry-Mixed Noodles\u2026 Oh, you can order the improved version of Egg-Fried Rice as well.\u201dSun Qixiang was surprised, he did not think that he would be rejected. He looked towards Bu Fang as if he was staring at an idiot, and while pointing his paper fan towards him he said with a grin, \u201cDo you not know who I am?\u201dHe was one of the three famous playboys in the imperial city, Sun Qixiang. There was not anyone who did not know him! For an owner of a little restaurant to reject him, he was seeking death!Bu Fang knitted his eyebrows and carefully looked at Sun Qixiang. He had slender eyes, pouty lips and monkey-like cheeks. Even though he was ugly to the point where he could be mistaken for someone from a different species\u2026 Bu Fang truly did not recognise him.\u201cI don\u2019t recognise you. However, these are the rules of our store, you can leave if you\u2019re not eating,\u201d Bu Fang simply said.\u201cOh my! How interesting, I enjoy breaking the rules the most! If you don\u2019t give me ten bowls of Egg-Fried Rice, I will smash your store up! How dare a tiny little store like this talk about rules with me!\u201d Sun Qixiang laughed. He thought it was interesting that someone in the imperial city actually did not know him.Xiao Yanyu could no longer stand by and do nothing. She did not think that Sun Qixiang would actually follow them to this store. If the store was destroyed, the blame would be on her.\u201cSun Qixiang, you\u2019d better watch it! If you\u2019re here to eat, then eat properly. Do you really want me to throw you out?!\u201d There was a slight coldness in Xiao Yanyu\u2019s voice.Xiao Xiaolong was already staring coldly at Sun Qixiang.Bu Fang remained expressionless after hearing Sun Qixiang\u2019s threat.He rubbed his palms together and faintly glanced at Sun Qixiang, he said, \u201cSmash my store up? I don\u2019t think you\u2019re capable of that. If you\u2019re ordering something, then hurry up. The menu is on the wall. If you continue to waste my time, I am permanently blacklisting you.\u201dXiao Yanyu went into a daze, even Xiao Xiaolong was stunned. They could not understand the reason why Bu Fang was not afraid of Sun Qixiang. Sun Qixiang had a lot of power within the imperial city, even the number one restaurant, Immortal Phoenix Restaurant, would not dare to offend him. What emboldened Bu Fang to go against him?Sun Qixiang angrily smiled. For a tiny little restaurant owner like that to be so arrogant in front of him, he learnt something new that day.\u201cBrat, you have guts. The last person who spoke to me this way became fish food.\u201d Sun Qixiang coldly smiled and looked towards the menu. On the menu, there were four dishes.He could have immediately ordered his men to smash the store up, but not with Xiao Yanyu around. Since that was the case, he wanted to see what this little store was capable of.\u201cHaha, this truly is a small restaurant. With only four dishes, one of them is repeated as well\u2026 Are you telling me you can cook up a feast with Egg-Fried Rice?\u201d Sun Qixiang only looked at the name of the dishes and completely ignored the prices.Price? Sun Qixiang had more than enough money!\u201cWhat are you ordering?\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly asked.\u201cGive me every single dish on the menu.\u201d Sun Qixiang sat down at a table. He wanted to know what exactly the little restaurant had that could attract the number one beauty in the imperial city.Sun Qixiang appraised the little restaurant. He had to admit that the decoration was quite unique, it felt cozy.\u201cEvery single dish? Alright, that\u2019s eleven crystals and two hundred gold coins in total.\u201dBu Fang smirked and indifferently reported the price.Sun Qixiang was sitting on a chair with his leg crossed over his knee. When he heard the price that Bu Fang reported, his expression froze and he looked at Bu Fang as if he was an idiot.\u201cDo you think I am stupid? It\u2019s just two bowls of Egg-Fried Rice, a plate of Stir-Fried Vegetables and a plate of Dry-Mixed Noodles, and you\u2019re telling me that it\u2019s eleven crystals and two hundred gold coins? If you\u2019re looking to rip someone off, at least choose your victims well, how dare you try to scam me?!\u201dSun Qixiang practically shouted those words out. Even though he was well-to-do, he was not a brainless idiot.\u201cAre you blind? The price is written on the menu, get lost if you\u2019re not ordering!\u201d Bu Fang\u2019s patience had already completely disappeared, he did not have much leniency towards customers. As someone who aimed to become the God of Cooking, he had his own pride.\u201cDon\u2019t pretend to be rich if you have no money.\u201dWhen Xiao Xiaolong saw Sun Qixiang\u2019s reaction, he almost laughed out loud. He had the same expression as Sun Qixiang when he first saw the prices of the dishes. Now that he saw the same expression on other people, he felt an inexplicable kind of pleasure.\u201cNo money? What a joke! I can smash you to death just by using money! Cut the crap! Serve the dishes first! I will definitely pay!\u201d Sun Qixiang glanced at Xiao Xiaolong disdainfully, opened his paper fan and waved it while he said.His eyes were rotating as if something was on his mind.Bu Fang did not mind. Since Sun Qixiang had already ordered, he would just go ahead and cook the dish. Anyone who entered the store was a customer, he was not afraid that they would create trouble. That was because the store was modified by the system, any attempts to create trouble would only end badly.\u201cPlease wait a moment.\u201dWithout saying anything further, Bu Fang entered the kitchen.\u201cYanyu, why would a beautiful woman like you come to such a place to eat some stupid Egg-Fried Rice!\u201d While they waited for their dishes to arrive, Sun Qixiang was bored. He turned towards the dignified Xiao Yanyu who was sitting nearby and tried to strike up a conversation.However, Xiao Yanyu sat there like a statue and simply ignored him.Sun Qixiang was given the cold shoulder by Xiao Yanyu but he didn\u2019t think much of it. He was used to it when harassing beautiful women. And so, he continued to appraise the store with eyes filled with aversion.When Sun Qixiang saw the prices on the menu once more, his eyes flashed with ridicule.Xiao Xiaolong sat on one side in low spirits while he grudgingly looked at Xiao Yanyu. All of his crystals were taken away by his bully of a sister and he only had gold coins on him, so he could only order a portion of Dry-Mixed Noodles.It may not be Egg-Fried Rice, but since it was from the same store, it should be extraordinary as well. After all\u2026 It was being sold for a hundred gold coins.Everyone within the small store held their own thoughts.Suddenly, a burst of fragrance drifted out from the kitchen, it was like a floating piece of silk as it caressed their faces.Xiao Xiaolong was engrossed in the smell. \u201cOh! It\u2019s this smell, this intoxicating and nostalgic smell!\u201dXiao Yanyu\u2019s bright eyes were filled with surprise as well. \u201cIt\u2019s truly\u2026 fragrant!\u201dSun Qixiang sniffed and his eyes suddenly lit up. \u201cIt looks like this little store has some capabilities after all! This fragrance is\u2026 wonderful!\u201dWith three pairs of eyes staring at him, Bu Fang leisurely walked out of the kitchen.\u201cHere\u2019s your improved Egg-Fried Rice, enjoy your meal.\u201d Bu Fang was holding a blue and water porcelain bowl in his hand, rich fragrance was drifting up from the bowl while forming a mist above it, that obscured the view of the dish.When the blue and white porcelain bowl was placed in front of Xiao Yanyu, the rich fragrance immediately rushed towards her, like an aromatic bomb had exploded.The smell immediately flowed into Xiao Yanyu\u2019s nostrils like a river meeting the sea. The light breeze lifted up her pink veil and exposed her beautiful face.Gururu.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euXiao Yanyu gulped and a small rumble came from her stomach. Her beautiful face flushed red in embarrassment.For a bowl of Egg-Fried Rice to cause a fourth grade Battle-Spirit to feel hunger\u2026 It was a miracle!When the mist obscuring the dish finally dissipated, a burst of golden rays suddenly emerged from the bowl.Sun Qixiang and Xiao Xiaolong were shocked!Even Xiao Yanyu covered her mouth and gasped in surprise.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When Xiao Xiaolong told her about it, she did not believe him. Now that she had seen it, it still felt unreal.Rich fragrance continuously rushed into Xiao Yanyu\u2019s nasal cavity, that smell was like a lover\u2019s caress causing her entire body to relax. Her mind was completely empty of distractions, there was only one thing in her mind: Eat it!Xiao Yanyu was still a goddess of Light Wind Empire after all, she needed to maintain her image even if she was in front of gourmet food. She gently lifted up her veil and exposed her rosy and ample lips.Using the blue and white porcelain spoon to scoop up a spoonful of Egg-Fried Rice; the egg fluid, which was not fully cooked, stretched as the spoon was lifted up. It was like a shining golden thread. Warm air rose from the blue and white porcelain spoon and a rich fragrance accompanied it.Xiao Yanyu\u2019s skin, that was as fair as beancurd, turned red from the warm air.\u201cElder sister, how is the taste of this improved Egg-Fried Rice?!\u201d As Xiao Xiaolong breathed in the smell of the Egg-Fried Rice, he could not help but ask as he watched the spoon enter his sister\u2019s mouth.The blue and white porcelain spoon lightly brushed against Xiao Yanyu\u2019s teeth and every single rice grain fell into her mouth. Xiao Yanyu narrowed her eyes as a burst of flavour rushed straight into her brain, as if a flavour bomb had exploded in her mouth.Her taste buds were completely enveloped and conquered by the Egg-Fried Rice.\u201cOh\u2026 It\u2019s\u2026 delicious!\u201dXiao Yanyu gave an euphoric expression and she moaned. After that, she completely ignored the others and started to stuff spoon after spoon of Egg-Fried Rice into her mouth. Her image was completely destroyed within seconds.She had never eaten an Egg-Fried Rice that tasted so good. As a fourth-grade Battle-Spirit, she almost did not need to consume food. For someone like her to have their appetite stimulated by a bowl of Egg-Fried Rice, it was almost unbelievable. As Xiao Xiaolong had said, it was a miraculous bowl of Egg-Fried Rice!Gururu!When Xiao Xiaolong saw Xiao Yanyu devouring her food without caring about her image, he did not laugh at her. He was looking at her enviously instead, there was even a rumbling sound coming from his stomach.Sun Qixiang was speechless as he watched his dream goddess devouring her food, he could not understand her actions at all.\u201cIt\u2019s just a bowl of Egg-Fried Rice\u2026 Is there a need to be so desperate?!Even though this bowl of Egg-Fried Rice smells\u2026 really good, you\u2019re still a goddess. There\u2019s no need for you to throw away your image for a bowl of Egg-Fried Rice!\u201d\u201cShop owner! Where is my Egg-Fried Rice! Hurry up and serve it! Hurry!\u201dEven though Sun Qixiang was thinking that, he was even more curious about the Egg-Fried Rice. He closed the paper fan in his hand and glanced sideways. He shouted at Bu Fang who seemed to be smiling while watching Xiao Yanyu eat.Bu Fang raised his eyebrows and indifferently glanced at Sun Qixiang. He did not say anything, but instead turned around and entered the kitchen.\u201cHurry up! If I am not eating your Egg-Fried Rice by the time three minutes have passed, I will smash up this tiny little store!\u201d Sun Qixiang arrogantly said.Bu Fang expressionlessly entered the kitchen and took out a bag of flour from the refrigerator.Was he going to cook Egg-Fried Rice? Wrong\u2026 Sun Qixiang actually dared to threaten him, a chef. Since that was the case, then he would have to go on an empty stomach for a while. He would understand soon enough, the fate of someone who offends a chef, especially a petty minded one.Dry-Mixed Noodles was actually a simple dish. It was just pulled noodles mixed with seasoning.However, the Dry-Mixed Noodles that Bu Fang used was handmade. With a special kneading technique used to create the noodles, the taste was definitely extraordinary.As Bu Fang had already practiced this countless times, making a bowl of Dry-Mixed Noodles from dough would only need around ten minutes. His kneading skills were pleasing to the eyes, it was like his hands had disappeared and afterimages were kneading the dough.After the kneading was done, he had to pull the noodles apart using moderate strength. Then he sprinkled some flour on the thin noodles and soaked them in hot water once.The water used to cook the noodles was not ordinary either. It was clear and translucent and did not contain any impurities. The steam coming from it even had a little sweet smell in it.While the noodles were being soaked, Bu Fang was preparing the seasoning. He placed a strict proportion of salt, soy sauce and monosodium glutamate into a blue and white porcelain bowl and poured a little hot water in it. Then he removed the noodles from the hot water and poured them into the bowl. Using bamboo chopsticks, he stirred the bowl which caused the color of the soy sauce to completely seep into the crystal clear noodles.A bowl of steaming Dry-Mixed Noodles was complete.There was no soup, egg or vegetables. It was purely a bowl of Dry-Mixed Noodles.Bu Fang carried the bowl of Dry-Mixed Noodles out of the kitchen. The fragrance was not as strong as when he carried out the Egg-Fried Rice, but the color of the Dry-Mixed Noodles was appealing.When Sun Qixiang saw Bu Fang walking out of the kitchen with a blue and white porcelain bowl, he thought his Egg-Fried Rice was here and excitedly went up to receive it.\u201cThis is the sissy\u2019s Dry-Mixed Noodles,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly moved aside and simply said.Sun Qixiang\u2019s expression froze and he angrily stared at Bu Fang with narrowed eyes. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you to cook Egg-Fried Rice?! Who told you to cook Dry-Mixed Noodles! Do you want me to close down this business?!\u201dBu Fang completely ignored Sun Qixiang, he set down the Dry-Mixed Noodles in front of Xiao Xiaolong and calmly said, \u201cHere\u2019s your Dry-Mixed Noodles, enjoy your meal.\u201dXiao Xiaolong\u2019s eyes lit up. He was ravenous after being enticed by the Egg-Fried Rice, the smell was simply too tantalizing. He even overlooked the fact that Bu Fang called him a sissy.Even though the Dry-Mixed Noodles was not the Egg-Fried Rice, it was better than having nothing to eat! Although the smell was not as rich as the other dish, there was still a burst of fragrance circulating within the nasal cavities if you breathed in deeply.How could a bowl of Dry-Mixed Noodles being sold for a hundred gold coins be ordinary!Xiao Xiaolong picked up a strand of noodle with his chopsticks and impatiently sucked it into his mouth.Slurp!Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s eyes widened in surprise. The noodle immediately slid into his mouth as if it had come alive. As the springiness was ample, it even bounced around his mouth after he bit it off. The feeling as it bounced around gave him an unusual enjoyment, it felt as if multiple tiny hands were lightly scratching his mouth.Oh\u2026With his mouth stuffed with noodles, Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s eyes narrowed into a slit. He shook his head with a face full of enjoyment.Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s expression was reflected in Sun Qixiang\u2019s eyes. He could no longer suppress his curiosity, he could not wait any further.\u201cHurry up and get back into the kitchen! I want to immediately taste the Egg-Fried Rice and Dry-Mixed Noodles!\u201dSun Qixiang coldly stared at Bu Fang.\u201cYou seemed to have forgotten who you\u2019re speaking to? Also, stop rushing me. If I hear another word, I am blacklisting you.\u201dBu Fang\u2019s eyebrows knitted together, he was getting more dissatisfied. He thought, \u201cThis guy is looking for trouble.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re very cocky, I may just tear down your store!\u201d Sun Qixiang said threateningly, while poking Bu Fang\u2019s chest with his paper fan.Bu Fang responded with a smile. Since he seldom smiled, his smile looked stiff.He did not say anything further and returned to the kitchen.After approximately thirty minutes, Bu Fang leisurely came back.Xiao Xiaolong and Xiao Yanyu had already finished their meals, but they did not leave. They still had to pay their bills, and more importantly, to take a look at the Stir-Fried Vegetables.They had already witnessed Egg-Fried Rice and Dry-Mixed Noodles, there was only Stir-Fried Vegetables to go.Based on the standards of the other dishes, Stir-Fried Vegetables would surely be out of the ordinary as well.When the famished Sun Qixiang finally saw his food being carried out of the kitchen, he was so excited that he quickly came forward and snatched the tray away from Bu Fang.There were four dishes on the tray. There were two bowls of Egg-Fried Rice that were so fragrant that the smell enveloped the entire restaurant. There was also another bowl of Dry-Mixed Noodles with an enticing color, and also\u2026 A fresh piece of\u2026 leaf?!Since Sun Qixiang ordered all of the dishes, Bu Fang cooked all of them at once.It seemed that the piece of leaf might be the legendary\u2026 Stir-Fried Vegetables.\u201cAre you an idiot? Why didn\u2019t you serve me dish by dish? Are you deliberately trying to starve me?!\u201d Sun Qixiang transfixedly breathed in the smell of the Egg-Fried Rice, then turned towards Bu Fang and scolded him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBu Fang could not be bothered to answer him. What was Sun Qixiang expecting after offending a chef? He should be thankful that he did not have to wait an additional hour or two.So, why would Bu Fang serve the dishes on time? It was not because he was afraid of Sun Qixiang. There was a reason for it\u2026\u201cSystem, are you sure that thing you gave me will work?\u201d\u201c[Abyssal Chilli Sauce], the chilli used is selectively chosen from the extremely spicy Facing Heaven Pepper that grows in the abyss. It is extremely intense after experiencing the daily essence energy respiration of the abyssal devils. A single drop will cause a person to feel as if their entire body is on fire. A spoonful will cause a person to experience hallucinations. A jar is deadly.\u201dThe system solemnly explained the chilli sauce that Bu Fang added into the Egg-Fried Rice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even though his ambition was to become the God of Cooking, it did not change the fact that he was just an ordinary person from Earth.\u201cPlease enjoy your meal,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly said to Sun Qixiang, who was eagerly staring at the Egg-Fried Rice.\u201cGet lost! Don\u2019t bother me while I am eating!\u201d Sun Qixiang impatiently waved Bu Fang away.Bu Fang pursed his lips and thought, \u201cLet\u2019s see if you\u2019re still cocky after you have the first bite.\u201dSun Qixiang was no longer paying any attention to Bu Fang and was about to begin his meal. Suddenly, he thought of something and turned towards Xiao Yanyu. By then, she had already put on her veil and was once again dignified and graceful. He said to her, \u201cI ordered a lot of dishes, do you want to eat with me?\u201dXiao Yanyu knitted her eyebrows and unexpectedly hesitated as she recalled the delicious taste of the Egg-Fried Rice. She wanted to order another serving but she did not have enough money on her and the rules of the store only allowed a serving per customer.It seemed like a pretty good choice if someone were to treat her to a meal.However, before Xiao Yanyu could reply, Bu Fang who was sitting nearby opened his mouth and said, \u201cOnly the customer that ordered the Egg-Fried Rice can eat it. If someone else eats it, then it will be viewed as a violation of our rules and the customer will be blacklisted.\u201d\u201cWhat?! Do you think I would be scared? If I want to eat, who cares about your rules! I will get someone to beat you up until you\u2019re half dead, then make you cook! What do you think a tiny little store like this can do to me?!\u201dSun Qixiang angrily stared at Bu Fang. He was about to share a meal with the beautiful Xiao Yanyu if it was not for his interruption!\u201cOh, there\u2019s one more thing that I forgot to add. Not only will you be blacklisted, if she really eats it, she will be blacklisted as well. You may not understand the seriousness of the blacklist, but\u2026 you\u2019re welcome to try,\u201d Bu Fang unhurriedly said.After Bu Fang finished speaking, Xiao Yanyu immediately dismissed any thoughts of wanting to eat Sun Qixiang\u2019s Egg-Fried Rice.Sun Qixiang coldly snorted. He was not even bothered in the slightest by Bu Fang\u2019s threat. Why would a playboy like him be afraid of the chef of a little store? So what if he was blacklisted? It was just a joke to him.Sun Qixiang did not say anything else. When he looked towards the savory dishes in front of him, his appetite suddenly surged. The Egg-Fried Rice that was radiating golden light was blinding to his eyes.As he scooped up the Egg-Fried Rice with the blue and white porcelain spoon, the rich fragrance coming from it, as if an aromatic bomb had exploded and rushed into his nasal cavities. He was captivated by it.He unhesitantly shoved the spoon into his mouth. The pearl-like rice rolled between his teeth and his tongue, it was like a massage treatment taking place in his mouth.\u201cDelicious!\u201dSun Qixiang\u2019s eyes lit up as he shoved spoon after spoon of Egg-Fried Rice into his mouth.Bu Fang\u2019s expressionless face finally broke into a smile as he watched Sun Qixiang gobble down the food.Xiao Yanyu was staring at Sun Qixiang\u2019s Egg-Fried Rice when she detected a slight chill coming from Bu Fang\u2019s body. When she looked towards him in curiosity, she witnessed the stiff smile on his face.\u201cEh? Hmm? He\u2019s\u2026 He\u2019s actually smiling?\u201dXiao Yanyu was slightly surprised. Ever since she entered the store, the impression that Bu Fang gave her was that of a cold and haughty chef. It was hard to imagine him smiling.\u201cAh!!!\u201dJust when Xiao Yanyu was focusing her attention on Bu Fang, Sun Qixiang who was enjoying his meal suddenly stopped eating and his eyes widened.Within seconds, his face turned from white to red, then red to purple!With a scream, Sun Qixiang opened his mouth and vomited out rice grains. He was hopping on the spot with his hands around his neck and his tongue hanging out of his mouth.\u201cHot\u2026 Hot! It\u2019s too hot!\u201dTears rolled down Sun Qixiang\u2019s face. He felt as if his entire body was warping and the world was not real.How could such a terrifying level of spiciness exist in this world?\u201cWater! I need to find water!\u201d Sun Qixiang ran around the little store to find water. The burning sensation in his mouth made him feel as if his entire mouth was starting to go numb and filled his face with tears.Bu Fang was sitting on a chair while he disinterestedly watched Sun Qixiang run around.Suddenly, Sun Qixiang charged towards the kitchen. Since he could not find any water in the area, he wanted to enter the kitchen to find water.Just when Sun Qixiang was about to enter the kitchen, a mechanical arm appeared out of nowhere and threw him out.\u201cThe kitchen is a restricted area, no entry to unauthorised personnel.\u201dBu Fang\u2019s robotic assistant was standing at the kitchen entrance and spoke in a mechanical voice.Xiao Yanyu and Xiao Xiaolong were speechless as they watched the scene unfold.Xiao Yanyu suddenly turned to look at Bu Fang. She thought, \u201cDid he do this? Is this his way of taking revenge? That\u2019s scary\u2026 How could he add such a terrifying chilli into gourmet food, that\u2019s totally inhumane!\u201d\u201cYoung master\u2026 Here\u2019s water!\u201dSun Qixiang\u2019s underling was very perceptive. When he saw Sun Qixiang jumping for water, he already ran out to find water and brought a water bag back.Gulp gulp!Sun Qixiang finished the entire water bag in one go before the spicy feeling in his mouth was gone. It was fortunate for him that he did not eat that much, otherwise it would have lasted much longer.\u201cYou\u2019re seeking death! How dare you tamper with my food!\u201d Sun Qixiang furiously threw the empty water bag on the floor.Bu Fang expressionlessly sat on the chair and pointed at the dish, \u201cIf you don\u2019t finish the food, that will be considered food wastage and you\u2019ll be blacklisted.\u201d\u201cBlacklist?! Don\u2019t talk to me about your stupid blacklist! I am shutting down your store today!\u201d Sun Qixiang furiously gritted his teeth and pointed at Bu Fang with his paper fan.\u201cI want you to smash this store up!!\u201dSun Qixiang said to his underling behind him.The underling immediately perked up, smashing stores was his favorite thing to do. He picked up a chair in an experienced manner and was about to swing it towards a table. However, before he could bring the chair down, he felt his arm being crushed.The underling screamed out in pain. A robot had appeared behind the underling, it reached out and easily crushed the underling\u2019s arm.\u201cTroublemaker! You\u2019ve been blacklisted and hereby prohibited from stepping into Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store.\u201d A mechanical voice solemnly declared.That underling was lifted up by the robot and gently thrown out of the store. He landed face first into the mud, wailing in pain.\u201cHow dare you retaliate?! I can easily summon a hundred men within minutes to tear down this store!\u201dSun Qixiang trembled in anger, he could not believe that a commoner would dare to go against him within the imperial city.\u201cWhitey, strip him and throw him outside. He should be punished for wasting food.\u201d Bu Fang stood up, yawned and simply said to the robot, Whitey. Then, he muttered to himself, \u201cThe opening hours is almost over, it\u2019s time to close up for the day.\u201d\u201cHow dare you ignore me? I am a third grade Battle-Maniac, killing you is no different from crushing an ant!\u201d Sun Qixiang angrily roared. His colorful robes started to flutter and glowing lights floated around his body.\u201cBang!\u201dThe robot, Whitey, slapped Sun Qixiang on the head, knocking him down on the floor and stunning him. The true energy that he gathered within his body immediately dissipated.After that, the sound of cloth being torn resounded around the little store!\u201cDamn it! Are you seriously striping me?! Do you know who I am?! I am\u2026\u201d\u201cBang!\u201d Whitey\u2019s eyes flashed and it slapped Sun Qixiang on the head once more, sending him into a daze.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSun Qixiang was stripped naked except for his underwear and everything valuable on him was taken away.

He wore a white robe, a pair of wyrm-scaled shoes and a belt inlaid with jade. He looked noble and graceful.\u201cZhao Ruge?!\u201dSun Qixiang miserably stood up with his hands covering his private parts and sullenly looked at the handsome man in front of him.\u201cI didn\u2019t know that young master Sun has such hobbies, today has been an eye-opener for me.\u201d Zhao Ruge chuckled as his eyes ran over Sun Qixiang\u2019s body and said with a weird expression on his face.Sun Qixiang\u2019s face turned bright red. He looked towards his underling who was behind Zhao Ruge, the one he sent to look for Zhao Ruge.After tearing off the clothing on his underling and putting it on, Sun Qixiang\u2019s complexion slightly improved. He did not pay any attention to Zhao Ruge but turned towards the store and furiously shouted, \u201cIf I don\u2019t smash up your store by tomorrow, my surname isn\u2019t Sun! I\u2019ll be back!\u201dAfter Sun Qixiang finished shouting, he glanced towards Zhao Ruge and said, \u201cYoung master Zhao, your dream goddess is inside the little restaurant right now. Here\u2019s a friendly reminder, there\u2019s something strange with this restaurant. The beautiful Xiao Yanyu seems to be under someone\u2019s spell.\u201dWithout even looking at Zhao Ruge\u2019s reaction, Sun Qixiang bitterly swaggered away.\u201cUnder someone\u2019s spell?\u201d The corner of Zhao Ruge\u2019s mouth slightly curled up and a meaningful smile appeared on his handsome face. He looked towards the simple and small restaurant in the alleyway.For a little restaurant set up in such a remote place to have customers, especially ones with high status like the children of the Great General Xiao Meng, Zhao Ruge would not believe that there was nothing strange going on.The wary Zhao Ruge started to walk towards the restaurant, he wanted to see what kind of a magical place it was.However, before he reached the entrance, he saw the Xiao siblings walking out with strange expressions on their faces.Xiao Yanyu was agitated at the moment. It was not because Bu Fang threw Sun Qixiang out of the store, but because of the Egg-Fried Rice. After she ate the improved Egg-Fried Rice, she found that the true energy in her body was being stimulated and the amount had increased by a lot. Even though it had not reached the point where she would advance, the level of increase was still considerable.She was amazed that a bowl of improved Egg-Fried Rice could actually increase a person\u2019s cultivation level and its effect was equivalent to that of fourth grade elixirs. There was also the fact that compared to elixirs, the taste of the Egg-Fried Rice was simply incredible.It was also no wonder that a person would need to be at least a third grade Battle-Maniac before they could eat the improved Egg-Fried Rice. The increase in true energy was more than the total true energy a second grade Battle-Master had. If a second grade Battle-Master were to eat it, not only would they not be able to advance, their bodies would explode from the sudden increase in true energy.\u201cYanyu, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d When Zhao Ruge saw Xiao Yanyu, a glimmer of gentleness appeared in his eyes. He took a step forward and softly asked.Xiao Yanyu was overjoyed with the increase in her cultivation level and completely ignored Zhao Ruge, while Xiao Xiaolong warily stared at Zhao Ruge. He could not understand the reason for Zhao Ruge to appear at that place\u2026 Then he thought of something, \u201cCould it be that it was that brat Sun Qixiang who informed him?\u201dAs the Xiao siblings walked away without paying any attention to Zhao Ruge, he got even more curious. He thought, \u201cFor Yanyu to have that kind of expression, what exactly happened here?\u201d\u201cThank you, please come again.\u201d After sending off the bewildered Xiao siblings, Bu Fang yawned and started to closing up for the day.The robot, Whitey, returned to the kitchen to continue its watch.Bu Fang picked up the last piece of door board. Before he could close up the entrance, a handsome young man appeared in front of him.\u201cShop owner, don\u2019t be so quick to close up. I would like to try out your dishes.\u201dThe handsome Zhao Ruge elegantly stood at the entrance with a smile on his face while he looked at Bu Fang. A wind blew past and caused his robes to flutter.Bu Fang expressionlessly looked at Zhao Ruge, while the latter looked at him with a smile.\u201cOh, it\u2019s time for the store to close up, please come back tomorrow.\u201dBu Fang simply said and continued to close up.The expression on Zhao Ruge\u2019s face froze, \u201cDid the shop owner just refused a customer? How does a little store like this even dare to refuse a customer?\u201d\u201cOpening hours are determined by humans\u2026 They can be changed, I am willing to pay more.\u201d Zhao Ruge thought for a while and spoke up once more.\u201cNo way,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly replied.Zhao Ruge knitted his eyebrows and said, \u201cHow about two times the original price?\u201dBu Fang thought for a while but still refused, \u201cNo way.\u201dZhao Ruge was completely stunned. He could not believe that a little store like this would refuse a customer. However, he was not about to give up!\u201cI will pay three times the original price!\u201d\u201cNo way.\u201d\u201cHow about four times the original price?!\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 No way.\u201d\u201cFive times!\u201d Zhao Ruge endured the impulse to kick Bu Fang\u2019s expressionless face and coldly said.\u201cFive times?!\u201d Bu Fang was bleeding in his heart. If it was five times the original price, a bowl of improved Egg-Fried Rice would be fifty crystals and a bowl of normal Egg-Fried Rice would be five crystals\u2026 He felt as if countless amounts of money were floating in front of his eyes.\u201cAs someone aiming to become the God of Cooking, you must have your own set of rules. You must maintain your principles and not be swayed by money! Do not bend over backwards for money!\u201dJust when Bu Fang was struggling internally and was about to agree with Zhao Ruge\u2019s offer, the system\u2019s timely intervention woke Bu Fang up.Zhao Ruge was extremely pleased. From the hesitation on Bu Fang\u2019s face, Zhao Ruge knew that Bu Fang was about to agree.He thought, \u201cHow dare the owner of a little restaurant talk about principles with me, there\u2019s no principle that doesn\u2019t break under a pile of money! If it doesn\u2019t work, then I will offer two big piles!\u201dBu Fang took in a deep breath, the expression on his face became even gloomier and uglier. He glanced at the triumphant-looking Zhao Ruge, then\u2026\u201cBang!\u201dWith a loud bang, the door board tightly sealed up the entrance, startling Zhao Ruge.\u201cWhat happened? Shop owner, are you going to let me in? Are you still open for business?\u201d What happened to his concession, what happened to his compromise? Why did he suddenly change his mind!Even with Zhao Ruge\u2019s self-control, he was still furious. Even the number one restaurant, the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant, did not have as many rules as this little store. He could not believe that a little restaurant in such a remote location would talk about principles with him!\u201cThe opening hours is finished for today. If you want to eat, come back tomorrow.\u201dThe voice of Bu Fang came from behind the tightly closed entrance, followed by a yawn. Then, there was only silence.After that, no matter how many times Zhao Ruge knocked, there was no response.The big black dog lazily lying in front of the entrance glanced at Zhao Ruge, then continued with its sleep. The only thing that the dog did other than eating was sleeping. It was a dog living the life of a pig.Zhao Ruge finally realised that he was rejected. He could not believe that a little restaurant in such a god-forsaken place would reject someone as handsome as him.He felt as if an invisible arrow had pierced into his heart.In his hands, the third grade Battle-Maniac Zhao Ruge gathered a lump of true energy. He was tempted to smash the store up.However, after he thought for a while, he gave up.\u201cFine! I will come back tomorrow and see what kind of a store would dare to reject me!\u201dZhao Ruge was the son of the Minister of the Left. As someone with such a status, everyone in the imperial city had to show him some respect. However, he was unexpectedly humiliated in a little restaurant like this, it was like getting slapped in the face.The livid Zhao Ruge dissipated the true energy he gathered in his hand, turned around and left.The big black dog continued to lay there without moving, it glanced towards Zhao Ruge as he left and rolled its eyes\u2026Bu Fang returned to his room, he had already completely forgotten about Zhao Ruge.He gave another big yawn, he had been feeling sleepy for the entire day.As he lay on the bed, he called out the system monitor.Host: Bu FangGender: MaleAge: 20True Energy Cultivation Level: First Grade (As the God of Cooking in the fantasy world, you will definitely need to make use of true energy when cooking.

This level of cultivation was incapable of any influence within the imperial city.However, what Bu Fang was puzzled about was how he suddenly obtained true energy.Was it because he completed the system mission? His first mission was to obtain his first customer, but the reward was only the improved version of Egg-Fried Rice and a fragment of the God of Cooking set. There was no mention of true energy.\u201cSystem, will I gain true energy and become stronger just by completing missions?\u201d The baffled Bu Fang asked.The system solemnly replied, \u201cThe host\u2019s true energy cultivation level is related to the amount of crystals earned. After a monetary transaction is completed, the crystals will be converted into cultivation level based on the conversion ratio. The host can monitor his cultivation level and conversion ratio in the character panel.\u201cThe current system level is at one star and the crystal conversion ratio is at ten percent. When the system level reaches two stars, more functions will be unlocked: more furniture can be used and customers may bring their own ingredients.\u201cThe host earned twenty two crystals today. According to the conversion ratio, two crystals worth of energy have been gained. The true energy level is equivalent to that of a first grade Warrior.\u201dBu Fang was speechless, he had no idea that crystals had such a purpose. However, after he gave it a thought, he realized it was natural. In the first place, crystals were a necessity to cultivators. They could increase their cultivation level by processing it. The conversion by the system was only a shortcut for Bu Fang.\u201cEh\u2026 In that case, does that mean I can become stronger just by earning crystals?\u201d An awkward smile slowly appeared on Bu Fang\u2019s face.\u201cIn order to become a second grade Battle-Master, ten crystals are needed. Third grade Battle-Maniac needs a hundred crystals. Fourth grade Battle-Spirit needs a thousand crystals. Fifth grade Battle-King needs ten thousand crystals,\u201d The system announced.Bu Fang was completely speechless.\u201cFine, there\u2019s a long way for me to go.\u201d\u201cBy the way, what did you mean by customers may bring their own ingredients?\u201d Bu Fang curiously asked.\u201cThe host can use the ingredients brought by the customers to create dishes and the price is determined by the rating of the dish given by the system,\u201d The system solemnly explained.\u201cSo that\u2019s what it was.\u201d Bu Fang\u2019s eyes slightly lit up. It was a rather considerate functionality and a method the system was using to develop his ability to earn crystals. Unfortunately, his current system level was still not enough. In this fantasy world, there were plenty of excellent ingredients for him to use. If customers were allowed to bring their own ingredients, he would surely earn a lot of crystals.In order to increase his system level, he needed to complete the missions given by it. The latest mission: please make a profit of at least a hundred crystals and a thousand gold coins within a week.Mission progress: 22/100, 100/100Bu Fang sighed inwardly, knowing that it was another mission that was far from completion.As an excellent chef, he needed to ensure that he had enough sleep. After Bu Fang exited the system panel, he slowly closed his eyes and went to sleep. The sound of even breathing could be heard after a while.The next morning.Bu Fang got up on time. After washing up, he began his daily cooking practice. Once he finished practicing all of the dishes that he learned, Bu Fang opened the store while yawning.The big black dog was still lying in front of the store. It was as if it had always been lying at the same position, without ever moving. Bu Fang was slightly astonished by it as well.\u201cGood morning, Blacky,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly greeted.The big black dog rolled its eyes and ignored him.Bu Fang was not embarrassed either. He walked back into the kitchen and placed the Egg-Fried Rice made during his practice into a bowl. When he returned, he stood in front of Blacky while carrying the bowl.\u201cIt\u2019s time to eat, Blacky,\u201d Bu Fang said.As the lazy Blacky smelled the fragrance from the bowl, it immediately became energetic. With its pink tongue hanging out, its eyes were filled with expectation as it stared at the bowl in Bu Fang\u2019s hands.Bu Fang was furious as he thought, \u201cThis gluttonous dog completely changes its attitude when there\u2019s gourmet food, then it regresses the moment it finishes eating.\u201cWhat happened to the bond between men and dogs?\u201cDoesn\u2019t he understand that it is very important to please me, the chef? He will only get a steady stream of gourmet food if I am pleased!\u201dThere was nothing Bu Fang could do about this gluttonous dog either. After he placed the bowl in front of Blacky, it started to gobble down the food while shaking its tail.Bu Fang pulled a chair over and curled up on it. He lay there comfortably while waiting for customers to show up.It was another beautiful and simple day.At that moment, a group of menacing people were flocking around the main street of the imperial city.Sun Qixiang dressed in colorful clothes was leading the group. Being one of the three most famous playboys in the imperial city, everyone on the main street avoided him while fearfully looking in his direction.Sun Qixiang was very satisfied with the way they looked at him, \u201cThat\u2019s right! That\u2019s how you should look at me! You should be afraid of me when I am so awesome!\u201d\u201cFollow me! If I don\u2019t smash up that little restaurant by today, my surname isn\u2019t Sun!\u201dAfter getting stripped and thrown out of the restaurant the day before, Sun Qixiang had nightmares throughout the night and could not sleep properly. Which was why early in the morning he gathered all of the servants under his family\u2019s employment to get even with Bu Fang.It was the first time that Sun Qixiang had to experience such an embarrassing situation, he would not be able to rest easy as long as Bu Fang was not dead.That day, Xiao Yanyu was staying at home. After eating the improved Egg-Fried Rice the previous day, her true energy level increased and she had to go into seclusion. That was why only Xiao Xiaolong was heading toward the little restaurant.However, just when he reached the main street, he saw Sun Qixiang bringing over a hundred men to thrash the restaurant.\u201cOh my heavens! I still want to eat Egg-Fried Rice! What the hell are you doing!\u201d Xiao Xiaolong was angry, where would he find Egg-Fried Rice that was delicious and would increase his cultivation level if the restaurant was gone?!As the group of over a hundred men majestically went past the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant and walked a few dozen meters more, the surroundings became silent.The alleyway that was usually deserted became crowded with people that day.Sun Qixiang\u2019s men were all holding sticks while coldly looking toward the little restaurant in the alleyway.\u201cDamn it! How dare a little restaurant in a god forsaken place bully our young master! It is practically begging to be smashed!\u201dAt the restaurant\u2019s entrance, Bu Fang was comfortably curled up on the chair while squinting his eyes as the warm sunlight enveloped his lazy figure.The big black dog was lying nearby with its tail shaking as it gobbled up the food within its food bowl.\u201cI\u2019ve come to smash your store!\u201d Sun Qixiang arrogantly pointed at Bu Fang with his paper fan and coldly shouted. He believed that Bu Fang would be afraid since he brought so many people.If Bu Fang did not get down on his knees and beg for mercy, he would not spare him!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIt was terribly quiet in the alleyway. After Sun Qixiang finished shouting, his expectation of Bu Fang begging for mercy did not come true. The latter remained curled up on his chair, basking in the sunlight.All of the servants were staring at Sun Qixiang.Sun Qixiang felt stupid and did not think that he would be ignored like this.He was extremely furious and felt as if Bu Fang had just slapped him a few times in the face.\u201cSmash it!

He could not get through as there were too many people within the alleyway and there were many spectators as well.Whether it was in another world or on Earth, there would always be onlookers. It was the natural behavior of humans. However, among the ones watching there were many that had no idea what was going on. They only gathered due to their herd mentality.While Xiao Xiaolong was thinking about how to get past the crowd, he felt someone tapping on his shoulder and turned his head in surprise.A handsome and imposing young man was looking at him. He was wearing an exquisite long robe and a hat woven from golden threads. He also had a belt with strange dancing beasts sewn on it around his waist and a piece of jade was hanging from it. He was exuding an air of gallantry and nobility.When Xiao Xiaolong saw the man, his expression changed and both his eyes and mouth widened in surprise.\u201cThird\u2026 Third\u2026\u201d Xiao Xiaolong stuttered for a while but was still unable to say it.The young man lifted up his hand to stop Xiao Xiaolong from speaking, then he faintly nodded and said, \u201cYou can just call me third young master. What are you looking at? Why are there so many people gathered here?\u201d\u201cThird young master, that Sun Qixiang is tyrannizing someone again.\u201d Xiao Xiaolong breathed a sigh of relief and was still feeling a little agitated. The identity of the young man in front of him was extraordinary.\u201cSun Qixiang? Is that the playboy son of the finance minister, Sun Qing?\u201d the third young master thought for a while before he replied.Xiao Xiaolong nodded, then joyfully asked, \u201cWhen did the third young master returned to the imperial city? I did not know at all\u2026 Does my sister know?\u201dThe third young master chuckled and said, \u201cI was specially summoned back this time, so there isn\u2019t much fanfare. Even Yanyu doesn\u2019t know, so there\u2019s no way that you would.\u201dXiao Xiaolong awkwardly fidgeted his body and embarrassedly smiled while blushing.The young man glanced at the crowd once more, then walked forward while saying, \u201cXiaolong, keep up with me. Let\u2019s get closer.\u201dThen the young man squeezed into the crowd, or to be more accurate, he walked into the crowd. That was because with every step the young man took, an invisible force would split apart the crowd in front of them.\u201cA fifth grade Battle-King is amazing, even a human wall can\u2019t stop him!\u201d Xiao Xiaolong enviously muttered while watching the elegant third young master and hurriedly followed after him.The two of them quickly made it to the front of the crowd and were just in time to witness the scene of Sun Qixiang ordering his men to smash the store.\u2026\u2026The warm sunlight was shining on Bu Fang\u2019s body, making him feel slightly lazy. Even though over a hundred men in the alleyway were clamoring to smash his store, the owner was behaving strangely calm.He was genuinely calm and not worried in the slightest.The calm expression on Bu Fang\u2019s face was also enraging Sun Qixiang. At his order, several dozen men menacingly charged toward Bu Fang.When Xiao Xiaolong saw this, he was immediately slightly anxious and wanted to intervene.However, he was confused when the young man beside him pulled him back.\u201cYoung master, why are you stopping me?\u201d\u201cThat shop owner seems to be quite confident and he doesn\u2019t seem afraid at all, so I am curious about his trump card,\u201d the young man gently smiled and said.Bu Fang was seated in the store as around a dozen men charged toward him. As one of them stepped into the shop, he viciously swung his stick at Bu Fang\u2019s head.These servants had already committed many wicked deeds under the orders of Sun Qixiang and would not have any psychological burdens as they were already used to it.\u201cBang!\u201dThe stick that was being swung was sent flying as it somersaulted through the air and fell onto the floor with a clatter.The attacking servants immediately paused as they stared at the robot standing in front of them with fear and bewilderment in their eyes.Whitey\u2019s mechanical eyes were blinking while its plump body was blocking any attempts against Bu Fang and its entire body was glimmering with a metallic luster.Whitey was a robot that the system created to manage the security of the store and waste disposal. Usually, there were no customers, so there were no security issues. However, since over a hundred men came to cause trouble, Whitey had to step out and stop them.\u201cFighting is prohibited in Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store. Those who violate the rules, shall be stripped to make an example to others.\u201dThe mechanical voice came out from Whitey\u2019s mouth, it sounded slightly comical as it echoed throughout the alleyway.The group of servants were speechless. \u201cWhere did this hunk of metal come out from? It actually dared to block the way of over a hundred men?\u201dEven though the average cultivation level in the group was weak, with the strongest only being a first grade Warrior, there were still a lot of them.Although there was quite a difference between the strength of a Warrior and a Battle-Master, when there was a large enough difference in the numbers, Warriors could still overwhelm Battle-Masters.Since the puppet-like robot in front of them did not have any true energy circulating within its body, they were not worried at all.\u201cThat\u2019s the hunk of metal, tear it to pieces now!\u201dWhen Sun Qixiang saw Whitey, his eyes turned red and he was instantly furious. \u201cHow dare it even mention stripping!\u201dHaving received the order from Sun Qixiang, the servants charged toward the store once more.However, the next scene made them all stop. The servant charging at the very front was thrown out and his clothes were torn off instantly, leaving only a loincloth to cover his private parts.Then the second, and the third\u2026One by one, the servants that charged into the store went in with their clothes but were thrown out without them and their almost naked bodies landed in the alleyway.\u201cHow filthy.\u201d One of the female onlookers was blushing and covering her face with her hands. However, her hands were wide open and her eyes were looking through the gaps between her fingers\u2026 Her face was completely red.As Sun Qixiang watched his naked servants flying out of the restaurant one by one, his face was almost purple from anger.\u201cYou bunch of idiots! Don\u2019t you know that you should all charge at once?! Why would you go in one by one!\u201dHis enraged voice immediately woke up the servants. They looked at each other and immediately charged toward Whitey while brandishing their sticks. Five of them charged into the narrow store at once, but the results were the same.No matter how many people went in, the same amount of people flew out. All of their clothes were collected by Whitey and stored into his stomach as trash.In the blink of an eye, over a hundred men were wailing on the floor.Sun Qixiang\u2019s legs were trembling and was unable to comprehend what just happened\u2026Even a third grade Battle-Maniac would need to go the other way when encountering over a hundred men. He could never imagine that a little restaurant in such a god forsaken place would have such a powerful iron puppet.Bu Fang was calmly sitting behind Whitey the entire time as he expressionlessly watched the scene unfold.He only lazily stood up and yawned after all of Sun Qixiang\u2019s servants were defeated.As Bu Fang stood at the entrance of the little store, he looked down at the sullen Sun Qixiang and faintly said, \u201cWhitey, strip that guy as well. This guy affected my mood to cook today, I\u2019ll be annoyed if he doesn\u2019t receive some punishment.\u201d\u201cUnderstood!\u201dThe mechanical voice of Whitey sounded out. Sun Qixiang\u2019s expression changed and he immediately turned around to run away. However, Whitey\u2019s arm suddenly separated from its torso, flying over tens of meters to grab onto Sun Qixiang\u2019s clothes and pulled him into the store.\u201cTroublemaker in Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store, you will be stripped as an example to others,\u201d Whitey said with a mechanical voice.Sun Qixiang wanted to cry as he felt that he was wronged. \u201cAren\u2019t you the one who dragged me into the store?\u201d\u201cBang!\u201dSun Qixiang\u2019s naked body once again flew out and landed into the alleyway. Over a hundred naked bodies huddled together, forming a beautiful\u2026 landscape\u201cOh\u2026 This scene is too filthy!\u201d That female onlooker was still looking through the gaps between her fingers as her face blushed\u2026Sun Qixiang was too embarrassed to stay there. He brought over a hundred men to take revenge, but the result was\u2026It was a tragedy.The large group of men that majestically arrived went back in an even more majestic manner, with nothing on them. This incident created a great ripple within the imperial city. As they went through the main street, it caused countless onlookers to gather around them and even caused a brief breakdown in the pedestrian traffic.The crowded alleyway soon started to empty and the crowd dispersed. The only ones left were people attracted by the store.\u201cThere was actually a restaurant in this alleyway? Even though I\u2019ve been living in the imperial city for so many years, I didn\u2019t know about this!\u201d a woman exclaimed in surprise.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIt looks like this restaurant has some backing, otherwise they wouldn\u2019t dare to strip young master Sun!\u201d an old man remarked.\u201cThat robot is very cute!

Even though everyone was complaining about the remote location of the restaurant, they still entered out of curiosity.A woman stepped into Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store while carrying a child with a runny nose. The hygiene in the cramped store was very clean, while the immaculate surface of the table showed the attentive nature of the shop owner. The ambiance was set up in a hospitable manner, in order to provide comfort to the customers.Just from the decoration, you could tell that it was a high quality store.\u201cOh my, shop owner, what do you sell here? Your store\u2019s decoration is really impressive, it\u2019s comparable to the suites at the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant!\u201d the woman said as she wiped off the mucus of the child in her arms and rubbed it off on her clothes.Bu Fang was expressionlessly staring at the woman\u2019s hands.\u201cYou sound as if you\u2019ve been to places like the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant! Stop bragging, woman!\u201d the old man disdainfully snorted.The woman was instantly aggravated by his words. She placed her child down and put her hands on her hips. She was staring at the old man with wide eyes and was ready to duel the old man in a battle of wits.\u201cExcuse me, customers. If you\u2019re looking to order, the menu is right behind you. If you\u2019re looking to duel, please do it outside.\u201d Bu Fang simply said, interrupting the great battle that was about to occur between the two neighbors.The woman coldly snorted, only stopping since she remembered that it was someone else\u2019s store. She turned to look at the menu while still muttering under her breath, \u201cI can tell that you\u2019re not a bad lad and I know that running a business isn\u2019t easy, so this old lady will help out a little. I\u2019ll order a serving of\u2026\u201dThe woman suddenly stopped talking and was staring at the menu in disbelief as the corner of her mouth twitched violently!The old man was puzzled by her behavior, so he turned his head toward the woman and saw her expression. When he followed her gaze, he almost vomited blood.\u201cOh my god! A bowl of Egg-Fried Rice costs a crystal? A plate of Stir-Fried Vegetables costs a hundred gold coins?! Why don\u2019t you go rob a bank or something?!\u201d The old man was so shocked that his beard almost fell out from his trembling.The woman\u2019s plump body was trembling as well as she said with a piercing voice, \u201cLad, this is unethical! With this kind of price, who would dare to eat here?!\u201dThe old man and the woman who were originally adversaries suddenly joined forces against Bu Fang.Meanwhile, he remained indifferent and expressionless.\u201cThere\u2019s a reason for the prices. If you\u2019re eating, then please make an order. If you\u2019re not eating, then please leave.\u201dAs someone aiming to become the God of Cooking, Bu Fang had his pride.The woman looked at Bu Fang as if he was insane, then she quickly left with her child in tow. The hunchbacked old man shook his head as he walked out of the store.Bu Fang was not surprised by their reactions as it was all within his expectations. The price of the dishes meant that he would lose a lot of customers, since not everyone could afford the terrifying prices.Most of the people that entered the store reacted the same way as the woman and left while grumbling.The crowd disappeared as quickly as it appeared.The lively Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store returned to its former desolate state and no one wanted to spend any money there.Xiao Xiaolong brought the young man into the little restaurant.He was looking slightly excited. \u201cSince my elder sister isn\u2019t here, I think I should have enough crystals to eat a bowl of improved Egg-Fried Rice.\u201dSince the improved version of Egg-Fried Rice required the customer to be at least a third grade Battle-Maniac before they could order, it was obvious that this dish would be extraordinary. Previously, the ordinary Egg-Fried Rice helped him to advance past a bottleneck, surely the improved Egg-Fried Rice would have better effects!\u201cXiaolong, so you are saying that the Egg-Fried Rice in this restaurant is delicious?\u201d The young man stood with his hands around his back as he gave off an aura of excellence. He glanced around the store and simply said.\u201cThat\u2019s right! Third young master, the Egg-Fried Rice here is the most delicious I\u2019ve ever eaten! Even my family\u2019s chef\u2026 No! Even the Egg-Fried Rice cooked by your family\u2019s chef is far inferior to this restaurant\u2019s!\u201dAs Xiao Xiaolong recalled the taste of Bu Fang\u2019s Egg-Fried Rice, he dreamily squinted his eyes and a satisfied expression appeared on his face.The third young master was slightly surprised, he did not expect Xiao Xiaolong to give such a high evaluation. His family\u2019s chef was not an ordinary chef, and yet, the Egg-Fried Rice made by a store in such a remote location was superior?The third young master\u2019s interest was suddenly piqued and he turned to look at the menu.That ridiculously high price that was intolerable to ordinary people caused the third young master to be slightly astonished. He raised his eyebrows and a look of disbelief appeared on his handsome face.\u201cThe Egg-Fried Rice is paid for with crystals? And the improved version costs ten crystals? There\u2019s also a minimum requirement for cultivation level as well?\u201dThe price and rules on the menu completely changed the way the third young master saw the world, he never knew Egg-Fried Rice could be sold for such an expensive price.\u201cThird young master, trust me. My elder sister ate the improved Egg-Fried Rice yesterday and she had to go into seclusion today! Her cultivation level improved by a small grade!\u201d Xiao Xiaolong said.\u201cOh? Is that so?\u201d The third young master was amazed. Xiao Yanyu was already a fourth grade Battle-Spirit, so how could a single bowl of Egg-Fried Rice help to increase her cultivation level?Would it still be Egg-Fried Rice? Should it not be egg-fried elixirs?\u201cShop owner, I would like to have the improved Egg-Fried Rice. My cultivation level meets the requirement, there\u2019s no need for testing.\u201d The third young master gently said to the indifferent Bu Fang who was standing nearby.\u201cI want a bowl of improved Egg-Fried Rice as well!\u201d Xiao Xiaolong hurriedly said, but his words were interrupted by the third young master.The third young master narrowed his eyes and petted Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s head with a gentle smile on his face. He said, \u201cXiaolong, how many crystals did you bring?\u201dThe expression on Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s face froze. \u201cWhy are these words so familiar?\u201d\u201cTe\u2026 Ten crystals!\u201d\u201cHmm, then it\u2019s enough.\u201dXiao Xiaolong sullenly looked at his peony sachet, now in the third young master\u2019s hand. He felt as if ten thousand invisible arrows had pierced into his chest.\u201cI\u2019ll treat you next time.\u201d The third young master smiled and said, \u201cI forgot to bring money today.\u201dXiao Xiaolong\u2019s eyes were filled with tears. \u201cWhy is it so difficult to eat a bowl of Egg-Fried Rice?\u201d\u201cShop owner, I want a portion of Dry-Mixed Noodles and one of Stir-Fried Vegetables.\u201dBu Fang expressionlessly nodded.\u201cOne serving of improved Egg-Fried Rice, one serving of Dry-Mixed Noodles and one serving of Stir-Fried Vegetables. Alright, please wait a moment,\u201d Bu Fang repeated the order, then went into the kitchen.Xiao Xiaolong and the third young master sat down at a table. The third young master was very pleased with the elegant environment.\u201cI didn\u2019t know that such an elegant restaurant like this existed in the imperial city, I am surprised that we didn\u2019t notice it before. Hmm? Where\u2019s the puppet that fought against the hundred men?\u201d The third young master looked around.He had a deep impression of Whitey, he was amazed by the intelligence displayed by the puppet.On the Hidden Dragon Continent, sects were commonplace while empires were the reigning power. Only empires were recognized, while both Orthodox and Heterodox Sects were not.The current emperor of the Light Wind Empire, Emperor Changfeng, had been reigning for over seventy years. He forcefully conscripted members of sects into his army. The sects that accepted the conscription were scattered into various troops, while the ones that did not abide were attacked.The Light Wind Empire was founded over a thousand years ago. It was founded when the power of the sects were at its peak and they fought constantly. After over a thousand years of development, the sects were slowly weakened under the influence of the empire. After two failed \u201cSect Uprising\u201d attempts, they were completely suppressed by the empire.On the current Hidden Dragon Continent, there were only a few hundred sects left. Compared to the golden age where there were tens of thousands of sects, it was in a wretched state.Of the few hundred sects that still survived, there were only ten sects that still struggled against the empire.The third young master had once met a declined sect that spent their time researching the art of puppetry and had already reached a superb level. He was thinking whether the puppet in this store was related to that sect.However, there was quite a difference between Whitey and the puppets from that sect, as there was no true energy circulating within its body. Thus, the chances of Bu Fang being a remnant of that sect was low.Just when he was thinking about the issue, a burst of fragrance drifted out from the kitchen.The smell was like a piece of silk sliding across his face, causing the third young master to suddenly open his eyes as it triggered his appetite.\u201cIt smells good!\u201d he exclaimed.Xiao Xiaolong was already immersed in the sea of fragrance, and his eyes became hazy.The third young master felt that the smell itself was already comparable to dishes cooked by his family\u2019s chef and might even be better.After a while, Bu Fang stepped out of the kitchen.He was expressionlessly carrying a blue and white porcelain bowl and the top part of the bowl was shrouded in a rich fragrance.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHere\u2019s your improved Egg-Fried Rice, please enjoy your meal.\u201dBu Fang placed the bowl in front of the third young master and simply said, then he returned to the kitchen.The third young master took in a deep breath and a burst of fragrance traveled through his nasal cavities into his body. It triggered his appetite as a wave of hunger assaulted him.The rich fragrance gathered above the top of the bowl. As he pierced the surface of the Egg-Fried Rice with his spoon, the gathered fragrance dispersed like an explosion of an aroma bomb.The resulting explosion of the aroma bomb immediately rushed toward the third young master.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was like the pearl-like rice grains were jumping around in his mouth. The smell of the rice mixed with the eggs was like a cloud that clustered around his body, giving him the feeling of being immersed in a sea of fragrance.The third young master was captivated as he had never tasted such a delicious Egg-Fried Rice before. He thought that Xiao Xiaolong was right about the fact that his family\u2019s chef could not make Egg-Fried Rice that tasted this good.After swallowing the first spoon of Egg-Fried Rice, the second spoon immediately entered his mouth. In front of delicious food, the only thought left in his mind was to devour it. The greatest respect a person could show to a chef was to completely immerse themselves in the food.As Xiao Xiaolong enviously watched the scene, his appetite was already triggered. The richness of the smell of the Egg-Fried Rice was simply unbelievable. It was like the smell was gathered together, then was released at once.Bu Fang was indifferently watching the third young master devour the food as the corner of his mouth widened into a smile. In front of delicious food, a person\u2019s identity did not matter. Even an emperor would be captivated by delicious food. He did not know the identity of the third young master and he was not interested either. At that moment, he only knew that the third young master was his customer and that was enough for him.Soon Bu Fang returned to the kitchen. He expertly took out the dough and kneaded it, then he pulled it into noodles and soaked it inside hot water. The cooked noodles were then placed into a bowl filled with seasoning that was already prepared. Using chopsticks to mix the noodles with the seasoning, a bowl of piping hot Dry-Mixed Noodles was ready.After the Dry-Mixed Noodles was done, Bu Fang did not serve it immediately. Instead, he took out a bundle of vegetables from the freezer.The vegetables were turquoise green and the leaves were lush and shiny. There were even water droplets on it that had not dried off yet. The droplets reflected the light and emitted warm rays.\u201cThese vegetables are wild Purple Ling Vegetables picked from the mid mountain area of Mount Tiandang[1]. It has to receive sunlight for three hours and an hour of moisturizing from the mountain rain everyday. The soil needs to be watered with the water from the crater lake in Mount Tiandang. In order to preserve its vitality and nutritions, it should be harvested early in the morning when the dew has not disappeared yet.\u201dThe system\u2019s explanation of the vegetable instantly appeared in Bu Fang\u2019s mind. He was startled by how fancy it sounded, it was no wonder that a plate of Stir-Fried Vegetables could cost a hundred gold coins.Mount Tiandang was a well-known mountain on the Hidden Dragon Continent. At the very top of the mountain, there was a crater lake. The water in the crater lake was actually full of spirit energy that was gathered from the world. If a person were to drink the water, it would augment the meridians in their body and their cultivation level would increase.It was not the first time that Bu Fang prepared this dish and he had already reached a miraculous level when it came to cooking it after practicing so many times.When Bu Fang removed the vegetables from the frying pan and placed them on a plate, it looked the exact same way before he started cooking it, like it had not been stir fried at all.The truth was that it was only able to retain all of its moisture due to Bu Fang\u2019s meticulous control of the heat when cooking.He carried both the Dry-Mixed Noodles and Stir-Fried Vegetables out of the kitchen and placed them in front of Xiao Xiaolong.\u201cYour Dry-Mixed Noodles and Stir-Fried Vegetables, please enjoy your meal,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly said.Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s eyes immediately lit up as he grabbed the bowl of Dry-Mixed Noodles and started to gobble it down. He had been enduring his hunger since he saw the third young master eating.By the time Xiao Xiaolong started eating, the third young master had already finished his meal. The quantity of the Egg-Fried Rice was too little, so it was quickly finished. However, even though the quantity was not much, the quality was good!\u201cIt\u2019s delicious!\u201d The third young master resisted the urge to lick the bowl clean and gave a thumbs up to Bu Fang.\u201cShop owner, your Egg-Fried Rice is excellent. I am sure the ingredients are not ordinary as I can feel the spirit energy within the Egg-Fried Rice. As I was eating, I could actually feel my true energy level increase. Even though the increase wasn\u2019t much, it is already hard to come by for me.\u201dThe third young master continuously gave praises. The fact, that a fifth grade Battle-King like him was able to experience a small amount of increase, had already proven that the Egg-Fried Rice was extraordinary.\u201cIf I didn\u2019t guess wrongly, the egg used is from a fifth stage demonic beast, the Deep Sea Foal Eagle!\u201dBu Fang looked at the third young master in surprise as he did not expect him to be able to guess the origin of the egg.\u201cImproved version of Egg-Fried Rice: The egg used is the first egg laid by the fifth stage demonic beast, Deep Sea Foal Eagle. Due to the nourishment and impact by sea energy from the deep sea, the egg contains a rich amount of spirit energy. The rice used is the Wuchang Monarch Rice from the Southern Wastelands. Its grains are plump and it is full of nutritions. It is chosen as the royal tribute to the emperor.\u201d\u201cI knew it.\u201d the third young master thought as a gentle smile appeared on his face. He was correct, the egg was from the fifth stage demonic beast, Deep Sea Foal Eagle. He once tasted the egg before, but it was not made into Egg-Fried Rice. He ate it as fried eggs, but the rich flavor that it produced was still unbelievable.On the other hand, the third young master paid no heed to the rice since he was familiar with it. He also noticed the plate of Stir-Fried Vegetables that Xiao Xiaolong ordered and clearly remembered that it cost a hundred gold coins.It was not cheap, so he was curious about what was so special about it.\u201cIs there anything special about the vegetables?\u201d The third young master curiously asked.\u201cThese vegetables are wild Purple Ling Vegetables picked from the mid mountain area of Mount Tiandang. It is picked early in the morning to preserve the spirit energy,\u201d Bu Fang replied.When the third young master heard that they were Purple Ling Vegetables, he realized the reason for the price.Purple Ling Vegetables was a type of expensive vegetable that could only grow in extremely strict conditions. However, it was an excellent ingredient as it was nutritious and would augment the meridians in the body.If it was Purple Ling Vegetables, then a hundred gold coins would be considered cheap.\u201cIs it that formidable?\u201d Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s mouth was covered in oil from the noodles. When he heard the conversation between Bu Fang and the third young master, his eyes lit up as he muttered to himself.Swallowing the noodles in his mouth, Xiao Xiaolong picked up the lush and raw-looking Purple Ling Vegetable leaf with his chopsticks.\u201cIs this really cooked?\u201d Xiao Xiaolong skeptically asked.He was only certain that the leaf was cooked after he took a sniff and smelled a light fragrance coming from it.He placed the leaf into his mouth and a crunching noise sounded out as he lightly bit down. Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s eyes immediately widened in surprise. He felt as if a cold stream was emanating from inside his mouth. The stream tasted of light sweetness and enveloped his taste buds, refreshing him. It flowed down his esophagus and entered his stomach, then expanded into his four limbs. The feeling was indescribable, it was like countless beauties were massaging his body with their soft hands.\u201cIs this really vegetables?!\u201d Xiao Xiaolong was shocked. It was his first time eating this kind of Stir-Fried Vegetables and he could not describe how he felt at the moment.\u201cThis dish of Stir-Fried Vegetables is a test of a chef\u2019s skill. It needs to retain all of its moisture and nutrients, which requires the chef to be extremely proficient at controlling the heat and grasping the right timing,\u201d The third young master commented, then swallowed his saliva.Bu Fang nodded in agreement. The third young master was correct. Stir-Fried Vegetables was the most demanding in terms of skills among Bu Fang\u2019s dishes.\u201cMay I have the pleasure of knowing your name?\u201d The third young master suddenly stood up and gently smiled at Bu Fang.\u201cMy family name is Bu, my given name is Fang,\u201d Bu Fang was startled and replied in a straightforward manner.\u201cI see, so you\u2019re Owner Bu. I am very impressed by your culinary skills. I\u2019ll be honest with you, I am Ji Chengxue, the third prince of the Light Wind Empire.\u201d The third young master faintly smiled as the confident aura of a royalty emanated from his body.Xiao Xiaolong was stunned. \u201cWhy did the young master suddenly reveal his identity?\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly looked at Ji Chengxue, while thinking, \u201cSo this fellow is a prince. A prince\u2026 Is that something impressive?\u201dWhen Ji Chengxue saw that Bu Fang was not surprised by his identity, he was slightly bewildered.\u201cWould Owner Bu be interested in becoming my personal chef? Rest assured that your salary will be satisfactory, how about a hundred crystals per month?\u201d Ji Chengxue said with a smile. He believed that Bu Fang would not reject such an offer.It was the dream of many chefs in the empire to become his personal chef because it was a chance to instantly achieve fame and recognition.Besides, a salary of a hundred crystals per month was even higher than what the imperial chefs received.Xiao Xiaolong was stunned once more by the third prince\u2019s unethical actions. Was he trying to headhunt Owner Bu? How was he going to find delicious Egg-Fried Rice that raised his cultivation level in the future?!\u201cOwner Bu, you need to hang on! You can\u2019t give in to temptations!\u201d Xiao Xiaolong shouted in his mind.Bu Fang expressionlessly looked at the confident third prince, Ji Chengxue, while the latter was expectantly looking at him.\u201cOh\u2026 You want me to become your personal chef?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d\u201cSorry, but you\u2019re not qualified.\u201dUnder Ji Chengxue\u2019s expectant gaze, Bu Fang simply replied.\u2014[1] Mount Tiandang (\u5929\u8569\u5c71) \u2013 This is an actual mountain in China.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As the third prince of the empire, there were many people who would like to be associated with him. In spite of that, his personal invitation was just cruelly rejected.More importantly, the reason for the rejection was\u2026\u201cYou\u2019re not qualified.\u201dAs Ji Chengxue recalled Bu Fang\u2019s words and that expressionless appearance, he felt as if an invisible arrow had pierced into his heart.However, Ji Chengxue was an astute person. Even though he was rejected, he did not display any signs of anger and only lightly smiled.\u201cThat\u2019s right, I\u2026 really am not qualified,\u201d Ji Chengxue dismayingly exclaimed, as if something had stirred in his heart.Emperor Changfeng of Light Wind Empire had three sons. The first prince, Ji Chengan was conferred as the crown prince ten years ago. While the second prince, Ji Chengyu was conferred as a king. Only the third prince, Ji Chengxue, had somehow earned the displeasure of Emperor Changfeng and was only a general in the army.Even though the position of a general was highly respected, it was quite shabby compared to the first and second princes.\u201cThird prince\u2026\u201d When Xiao Xiaolong saw the depressed look on Ji Chengxue, he wanted to say something but was interrupted by Ji Chengxue.\u201cOwner Bu, even though you\u2019re not interested in becoming my chef, have you ever thought of entering the imperial kitchen and becoming the personal chef of the emperor?\u201cI may not be qualified, but the emperor should be qualified,\u201d Ji Chengxue said with a chuckle.Bu Fang glanced at Ji Chengxue and knitted his eyebrows. \u201cIs this guy an idiot? Was I not clear enough?\u201d\u201cI am not interested in becoming anyone\u2019s personal chef, not even the emperor\u2019s. If you want to eat my food, then come to my store. Queue up if there\u2019s someone ahead of you and pay up when you\u2019ve finished eating.\u201dBu Fang was someone aiming to become the God of Cooking, how could the future God of Cooking restrict himself by becoming anyone\u2019s personal chef.Ji Chengxue became silent. He could understand when Bu Fang refused to become his chef. However, he thought it was unbelievable that Bu Fang would refuse to become the chef of the emperor.Was it not the dream of all chefs to enter the imperial kitchen and cook for the emperor?Then what was Bu Fang\u2019s dream?\u201cThe improved version of Egg-Fried Rice costs ten crystals. Please pay up, thank you,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly said, he was tired of speaking with the prince.\u201cYours is two hundred gold coins,\u201d At the same time, he turned to Xiao Xiaolong and said.Ji Chengxue meaningfully glanced at Bu Fang and gave him ten crystals. Xiao Xiaolong paid his bill as well and then both of them left the store.A little store that was only ten square metres and did not even have a signboard with a big black dog lying at the entrance. A slim and tall chef with unyielding principles and a mysterious puppet as his assistant, while having perfect culinary skills and high-grade ingredients of unknown origins\u2026 Fang Fang Little\u2019s Store exuded mysteriousness.After Ji Chengxue exited the store, he glanced back and the corner of his mouth curled up. \u201cHow interesting.\u201dAfter collecting the tableware and washing them up, the store became deserted once more. Bu Fang was once again sitting next to the lazy Blacky and basking in the sun.However, the existence of the store was publicized thanks to the little incident with Sun Qixiang. News of the exorbitant dishes in the store had also circulated throughout the imperial city due to the overreaction of his neighbors.\u201cHave you guys heard about the bizarre restaurant in that alleyway!\u201d\u201cAre you talking about the blackhearted restaurant that\u2019s selling a bowl of Egg-Fried Rice for ten crystals?\u201d\u201cIs the owner an idiot? Why would anyone eat there with that kind of price? If any of his Egg-Fried Rice actually sells, I will eat all of the biscuits in my biscuit stall!\u201d\u2026There would always be some wealthy people in the world with different pursuits from ordinary people. Even the way they viewed things was different as well.Bu Fang\u2019s peace did not last long as several figures stepped into the store. He was lazily curled up on the chair as he glanced at the group of obese men that had just arrived.These obese men were all wearing luxurious silk clothings and their coarse fingers were adorned with gold rings. They wore jade amulets around their necks and their belts were embedded with emerald jades.\u201cWhat a distinctive group of nouveau riche,\u201d Bu Fang thought to himself.\u201cShop owner! I heard that the dishes in your store are very expensive and that they\u2019re even more expensive than dishes from the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant! We believe that the more expensive something is, the better the quality will be. If your dishes can satisfy our palate, then the price isn\u2019t an issue,\u201d The leader of the group, an obese man dressed in luxurious clothes and accessories, said in a loud voice.As they crowded into the little store, they astonishingly took up most of the available spaces. Bu Fang expressionlessly stood up and asked, \u201cWhat do you want to eat?\u201dThe leader glanced at the menu and his eyes narrowed. Even this affluent group of obese men sucked in a breath of cold air when they saw the price of the Egg-Fried Rice.\u201cGood, your store is as incredible as expected! Give me a bowl of improved Egg-Fried Rice!\u201d The obese man said.\u201cHere\u2019s a friendly reminder, you need to be at least a third grade Battle-Maniac to eat the improved Egg-Fried Rice. Don\u2019t order it if your cultivation level is not up to par,\u201d Bu Fang simply said.\u201cOur elder brother is known by people in the imperial city as \u2018Qinggong Iljimae[1]\u2019, how could his cultivation level be lower than Battle-Maniac! You just have to cook the food!\u201d The other obese men started to clamor.Bu Fang\u2019s expression did not change but he covertly glanced toward the obese man, and thought, \u201cWith a figure like that, how could there be any relations to Iljimae?\u201dIn the end, this group of obese men ordered three servings of improved Egg-Fried Rice, four servings of ordinary Egg-Fried Rice, seven servings of Dry-Mixed Noodles, and seven servings of Stir-Fried Vegetables.Even for someone as calm as Bu Fang, the corner of his mouth was twitching as he thought, \u201cAs expected of people with such body sizes, they really can eat!\u201dTo be able to eat was a blessing. Bu Fang liked people who could eat well.He entered the kitchen and focused all of his energy into cooking. After a while, a rich fragrance drifted out of the kitchen and enveloped the store.\u201cThis smells so good! I\u2019ve never smelled anything as good as this!\u201d This group of obese men intoxicatedly narrowed their eyes and inhaled deeply.They were looking forward more and more to the dish.As the group of obese men was waiting for their orders, a tall and elegant figure approached the entrance of the store.When Zhao Ruge saw the mountain of flesh within the store, the expression on his face immediately changed.\u201cWhy is there so many people?\u201d Zhao Ruge was slightly surprised.\u201cFatty Jin? I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d Zhao Ruge quickly recognized one of the obese man in the group.Jin Fugui, also known as Fatty Jin, was a famous nouveau riche in the imperial city. His family had monopoly over a crystal mine, so he was very rich.The other fat men were also rich and famous people within the imperial city.\u201cWhy are these fellows eating at this kind of store? Don\u2019t they feel that this isn\u2019t the type of place that they should be eating at?\u201d\u201cGet out of the way, let me go in.\u201d As Zhao Ruge\u2019s paper fan lightly touched one of the obese man, the obese man\u2019s body trembled and opened up a path.Using this open path, Zhao Ruge squeezed into the store and coincidentally encountered Bu Fang, who had just came out of the kitchen with a bowl of Egg-Fried Rice in his hands.The rich fragrance was like silk wrapping around Zhao Ruge, enveloping him within the aromatic explosion.\u201cShop owner, hurry up and serve the dish! We can\u2019t wait any more!\u201d Fatty Jin impatiently shouted as the flesh on his face trembled violently.\u201cHere\u2019s your improved version of Egg-Fried Rice, please enjoy your meal,\u201d Bu Fang put down the bowl and simply said, then he turned around to return to the kitchen.Zhao Ruge woke up from his stupor and was surprised by Bu Fang\u2019s culinary skills, \u201cNo wonder Yanyu was lured into this place; his cooking skills isn\u2019t ordinary.\u201d\u201cWait, prepare my improved Egg-Fried Rice first,\u201d Zhao Ruge demandingly said to Bu Fang.\u201cHey! Beanpole! Don\u2019t you know about first-come, first-served?\u201d When one of the obese man saw Zhao Ruge trying to jump the queue, he was immediately annoyed and loudly shouted at him.Zhao Ruge disdainfully glanced at the obese man, then he coldly laughed and said, \u201cWhy would I need to be served after you? Who the hell are you to question me?\u201d\u201cDamn it! I\u2019m so angry!\u201d That obese man was immediately enraged. \u201cI am the owner of Fairview Square! Who the hell are you, brat?!\u201d\u201cI am Zhao Ruge.\u201d He simply said.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhao Ruge, son of the Minister of the Left, was extremely noble. Once he announced his name, the obese man was immediately speechless and was staring at him with wide eyes.Then the obese man bitterly glanced at Zhao Ruge with a face filled with reluctance.\u201cFine\u2026 Your father is more capable than me, I won\u2019t compete with you.\u201d\u2014[1] Iljimae is a fictional character, also known as the korean Robin Hood.

He never showed off the fact that he was the son of the Minister of the Left because he did not want to grow up under his father\u2019s shadow.Strictly speaking, Zhao Ruge was not a playboy like Sun Qixiang because he was an idealist. He hoped that one day when people mentioned Zhao Ruge, they would first think of him instead of his identity as the son of the Minister of the Left.That was why Zhao Ruge learned martial arts when he was five years old, studied poetry and literature when he was nine and was familiar with the Hundred Schools of Thought by the time he was fifteen. He wanted to become a master of stratagems, so he needed the necessary knowledge and experience.Even though he did not achieve any stunning achievements in recent years, his efforts were not in vain. At the very least, his name was feared by many people within the imperial city.Fatty Jin was one of them. As the affluent owner of a crystal mine, he had no choice but to deal with court officials. That was why he knew much more than others, like the fact that Zhao Ruge devised a strategy to kill a fifth grade Battle-King from a Sect.He knew that Zhao Ruge was a ruthless, meticulous, tenacious and ambitious person.\u201cSince young master Zhao wishes to order first, then let him go first,\u201d Fatty Jin said while lifting up his head and continuing to eat his food. He did not wish to see his buddies clash with that insidious Zhao Ruge, otherwise they might die one day without even knowing why.The other obese men could only bitterly step back.Zhao Ruge was very pleased with their reactions. He disdainfully glanced at them and arrogantly sneered.Bu Fang had been indifferently looking on since the beginning. He did not say anything and could not be bothered to do so.At last, Zhao Ruge looked at Bu Fang once more and demandingly said, \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you gone in to cook my food? What are you waiting for?\u201dBu Fang was expressionless as he indifferently replied, \u201cOur store\u2019s rules are: takeout is forbidden; each customer can order each dish only once per day; creating a disturbance is forbidden; queue jumping is forbidden; and the opening hours lasts three hours.\u201d\u201cAre you emphasizing that queue jumping is forbidden?\u201d Zhao Ruge chuckled, he did not think much of it. It was only the rules of a little store in a remote alleyway. Rules were made by men and were meant to be broken.Bu Fang knitted his eyebrows and solemnly said, \u201cNo, I am emphasizing that creating a disturbance and queue jumping is forbidden. Also\u2026 the opening hours lasts three hours and there is only half an hour left.\u201d\u201cIf I am telling you to cook my food, then you should go and cook them! You\u2019re just a mere cook, what\u2019s with all this nonsense! The fact that I am eating here is a great honor for you. Don\u2019t push your luck,\u201d Zhao Ruge was getting tired of speaking with Bu Fang and his expression turned cold as he angrily shouted. Then he kicked an obese man sitting nearby to make him give up his seat.Here was another idiot who offended the future God of Cooking.Bu Fang was still expressionless. \u201cRulebreakers will be blacklisted and the store will no longer provide any services to them, so please queue up accordingly.\u201dAfter Bu Fang finished what he wanted to say, he entered the kitchen and completely ignored the enraged Zhao Ruge who was banging the table.After a while, a bowl of Egg-Fried Rice was ready. Bu Fang carried it out and placed it in front of one of the obese man, ignoring the outraged Zhao Ruge.Another Egg-Fried Rice was completed, but Zhao Ruge was still not being served.After Bu Fang continuously cooked seven servings of Egg-Fried Rice, a rich fragrance had completely enveloped the store, it was as if the store had transformed into a sea of fragrance. Zhao Ruge, who was immersed within it, felt as if time seemed to stretched on forever. His stomach was continuously rumbling.\u201cWhat are you doing! Why is my Egg-Fried Rice still not done yet?!\u201d Zhao Ruge, who had been waiting for quite some time, could not endure it any more.Bu Fang simply glanced at him and said, \u201cThere are still three servings of Dry-Mixed Noodles and three servings of Stir-Fried Vegetables before your Egg-Fried Rice.\u201dZhao Ruge took in a deep breath. As the raging anger within his chest started to sprout, his hair fluttered around in the air and bright lights circulated on his skin.\u201cI really don\u2019t understand, what exactly gave a cook like you the courage to challenge me?\u201d Zhao Ruge\u2019s pupils seemed to be twinkling as a terrifying aura emanated from his body.Zhao Ruge\u2019s cultivation level was at third grade Battle-Maniac and was in the upper tier even within the younger generation in the imperial city. Although he was nothing compared to monsters like Xiao Yanyu from Xiao manor and the son of the \u2018Marquis that Protects the Country\u2019 Yang Chen, he was far superior to playboys like Sun Qixiang.\u201cAre you trying to start a fight in the store?\u201dBu Fang was not frightened at all. Even though the aura coming from Zhao Ruge was very powerful, he was not affected at all.\u201cSo what if I am?\u201d Zhao Ruge sneered as he held out his palm and a stream of true energy gathered in his palm.\u201cBefore you came, over a hundred men came to smash the store and ended up running home naked. Do you want to nude streak as well?\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly asked.Zhao Ruge slightly hesitated, then disdainfully smiled and said, \u201cDon\u2019t compare me with those trash. If you beg for mercy right now and immediately cook my Egg-Fried Rice, I will forgive you. Otherwise\u2026 you can forget about continuing this business.\u201d\u201cThere are still three servings of Dry-Mixed Noodles and three servings of Stir-Fried Vegetables.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re asking for it!\u201dZhao Ruge was truly angry. He took a step forward and true energy gushed out from his hand as he reached toward Bu Fang. He was confident that an ordinary person would not be able to dodge his attack.Bu Fang calmly stood still as he watched the approaching Zhao Ruge. Before Zhao Ruge even reached him, a whistling wind coming from his palm made Bu Fang\u2019s long hair flap in the wind.Fatty Jin narrowed his eyes and his aura suddenly changed. The tip of his toes pushed against the ground and his body actually floated into the air. He wanted to stop Zhao Ruge.\u201cWhitey,\u201d Bu Fang softly called.Fatty Jin\u2019s eyes suddenly widened as a white and metallic puppet appeared in front of Bu Fang.Zhao Ruge\u2019s palm mercilessly slapped onto the metallic puppet\u2019s body but nothing happened.Zhao Ruge was stunned and Fatty Jin was bewildered as well.\u201cTroublemakers, you will be stripped as an example to others!\u201dWhitey\u2019s metallic pupils blinked for a while, then the visions of both Zhao Ruge and Fatty Jin blurred and they felt as if they were flying in the air.\u201cBang!\u201dZhao Ruge was the first one to be thrown out of the store and fell face first into the mud. He felt a chilly feeling all over his body and discovered all if his clothes were missing, leaving only a loincloth to cover his crotch.He angrily lifted up his head and looked toward the store. However, the expression on his face quickly turned into horror, because he saw a pile of\u2026 white flesh flying out from the store and was wriggling in the air as it headed toward him.\u201cBoom!\u201d The entire ground slightly shook.Fatty Jin felt wronged. He was not trying to cause trouble and only wanted to help.After heavily landing on the ground, Fatty Jin nudged his body as he felt as if there was something underneath him. Immediately, a burst of deranged voice came from below, causing him to quickly get up.Zhao Ruge was having a nosebleed and his delicate and handsome face had become somewhat distorted.Bu Fang walked toward the entrance of the store with his arms folded across his chest as Whitey stood behind him with a metallic sheen.\u201cToday\u2019s opening hours has ended, please come back tomorrow. Please pay your bill, the total amount is thirty-four crystals and eight-hundred gold coins.\u201dBu Fang indifferently said as he glanced at one of the obese men.That man shuddered and quickly paid the bill, then the entire group got out of the store.Zhao Ruge quickly left after making a threat with a furious look on his face. However, after looking at his white and naked behind, the believability of his threat was basically zero.\u201cHaha! Your store is interesting, we\u2019ll come back tomorrow!\u201d As Fatty Jin recalled that savory taste of the Egg-Fried Rice, he laughed out loud. Then he swaggered away with his group of buddies as the fat on their bodies jiggled with every step.The big black dog lying at the entrance snorted, rolled it eyes and went back to sleep. Bu Fang glanced at the back of the group of obese men, then expressionlessly closed up the restaurant for the day.When Bu Fang got back to his room, he estimated his progression on the mission. Within seven days, he had to make a profit of a hundred crystals and a thousand gold coins. The gold currency part of the mission was fulfilled, so he only needed to get around fifty crystals, which represented five servings of improved Egg-Fried Rice.\u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any problems, if that group of obese men comes tomorrow,\u201d Bu Fang muttered.\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cEh? Isn\u2019t that the son of the Minister of the Left, young master Zhao Ruge? Is he taking up nude streaking as well? His buttocks sure is white!\u201d the vegetable seller muttered.\u201cHe\u2019s truly the son of the Minister of the Left. That white butt of his is even prettier than a woman\u2019s butt!\u201d the shaobing seller muttered.\u201cIs nude streaking the latest trend in the imperial city? Why don\u2019t we do it some other day as well?\u201d the blacksmith said in a loud voice.\u2026\u201cBu Fang! If I don\u2019t destroy you and your little store, my name isn\u2019t Zhao Ruge!\u201d Zhao Ruge, who was covering his body with a basket, angrily roared with tears in his eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After feeding Egg-Fried Rice to the big black dog that was living a pig\u2019s life, Bu Fang was curled up on a chair as usual and his life carried on as always.Fatty Jin and his buddies were completely taken captive after eating Bu Fang\u2019s Egg-Fried Rice the previous day and their minds were completely filled with the delicious food in Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store. For someone like Fatty Jin, the amount of a bowl of Egg-Fried Rice was far too little and was completely unable to satisfy his appetite.After he arrived home, he ordered his chef to cook a basin\u2019s worth of Egg-Fried Rice. However, compared to Bu Fang\u2019s Egg-Fried Rice, the taste of the Egg-Fried Rice cooked by his chef, that he especially hired from Jiangnan, was simply too terrible. After taking a bite, he found it difficult to continue eating.The color, smell, and taste were on a completely different level than the Egg-Fried Rice of Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store.After enduring an entire night of hunger, Fatty Jin and his buddies ferociously headed toward Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store the next day. People not in the know might even think that they were going there to look for a fight.\u201cOwner Bu, good morning!\u201d When Fatty Jin arrived at the alleyway, he was delighted to find that Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store had already opened for business.Bu Fang recognized the obese man. There was no one else with that body size and belly in the entire imperial city.Bu Fang expressionlessly nodded at them and said, \u201cAre you here to eat? What are you ordering?\u201d\u201cOwner Bu, you have very little dishes here, but the taste of your food is wonderful. I was so hungry last night that I couldn\u2019t sleep at all. I simply could not wait to eat your Egg-Fried Rice, that\u2019s why I brought my buddies here to eat this early.\u201d Fatty Jin was grinning as he naturally walked into the store.The corner of Bu Fang\u2019s mouth widened to reveal an awkward smile. He was obviously happy when someone praised his food.\u201cHowever, Owner Bu, I have an advice for you. You could try making a breakfast menu. See, you\u2019re open so early and yet, you\u2019re only selling oily food. It\u2019s a waste of the morning period. Of course, your Egg-Fried Rice is not oily at all!\u201dBu Fang thought for a while, then nodded his head and simply said, \u201cThere will be in the future, wait for it.\u201dFatty Jin smile as he sat down on a chair and said, \u201cOwner, I want a serving of every dish. I am so hungry that I can\u2019t stand it.\u201dBu Fang gently answered with a \u201chmm\u201d then turned to the rest of the obese men. They naturally ordered all of the dishes like Fatty Jin.When it came to these obese men, Bu Fang was not worried at all that they would waste any food. The only possible worry would be there was not enough for them to eat.\u201cAlright, please wait,\u201d After noting their orders, Bu Fang entered the kitchen.Be it starting the fire or turning on the stove, everything was done quickly and proficiently.With a burst of fire and a tilt of the frying pan, a spatula was used to scoop out the Egg-Fried Rice. The egg fluid, which was eighty percent cooked, enveloped every single plump rice grain. As it was carried out of the kitchen, the rich fragrance triggered a barrage of rumbling within the stomachs of the obese men.When Bu Fang brought out the second serving of Egg-Fried Rice, Fatty Jin was already licking the bowl. When he saw Bu Fang, he quickly put down the bowl, gave a thumbs up and said, \u201cOwner Bu, this taste is the best! It is the most delicious Egg-Fried Rice that I\u2019ve ever eaten in my entire life! And I can\u2019t believe that this Egg-Fried Rice actually stimulates the true energy within my body. No wonder it costs ten crystals! I\u2019ll have another serving!\u201d\u201cI am sorry, every customer can only order each dish once per day,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly replied.\u201cOwner Bu, money isn\u2019t an issue, I don\u2019t mind paying more! Give me another serving, this little amount is completely unable to fill my stomach,\u201d Fatty Jin shly said. He really did not care about money at all.Compared to delicious food, money did not matter!\u201cNo, these are the rules,\u201d Bu Fang coldly said. Then he turned around and entered the kitchen, ignoring the depressed Fatty Jin.When all the orders were completed, Bu Fang was massaging his slightly aching shoulders as he walked out of the kitchen.Fatty Jin and his buddies had already contentedly finished their food. They greeted Bu Fang one after another and he expressionlessly nodded back at them.\u201cThe total is fifty five crystals and a thousand gold coins.\u201d\u201cSsss\u2026\u201dEven though these obese men did not lack money, they still sucked in a breath of cold air when they heard the price. Only this group of nouveau riche could spend so much money in a single meal.\u201cI will treat you guys today. Let\u2019s patronize Owner Bu\u2019s business more often in the future. We can\u2019t let this delicious dishes be neglected!\u201d Fatty Jin was extremely generous as he waved his arm and footed the bill.\u201cPlease come again next time.\u201d Bu Fang watched as the group of satiated obese men left with an awkward smile appeared on his face.\u201cMy host, congratulations for completing the mission: a profit of a hundred crystals and a thousand gold coins within a week,\u201d the system\u2019s solemn voice sounded out in Bu Fang\u2019s mind, causing his calm heart to become slightly happy. He thought, \u201cI finally completed the mission.\u201dHowever, there was very little change in his expression. Even though the system had already distributed the reward, he did not check them as it was still within opening hours.Outside the store, a tall and slim figure slowly approached.\u201cOwner Bu, good afternoon. Give me a serving of improved Egg-Fried Rice.\u201d the third prince, Ji Chengxue, said with a smile, then found a seat and sat down.Bu Fang nodded and said, \u201cPlease wait a moment.\u201dThe group of obese men had eaten all the way from morning until the afternoon.Just when Bu Fang was cooking the Egg-Fried Rice in the kitchen, another two figures appeared outside the entrance.\u201cYour Highness is here as well?\u201d Xiao Xiaolong was pleasantly surprised by Ji Chengxue, who was already inside Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store. Beside Xiao Xiaolong was the slim Xiao Yanyu, who was wearing a veil.The energy that Xiao Yanyu emitted was even more powerful than before and bright lights were periodically flashing on her jade-like skin.\u201cYanyu\u2019s cultivation level has once again improved, as expected of the monstrous genius that could compete with the son of the \u2018Marquis that Protects the Country\u2019.\u201d Ji Chengxue gently smiled.Xiao Yanyu faced Ji Chengxue and slightly curtsied, \u201cThe young \u2018Marquis that Protects the Country\u2019 is amazingly talented and had reached the peak of fourth grade Battle-Spirit at the age of fifteen. How could I compete with him? Your Highness is far too kind.\u201d\u201cHaha, are you here to eat? Owner Bu\u2019s culinary skills is truly unparalleled, I feel that he\u2019s far better than the imperial chef,\u201d Ji Chengxue said with a laugh.Bu Fang walked out of the kitchen, in his hands was a blue and white porcelain bowl with the glowing Egg-Fried Rice. The rich aroma spread across the room, causing Ji Chengxue and the rest to be intoxicated.\u201cHere\u2019s your improved version of Egg-Fried Rice, please enjoy your meal,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly said.\u201cOwner Bu, do you have alcohol here? If this delicious Egg-Fried Rice is matched with good wine, then it would be perfect!\u201d Ji Chengxue earnestly looked at Bu Fang and suggested.\u201cWine?\u201d Bu Fang paused for a moment, then he nodded.\u201cThere will be in the future, wait for it.\u201d\u201cOwner Bu, give me two servings of improved Egg-Fried Rice and two servings of Stir-Fried Vegetables,\u201d Xiao Xiaolong excitedly said.\u201cPlease wait a moment,\u201d Bu Fang turned around to return to the kitchen. When he reached the entrance, he suddenly turned around and said, \u201cSissy, don\u2019t you want Dry-Mixed Noodles as well? I heard that Dry-Mixed Noodles is more compatible with a sissy.\u201dXiao Xiaolong expressionlessly looked at Bu Fang. If he had a knife on him, he would have unhesitatingly slashed at Bu Fang.Xiao Yanyu and Ji Chengxue immediately laughed and was grinning from ear to ear. They did not realize that the cold and strict Owner Bu was so humorous.Bu Fang was slightly confused. He was just talking about a fact. Xiao Xiaolong came a few times and only ordered a bowl of Dry-Mixed Noodles, but every time he would cheerfully finish it. The two were definitely compatible. Ignoring them, Bu Fang entered the kitchen.After the three of them finished their meals, they paid their bills and parted ways with Bu Fang. They left Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store with satisfied smiles on their faces.It was the favorite scene of every chef to see their customers leave with a satisfied smile on their faces. Even someone as cold as Bu Fang was not an exception.After cleaning up the tableware, there was only half an hour left before Fang Fang Little Store\u2019s opening hours was over.Bu Fang stretched his body and yawned, then curled up on the chair and leaned against the doorway. He planned to spend the last half an hour in relaxation.The scorching sun was gradually moving and its rays were turning gentler. The shadows of buildings in the alleyway started to lengthen like a classical oil painting.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBu Fang was starting to fall asleep.\u201cDa da da!\u201dJust then, a series of footsteps sobered him up.A petite figure wearing a floral dress swiftly rushed into the store. She was leaning against the wall as she breathed heavily while bending over.Bu Fang expressionlessly looked at the person in front of him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Her tender skin was as white as snow and her large eyes were sparkling. Her exquisite and adorable face, while her delicate full lips were glossy pink.The little loli patted that flat chest of hers and caught her breath. When she carefully peeked out of the entrance and realized that no one had caught up with her, she finally breathed a sigh of relief. That was when she realized that Bu Fang was staring at her. She immediately glared at him and said, \u201cWhat are you looking at? Haven\u2019t you seen a beauty before!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re just a flat-chested loli,\u201d Bu Fang simply retorted and stood up from his chair.Bu Fang was 1.8 metres tall and was looking down at the little loli from high up above. The little loli had to raise her head to look at Bu Fang.\u201cWould you like something to eat?\u201d Bu Fang asked. There was less than half an hour left until the opening hours was over. He originally thought that there would not be any customers and did not expect a little loli would appear out of nowhere.\u201cWho are you calling flat-chested!\u201d The little loli was pouting as she fumingly stared at Bu Fang and said, \u201cIt\u2019s just that I haven\u2019t gone through puberty yet!\u201dBu Fang expressionlessly glanced at the little loli\u2019s flat chest and the corner of his mouth widened\u2026When the little loli saw the expression on his face, she almost went into a rage.\u201cIf you\u2019re ordering, then hurry up.

He was someone aiming to become the God of Cooking, he had no time to waste on this little loli.And so, Bu Fang patted the little loli on her head, then picked her up and headed toward the entrance of the store. As he walked, he said to her, \u201cGood girl, you should go home and play.\u201dThe little loli, who was being carried by Bu Fang, immediately struggled as her adorable little face contorted with fury.\u201cYou lecher, let go of me!\u201dShe did not want to leave. Her father\u2019s guards were still looking for her and if she went outside, she would immediately be caught.\u201cI will order something, I will order!\u201d The little loli\u2019s eyes did a little turn and she said in a tender voice.Bu Fang was stunned for a moment, then he placed her down.The little loli knitted her eyebrows and angrily snorted, then quickly went back to her seat and said, \u201cGive me the most expensive dish!\u201d\u201cNo, your cultivation level does not meet the requirement,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly said.The little loli was startled as she thought, \u201cWhat kind of a store is this, why does my cultivation level need to be checked just to eat a meal!\u201d\u201cThen give me a serving of Egg-Fried Rice then,\u201d the little loli twitched her mouth and helplessly said.\u201cPlease wait a moment.\u201d Bu Fang glanced at the little loli, then he went into the kitchen.The little loli was bored to death as she waited.

She thought, \u201cIt\u2019s really delicious!\u201d\u201cThat would be one crystal, thank you,\u201d Bu Fang stared at the little loli from high up above.The little loli blinked her adorable eyes as she looked at Bu Fang. Suddenly, her eyes turned wet and her rosy little mouth pouted. She pitifully said to Bu Fang, \u201cBig brother, I ran away from home and I didn\u2019t bring any money with me. Since I am so cute, could you not charge me?\u201dBu Fang expressionlessly thought, \u201cOh, so this loli is a freeloader.

No matter what, the brat was still a girl. Even though she had no breasts, it would not be a good idea to strip her.The little loli was already frightened to death and both of her legs were trembling. She thought, \u201cThis is definitely a criminal\u2019s den! There\u2019s actually a terrifying thing here that wants to strip someone as cute as me!\u201d\u201cThere are two punishments: one, the offender will be stripped as an example to others; two, the offender will pay the debt with their body.\u201d The system solemnly replied.\u201cPay the debt with their body? There\u2019s actually such a method?\u201d Bu Fang raised his eyebrows and glanced at the flat chest of the little loli, then he sighed and shook his head,\u201cThe so called \u2018pay the debt with their body\u2019 means they will work as a waiter in the store for a week.\u201d The system solemnly corrected the immoral thoughts in Bu Fang\u2019s mind.Without even skipping a heartbeat, Bu Fang lightly coughed.\u201cSince you don\u2019t have any money to pay the bill, then you\u2019ll need to work here for a week. Your main job will be serving dishes to the customers,\u201d Bu Fang said.The little loli was stunned for a moment, then happily nodded her head and said, \u201cAlright!\u201dThis time, it was Bu Fang\u2019s turn to be surprised. He thought, \u201cWhy would you readily agree, shouldn\u2019t you refuse?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not getting any pay!\u201d Bu Fang reminded her, only for the little loli to roll her eyes in response.And so, the little loli that ran away from home stayed at Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store and became a waitress.Once the opening hours was over, Bu Fang closed up the store and went upstairs.The little loli, that ran away from home and had nowhere to stay, was placed in one of the other rooms. This was only because she begged and disturbed Bu Fang for quite a while before he finally agreed.\u2026\u2026\u201cMy host, congratulations for completing a short term mission, you shall soon receive the system reward.

As a chef, he was familiar with cooking fish and knew that it was an excellent ingredient.Different types of fish could be used to produce different gourmet food.\u201cFish Tri-Cooking is the three methods to cook fish: Lees Fish, Boiled Fish, and Fish Head Tofu Soup. The system will provide fresh ingredients for the host. Based on your current true energy level, freshwater and saltwater fish of the third grade are available. As your true energy level increases, the grade of the fish provided will increase as well,\u201d the solemn voice of the system resounded in Bu Fang\u2019s mind.He was stunned for a moment as he did not think that Fish Tri-Cooking was referring to three methods of cooking fish. Bu Fang was not a stranger to these cooking methods either and had once eaten the authentic Lees Fish at Poyang Lake on Earth.However, the key to making Lees Fish was the alcohol. An extremely strong and mellow wine must be used. Only then would the aroma of the wine permeate into the fish during the marinating process. Normally, a quality plate of Lees Fish would be covered with pale pink distillers grains with a rich alcoholic aroma and the meat of fish would have an enticing jujube-like red color.\u201cThe alcohol is the key to making the dish, but would the system be providing it?\u201d Bu Fang thought.\u201cFor the Lees Fish cooking method, the best rice wine distillers grains will be provided everyday. However, the host has to manually marinate the fish,\u201d the system said.Bu Fang nodded. Since the system was going to provide the rice wine distillers grains, there would not be any issue with cooking the Lees Fish.Bu Fang was very familiar with both the Boiled Fish and the Fish Head Tofu Soup. Boiled Fish was a very popular dish on Earth that hawkers would be selling on the streets until nightfall.On the other hand, Fish Head Tofu Soup was an unusual home-cooked dish. However, cooking the dish was still not an issue for Bu Fang.\u201cThe host has completed the short term mission. The current earnings of a hundred crystal converted to true energy is equivalent to ten crystals, the true energy level has been increased to Battle-Master. My host, congratulations for increasing your true energy level! You have taken another step to become the God of Cooking! Work hard, young man!\u201d the system solemnly said.The system\u2019s announcement made Bu Fang rejoice as he quickly called out the character panel.Host: Bu FangTrue Energy Cultivation Level: Second Grade (As the God of Cooking in the fantasy world, you will definitely need to make use of true energy when cooking. Work hard, young man.)Cooking Talents: Yet to be unlockedSkills: Yet to be unlockedTools: Yet to be unlockedGod of Cooking overall rating: Beginner (Your cultivation level is finally on the right track. Work hard, young man.)System Level: Two Stars (Conversion ratio is at twenty percent, obtained permission to release furnitures, customers are allowed to bring ingredients lower than third grade.)Bu Fang heavily breathed out. He lifted up his hand and his body started to glow, as if an invisible energy was circulating in it.A second grade Battle-Master could not manifest true energy outside of their body but it was perceptible when circulating within the body. As the circulation of true energy within his body continued, Bu Fang felt more and more energetic as his fatigue gradually disappeared; there was even black impurities being expelled from his body.If this scene was witnessed by others, they would definitely be shocked. Bu Fang was experiencing a metamorphosis: a process that would only appear when a person became a fourth grade Battle-Spirit.When Bu Fang touched his chest and felt the bulging muscles, a stiff smile appeared on his face. As a chef, a strong physique was necessary. Even though the system only increased his true energy level and did not impart any combat skills to him, it was more than enough.It was because the system was designed to create a chef and not a fighter. With the help of the system, his goal was to become the God of Cooking.The stench of the impurities expelled from his body made Bu Fang frown in displeasure and he went to take a shower.After freshening up, Bu Fang changed into a new set of clothes and entered the kitchen. He could not wait to try out the the new techniques that he learned.A wine vat had mysteriously appeared in the corner of the kitchen, causing Bu Fang to raise his eyebrows in surprise. He quickly realized that it was probably prepared by the system for cooking the Lees Fish.In order to cook the Lees Fish, there were high requirements for the alcohol. As Bu Fang unsealed the cloth cover of the wine vat, a burst of thick wine aroma gushed out. Bu Fang wrinkled his nose as a slight redness appeared on his face.\u201cWhat a rich wine aroma!\u201dBu Fang looked into the wine vat and saw the surface was evenly covered with a layer of tan distillers grains dipped in a smooth and aromatic wine. Using a bamboo ladle to scoop up the distillers grains, Bu Fang brought it to his nose and sniffed. He detected a faint sour smell with a hint of sweetness. When he rubbed a little of distillers grains between his fingers, it felt soft and sticky. Without any doubt, it was an excellent vat of distillers grains. Both the grains and the resulting wine were high quality.\u201cAs expected of the system, the quality of the product is the finest!\u201dAfter Bu Fang resealed the wine vat, his gaze landed on the fish tank in another corner of the kitchen with two fishes lazily swimming around in it.Bu Fang had never seen these species of fish before. He was certain that they did not exist on Earth. One of the fishes had a faint blue glow surrounding its body; its eyes were moving about in a lively manner and had a perfectly shaped body. The other fish was far more menacing; it had a bulging head and a pitch-black body with reflective scales.Bu Fang expressionlessly stood in front of the fish tank with his sleeves rolled back and stared at the two fishes. Suddenly, both of his hands moved and swiftly entered the water. In the moment ripples appeared on the water\u2019s surface, he had already caught the glowing fish in his hands. The reaction of the fish was quick as well as it suddenly emitted a shockwave from its body to escape from Bu Fang\u2019s hands.After all, it was not an ordinary fish but a third grade spirit beast. Even though it was weak at fighting, it was still capable of struggling.Bu Fang seemed like an experienced fisherman as his fingers tightly grasped around the body of the fish and it gradually stopped struggling. The fish was eventually scooped out of the water and placed on the chopping board.The kitchen was renovated and prepared by the system, so all sorts of kitchenware were available. Bu Fang randomly grabbed a kitchen knife; the knife glimmered menacingly but did not affect his movements.\u201cThe third grade Ice Sea Fish is a type of seawater fish caught in the northeastern waters of the Light Wind Empire. Its body radiates a blue glow, the meat contains cold energy and is also filled with spirit energy. It is an excellent ingredient.\u201dThe rating that the system gave to the blue-glow fish was not low, since the system would not provide any poor ingredients to Bu Fang in the first place. It was natural since having good ingredients was a necessity for cooking gourmet food. There would be a world of difference in the taste if poor ingredients were provided.Guiding true energy to his palms, Bu Fang used the flat side of the knife to smack the fish on its head. The fish, that was still struggling moments ago, suddenly became still.Bu Fang proficiently handled the descaling and gutting of the fish. In a while, an Ice Sea Fish was successfully processed. He walked to the wine vat and opened it. After stuffing the belly of the fish with distillers grains, he shoved the entire fish into the wine vat to marinate it.\u201cThe special wine vat can speed up the marinating process. Estimated time to finish is three hours,\u201d the system announced.Bu Fang was startled, then nodded his head. If the marinating process could be hastened, then he would be able to sell it by the time his store opened for business.After placing the Ice Sea Fish into the wine vat, Bu Fang began to prepare the second dish.The number of fishes in the tank became two once more. Without him even noticing, the system had already replenished the stock of fishes to ensure that Bu Fang would always have access to his ingredients.This time Bu Fang scooped out the black and stout fish. After processing it, he cut off its head and started to cook the Fish Head Tofu Soup.From the refrigerator, Bu Fang took out a pearly white tofu and began to cook.\u201cThird grade Thunder Silver Carp is a type of freshwater fish caught in the Southern Wasteland Great Lakes of the Light Wind Empire. It has a hefty head and plenty of flesh; the fish tastes refreshing with a slight prickling sensation. It is an excellent ingredient.\u201d\u201cIce-crystal Jadeite Tofu is made using the Exquisite Spirit Energy Soybeans from the northern parts of the Light Wind Empire. It is manually grinded and the manufacturing process is complicated. It is used as a royal tribute.\u201dAs both the fish and tofu were extraordinary, Bu Fang could not help but be filled with expectations for the fish-head tofu soup.As Bu Fang lifted up the lid, a rich fragrance with a faint scent of meat rushed out of the pot into his nasal cavities. He subconsciously deeply inhaled and triggered a series of rumbling noises from his stomach.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAt the same moment, the bored little loli staying in the guest room suddenly sniffed a few times. Her large and adorable eyes did a little turn and were filled with delight.\u201cWhat a nice smell! Could it be that deadpan owner is cooking something delicious? This smell\u2026 It\u2019s not Egg-Fried Rice!\u201d This little girl had a very good sense of smell. She quickly got off the bed and rushed out of the guest room.Back in the kitchen, Bu Fang had just scooped out of the fish-head tofu soup from the pot.With just the milky white soup, a fat and tender fish head, and pearly white tofu, it was the most primitive combination of fish head and tofu.The aromatic and appetizing Fish Head Tofu Soup was then placed onto the table.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The rich fragrance converged at the top of the bowl and exuded a captivating radiance under the dim lighting.Bu Fang satisfactorily took a deep breath as the faint fragrance of the fish rushed through his nasal cavities and spread into his limbs. The Fish Head Tofu Soup was actually a slightly difficult home-cooked dish as it tested a chef\u2019s control over heat. However, with Bu Fang\u2019s culinary skills, that was naturally quite accomplished.That was the only way to produce the pristine, milky-white fish soup.After bringing the blue and white porcelain bowl out of the kitchen and placing it on a table in the store, Bu Fang took out a smaller bowl and was ready to personally taste the delicious Fish Head Tofu Soup.\u201cMy dear boss, what did you cook? It smells so good!\u201d Just when Bu Fang was about to start eating, a small head popped out from behind the door. Her charming, large eyes were staring at the bowl of Fish Head Tofu Soup in front of him.Bu Fang was startled for a moment, then he expressionlessly glanced at the little loli. He almost forgot about her, but he was not surprised that she would be attracted by the smell of the soup.\u201cI am trying out a new dish,\u201d Bu Fang simply said.Just as he finished the sentence, the little loli was already standing in front of him. She was licking her lips while her eyes were staring at the bowl without blinking.\u201cA new dish? It looks delicious. Is this fish soup? Why is the soup milky-white?\u201cEh? This tofu is beautiful. It looks just like a piece of artwork. How did it retain such an appearance after cooking?\u201cWow! This fish head has a lot of meat! It looks delicious!\u201d\u2026\u2026Bu Fang put down his bowl and chopsticks, and looked at the babbling little loli. He awkwardly sighed and said, \u201cGo and get a bowl and chopsticks, we\u2019ll eat it together.\u201dThe little loli\u2019s eyes immediately lit up, and a gleeful smile appeared on her chubby face. \u201cBoss, you\u2019re the best!\u201dAnd so, the little loli ran into the kitchen, then quickly returned with a porcelain bowl in hand and was impatiently staring at Bu Fang.The corner of Bu Fang\u2019s mouth widened into an awkward smile. He took over the bowl in her hand and filled half of it with fish soup. Then he added a piece of fat, tender fish meat and two pieces of crystal-clear tofu into the bowl.The little loli happily received the bowl. She brought it close to her nose and inhaled; she could not help but delightfully yell out from the warm fragrance.The little loli seemed to be quite knowledgeable about eating. She did not immediately eat the fish meat, but lifted the bowl and drank the soup instead. The milky white soup passed through her tender lips and into her mouth. The slight viscosity caused the soup to feel as smooth as silk. The rich taste was released in her mouth and completely enveloped her taste buds while the refreshing taste completely relaxed her entire body.\u201cD\u2026 Delicious! It smells so good!\u201d The little loli satisfactorily sipped from the bowl; her large eyes were squinting like two crescent moons. She had a satisfied expression on her face, as if she could drink from this bowl for the rest of her life.\u201cDon\u2019t just drink the soup, you should try the fish meat as well. You might be surprised,\u201d Bu Fang simply said. He gently looked on as the little loli drunk the soup.Bu Fang picked up his own bowl of soup and started to drink as well. The taste was indeed savory and the freshness of the ingredients was fully exhibited.\u201cAh! This fish\u2026 Why is there a prickling sensation!\u201d After eating a piece of fish, the little loli was taken aback. Even though eating the fish meat gave her a prickling sensation, it did not lower her rating of the dish but increased it. The prickling sensation came from the ingredient itself, and when combined with the refreshing taste, its richness was increased and made the taste more apparent.The tofu was extremely soft as well and melted in her mouth. The faint taste of the tofu mixed with the residual taste of the fish gave her a peculiar pleasure.\u201cThis is the most delicious soup I\u2019ve ever tasted!\u201d The little loli earnestly said toward Bu Fang after she finished the last drop of soup. It was not only delicious, but also improved her true energy circulation and a warm feeling was spreading throughout her body.\u201cHmm, I see. Sleep early if you\u2019ve finished eating. There\u2019s still work tomorrow,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly nodded and reminded her.The little loli\u2019s facial expression froze, then she haughtily snorted. She put down the bowl in her hands and was about to return to her room. However, she hesitated for a moment when she reached the door, then turned toward Bu Fang and said, \u201cSmelly boss, my name is Ouyang Xiaoyi. You can call me Xiaoyi.\u201dBu Fang was startled and said, \u201cHmm, I see.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe little loli was annoyed. She thought, \u201cI\u2019ve already told him my name, shouldn\u2019t this smelly boss tell me his name?\u201d\u201cSmelly boss, what\u2019s your name?\u201d Xiaoyi haughtily asked.\u201cBu Fang,\u201d Bu Fang simply replied as he tidied up the tableware. Xiaoyi snorted and finally satisfactorily went back to sleep.After placing the tableware in the automatic dishwasher, Bu Fang stretched his body and intended to have an early rest. Even though his body was stronger, it was still important to have a good rest.Since Bu Fang had already eaten the Fish Head Tofu Soup and his mouth still retained the delicious taste of the dish, he had no intention of cooking his other reward, the Golden Shumai, for the moment.The night passed without any incident.When the morning sunlight touched the entrance of the store, Bu Fang had already completed his daily training and opened the store.Ouyang Xiaoyi was rubbing her eyes as she came down the stairs. She spotted Bu Fang feeding the big black dog at the entrance and curiously went up to him. When she saw that the big black dog was eating the Egg-Fried Rice that she ate yesterday, she was completely bewildered.Bu Fang glanced at her and expressionlessly said, \u201cI forgot to tell you something yesterday. Since you\u2019re repaying your debt by working here, your meals won\u2019t be provided. If you\u2019re eating here, then you\u2019ll still need to pay.\u201dWhen the little loli heard him, she forced herself to look away from the big black dog and immediately used a pitiful gaze to look at him.However, Bu Fang was completely unaffected.\u201cFine\u2026\u201d The little loli gave up and viciously laid a curse on Bu Fang so he would not be able to find a wife.Bu Fang was leisurely curled up on the chair and basking in the warm sunlight, while Ouyang Xiaoyi was bitterly sitting nearby. The scene was still quite\u2026 harmonious.Finally, Fatty Jin and his buddies arrived and familiarly greeted Bu Fang.\u201cGood morning, Owner Bu! The weather is good today.\u201d A smile appeared on Fatty Jin\u2019s face.Bu Fang nodded and lightly replied with a \u201chmm\u201d. Then he got up and entered the kitchen, \u201cIf you\u2019re ordering anything, tell it to that girl. Oh, and there\u2019s a new dish today. Do you want to give it a try?\u201d\u201cOh my! What a cute little girl. Owner Bu, you have such a unique preference!\u201d Fatty Jin teasingly laughed at him and looked toward Ouyang Xiaoyi. However, the smile on his face soon disappeared and his cheeks slightly trembled.\u201cOh my god! Why is she here! Damn it!\u201dFatty Jin blinked furiously and looked at the little loli. \u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026 It really is her! Owner Bu is truly formidable, how did he get her to be his waitress\u2026 Did those three barbaric brothers of her agree to this?\u201dOuyang Xiaoyi recognized him as well. She immediately snorted and impatiently said, \u201cFatty Jin, what are you ordering? Hurry up.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll have the improved Egg-Fried Rice and the new dish today,\u201d Fatty Jin hurriedly said. The other obese men also ordered their dishes as well. However, they did not order as much as yesterday. After all, the dishes were not cheap.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAlright, wait for it.\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi seriously memorized their orders and headed toward the kitchen. Once she reached the entrance, she reported their orders to Bu Fang.\u201cHmm? Only Fatty Jin ordered the Fish Head Tofu Soup?\u201d Bu Fang was slightly surprised, but it was within his expectations.After all, the price of the Fish Head Tofu Soup was not cheap: twenty crystals per serving. It was exorbitant.Only someone with money like Fatty Jin would dare to freely order this dish. Even though the others were rich as well, their wealth could not be compared with his.\u201cFish Head Tofu Soup, how interesting. For it to be sold for twenty crystals, I am looking forward to it!\u201d Fatty Jin was filled with expectations as he sat on the chair.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Which was why Bu Fang was preparing Fish Head Tofu Soup and Egg-Fried Rice at the same time.There was a window between the kitchen and the dining area, which seemed to have been just created by the system. Bu Fang placed the Egg-Fried Rice that was finished at the window and called out for the little loli.\u201cThis is the improved Egg-Fried Rice, serve it to the customer,\u201d Bu Fang simply said. Then he ignored the bewildered loli and returned to the kitchen.\u201cHe\u2019s really\u2026 telling me to serve the customers?!\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s eyes widened and her face was filled with surprise. With her status, no one would dare to let her perform any heavy work, let alone make her serve dishes like a maidservant.The little loli looked in Bu Fang\u2019s direction while scrunching her nose, then haughtily snorted.With both of her hands holding the bowl, she could smell the rich fragrance of the Egg-Fried RIce. The little loli, who had not eaten breakfast yet, was feeling hungry from the smell.\u201cWhy does it smell so good!\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi was going crazy. It was almost like the golden Egg-Fried Rice was radiating boundless temptation as it continuously stimulated her appetite.\u201cWorking as a waitress here is simply inhumane!\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi muttered in her heart. She placed the Egg-Fried Rice in front of Fatty Jin and angrily snorted. \u201cHow dare this fatty make me serve him!\u201dWhen Fatty Jin saw that Ouyang Xiaoyi was actually serving the dish herself, he immediately got up to receive her with an overwhelmed expression.Ouyang Xiaoyi ignored him and quickly returned after placing the Egg-Fried Rice down. She was afraid that she would not be able to endure the temptation and eat the dish herself.As Bu Fang was placing another bowl of Egg-Fried Rice at the window, he was stunned when he saw the Ouyang Xiaoyi who was returning.Ouyang Xiaoyi had tied a handkerchief over her head with the knot covering her nostrils and looked like a thief.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly asked.\u201cSmelly boss! Do you know how difficult it is for a waitress to resist the temptation?!\u201d The little loli said as she exasperatedly rolled her eyes at Bu Fang.Bu Fang\u2019s mouth widened, but he was not smiling.After around fifteen minutes, the Fish Head Tofu Soup was finally ready. The rich fragrance immediately drifted out of the kitchen and engulfed the entire store.Fatty Jin was eating Egg-Fried Rice when he suddenly paused. He raised his head and sniffed the air, as if he wanted to inhale all of the fragrance in the air into his nose.\u201cIt smells really good! It doesn\u2019t smell like Egg-Fried Rice! Could this be the smell of the new dish!\u201d Fatty Jin muttered to himself. Then his eyes lit up as he expectantly looked toward the kitchen.The bowl that was used to serve the Fish Head Tofu Soup was comparatively larger, so Bu Fang did not let the little loli serve the dish. Instead, he slowly walked out of the kitchen with the bowl in his hand.He was attracting everyone\u2019s attention as he stepped out. They were curiously looking at the gigantic bowl in his hands while Fatty Jin was feeling slightly antsy.\u201cHurry! Hurry!\u201d Fatty Jin could barely control his urge to taste the dish and was impatiently staring at Bu Fang, who was leisurely moving toward him.A bowl of Fish Head Tofu Soup was placed in front of Fatty Jin, containing: milky-white fish soup; fat, tender, crystal-clear fish meat; and jade-like tofu. A rich fragrance was emanating from it.\u201cHere\u2019s your Fish Head Tofu Soup, please enjoy your meal,\u201d Bu Fang simply said.Everyone woke up from their stupor as they gathered around Fatty Jin while clamoring, pushing aside Bu Fang and Xiaoyi with their huge bodies.Bu Fang did not mind and he expressionlessly went to curl up on his chair by the entrance. On the other hand, Ouyang Xiaoyi was infuriated. \u201cThis group of fatties! How dare they push me aside!\u201dShe clenched her teeth and stared at the group of obese men for a while, feeling helpless as well. Then she angrily snorted and gave up.Gulp!The group of obese men were making gulping noises as they enviously watched Fatty Jin devour the Fish Head Tofu Soup with a look of happiness on his face.\u201cOld Jin, is this Fish Head Tofu Soup really that good?!\u201d One of the obese man curiously asked. His appetite was already extremely worked up by the smell.Fatty Jin spit out a fishbone from his mouth. With an enjoyable expression while squinting his eyes, he replied, \u201cThis fish soup is simply indescribably delicious. It\u2019s difficult to imagine that it\u2019s a fish soup cooked with tofu. The fish meat is fat and tender; the hardness is just right and it felt like going through a massage when I bit down. The tofu is even more incredible, it completely disappeared the moment it entered my mouth! Oh and there was a prickling sensation when eating the fish meat; it should be the meat of a thunder-type spirit beast. I even felt an increase in spirit energy when I ate it. In summary, this bowl of fish soup is definitely worth it!\u201dFatty Jin\u2019s incessant praises immediately satisfied the curiosity of this group of rich men. Finally, the obese man who asked the question seemed to have come to a decision. He turned toward Bu Fang and said, \u201cOwner Bu, I want to order Fish Head Tofu Soup!\u201dBu Fang lazily lifted his head and looked at the obese man, then he expressionlessly said, \u201cNo, your cultivation level is too low, so you can\u2019t order it.\u201dThe obese man was dumbfounded, and anxiously said, \u201cShop owner, I have money! I really have money!\u201d\u201cIf your cultivation level doesn\u2019t meet the requirement, you can\u2019t order it. This is the rule, it has nothing to do with money,\u201d Bu Fang simply said. He gave off an extremely cold aura, as if he had no interest in money at all. However, the truth was Bu Fang was suffering inside\u2026It was twenty crystals! Every single crystal was hard-earned money!Bu Fang\u2019s stern rejection did not surprise the others. They did not continue to ask Bu Fang as they were well aware that Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store regarded its rules very highly.Fatty Jin was very pleased. After happily paying his bill, he waved toward Bu Fang and was about to leave. However, before he could do that, he was stopped by the little loli and both of them whispered together for a while.Then, the little loli came back with a smile on her face, as if she had just found money on the floor.\u201cSmelly boss, give me Egg-Fried Rice and Fish Head Tofu Soup!\u201d the little loli charmingly shouted at Bu Fang as she stepped near the kitchen.Bu Fang raised his eyebrows and simply said, \u201cAre you trying to freeload again?\u201d\u201cI have money! Hurry up and cook for me!\u201d the little loli haughtily implored in a whiny tone.\u201cYour cultivation level is not high enough, you can\u2019t order Fish Head Tofu Soup.\u201d Bu Fang stood up. If the little loli had money, then it was not a problem. From what he saw just now, she probably borrowed money from Fatty Jin.\u201cYou liar! I already drank Fish Head Tofu Soup yesterday!\u201d The little loli unhappily retorted. She thought that Bu Fang was deliberately making things difficult for her.Bu Fang paused for a moment, then replied, \u201cThere\u2019s no restriction when tasting a new dish. Didn\u2019t you notice that your true energy didn\u2019t increase at all even though you ate so much yesterday? I already removed the spirit energy within the dish, so that was why you could eat it.\u201dActually, the spirit energy within the fish soup was removed by the system. Since his cultivation level was too low and it would be dangerous to taste the dishes as it was, the system would remove the spirit energy when tasting any new dishes. Bu Fang only needed to sample the taste and texture of the dishes.The little loli was at a loss for words. She noticed that Fatty Jin\u2019s true energy had really increased by a large amount after eating the Fish Head Tofu Soup, so the restriction was probably real.\u201cThen\u2026 then give me a bowl of Egg-Fried Rice,\u201d The little loli felt wronged as she miserably replied.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cOh, give me a moment,\u201d Bu Fang simply said and returned to the kitchen.After Bu Fang entered the kitchen, three figures appeared at the entrance of the store. One of them was the elegant third prince, Ji Chengxue, while the other two were the good-looking Xiao siblings.When the three of them entered the store, they were immediately stunned when they saw the pouting loli sitting on a chair.\u201cXiaoyi? What are you doing here? Old General Ouyang has been crazily looking for you! The entire imperial city has almost been thrown into chaos!\u201d Xiao Yanyu dismayingly shouted when she saw the little loli.It was only then that Ouyang Xiaoyi noticed the three of them. When she turned around and saw them, her expression immediately changed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She wanted to escape the moment she realized the situation.However, her opponent was Xiao Yanyu, the number one female prodigy in the imperial city and a fourth grade Battle-Spirit genius. Xiao Yanyu appeared beside the little loli, as if she had just teleported, and grabbed her by the clothes.\u201cAh! Elder sister Yanyu, what a coincidence.\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi blinked. When she realized that she could not escape, she looked at the frosty-looking Xiao Yanyu with an innocent expression.Xiao Yanyu exasperatedly tapped the little loli on her head. \u201cYou brat, you\u2019ve really grown! Where did you learn to run away from home! Do you realize how anxious your grandpa is?!\u201dXiao Xiaolong and Ji Chengxue approached them with smiles on their faces. Xiao Xiaolong was even winking at Ouyang Xiaoyi. \u201cHeh, the entire imperial city has been almost thrown into turmoil by the old general because of this little brat, but the culprit has actually been hiding here enjoying delicious food. I wonder if Old General Ouyang would vomit blood if he found out about this?\u201d\u201cXiaoyi, be a good girl. The old general was only thinking of you. You should go back. It\u2019s not good for the elderly to get angry.\u201d Ji Chengxue, dressed entirely in white, gently gazed at the loli.Ouyang Xiaoyi grievously scratched her head and retorted, \u201cI am not going back. Grandpa has been forcing me to practice martial arts everyday, when my tiny limbs aren\u2019t suitable for fighting. Besides, look how cute I am, isn\u2019t it a waste for me to practice martial arts?\u201dXiao Yanyu was immediately tickled by what Ouyang Xiaoyi said; the both of them had gotten along since they were young, so she was familiar with her temperament.\u201cThe Light Wind Empire is a martial country. Your grandfather, Old General Ouyang, came from a military background and served the Emperor during the expeditions. He naturally holds a higher regard for martial arts and wants his descendants to inherit the essence of his martial arts. Do you how many people in the entire empire desire to study under your grandfather? You\u2019re the only one who doesn\u2019t understand how lucky you are.\u201dOuyang Xiaoyi still felt wronged. She clamped her mouth shut and indignantly turned her face to the other side.When they saw this, Ji Chengxue and Xiao Xiaolong immediately laughed. They were worried when they heard that she left home but now they could finally relax.The third prince, Ji Chengxue, patted Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s head and solemnly said, \u201cXiaoyi, you should go home. There\u2019s a lot of experts from the Sects hanging around in the imperial city these days. It\u2019s not the time for you to be unruly. If you were to be abducted by one of them, it would be a huge handicap for your grandfather.\u201dOuyang Xiaoyi was still a little afraid of the elegant Ji Chengxue, so she blinked and grievously nodded.At that moment, Bu Fang had already finished cooking the Egg-Fried Rice. After placing it at the window, his voice coldly sounded out, \u201cGirl, your Egg-Fried Rice is ready.\u201d\u201cAh! I am coming!\u201d Hearing that her Egg-Fried Rice was ready, Ouyang Xiaoyi immediately brightened up. She excitedly jumped up and swiftly ran toward the window.Placing the aromatic bowl of Egg-Fried Rice on a table, the starving Ouyang Xiaoyi ignored the others and began to devour the food in front of her.\u201cThis brat\u2026 I can\u2019t believe she managed to find this place.\u201d Xiao Xiaolong had a gentle expression on his face as he watched Ouyang Xiaoyi gorge herself.\u201cOwner Bu, give me the improved Egg-Fried Rice,\u201d The third prince refinedly shouted toward the kitchen.\u201cLook for that girl if you\u2019re ordering,\u201d Bu Fang replied without leaving the kitchen.Ji Chengxue, Xiao Xiaolong and Xiao Yanyu were all stunned.The little loli, who was busily eating, was startled. She lifted her face, which had a few grains of rice, and adorably said, \u201cI am currently the waitress here. If you\u2019re ordering anything, just tell me.\u201d\u201cYou? The waitress?\u201d Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s eyes widened as he looked at Ouyang Xiaoyi with a weird expression on his face. \u201cOwner Bu is fearsome indeed! He actually dared to hire this brat as a waitress, is he not afraid of that three barbarians from Ouyang family?\u201dXiao Yanyu knitted her eyebrows and said, \u201cXiaoyi, it\u2019s not easy for Owner Bu to run a business. Don\u2019t cause trouble for others.\u201dJi Chengxue seriously nodded as well.Ouyang Xiaoyi expressionlessly looked at the three of them, she was tempted to spit out the rice in her mouth at them. What did they mean by causing trouble for others? Was she that\u2026 fearsome?!It was clearly that smelly boss\u2019 fault for threatening her and making her pay the debt with her body.Swallowing the Egg-Fried Rice in her mouth, Ouyang Xiaoyi snorted and said, \u201cHurry up and tell me if you\u2019re ordering! I don\u2019t have the time to waste on you.\u201dAt that moment, the three of them finally acknowledged the fact that Owner Bu had really made Ouyang Xiaoyi into a waitress. They were impressed with Bu Fang\u2019s courage as well. Everyone knew that the young mistress from Ouyang family was the number one troublemaker in the imperial city and creating trouble was one of her habits.\u201cEh? There\u2019s a new dish?\u201d Xiao Xiaolong gleefully exclaimed with widened eyes, when he saw the new dish on the menu.Xiao Yanyu and Ji Chengxue\u2019s attentions were attracted as well. It was not a trivial matter for Owner Bu to produce a new dish.\u201cLees Fish and Fish Head Tofu Soup?\u201d Xiao Xiaolong read it out loud. Then his eyes squinted and the edge of his mouth was twitching. \u201cLees Fish and Fish Head Tofu Soup each costs twenty crystals per serving\u2026 Owner Bu\u2019s dishes are expensive as usual.\u201d\u201cThe Fish Head Tofu Soup is really delicious! I tried it last night! It tastes really good! It\u2019s the best soup I\u2019ve ever had! It\u2019s even better than the fatty uncle\u2019s \u2018Colored-Glass Seven-Stars Fish Soup\u2019!\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi said as her eyes lit up.Xiao Yanyu was astonished. The fatty uncle that Ouyang Xiaoyi mentioned was none other than the head chef in the imperial palace. Could this fish soup really compete with the fatty uncle\u2019s signature dish?\u201cI am really looking forward to it. Since Xiaoyi said that, then I\u2019ll give it a try\u2026 Give me Lees Fish.\u201d Ji Chengxue elegantly smiled with squinted eyes.Ouyang Xiaoyi expressionlessly looked at him. What happened to the bond between people?\u201cThen I\u2019ll order Fish Head Tofu Soup,\u201d Xiao Yanyu softly said. Her voice was still as beautiful as the song of birds.\u201cI\u2026 I will still get the improved Egg-Fried Rice.\u201d Xiao Xiaolong was in agony\u2026 He did not foresee that Bu Fang would bring out a new dish, so he did not bring additional crystals with him and the store did not allow customers to have unpaid tabs either.\u201cAlright, wait for it.\u201d The little loli seriously memorized the orders of the trio, then headed toward the kitchen window and reported to Bu Fang.\u201cAlright, I see.\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly nodded, then turned around to prepare the ingredients.\u201cSomeone ordered the Lees Fish?\u201d Bu Fang was slightly looking forward to it as well.He walked toward the wine vat and unsealed the cloth cover. A rich fragrance immediately rushed out and a slight redness appeared on his face from the intoxicating smell.Taking out the third grade Ice Sea Fish, he saw its pale blue meat was dyed pink from the marinating process. the Ice Sea Fish was completely covered in the rich and thick distillers grains.Bu Fang removed the distillers grains from the exterior of the Ice Sea Fish, then placed it on the cutting board and made a few superficial cuts on it with a kitchen knife; their purpose was to fully maximize the taste of the fish meat during the steaming process.He carefully placed the Ice Sea Fish on a plate, then placed it in a bamboo steamer and started steaming.The entire process required around ten minutes, so Bu Fang already started to prepare the Fish Head Tofu Soup. After preparing the dish a few times he was already very familiar with cooking it and his efficient movements were filled with beauty.While the Fish Head Tofu Soup was simmering Bu Fang began to cook the Egg-Fried Rice. The amount of time it took was short, so he quickly finished it.Ouyang Xiaoyi once again used that unique style of hers to serve the dish and the corner of Bu Fang\u2019s mouth only widened. At that moment, a rich fragrance was already drifting out from the bamboo steamer. The fragrance was the smell of fish mixed with the aroma of wine, which was especially enticing.When Ji Chengxue noticed the fragrance, his eyes immediately lit up as martial artists were naturally wine lovers. From the especially strong aroma coming from the wine, he knew that it was definitely a good wine. He began to salivate and was looking forward to it even more.When the ten minutes countdown was up, Bu Fang lifted the cover of the bamboo steamer. Steam rose up from within and rushed out of the steamer; it was refreshing and slightly sweet. The water used in the steamer was rich in life energy because it was obtained from a dragon lake, that was said to be home to a seventh grade Drake, within the Dragon Spring Mountains.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBu Fang carried out the Lees Fish and placed it on a table.After the marinating and steaming process, the blue skin of the Ice Sea Fish had turned into pinkish-red; the skin was crystal-clear like jade and looked as if was twinkling. Light pink distillers grains were spilling from the cut at its stomach, and the soup from the steaming process was both mellow and thick. The fish meat that was cut was split open during the steaming process, revealing the sparkling grease as it flowed out.Bu Fang himself was swallowing his saliva while blushing red from the rich wine aroma.Bu Fang did not let Ouyang Xiaoyi serve the dish. Since it was a new dish, he wanted to do it himself.As he walked out of the kitchen, a rich wine aroma was emanating from the mouth of the Lees Fish and enveloped the entire store.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The aroma of the wine was so rich and mellow that it was comparable to the \u201cExquisitely Aromatic Intense Flames Wine\u201d from the imperial palace.As the Lees Fish was being served, everyone within the store turned to look at it. Even the little loli was curiously stretching her neck to see what it looked like, even though she firmly believed that the Lees Fish was not as delicious as the Fish Head Tofu Soup.\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful\u2026\u201d Xiao Yanyu softly exclaimed when she saw the glowing Ice Sea fish, that radiated a faint pink glow. Her eyes were instantly attracted by the dish.Due to the way it was cooked, the skin of the fish was compact and springy. The distillers grains were spilling out from its stomach, emanating aroma and heat. From its mouth, a dense wine aroma was gushing out, making it seem as if the fish was swimming in the ocean.\u201cHere\u2019s your Lees Fish, please enjoy your meal,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly said.Ji Chengxue gently smiled as he impatiently picked up the chopsticks. However, even though he was eager to taste it, his movements were still methodical. He used the chopsticks to test the tightness of the fish\u2019s skin, and the resulting resistance made him smile.Only a chef that was able to precisely control the heat would be able to cook the fish so that the skin would have such springiness. If the fish was steamed for too short, the skin would harden and the meat would become coarse. If the fish was steamed for too long, the skin would become sticky and the meat would turn into a syrup state.With a slight push, the chopsticks pierced through the skin and penetrated the fish; a clear fish oil seeped out, accompanied by a rich fragrance.He picked up a piece of fish near the gills; it was the most delicious part of the entire fish and had the highest quality. Most adepts at eating fish would choose this part.Ji Chengxue\u2019s eyes lit up as the piece of fish entered his mouth. He felt as if he was not eating fish, but drinking a glass of wine; a wine aroma gushed out of the piece of fish and enveloped his mouth, but it was the fresh and tender piece of fish that was enclosing his taste buds instead.The fish tasted refreshing and contained a slight coolness; the mixture of hot and cold created a contrasting effect and gave it a surprisingly good taste.Ji Chengxue closed his eyes as he enjoyed the taste. He nodded as an intoxicated expression appeared on his face. Then he continued to pick up a large piece of fish and put it into his mouth.\u201cOwner Bu, this isn\u2019t an ordinary fish, right? That slight coolness was really vital; it brought the taste of the fish that was already delicious to the next level.\u201d Ji Chengxue said as he ate.The others unconsciously swallowed their salivas are they watched the rapid movements of his chopsticks. Even the loli was staring at the Lees Fish, thinking that it looked really delicious\u2026\u201cThe fish used is the third grade Ice Sea fish from the northern water regions of the Light Wind Empire. The fish itself is extremely cold, but the coldness would reduce significantly after cooking. When combined with the heat from the distillers grains, the hot and cold would mix together and create a contrasting effect.\u201d Bu Fang mildly explained to Ji Chengxue, then he returned to the kitchen. The Fish Head Tofu Soup was still cooking; he did not want to ruin the dish.Ji Chengxue suddenly realized why the taste was familiar. The Ice Sea Fish was a rare spirit beast, and even a prince like him could only rarely taste it. He did not think that he would be able to eat it in a secluded store within the imperial city.\u201cEveryone, give it a try. This fish is really delicious, and the taste of the distillers grains is extremely mellow as well. This dish is definitely worth the price,\u201d Ji Chengxue said with a smile when he noticed that everyone was staring at him.Xiao Xiaolong unreservedly picked up a piece of fish with his chopsticks and put it into his mouth. On the other hand, Xiao Yanyu was far more reserved; she waited until Xiao Xiaolong was done before she elegantly picked one up herself.Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s eyes widened as he breathed out a mouthful of hot air filled with the aroma of wine. The fish was so delicious that it exceeded his expectations; he thought the mixture of hot and cold caused by the fish and the distillers grains was ingenious.\u201cDelicious!\u201d Xiao Xiaolong was intoxicated.The little loli swallowed her saliva and covertly reached out her chopsticks to pick up a piece of fish. However, she was intercepted by a smiling Ji Chengxue, while innocently pointing at the words on the menu.Ouyang Xiaoyi was immediately enraged. She was only a second grade Battle-Master; she was not allowed to eat the dish!Xiao Yanyu\u2019s image was far better than Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s, but her eyes lit up as well and she nodded.Soon, a piece of Lees Fish was carved up by them. They all had faces filled with enjoyment, but it quickly changed into intoxicated expressions when Bu Fang took out the Fish Head Tofu Soup.With a different cooking method from the Lees Fish, it let the three of them experience a feast of fish. Even though there were only two dishes, they felt as if it was already the ultimate pinnacle of cooking fish.Ouyang Xiaoyi was pouting while feeling depressed. It was the first time she felt that her grandfather\u2019s insistence that she should practice martial arts was a correct decision. If she had put in more effort and became a third grade Battle-Maniac, then she would have been able to taste the dishes.\u201cThank you for your patronage, the total is fifty crystals,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly said, reporting out their check.After having their fill, they experienced the ultimate pain. Fifty crystals\u2026 That was more than what some lower level cultivators spend in an entire month.\u201cOwner Bu\u2026 your dishes are really expensive.\u201d Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s mouth was twitching.\u201cBut it\u2019s worth the price, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Bu Fang simply said as he expressionlessly looked at him.\u201cFine, you\u2019re the shop owner. Your words make the most sense\u2026\u201d Xiao Xiaolong did not retort. He was only grumbling. As the son of a general, the price was still bearable.The three of them left. While they were leaving, they tried to bring Ouyang Xiaoyi along with them, but were stopped by Bu Fang.\u201cHer working hours hasn\u2019t ended yet, so she can\u2019t leave. She can go home after opening hours is over,\u201d Bu Fang simply said.Xiao Yanyu and the others looked at Bu Fang with an odd expression, but they did not insist and left.The little loli\u2019s face was filled with resentment as she sat on a chair. Her chin was resting on her hands, as if she was contemplating about life.\u201cSmelly boss, your dishes are really delicious, but why do you need to have a cultivation level restriction? I can\u2019t eat anything with my level\u2026 Are you trying to make me put in effort and cultivate?\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi grumbled.\u201cGood ingredients can be used to produce delicious tastes. The higher the grade of an ingredient, the greater the amount of spirit energy; the taste will also be even more delicious.\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly explained, \u201cHowever, with a greater amount of spirit energy in the ingredients, a lower leveled cultivator will die if they consume it.\u201d\u201cHmph! I will properly cultivate when I go back. One day, I will eat all of the dishes in your store,\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi laughing said and then stuck out her tongue at Bu Fang.\u201cOh, you\u2019re welcome to do that. However, you\u2019ll still need to pay for your meal,\u201d Bu Fang earnestly said.Ouyang Xiaoyi was speechless.After Ji Chengxue and the others left, Xiao Yanyu decided to inform Old General Ouyang about Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s location after much deliberation.When Old General Ouyang got the news, he was dumbfounded. \u201cWhy would this brat become a waitress in a remote restaurant when she ran away from home?\u201d\u201cThe three of you\u2026 Go to that whatever store and bring your sister back! That brat, if I don\u2019t teach her a lesson this time, she might one day climb onto the emperor\u2019s head to pull his beard!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSitting high above, the stern-looking Old General Ouyang ordered the bear-like three siblings below.\u201cYes!\u201d The three siblings gave a muffled reply, then turned around and rushed out of the manor.It was not a trivial matter for the three barbarians of Ouyang to move out together. Quite a number of interested parties were paying attention, but they were speechless when they found out that the the barbarians were only going to pick up their sister from a little restaurant.Such a high-profile useless action truly tallied with the Ouyang family\u2019s style.The current Bu Fang did not know that three humanoid beasts were fiercely heading his way. And he was just curled up on his chair\u2026 basking in the sun.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They had large backs and thick waists, resembling humanoid beasts. With their terrifying combat prowess and superior strength, they were considered humanoid destroyers within the imperial city and given the nickname of the three barbarians of Ouyang.The eldest was Ouyang Zhen, the second was Ouyang Wu, and the youngest was Ouyang Di. When their given names were combined, it formed \u201creally invincible\u201d. The three of them were triplets, so their appearances were quite similar. Their cultivation levels were around the same, at fourth grade Battle-Spirit. They once followed their father, General Ouyang Zongheng, out to the battlefield and were experienced with bloodshed.Even though they were called the three barbarians of Ouyang and showed no respect to anyone within the imperial city, they were extremely obedient towards their only sister, Ouyang Xiaoyi. When they heard that their delicate and dainty sister was actually being confined within a little restaurant, they were enraged by the news.As the three of them furiously headed for the restaurant, they were like a volcano that was about to erupt.Zhao Ruge and Sun Qixiang, who were secretly monitoring the little restaurant, immediately noticed their movements and were gloating about it. Zhao Ruge was even sneering incessantly; he had always wanted to find a chance to take revenge, but now he did not even need to do anything.The three barbarians of Ouyang were called humanoid destroyers for a reason. Destruction followed everywhere they went. When the opportune time came, he would only need to step on that god damned deadpan shop owner\u2019s face.If you followed the main road of the imperial city and walked past the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant, then turned left after walking for a few dozen meters, you would find an alleyway. If you stepped inside, you would find Bu Fang\u2019s little store.Bu Fang was curled up on his chair as he basked in the sun. The warm sunlight shining on him made him feel warm and sleepy.Ouyang Xiaoyi was sitting nearby, bored. Since she was bored and wanted to quickly eat the Lees Fish and Fish Head Tofu Soup, she began to diligently cultivate.As the three barbarians of Ouyang stepped into the alleyway, their auras directly spread out and created a strong wind that stirred the dust around them.Boom boom boom!The three of them were like wild beasts. Every single step they took made the ground quiver.\u201cBig brother! That little restaurant in front of us is the one responsible for confining our little sister! Let\u2019s go and kill its audacious owner!\u201d Ouyang Wu said with a deep voice as he angrily glared.Ouyang Di patted his chest and his beard fluttered as he roared, \u201cDamn it! How dare he confine our precious little sister! I swear that if we don\u2019t tear him down by today, I will abstain from wine for three days!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go and see who would dare to do this.\u201d Ouyang Zhen was the most levelheaded among the three. However, since it involved his sister, he was still more agitated than usual. As he recalled his little sister\u2019s adorable voice and appearance, and imagined how she might be suffering from unbearable torture at that very moment, he felt as if his heart was being torn to pieces.The big black dog lying on the ground suddenly felt a series of tremor. It immediately opened its weary eyes and looked towards the three huge figures ferociously coming its way. It opened its mouth and yawned, then resumed its sleep.Bu Fang was also woken up by the tremor. He puzzledly looked up and saw the three barbarians of Ouyang standing outside.\u201cWho are you people? Are you here to eat?\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly asked.\u201cBah! You fraud, who would want to eat here! We\u2019re here for our little sister!\u201d Immediately, Ouyang Wu\u2014who had the worst temper\u2014angrily shouted.Bu Fang went into a daze, thinking, \u201cLooking for your little sister? These three guys who look exactly like Zhang Fei[1] must be mistaken. We\u2019re a decent restaurant, not a brothel.\u201d\u201cWhat little sister, we don\u2019t have any here.\u201d Since they were not there to eat, Bu Fang could not be bothered. He continued to curl up on his chair.\u201cHow dare you try to trick us! I can feel my little sister\u2019s aura, right within your restaurant! If you don\u2019t hand her over, we\u2019ll level this little restaurant!\u201dOuyang Di cracked his knuckles and made bone creaking sounds, as he maliciously looked at Bu Fang.Bu Fang expressionlessly glanced at the three of them. He finally realized who they were looking for: it was that little loli, Ouyang Xiaoyi.Bu Fang stood up and shouted towards Ouyang Xiaoyi who was cultivating nearby, \u201cHey brat, someone is looking for you.\u201dBu Fang\u2019s shout interrupted Ouyang Xiaoyi and work her up from the cultivation state. She surlily glared at Bu Fang, then she looked out of the store. She quickly noticed that her monster-like brothers were standing outside.Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s expression immediately changed. She knew that it was definitely Xiao Yanyu who revealed her location.\u201cSmelly boss! They are my brothers and they are here to bring me home. Help me stop them\u2026\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi whispered, then she ran towards her room and disappeared.Bu Fang blinked as he expressionlessly looked in Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s direction, and was filled with doubt.He once again glanced at the three men standing outside.He thought, \u201cThe cute and adorable Ouyang Xiaoyi and three ugly and burly savages\u2026 Are they really from the same gene pool? They have the same parents, but why do they look so different?\u201d\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to see you,\u201d Bu Fang honestly said.\u201cWhat?! Are you trying to stop us? Damn it! How dare you confine my sister!\u201d Ouyang Zhen was furious. His mind was filled with images of his little sister being tortured.Unforgivable!Boom!The enraged Ouyang Di took a step first\u2014creating a blast of wind\u2014and appeared in front of Bu Fang; his hideous face was only inches away from Bu Fang\u2019s face. The wind was blowing Bu Fang\u2019s hair, causing it to flutter.Bu Fang expressionlessly asked, \u201cAre you trying to cause trouble?\u201d\u201cSo what if I am? I even want to tear down your store!\u201d Ouyang Di loudly said as he angrily glared.\u201cWhitey, someone\u2019s causing trouble,\u201d Bu Fang calmly shouted.\u201cTroublemaker, you will be stripped as an example to others,\u201d A mechanical voice sounded out, then Whitey\u2019s gigantic body appeared behind Bu Fang; its mechanical eyes were blinking.Ouyang Di\u2019s eyes narrowed as he grinned and said, \u201cYou even have helpers! Brothers, let\u2019s get him together!\u201dOuyang Wu and Ouyang Zhen appeared behind Ouyang Di, and their auras surged forward like a stormy sea as it continuously assaulted the little store.With their auras, an ordinary building would have already collapsed from the impact. However, Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store was completely unaffected.\u201cInteresting, there\u2019s really something strange with this store!\u201d The oldest brother thought.Ouyang Zhen knitted his eyebrows as he glanced around his surroundings. Other than the slim, fair gigolo and that iron lump puppet, there was nothing else in the area\u2026 Oh, there was a big black dog sleeping at the entrance as well. His mind was filled with possibilities.\u201cIt looks just like an ordinary store? How would such a store dare to confine my little sister?\u201cCould it be\u2026 This shop owner is hiding his abilities?! Or is there an expert from the Sects hiding within the store?\u201dOuyang Zhen seriously looked at Bu Fang and became even more confused. Bu Fang was only a second grade Battle-Master, and was even weaker than his sister.Just as Ouyang Zhen was skeptically thinking about the situation.Bang! Bang!As two loud noises sounded out, two gigantic figures flew out and shamefully crashed into a wall.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOuyang Zhen was startled by the sound. When he turned toward its direction, his pupils constricted from what he saw.He witnessed his brothers\u2019 thrown figures deeply stuck within the walls of the alleyway\u2026\u201cSorry, big brother! It\u2019s all an accident! An accident!\u201d Ouyang Wu and Ouyang Di were coughing dust as they crawled out from the wall.What an embarrassing situation: two of the three barbarians of Ouyang were actually thrown out as if they were balls.[1] Zhang Fei was a general who served under Liu Bei during the three kingdoms period.

We were thrown out before we even knew it!\u201d Ouyang Di alertly looked at Whitey with wide eyes. He felt that the puppet was very powerful.\u201cHow could a puppet be this capable? Could it be that it was created by an expert of the Sects? But how is that possible when they were so easily destroyed by our troops?\u201d Ouyang Zhen thought.Bu Fang expressionlessly looked at the three humanoid beasts.

However, there won\u2019t be a next time.\u201d\u201cBig brother! Is this gigolo threatening us?!\u201d Ouyang Di asked, incredulous.Within the imperial city, no one dared to threaten the three barbarians of Ouyang. They might not be playboys, but they were more terrifying than them. Everywhere they went, silence followed. No one wanted to attract their attention.However, at that very moment, they actually met a reckless gigolo that dared to threaten them. Were the three barbarians of Ouyang the type of people that could be easily threatened by others?\u201cThe dignity of the three barbarians of Ouyang will not be violated!\u201d Ouyang Zhen fiercely said as he angrily glared.The corner of Ouyang Di\u2019s mouth curled up. \u201cThis is our big brother! This is our big brother that led us in our domination within the imperial city! We will not yield!\u201dHowever, Ouyang Zhen\u2019s next line almost made Ouyang Di vomit blood.Ouyang Zhen glanced at Whitey standing behind Bu Fang and said, \u201cYoung man, let\u2019s talk this over. If you hand over our little sister, we can forget about this.\u201dBu Fang expressionlessly replied, \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask your sister. She didn\u2019t pay after eating so she has to work off her debt. She needs to work here for a week and this is only the first day.\u201d\u201cWhat?! Our sister didn\u2019t pay for the food?\u201d The three barbarians of Ouyang were stunned, their mouths were wide open from surprise.Ouyang Wu replied, \u201cThen it\u2019s definitely because your food tastes bad. Otherwise, why wouldn\u2019t our sister pay up? Even though she\u2019s a little unruly and fierce, she\u2019s still reasonable.\u201dHis words instantly caused Bu Fang to frown. As a chef, he hated it when others criticized the taste of his food, because it was the greatest insult to him.\u201cSide mission started: Conquer the palates of the three barbarians of Ouyang. Their arrogance has already offended the immense pride of the host. Please use your invincible culinary skills to completely slap them in the face. The system will forever be your strongest backing. Mission reward: winemaking technique.\u201dThe arrogant and serious voice of the system that resounded in his mind startled Bu Fang. He did not expect that a side mission would start just like that, especially when there was a reward involved.\u201cHey, the three of you haven\u2019t even tasted my food. How can you say that my food tastes bad?\u201d For the sake of the mission, Bu Fang sternly and seriously asked.The three barbarians of Ouyang looked at each other, then Ouyang Zhen smirked and said, \u201cSo what if we say that your food tastes bad? What are you going to do about it?\u201dBu Fang\u2019s expression turned very cold; he was angry.The big black dog lying at the entrance lifted up its head and glanced at Bu Fang.

Let\u2019s have a wager. Come into my store and taste my dishes. If it really tastes bad, then you can take away your sister. If it tastes good, then you\u2019ll go home naked,\u201d Bu Fang coldly said.\u201cWager? Is this gigolo an idiot? If he can\u2019t even subdue our sister, what is he going to do with the three of us when we have bland taste buds?\u201d\u201cAlright! We accept, but you have to keep to your word! After all, gigolos like to go back on their word,\u201d Ouyang Zhen said.\u201cCome in and order first,\u201d Bu Fang indifferently said.The three barbarians of Ouyang looked at each other, then alertly stared at Whitey before entering the store. Once they came in, the three of them began to survey the surroundings.\u201cEven though the ambience isn\u2019t bad, isn\u2019t it way too small?\u201d Ouyang Di complained as he wiggled his body.For their humongous bodies to squeeze into the little store was indeed even more uncomfortable than Fatty Jin and his buddies, but it was still tolerable.\u201cOwner, do you have any wine? Give us an urn first,\u201d Ouyang Wu shouted as he banged the table. This fellow had already completely become a customer.\u201cI am sorry, but we don\u2019t provide wine,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly said.\u201cHow can a restaurant not have any wine? Are you kidding me! Forget it, I\u2019ll see what you have here,\u201d Ouyang Wu scornfully glanced at Bu Fang, then turned toward the menu on the wall.Then\u2026 It was as if time had stopped moving, and the store became extremely silent.\u201cThe Lees Fish costs twenty crystals? The Fish Head Tofu Soup is twenty crystals as well? A bowl of Egg-Fried Rice can be sold for ten crystals too?\u201d Ouyang Zhen was crude, but he was not an idiot. The price was\u2026 slightly scary.\u201cA plate of Stir-Fried Vegetables and a bowl of Dry-Mixed Noodles each costs a hundred gold coins\u2026\u201d Ouyang Wu was dumbfounded.\u201cNow I know why our little sister couldn\u2019t pay the bill, that\u2019s because this store is a scam!\u201d Ouyang Di angrily roared while banging the table.Bu Fang frowned and said, \u201cAre you going to order? Your sister is right within this store. If you win the wager, I\u2019ll let you take her back.\u201d\u201cHmph! For the sake of our sister, I\u2019ll do it even if it\u2019s a scam! I\u2019ll have Lees Fish!\u201d Ouyang Zhen declared.\u201cOwner, why are you not selling wine when you have distillers grains!\u201d Ouyang Wu unhappily asked with widened eyes.Bu Fang expressionlessly replied, \u201cThe distillers grains are for making Lees Fish, not for making wine.\u201dOuyang Wu was slightly confused. \u201cThis\u2026 What\u2019s the difference? You can make wine as long as you have distillers grains, right?\u201d\u201cThen give me Lees Fish as well!\u201d Ouyang Wu said.\u201cOur store has only one Lees Fish left, please order other dishes,\u201d Bu Fang simply said.\u201cAh! If it were not for my sister, I would just smash your store right this instant!\u201d Ouyang Wu was annoyed. He ordered the improved Egg-Fried Rice in the end.Ouyang Di did not say anything and only ordered Fish Head Tofu Soup.After the three of them finished ordering, Bu Fang nodded and said, \u201cPlease wait.\u201dThen, Bu Fang entered the kitchen and began to cook.\u2026\u2026Zhao Ruge was sitting on a sandalwood chair as he listened to his underling\u2019s report. Then with a faint smile on his face, he said, \u201cYou are saying that the three barbarians of Ouyang have entered the store?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIt looks like the store is not far from destruction. Even though the three barbarians are brainless idiots, their cultivation levels are quite high. Tearing down a little store shouldn\u2019t be an issue. Call up the others, we\u2019ll go and watch a good show.\u201d Zhao Ruge opened up his paper fan and elegantly smiled as he left the manor with his servants.Sun Qixiang had already received the report of his servants. His sesame-sized eyes narrowed as he coldly smirked. \u201cHow dare you sabotage my food with chilli and even make me nude streak in public. I\u2019d like to see how you\u2019re going to run your business after antagonizing the three barbarians of Ouyang.\u201dExcept for Zhao Ruge and Sun Qixiang, the rest of the people who received the news hurriedly headed for the little store with grim expressions. They all knew about the terror that were the three barbarians of Ouyang. Xiao Yanyu was even slightly upset. She did not think that Old General Ouyang would directly send them out. If something happened to Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store, then it would all be her fault.At that moment, a lot of people rushed towards Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store.They all assumed that Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store was going to be destroyed by the three barbarians of Ouyang\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

We\u2019re wagering with him, but we\u2019re the ones who decide whether it\u2019s delicious. Even if his dishes are really delicious, we can just say that it tastes bad and he can\u2019t do anything about it! At that time, he\u2019ll still need to obediently hand our sister over,\u201d Ouyang Di covertly whispered to the stern-looking Ouyang Zhen.Ouyang Zhen gave a sidelong glance to his third brother, then snorted and said, \u201cWith our taste buds, even the most delicious cuisine in the imperial palace tasted the same. Do you think we even tell whether it tastes good or not? Aren\u2019t you just talking crap?\u201d\u201cThat gigolo will definitely lose this wager,\u201d Ouyang Zhen triumphantly said as his beard fluttered.\u201cI knew Big brother is the smartest among us; you understood immediately. It\u2019s only because we drank too much and lost our sense of taste. Except for wine, everything tastes like plain water. It\u2019s really uncomfortable, though,\u201d Ouyang said with a sigh.\u201cSecond brother! Don\u2019t worry about it. After we pick up Xiaoyi, I\u2019ll let you drink the \u201cExquisitely Aromatic Intense Flames Wine\u201d that the emperor bestowed to me! It will definitely make you feel as if your entire body is on fire!\u201d Ouyang Zhen said as he patted Ouyang Wu\u2019s shoulders.\u201cHeh! Thank you, big brother! With our palate, only wine can satisfy us now!\u201d Ouyang Wu grinned.While the three of them were chatting, Bu Fang was already preparing the dishes in the kitchen.The Ice Sea fish needed to be marinated in advance when cooking Lees Fish, and he only prepared two fishes the night before. He already cooked one previously and was going to leave the other one for dinner. However, since someone else ordered the dish, he took it out to cook it.After removing the distillers grains from the exterior of the fish, Bu Fang made two small cuts on its body then placed it on a plate inside the bamboo steamer.The Egg-Fried Rice and Fish Head Tofu Soup were being prepared as well.The smell of the Egg-Fried Rice was very fragrant; it drifted out from the kitchen and enveloped the three barbarians of Ouyang like silk, causing them to continuously sniff.\u201cIt smells so good! It looks like this gigolo has some skills after all.\u201d Ouyang Di said with an intoxicated expression.The other two remained silent, but they did not think much of it. No matter how fragrant it was, there was no point; with their bland taste buds, everything tasted the same.As Ouyang Xiaoyi was not around, Bu Fang had to personally serve the Egg-Fried Rice. He placed it on the table and said, \u201cErm\u2026 Whoever\u2019s Egg-Fried Rice, please enjoy your meal.\u201dAs the three brothers looked similar to Zhang Fei, Bu Fang\u2014who suffered from mild face blindness\u2014was already having difficulty differentiating them.\u201cThis is mine.\u201d Ouyang Wu narrowed his eyes, got closer to the Egg-Fried Rice and deeply breathed in. The rich fragrance immediately filled his nasal cavity. He honestly thought it smelled really good.Ouyang Wu was unable to endure it any longer and scooped up a spoonful of Egg-Fried Rice into his mouth. As the silk-like egg liquid entered his mouth, it immediately solidified. When it mixed together with the pearl-like rice grains, it was like they were jumping around his mouth, giving him a peculiar feeling.\u201cGuru.\u201dAfter swallowing the Egg-Fried Rice in his mouth, Ouyang Wu\u2019s face turned expressionless. Even though the texture was excellent, it had no taste at all.Ouyang Zhen and Ouyang Di tried a bite as well, and they both frowned after trying.\u201cWhat the hell is this? There\u2019s no taste at all\u2026 Is this supposed to taste good?\u201d Ouyang Zhen pursed his lip together, then threw the spoon onto the table and complained.Bu Fang was startled, thinking. \u201cHow is this possible? How could the improved Egg-Fried Rice taste bad?\u201dThis was the first time he met a customer that improved Egg-Fried Rice was unable to subdue.Bu Fang smelled the fragrance of the Egg-Fried Rice in the air; it was so rich that it was as if a piece of silk was caressing his face. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any problems with the taste!\u201d\u201cIs it because their taste buds are unique?\u201d Bu Fang thought.\u201cGigolo, you should just quickly throw in the towel and return our sister. You will not be able to cook anything that can impress us,\u201d Ouyang Di gloatingly said with a smile.The fact that the three of them only ate a single bite each and did not finish the Egg-Fried Rice was greatly out of Bu Fang\u2019s expectations.Even the big black dog lying at the entrance lifted its head and interestedly watched the scene unfold in the little store.\u201cPlease wait.\u201d Bu Fang\u2019s expression was extremely grim. He felt that his culinary skills was being severely challenged.He returned to the kitchen and the Fish Head Tofu Soup was ready to be served. He carefully poured the soup into a blue and white porcelain bowl. The Lees Fish needed a few more minutes, so he served the fish soup first.\u201cHere\u2019s your Fish Head Tofu Soup, please enjoy your meal,\u201d Bu Fang solemnly said.The fragrance of the Fish Head Tofu Soup was not inferior to Egg-Fried Rice in the slightest. The refreshing smell of the fish mixed with the faint fragrance of the tofu was like a fluttering gauze touching their skin. The milky-white fish soup and crystal-clear tofu were giving off a faint radiance under the lighting.Just the appearance of the dish fascinated the three brothers, triggering their appetite. However, after they finished drinking the fish soup, they became expressionless, as if they had just drank a bowl of tasteless plain water.\u201cNo! Your fish soup doesn\u2019t taste good,\u201d The Ouyang brothers said in unison while shaking their head.\u201cInteresting.\u201d Bu Fang remained expressionless, but he was extremely serious at that moment. He meaningfully glanced at the three brothers and returned to the kitchen. He still had one more dish left and if it did not impress them, then it would only mean one thing.\u201cThere\u2019s definitely something wrong with their sense of taste.\u201dAs a chef, Bu Fang was confident of his own dishes. Even though the reactions of the three brothers surprised him, it did not affect his confidence in his culinary skills.Taking the Lees Fish out of the bamboo steamer, the rich wine aroma instantly gushed out and filled up the entire store.The triumphant Ouyang brothers sitting in the store suddenly stiffened, as if their souls had been taken.\u201cBi\u2026 Big brother! What a rich\u2026 wine aroma!\u201d Ouyang Di felt his mouth gone dry and his eyes widened like saucers. The moment the wine aroma had emerged, he was instantly captivated.Ouyang Wu and Ouyang Zhen were feeling exactly the same as he did. They felt as if they had ants in their pants, evoking their desire to drink wine.\u201cThis is definitely the smell of a good wine! Only the \u201cExquisitely Aromatic Intense Flames Wine\u201d from the imperial palace could compete with this! Could this store really have such a high grade wine?\u201d Ouyang Zhen continuously swallowed his saliva, as he impatiently waited.The three of them were staring at the kitchen entrance, when a slim figure emerged.Bu Fang was extremely serious as he slowly carried out the Lees Fish.However, three pairs of eyes\u2014that seemed as if they were looking at prey\u2014startled him. \u201cWhat the hell?!\u201d\u201cHere\u2019s your Lees Fish, please enjoy your meal.\u201d Bu Fang glanced at the three of them, then placed the Lees Fish on the table and solemnly said.\u201cHow is it Lees Fish? It\u2019s not wine?!\u201d The Ouyang brothers cried out in unison, revealing the disappointment in their voice.\u201cI already said that we don\u2019t serve wine,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly replied.\u201cGigolo, you\u2019ve already lost. You can\u2019t impress us without wine. You should just obediently hand over our sister,\u201d Ouyang Wu sighed and said while disappointedly looking at the Lees Fish.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou should try it first,\u201d Bu Fang calmly said with an adamant expression.At that moment, Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2014who had already run away to her room just now\u2014suddenly walked out of her room with a worried expression. \u201cAbandoning the smelly boss like this seems to be a little dishonorable\u2026 What if he got beaten up by my brothers?\u201dOuyang Xiaoyi was well aware of her brothers\u2019 temperament and was feeling slightly guilty.\u201cSmelly boss, you must hang on, you mustn\u2019t die before I get there,\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi prayed in her heart as she swiftly ran out of her room to the dining area.She covertly peeked into the dining area from behind the door, but the very first sight made her eyes open wide with amazement.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She saw that her three barbaric elder brothers were actually gobbling down the plate of Lees Fish.That was right!They were behaving exactly like when a normal person ate Bu Fang\u2019s Egg-Fried Rice. The look of happiness on their faces were giving Ouyang Xiaoyi goosebumps all over her arms.It was precisely because Ouyang Xiaoyi knew the situation that she was even more surprised and amazed. Even though she would agree that Bu Fang\u2019s dishes were extremely delicious, her brothers had a poor sense of taste. How could they be impressed by his dishes?\u201cOh! I know! The Lees Fish has a strong wine aroma\u2026 That\u2019s because the wine aroma from the distillers grains had completely permeated into the fish, causing the fish to taste like wine. That\u2019s why my brothers who can only taste wine were subdued!\u201dOuyang Xiaoyi\u2019s eyes lit up and she was completely sure her hypothesis was right.As Bu Fang watched the three of them gorging on the dish, a relieved expression finally appeared on his face. Sure enough\u2026 there was no one that could resist gourmet food.\u201cCongratulations, my host, for completing the side mission: Conquer the palates of the three barbarians of Ouyang. The reward will be dispensed later. Young man, you have advanced further on your road to becoming the God of Cooking. Work hard,\u201d The system\u2019s solemn voice sounded out in Bu Fang\u2019s mind.An awkward smile appeared on Bu Fang\u2019s face.It was the first time that the three barbarians of Ouyang experienced the taste of gourmet food, and it was the first time that they tasted food that could open up all the pores on their body. The fish was simply too delectable.It contained a trace of coolness that seeped into their minds, and mixed within the coolness was a rich wine aroma that radiated heat. The mixture of hot and cold harmonized with each other and instantly assaulted their almost necrotic sense of taste, as if a dead tree was coming back to life.They experienced a taste\u2026 a taste that they could never forget for the rest of their life.\u201cWhy is it all gone? How dare you rascals snatch your big brother\u2019s food!\u201d Ouyang Zhen was still in a daze when he realized that the entire fish was gone; the last piece of the fish was taken by Ouyang Di.The fish bone was snatched by Ouyang Wu and he was licking it while holding it in his hands.And so, an entire fish was picked clean by them.The three of them were reluctantly staring at the plate as they licked their lips and fingers, while trying to recall the wondrous feeling from awhile ago.\u201cHave you finished eating? I won the wager, right? Then the three of you need to admit that my dishes are delicious,\u201d Bu Fang indifferently and yet confidently said, as he expressionlessly looked at them.The three barbarians of Ouyang immediately froze, while silently cursing. They were caught up in the excitement just now and completely forgot about their wager with Bu Fang\u2026 It was really because the Lees Fish was too delicious, as if it was a dish specially created just for them.\u201cEhem\u2026 Gigolo, how should I say? Even though we finished the dish, but\u2026 Tsk, tsk, tsk. It\u2019s still no good, your fish wasn\u2019t delicious enough,\u201d Ouyang Zhen said as he licked his fingers.\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t delicious enough, then why are you licking your fingers with a satisfied expression?\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly thought.\u201cThat\u2019s right! Your dish tasted really ba\u2026 Uh, even though the taste was okay, it wasn\u2019t delicious enough!\u201d Ouyang Di\u2019s eyes did a little turn and he stiffly said.Ouyang Xiaoyi, who was hiding behind the door, covered her face with her hands from embarrassment. Only her foolish brothers would be able to tell a barefaced lie in such an obvious manner.\u201cThat\u2019s right! Gigolo, that\u2019s why you\u2019ve lost! Now hurry up and hand our sister over! Otherwise, we\u2019ll tear down your store!\u201d Ouyang Wu menacingly threatened as he banged the table. However, when he used his tongue to lick his lips, the menacing part became comedic.Bu Fang was still expressionlessly standing there. He knew that the three idiots were planning to go back on their word.\u201cWhitey, strip them. Take the adequate amount of crystals and throw them out,\u201d Bu Fang simply said. Then he collected the plates on the table and turned around to head back into the kitchen.However, when Bu Fang turned around, he immediately saw Ouyang Xiaoyi hiding behind the door. He was slightly startled, then expressionlessly walked by her and entered the kitchen.Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s eyes widened as she looked at the serene Bu Fang. She was confused by his reaction. Why was he not afraid of her brothers going berserk? Even they were afraid of themselves when they went berserk!However, in the next moment, the scene that unfolded in the store made her completely speechless.She saw that adorable white puppet\u2014with a potbelly\u2014throwing out her three brothers with a single slap each. During the instant they were thrown out, they were completely stripped naked with only a loincloth to cover their private parts.\u201cAh!\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi screamed as she quickly covered her eyes. \u201cHow filthy! That\u2019s simply too filthy! I didn\u2019t know Whitey was like this!\u201dOuyang Xiaoyi was stunned, but the three barbarians of Ouyang were even more stunned. They shivered as a gust of cold wind brushed against their bodies. The three brothers were looking at the iron puppet with fear in their eyes.\u201cMy god! Big brother, this fellow is really terrifying! We were stripped before we could even react!\u201d Ouyang Di was unnerved. During that instant, he felt as if he was facing his grandfather.Their grandfather was Old General Ouyang Qi, a sixth grade Battle-Emperor! Could an iron puppet from a little store actually have strength equivalent to a Battle-Emperor?\u201cGod damned dogs[1]! When did such a terrifying thing appear within the imperial city!\u201d Ouyang Zhen could not help but curse out loud.The big black dog lying at the entrance suddenly opened its eyes and instantly focused its sharp gaze on Ouyang Zhen.\u201cGod damned dogs? Do you have a grudge against dogs?\u201dOuyang Zhen\u2019s face immediately turned white. He felt a coercion\u2014so large that it felt unstoppable\u2014instantly pressing down upon him. Even that last piece of loincloth covering his private parts exploded and turned into dust.A dull sound sounded out\u2026Ouyang Zhen was sloppily kneeling on the ground with a lifeless look in his eyes, as if he had collapsed from exhaustion.Ouyang Wu and Ouyang Di were shocked by the sudden turn of events. They fearfully looked at the store, picked up their big brother and quickly retreated\u2026 The enemy was too strong for them; it was better to call for reinforcements.The three of them fled, leaving the floor full of dust.The big black dog disdainfully glanced at the direction they went, stretched out its tongue to lick its beautiful fur, then snorted and went back to sleep.Zhao Ruge and the rest were standing guard outside the alleyway, expectantly waiting for the three barbarians of Ouyang to tear down that abominable store. However, after waiting for some time, they discovered three naked figures miserably running out.Two of them had a loincloth covering their private parts so they were still okay, but what did the one in the middle do? Why was he the only one that was totally naked?Everyone was looking at each other, and saw the horror in the other\u2019s eyes.\u201cWhat the hell\u2026 Even the three barbarians of Ouyang were thrown out? How is that store so fearsome? Is he not afraid of the Ouyang family\u2019s retaliation?\u201d Sun Qixiang\u2019s tiny eyes widened as he exclaimed in astonishment.Zhao Ruge knitted his eyebrows and a serious expression appeared on his handsome face. He was not Sun Qixiang, he thought much further than that. It was only a little restaurant that opened in the alleyways of the imperial city, but was able to throw out the three barbarians of Ouyang who were within the imperial city. Was the puppet really that strong? Was the store really that simple?\u201cNo! This store definitely isn\u2019t simple! The current situation in the imperial city is unstable, and there are plenty of experts from the Sects hiding around\u2026 For a store that can defeat the three barbarians of Ouyang to suddenly appear, there\u2019s definitely something going on!\u201dZhao Ruge heavily breathed in, then slowly breathed out. As the son of the Minister of the Left, he thought more and saw more. He did not dare to underestimate this little store any more.\u201cGod damn it! That rascal escaped again! No, I must definitely take revenge! I will shut down this store!\u201d Sun Qixiang bellowed!Zhao Ruge glanced at him as his eyes slightly narrowed, and an enigmatic smile appeared on his face.The Xiao siblings and the third prince, Ji Chengxue, had arrived as well, and saw the Ouyang brothers nude streaking from a distance.\u201cLooks like we don\u2019t have to intervene after all. Owner Bu is really not an ordinary person.\u201d As Ji Chengxue watched the fleeing figure of the three barbarians of Ouyang, a gentle but pensive smile appeared on his face.As a female prodigy, Xiao Yanyu\u2019s thinking was deeper than ordinary people. Her eyebrows were knitted together for an instant, then quickly relaxed.They did not choose to enter Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store and turned back. Sun Qixiang and Zhao Ruge left as well; they did not dare to rashly take action without properly understanding the store.After washing the tableware, Bu Fang returned to the dining area. He petted Whitey\u2019s body and praised it. Then he started to get ready to close the shop for the day.\u201cSme\u2026 Smelly boss, I think I\u2019ll go back first. I am afraid that my grandfather might get angry and send troops to tear down this place.\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi carefully said. She was terrified of this smelly boss; he might just strip her for disagreeing with him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBu Fang was slightly startled, then nodded and said, \u201cToday\u2019s business hours is over, you can go back now. However, you need to come back tomorrow. You\u2019re free once you\u2019ve worked for seven days.\u201dOuyang Xiaoyi nodded and carefully left the store, then quickly ran back to the Ouyang manor.Bu Fang expressionlessly yawned and went back into the kitchen. He wanted to try the reward that he had just gotten and the dish he forgot to make the previous night\u2026 the golden shumai.\u2014[1] \u65e5\u4e86\u72d7 \u2013 The literal meaning of this phrase means \u201chave sex with a dog\u201d.

The streets were lively with people and bright lights could be seen throughout the city.The Ouyang manor was situated between the two main roads of the imperial city. It was one of the two manors located right outside of the imperial palace. The other was the Xiao manor.Within the great hall of the Ouyang manor, the three barbarians of Ouyang were toplessly kneeling on the ground with their heads lowered. They did not dare to lift their heads to look at the elderly man sitting above.Below the elderly man, there was a hairy middle-aged man helplessly standing there.\u201cAre you an idiot! You bastard, look at those three sons of yours! Running naked in public within the imperial city? Why did I even bother to raise an unfilial son like you? You\u2019re disgracing me even when you\u2019re this old! I\u2019ve completely lost all of my face thanks to the lot of you!\u201dThe elderly Ouyang was very furious and his voice could be heard throughout the Ouyang manor. He pointed at Ouyang Zongheng while scolding him and his saliva was spraying all over his son. His finger was even poking Ouyang Zongheng\u2019s forehead, causing him to stumble with each poke.Ouyang Zongheng, a general of the Light Wind Empire, could only hold back his anger while being scolded by his father. He dared to get angry but did not dare to show it. He could only vent out his frustrations on his disappointing sons.\u201cAre the three of you stupid? I told you to fetch Xiaoyi, not run naked in public! You\u2019ve really made me lose face! When you\u2019re outside, don\u2019t say that you\u2019re from Ouyang family!\u201d Ouyang Zongheng shouted.Running naked in public was an incident that had made them lose a lot of face. A few days ago, he was still laughing at that wily Minister of the Left because his son ran naked in public. And now, his sons did it as well and even went as a group. He had completely lost face in front of the other court officials.The three barbarians of Ouyang did not dare to say anything. With their father and grandfather still angry, anything they said would be wrong.Just when the tension within the great hall had reached its climax, a small head peeked in through the entrance and looked in. It was Ouyang Xiaoyi.\u201cGrandpa, dad\u2026 Xiaoyi has returned!\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi leaped out from behind the door with a smile on her face.When the elderly Ouyang saw Ouyang Xiaoyi, his expression immediately became gentle and kind. He walked towards her and said, \u201cOh my, my little precious girl. You\u2019ve really frightened your grandpa. I even thought you were kidnapped by a bad person. Come, let your grandpa see if you\u2019re hurt anywhere. Oh my, look at you, you\u2019ve become skinnier\u2026\u201dThe elderly Ouyang lovingly patted Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s head with affection in his eyes.Ouyang Zongheng was full of smiles as well. \u201cMy obedient daughter, don\u2019t run away from home anymore. Right now, it\u2019s not safe within the imperial city. Let\u2019s wait until this period is over, and father will run away from home together with you.\u201dThe three barbarians of Ouyang expressionlessly watched this scene unfold. At the same time, they felt this world was filled with corruption. Why was it that even though they were siblings, the difference between their treatment was this large?Ouyang Zongheng felt their gaze and immediately put on a straight face. He snorted and said, \u201cWhat are you looking at? Hurry up and go train. If you don\u2019t reach fifth grade Battle-King by this year, you\u2019re really going to get it.\u201dThe three barbarians of Ouyang dejectedly ran away as fast as they could. As they were even leaving, they were even making eyes towards their little sister.Slap!The elderly Ouyang put on a straight face, then slapped the Ouyang Zongheng, who was putting on airs, on his head and said, \u201cWhat are you looking at? Hurry up and go train. If you don\u2019t reach sixth grade Battle-Emperor by this year, you\u2019re really going to get it.\u201dWhen Ouyang Xiaoyi saw this scene, she immediately laughed out loud. Then she grabbed onto the elderly Ouyang\u2019s beard and continued to giggle.\u2026Within the kitchen, Bu Fang was calmly retrieving a bag of flour from a cupboard. The flour was prepared by the system and was of the highest quality.He was preparing the other reward, the Golden Shumai.The shumai was not foreign to Bu Fang. It was a type of snack that had fillings wrapped in dough and cooked in a bamboo steamer. It could be eaten for breakfast, was shaped like a pomegranate, and was tasty. It had both the good points of xiaolongbao and gyoza.The skin of the shumai did not need to go through fermentation, so Bu Fang placed the kneaded dough on one side. According to the recipe provided by the system, there was some difference in the cooking method of this Golden Shumai compared to the traditional shumai. The ordinary Golden Shumai would have some pumpkin powder added within the flour, which resulted in the golden color of the shumai.However, Bu Fang did not agree with this method. The reason was that adding the pumpkin powder would cause the flour to lose its texture and did not improve the taste of the dish.That was why he took the egg yolk of a few third grade Thunderstorm Pigeons and added them into the flour mixture. By doing so, the skin of the shumai would have the fragrance of the Thunderstorm Pigeon\u2019s egg and the golden color.The next step was the filling of the shumai. There was actually no standard ingredient for the shumai, and the recipe which the system provided was for meat fillings.\u201cThe meat chosen is the tenderloin of the Flame Pig from the Wildlands. The meat is filled with rich spirit energy, and is fat but not greasy. It is an excellent meat ingredient,\u201d The system solemnly introduced.Bu Fang nodded and took out the tenderloin of the Flame Pig from the freezer. The surface of the meat was actually covered by a thin layer of fire; distinct marbling could be seen on it.After using the kitchen knife to tenderize the pork, Bu Fang began to cut it. His cutting speed was very fast and every cut he made was as if it was carefully calculated. Each piece of pork ended up as thin as the wings of a cicada.He did not chose to dice the entire piece of pork; one half of it was diced and the other half was sliced. Then he mixed the diced meat with diced vegetables that were rich in spirit energy, and used the pork slices\u2014that were as thick as the wings of cicada\u2014to wrap them.Once it was wrapped by the skin of the shumai with an opening left at the top, a small and exquisite shumai was made.Bu Fang\u2019s speed was extremely fast: he only needed around twenty seconds to wrap a shumai. With nine shumais per bamboo steamer, Bu Fang quickly completed them and placed them into the bamboo steamer.The bamboo steamer was provided by the system as well; it was made using bamboo that was slightly purple.While waiting for the shumai to be done, Bu Fang received his other reward: the winemaking technique.Wine was actually another type of gourmet food. With good wine, the aroma itself was capable of intoxicating people.Bu Fang had always wanted to provide wine within the store. However, the system had never made any mentions about it. He did not expect that he would suddenly receive the winemaking technique as a reward.\u201cWinemaking technique: the Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine is produced using the Nine Brewing Method. The brewer\u2019s yeast is made in December and thawed in January. Then 15 Kg of the yeast, fifty liters of spirit spring water, and the high quality Dragon Blood Kaoliang\u2014from the northern part of the Light Wind Empire\u2014is used. Distill it once every three days, and once it has been distilled a total of three times, the wine is ready.\u201d\u201cThis winemaking technique\u2026 It sounds really impressive.\u201d Bu Fang did not really understand, but was still impressed by the sound of it. But with such a complicated process, how long would it take to finally finish this?\u201cThe system has provided the enhanced version of the Nine Brewing Method, which quickens the fermentation time and wine production speed. With a cycle per day, only three days are required to produce the wine.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBu Fang went into a daze, then nodded. If it only required three days to produce the wine, then he could still look forward to it. He was getting slightly restless just thinking about it.However, while he was daydreaming about the Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine, the Golden Shumai was successfully completed.Bringing his attention back, Bu Fang carefully carried out the purple bamboo steamer and slowly lifted up the lid.The hazy steam rushed out and filled the air with a refreshing sweet smell. Within that steam, a golden ray of light pierced through. Then right in front of Bu Fang\u2019s eyes, this ray of light gradually bloomed and instantly filled his eyes.It was in a bright and dazzling gold!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The rich fragrance\u2014blended with a clear bamboo scent\u2014rushed towards Bu Fang and instantly drowned him within the sea of fragrance. Its sparkling, radiant skin looked like it caught on fire. There seemed to be flames burning, but upon a closer look they would disappear.The nine Golden Shumai were inside the purple bamboo steamer. They were so beautiful and flawless that they could be mistaken as artworks.As the fillings were first wrapped by a thin layer of pork, both the pork and the skin were deeply welded together after steaming. The filling was a mixture of diced meat and spirit vegetables that emanated an unparalleled fragrance. The moisture of the vegetables mixed together with the fat of the Flame Boar created an aromatic soup that rippled within the shumai.Bu Fang was eagerly looking at the Golden Shumai; his appetite was triggered by the rich fragrance. Using the purple bamboo chopsticks provided by the system, Bu Fang picked up one of the shumai. He did not immediately put it into his mouth, but first sucked out the soup inside.The soup\u2014that was slightly gold\u2014was a concoction of the spirit vegetables, meat from the Flame Boar, and purple bamboo. As it entered his mouth, it instantly enveloped his taste buds and filled his mouth with a rich fragrance.Bu Fang was absolutely delighted. After drinking the soup, he lightly took a bite of the shumai. The skin was extremely tender, and since it was mixed with the eggs of the Thunderstorm Pigeon, it contained a slight numbness. It was not strong, but when combined with the slight burning sensation from the meat of the Flame Boar, it had a unique taste.It was so delicious that Bu Fang almost wanted to swallow his own tongue.Soon, all nine shumai were completely eaten by Bu Fang and he was memorably licking his lips. Delicious food would always improve a person\u2019s mood.After cleaning up the kitchen, Bu Fang was preparing to brew the Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine. The brewer\u2019s yeast was provided by the system and had already gone through the necessary fermentation process. He only needed to directly use it.He placed the earthen jar\u2014that had half a human\u2019s height\u2014within the environment simulation cupboard and his job was done. He only needed to wait for three days and the Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine would be completed. Bu Fang was actually looking forward to this wine.After he completed everything, it was already midnight. Bu Fang yawned and was ready to sleep. As a chef, he needed to have high quality sleep. He would only have a healthy body if he sleep and woke up early every day.The next morning.Bu Fang opened up the store for business. The weather was not good that day. Dark clouds had covered up the sky and there was no sunlight.\u201cIt looks like it\u2019s going to rain,\u201d Bu Fang muttered to himself as he looked at the sky while standing at the entrance.Blackey lifted its head and glanced at him, then lay down and continued to sleep. He was so lazy that he did not want to move; it seemed that he was not going to seek shelter even if it is started to rain.Bu Fang was surprised as well. Even though the big black dog was living the life of a pig, why was it not becoming fatter? If a pig was raised like this, it would have already doubled its size, and yet this dog still maintained its slim figure.\u201cI think I\u2019ll improve your diet today,\u201d Bu Fang said as he stroked Blackey\u2019s unblemished fur.Then Bu Fang returned to the kitchen and began to practice his culinary skills. He prepared a serving of Golden Shumai, and used the rest of the filling to cook a dish of diced meat fried with diced vegetables.As Bu Fang carried out the aromatic dish out of the kitchen, the eyes of the big black dog were suddenly emanating an intense brightness as it stared at the bowl in his hands.\u201cMeat! There\u2019s meat!\u201d The big black dog thought and eagerly stretched out its tongue.Seeing Blackey devouring the food from the bowl, an awkward smile appeared on Bu Fang\u2019s face. He pulled a chair towards the entrance and curled up on it. As there was no warmth from the sunlight, Bu Fang was staring off into space.Soon, Fatty Jin and his buddies arrived. As they stepped into the store, they immediately noticed the new dish on the menu, the Golden Shumai.\u201cOh my, Owner Bu, is that a new dish? Shumai? Is it for breakfast?\u201d Fatty Jin\u2019s eyes lit up and he asked Bu Fang.\u201cYes.\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly nodded, then stood up and got ready for work. The arrival of Fatty Jin signified the start of the busy day.When Fatty Jin and his buddies saw the freshly made Golden Shumai, they were all stunned. The rich fragrance made them eager to taste the dish.Without a doubt, Bu Fang\u2019s dishes were the finest.Fatty Jin\u2019s mouth was covered with oil as he gobbled down the dish. The others whose cultivation levels had not reached third grade Battle-Maniac could only watch while drooling.\u201cOwner Bu\u2019s culinary skills is truly superb! This Golden Shumai is simply too delicious! It really suits my taste! Haha!\u201d After finishing the shumai, Fatty Jin wanted to order another serving but was heartlessly rejected by Bu Fang.Each serving of shumai cost ten crystals, but that was nothing for the prosperous Fatty Jin. However, as the quantity of the serving barely filled up his stomach, he ordered other dishes as well.After a while, Fatty Jin and his buddies left Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store feeling satisfied. It was their greatest happiness to be able to enjoy this taste every day.After Fatty Jin and his buddies left, a petite figure slowly arrived while rubbing her eyes.\u201cSmelly boss, I am not late, right?\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi said with a yawn.The sound of thunder could be heard from a distance.Just as Ouyang Xiaoyi entered the store, it started to rain outside. The continuous raindrops formed a curtain of rain in the sky, concealing the heaven and earth.\u201cNo, you\u2019re late,\u201d Bu Fang earnestly said.Ouyang Xiaoyi rolled her eyes in response, then stuck her tongue out and made a face at Bu Fang.\u201cSmelly boss! I brought enough money today, I want to eat breakfast!\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi triumphantly said as she took out a sachet and waved it in front of Bu Fang. The sound of crystals colliding could be heard from within the sachet.Bu Fang expressionlessly glanced at the sachet. There was a smiling pig\u2019s head sewn on it; it was definitely her style.\u201cOh. There\u2019s a new dish today, but your cultivation level isn\u2019t high enough. Otherwise, you would be able to taste it,\u201d Bu Fang simply said.Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s expression froze and she felt as if an invisible arrow had pierced into her chest. \u201cIt hurts!\u201d\u201cI will definitely work hard for the sake of food!\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi declared while pouting.\u201cOh, I am sure that your grandfather would definitely be glad to hear that,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly said.Glad? As if! If the elderly Ouyang knew that she was going to train hard just to eat good food, he might just vomit a few liters of blood.While the two of them were bickering, a figure appeared within the rain.With an oil-paper umbrella in hand and wearing a white robe, he looked gentle and refined with a smile on his face.The third prince slowly stepped into Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store and closed his oil-paper umbrella. He gave the umbrella a little shake to get rid of the water and leaned it on a wall near the entrance.Bu Fang curiously looked at the third prince. The third prince seemed a little different that day. Even though he still gave off a gentle and refined feeling, there was a slight bone-chilling coldness hidden in his refinement.Ji Chengxue stepped into Fang Fang Little\u2019s Store, but did not greet Bu Fang. He found a seat on his own and sat down.Ouyang Xiaoyi and Bu Fang were both puzzled.Shortly, the disarrayed sound of footsteps came from the alleyway, along with the sound of rain landing on bamboo hats.From a short distance away, four figures were slowly walking toward Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store from the entrance of the alleyway.The rain gradually became heavier and raindrops created splashes on the ground. The fog became thicker and the entire world seemed to be unreal at that moment. It was as if the rain had suddenly become silent.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAs the four figures stepped into Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store, a gust of rain and cold immediately invaded the space and the warm ambience instantly changed into a freezing atmosphere.Ouyang Xiaoyi shuddered and cowered toward Bu Fang\u2019s direction, while curiously staring at the four people with her large eyes.The four of them found separate seats and sat down. They did not speak with Bu Fang either as they imperceptibly surrounded Ji Chengxue.A raindrop dripped down from one of the bamboo hats and suddenly burst open as it hit the ground; it was like a sudden thunderclap had occurred within the quiet store.Then, four rays of dazzling white lights suddenly appeared\u2014like a short-lived flower\u2014as they rushed towards Ji Chengxue\u2019s position.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Four rays of light flashed with the sound of clashing metals, reflecting the sharpness of the blades as they stabbed toward the refined and gentle third prince from all directions.The humming of the swords resounded within the tiny space of the store, assaulting their eardrums.Within that instant when the flashes of light appeared, Bu Fang grabbed onto the petite body of Ouyang Xiaoyi and pulled her behind him to prevent her from getting embroiled in the carnage.Assassination! This was an attempt to assassinate Ji Chengxue!Ji Chengxue seemed to have expected it. He calmly sat on the chair with an indifferent expression.The moment when the four assassins approached, Ji Chengxue\u2019s long hair suddenly fluttered on its own. His gentle eyes seemed to have undergone a huge transformation as it changed into the eyes of an Asura; it was as if mountains of corpses and an endless sea of blood were wallowing within.\u201cTo have sent four fifth grade Battle-Kings to assassinate me, what an extravagant move.\u201d Ji Chengxue snorted as a surging wave of true energy gushed out of his body and charged toward the deadly assassins.However, the assassins remained steadfast and continued to aim for Ji Chengxue\u2019s heart. They were professionals that focused on killing with a single strike and would definitely not be affected by any of Ji Chengxue\u2019s actions.Ji Chengxue\u2019s palm landed on the table. The true energy of a Battle-King was instantly released and generated an impact that resulted in his entire body soaring into the air.\u201cHmm?\u201d Ji Chengxue\u2019s pupils slightly constricted as he looked in horror toward the table that he smacked with all of his strength. \u201cThis table endured my true energy, yet it\u2019s actually intact?!\u201dThe sound of clashing metals echoed out.The tip of the swords of the four assassins collided together. A clear melodic sound rang out as the energy from the swords dispersed and erupted within the store.However, the explosion of the sword energy from the four Battle-Kings did not cause any damage to the store in the slightest. It was as if the explosion was dispersed by an invisible force.Ji Chengxue\u2019s figure was floating in the air and gradually landed on the tip of the swords; his white robes were hovering and his hair was fluttering.The five of them formed a strange standstill, but the surging energy around them undoubtedly displayed the dangers of the current moment.The mood within the store was filled with coldness from this clash of killing intent. This made Bu Fang very dissatisfied.Within the quiet store, only the true energy collision between the five of them could be heard.\u201cIf you\u2019re looking for a fight, please leave the store. Otherwise, you\u2019ll all be viewed as troublemakers,\u201d a serene voice suddenly sounded out.The sudden appearance of the voice was like a thunderclap to them within this serious atmosphere, causing them to be shocked.The little loli, Ouyang Xiaoyi, was looking at Bu Fang like he was a monster as he slowly walked toward the five of them.That was right!At such a perilous moment, Bu Fang expressionlessly opened his mouth and voiced out his unhappiness. How was he going to do business with them causing carnage within the store?The four assassins were all focused on Ji Chengxue, but became distracted by Bu Fang\u2019s interruption.Even though Ji Chengxue was taken aback as well, he was able to make use of this opportunity. With a growl, he heavily stepped on the tip of their swords and knocked their swords away. Landing on the ground, he swiftly struck the chests of the four assassins with his palm and forced them backwards.\u201cAre you seeking death?\u201d One of the assassins coldly looked toward Bu Fang and hoarsely said. His voice was like sandpaper.In his eyes, Bu Fang\u2014a mere second grade Battle-Master\u2014was only an ant that could be easily killed with a single stroke of their sword. An ant-like fellow actually dared to disturb their assassination!\u201cI am the owner of this store. Did you get my permission before trying to assassinate someone here?\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly asked.\u201cWhat a joke.\u201d The assassin shook his head. He could not be bothered to care about Bu Fang; an ant-like fellow could not affect the situation. Their objective was the third prince of the Light Wind Empire, Ji Chengxue.Since Ji Chengxue was a Battle-King as well, they did not dare to be complacent. Even though there were four Battle-Kings on their side, their opponent was a prince. How could he not have any trump cards?\u201cI already said! Fighting is prohibited within Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store. If you continue with this, you shall be viewed as troublemakers,\u201d Bu Fang coldly said. He realized that these unforgivable fellows were actually ignoring him.As the owner of Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store and the future God of Cooking, how could they ignore him?!\u201cHow annoying! Die!\u201dThe gaze of one of the assassins suddenly turned cold. With a shout, he swiftly charged toward Bu Fang.Bu Fang was enveloped within a wave of killing intent, as if he was plunged into a pool of icy water. The blood in his veins had almost stopped circulating and his limbs could not even move an inch.This was the result of the use of coercion from a fifth grade Battle-King. It was not something the current Bu Fang could resist. His cultivation level was simply too weak.Ji Chengxue\u2019s expression changed and he angrily shouted, \u201cHow dare you!\u201dHe wanted to rescue Bu Fang, but was intercepted by the other three assassins.Ouyang Xiaoyi was already frozen with fear by the bone-chilling killing intent of the Battle-King. Her eyes were filled with horror and she was unable to lend a hand. Of course, even if she could intervene, there would not be any difference in the result.And so, it seemed that Bu Fang was caught in a lethal situation where he would certainly die\u2026 At least, that was what everyone in the store thought.For a Battle-Master to actually provoke a Battle-King, calling him fearless would not be enough as a compliment.Ji Chengxue and Ouyang Xiaoyi could only watch Bu Fang being completely torn into pieces by the assassin\u2019s sword.Bu Fang, on the other hand, was very calm. Even though the chilling killing intent made him feel as if the blood in his entire body was frozen, there was not even a single hint of fear on his expressionless face.Those eyes\u2026 looked as if he was looking at a mere thug causing trouble in his store.\u201cThis ant\u2026 He\u2019s pretty good at putting on an act. My sword is about to land on him, and yet it doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s even afraid?\u201d The assassin was slightly surprised.Suddenly, a gigantic figure appeared in the path of the assassin\u2019s sword. It cut off the assassin\u2019s line of sight to Bu Fang\u2019s figure and immediately startled the assassin.\u201cWhitey!\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi excitedly screamed as her eyes lit up.It was as if the assassin had seen a ghost. He saw a gigantic white iron puppet blocking the path to the ant and it grabbed hold of his sword with a single move.He tried to pull his sword free but it did not move even a single inch.Bu Fang lifted his hand and patted Whitey\u2019s back and simply said, \u201cThrow these troublemakers out.\u201d\u201cOh, and beat him half to death first, then strip him and throw him out. I hate him very much,\u201d Bu Fang added.Whitey\u2019s mechanic eyes immediately flashed red and a mechanic voice sounded out, \u201cTroublemakers, you will be stripped as an example to others.\u201dBang!!A huge and terrifying force rushed out of Whitey\u2019s body and that assassin\u2019s bamboo hat suddenly broke into pieces, revealing a round and bald head. His eyes widened as he spat out a mouthful of blood.The assassin was punched in the abdomen by Whitey; a Battle-King\u2019s true energy was dispersed by this single punch\u2026Whitey\u2019s large hand grabbed the head of the assassin and lifted him into the air as he stared at the iron puppet in bewilderment.Bang!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWhitey\u2019s fist landed on the assassin\u2019s body once more and he immediately fainted. The assassin sloppily lay on the floor, hanging on to life by a thread.\u201cJudged to be half dead. Will now begin to strip as an example to others,\u201d Whitey mechanically said.Then, sounds of tearing rang out as the assassin\u2019s straw raincoat was torn into pieces. He was immediately stripped naked by Whitey, leaving a tiny cloth to cover his private parts. Whitey gently waved its hand and the Battle-King was thrown out of the store like slush.Bang! The sound of flesh intimately colliding with the ground sounded out and echoed within the little store.The remaining three assassins, Ji Chengxue, and Ouyang Xiaoyi were all stunned. They stared at Whitey and then at Bu Fang\u2026 They looked like they had just seen a ghost.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This iron puppet\u2019s strength was contrary to his expectations. A fifth grade Battle-King was troublesome to deal with even for him, yet this Whitey was able to strip a Battle-King and throw him out of the store.The third prince did not expect Bu Fang to be that calm either. The sword had almost reached Bu Fang, but he managed to remain indifferent. Did he really have that much faith in that puppet?The remaining three assassins also recovered from their shock and looked at Whitey as if they were facing their greatest enemy. They did not dare to underestimate Bu Fang any longer. There was no other reason for it aside from the fact that the puppet was able to beat their comrade half to death with two punches.\u201cThere\u2019s a mistake with the information! There\u2019s something strange with this store!\u201d The three assassins looked at each other and their eyes underneath the bamboo hats were extremely serious.Without question, their assassination had failed. As an assassin, if their first strike had failed, they should immediately retreat and look for another opportunity. That was why they gave up on assassinating Ji Chengxue and ran to the entrance of the store.However, how could the three of them escape when they were already targeted by Whitey? The three escaping figures were captured by a gigantic force and pulled in front of the iron puppet.Whitey\u2019s mechanical eyes were blinking as it threw out three palm strikes in a row. The three of them each spat out a mouthful of blood and fell onto the floor. The bamboo hats on their heads were all torn to pieces as they helplessly lay there.The sound of tearing rang out, then the three assassins were thrown out naked like the first one. They fell into the alleyway with only a small cloth to cover their private parts.It was still raining heavily outside. Raindrops spilled down from the sky and rapidly formed a curtain that enshrouded the world.After completing everything, Whitey mechanically made a fist pump. Then its mechanical eyes flashed and it seemed quite happy as it returned to the kitchen.The coldness in Ji Chengxue\u2019s eyes gradually disappeared and they once again returned to their former refined state. The corner of his mouth held a hint of a smile as he meaningfully looked at Bu Fang.He suddenly realized that he was unable to see through this cook, who was only a second grade Battle-Master.\u201cWhat do you want to order?\u201d Bu Fang ignored Ji Chengxue\u2019s gaze and expressionlessly asked.\u201cI\u2019ll have Lees Fish. Today, I am lucky that Owner Bu was around to lend a hand. I wanted to drink in celebration but since there\u2019s no wine sold here, I can only order Lees Fish.\u201d The third prince, Ji Chengxue chuckled and nodded toward Bu Fang.If it was not for Whitey\u2019s help, then it would\u2019ve been really dangerous for him. Even he did not expect that they would be so deranged as to openly attack him within the imperial city.\u201cThere will be good wine for sale in a few days, but there really isn\u2019t any today,\u201d Bu Fang simply said as he headed toward the kitchen. Along the way, he gently patted Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2014who was still dumbstruck\u2014on the head.\u201cOh? There\u2019s going to be wine?\u201d Ji Chengxue\u2019s eyes lit up, then his smile became brighter as he meaningfully glanced at the slim figure of Bu Fang entering the kitchen.\u201cXiaoyi, I\u2019ll be going out for a while. Make sure to keep the Lees Fish for me when it\u2019s done,\u201d Ji Chengxue said to Ouyang Xiaoyi, who was still in a daze, as he slowly walked toward the entrance.\u201cOh, eh? Why are you going out?\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi blankly asked.However, Ji Chengxue did not answer her and just stepped out of the store.Just by taking a single step, the expression on Ji Chengxue\u2019s face suddenly changed. The gentle and refined smile disappeared and was replaced by a bone-chilling killing intent.He opened his umbrella to block out the curtain of rain falling from the sky. The rain water splashed onto his shoes and soaked his clothes.Within the alleyway, the four assassins stood up with difficulty. They were almost unable to open their eyes with the heavy rain spraying into them. Within the fog, they seemed to see a refined figure holding an oil-paper umbrella.Then their line of sight suddenly froze as their eyes widened.\u2026\u2026Ji Chengxue returned to the store and stepped into its warm interior once more. He blew into his hands and rubbed them together to disperse some of the coldness in his body. He shook off the rainwater on his robes as a gentle and refined smile reappeared on his face.\u201cXiaoyi, is the Lees Fish ready?\u201dOuyang Xiaoyi blinked and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not, but I can already smell the wine aroma. It should be ready soon.\u201dJi Chengxue nodded and returned to his seat. At his feet, rainwater with a reddish tinge slowly dripped off from the bottom of his robes. Ouyang Xiaoyi stared at the reddish puddle of water for a while without saying anything.The third prince did not say anything either. He closed his eyes and rested, as if he was thinking about something.After a while, a rich wine aroma drifted out of the kitchen and hovered within the store, washing away any residual killing intent.Ouyang Xiaoyi wobbled as she carried out the plate of Lees Fish. Along the way, the fragrance continuously drifted out from the plate. She used a handkerchief to block her nostrils and forced herself not to breathe in the smell. She was staring at the Lees Fish as she placed it in front of Ji Chengxue.\u201cYour Highness big brother, here\u2019s your fish,\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi said with a nasal voice.\u201cHaha, it\u2019s finally done. I was really craving this Lees Fish. In the entire empire, I admire Owner Bu\u2019s culinary skills the most.\u201d Ji Chengxue chuckled while patting Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s head.Bu Fang walked out of the kitchen as well. He carried out a bowl of fragrant Egg-Fried Rice and placed it opposite to Ji Chengxue\u2019s seat. He pointed toward it and said to Ouyang Xiaoyi, \u201cHere\u2019s your breakfast.\u201dOuyang Xiaoyi, who was still shocked from the assassination attempt, immediately calmed down. Her eyes lit up as she sat on the chair and started to gobble down the Egg-Fried Rice.Ji Chengxue\u2019s way of eating was very elegant; it was obvious that he was very self-disciplined.\u201cOwner Bu, do you really have no interest in becoming the imperial chef? With your culinary skills, you can definitely become the head chef of the imperial kitchen,\u201d Ji Chengxue tried to persuade him once more.\u201cI am not interested in becoming anyone\u2019s chef. If the emperor wishes to eat my dishes, then get him to personally queue up,\u201d Bu Fang indifferently replied. He said as if it was obvious and was not being pretentious about it.\u201cWith owner Bu\u2019s skills, it\u2019s a waste of your talent to stay here. If you would enter the imperial kitchen, you would surely be able to display your talents,\u201d Ji Chengxue said with a sigh.\u201cWho said that I can\u2019t display my talents within this alleyway? I believe that it won\u2019t be long before this place is teeming with customers,\u201d Bu Fang seriously and confidently said.Ji Chengxue was slightly startled by Bu Fang\u2019s reply. He subconsciously said, \u201cThat\u2019s not possible. With the prices of your dishes, ordinary people wouldn\u2019t be able to afford it.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that they can\u2019t afford it. It\u2019s that they can\u2019t eat it. You should understand the reason why my dishes are valuable,\u201d Bu Fang simply said.Whether it was the ordinary Egg-Fried Rice or the improved version, Lees Fish or the Fish Head Tofu Soup, the ingredients chosen were all from valuable spirit beasts and spirit herbs that were filled with spirit energy. Spirit beasts were originally valuable because they were difficult to capture; using them as ingredients for food was unbelievable. Spirit herbs were difficult to obtain and were usually used to make elixirs.Bu Fang\u2019s dishes managed to preserve most of the spirit energy from the ingredients. Eating one of his dishes was like eating an elixir and would help in cultivation. This was the reason why his dishes were valuable and a fact that Ji Chengxue and the rest had neglected.Bu Fang felt that he needed to remind this foolish child.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euJi Chengxue\u2019s was picking up a piece of fish with his chopsticks but suddenly stopped and his pupils constricted. He was extremely shocked, as if his heart was struck by a giant rock.That was right! Since he had become a fifth grade Battle-King, he needed an extremely large amount of spirit energy to break through to the next level. Bu Fang\u2019s dishes were unable to help him in that. He only came on a daily basis because of the taste of the dishes.However, after Bu Fang\u2019s reminder, he realized that the dishes may only have a miniscule effect on him due to his cultivation level. However, it was different for the other cultivators who were only Battle-Maniacs and Battle-Spirits!\u201cAlso, I need to remind you. In the future, there will be more and more dishes. The ingredients chosen will also be more and more powerful\u2026\u201d Bu Fang slowly said.\u201cThere might be a chance\u2026 for the meat of a ninth grade sacred beast to appear!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If his view of Bu Fang had not changed due to the incident that happened earlier, he would think that Bu Fang was someone with intellectual disabilities.What was a sacred beast? Within the entire Light Wind Empire, the strongest person that he knew was the number one great general of the empire, Xiao Meng. However, the great Xiao Meng who made the experts from the surrounding Sects despair was only a seventh grade Battle-Saint\u2026For the mere owner of a store\u2014who was only a Battle-Master\u2014within the remote alleyways of the capital to mention the meat of a sacred beast\u2026 Ji Chengxue had no idea of how strong a sacred beast was, but he could use General Xiao Meng as a comparison.A single sacred beast should be worth at least a few dozen General Xiao Meng. A single General Xiao Meng was able to dominate over a few hundred experts from the Sects. A few dozen General Xiao Meng\u2026 could probably destroy the imperial palace with a wave of their hand.\u201cOwner Bu really likes to joke around. I\u2019ve been to many places but I\u2019ve never heard of any news of ninth grade sacred beasts,\u201d Ji Chengxue said, while faintly smiling as he finished the Lees Fish.Bu Fang did not reply. He understood that Ji Chengxue did not believe him. However, he was not perturbed; it was natural for Ji Chengxue not to believe. After all, a sacred beast was far too terrifying.\u201cActually, the higher the grade of the spirit beast, the better will be the quality of their meat. They are like natural ingredients of the highest grade. If Your Highness were to obtain any good ingredients, you could bring them to the store and I will help you cook them,\u201d Bu Fang seriously said. The system had already risen to two stars and he was able to cook ingredients brought by the customers. That was why he decided to remind Ji Chengxue.\u201cOh? I can bring my own ingredients? This seems slightly interesting.\u201d Ji Chengxue\u2019s eyes lit up and he nodded.Outside, the rain had gradually come to a stop. The dark clouds were slowly dispersing, unveiling countless rays of warm sunlight.Ji Chengxue stood up and handed over twenty crystals from a sachet to Bu Fang. Then he rubbed the head of Ouyang Xiaoyi, who was still gobbling down the Egg-Fried Rice, and left the store while carrying his oil-paper umbrella.After the rain, puddles of water had accumulated on the quartzite floor of the alleyway. Green moss looked as if it was stretching while rain water slowly dripped from the walls that were still wet.The big black dog was still lying at the entrance as it sleepily yawned. Even after the rain, the fur on its body remained soft and shiny, without a single trace of wetness.Within the majestic imperial palace, row upon row of buildings were orderly built.Troops of armor-wearing guards were patrolling with grim expressions. They were not weak; the weakest among them was a third grade Battle-Maniac, while the leader of one of the troops was a fifth grade Battle-King.Ji Chengxue had returned to the palace. The leader of the patrol respectfully saluted when they spotted him and he indifferently nodded in their direction.Passing through the entrance of the imperial palace, he arrived at the vast and wide Gate of Heavenly Mystery Square. There were six stone pillars erected on the plaza, and carved upon each of them were unusual images of strange beasts and rare treasures.Ji Chengxue was standing in front of the Gate of Heavenly Mystery and looking at the wide plaza with a complicated expression. He took in a deep breath, inhaling the fresh air after a rain.The palace of the crown prince was situated behind the Gate of Heavenly Mystery.After passing through the Gate of Heavenly Mystery, a few dozen meters away to the left of the Great Hall of the imperial palace was the palace of the crown prince. With golden bricks and red tiles, it was magnificently and luxuriously built.\u201cYour Imperial Highness. According to our spies, there was an assassination attempt on the third prince in a restaurant within the imperial city,\u201d a middle-aged man with an impressive beard said\u2014while holding a message in his hand\u2014toward a seated young man within the palace of the crown prince.The young man was dressed in a golden python robe[1] and had a purple crown[2] on his head. He had a pale face and long, narrow dashing eyebrows. His eyes were slightly tilted like a sharp blade, giving off a demonic yet dignified aura.\u201cOh? Is he dead yet?\u201d the man simply asked. The first thing he asked was the fate of Ji Chengxue.\u201cNo. The third prince spent a long time battling the Sects outside our border. With his combat experience, mere assassins wouldn\u2019t be able to kill him.\u201d The refined middle-aged man laughed as he stroked his beard.\u201cThose who would dare to assassinate third brother would at least be Battle-Kings and third brother would definitely be injured. However, if he was injured, then the entire imperial city would know about it. If Father knew about it as well, the current state wouldn\u2019t be this peaceful.\u201d The crown prince opened his eyes, revealing dark and deep pupils.\u201cThe third prince is indeed unharmed. That\u2019s strange. Could it be that an expert aided him?\u201d The middle aged man pondered.\u201cXushi, isn\u2019t third brother constantly going to that restaurant in the alleyway these days? Is there anything abnormal about that restaurant? Did you send anyone to investigate?\u201d The crown prince asked.\u201cYour Highness\u2026 There\u2019s something weird with that restaurant,\u201d that middle-aged man called Xushi strangely said.\u201cHmm? How is it weird?\u201d\u201cThat restaurant is the black-hearted little store from the rumors circulating within the imperial city. A bowl of Egg-Fried Rice\u2026 costs ten crystals. A bowl of dry-mixed noodles costs a hundred gold coins. The most expensive dish is the Lees Fish, which costs twenty crystals. They really are astronomical dishes.\u201d Xushi had a weird expression on his face.\u201cIt truly is an astronomical price\u2026 Third brother has actually fallen in love with this black-hearted little store? It seems that there is definitely something about that store that no one knows about. Xushi, find an opportunity to visit that store.\u201d The corner of the crown prince\u2019s mouth curled up with interest.\u201cThere\u2019s two more days until Great General Xiao Meng triumphantly returns to the imperial city. The Great General Xiao Meng is truly incredible. He defeated the Heterodox Sect, Death Soul Palace, in one fell swoop and even captured their six leaders. With this, the morale of the Sects will surely suffer. This truly is the fortune of Light Wind Empire.\u201d The crown prince stood up and slowly paced around while sighing.\u201cIf I wish to secure my position as the crown prince or even become the emperor, I will definitely need the support of Great General Xiao.\u201d\u201cYour Highness, the Sects are showing signs of uprising these past few years. Since His Majesty sent General Xiao to conquer the Sects, I am afraid that Xiao Meng has become a thorn in their sides. He would surely be obstructed by the Sects as he escorted the prisoners into the imperial city. There has recently been some movements occurring within the imperial city. According to our spies, experts from the five great Orthodox Sects and the three great Heterodox Sects have already infiltrated into the imperial city,\u201d Xushi said with a frown.\u201cUnrest? It\u2019s better when there\u2019s unrest. There are some things that are easier to do when there\u2019s unrest. Isn\u2019t that what my second brother is thinking? Otherwise, why would he send assassins after third brother? However, he probably did not anticipate that third brother would return without any injuries.\u201d The crown prince chuckled with his hands behind his back as he looked into a distance.Xushi was stunned and did not say anything else. He was only an advisor; he would only speak when he should speak and would remain silent when he should not speak.\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I already know about third brother\u2019s matter. I am not worried about him. The one that I am concerned about is second brother. However, there\u2019s indeed something strange with the assassination this time. Send someone\u2026 No, you should personally visit that black-hearted little store. That store is indeed quite interesting,\u201d the crown prince said.Xushi nodded, then withdrew after performing a fist and palm salute.\u2026King Yu\u2019s manor.The second prince, Ji Chengyu, expressionlessly destroyed the letter in his hand.\u201cA mere restaurant dares to obstruct me. It looks like there\u2019s a need to visit this restaurant. I\u2019d to like see who\u2019s hiding inside that would actually dare to kill four of my fifth grade Battle-King assassins,\u201d King Yu coldly said.\u2026Within an hour of the third prince\u2019s assassination attempt, the high ranking officials and influential factions within the imperial city had received the news. Whether it was the Xiao manor or the Ouyang manor, they were shocked by the news. An assassination attempt on a prince was not a small matter.Naturally, other than the fact that there was an assassination attempt on the prince, Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store had entered the line of sight of these bigwigs as well. Many of them were extremely curious about this store that sold a bowl of Egg-Fried Rice for ten crystals.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euConsequently, various factions sent out their men to visit the store.At that moment, the owner of that store was leisurely curled up on a chair. The warm sunlight after the rain was enveloping his body, causing him to comfortably yawn.He may not know it yet, but a huge group of bigwigs was approaching.[1] Python Robe(\u87d2\u888d) \u2013 It was a robe worn by court officials in the past, named for the python sewn on it.[2] Purple Crown(\u7d2b\u91d1\u51a0) \u2013 It was also known as \u201cCrown Prince Helm\u201d.

The menu is on the wall. Tell me when you\u2019ve decided on your order.\u201dAs Xushi stepped into the store, a likable voice rang out. An adorable loli was staring at him while blinking her eyes.\u201cThe young lady from the Ouyang family?\u201d Xushi raised his eyebrows and was slightly surprised. Even though the intelligence from his spies had already mentioned Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s presence, he was still amazed when he actually saw her.\u201cWhy would the princess of the Ouyang family actually demean herself by becoming a waitress of this little store? Did she become stupid?\u201dAt the entrance, a slim and tall young man wearing a chef\u2019s uniform slowly got up. He was cracking his neck as he lazily walked toward the kitchen.\u201cThat\u2019s the owner of this store? His cultivation level is really low\u2026 How is it possible that he\u2019s only a second grade Battle-Master? To be able to kill four Battle-King assassins, he should be at least be a sixth grade Battle-Emperor.\u201dXushi thought as he stroked his beautiful, long beard while staring at Bu Fang\u2019s back in astonishment.\u201cHey, what are you ordering?!\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi unhappily asked. She was annoyed that this old fellow was not paying attention to an adorable loli like her and was staring at the smelly boss instead. Was her adorable charm inferior to that of smelly boss?Xushi awkwardly smiled as he turned his attention back to her and looked toward the menu on the wall. With this look, his pupils suddenly constricted.\u201cThe rumors were true. The number one shady store in the imperial city is indeed true to its name\u2026\u201d Xushi sucked in a breath of cold air and muttered to himself. Even though he was following the crown prince\u2019s orders to investigate this store, he was still bewildered when he saw the astronomical prices on the menu.\u201cI\u2019ll have\u2026 Fish Head Tofu Soup.\u201d Xushi was not someone who lacked money. He glanced through the menu and selected his favorite one, the Fish Head Tofu Soup.\u201cPlease wait a moment.\u201d The little loli snorted and headed toward the kitchen. She did not like this old fellow that paid more attention to the smelly boss than to her.Xushi found a seat and sat down. The store was not big and there were four tables. It was cozy and compact, while the environment was quiet and clean. The overall feeling that it gave customers was good.Da da da.A series of footsteps came from outside. Several people approached from a distance and stepped into the store.\u201cHmm? Xushi?\u201d A voice lightly exclaimed. Xushi was puzzled as he turned toward the entrance and saw a middle-aged man.\u201cGreat Secretariat Su, I didn\u2019t expect to see you here,\u201d Xushi stood up in surprise and did a fist and palm salute while slightly bowing. The middle-aged man in front of him was the great secretariat from the imperial court. Xushi was shocked that such a person would personally come to this little restaurant.Even though the Light Wind Empire was a martial country, there were still civil servants. After all, considering both martial and civil aspects was the true way of governing a country.Su Yuanqing recognized the man with the beautiful, long beard in front of him. Xushi, the favorite person of the crown prince, was well known within the imperial court.Since Su Yuanqing and Xushi were not familiar with each other, they took separate seats after exchanging greetings. Su Yuanqing ordered Egg-Fried Rice.Bu Fang was already busy cooking in the kitchen. \u201cIt seems that there\u2019s a lot of new customers today. What\u2019s going on? Could it be that someone within the imperial city is helping to advertise the store?\u201dEven though Bu Fang was puzzled, his hands did not stop. He scooped up a third grade Thunder Silver Carp and started to remove the scales. After the intestines were discarded, he rinsed the fish with water and chopped off the head.Keeping the head, the rest of the fish was thrown into Whitey\u2019s stomach area to be recycled. Then Bu Fang took out the sparkling Ice-crystal Jadeite Tofu from the freezer and began to cook the Fish Head Tofu Soup.While the Fish Head Tofu Soup was being simmered, Bu Fang took out a white egg that was as big as his fist from the freezer.It was the first egg laid by a fifth grade Deep Sea Foal Eagle and was rich with spirit energy. Bu Fang heavily tapped it against a blue and white porcelain bowl and managed to crack the egg into the bowl with one hand.While he was preparing the dishes, Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store was already packed with people.\u201cI\u2019ll have the Egg-Fried Rice.\u201d\u201cGive me the Dry-Mixed Noodles! And hurry up!\u201d\u201cI want the Lees Fish.\u201d\u2026..Watching as the customers squeezed into the store, Ouyang Xiaoyi was slightly dumbfounded. \u201cWhen did this store of ours\u2026 become so popular?\u201dShe counted at least a dozen customers. \u201cOh my heavens! Is this really the store that was completed deserted a few days ago?!\u201d\u201cEveryone, calm down. There\u2019s too many people, so queue up first,\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi loudly said. There was nothing else she could do. Since it was really inconvenient for the customers to squeeze into the store, she had to make them queue up. The space within the store was too small.\u201cQueue up? Little girl, do you know who I am? I am the housekeeper of Lord Zhang! How dare you make me queue up! Hurry up and let your boss serve me my food,\u201d A middle-aged man wearing a silk robe unhappily scolded Ouyang Xiaoyi.\u201cSo what if you\u2019re the housekeeper of Lord Zhang! Little girl, do you know who I am? I am the main housekeeper of the Director of the Board of Rites!\u201d\u201cIs a housekeeper of the Director of the Board of Rites that impressive? I am the personal bodyguard of King Mu!\u201d\u2026\u2026Ouyang Xiaoyi expressionlessly looked on as the group of customers endlessly quarrelled. Every one of them had self-important expressions on their faces.Even though the loli was amazed that the subordinates of the bigwigs would come to eat at a store located in an alleyway, she was very upset about how pompous they were.Xushi lightly shook his head as he listened to the argument behind him and thought that it was quite ridiculous. He clearly understood the reason why this group of people was there because they had the same objective as him.It was laughable that the crowd actually did not recognize the identity of the girl and wanted to jump the queue by announcing their background.Among these people, the waitress was the one with the scariest background. However, he could not be bothered to point it out to them.Just then, a rich fragrance drifted out of the kitchen. The smell was like a piece of silk rubbing across their cheeks. Everyone within the dining area went into a daze as they subconsciously breathed in the fragrance.The eyes of both Su Yuanqing and Xushi lit up. The smell was\u2026 very fragrant! There was a reason why the price was so high.Bu Fang was carrying the Egg-Fried Rice out of the kitchen when he saw the crowded situation in the dining area. He was stunned for a moment and was slightly unable to accept the fact that the store suddenly became popular.However, he remained calm and the astonishment only lasted for an instant before he became expressionless once more.\u201cEveryone has to queue up accordingly. Each customer can only order each dish once. Takeout is not allowed. Cutting in line is not allowed. Anyone who violates the rules will be blacklisted and service will no longer be provided to them,\u201d Bu Fang simply said. His voice was not loud but was able to overwhelm the noise.Then, within an instant, the entire store erupted into an uproar.These people were sent by their masters to investigate the store. They were used to lording over others outside, so how could they tolerate so many rules from a tiny store like this? They instantly started to clamor.Bu Fang expressionlessly placed the Egg-Fried Rice in front of Su Yuanqing.\u201cHere\u2019s your improved Egg-Fried Rice, please enjoy your meal,\u201d Bu Fang said.Su Yuanqing\u2019s sight was already attracted by the Egg-Fried Rice. He nodded and no longer paid any attention to Bu Fang.\u201cBe quiet! Don\u2019t make such a racket!\u201d Bu Fang coldly shouted while frowning.\u201cGosh, darn it! You brat, don\u2019t push your luck! I am giving you face by eating here! I am the subordinate of Lord Zhang! I am not someone you can afford to offend!\u201d The housekeeper angrily scolded while pointing at Bu Fang.The others were also pointing at Bu Fang while indignantly swearing.The store that was quiet for a moment became noisy once more.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOuyang Xiaoyi rolled her eyes and then saw the irritable expression on Bu Fang\u2019s face. She suddenly decided to silently observe these people for a moment. Of all the places they could act conceited in, they had to come to Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store\u2026With a series of mechanical sounds, Whitey\u2019s gigantic figure appeared behind Bu Fang with its mechanical eyes flashing.\u201cOh my! Do you think that you\u2019re invincible just because you have an iron puppet? Is this where your confidence is coming from?!\u201d When the housekeeper saw Whitey, he was amused for a moment. He had seen plenty of puppets before and knew that they were all just a bunch of junk.Bu Fang narrowed his eyes and pointed toward the housekeeper of Lord Zhang.\u201cVery well, you\u2019ve been blacklisted.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A lowly cook like you?\u201dLord Zhang\u2019s housekeeper was startled by Bu Fang\u2019s actions and started to laugh out loud. He was laughing so much that tears were almost coming out.The people around them could not help but snicker as they looked at Bu Fang with ridicule and contempt in their eyes. Was this young cook an idiot? Did he not know who he was speaking to? That was the housekeeper of Lord Zhang!Lord Zhang was a noble and renowned bigwig within the imperial city, and his housekeeper was naturally well-known as well. For the cook of a little restaurant located within an alleyway to shamelessly boast that he would blacklist the housekeeper of Lord Zhang, it was the biggest joke in history.\u201cDo you know how easy it is for me to tear down this restaurant? The fact that I am eating here is giving you face. You should be happily serving my food to me. Who gave you the courage to be conceited in front of me?\u201dThe housekeeper snorted while haughtily crossing his arms.Bu Fang was expressionlessly looking at the housekeeper as if he was looking at an idiot.\u201cHousekeeper? Is that something impressive? Even a prince was rejected by me, do you think I would care about a housekeeper?\u201dBu Fang did not even bother to reply and just lightly patted Whitey\u2019s wide belly. Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s eyes lit up and she was overjoyed to see Whitey in action again.Whitey\u2019s mechanical eyes suddenly lit up and flashed red as it mechanically said, \u201cTroublemaker, you will be stripped as an example to others.\u201dLord Zhang\u2019s housekeeper was startled. Putting his hand over his ear, he stretched out his neck and taunted, \u201cWhat? What are you going to strip?\u201cSay it again, what are you going to strip?\u201dWhitey\u2019s mechanical head slightly rotated and locked on the housekeeper. Its mechanical arms instantly reached out and grabbed him.\u201cHmph! How impudent!\u201d Lord Zhang\u2019s housekeeper coldly snorted with a sullen expression. As a third grade Battle-Maniac, there was no way that he would be afraid of a piece of junk that did not even have the slightest spirit energy.\u201cI will turn you into scrap metal! Take this, Bone Breaking Palm!\u201dWith a loud shout, the housekeeper imposingly gathered true energy within his body and struck Whitey\u2019s mechanical arm with his palm.Bang!The result was very different from his expectations.The fierce palm strike by Lord Zhang\u2019s housekeeper was like a drop in the ocean as it made contact with Whitey\u2019s arm. Whitey did not even budge from the attack.\u201cGosh, darn it!\u201dThe housekeeper\u2019s body stiffened as he awkwardly raised his head and made eye contact with Whitey\u2019s mechanical eyes. Then, Whitey proceeded to slap the housekeeper into the ground like it was slapping a fly.The true energy within his body was dispersed in an instant\u2026The sound of cloth tearing rang out as the housekeeper\u2019s clothes were being torn off. After there was only a loincloth left to cover his private parts, he was then thrown out of the store in a parabolic arc.Everyone in the store was dumbfounded while their eyes were transfixed by the housekeeper\u2019s body. As they watched it sail through the air, their entire bodies shuddered.Zhao Ruge only just arrived at the entrance when a human figure flew out of the store and landed at his feet\u2026 For some reason, there was a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu about the situation.It seemed that every time he went to the store, there would be someone flying out naked.\u201cI\u2019ll say it again, queue up accordingly and do not make any noise. Any violators will be blacklisted,\u201d Bu Fang simply said as he swept his eyes over the now silent crowd. Then he turned around and returned to the kitchen.Ouyang Xiaoyi was standing behind him with her fist clenched. \u201cThe smelly boss is really impressive!\u201dZhao Ruge shuddered as he recalled his previous nude streaking experience. His original intention to jump queue disappeared as well and he obediently lined up at the back of the queue.When the Minister of the Left, Zhao Musheng, found out that there was an attempted assassination on the third prince, he sent out his son, Zhao Ruge, to investigate the store. In the beginning, Zhao Ruge flatly refused. However, when his father promised him a fifth grade Spirit Gathering Pill as a reward, he shamefully compromised.Xushi was gravely staring at Whitey. Even a fifth grade Battle-King like him felt a slight pressure from it. \u201cThis puppet isn\u2019t simple.\u201dGreat Secretariat Su Yuanqing was pensively nodding his head as well. \u201cThis must be the hidden expert of this restaurant.\u201dThe two of them looked up and smiled at each other. Then, they lowered their heads and continued to gobbled down the food. It was simply too good!Intimidated by Whitey, the subordinates of the bigwigs were much more docile. The cultivation level of Lord Zhang\u2019s housekeeper was considered quite strong among them. However, he was still helplessly stripped naked by Whitey.Without a doubt, they would only end up the same way if they tried anything. They could only be docile if they did not want to end up naked.Ouyang Xiaoyi haughtily glanced at them as she memorized their orders and reported them to Bu Fang.Xishu and Great Secretariat Su reluctantly finished their food with enraptured expressions. There was a reason for the expensive prices of the dishes. The taste was even better than food from the imperial kitchen. Also, the two of them could feel the true energy within their body had increased. It was obvious that the dishes were extraordinary.As they hurriedly left the store, the people at the start of the queue took their seats. Bu Fang\u2019s cooking speed was fast as well, so they did not have to wait for too long.Without a doubt, everyone who tasted Bu Fang\u2019s dishes was completely subdued.Zhao Ruge\u2019s appetite was being triggered as he breathed in the fragrance drifting from the store and watched the customers\u2014that had finished eating\u2014reluctantly leave.It was his third time coming to the store, but he was unable to taste the dishes the previous times. From the looks of it, they seemed pretty good. He was looking forward to trying them out.When someone satisfactorily left the store, a joyful expression immediately appeared on Zhao Ruge\u2019s face. He elegantly walked into the store and gracefully stopped in front of Ouyang Xiaoyi.\u201cOh, it\u2019s you, sissy Zhao,\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi looked up and said while pouting. She obviously knew Zhao Ruge.\u201cFor the princess of Ouyang family to humbly become a waitress, what a waste. Tsk, tsk, tsk. I\u2019ll have Lees Fish,\u201d Zhao Ruge ordered after glancing at the menu. If he had to eat, he would eat the most expensive dish.\u201cThat\u2019s none of your concern!\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi snorted while scrunching her nose.She turned around and walked to the entrance of the kitchen to report the order. However, before she could shout it out, Bu Fang expressionlessly walked out of the kitchen.\u201cToday\u2019s business hours is over. Customers who haven\u2019t eaten, come back tomorrow,\u201d Bu Fang simply said.With his words, the eight people in the queue started to clamor.\u201cWhat? We\u2019ve already waited for close to an hour and you\u2019re telling us that you\u2019re not cooking anymore?\u201d\u201cOwner Bu, this is unfair to us! It\u2019s still early, so you should continue cooking. We want to taste your dishes.\u201d\u2026\u2026Bu Fang was unfazed while facing the countless complaints by the crowd.\u201cI\u2019ll say it again. Today\u2019s business hours is over. If you want to eat, come early tomorrow. Oh, and please don\u2019t make a racket,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly said.Behind him, Whitey\u2019s mechanical eyes were shining red as they locked on the people who were clamoring. Immediately, these people went silent as if they were being strangled.With Whitey keeping watch, they could only swallow their anger and resentfully leave while thinking about how to report to their masters.Zhao Ruge felt as if a countless amount of invisible arrows had pierced his chest. \u201cDamn it, business hours is over again?! Could you not be so punctual?\u201d\u201cOwner Bu, I\u2019ll pay five times the price\u2026 I want to order!\u201d Unwilling to give up, Zhao Ruge tried to persuade Bu Fang.\u201cI refuse. You\u2019ve already tried to tempt me the previous time,\u201d Bu Fang simply said.\u201cRules are determined by humans, Owner Bu! Ten times! How about ten times the price? Today, I definitely must try out your dishes,\u201d Zhao Ruge gnashed his teeth and said while ominously glaring at Bu Fang.\u201cNo.\u201d Bu Fang\u2019s heart was bleeding as he resentfully rejected Zhao Ruge. \u201cIf you raise your offer once more, I will definitely beat you up!\u201dZhao Ruge was so depressed that he wanted to vomit blood. He coldly glanced at Bu Fang, then angrily snorted and stormed out of the store.Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s face was filled with admiration as she looked at Bu Fang. She always thought that Bu Fang was a greedy person. She did not think that he would be so principled.\u201cSmelly boss, the way you rejected that sissy was so handsome!\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi gave him a thumbs up.\u201cHaha,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly smiled.\u2026On the next two days, Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store was always teeming with people. There were new customers arriving every day. Xushi and Great Secretariat Su would come every single day and were completely subdued by Bu Fang\u2019s food.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOn the other hand, the Xiao siblings and the third prince, Ji Chengxue, did not appear during that time. Of course, Bu Fang was slightly surprised but did not pay any heed.And so, the third day arrived.It was also a very important day in the imperial city.The number one expert in the imperial city, Great General Xiao Meng, was triumphantly returning after battling the clans outside the empire borders. He was escorting the six leaders of the Heterodox Sect, Death Soul Palace, that he took as prisoners back to the imperial city.That day, the imperial city was filled with opportunities as the city gates were laid wide open.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There were crowds of people gathered making a racket. The noise was so loud that it seemed that it was going to capsize the imperial city.The people were all focusing their attention as they curiously and expectantly looked toward the city gate.As the icy cold autumn wind blew, the dead leaves on the main street of the imperial city were blown into the air. Since the first group of soldiers entered the city, the mood of the imperial city was somber. The spectating crowd was absolutely silent as hundreds of blood-red flags marched past. It was like a sea of blood as the flags fluttered in the wind.The troops in armor were marching in step and every single step was filled with a chilly metallic sound as it resounded throughout the imperial city.Within the troops, the leader was a middle-aged man riding a reddish-brown horse. His sharp gaze and handsome features gave off a commanding aura.This man was the number one expert in the Light Wind Empire, the Great General Xiao Meng, who was triumphantly returning after battling the Sects.Within the long and narrow rank of troops, there were six steel prisoner carriages being escorted. The exterior of the cages were splattered with blood, that filled the air with a pungent smell. The carriages were being pulled by gigantic spirit beasts and each step they took made the ground tremble.Even though the heads of the prisoners within the carriages were lowered and they were barely breathing, their identities were shockingly well-known outside of the border. They were the six leaders of the Heterodox Sect, Death Soul Palace and every single one of them was a sixth grade Battle-Emperor.Each of them used to be influential and eminent individuals but were now reduced to prisoners.The carriages were generating a lot of noise as the wheels rolled over the quartzite flooring of the imperial city. The crowd was also loudly cheering after their initial silence.They were always enthusiastic toward soldiers that returned in triumph and such a victory would definitely be celebrated. As a country became stronger, the citizens would be proud as well. This was the so-called patriotism.The hardened and disciplined troops were indifferent to the cheers of the crowd. They continued to orderly march toward their destination, the majestic palace.A tall platform was built at the Gate of Heavenly Mystery Square, in front of the palace. Colorful flags were set up in the surrounding area and were fluttering in the autumn wind.The palace guards neatly surrounded the Gate of Heavenly Mystery Square to ensure order.\u201cWe welcome the triumphant return of Great General Xiao!\u201dAs the troops stepped into the Gate of Heavenly Mystery, the sharp voice of a eunuch\u2014accompanied with true energy\u2014resounded throughout the entire city and could almost be heard in every nook and cranny. It was soon followed by another round of cheers.On the platform, an elderly man wearing a dragon robe[1] was smiling. He gently looked at the homecoming troops and nodded from time to time.Not far from the elderly man, the crown prince, Ji Chengan, was leisurely standing there in his python robe. On his right was the heroic-looking King Yu, Ji Chengyu, and the third prince, Ji Chengxue.On the sides of the tall platform, the court officials were standing with their hands in a fist and palm salute. Below the platform, members of the Xiao family were excited as they watched the slow approach of the homecoming troops and were unable to suppress their joyful feelings.Xiao Meng took off his helmet and walked onto the tall platform. Then he stopped in front of the emperor, knelt down on one knee, then put his hands together in a fist and palm salute and said, \u201cYour servant did not fail Your Majesty\u2019s orders. We eliminated over ten thousand members of the Death Soul Palace, killed hundreds of Death Soul Palace experts above third grade Battle-Maniac, captured six of their leaders alive, and triumphantly returned.\u201d\u201cGood! Good! Good! My dear subject, you are truly the pillar of the Light Wind Empire. As long as you are around, my empire is safe!\u201dThe Emperor Ji Changfeng laughed and did not hesitate to give praises.Soon, a few rituals were neatly and tidily carried out. Everyone meticulously completed their jobs.\u201cThe welcome ceremony has ended. We will now move to the Great Hall to enjoy the celebration feast,\u201d the sharp voice of the eunuch resounded throughout the city once more.\u2026Bu Fang opened his sleepy eyes. He woke up earlier than usual that day, mainly because he was woken up by the two shouts of a eunuch that came out of nowhere.After Bu Fang finished washing up, he went into the kitchen and started his daily cooking practice. He took a portion of his practice dishes and served it to the big black dog at the entrance.As he expressionlessly watched the big black dog gobble down the food, he suddenly had a strange feeling: he felt that he was treating the dog like it was a lord.After opening up to the store for business, Bu Fang yawned, grabbed a chair and sat down, then started to wait for customers to arrive.However, after an hour passed\u2026 the store was still deserted and without any customer. It was slightly unbelievable for a store that was teeming with customers in the past few days.\u201cThere\u2019s something strange going on today. Why isn\u2019t there even a single customer? Normally, Fatty Jin and his fat army would have already finished eating and would be paying the bill by now.\u201cAnd the little loli did not turn up for work as well. Did the waitress and the diners disappear at the same time or something?\u201dBu Fang was silent for a moment, then finally went into the kitchen. He suddenly remembered that Xiaoyi seemed to have mentioned that \u201cXiao-something\u201d was returning to the imperial city and that she needed to apply for leave.However, why were the customers missing as well? That was what Bu Fang was concerned about.The truth was that the customers who ate at his store were all people with status. To celebrate the triumphant homecoming of Xiao Meng, the emperor set up a celebration feast at the Great Hall and invited every renowned and influential person in the imperial city. As Fatty Jin and the rest had all gone to the palace to attend the celebration, it was natural that they were not at the store.Bu Fang opened up the environment simulation cupboard, then took out an earthen jar\u2014that had half a human\u2019s height\u2014and placed it in the middle of the kitchen.\u201cIt takes three days for the wine to be completed, and it has been three days since I placed this jar into the cupboard. This Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine should be ready.\u201d Bu Fang suddenly remembered that he was still brewing a jar of wine. He originally planned to take it out that night, but since there were no customers, he decided to take a look.Taking out three small earthen jars prepared by the system, he was ready to unseal the jar and filter the wine.In the same instant as he removed the cloth cover that was sealing the earthen jar, a burst of wine aroma gushed out of the jar and rushed into his face.After deeply inhaling the wine aroma, Bu Fang was slightly shaking as a soft redness appeared on his face.\u201cThe aroma is rich but does not irritate the nose, and strong but not overwhelming\u2026 \u201d Bu Fang already had made an evaluation and was slightly joyous.Taking out a bamboo ladle prepared by the system, Bu Fang reached into the earthen jar and scooped out half a ladle of wine. The exterior of the ladle was verdant while the interior was a yellowish beige. The wine itself was as clear as water, without any impurities to be seen.As expected of the wine produced by the magnificent Nine Brewing Method, the Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine was true to its name and was as clear as the water found in deep ravines.Bu Fang brought the ladle closer to his nose and took a deep breath. The rich and thick wine aroma immediately filled his nasal cavities. Before he even drank a single sip of the wine, he was already salivating and slightly intoxicated.As he poured the wine from the ladle into a blue and white porcelain wine cup, the stream of wine was pristine and transparent, like top-quality wine.Bu Fang eagerly lifted up the wine cup and brought it to his lips. As the wine entered his mouth, it enveloped his tongue and instantly flowed down his throat. A cold feeling spread through his entire body, then in the next moment, it was like a raging fire was burning in his stomach. Just when the flames were going to overwhelm him, he felt a cold feeling reappearing once more. The heat and the cold were constantly alternating\u2026\u201cWhat a fine wine!\u201d Bu Fang smacked his lips with his face filled with enjoyment. Even though he was not knowledgeable when it came to wine, it was the best wine that he had ever tasted.However, even though the taste was delicious, the aftereffect was too strong. After all, with its complicated brewing process, it was natural that the aftereffect would be strong.Suppressing the urge to continue drinking, Bu Fang filled up the three small earthen jars and covered them with cloth covers. After pasting a rectangular red paper with the character, \u201cIce\u201d, written on it, the work was finished.After especially keeping a jar of wine for himself, Bu Fang placed the earthen jar back into the environment simulation cupboard. He was holding the wine cup in his hands as he happily walked back to the front of the store, planning to slowly enjoy it on his own.However, when he left the kitchen, he discovered someone standing at the entrance. It was a man in black clothing with a black-veiled bamboo hat and a long sword\u2014wrapped in a rag\u2014on his back.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euA hoarse voice came out of the man\u2019s mouth, with a trace of yearning.\u201cShop owner, do you have any fine wine in here?\u201d\u2014[1] Dragon robes(\u9f99\u888d) \u2013 This can only be worn by emperors and as its name implies, images of dragons are sewn on top of it.[2] Black-veiled bamboo hat (\u9ed1\u7eb1\u6597\u7b20) \u2013 It\u2019s basically a bamboo hat with a veil hanging from the edges to hide the face of the users.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He wanted to slowly enjoy the wine, but since there was a customer, he put down the wine cup from his hands.That man delightedly stepped into the store, sat down at a table, and hoarsely said, \u201cOwner, give me a jar of wine.\u201dBu Fang expressionlessly acknowledged with a nod. Then he turned to look at the menu and there was a new dish on it.\u201cIce Heart Jade Urn Wine, fifteen crystals per jar.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only fifteen crystals? It\u2019s really not expensive.\u201d Bu Fang was startled, but quickly understood the reason. Even though the Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine was a fine wine, the ingredients used were not that expensive compared to the other dishes.It\u2019s only selling point was the tedious manufacturing process of the Nine Brewing Method. As for the ingredients, they were considered ordinary. The rice used was a superior type of spirit rice, but was not much better than the Pearl Rice used in Egg-Fried Rice.\u201cSystem, isn\u2019t the price too cheap?\u201d Bu Fang silently asked the system.\u201cThe price set by the system is reasonable. It is determined by the combination of ingredients, process, and time. The Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine is still a mundane wine after all, so the price won\u2019t be too high. Compared to fruit wine and spirit wine made from high grade ingredients, there\u2019ll still be quite a difference in price. Fifteen crystals is already the maximum for a mundane wine,\u201d the system solemnly explained.Bu Fang nodded to indicate that he understood.\u201cThe Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine will cost fifteen crystals per jar,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly said to the man wearing the bamboo hat.\u201cFifteen crystals?\u201d The man seemed to be slightly surprised. It seemed slightly ridiculous for a jar of wine to cost fifteen crystals. However, when he looked at the menu, he became silent.After a while, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll have a jar. When I passed by the alleyway earlier on, I was suddenly attracted by the smell of a rich wine aroma that was drifting out. I hope the wine here is worthy of its price.\u201dQuality goods did not need advertising. The corner of Bu Fang\u2019s mouth slightly curled up.\u201cYou won\u2019t be disappointed by my wine,\u201d Bu Fang confidently replied. Then he walked back into the kitchen and took out a jar of Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine from a cupboard.The small earthen jar was actually not that big and was even smaller than the ordinary jars used to store wine. Bu Fang placed the jar of wine in front of the man wearing the bamboo hat and simply said, \u201cHere\u2019s your wine.\u201dThe man nodded, then slowly took off his black-veiled bamboo hat and finally unveiled his face.Bu Fang was slightly surprised by the other party\u2019s facial features. Just from looking at the profile, the man seemed familiar to him.As the other party took off the bamboo hat, a beautiful with a refined aura was revealed. He had a handsome face with eyes as bright as stars and a mouth that smiled naturally.\u201cThat\u2019s right! This guy actually resembles that sissy, Xiao Xiaolong!\u201d\u201cOwner, why are you looking at me like that?\u201d The man chuckled and hoarsely asked.\u201cYou look familiar, that\u2019s all. Enjoy your drink,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly replied. Then he sat down and began to enjoy his own cup of wine.The man was unconcerned as well. His throat slightly moved as he removed the cloth cover of the wine jar.A rich wine aroma instantly gushed out like the eruption of a volcano and rushed through his nostrils into the depths of his heart. He was wholeheartedly indulging in the aroma.He started pouring the wine into the blue and white porcelain wine cup given by Bu Fang. The crystal-clear wine was as pristine as clear springs found in deep mountains and was not murky in the slightest.\u201cGood wine!\u201d the man was unable to suppress his joy as he softly exclaimed. Then he carefully lifted up the wine cup and slowly drank from it.As the wine flowed down his throat, it instantly opened up the pores in his body. He violently exhaled as his eyes lit up and were filled with incredulity.He was completely captivated by the rich aroma and the ice and fire feeling of the wine.\u201cGood wine! It\u2019s comparable to the Bejewelled Nectar Wine from the imperial palace!\u201d the man praised it once more.It was strong, mellow, and aromatic! It was even able to stimulate the true energy within the body! It was definitely worth more than the fifteen crystals!\u201cHaha! I didn\u2019t think that I would be able to find such a fine wine, I am really lucky! They\u2019re drinking the Bejewelled Nectar in the palace, while I am tasting the Ice Heart Jade Urn here. I am not losing out at all.\u201d The man laughed and poured another cup of wine. Drinking it down in one go, the spiciness in his throat caused a touch of redness to appear on his fair skin.Bu Fang was much more refined as he pleasantly sipped from the wine cup. His drinking capacity was not that good, so he only filled a small cup of wine.\u201cOwner, do you have any dish that goes well with wine?\u201d the man finished a cup of wine, then turned to Bu Fang\u2014who was sipping from the wine cup\u2014and asked.\u201cNo,\u201d Bu Fang simply replied.A slight disappointment appeared on his face, but quickly disappeared as he continued with his drinking.\u201cWhy are you still open for business today? Why didn\u2019t you go to watch the homecoming of the Great General Xiao Meng?\u201d the man asked Bu Fang. He was much more talkative after drinking a few cups of wine.\u201cWhat does his homecoming have to do with me?\u201d Bu Fang calmly replied.The man suddenly went into a daze, then started laughing and seemed to be really happy.\u201cThe owner is a hot-blooded person. Let me give you a toast.\u201d The man laughed and drank down a cup of wine.Bu Fang remained expressionless as he continued to leisurely sip from his wine cup.Someone once said that there were two methods to drink wine. The first method was purely drinking the wine. It was just pouring the wine into the mouth and tasting the mellowness.The other method was drinking emotions instead of wine. Drinking wine when having different emotions would produce different tastes. That was how a person who truly knew wine would drink.When someone drank when he was in love, he would be overjoyed. When someone drank when he was angry, he would be daunting even if he was not angry. When someone drank when he was sorrowful, he would become melancholy. When someone drank when he was happy, he would not be able to stop drinking.\u201cThat\u2019s right, what does his homecoming have to do with you? No matter how glorious he is, he\u2019s still an executioner with blood-stained hands. He\u2019s still just a sharp blade in the hands of Ji Changfeng.\u201d The man suddenly became melancholy as he rapidly drank cup after cup.\u201cThis is someone with a story,\u201d Bu Fang blinked and thought as he continued to sip from his wine cup.After that, the man spoke very little as he continued to constantly pour and drink the wine. Soon, a jar of Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine was finished and the man seemed to be slightly intoxicated as his eyes turned cloudy.The intensity of the Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine was unimaginable for Bu Fang. He might be able to drink half a jar of ordinary wine, but he would only be able to drink three cups of the Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine at most.However, this man was able to completely finish the entire jar and was only slightly intoxicated. His drinking capacity was truly shocking.\u201cOwner, there\u2019s no more wine! Get me another jar,\u201d the man said with a frown.\u201cEach person is limited to one jar,\u201d Bu Fang simply replied. He was also finished with the cup of wine in his hands and his face was slightly flushed.The man banged on the table with his hand and lightly belched as dozens of crystals appeared on the table. \u201cOwner, the amount of crystals is not a problem. Get me another jar.\u201d\u201cThe store\u2019s rules: each person is limited to one jar,\u201d Bu Fang remained unmoved as he expressionlessly replied.The man frowned, then his hand suddenly banged on the table and the sword that was wrapped up in a rag immediately came out of its sheath.The cry of the sword incessantly resounded like a dragon\u2019s roar within the store.The man was holding the sword with one hand as he pointed it at Bu Fang. The tip of the sword was only an inch away from Bu Fang\u2019s nose and he could even feel the chill emanating from it.Faint goosebumps instantly covered Bu Fang\u2019s entire body, but he remained expressionless.\u201cDo you know who I am? Do you really dare to not provide wine to me?\u201d The man teasingly said with a smile.\u201cWhy should I care who you are? Are you trying to cause trouble?\u201d Bu Fang simply replied. Even though the tip of the sword was only an inch away, he remained unmoved by it.The man watched Bu Fang for a while, then sheathed the longsword and wrapped it back in the rags. The sword energy that was raging within the store moments ago vanished.\u201cThe owner is truly a strange person. Here is thirty crystals, I am reserving tomorrow\u2019s Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine,\u201d the man said with a laugh. Then he put on his bamboo hat, slung his longsword behind his back and headed toward the entrance.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAs he reached the entrance, he asked, \u201cDoes the owner really not know who I am?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know and there\u2019s no need for me to know. Anyone who enters my store is a customer. I\u2019ll welcome anyone as long as they don\u2019t cause trouble,\u201d Bu Fang seriously said.\u201cHahaha! Good! I, Xiao Yue of the Void Sword Pavilion, acknowledge you as a friend!\u201d The man laughed as he suddenly stepped out of the entrance and disappeared into the windy autumn.\u201cXiao Yue? His surname is Xiao\u2026\u201d Bu Fang pondered. However, he pursed his lips and muttered to himself, \u201cWhat an egoistic fellow. Who acknowledged you as a friend?\u201dAs he finished muttering, the voice of the system suddenly rang out in his mind\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The system reward is being released\u2026\u201dThe system\u2019s solemn voice rang out in Bu Fang\u2019s mind, startling him and waking him up from his slight intoxication.He did not even realize that so many days had passed and he had already earned five hundred crystals. Even Bu Fang\u2019s expressionless face twitched and a smile appeared as the corners of his mouth curled up.\u201cYoung man aiming to become the God of Cooking, congratulations for completing a short-term sales mission. You have once again taken a step to achieving your goal. Reward: Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs cooking method, Meteor Cutting Technique training method, and one fragment of the God of Cooking Set.\u201d\u201cSweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs?!\u201dWhen Bu Fang heard the solemn voice of the system say this phrase, he subconsciously swallowed his saliva. He was very familiar with this dish, because it was one of his favorite dishes back on Earth.Bu Fang was joyous that he finally unlocked a new dish and it was even the Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs. He was so excited that he was walking on air.A delicious dish of Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs would be extremely fragrant and the meat would be tangerine in color. The taste would be sour-sweet and would be crispy on the outside while remaining tender in the inside. As one bit down on it, the rich fragrance of the meat would create an aromatic explosion in their mouths and mesmerize them.The Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs was a dish that captivated people.Bu Fang endured the urge to immediately start cooking the Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs and checked the training method for the Meteor Cutting Technique instead. Strictly speaking, he was not an amateur when it came to handling knives. After all, he had been cooking for many years and had grasped his own set of cutting techniques.\u201cMeteor Cutting Technique training method: As a young man aiming to become the God of Cooking, you need to be superb with your cutting techniques. The cutting technique training mode will now be activated. Completing the daily cutting technique training will award you with cutting technique experience points and improve your cutting technique. When you master the Meteor Cutting Technique, your knife will be as swift as a meteorite as you precisely and perfectly cut any ingredient into equal pieces.\u201dBu Fang was startled, then the character panel naturally appeared in his mind.Host: Bu FangTrue Energy Cultivation Level: Third Grade (Has already achieved the ability to manifest true energy outside of the body. As the God of Cooking in the fantasy world, you will definitely need to make use of true energy when cooking. Work hard, young man.)Cooking Talents: Yet to be unlockedSkills: Level One Meteor Cutting Technique (0/100)Tools: Fragments of God of Cooking Set (3/4)God of Cooking overall rating: Apprentice Chef (You can finally cook ingredients with your true energy. Practice your cutting technique and the road to becoming the God of Cooking will open for you. Work hard, young man.)System Level: Three Stars (Conversion ratio is at twenty-five percent, customers are allowed to bring ingredients lower than fourth grade.)After Bu Fang finished reading the updated panel, he took a deep breath and exhaled to calm his agitation.As he lifted up his hand and exerted his will, he felt a snake-like burst of energy swiftly flowing through one of the meridians in his body and gushing out from his palm like a stream of white gas.Manifestation of true energy! That was the manifestation of true energy! Bu Fang\u2019s mouth was wide open in shock. He felt as if he was an expert in the novels and it felt unreal to him.In order to become a third grade Battle-Maniac, he needed the energy of a hundred crystals and he had earned five hundred crystals. The conversion ratio, when the system level was Two Stars, was at twenty percent. After conversion, the true energy he gained was worth a hundred crystals. Thus, he was able to break through and become a Battle-Maniac.Bu Fang had just become a second grade Battle-Master a few days ago, and now, he had just broken through once more. Even he found it to be slightly difficult to believe.If someone else was to witness this, they would be even more astonished.However, Bu Fang\u2019s astonishment did not last long and he quickly calmed down. He was different from the others. Even though his true energy level was at third grade, if he were to fight against Xiao Xiaolong, he would be easily defeated. That was to say that his cultivation level might be high, but his fighting prowess was worthless.\u201cHowever, so what if I am useless at fighting? I have Whitey,\u201d Bu Fang thought.\u201cSystem, how much true energy do I need to reach fourth grade?\u201d Bu Fang asked.\u201cFourth grade Battle-Spirit requires a thousand crystals. Fifth grade Battle-King requires ten thousand crystals. Sixth grade Battle-Emperor requires a hundred thousand crystals.\u201d the system solemnly replied to Bu Fang.Bu Fang clutched his chest as he resisted the urge to vomit blood\u2026 How frustrating! How many plates of egg-fried rice would he need to sell to get a hundred thousand crystals? It was definitely more than enough for him to sell until his old age.\u201cIt looks like my hopes of covertly acting conceited using my cultivation level in the future is dashed\u2026\u201d Bu Fang regretfully said with a sigh.\u201cIf a sixth grade Battle-Emperor needed a hundred thousand crystals, then a seventh grade Battle-Saint would need a million crystals\u2026 My heavens, a million crystals! If it was piled into a mountain, it could even crush me to death.\u201cIf I continue calculating, an eighth grade War-God\u2026 Good heavens!\u201dBu Fang shuddered and did not dare to continue thinking about it. He calmed down. Whatever seventh grade or eighth grade was something completely unrelated to him at this point. There was no need for him to think about it right now. Bu Fang felt that his current life was not bad.After the opening hours was over, Bu Fang immediately closed the store\u2019s entrance and headed into the kitchen to do some research on the tantalizing Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs.\u2026Great Hall of the imperial palace.The doors of the majestic Great Hall were wide open as row upon row of slim and beautiful court ladies entered while carrying delicious dishes into the hall.As the sound of the pipa[1] resounded in the air, the sound of the se[2] responded in kind.The scene within the Great Hall was filled with festivity.At the highest point in the Great Hall, the emperor was sitting on a gold-colored wooden zen chair[3]. The table in front of him was filled with delicious dishes while two beautiful court ladies were gently waving a fan.Seated below the emperor, on the left was the handsome and talented Great General Xiao Meng and the smiling crown prince, Ji Chengan. On the right was the second prince, King Yu, and the third prince, Ji Chengxue; the mood between the two princes was slightly cold and awkward.Further below them were the court officials of the Light Wind Empire and the prestigious guests invited to the feast.The family members of the Xiao and Ouyang families were seated together. Ouyang Xiaoyi was sitting next to Xiao Yanyu and was chatting with her.Xiao Xiaolong, on the other hand, was excitedly staring at a sapphire jar that was storing the wine, the Bejewelled Nectar.Like Xiao Xiaolong, the three barbarians of Ouyang were licking their lips as they stared at the wine jar.There was a similarity between the two families and that was the dishes in front of them, which were relatively untouched. It was a strange sight within the Great Hall.These dishes were all personally prepared by the imperial kitchen\u2019s chefs. The taste was definitely delicious and it could be said to be the most delicious food within the Light Wind Empire. However, the Xiao siblings and Ouyang siblings all stopped eating after they each took a single bite.\u201cThis dish tastes really bad. It\u2019s far worse than the smelly boss\u2019 food\u2026\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi said as she disdainfully used her chopsticks to play around with a piece of fish. She had no appetite at all.Even though the same disdainful look did not appear on Xiao Yanyu\u2019s beautiful face, there was no sign that her chopsticks were going to move. She was only calmly watching the scene within the Great Hall.\u201cThe only reason that we\u2019re here is for the Bejewelled Nectar Wine. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that Owner Bu\u2019s store doesn\u2019t have wine, I wouldn\u2019t even bother to come to the feast today. These dishes can\u2019t even compare to Owner Bu\u2019s Egg-Fried Rice!\u201d Xiao Xiaolong said with a sigh.When the three barbarians of Ouyang heard what he said, they fiercely nodded and Ouyang Zhen said, \u201cOwner Bu\u2019s Lees Fish is truly delicious, even people like us with bland taste buds were subdued!\u201d\u201cTch! You\u2019re just exaggerating. How could a lousy store like that have any delicious food?\u201d Zhao Ruge was just elegantly sitting nearby. When he heard the conservation, he immediately sneered at them.\u201cWhat are you laughing at! If I say it\u2019s delicious, then it\u2019s delicious!\u201d Ouyang Zhen said while angrily staring at Zhao Ruge.\u201cThe chefs of the imperial kitchen were personally selected by His Majesty from among famous chefs within the empire. They went through numerous strict screening to become an imperial chef. How could a mere chef from a restaurant in an alleyway compare to them? If you\u2019re praising him, are you suggesting that His Majesty is unable to discern talent?\u201d Zhao Ruge simply said.Even though Ouyang Xiaoyi felt that the smelly boss was a terrible person, she did not like it when someone said bad things about him. Her large eyes were staring at Zhao Ruge as she poutingly said, \u201cHave you eaten smelly boss\u2019 dishes? If you haven\u2019t eaten it before, then be quiet!\u201dZhao Ruge\u2019s expression froze and he felt as if an invisible arrow had pierced into his chest.\u201cThe next dish, the Bejewelled Nectar Wine!\u201dJust when Zhao Ruge was about to retaliate, the sharp voice of a eunuch resounded out. Then all of the guests started cheering as the climax of the feast finally arrived.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhao Ruge snorted, then pointed toward the sapphire jars that were stacked together and said, \u201cDo you see the Bejewelled Nectar Wine? Just this wine is enough to compare against all of the dishes in that entire restaurant!\u201dBejewelled Nectar Wine was the number one wine in the Light Wind Empire\u2026 He was that confident in it![1] Pipa(\u7435\u7436) \u2013 It is a Chinese string instrument that is also known as Chinese lute.[2] Se(\u9526) \u2013 It is a Chinese plucked zither.[3] Zen chair(\u7985\u6905) \u2013 It\u2019s a short wooden chair with a low back, where people would sit cross-legged on it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Is this Zhao Ruge an idiot? Does he really understand the smelly boss\u2019 restaurant? Even though the Bejewelled Nectar Wine was expensive, a jar was only five hundred gold coins. That\u2019s not even comparable to a plate of ordinary Egg-Fried Rice!\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi thought.\u201cOuyang Xiaoyi, did I say something wrong? How much could a store located in a godforsaken alleyway be worth anyway?\u201d Zhao Ruge said with a sneer as he ignored the loli\u2019s furious gaze.\u201cHmph! Your words just exposed the fact that you\u2019ve never tasted the smelly boss\u2019 dishes!\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi snorted and disdainfully turned her head. \u201cIf you had really tasted them, then you wouldn\u2019t have said that. You can try asking anyone who has tasted Owner Bu\u2019s dishes and see if their answer is as ignorant as yours.\u201d\u201cIgnorance isn\u2019t scary. What\u2019s scary is that you\u2019re acting conceited when you don\u2019t know anything!\u201dZhao Ruge\u2019s handsome face turned sour and was so exasperated that he almost vomited blood. How did he not realize before that this Ouyang Xiaoyi had such a venomous tongue! A loli with a venomous tongue would not be able to get married!When Xiao Yanyu and the rest saw the disgraced Zhao Ruge, they could not help but burst out laughing. This made Zhao Ruge\u2019s face turn ever more sour and he felt as if the entire world was laughing at him.And like he thought, Xiao Yanyu and the rest were laughing at his ignorance.\u201cYoung masters, this is the Bejewelled Nectar Wine bestowed by His Majesty. Please give it a taste.\u201d Several slim and beautiful court ladies with voices as soft as foam were carrying sapphire jars as they slowly approached each table and carefully poured out the wine.\u201cThe Bejewelled Nectar Wine is so in demand that even the imperial city is only supplied with two thousand jars each year at most. This time, His Majesty took out five hundred jars to celebrate General Xiao\u2019s victory. You people should properly taste such a fine wine that you would never be able to taste in that pathetic little store!\u201d Zhao Ruge lifted up the wine cup and sneered.Xiao Xiaolong and the three barbarians of Ouyang were already captivated by the appearance of the wine.\u201cHmph! Who told you that the smelly boss doesn\u2019t have any wine? He\u2019s brewing it right now!\u201d Now wanting to admit defeat, Ouyang Xiaoyi said.Zhao Ruge\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cOh, then let\u2019s have a wager. How about we bet whether the wine in that store can compare with the Bejewelled Nectar Wine?\u201d\u201cWager? Are you trying to bet with our little sister?!\u201d Before Ouyang Xiaoyi could accept the bet, the three barbarians of Ouyang were infuriated.The Ouyang family had always been paying close attention to the ideological education of their descendants and were especially strict with Ouyang Xiaoyi. Normally, they would be urging her to practice martial arts and embroidery to develop her into a virtuous, beautiful, intelligent, athletic young woman.\u201cThe first thing this Zhao Ruge mentioned was a wager; is he trying to misguide our little sister?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll accept your wager,\u201d the three barbarians of Ouyang were able to prevent Ouyang Xiaoyi from accepting the bet, but the quiet Xiao Yanyu suddenly opened her delicate, red lips and softly said.Everyone was shocked that the goddess, Xiao Yanyu, would accept the wager with Zhao Ruge.\u201cExcellent! And if the goddess loses, you will be accompanying me for moon-viewing aboard a boat for a night. How about it?\u201d Zhao Ruge was elated. He just realised that even the reserved and cool-headed Xiao Yanyu could be impulsive at times.Xiao Yanyu faintly smiled. Her beautiful face was as pretty as a picture and captivated anyone who was looking at her.\u201cFine, but if you lose, you\u2019ll give me a fifth grade Spirit Gathering Pill,\u201d Xiao Yanyu indifferently said. Her voice that was as beautiful as the song of birds sounded like thunder as it resounded in Zhao Ruge\u2019s ears.\u201cThis\u2026 A fifth grade Spirit Gathering Pill is a little\u2026\u201d Zhao Ruge was slightly hesitating. Honestly speaking, wagering a Spirit Gathering Pill was not something he could afford to do.\u201cYou bastard, you were so full of it when you were trying to wager with my sister. Now that the goddess is wagering with you, you\u2019re acting like a dog? Are you looking down on my sister or something?\u201d Ouyang Zhen shouted while pointing at Zhao Ruge.\u201cHe\u2019s afraid of losing,\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi said with a sneer as she crossed her arms across her chest.Lose? Would he really lose? Would the calculating Zhao Ruge, who devised a strategy to kill a fifth grade Battle-King\u2014when he was only a third grade Battle-Maniac\u2014really be afraid of losing\u2026 No, would he really lose?\u201cI accept! There\u2019s no way that kind of store would have any decent wine at all,\u201d Zhao Ruge said with a snort.\u2026As the celebration feast was ongoing in the Great Hall, Bu Fang was merrily sharpening his knife in the kitchen.He took out an ingredient prepared by the system from the freezer.The part of the boar used in the Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs was the meat near the spine. The spine would first be chopped into pieces and starch would be applied to it. Then, each piece would be deep fried in a wok filled with oil. Finally, a special sweet and sour sauce would be poured onto it to complete the dish.The prime rib placed on the chopping board was not the same as the one used in the Golden Shumai, the Flame Boar. The fat and tender ribs were filled with spirit energy and the marbling was clear like a piece of drawing. It was obviously not an ordinary piece of pork.\u201cThis pork comes from a fifth grade spirit beast that roams in Mount Tiandang, the Flying Cloud Boar. It was named for the white patches on its black fur that resembled clouds and its fast movement speed. The Flying Cloud Boar has strong and muscular thighs that taste terrible. However, the meat around the area of its spine is not only fresh and tender, but is filled with spirit energy as well. The quality of the meat is excellent.\u201d\u201cThe meat of a fifth grade spirit beast\u2026 This is very precious.\u201d Bu Fang\u2019s eyes lit up as he picked up a kitchen knife and tried to chop up the prime ribs. Surprisingly, the ribs remained intact and the rebound force even caused Bu Fang\u2019s arm to go numb.\u201cAs expected, the meat of a fifth grade spirit beast is truly extraordinary\u2026\u201d Bu Fang said with a sigh, then he continued to persevere in chopping and tenderizing the meat\u2026After separating the prime ribs into individual ribs, he placed them into starch paste that he had just prepared. The source of the starch paste was remarkable as well. It was made from a spirit potato found in the central wastelands of the Light Wind Empire.After all of the pieces of meat were coated in starch, Bu Fang began to prepare a wok filled with oil. He used a high quality oil to fill up half of the wok and waited for the temperature to rise.Holding his palm above the surface of the oil, he could feel the heat coming from it. When the heat was just hot enough to scald his hand, Bu Fang placed all of the starch-coated ribs into the wok.Pssst!As the pieces of meat were quickly turning within the oil, the starch on the exterior started to rapidly turn light yellow\u2026Bu Fang was using a long chopstick to constantly turn each piece of meat. He was skillfully ensuring that every single piece was being perfectly cooked to ensure they all had the same taste.As the starch on the exterior of every piece started to turn into a darker shade of yellow, Bu Fang scooped all of them up and placed them into a big pottery bowl. There was still oil seeping out from the starch on the surface.Bu Fang was experienced with making the sweet and sour sauce. The system had already prepared the needed ingredients and the amount used was left up to him.Very quickly, the tangerine sweet and sour sauce was prepared and the pieces of meat inside the big pottery bowl had also slightly cooled down. Even though there was still steam coming from them, oil had stopped seeping from the starch. He poured the sweet and sour sauce into the big pottery bowl, then stirred it for a while and was ready to place it on a plate.From pouring the sweet and sour sauce to lightly mixing the pieces of meat, the entire process should not exceed thirty seconds. This really tested Bu Fang\u2019s skills, as he needed to be fast to ensure that each piece was evenly coated with the sauce.Placing the pieces of meat onto the oval blue and white porcelain plate, a delicious, aromatic, tantalizing plate of Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs was completed.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euA sweet and sour fragrance was drifting in the air and was continuously rushing into his nasal cavities, making him unable to help but swallow his saliva.Grabbing a pair of bamboo chopsticks, Bu Fang carried the plate of Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs to the dining area. As he walked, the fragrance would constantly drift to his face, causing him to salivate and increasing his eagerness to taste the dish.The fragrance of the Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs was very rich and was a mixture of sweet, sour and meat.The big black dog lying at the entrance was sleeping, but its eyes suddenly opened. They were so bright that it was like a light bulb was turned on in the darkness. Within an instant, the dog disappeared into the store.And so, as Bu Fang was about to send a piece of Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs into his mouth, he realized that a pair of bright doggy eyes was staring at\u2026 the piece of meat clasped between his chopsticks.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Blacky, do you know how frightening it is when you suddenly appear like that?\u201d Bu Fang\u2019s hand trembled and almost dropped the piece of Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs.Blacky\u2019s tongue was hanging out of its mouth as it stared at Bu Fang.\u201cDo you want to eat this?\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly waved the piece of Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs around and Blacky cooperatively nodded its head with its tongue hanging out.Bu Fang\u2019s stiff face was unmoved as the corner of his mouth widened into a smile. Then he opened his mouth and shoved the fat and tender Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs into his mouth in one go.His entire mouth was bulging with the Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs as he started to bite down and chew. There was even some tangerine sweet and sour sauce stains on his lips.Blacky\u2019s eyes had been staring at that Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs. When it discovered Bu Fang was about to eat the piece of rib, its eyes turned dark and lost its will to continue living as it felt the entire sky was about to collapse.\u201cHow infuriating! This human is definitely doing this on purpose!\u201d Blacky thought.For the sake of that piece of rib, Blacky was enraged. Its hackles were raised as it bared its teeth while staring at Bu Fang.Bu Fang, at that moment, did not have the time to care about Blacky. The extremely good taste of the meat of the Flying Cloud Boar was bursting out from within his mouth. The rich fragrance of the meat was like a bomb as it instantly exploded and completely collapsed his taste buds.The perfectly-done sweet and sour sauce flawlessly mixed with high-grade pork was neither too sour nor too sweet.The texture of the meat was not hard and after a perfectly controlled deep-fry, it became appropriately crispy. The taste of the starch coating mixed with pork was extremely delicious.The pork used was the meat near the spine and had become soft and tender after Bu Fang had sufficiently tenderized it. There was even some crunchy cartilage mixed inside, which made creaking sounds when chewed and also slightly increased its tastiness.Bu Fang\u2019s eyes completely lit up as his chopsticks picked up another piece of Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs and shoved it into his mouth with lightning speed. His eyes were narrowed as he enjoyably chewed the ribs in his mouth while being captivated within the sea of fragrance.The big black dog was furious! It was shaking its tail as it paced around. Its doggy eyes were filled with conflict as it thought, \u201cShould I directly snatch the ribs from this foolish human?\u201cNo, what if this human refuses to feed this handsome dog later? This handsome dog\u2019s taste has already been spoiled by the foolish human\u2019s cooking!\u201cShould I snatch it? Or should I not snatch it?\u201d As the amount of Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs rapidly disappeared from the blue and white porcelain plate, Blacky felt as if its heart was constantly being emptied\u2026Finally, there was only a single piece left on the plate.Bu Fang\u2019s chopsticks had already slowly landed on that final piece of rib. As the chopsticks clamped onto the meat, the sweet and sour sauce coated on it splattered everywhere and filled the air with a fragrant scent.Blacky\u2019s eyes were almost filled with tears as it stared at the final piece!Bu Fang\u2019s mouth was still chewing; his expression was both comical and hilarious, and might be his most colorful expression ever.\u201cHere, take it. It looks like I am still too kind-hearted.\u201d Bu Fang simply said as he handed over the final piece to Blacky.Blacky was immediately overjoyed. Its doggy eyes were filled with an inexplicable light as it ate the piece of rib in one bite.The rich aroma of the meat bursted out within Blacky\u2019s mouth and its entire body shivered. With a face filled with pleasure, it lightly howled out.Bu Fang was dumbfounded\u2026 How did it turn from a dog into a wolf just by eating a piece of meat?After swallowing the piece of rib, Blacky was still slightly unsatisfied. However, that heinous Bu Fang had already finished all of the ribs. It could only helplessly return to the entrance and resume its sleep.Bu Fang leisurely cleaned up the plate and went to bed.The next morning, Bu Fang got out of bed early.He went into the kitchen after washing up. He specially got up earlier that day in order to practice the Meteor Cutting Technique mentioned by the system. From the sound of it, it seemed pretty impressive.The moment Bu Fang entered the kitchen, his line of sight was immediately attracted by a kitchen knife that was both thick and big.\u201cPlease slice a thousand radishes using this custom-made kitchen knife within an hour. Every single piece should be exactly the same. After finishing, you shall be awarded with ten points of Meteor Cutting Technique Proficiency,\u201d the system solemnly said.Slicing a thousand radishes within an hour and each piece had to be exactly the same\u2026 It was almost an impossible mission for an ordinary chef, but it was not that difficult for Bu Fang.However, when he grabbed the thick and big custom-made kitchen knife, his entire face darkened.The kitchen knife made from unknown materials was extremely heavy. When using a single hand, Bu Fang could only lift it up. It would be too difficult if he had to use this kitchen knife to complete the mission.\u201cSystem, are you deliberately making things difficult for me?\u201d Bu Fang asked the system with a cold expression.\u201cAs a young man aiming to become the God of Cooking, are you telling me that you can\u2019t take a little hardship? The road to becoming the God of Cooking isn\u2019t easy. Young man, you need to learn to endure hardships. The system thinks highly of you, work hard,\u201d the system seriously encouraged him, causing Bu Fang to be dumbfounded.He knew that arguing with the system was pointless, so he could only train according to the requirements.Retrieving a white and plump radish, Bu Fang lifted the kitchen knife and started to skillfully dice it. The radish was only an ordinary white radish, but the quality was extremely good and was both succulent and plump.After the first radish was done, Bu Fang expressionlessly grabbed the second one and immediately started dicing it. Since he had already started the training, then he would wholeheartedly engage in it. A cutting technique was actually a type of skill that needed attentiveness and paying attention was the only way to perfect the skill.And so, the sound of a kitchen knife colliding with a chopping board rang out from Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store since early in the morning.\u2026\u201cEh? Smelly boss didn\u2019t open the store for business today?\u201dAs Ouyang Xiaoyi and the rest arrived at Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store, they discovered that there was already a group of people queuing up at the entrance. Many of them were trying to peek into the store with faces filled with doubt.\u201cHmph! Don\u2019t tell me he found out about our wager and is afraid of opening for business?\u201d Zhao Ruge, dressed in white, was elegantly sneering.\u201cOwner Bu is afraid? Are you here to make jokes? You just have to obediently wait and hand over the fifth grade Spirit Gathering Pill to elder sister Yanyu!\u201d the little loli snorted in reply.The three barbarians of Ouyang and the Xiao siblings were there as well. They were also baffled by the fact that the store was not open for business yet.\u201cIt could be that Owner Bu was delayed by some matter.\u201d Xiao Yanyu gently said with her beautiful voice, \u201cLet\u2019s wait for a while.\u201dJust as her voice faded, the entrance of the store suddenly opened and Bu Fang expressionlessly appeared in front of their eyes.\u201cThe store is open for business,\u201d Bu Fang simply said, then turned around and went back in.There were only eight people in the queue and even after adding Zhao Ruge and the rest, there were only fifteen customers.Ouyang Xiaoyi eagerly ran in to help while taking the opportunity to conveniently inquire the smelly boss about the status of the wine brewing.\u201cEh? Smelly boss, why does your hand keep shaking?\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi curiously stared at Bu Fang\u2019s hand that was continuously twitching.Bu Fang glanced at her and simply said, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, it\u2019ll be fine after a while.\u201dHis hand was shaking because he had been slicing radishes with that heavy kitchen knife for over an hour\u2026 It would be shaking even if he had used an ordinary kitchen knife, not to mention that heavy custom-made kitchen knife.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSoon, the system manipulated a stream of gentle energy to flow into Bu Fang\u2019s arm, causing the numbness and the spasm to disappear.Fatty Jin and his buddies excitedly ordered their dishes and Xiaoyi did not immediately inform Bu Fang about the wager. After Fatty Jin and company were satisfied, it was finally the turn of Zhao Ruge and the rest who had just stepped into the store.As Zhao Ruge stepped into the store, he suddenly had an inexplicable urge to cry\u2026 He would finally be able to taste the store\u2019s dishes!\u201cSmelly boss, this fellow is wagering that your wine is inferior to the imperial palace\u2019s Bejewelled Nectar!\u201d As Zhao Ruge and the rest entered, Ouyang Xiaoyi loudly said to Bu Fang.Bu Fang was slightly startled, but then expressionlessly replied, \u201cBejewelled Nectar Wine\u2026 is nothing.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They were wine lovers and the Bejewelled Nectar Wine was the best wine they had ever tasted. However, when coming out of Bu Fang\u2019s mouth, it was\u2026 nothing?\u201cHaha! Smelly boss, the way you said it was really handsome!\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi happily exclaimed while clapping her hands. She liked the kind of self-confident feeling that Bu Fang had.\u201cTch, he\u2019s just a country bumpkin. Has he even tasted the Bejewelled Nectar Wine? He\u2019s only speaking nonsense.\u201d Zhao Ruge disdainfully snorted and pursed his lips. How could the owner of a little restaurant like Bu Fang know the taste of the number one wine in the Light Wind Empire that was personally picked out by the emperor from tens of thousands of wine?Bu Fang knitted his eyebrows and looked toward Zhao Ruge. He was very familiar with this fellow, only because Zhao Ruge had tried to bribe him with money over and over again.\u201cCompared to my wine\u2026 the other mundane wines are garbage.\u201dBu Fang simply said with bursting self-confidence. He was absolutely confident of the Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine.\u201cOwner Bu, you have wine here?\u201d Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s eyes lit up and a slight redness appeared on his fair face from agitation.Bu Fang just pointed toward the menu behind him and did not say anything.Everyone understood what he meant and turned their heads to look toward the menu\u2026\u201cSss~\u201dThis sound was made by Zhao Ruge. It was his first time stepping into the store and his first time seeing the menu. Even though he had heard much about the astronomical prices of the dishes, he still sucked in a breath of cold air when he personally saw the prices.Ouyang Xiaoyi and the rest immediately rolled their eyes at him. What a country bumpkin\u2026 Was there a need to act so surprised?\u201cIce Heart Jade Urn Wine, fifteen crystals per jar,\u201d Xiao Xiaolong softly read out.\u201cAs expected, Owner Bu\u2019s dishes are expensive as usual,\u201d Xiao Yanyu let out a beautiful exclamation. Fifteen crystals per jar of wine was far more expensive than the Bejewelled Nectar Wine, which only cost five hundred gold coins.With such a comparison between the two solely based on their prices, Bejewelled Nectar Wine was truly\u2026 nothing.\u201cFifteen crystals per jar? Have you gone crazy? Are you sure your wine is worth this price?\u201d Zhao Ruge could not believe it. Five hundred gold coins per jar for the Bejewelled Nectar Wine was already considered an astronomical price. Fifteen crystals\u2026 was practically insane!\u201cOwner Bu! There\u2019s no need to say anything else, I want a jar! Thankfully, my incredible foresight had already predicted that Owner Bu\u2019s wine would definitely not be cheap so I brought a lot of crystals,\u201d Xiao Xiaolong excitedly said toward Bu Fang.\u201cOwner Bu, the three of us want a jar as well! If the Lees Fish is already so delicious, then this wine is surely good as well!\u201d Ouyang Zhen carefreely said.Zhao Ruge raised his eyebrows as he looked toward Xiao Xiaolong and the three barbarians of Ouyang in surprise. They actually bought such an expensive wine\u2026 Could it be that the wine was really that good?Immediately, Zhao Ruge made up his mind. He gritted his teeth and said, \u201cI want a jar as well!\u201d\u201cHmph! I\u2019d like to see for what reason a wine from such a place could actually sell for fifteen crystals!\u201d Zhao Ruge thought.\u201cExcuse me, there\u2019s only three jars of Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine for sale per day. If you want to order it, you\u2019ll have to come again tomorrow,\u201d Bu Fang indifferently glanced toward Zhao Ruge and expressionlessly said.Zhao Ruge froze for a moment and his eyes were immediately filled with anger as he thought, \u201cYou\u2019re rejecting me again! Do you have a grudge against me?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that there are three jars per day? Since Xiao Xiaolong and the Ouyang brothers are buying two jars, isn\u2019t there one more jar left that you can sell to me? Are you looking down on me?\u201dZhao Ruge was infuriated.Facing the somewhat exasperated and furious Zhao Ruge, Bu Fang was slightly baffled and puzzled. However, his face was still indifferent as he replied, \u201cThe last jar is already reserved.\u201d\u201cReserved? An excuse\u2026 That\u2019s definitely an excuse!\u201d Zhao Ruge thought. Looking at that Bu Fang\u2018s expressionless face, he was tempted to throw his shoe at him. That face definitely deserved a beating!\u201cThen tell me, who reserved the third jar of wine? I\u2019ll go and throw money at him until he gives it up!\u201d Zhao Ruge said with a gloomy expression.\u201cOh, that\u2019s up to you. I don\u2019t care as long as you\u2019re not causing trouble within the store,\u201d Bu Fang simply said, then turned around and headed toward the kitchen. However, when he reached the entrance, he suddenly turned back and curiously asked, \u201cAre you not going to order other dishes? Are you only going to drink?\u201d\u201cI\u2019d like to have Golden Shumai,\u201d Xiao Yanyu softly said.Xiao Xiaolong was grinning as he ordered the improved Egg-Fried Rice. The three barbarians of Ouyang ordered a portion of Lees Fish as usual since that was the only dish they could taste.\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Bu Fang\u2019s gaze landed on Zhao Ruge.Zhao Ruge narrowed his eyes and said, \u201cGive me the Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs! If I am going to eat, I\u2019ll eat the most expensive dish!\u201dThe others were surprised and that was when they realized that there was actually a new dish on the menu. Their attentions were all attracted by the Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine just now.\u201cSweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs? Hmm, alright.\u201d Bu Fang nodded and went into the kitchen.The Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs, which cost fifty crystals, was the most expensive dish within the store so far.\u201cZhao Ruge, did you bring enough crystals?\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi could not help but ask. Even the princess of the Ouyang family was slightly shocked by the price of fifty crystals for a dish.\u201cI don\u2019t lack money, so what if it costs fifty crystals? You better not forget about our wager. Yanyu, just wait for our moon-viewing boat trip.\u201d Zhao Ruge confidently smiled. As the son of the Minister of the Left, he had his personal properties within the imperial city. Fifty crystals was truly nothing to him.Actually, when cultivators reached the level of fifth grade Battle-King, the crystals they needed for their cultivation were in the thousands. In order to achieve a breakthrough, they would even need to accumulate up to tens of thousands of crystals.That was the reason why crystals were nothing to higher level cultivators. Even though Zhao Ruge was not a high level cultivator, he had a lot of properties. There was also the fact that the target market for his businesses were cultivators, so he did not lack crystals.Zhao Ruge was faintly smiling as he sat down on a chair. He took out the sapphire jar, that contained the Bejewelled Nectar Wine, which he brought. He also brought his own wine cups and started to fill them. Then he beckoned toward Xiao Yanyu and the rest, and said, \u201cCome and sit down. Let\u2019s taste the Bejewelled Nectar Wine first.\u201dThere was a reason why the Bejewelled Nectar Wine was selected by the emperor to be the royal wine and was rated as the number one wine in the Light Wind Empire. As soon as the cups were filled, a rich wine aroma instantly diffused into the air.Xiao Xiaolong and the three barbarians of Ouyang were already close to losing their restraints on themselves.However, just when they were about to taste the Bejewelled Nectar Wine, a figure slowly stepped into the store. It was as if the composed footsteps were filled with a strange magic.Everyone\u2019s gaze was attracted by that figure at the entrance.Dressed in a black robe, he was carrying a longsword wrapped in a rag and wore a black-veiled bamboo hat. His tall and slim figure was exuding a mysterious aura.The moment that person stepped into the store, it seemed as if the atmosphere had turned slightly colder.The muscles on the three barbarians of Ouyang suddenly constricted as they alertly looked at the mysterious man wearing a bamboo hat. They could feel an extremely terrifying aura from him.The aura caused the true energy within their body to automatically circulate\u2026 That was the self-defense mechanism that occurs during a crisis.Xiao Yanyu and Xiao Xiaolong were startled for a moment and they started to closely watch the man as well. They felt the gaze behind the black veil seemed to have landed on them.\u201cWho are you?!\u201d Zhao Ruge knitted his eyebrows and coldly asked. He felt that the man was slightly strange.With the current unstable situation within the imperial city, many experts from the sects were hiding within. Perhaps\u2026 this man was an expert from the sects as well.\u201cMe? I am just a diner.\u201d A hoarse voice like sandpaper rang out. The mysterious man directly sat down at the table near the entrance and placed the longsword wrapped in a rag onto the table.The rag was slightly decrepit and had lost its color and become stiff after numerous washing.\u201cYou\u2026 What are you ordering?\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi shyly asked. She was frightened by the man\u2019s aura.\u201cI reserved a jar of Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine from Owner Bu yesterday. I am specially here today to retrieve the wine,\u201d the man continued to speak using a hoarse voice.\u201cRetrieve the wine?!\u201dEveryone was surprised for a moment, then weirdly looked toward Zhao Ruge. That fellow seemed to had said that he would throw money to buy the last jar of Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine from the person who reserved it.Zhao Ruge was startled, then the corner of his mouth curled up. He elegantly sat down opposite to the man and confidently said, \u201cSell the Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine to me. I\u2019ll give you three times the price.\u201d\u201cI am not selling,\u201d the man indifferently replied.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhao Ruge frowned and continued to say, \u201cFive times the price.\u201d\u201cI said, I am not selling.\u201d\u201cDo you know who I am? Are you trying to offend me?\u201d Zhao Ruge threatened with a cold expression. After his two consecutive offers were rejected, Zhao Ruge was furious as well.Finally, the man seemed to lift his gaze and look at Zhao Ruge. His hoarse voice, as alarming as the sound of thunder, sounded out.\u201cEven if the Minister of the Left was here, he wouldn\u2019t dare to speak to me that way. Who\u2026 do you think you are?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Still, they all felt that this mysterious man was too arrogant.Who was the Minister of the Left? As an important official within the imperial city, his status was comparable to General Xiao Meng. However, this man\u2019s tone was filled with contempt toward the Minister of the Left. It was uncertain whether he was really that confident or was deliberately arrogant.Zhao Ruge\u2019s eyes brightly lit up as his aura rapidly increased. The stream of energy was like bugs crawling on his skin as he swiftly gathered true energy.\u201cYou\u2019re noisy! Since you\u2019re here in Owner Bu\u2019s place, then you should be peacefully eating. If you want to fight, then get out of here,\u201d the mysterious man indifferently said. He did not care about Zhao Ruge who was gathering his aura in the slightest.As the man finished speaking, he held out his hand with his thumb and index finger together, as if he was going to flick away a fly.Buzz!The three barbarians of Ouyang who were sitting at a distance immediately moved in front of Ouyang Xiaoyi. Their hairs were standing on ends as they gravely looked toward the mysterious man.Xiao Yanyu\u2019s pupils constricted as well and she subconsciously gathered the true energy within her body.Chi chi!!With a flick of the man\u2019s finger, a stream of invisible energy swiftly burst out. Zhao Ruge\u2019s body froze for a moment, then the aura that surrounded him started shrivelling like a deflated balloon.With a groan, he fell face forward to the ground\u2026Zhao Ruge went into a daze as his entire body shivered and his lips trembled. It was too terrifying\u2026 Within that instant, Zhao Ruge thought he was going to die!A red dot instantly appeared in the center of his forehead, then rapidly grew to cover his entire forehead.\u201cIf we were not in Owner Bu\u2019s store right now, you would\u2019ve already become a corpse by now,\u201d the mysterious man indifferently said as he slowly retracted his arm and became silent.The mood within the store instantly became cold and everyone held their breath.Zhao Ruge had an unsightly expression on his face as he climbed up from the ground, then miserably returned to his seat and quietly sat down.The three barbarians of Ouyang were pulling Ouyang Xiaoyi away to a safe distance as well. From the scariness of the mysterious man\u2019s attack, they could tell that he was at least a fifth grade Battle-King.However, that was still a conservative estimate. After all, Zhao Ruge was a third grade Battle-Maniac that was close to becoming a fourth grade Battle-Spirit. Even an ordinary Battle-King would have some difficulty in instantly killing him. Which meant that this man might be a sixth grade Battle-Emperor!As the awkward mood within the store seemed to stretch on forever, a rich fragrance drifted out from the kitchen.\u201cThe improved Egg-Fried Rice is ready,\u201d Bu Fang\u2019s indifferent voice sounded out from within the kitchen. A bowl of Egg-Fried Rice that appeared to be radiating a golden brilliance was placed at the window.Ouyang Xiaoyi eagerly walked over to collect the food.The rich fragrance filled with warmth seemed to disperse much of the cold atmosphere within the store. The delicious smell, that was like a piece of silk gliding across their faces, made them feel as if their hearts were being teased.\u201cIt smells good!\u201d As Zhao Ruge sniffed the fragrance, he felt as if the swelling pain on his forehead had mostly receded.Xiao Xiaolong cheerfully received the Egg-Fried Rice while holding a blue and white porcelain spoon in his hand and began to gobble down the food.Zhao Ruge swallowed a mouthful of saliva. He had never tasted the Egg-Fried Rice before, but his stomach was rumbling just from smelling the fragrance.Xiao Xiaolong was eating so messily that there was even rice grains at the corners of his mouth. When he felt a gaze filled with burning desire, he immediately grinned at Zhao Ruge and asked, \u201cDo you want to give it a try?\u201dZhao Ruge looked at him and subtly nodded.\u201cIf you want to try it, then buy it yourself next time.\u201d Xiao Xiaolong stuck his tongue out, licked the rice grains off the corner of his mouth and teasingly said.Zhao Ruge immediately froze and his eyes were filled with anger as he thought, \u201cHow dare he make fun of me!\u201d\u201cThe Golden Shumai is ready.\u201d Bu Fang\u2019s indifferent voice sounded out once more.Subsequently, the Golden Shumai was collected by Ouyang Xiaoyi and placed in front of Xiao Yanyu. The exceptionally beautiful Golden Shumai was as delicate as a piece of artwork and so bright that it was practically radiating golden rays.As Xiao Yanyu picked up a shumai with a pair of bamboo chopsticks, the soup seeped out and instantly released a captivating fragrance.Before the soup dribbled off the shumai, Xiao Yanyu caught it with her mouth. Her delicate lips became even more enticing as a layer of glistening oil covered her lips.Zhao Ruge\u2019s eyes were almost completely mystified at this point. No one could be sure whether he was looking at the delicious food or the beautiful woman, but\u2026 it was clear that the scene before him was a feast for the eyes.After that, the time between each dish getting served became even shorter.The Lees Fish was ready to be served as well. As the dish was too heavy for Xiaoyi, Bu Fang had to personally serve it. When he entered the dining area, he was slightly startled to see the mysterious man wearing the bamboo hat.The mysterious man nodded at Bu Fang and he expressionlessly nodded in response as well.As the Lees Fish appeared, the rich wine aroma almost overpowered the fragrance of all the other dishes. Even the eyes of the mysterious man slightly lit up and gave the Lees Fish a longer look.\u201cFrom the looks of it\u2026 it seems pretty good,\u201d the man thought to himself. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize that other than having wine of the highest grade, Owner Bu\u2019s dishes were first grade as well.\u201d\u201cSweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs is ready.\u201d A short while after returning to the kitchen, Bu Fang\u2019s voice sounded out from it.Ouyang Xiaoyi was already impatiently waiting at the window. She was looking forward to Bu Fang\u2019s latest dish.When the tangerine and fragrant Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs appeared in front of Ouyang Xiaoyi, she was completely stunned. Just from sniffing the smell, she was involuntarily gulping and almost started drooling.It was too aromatic! Furthermore, the sweet and sour fragrance was teasing the little loli to the point of losing her self-control.Unfortunately\u2026 The one who ordered the dish was that sissy, Zhao Ruge!As she unwillingly served the dish to Zhao Ruge, the latter was already drooling while holding a pair of bamboo chopsticks in his hand. The fragrance of the Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs was so aromatic that he was almost captivated to the point of being inextricable.As he picked up a piece of rib with his chopsticks and put it in his mouth, a sweet and sour flavor instantly burst out. The rich flavor of the meat violently surged and enveloped his taste buds while assaulting his mouth. The rib was still slightly hot and he could not help but pant to cool it down.The rich fragrance of the meat immediately enveloped the entire store.Even Xiao Xiaolong stopped eating and Xiao Yanyu looked toward Zhao Ruge as well\u2026 It was truly too fragrant!Zhao Ruge was so happy that he almost shed tears. It was really extremely delicious. He felt that the fifty crystals were really well spent!He rapidly picked up another piece and shoved it into his mouth as Ouyang Xiaoyi enviously watched. The sweet and sour sauce splattered and stained the corners of his mouth. He was panting as he ate the meat.At that moment, Bu Fang walked out of the kitchen. All of the dishes were cooked and only the Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine was left.He carried out two jars of Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine and separately placed them in front of Xiao Xiaolong and the three barbarians of Ouyang. Then he returned to the kitchen, took out another jar and placed it on the table of the mysterious man.\u201cHere\u2019s your Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine, please enjoy your drink,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly said.\u201cHah\u2026 Owner\u2026 Is your\u2026 hah\u2026 wine really better than\u2026 the Bejewelled Nectar Wine?\u201d Zhao Ruge asked doubtfully while panting. He was still chewing a piece of rib that was emitting heat in his mouth.\u201cI already said\u2026 That whatever Bejewelled Nectar Wine is nothing. You just have to taste my wine and you\u2019ll know,\u201d Bu Fang simply said.The mysterious man\u2019s hoarse voice sounded out as well, \u201cHow is Bejewelled Nectar Wine even comparable to Owner Bu\u2019s Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine? The number one wine in Light Wind Empire is definitely Owner Bu\u2019s Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter the man finished speaking, he removed the cloth cover of the wine jar. Within that instant, a mellow and rich wine aroma drifted into the air and engulfed the store.The aroma of the wine was extraordinarily mellow and concentrated. It completely dispersed the aroma of the Lees Fish and captivated everyone in the area.A captivating redness appeared on both the fair faces of Ouyang Xiaoyi and Xiao Yanyu.Just from comparing the aroma, the Bejewelled Nectar Wine had already lost.As for the taste\u2026 Xiao Xiaolong and the three barbarians of Ouyang were already eager to savor it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In front of this wine aroma, he seemed to have completely forgotten about the taste of the Bejewelled Nectar Wine which he praised as the best.Xiao Xiaolong eagerly tore off the cloth cover of the wine jar and poured the wine into a cup as the pristine liquid created a swaying reflection. The wine aroma penetrated deep into his soul and he was involuntarily intoxicated as he deeply inhaled.Picking up the wine cup, Xiao Xiaolong contentedly lifted it to his nose. As he sniffed the wine, his face was filled with an enjoyable expression. To a wine lover, a cup of fine wine was not inferior to the most beautiful woman in the world. They would let go of all of their vigilance and devote themselves to enjoying the taste of the wine.As the liquid entered his mouth, it felt like ice crystals brushing against his tongue as it flowed down his throat into his stomach. The coolness that it emitted made all the hairs on Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s body stand on ends and goosebumps appeared all over.In the split second when the wine entered his stomach, it was like there was a fire burning within his body. The warm feeling instantly gushed to the pit of his stomach, immersing Xiao Xiaolong in the coalesce of ice and fire.\u201cOh~\u201d Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s face was flushing red and had uncontrollably moaned just from a single sip.\u201cWhat a fine wine! It truly is a fine wine!\u201d Xiao Xiaolong repeatedly praised. He poured the rest of the wine in the cup into his mouth and his eyes narrowed as if he had entered into a euphoric state.When the three barbarians of Ouyang saw his behavior, they were unable to endure any further. The three of them filled their own wine cups and poured the wine into their mouths as well.Within an instant, their eyes widened in surprise as all of the pores on their bodies relaxedly spread open and they felt a sense of happiness they never experienced before.The three of them did not say anything and concentrated solely on drinking the wine. They were completely immersed in the rich mellowness of the Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine.The mysterious man wearing the bamboo hat seemed to be faintly smiling as he watched their reactions. He took off his bamboo hat and revealed a handsome face that seemed to have been sculpted from marble.Filling his cup as well, he was enjoying the wine by himself with an extremely satisfied expression on his face.\u201cIs the wine\u2026 really that good?\u201d Zhao Ruge was skeptical. Even though his confidence was wavering under the impact of the rich aroma of the wine, he was still hoping that it was all just a facade when he recalled the outcome of losing the wager.\u201cThey\u2019re definitely pretending\u2026\u201d Zhao Ruge was starting to lose confidence.If he had not tasted any of Bu Fang\u2019s dishes before, he might still have some confidence. However, after tasting the Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs, he already completely knew that Bu Fang\u2019s culinary skills were very strong.\u201cXiaolong, fill a cup for young master Zhao and fill a cup for me as well,\u201d Xiao Yanyu gently said.Xiao Xiaolong was slightly startled as he sobered up from his captivated state, but he was slightly reluctant to obey his sister. There was barely enough wine for himself from the start and he still had to share with that sissy, Zhao Ruge\u2026 It was a huge loss for him!The three barbarians of Ouyang were fast drinkers and had already finished the entire jar in a short while. Ouyang Di was even shaking the jar in his hands to try getting one last drop of wine.Without even a single drop left, the three of them helplessly looked toward Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s wine jar.Xiao Xiaolong glared at the three of them and quickly hugged the wine jar in his arms. He first poured a cup for his sister, then poured another for Zhao Ruge and said, \u201cSissy Zhao, after drinking this cup, you should just obediently admit your loss and hand over the Spirit Gathering Pill to my sister. Since you\u2019ve agreed to the wager, you should be willing to pay up!\u201d\u201cI, I haven\u2019t lost yet\u2026\u201d Zhao Ruge\u2019s voice was getting weaker. He was in a daze as he looked at the pristine cup of wine. Then he lifted up the cup and sipped from it.Xiao Yanyu lifted up the cup as well and lightly sipped from it while covering the view with her other hand.As the small mouthful of wine entered her stomach, Xiao Yanyu\u2019s skin that was fairer than snow instantly became blushing red and a slight redness even appeared on her fair cheeks; her appearance was extremely adorable.Zhao Ruge already had nothing to say. After tasting the Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine and drinking the Bejewelled Nectar Wine again, the latter was as tasteless as plain water. There was too much difference between the two.The Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine was the true number one wine within the Light Wind Empire.After finishing the wine in his cup, Zhao Ruge had a painful expression on his face. He already understood that he lost the wager.He had no choice but to hand over the fifth grade Spirit Gathering Pill.He was originally planning to use this Spirit Gathering Pill to advance to fourth grade Battle-Spirit. However, he did not expect that he would actually lose it. Without the Spirit Gathering Pill, his breakthrough was far away once more.Receiving the jade bottle that Zhao Ruge handed to her, Xiao Yanyu was extremely beautiful as she faintly smiled. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for young master Zhao to be upset. Even though you\u2019ve lost a Spirit Gathering Pill, you were able to eat Owner Bu\u2019s Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs. It was not a loss for you.\u201dIt was not a loss? How could that be possible? The Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs could only fulfill his tongue\u2019s desires, but the Spirit Gathering Pill was able to help him advance his cultivation level. Comparing the two, it was a huge loss for him! Unless\u2026 Owner Bu\u2019s Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs could help him achieve a breakthrough as well. However\u2026 how could that be possible?Zhao Ruge was so heartbroken that he had difficulty breathing and had an extremely unsightly expression on his face.Xiao Yanyu only smiled at that. How could a serving of Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs cost fifty crystals just because the taste was good? If the improved Egg-Fried Rice could increase true energy within the body, then this Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs would evidently be more effective. Zhao Ruge would soon experience that fact.When that moment came, he would understand Owner Bu\u2019s true abilities.On the other side, Xiao Xiaolong had also finished his Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine. He was slightly intoxicated and a slight redness had appeared on his face that was as tender as a woman\u2019s.The three barbarians of Ouyang were still fine. Even though the Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine was really mellow, their cultivation levels were high and they were experienced drinkers. Their reactions were not as intense compared to Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s.Bada!The crisp sound of a cup falling onto the table was not loud, but slightly startled everyone.They all looked toward the source of the noise, Xiao Yanyu.Xiao Yanyu\u2019s expression, which was still gentle a moment ago, had suddenly turned slightly ferocious and grim. Her gaze was transfixed by the figure at a distance.Xiao Xiaolong was not that intoxicated in the first place. When he noticed his sister\u2019s expression, his tipsiness mostly dispersed. He followed her gaze toward the figure sitting at the table near the entrance.That charming and elegant face that seemed to have been sculpted from marble\u2026\u201cWhy is it you!\u201d Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s eyes widened as he practically roared out.Bu Fang, who was resting nearby, was immediately startled as he baffledly looked at Xiao Xiaolong. He did not seem to understand why the sissy suddenly became so angry.\u201cWhy can\u2019t it be me?\u201d The hoarse voice that was like sandpaper resounded around the store, containing a trace of coldness.Zhao Ruge and the rest saw that handsome face as well and went into a daze. Then their expressions all changed into one filled with incredulity.\u201cYou still dare to show up within the capital\u2026 Aren\u2019t you afraid that father would find out about your location?\u201cMy precious brother,\u201d Xiao Yanyu coldly said. Her voice that was like the song of birds contained a trace of killing intent.Xiao Xiaolong was already at his limit as he stood up and true energy surged out of his body.\u201cHeart-rending Sword Monarch Xiao Yue! He actually dared to appear within the imperial city\u2026 Is he seeking death?!\u201d Zhao Ruge and the rest were filled with astonishment.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euXiao Yue, the eldest son of Xiao Meng, was astonishingly talented. At the age of ten, he had already become first grade and reached second grade by the time he was eleven years old. He was able to manifest true energy when he was thirteen and became Battle-Spirit at the age of fifteen. He became the youngest fifth grade Battle-King in the history of the Light Wind Empire at the age of eighteen. His future was looking bright.However, tragedy struck three years ago when Xiao Yue became enthralled with the way of the sword and joined the Void Sword Pavilion. In order to become the master of a sword spirit of Void Sword Pavilion, he even used the blood from his mother\u2019s heart as an offering. With a single sword strike to her heart, he sent his mother into a comatose state from which she had yet to awaken.Xiao Yue was then beaten by the furious Xiao Meng to the point where he was vomiting blood and the true energy within his body had dissipated. In the end, he was rescued by the combined efforts of the three elders of Void Sword Pavilion. From then on, Xiao Yue deserted the Xiao family and became an enemy that they swore to kill.Xiao Yanyu and Xiao Xiaolong could never forget the day when their mother had collapsed in front of them. Her blood splatter had dyed their eyes red and turned into an unforgettable hatred for them; a hatred toward Xiao Yue.From that moment onward, Xiao Yue was not their beloved and esteemed elder brother any longer.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Then the distinct sound of someone drinking down the cup of wine in one go and the liquor being swallowed.Xiao Yue lightly breathed out as he finally finished the jar of Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine by himself. He acknowledged the fact that the wine was of the highest quality and was far more delicious than the Bejewelled Nectar Wine.\u201cOwner Bu, I am leaving. I will reserve a jar of Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine for tomorrow as well,\u201d Xiao Yue said to Bu Fang as he placed fifteen crystals onto the table. Then with a gentle smile, he put on his bamboo hat and slinged the sword wrapped in a rag behind his back.\u201cHmm, alright,\u201d Bu Fang nodded.\u201cXiao Yue! Are you just going to leave like this?!\u201d Xiao Yanyu\u2019s voice rang out. It was no longer like the song of birds, but a slight mixture of anger and killing intent.Xiao Yue\u2019s figure, who had already reached the entrance, paused for a moment and turned around. His handsome face was concealed by the black veil of the bamboo hat and could not be seen clearly.\u201cWhat about it? Do you think you can make me stay?\u201d There was a hint of mockery in Xiao Yue\u2019s hoarse voice. That disdainful tone caused Xiao Yanyu\u2019s pupils to slightly constrict as anger covered her beautiful face.Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s temper was even worse than Xiao Yanyu\u2019s and he was unable to endure it any further. He gathered his true energy and charged toward Xiao Yue.\u201cAh! You bastard!\u201d Xiao Xiaolong howled with bloodshot eyes as he swung his fist with a powerful force.Bang!Xiao Yue calmly lifted his hand and caught Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s fist with his palm. However, despite Xiao Xiaolong putting in so much force, Xiao Yue\u2019s hand did not budge in the slightest.\u201cThird grade Battle-Maniac? Your talent is still quite inferior compared to your elder sister.\u201d Xiao Yue lightly smiled as a powerful force burst out from his palm. The wave of energy scattered in all directions and sent Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s body flying.Xiao Yanyu caught Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s body in mid-air and her expression had already turned frosty.Zhao Ruge was staring at Xiao Yue while his eyes were flashing. On the other hand, the three barbarians of Ouyang were standing in a distance and shaking their heads while sighing\u2026 They could not and dare not interfere in the Xiao family\u2019s affairs.After placing Xiao Xiaolong down, Xiao Yanyu\u2019s eyes seemed to become empty as her hair, propelled by a force, began to hover in the air.Ever since that incident three years ago, she had been diligently cultivating day after day for this moment. She did it so that she could personally execute the brute that sent their mother into a coma.A pale green dot appeared on her flawless forehead and began to spread as pale green lines gradually covered her beautiful face.\u201cWood Mist Technique? You actually learned this type of secret technique that depletes your life force\u2026 It seems that you really hate me.\u201dXiao Yue\u2019s expression underneath the bamboo hat could not be seen as his hoarse voice resounded around the store.Zhao Ruge\u2019s pupils constricted as he thought, \u201cWood Mist Technique, that\u2019s a terrifying technique that converts life force into a tremendous power! Its users can even challenge higher level opponents! Xiao Yanyu actually learned such a technique, what a mad woman!\u201d\u201cXiao Yue, it\u2019s time for you to die!\u201d The current Xiao Yanyu was cold and ruthless, and each of her words were as cold as ice.However, just when she was about to make a move, a slender hand suddenly landed on her shoulder and an indifferent voice rang out from behind her.\u201cExcuse me, but creating a disturbance is prohibited within the store. If you want to fight, please do it outside. Thank you.\u201dEveryone was startled as they looked at Bu Fang\u2014whose hand was still on Xiao Yanyu\u2019s shoulder \u2014with odd expressions on their faces. This fellow\u2026 Was he not afraid of death?With such a grim mood that anyone could detect the murderous intent, it was obvious that a fierce battle was about to occur. What was a third grade Battle-Maniac doing over there?Xiao Yanyu\u2019s dark green pupils slightly moved and her cold gaze focused on Bu Fang\u2019s expressionless face.\u201cAre you going to get in my way?\u201d Her voice was as cold as ice mountains and cold winds and would cause any listeners to shiver. Even Bu Fang slightly frowned when he heard her. He stared at the dark green dot on Xiao Yanyu\u2019s forehead and could feel a vigorous life force bubbling within.Hum!A powerful force knocked away Bu Fang\u2019s arm as Xiao Yanyu ignored him and took a step forward. Her toes lightly tapped the ground and her figure swiftly glided toward Xiao Yue.Bu Fang took a step backward and lightly called out, \u201cWhitey.\u201dAs Whitey appeared next to him with its big belly, Bu Fang patted Whitey\u2019s belly and said, \u201cStop them.\u201dXiao Bai\u2019s mechanical eyes flashed, then it disappeared from where it stood and instantly reappeared next to Xiao Yanyu.\u201cGet out of my way!\u201d Xiao Yanyu\u2019s face suddenly turned ferocious as she flung out a burst of true energy from her hand toward Whitey who was blocking her way. She had already set her mind on killing Xiao Yue that day, so there was no one who could stop her!Whitey\u2019s mechanical eyes slightly flashed red and it lifted up its hand.Bang bang!Ignoring the burst of true energy, Whitey\u2019s hand landed on Xiao Yanyu\u2019s body, jarring her entire body. Xiao Yanyu was flung backward as she miserably landed next to Xiao Xiaolong. The dark green dot on her forehead made a crisp sound as it immediately shattered into many pieces like glass.Her secret technique was actually dispelled by a single palm strike from Whitey!Xiao Yue narrowed his eyes as he gravely looked toward Whitey. He thought, \u201cThis puppet is slightly interesting. To be able to dispel Xiao Yanyu\u2019s technique with a single palm strike, it should be quite strong.\u201d\u201cOwner Bu, I am leaving. Don\u2019t forget to keep a jar of Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine for me,\u201d Xiao Yue lightly smiled as he said toward Bu Fang. Then he turned around and disappeared within the chilly alleyway.\u201cTroublemaker, you will be stripped as an example to others.\u201d As Xiao Yue disappeared, Whitey\u2019s mechanical voice rang out and startled everyone.\u201cOwner Bu, my sister didn\u2019t cause trouble! She really didn\u2019t\u2026 Wasn\u2019t she stopped before she could reach the other party?\u201d Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s expression slightly changed as he quickly hugged Xiao Yanyu\u2019s body and anxiously said to Bu Fang.What a joke! How could Xiao Xiaolong allow others to strip his sister and throw her out? It would not just simply end with a clamor, an earthquake might even occur within the imperial city.Bu Fang slightly hesitated as he felt that Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s words seemed to hold water.\u201cThe other party\u2019s secret technique being dispelled has led to a severe loss of life force and resulted in a life endangering situation. Considering that Whitey injured Xiao Yanyu due to the host\u2019s incitement, an abrupt mission shall be issued.\u201cAbrupt Mission: The host has to learn \u2018Elixir Cuisine\u2019, the cooking method of Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup, within three days and rescue the life of a dying beauty.\u201d(Since ancient times, the fate of beautiful women end in misery. Young man, use your nimble hands to rescue her.)Mission Reward: Oyster Bun that may be ordered to take out.The system\u2019s solemn voice suddenly rang out in Bu Fang\u2019s mind, causing him to space out.Abrupt mission? Rescue the beauty?\u201cThe rule was set by the system!\u201d Bu Fang was slightly dumbfounded as the corner of his mouth twitched.\u201cAfter analysis, it is concluded that Xiao Yanyu\u2019s actions was not severe enough to be considered as causing trouble,\u201d the system seriously replied.Bu Fang felt as if his chest was pierced by an invisible arrow\u2026\u201cFine, this style of conducting business is indeed how the system behaves.\u201d\u201cOwner Bu! My sister\u2026 She\u2026 What\u2019s wrong with her!\u201d Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s horrified voice pulled Bu Fang back into reality.Bu Fang walked toward Xiao Yanyu. Her face was pale and her rosy lips had lost its luster. It was as if her life energy was rapidly depleting.The system was indeed not lying to him. She was in a life endangering situation after receiving the blow from Whitey.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. She\u2019s only suffering from an ordinary loss of life force. There\u2019s always a few days in a month when people experience this. Bring her back here in three days and I\u2019ll prepare a medicinal cuisine for her. She\u2019ll recover once she eats it,\u201d Bu Fang simply said as he expressionlessly concealed his guilty conscience.Xiao Xiaolong and the rest were stunned. They thought, \u201cIs\u2026 it really alright? There isn\u2019t even any color on her face!\u201d\u201cTrust me, it\u2019s alright. However, remember to bring her back in three days,\u201d Bu Fang earnestly exhorted.\u201cYoung master Xiao, you should bring young lady Yanyu back to the manor and let General Xiao look at her first. With the general\u2019s abilities, he should be able to treat her,\u201d the three barbarians of Ouyang reminded Xiao Xiaolong.Xiao Xiaolong was immediately woken up by the reminder and hastily exited the store with Xiao Yanyu in his arms.Zhao Ruge and the rest left as well. The incident that day had quite a huge impact on them.The fact that the Heart-rending Sword Monarch had appeared within the imperial city was an important information. After all, such a dangerous character had appeared in a sensitive period.\u201cSmelly boss, is elder sister Yanyu really alright?\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi doubtfully looked up at Bu Fang and asked.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cShe\u2019s alright. Be a good girl and go back first,\u201d Bu Fang said as he stroked Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s head.Once everyone had left, Bu Fang closed up the store and ended the business for the day.\u201cSystem, what will happen if I don\u2019t manage to learn how to cook the Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup within three days?\u201d Bu Fang quietly asked the system.The system solemnly replied, \u201cThere\u2019s a ninety-nine percent chance that the host would be torn into pieces by the furious seventh grade Battle-Saint Xiao Meng.\u201d\u201cUh, system, for the sake of rescuing a beauty still experiencing the prime of her life, I will work hard! Hurry up and tell me how to cook the medicinal cuisine! Hurry!\u201d Bu Fang announced in a righteous tone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was afraid that his father would say the words he feared the most.Xiao Yanyu\u2019s beautiful face was extremely pale and her lively eyes had become spiritless. Underneath her pasty skin, there was a black vein roaming about as her life force continued to deplete.The burly Xiao Meng was gloomily standing next to Xiao Yanyu. As he slowly withdrew the true energy used to examine her, his dashing eyebrows were knitted together and were almost touching. A trace of killing intent, deeply hidden in his eyes, was starting to stir.\u201cWho did this?! How did Yanyu become like this?\u201d Xiao Meng coldly asked, suppressing his anger as he spoke.\u201cWe\u2026 went to Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store and met\u2026 met elder brother.\u201d Xiao Xiaolong was slightly trembling and had some difficulty breathing due to Xiao Meng\u2019s intimidation. A seventh grade Battle-Saint\u2019s fury was not something that an ordinary person could endure.Xiao Meng turned his head and attentively looked toward him. \u201cWho did you say you met? Xiao Yue?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201d\u201cSo, he\u2019s the one who injured Yanyu?\u201d Xiao Meng gritted his teeth and coldly asked. His fists were tightly clenched together as he suppressed his boundless fury.Xiao Xiaolong was startled and he quickly denied it. Subsequently, he conveyed everything that happened within the store to Xiao Meng.\u201cYou\u2019re saying that Yanyu was injured by the store\u2019s puppet?\u201d There was no expression on Xiao Meng\u2019s face, but Xiao Xiaolong was even more frightened now. He knew that the type of anger that was not shown was the most terrifying.\u201cThe owner said\u2026 he can save elder sister three days from now,\u201d Xiao Xiaolong said.\u201cAnd you actually believed him? You\u2019re letting someone of unknown background dictate your elder sister\u2019s life?\u201d Xiao Meng coldly smiled as he glanced at Xiao Xiaolong, causing him to feel as if he was plunged into icy waters.\u201cGo back first. I\u2019ve already invited the imperial physicians over. Hopefully, they\u2019ll be able to save your elder sister.\u201d Xiao Meng tiredly beckoned the dejected Xiao Xiaolong to leave.After Xiaolong left, Xiao Meng ordered the servants to bring Xiao Yanyu back to her room and he disappeared from the spot after taking a step.\u201cI\u2019d like to see what kind of person would dare to injure my daughter,\u201d Xiao Meng\u2019s gloomy voice resounded.\u2026Under the night sky, Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store seemed a little tranquil. The alleyway was deep and quiet, and light was seeping out from the gaps between the tightly shut door boards.The big black dog was lazily lying at the entrance with its eyes closed, maintaining its immutable sleeping position as if sleep was the dog\u2019s greatest hobby.\u201cHmm?\u201d The eyes of the big black dog that were shut tight suddenly quivered, then slightly opened and puzzledly looked toward an empty space.It saw a figure striding in the air and approaching Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store with a solemn expression. The aura coming from the figure was stifling and terrifying.Xiao Meng was standing proudly in the air with his hands behind his back as he looked down upon the store. His eyes suddenly focused onto the body of the big black dog lying at the entrance.\u201cA big black dog?\u201d Xiao Meng slightly muttered. His expression gradually changed from being unconcerned to a grave look as he intently stared at the dog.It was an unfathomable dog! Xiao Meng was bewildered. He was unable to see through the dog. Even though the other party was only lazily lying there, Xiao Meng felt that if he tried to destroy the store, the dog would definitely give him a devastating retaliation.\u201cA mysterious store and a mysterious dog\u2026 It really isn\u2019t simple.\u201d Xiao Meng was unnerved. He was suddenly slightly convinced by what Xiao Xiaolong had said. Perhaps the owner would really be able to save his daughter three days later.\u201cIf you can\u2019t save my daughter in three days, then, even if I have to risk my old life, I will make sure this store is buried with my daughter,\u201d Xiao Meng coldly snorted to himself. Then his figure instantly flew across the sky and disappeared.The big black dog indifferently glanced at the direction where Xiao Meng disappeared. It opened its mouth and yawned. Then it snorted and continued with its sleep.Bu Fang, who was within the store, did not realize what just happened outside the store at all. At the moment, he was fully focused on learning the Elixir Cuisine, the cooking method of the Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup.\u201cElixir Cuisine: Elixirs with medicinal value are blended together with ingredients, which are rich in spirit energy, that also fulfill the requirements of being used in medicines. Special cooking techniques are used to process the elixir and ingredients to produce a medicinal cuisine that possesses color, smell, taste and healing capabilities,\u201d the system explained.\u201cSage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup: It is a soup cooked using the fifth grade spirit herb Heavenly Sage Herb from the Wildlands, the fifth grade spirit beast Blood Phoenix Chicken and numerous spirit herbs based on a strict proportion. This soup possesses life force recovery as well as blood and energy replenishment capabilities. The medicinal value is extremely high but there is a strict requirement regarding the proportion allocation of the spirit herbs.\u201dBu Fang finished reading the cooking method of the Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup. He was not familiar with medicinal cuisines as he did not possess much knowledge about them. Even though he understood the rationale behind the strict proportion, putting it into practice was not so simple.\u201cI should just immediately start practicing.\u201d Bu Fang frowned and decided to attempt the cooking method of the medicinal cuisine.\u201cThe system will prepare three servings of ingredients for the host. The host will only have three tries to complete the dish. \u201d The system\u2019s solemn voice rang out once more, startling Bu Fang. With only three servings of ingredients, he could only fail twice.He earnestly studied the recipe of the Elixir Cuisine once more. As he took a deep breath, his eyes were brimming with confidence.Without Bu Fang knowing, a gigantic cupboard had appeared within the kitchen. It was placed separately on one side and the three servings of ingredients mentioned by the system were inside.As Bu Fang opened the door of the cupboard, a dense amount of spirit energy immediately gushed out, causing all of the pores on his body to slightly open.\u201cGugu\u2026\u201dAt the bottom layer of the cupboard, three chicken cages were installed. Each of the cages had a beautiful chicken that had feathers as red as blood.Bu Fang expressionlessly thought, \u201cSo, the chickens are alive\u2026 I thought the system had already processed them.\u201d\u201cThe system has already sealed off the cultivation level of the Blood Phoenix Chicken. The host only needs to follow the normal procedure of handling a chicken. Reminder: the body of the chicken must be completely preserved. The comb of the Blood Phoenix Chicken must not be damaged.\u201dBu Fang skillfully grabbed one of the Blood Phoenix Chicken from the chicken cages while it desperately flapped its wings and loudly clucked.A Blood Phoenix Chicken with its cultivation level sealed was no different from a free-range chicken on Earth. Of course, the appearance was an exception.The Blood Phoenix Chicken was extremely good-looking. It had a streamlined body and its comb was both large and red, as if it was filled with blood. Its feathers were vermillion red and remarkably eye-catching, while its beak was dark red. From afar, it looked like a burning flame.The fifth grade spirit beast Blood Phoenix Chicken was actually not that strong when it came to fighting. At the very least, it was quite weak compared to other fifth grade spirit beasts. However, its movement speed was very fast, which was why it was rated fifth grade. Of course, within Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store the Blood Phoenix Chicken was no different from any ordinary chicken. It could not even struggle while a third grade Battle-Maniac with no combat ability like Bu Fang easily slaughtered it.Bu Fang skillfully processed the Blood Phoenix Chicken and had almost perfectly handled it. Then he proceeded to take out all sorts of valuable herbs from the cupboard.These spirit herbs were full of spirit energy and the amount leaking out had completely enveloped the kitchen, making it seem like a paradise. The spirit energy seeping out of the Heavenly Sage Herb was especially dense and was almost forming clouds.Following the instructions in the recipe, Bu Fang first created a hole on the Sage Herb and poured the aromatic juice into a bowl. The bowl was half filled when he was done. Then, he used an exquisite knife technique to slice the Sage Herb.Bu Fang stuffed spirit herbs into the stomach of the Blood Phoenix Chicken while following the proportions in the recipe. Then he took out a clay pot and placed the entire Blood Phoenix Chicken into it. He filled the clay pot with water from a spirit spring and started to simmer it.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter half an hour, he opened the lid and poured in the Sage Herb juice and let it continue to simmer.This time, he let the pot continue to simmer for another two hours. The fragrance of the chicken meat was accompanied by the aromatic smell of the Sage Herb as it slowly seeped out from the clay pot. It was like mist as it floated within the kitchen without dissipating.\u201cDid I succeed?\u201d Bu Fang was slightly surprised.However, in the next moment, the system\u2019s solemn voice rang out in his mind.\u201cThe host\u2019s first attempt has failed.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

How could he have failed? The fragrance was so strong\u2026As Bu Fang lifted up the clay pot from the stove and uncovered the lid, a thick amount of steam mixed with the fragrance of chicken gushed out. The sweet scent of Sage Herb was mixed within the fragrance as well. Bu Fang was slightly intoxicated as he greedily inhaled.Within the clay pot, the blood red chicken meat was slightly quivering like jelly and the chicken soup was still bubbling. Every time a bubble burst, a rich fragrance would flow out. The purple juice of the Sage Herb had turned into a lime color after simmering for a while. There was a layer of yellow foam floating above the soup; it was the crystallization of the spirit herbs\u2019 essence.\u201cHmm?\u201d Bu Fang was frowning as he stared at the color of the chicken soup. After a long while, he gave a long sigh and a touch of regret appeared on his face.There was no mistake. Bu Fang had indeed failed. If he had successfully completed the Sage Herb Blood Phoenix Soup, the soup would not be lime in color. In order for the chicken soup to achieve a perfect efficacy, the juice of the Sage Herb had to completely permeate into the meat, and then the color of the soup would be amber.\u201cSystem suggestion: During the process of cooking the Elixir Cuisine, the host can expedite the process of the permeation of the Sage Herb juice into the meat of the chicken by using true energy. This will preserve the efficacy of the spirit herbs and improve the texture of the meat,\u201d the system said.\u201cUse true energy to expedite the process?\u201d Bu Fang\u2019s eyes slightly lit up. There were basically no mistakes in his cooking steps, but he still failed in the end. He reviewed what he did and pondered for a while, but still did not figure out where he was wrong and only realized his mistake after the system\u2019s reminder.He was cooking an Elixir Cuisine and the ingredients and spirit herbs used were extremely abundant. In order to perfectly neutralize the spirit energy of the ingredients and spirit herbs, he could not just rely on kitchen tools to cook the dish. He also needed to use true energy as a medium to complete this Elixir Cuisine.The truth was that it was not just the Elixir Cuisine. In the future, Bu Fang would also need to use true energy as a medium when cooking other dishes. It was also one of the reason why the system would help Bu Fang to convert crystals into true energy.Many high grade ingredients contained a tremendous amount of spirit energy and it was not possible to rely on kitchen tools to handle them. In the event he made a mistake, it would easily result in an explosion or various other problems. Bu Fang would need to consider these issues once he started to use ingredients that exceeded fifth grade.\u201cHuff~\u201d Bu Fang deeply inhaled, then beckoned for Whitey and placed the failed product of the Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup into Whitey\u2019s stomach to be recycled.He stretched his body and yawned. It was time for him to sleep. As a young man aiming to become the God of Cooking, Bu Fang must regulate work and rest. When it was time to sleep, he would definitely not be doing other things.Even though Bu Fang failed his first attempt at cooking the Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup, he was still enigmatically calm and collected as usual.After patting Whitey\u2019s wide belly, Bu Fang went back to his room and peacefully slept.The next morning, he woke up and after washing up, he started that day\u2019s business.He practiced the Meteor Cutting Technique as usual and completed that day\u2019s mission. Then he used the radishes from the practice to cook a Radish Egg-Fried Rice.After Bu Fang tasted it and was satisfied with the taste, he expressionlessly left it for Blacky who was sleeping at the entrance.The store was starting to get popular as well. At the very least when he opened up for business every morning, he would see a loyal army of obese men outside. Fatty Jin and his buddies came everyday regardless of rain or shine.\u201cOwner Bu, I\u2019ll have a serving of Golden Shumai! Oh my, the Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs actually costs fifty crystals! Since it\u2019s expensive enough, I\u2019ll have a serving as well!\u201d Fatty Jin laughed and said as the fat on his face jiggled.The other obese men also ordered their dishes, and so, Bu Fang started his busy work. Ouyang Xiaoyi quickly arrived as well. After working for a few days, she was slightly more experienced and was more proficient at her job.During business hours, Bu Fang was working as usual. He did not have the time to think about the cooking method of the Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup and seemed to be very calm.Xushi unhurriedly walked into the store. Ever since the crown prince ordered him to investigate the place, he was completely taken captive by the delicious food and came almost everyday.\u201cGirl, I\u2019ll have a serving of Boiled Fish!\u201d Xushi slightly nodded toward Ouyang Xiaoyi.Boiled Fish was Xushi\u2019s favorite dish. He liked it more than Lees Fish and Fish Head Tofu Soup. The feeling of pleasure as each slice of smooth and tender fish entered his mouth was simply intoxicating for him.After receiving the order, Bu Fang nodded and walked toward the fish tank. His hands swiftly entered the water and grabbed a black fish out of the tank. The fish was a type of freshwater fish and was a grade lower than the Thunder Silver Carp. However, the texture of its flesh was more tender than the one from the Thunder Silver Carp.When Bu Fang placed the struggling fish on the cutting board, the fish even spat out a stream of water at him, creating a patch of wetness on his clothes.Bu Fang was expressionless as he smacked the fish\u2019s head with the kitchen knife. Then he skillfully descaled and gutted the fish. Finally, the fish was sliced into pieces. His cutting technique was even more superb after a few days of training and his speed when slicing the fish was extremely fast.Once the fish was sliced, the other steps were much easier. After the spirit vegetables were handled, they were placed into a single pot to boil. When a fragrance drifted out, he threw in the slices of fish that were just slightly heated up with ginger water to remove the fishy smell. After boiling for a while, the dish was plated.The fragrant and glossy Boiled Fish was placed in front of Xushi, causing his eyes to suddenly lit up and reveal an eager expression on his face.Perhaps even the crown prince was unaware that his number one advisor was actually a foodie.Dada.A middle-aged man, with a handsome face that seemed to have been sculpted from marble, stepped into the store with his hands behind his back. His gaze was steady and cold, while his aura was tense.The rich fragrance that filled the interior of the store caused a slight amazement to appear on the middle-aged man\u2019s face.When the middle-aged man saw Ouyang Xiaoyi, he was startled once more and puzzledly asked, \u201cHmm? Xiaoyi? What are you doing here?\u201dAs his voice rang out within the store, Xushi who was just about to put a slice of Boiled Fish into his mouth suddenly trembled and the slice of fish fell into the bowl once more. The result was some of the sauce from the bowl splattered onto his beautiful beard.\u201cGreat\u2026 Great General Xiao Meng?\u201d When Xushi turned his head saw who it was, he immediately stood up from his seat and greeted while performing a fist and palm salute. At the same time, he thought, \u201cMy heavens\u2026 The Great General Xiao Meng actually appeared in this little restaurant as well? This is an important information. I must inform the crown prince.\u201dXiao Meng nodded. He naturally recognized the crown prince\u2019s number one advisor. He appreciated the ability of Xushi to plan strategies and schemes as well and recognized him as a talent.\u201cUnc\u2026 Uncle Xiao, why are you here as well?\u201d Ouyang was still afraid of Xiao Meng. After all, the number one expert within the imperial city was very prestigious.\u201cSince I am at a restaurant, I am naturally here to eat,\u201d Xiao Meng simply replied and turned to look at the menu. The astronomical values on the menu did not surprise him and his expression did not change in the slightest.As expected of a seventh grade Battle-Saint, his temperament was steady.Xushi secretly nodded and gave a thumbs up to Xiao Meng in his mind.\u201cSweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs, improved Egg-Fried Rice, Lees Fish, Golden Shumai\u2026 as well as a jar of Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine,\u201d Xiao Meng calmly read out the name of the dishes, while standing with his hands behind his back.After memorising the order, Ouyang Xiaoyi went toward the kitchen and relayed the dishes to Bu Fang.Bu Fang was slightly surprised as he thought, \u201cIt looks like a big spender came, these many dishes would cost a lot of crystals\u2026\u201d After expressionlessly nodding, Bu Fang began to cook.After Xushi quickly finished the Boiled Fish, he bid farewell to Xiao Meng and swiftly left. He was in a hurry to inform the crown prince about the news.Since the Great General Xiao was visiting the restaurant, it was a good chance for the crown prince to win him over.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euNot long after Xushi left, Ouyang Xiaoyi timidly served each of the dishes that Xiao Meng had ordered.Every single dish exuded a rich fragrance. Even someone as calm as Xiao Meng could not help but be surprised\u2026 As he discovered that the taste of the dishes were far more delicious than he had expected.They were far better than the dishes of the number one restaurant in the imperial city, the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant.The last order, the Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine, was personally served by Bu Fang. As he walked out of the kitchen, he was quickly noticed by Xiao Meng.Xiao Meng put down his chopsticks, looked at Bu Fang with a fake smile and said, \u201cYou\u2019re the owner? The Owner Bu who injured my daughter and claimed to be able to save her as well?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There was a trace of coldness in his tone. He really wanted to see what kind of miracles the owner of such a small store could conjure.With Xiao Yanyu\u2019s injuries, even the imperial physicians could only barely keep her alive. How could the perpetrator dare to conceitedly claim that he could save her?Bu Fang was holding a jar of Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine when he came out. When he heard Xiao Meng\u2019s question, he immediately went into a daze.\u201cIs this Xiao Yanyu\u2019s father?\u201d Bu Fang thought as he glanced at the middle-aged man in front of him. Honestly speaking, the Xiao family\u2019s genes were indeed excellent. Every single member was good-looking.\u201cOh, that\u2019s right. I am that shop owner who is too benevolent,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly replied.He walked to Xiao Meng\u2019s table, then placed the jar of wine down and said, \u201cHere\u2019s your Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine, please enjoy your drink.\u201dXiao Meng indifferently looked at Bu Fang and placed one hand on the cloth cover of the Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine as he coldly said, \u201cYou injured my daughter. Don\u2019t you have anything to say about that?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s there to say? Even though my store is small and the location is remote, there are still rules to be followed. Since she decided to make a move within my store, she should have been prepared to be injured,\u201d Bu Fang glanced at Xiao Meng and expressionlessly replied.Bu Fang\u2019s neither humble nor arrogant reply caused Xiao Meng to slightly pause, then the smile on his face became even wider. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since anyone has spoken to me like this\u2026 Since you know that I am Yanyu\u2019s father, you should know my identity.\u201d\u201cWith my cultivation level, demolishing this store is an easy matter. Aren\u2019t you afraid that I would kill you? Or destroy your store?\u201dAs Xiao Meng finished speaking, an intimidating aura gushed out from his body. The aura felt like it was released by the world itself, and the entire area became extremely heavy.Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s adorable face turned pale as a trace of horror appeared in her large eyes. She quickly retreated and hid in a distance. It was terrifying when Xiao Meng was angry.\u201cOh, you want to destroy my store?\u201d Facing Xiao Meng\u2019s powerful aura, Bu Fang only calmly replied with an \u201coh\u201d, and then he seriously said, \u201cYou do not have that capability.\u201dEven though the aura was heavy as a mountain and grandiose as a dragon, Bu Fang was completely unaffected within the store. As long as the system was around, all sorts of aura were transient.Bu Fang\u2019s reply was beyond the expectations of others.Ouyang Xiaoyi was stunned for a moment and then looked at the smelly boss with a face filled with admiration. Even though she thought he was reckless, she felt that he was actually really dashing when he said those words.\u201cI do not have that capability?\u201d Xiao Meng stood up and was so exasperated that he started laughing. As a seventh grade Battle-Saint, how could he not be capable of destroying a little store?Within an instant, Bu Fang only felt his vision blurring as Xiao Meng appeared in front of him. That handsome face was only an inch away from Bu Fang and the coldness coming from Xiao Meng\u2019s body was causing the pores on Bu Fang\u2019s body to shrink.\u201cYou\u2019re quite arrogant for a mere third grade Battle-Maniac. Let me see whether you have the qualification to be arrogant,\u201d Xiao Meng simply said as he lifted his hand and tried to grab Bu Fang.Bu Fang expressionlessly stared at Xiao Meng as the mood became tense within that instant.Bang!Bu Fang had taken two steps backward. Xiao Meng\u2019s palm did not make contact with Bu Fang, but instead was blocked by Whitey who appeared between them.Whitey\u2019s mechanical arm was raised and had stopped Xiao Meng\u2019s palm. There was green smoke coming from their palms as they collided.\u201cTroublemaker, you will be stripped as an example to others,\u201d Whitey\u2019s mechanical eyes were flashing red as its mechanical voice emotionlessly rang out.Xiao Meng\u2019s eyes lit up as he fixedly stared at Whitey. He thought, \u201cThis is the mechanical puppet that injured Yanyu? It actually blocked my attack with ease! As expected, this store has some capabilities.\u201dXiao Meng\u2019s figure slightly twisted as another punch headed toward Whitey at a lightning fast speed.Bang!Bang bang bang!As the two exchanged blows, their fists almost turned into a blur as they continuously collided, and the muffled sound of their collisions rumbled within the store.Bu Fang\u2019s pupils constricted from surprise. It was the first time that he had seen someone fighting with Whitey at this level. As expected of a seventh grade Battle-Saint.Ouyang Xiaoyi was even more surprised. In her heart, the scary Uncle Xiao had always been the strongest person. She did not expect the adorable Whitey to be that formidable as well!With a loud noise, the two took several steps backward.Green smoke was coming from Whitey\u2019s mechanical palms while its mechanicals eyes flashed at a rapid frequency.Xiao Meng was slightly frowning as he shook his arms while taking a deep breath.\u201cSystem, isn\u2019t Whitey invincible? Why can\u2019t it defeat this middle-aged man?\u201d Bu Fang puzzledly asked. He had always thought that Whitey was invincible.\u201cWhitey\u2019s strength is based on the host\u2019s level by adding four grades to the host\u2019s cultivation level. As the security of the store, Whitey is strong if the host is strong. Consequently, Whitey is weak if the host is weak,\u201d the system seriously explained.The corner of Bu Fang\u2019s mouth twitched. His current cultivation level was only third grade, which meant that Whitey was seventh grade. Would that mean it would only be able to draw with Xiao Meng, who was seventh grade as well?\u201cSystem, what if Whitey is unable to defeat the troublemaker?\u201d Bu Fang asked the system in his mind.\u201cThere\u2019s no need for the host to worry. Whitey is not the last line of defense. However, the host would still need to work hard to earn more crystals. The host should fight for the increment of your cultivation level to raise Whitey\u2019s combat strength to ninth grade,\u201d the system said.Boom boom boom!Xiao Meng had become serious after colliding with Whitey a few more times. For the number one expert within the empire to be unable to deal with the puppet of a little store, he would be a laughingstock if word ever got out.Just when he was prepared to release a battle technique to settle the match, he suddenly felt a terrifying aura. This aura was invisible and intangible and directly applied on his mind, causing his body to freeze up. The battle technique that he just gathered within his hand was dispersed as well.At the entrance, the sleepy big black dog gave a big yawn and its doggy eyes meaningfully glanced at Xiao Meng.That single glance made Xiao Meng break out in sweat. He almost forgot about the mysterious dog lying at the entrance.\u201cVery well, your store has some capabilities indeed. I hope that you would really be able to save my daughter in two days. Otherwise\u2026 even if we perish together, I will make sure you pay with your life.\u201d As Xiao Meng\u2019s aura dissipated, the haze enveloping the store immediately disappeared. Both Ouyang Xiaoyi and Bu Fang felt relieved.The intimidating aura disappeared just as quickly as it had appeared. Xiao Meng returned to his seat and opened the cloth cover of the Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine. As he started to pour the wine, a rich wine aroma filled the store.\u201cThe troublemaker\u2019s cultivation is quite strong. Unable to strip as an example to others\u2026\u201d Whitey\u2019s mechanical eyes were still flashing as it reported to Bu Fang.Bu Fang expressionlessly patted Whitey\u2019s belly to indicate that it was alright and Whitey returned to the kitchen as well.\u201cWhy did Xiao Meng stop?\u201d Bu Fang puzzledly thought. \u201cCould it be that the last line of defense mentioned by the system took effect? Then what was this last line of defense?\u201d Bu Fang was suddenly curious.After that, Xiao Meng did not cause any trouble. When he finished his food and drinks, he contentedly paid the check and left.A seventh grade Battle-Saint was affluent and did not lack money.Bu Fang expressionlessly watched as Xiao Meng left. The big black dog lying at the entrance also snorted and continued with its sleep.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIt\u2019s troublesome, this time around.\u201d Bu Fang took in a deep breath and was suddenly slightly nervous. If he really did not manage to produce the Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup and failed to save Xiao Yanyu, this middle-aged man might really try to kill him.While having such anxious thoughts in his mind, Bu Fang continued on with the business.After the opening hours was over, he closed up the shop and started the second attempt of cooking the Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup.With the first attempt, he had already grasped the trick of using true energy as a medium. However, it was also his first time to cook using true energy, so he was unable to guarantee his success.In summary, this was a job that required some skill.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was astonished as well, since he had not expected someone like General Xiao Meng to appear at that restaurant.\u201cDid you find out the reason why General Xiao Meng appeared at the restaurant?\u201d The crown prince asked as he stood up and lightly paced about.Xushi paused for a moment and was frowning as he uncertainty replied, \u201cPerhaps General Xiao was attracted by the taste of the restaurant\u2019s dishes\u2026\u201dThe crown prince turned his head and stared at Xushi with a false smile. \u201cDo you really think that your answer is realistic? General Xiao is a seventh grade Battle-Saint and has already reached a state where he does not need to consume food. Since he has no desire toward food and drinks, why would he go to a restaurant for the sake of delicious food?\u201dThe corner of Xushi\u2019s mouth curled up. He really believed that General Xiao was there just to eat. The crown prince had not tasted the dishes of that restaurant, so he had no idea. He would not be questioning that assumption if he had tasted the food there at least once.At any rate, from Xushi\u2019s point of view, that restaurant was really miraculous.\u201cYour Highness is right. I\u2019ll go and investigate right now,\u201d Xushi said as he performed the fist and palm salute without disputing.\u201cGo on. It seems that you really enjoy the dishes from that restaurant. Is it really that delicious?\u201d The crown prince lightly glanced at Xushi and asked. He was naturally aware of Xushi\u2019s whereabouts.\u201cThat\u2019s right, Your Highness. Especially the Boiled Fish\u2026 It\u2019s both delicious and tender!\u201d Xushi\u2019s eyes lit up and replied. Immediately after, he remembered he was speaking to the crown prince, so he suddenly shut his mouth and withdrew with a forced smile.\u201cBoiled Fish\u2026 It sounds pretty good.\u201d The crown prince was startled for a moment and then a smile appeared on his face.\u2026As the night fell, the moonlight was like a veil as a it draped a layer of afterglow over the land.The kitchen of Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store.Bu Fang took in a deep breath and took out a cage with a Blood Phoenix Chicken inside from the cupboard. He took the Blood Phoenix Chicken out from the cage while ignoring its cooing.After pulling off the blood red feathers and removing the Blood Phoenix Chicken\u2019s intestines, Bu Fang followed the instructions of the recipe to cook the Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup once more.He sliced open a hole on the fleshy body of the Sage Herb and poured the juice into a small bowl. Then the Sage Herb was sliced into pieces and the other spirit herbs that were already processed were stuffed into the stomach of the Blood Phoenix Chicken. He finally took out the clay plot, then filled it with water from a spirit spring and placed the Blood Phoenix Chicken inside.The clay pot was allowed to stew for a while until the light fragrance of the chicken meat drifted out. As Bu Fang uncovered the lid, a thick amount of steam mixed with the fragrance of meat and spirit herbs gushed out, giving him a refreshing feeling. He poured the Sage Herb juice into the clay pot and covered the lid. Then, it was time for the most important step.\u201cSystem, how do I use true energy to cook? Do I directly spray the clay pot with true energy?\u201d Bu Fang puzzledly asked.\u201cTrue energy culinary: The chef nourishes the ingredients with true energy by permeating it through the kitchen tools. The chef will be tested on his ability to manipulate true energy and control over the taste of the dish.\u201dBu Fang was startled when he heard the system\u2019s explanation. As his gaze focused on the clay pot being roasted on the fire, he saw waves of hot air radiating from it.\u201cSystem, are you sure? If I place my hand onto the clay pot, wouldn\u2019t my hand be burned?\u201d The corner of Bu Fang\u2019s mouth was twitching.\u201cThis clay pot was specially made. It will automatically adjust the temperature once it detects true energy. There is no need for the host to worry,\u201d the system solemnly said.Bu Fang was skeptical as he raised his hand and sparkling rays of light circulated on his palm. It was like a veil was draped over it.A third grade Battle-Maniac was able to manifest true energy outside of their body and was also the minimum standard for true energy culinary.Bu Fang had a solemn expression as he slowly placed his palm onto the lid of the claypot. A warm feeling was transmitted to his palm, but the hotness he expected did not appear.\u201cHow amazing,\u201d Bu Fang exclaimed in surprise.Then he closed his eyes and manipulated the true energy within his body. He slowly directed the true energy through the clay pot into the ingredients boiling inside\u2026It was a kind of invisible permeation that was as silent as a spring breeze in the night.Through the lid, Bu Fang seemed to be able to feel the changes in the ingredients inside the clay pot. They were constantly absorbing spirit energy under the nourishment of true energy and the Sage Herb juice was constantly permeating into the meat of the chicken as well.After half an hour of transferring true energy like this, Bu Fang slowly pulled back his hand and stopped.There were fine beads of sweat dripping from his forehead. The loss of true energy was making him feel a little tired.Bu Fang sat down on a chair to recover for around half an hour, then he carried on with the true energy culinary once more. The true energy within his body was controlled according to his wishes as it flowed into the clay pot and continuously nourished the ingredients.After another half an hour, Bu Fang pulled back his hand once more. He heavily breathed out and used a towel to wipe off the sweat on his forehead.At the moment, the kitchen was unknowingly enveloped within an extremely rich fragrance. There was the smell of meat, spirit herbs and Sage Herb mixed within the fragrance.Compared to the day before, the fragrance was even more enticing. If the fragrance from before would make a person feel as if they were playing at a creek, then the current fragrance would make them feel as if they were exposed to a raging river.Even Bu Fang could not help but sniff a few times as the rich fragrance was intoxicating. This was the result of true energy culinary. It was indeed superior to ordinary culinary and the taste would definitely be better as well.The true energy was like a type of seasoning. After it was added into the ingredients, a special catalysis occurred and improved the taste of the ingredients. In addition, the spirit energy within the ingredients was more evenly distributed into various parts of the ingredients.After stewing the ingredients and performing half an hour of cooking using true energy twice, the Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup was finally completed. Even Bu Fang was feeling extremely hungry as he breathed in the smell of the dish.Carrying the clay pot to the table, Bu Fang uncovered the lid and a rich fragrance immediately gushed out. The hot steam, accompanied with the fragrance, spread into the air.After greedily inhaling the air once, Bu Fang\u2019s gaze finally focused on the contents of the clay pot.The moment he looked, an expression filled with indescribable happiness appeared on his face. \u201cI succeeded!\u201dThe Blood Phoenix Chicken was quietly lying within the clay pot. The meat was crystal clear like jelly and was slightly trembling due to the hot air bubbles. The color of the soup was amber and there was no essence floating in the soup like the day before. Evidently, the essence had completely permeated into the chicken soup due to cooking with true energy.Bu Fang\u2019s stomach rumbled. The meat of the Blood Phoenix Chicken was as exquisitely beautiful as an artwork and looked extremely appetizing.\u201cSystem, this time the Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup should be considered a success, right?\u201d Bu Fang proudly asked the system. He was a genius. How difficult could true energy culinary be?\u201cIt barely meets the eligibility criterion. Does the host really want the system to rate the Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup this time?\u201d the system solemnly asked.Bu Fang was stunned for a moment. Before he could react, the system began to solemnly announce its rating.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThe host did not manage to fully preserve the Blood Phoenix Chicken during processing and the skin was slightly damaged. The Sage Herb juice was added too early and the pieces of Sage Herb were not sliced uniformly and thinly enough. The control during the true energy culinary process was feeble and the level of true energy was too weak. Overall rating: a Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup that barely qualifies.\u201dBu Fang expressionlessly glanced at the chicken soup. He suddenly felt that the soup that he thought was perfect had become not so perfect. The fragrance seemed to have weakened as well.\u201cA system with a venomous tongue would not be loved by the host!\u201dBu Fang was exasperated. He decided to drink a bowl of chicken soup to calm down and switched his focus to the Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup.As it was the first time he was tasting a dish cooked using true energy, he was slightly excited.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The pristine chicken soup, which was amber in color, contained no trace of impurities and was richly aromatic. Under the light, the grease was shimmering and made it seem as if the Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup was embedded with numerous sparkling gems.The color, smell, and taste were criterion to judge whether a dish met a certain standard. Even though the Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup was heavily criticized by the system, it was still a delicacy that was hard to come by, based on the three criterion.The jelly-like meat of the chicken was especially appetizing and Bu Fang was already eager to have a bite.He took out a small blue and white porcelain bowl and used a porcelain spoon to fill half of the bowl with the richly fragrant chicken soup. The fragrance that the amber chicken soup exuded was lingering around the tip of Bu Fang\u2019s nose, causing him to subconsciously lick his lips.For a soup such as the Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup, there was a particular eating method as well. From the start, you must not immediately start with the meat. You should first drink a spoonful of soup and let the taste completely cover your mouth and stomach.Once the stomach has been completely covered by the warm soup, you could then proceed to the meat. That way, you would be able to easily sample the taste of the meat and experience the tenderness of every bit of the chicken.As he drank a spoonful of amber soup, the rich fragrance was like a bomb that exploded within his mouth and dominated his taste buds. The fragrance of the Blood Phoenix Chicken, the aroma of the Sage Herb, and the smell of the other spirit herbs had all burst forth at the same time.Bu Fang felt as if he was roaming within a medicinal thicket on a mountain. As the medicinal plants swayed along with the wind, a thick aroma would drift toward him. A scarlet alluring Blood Phoenix Chicken was flapping its wings above the thicket and contentedly roaming about.\u201cDelicious!\u201dBu Fang praised after drinking a spoonful, then his gaze focused on the meat of the Blood Phoenix Chicken that he had been coveting for some time.The chicken skin became springy after it was cooked using true energy. As Bu Fang tore off one of the drumsticks, a long strip of skin from other parts of the chicken was pulled off as well. The chicken skin also seemed to have become slightly transparent.Even though the meat was blood red, there was no taste of blood when he ate it. Compared to ordinary chicken meat, it was even more tender and could be easily swallowed without much chewing.Bu Fang was holding onto a drumstick with relish as he continuously gnawed on it. Soon, an entire drumstick was completely finished and his lips were covered with oil.The bones of the Blood Phoenix Chicken were permeated with a blood color as well and were exuding a fragrance different from the meat.Filling up another bowl of chicken soup, Bu Fang was slowly enjoying the taste as he comfortably curled up on a chair. The feeling of eating one\u2019s fill was simply too marvelous.Even though Bu Fang was tempted to finish the entire chicken by himself, he could not do it. The Blood Phoenix Chicken by itself was a spirit beast ingredient and was filled with a rich amount of spirit energy. Adding that to the valuable spirit herbs and the Heavenly Sage Herb, it was very nutritious dish.Bu Fang was only able to eat that much even with the system\u2019s help in restricting the effects. If he continued to eat, he might burst open even with the system\u2019s suppression.Even so, after Bu Fang stopped eating, he still felt as if his entire body was on fire and his eyes were practically spewing fire.Bu Fang heavily breathed out and as he stood up. Blood was actually streaming out from his nose.It was too nutritious\u2026 to the point where he was having a nosebleed.Bu Fang was expressionless. He originally intended to dump the rest of the meat into Whitey\u2019s stomach for recycling. However, after thinking for a while, he took the rest of the Blood Phoenix Chicken to Blackey while holding his nose.\u201cHere, Blacky. Time for supper,\u201d Bu Fang said in a muffled voice. Then he placed the Blood Phoenix Chicken in front of Blacky.Blacky, who was lying on the ground with its eyes closed, suddenly opened them. Its doggy eyes were shining as brightly as a meteor shower.\u201cOwooo~\u201d Blacky joyfully howled as it thought, \u201cHuman, you\u2019re finally tactful enough to know that you should show respect to your elders!\u201dThen, Blacky started to gobble down the Blood Phoenix Chicken.Bu Fang returned to the kitchen and wiped off his nosebleed. He felt as his entire body was filled with inexhaustible energy and did not feel sleepy at all. And so, he lifted up that heavy custom made kitchen knife, then took out a few thousand radishes and started slicing them.He could not stop at all\u2026The next day, Bu Fang was still full of energy even after cutting radishes for the entire night. He opened up the store and was officially open for business.Fatty Jin and his buddies punctually arrived to eat.\u201cOwner Bu, why do I feel a murderous aura coming from you today?\u201d Fatty Jin puzzledly stared at Bu Fang.Bu Fang expressionlessly glanced at Fatty Jin. His tongue slightly licked his lips and he said, \u201cReally?\u201d\u201cGood heavens\u2026\u201d Fatty Jin subconsciously shuddered as he bewilderedly looked at Bu Fang. He thought, \u201cDid Owner Bu lick his lips just now? Why did he lick his lips?\u201dAfter Bu Fang served all of the dishes that Fatty Jin ordered, he returned to the kitchen. After chopping radishes for the entire night, how could there not be murderous aura leaking from him\u2026The little loli, Ouyang Xiaoyi, happily skipped down her way to the store. It was her last day as the waitress and once the day was over, she was free to go.\u201cHowever\u2026 Why do I feel a slight reluctance?\u201d Xiaoyi thought while tilting her head.\u201cXiaoyi, serve the food.\u201dBu Fang\u2019s yell caused Ouyang Xiaoyi to give up on thinking about this problem.\u201cI am coming.\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi eagerly ran toward the familiar window and carried away the fragrant dish that Bu Fang had cooked.As each of the familiar customers entered and left, the day\u2019s opening hours was about to end as well.Ji Chengxue came that day as well. He was gentle and refined as usual and was not affected by the assassination attempt in the slightest. After not coming for a while, he discovered that there were many new dishes. He excitedly ordered each of the new dishes and satisfiedly left after eating.The Great Secretariat Su hurriedly came as well. He had a soft spot for Egg-Fried Rice and only ordered that.Xiao Yue was still carefree as he came and went. He only ordered a jar of Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine and once again reserved a jar for the next day.\u201cI am so tired.\u201d Ouyang Xiao was slightly exhausted as she sat on the chair while panting. As the store became more popular, the amount of customers increased. Over the course of a day, it was quite tiring as well. However, Ouyang Xiaoyi was satisfied with this sense of fulfillment.\u201cSmelly boss, I am about to advance to third grade Battle-Maniac! When the time comes, there are a lot of dishes I am going to order and taste, especially the Fish Head Tofu Soup!\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi said to Bu Fang as her large eyes blinked.\u201cOh, alright. I\u2019ll wait for you,\u201d Bu Fang was also sitting down as he expressionlessly replied.Ouyang Xiaoyi was particularly talkative that day and she was talking to Bu Fang non-stop. On the other hand, Bu Fang remained indifferent while occasionally nodding and replying with a \u201coh\u201d.\u201cSmelly boss, can you really save elder sister Yanyu tomorrow? I\u2019ve always believed in you.\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi became moody all of a sudden.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to worry. You should trust me.\u201d Bu Fang was stunned for a moment. Then he stroked Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s head and slightly squeezed out a faint smile on his face.\u201cSmelly boss, your smile is really ugly!\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi disdainfully rolled her eyes at Bu Fang.Bu Fang\u2019s expression immediately stiffened and returned to his expressionless appearance once more.\u201cThe smelly boss is still better-looking when you\u2019re serious.\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi chortled as she skipped toward the entrance of the store.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cSmelly boss, I\u2019ll come again tomorrow. You must save elder sister Yanyu, I believe in you!\u201dAs Bu Fang looked at Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s disappearing figure, a touch of gentleness flashed across his eyes. He rubbed his hair that was being tied up by a woolen rope, then turned around and returned to the kitchen.\u201cHow could I fail when I am this good-looking?\u201d Bu Fang indifferently muttered to himself.Regarding the rescue of Xiao Yanyu the next day, since he had already experienced cooking the Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup, he was confident that he would not fail.He was calm because he was confident.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A burst of cold wind blew into the store and was mixed with the cold autumn rain. The rhythmic drizzle was like a curtain as it completely enveloped the entire sky.Entering the kitchen, he took out the radishes to carry out his daily knife skill training. Then he cooked a few other practice dishes and carried one of practice dishes that was still piping hot to Blacky.\u201cBlacky, it\u2019s time to eat,\u201d Bu Fang placed the dish within the store and called Blacky to come in. It was still raining outside and it would be bad to get wet.As Blacky breathed in the fragrance, the lazy dog actually stood up and enchantingly strode into the store like a cat\u2026 Then it began to gobble down the food within the bowl.Bu Fang remained expressionless as he thought, \u201cWhy is a dog walking like a cat?\u201dFatty Jin and his buddies were drenched as they entered the store while holding up umbrellas. They greeted Bu Fang with smiles on their faces and placed the oil-paper umbrellas at the entrance.\u201cOwner Bu, good morning. I\u2019ll have the same dishes as yesterday,\u201d Fatty Jin sat down at a table and said toward Bu Fang as he patted his robe that was drenched in the rain. The other obese men ordered their dishes as well.Bu Fang nodded and indifferently walked into the kitchen. After a while, a rich fragrance drifted out from it.After sending off Fatty Jin and his buddies, Bu Fang was able to rest for a short while. It might be due to the rain, but there was fewer customers than usual.\u201cSmelly boss! Give me a serving of Fish Head Tofu Soup!\u201dA loud yell came from outside of the store. Before the person even appeared, her voice had already reached.Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s face was filled with excitement as she ran into the store. Her trousers were slightly drenched from the rain, but she did not care in the slightest.\u201cSmelly boss, I\u2019ve advanced! Hurry up and give me the Fish Head Tofu Soup!\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s eyes were flashing with excitement as she looked at Bu Fang with a face filled with expectations.Bu Fang was stunned for a moment, then carefully observed the girl. He discovered that there really was a faintly discernible true energy lingering on her skin, which was the manifestation of true energy outside of her body. However, she was unable to skillfully control it, which meant that she had just advanced.\u201cOh, alright. Wait for it,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly said, then entered the kitchen.Ouyang Xiaoyi narrowed her eyes as a smile appeared on her adorable face. She was leaning on the window as she eagerly waited for the Fish Head Tofu Soup.Bu Fang\u2019s speed was very fast. He was now extremely familiar with most of the dishes. Even though the cooking steps of the Fish Head Tofu Soup were troublesome, it was nothing for the current him.The milky white fish soup was exuding a dense amount of hot air, while the flesh of the fish was delicious and tender, and the crystal-clear tofu was delicate and plump.As Bu Fang placed the Fish Head Tofu Soup at the window, Ouyang Xiaoyi eagerly carried it away. The two of them were well-coordinated and their actions were smooth and natural.Bu Fang was soon startled as he thought, \u201cDidn\u2019t her job end already?\u201dGlancing at Ouyang Xiaoyi who was happily drinking fish soup and eating fish, a faint smile appeared on Bu Fang\u2019s face.Drinking a bowl of piping hot Fish Head Tofu Soup during a cold autumn rain was simply a comfortable thing to do.At the entrance of the alleyway, several figures slowly made their way to the store. Their mood was stifling and heavy.The Xiao family had brought the fading Xiao Yanyu over. However, none of the Xiao family members seemed to be hopeful and they had sorrowful expressions on their faces.Xiao Meng was carrying his daughter, Xiao Yanyu, in his arms as he firmly walked toward Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store. His face was extremely grim. Since the imperial physicians had already stated that it was a hopeless situation, he could only entrust his hope to this store of unknown origins.Since he was worried, he had the store investigated for a second time. Even though nothing was discovered, at the very least\u2026 he had an inexplicable confidence in the store.Bu Fang remained expressionless as he watched the Xiao family file into the store and beckoned them to sit down.Xiao Yanyu\u2019s beautiful face was whiter than paper and without a single trace of blood. It was obvious that her life force was depleting rapidly and her aura was extremely weak.\u201cYou said\u2026 you can save my sister. I believe in you, that\u2019s why I waited until today!\u201d Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s voice was slightly hoarse as he stared at Bu Fang and said.Bu Fang nodded and calmly replied, \u201cI can definitely save her. However, I need a while to cook the medicinal cuisine. Wait here for a while.\u201d\u201cI am depending on you.\u201d Xiao Xiaolong heavily breathed in and performed a fist and palm salute to Bu Fang.Bu Fang walked toward the kitchen to cook the Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup.Xiao Meng was sitting upright on a chair. His expression was extremely grave and no one could tell what he was thinking.After entering the kitchen, Bu Fang began to make preparations.He processed the Blood Phoenix Chicken based on the instructions and stuffed the spirit herbs into the stomach of the chicken. Then he placed the entire chicken into the clay pot and let it stew. Once the fragrance of the meat was starting to drift out, Bu Fang poured the Sage Herb juice that he already prepared into the clay pot.Taking a deep breath, Bu Fang gathered the true energy within his body and placed his palm on top of the clay pot. A strange feeling immediately started to appear, as if his will and the dish were connected together. True energy continued to spew out and guide the cooking of the chicken soup.Within the store, the members of the Xiao family were slightly restless from waiting and were constantly pacing around the store. The rain outside was getting heavier and heavier, and the sound of the rain incessantly resounded.\u201cWhat are you so restless about? Sit down and quietly wait,\u201d Xiao Meng slightly chided the Xiao family members who were pacing about with his eyes still closed.\u201cIs\u2026 Is this store really reliable? Even the imperial physicians were unable to save the young lady, what can the owner of a restaurant do?\u201d the housekeeper of the Xiao family mumbled to himself.\u201cThat\u2019s what I am thinking as well. The imperial physicians were only able to prolong young lady\u2019s life. How could someone who isn\u2019t even a physician cure the young lady\u2019s injuries?\u201d One of Xiao Yanyu\u2019s maidservants slightly sighed.The others were chattering incessantly as well, expressing their suspicions toward Bu Fang.\u201cYou\u2019re noisy! Shut up,\u201d Xiao Meng coldly bellowed. Immediately, all of them became quiet and did not dare to whisper among themselves anymore.At the same moment, a rich fragrance drifted out from the kitchen. The fragrance of chicken meat and the aroma of spirit herbs were mixed within it.Everyone was suddenly sniffing as they tried to capture the fragrance in the air.Ji Chengxue was wearing a white robe as he leisurely approached. He placed his umbrella at the entrance and was immediately surprised when he noticed the crowd. As he entered the store, he realized that they were all from the Xiao family.\u201cGreetings to your Highness,\u201d Xiao Meng said as he performed a fist and palm salute to Ji Chengxue.Ji Chengxue had a gentle smile on his face as he nodded and responded with a fist and palm salute. Then after asking Xiao Meng, he found out that Xiao Yanyu was injured and needed the store\u2019s owner to treat her.\u201cOwner Bu is capable of treating injuries as well?\u201d Ji Chengxue was astonished.\u201cHahaha! This store is really secluded. It would\u2019ve taken a while if I had to find this place on my own.\u201d A burst of laughter suddenly rang out from outside as two figures entered the store.\u201cThe crown prince?\u201d The members of the Xiao family were slightly bewildered. It was unbelievable that such a store would be able to attract two princes.\u201cOh, so third brother is here as well. What a coincidence.\u201d The crown prince, Ji Chengan, slightly smiled and then performed a fist and palm salute to Xiao Meng.\u201cWhere\u2019s Owner Bu?\u201d Xushi puzzledly asked.\u201cThe smelly boss is preparing to treat elder sister Yanyu. The opening hours has ended earlier today,\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi charmingly replied. She subconsciously became the waitress once again.\u201cTreat injuries?\u201d A weird expression immediately appeared on the faces of the crown prince, Ji Chengan and Xushi. They actually came to a restaurant to treat injuries? Were they really not joking?As the fragrance in the air intensified, everyone who was waiting began to experience hunger pangs.After a long while, a slim and tall figure walked out of the kitchen with a piping hot clay pot in his hands.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBu Fang expressionlessly walked out of the kitchen and placed the clay pot on a table.\u201cThis is the Elixir Cuisine for saving Xiao Yanyu, the Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup.\u201dBu Fang expressionlessly said as everyone puzzledly stared at him. After he finished talking, he uncovered the clay pot.As the lid of the clay pot was removed, hot steam rose up and a rich fragrance gushed out, spreading into the air. The crystal-clear chicken meat was slightly quivering and the amber chicken soup was gleaming.The pupils of everyone present slightly constricted as they suddenly breathed in the fragrance.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The aromatic chicken meat was slightly quivering like jelly as it exuded a rich fragrance. The color of the chicken soup was extremely beautiful as lights and colors overflowed everywhere.As Xiao Meng\u2019s eyes slightly opened, his pupils were radiating brightly. He was staring intensely at the clay pot on the table and the blood-colored chicken meat contained within.\u201cWhat a dense amount of spirit energy!\u201d Xiao Meng was extremely astonished as he sucked in a breath of cold air. With the terrifying senses of a seventh grade Battle-Saint, he could easily tell how much spirit energy was contained within the blood-colored chicken and that the amber chicken soup was filled with the aura of many valuable medicinal ingredients.When he looked at the bowl of chicken soup, even he was subconsciously swallowing his saliva.\u201cThis is\u2026 fifth grade spirit beast, Blood Phoenix Chicken?!\u201d The crown prince was licking his lips while staring at the chicken meat within the clay pot when he suddenly thought of something and shouted in pleasant surprise.\u201cBlood Phoenix Chicken?!\u201d Xiao Meng was slightly baffled as he looked toward Ji Chengan.\u201cThe Blood Phoenix Chicken is a fifth grade spirit beast that lives in the Triangle Prairies Zone of the Wildlands. This breed of chicken has blood-colored feathers, skin, and meat, but the meat itself is filled with spirit energy. Once it is cooked, consuming the meat strengthens one\u2019s vitality and recovers one\u2019s blood and energy. It is extremely difficult to obtain this ingredient,\u201d Ji Chengan clearly explained as he looked toward Bu Fang with an inquiring look.Bu Fang nodded and expressionlessly replied, \u201cThat\u2019s right. This is a Blood Phoenix Chicken.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve seen it mentioned within the ancient records of the imperial palace. I didn\u2019t expect that it really was this kind of strange beast that lived within the Triangle Prairies Zones of the Wildlands.\u201d Ji Chengan lamented, but shook his head immediately after.\u201cUnfortunately, even though this Blood Phoenix Chicken is valuable, as Yanyu\u2019s injuries were due to the depletion of her life force, I am afraid that it would still be unable to treat her.\u201dBu Fang pursed his lips as he glanced at Ji Chengan, who was shaking his head.\u201cHow could the Blood Phoenix Chicken that I cooked be that simple? Don\u2019t talk nonsense if you haven\u2019t tasted it.\u201dJi Chengan was startled as he unhappily looked toward Bu Fang. He was the crown prince, how dare this commoner speak to him in such a manner?Ji Chengxue and the rest had already gotten used to Bu Fang\u2019s character. This fellow was someone who was afraid of nothing. Even if he was facing the crown prince, he would still dare to rebuke him.Xushi\u2019s heart skipped a beat. How could the crown prince, who was used to being treated as a royalty, tolerate Bu Fang\u2019s discourteous words? In order to prevent the situation from worsening, he quickly stood out to mediate.\u201cOwner Bu, since you\u2019re so confident in this chicken soup, you should quickly let miss Yanyu drink it,\u201d Xushi said as he performed a fist and palm salute.Xiao Meng was also slightly frowning as he said to Bu Fang, \u201cBrat, I hope that your chicken soup is effective. Otherwise, you know the consequences.\u201d\u201cRelax, this soup is very effective,\u201d Bu Fang simply replied.He first took a small blue and white porcelain bowl and filled it up with the amber-colored chicken soup using a porcelain spoon. The oil inside the chicken soup was overflowing with lights and colors, and was neither greasy nor mild.\u201cThis chicken soup is called Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup. The main ingredients are the Heavenly Sage Herb and the Blood Phoenix Chicken. Over a dozen valuable medicinal ingredients were added during the cooking process as well. The true energy culinary technique was employed to ensure the essence of the Sage Herb would fully permeate into the chicken soup. It is abundant with spirit energy and supplements blood and life.\u201dAfter Bu Fang gave an introduction, he brought the bowl of chicken soup to the pale and fading Xiao Yanyu.Xiao Yanyu was very beautiful. Even though her skin had lost its luster due to the severe depletion of her life force, it was still unable to conceal her peerless looks. The dim look in her eyes was like the flowers withering in autumn as it elicited pity from others.\u201cOpen your mouth and say ahh,\u201d Bu Fang said to Xiao Yanyu as he scooped a spoonful of fragrant chicken soup that was giving off heat.Xiao Yanyu\u2019s eyelashes trembled as her deteriorating eyes glanced toward the chicken soup. Her lips slightly opened, but due to the depletion of her life force, she found it very difficult to open her mouth.\u201cAhh your head\u2026\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi thought as the corner of her mouth twitched. \u201cIs there something wrong with the smelly boss\u2019 head? Can\u2019t he see that elder sister Yanyu doesn\u2019t even have the strength to open her mouth?\u201dBu Fang poured the contents of the spoon back into the bowl in his hand and expressionlessly looked at Xiao Yanyu.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Why aren\u2019t you feeding the soup to Yanyu?\u201d Xiao Meng puzzledly looked at Bu Fang. The others were feeling curious as well.Bu Fang glanced at them and simply replied, \u201cDon\u2019t rush me. Let me think of a way to feed her.\u201d\u201cEh\u2026 Ah?! What did he mean by that?\u201dEveryone was stunned for a moment, then they watched as Bu Fang drank a spoonful of chicken soup.\u201cWhat is he doing?\u201d \u201cDidn\u2019t he say he was going to feed the chicken soup to Yanyu? Why is he drinking it himself?\u201dThen, Bu Fang leaned forward and lowered his head toward Xiao Yanyu\u2019s mouth\u2026Xiao Meng was glaring at him and his nose was almost crooked from anger. \u201cWhat is this brat doing? Why are you leaning so close to her? Are you trying to take advantage of my daughter?\u201dWhen Bu Fang and Xiao Yanyu\u2019s lips were just an inch away, Xiao Meng was unable to bear it any more and pulled Bu Fang away.\u201cWhat are you trying to do?!\u201d Xiao Meng\u2019s entire body was exuding anger as he coldly stared at Bu Fang.Gulp. Bu Fang expressionlessly looked at Xiao Meng and swallowed the chicken soup in his mouth. He smacked his lips and said, \u201cI am feeding the soup to her. She doesn\u2019t have the strength to open her mouth.\u201d\u201cFrom what you\u2019re saying, it\u2019s as if you were thinking for my daughter\u2026\u201d Xiao Meng bewilderedly thought.\u201cHave you never heard that it\u2019s improper for a man and a woman who aren\u2019t married to have physical contact? Xiaoyi, come over here.\u201d Xiao Meng coldly glared at Bu Fang and beckoned Ouyang Xiaoyi to come over.Ouyang Xiaoyi eagerly ran forward.\u201cYou\u2019ll feed the chicken soup to Yanyu. Just\u2026 follow his method just now.\u201d Xiao Meng coldly snorted as he recalled Bu Fang\u2019s actions just now. He was angry just from thinking about it.Ouyang Xiaoyi nodded. She received the bowl of chicken soup that Bu Fang handed to her and drank a spoonful.\u201cOh!\u201d As the chicken soup entered her mouth, Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s eyes immediately widened as she subconsciously swallowed with a gulp.Everyone was expressionlessly looking at her.\u201cI am testing out the taste for elder sister Yanyu first. Hmm, the taste isn\u2019t bad at all.\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi embarrassedly smiled, then she drank another spoonful and did not swallow it this time.It is fine even if our lips are touching, since we are all good sisters.A mouthful of chicken soup was passed into Xiao Yanyu\u2019s mouth and slowly flowed through her throat into her stomach.Xiao Yanyu\u2019s eyes, that were like flowers withering in autumn, moved slightly. A touch of energy and liveliness seemed to appear within her dead gaze.\u201cContinue, don\u2019t stop,\u201d Bu Fang simply said.And so, Ouyang Xiaoyi passed another mouthful of chicken soup into Xiao Yanyu\u2019s mouth. After three more times, Xiao Yanyu\u2019s eyes finally recovered some liveliness and she was able to drink the chicken soup herself.\u201cIt works!\u201d Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s eyes lit up as he excitedly clenched his fist together.\u201cDon\u2019t be hasty. Continue to feed her the chicken soup. Let her drink another bowl,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly said to Ouyang Xiaoyi and signaled her to continue.Once Xiao Yanyu drank another bowl of chicken soup, Bu Fang stopped Ouyang Xiaoyi from continuing. Xiaoyi\u2019s adorable face was currently swollen and red, and looked extremely cute with her chubby face.She actually drank a spoonful of chicken soup with her cultivation level. She was lucky that she was not having a nosebleed.As Bu Fang was pulling off a drumstick, the jelly-like, spring chicken skin stretched while it was being torn off. However, Bu Fang did not take the chicken skin and instead used a knife to slice off a piece of chicken meat. Then he diced it, mixed it within the chicken soup and continued to feed Xiao Yanyu.After eating an entire drumstick and a few slices of Sage Herb in this manner, Xiao Yanyu\u2019s complexion had become rosy. Her life force that was constantly depleting had stopped as well and the energy and blood within her body had become much more abundant. Even though it was still lacking compared to ordinary people, this result was already much better than before.\u201cA bowl of chicken soup\u2026 was able to treat the injuries that even the imperial physicians were incapable of treating! This\u2026 chicken soup is too magical!\u201d The people in the surroundings were extremely astonished as they whispered among themselves. The suspicions they originally held toward Bu Fang had all disappeared.Xiao Meng was quite shocked as well. However, it was soon replaced by excitement and happiness.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euXiao Yanyu\u2019s complexion was much rosier than before. Even though she was still pale, she had at least gained some liveliness. After recovering some strength, she lightly called out to Xiao Meng, \u201cDad\u2026 I am hungry.\u201dShe really recovered! Xiao Yanyu really recovered with a bowl of chicken soup!Ji Chengan\u2019s eyes lit up like a vast sky full of stars at night as he stared at the chicken soup with a yearning gaze.Ji Chengxue\u2019s eyes were burning brightly as well as he stared at the chicken soup.At that moment, the two princes hankered for the chicken soup.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Wearing a bamboo hat and a straw raincoat with a sword slung behind his back, he was slowly walking toward the store in the alleyway.Suddenly, the figure slightly quivered and stopped walking. It stood at the center of the alleyway and ceased to move.Raindrops fell from the sky and splattered on his bamboo hat. Streams of water gathered from the raindrops flowed down the straw raincoat and dripped off the corners.Xiao Yue\u2019s face was concealed by the black veil of the bamboo hat. His expression could not be seen and his emotions could not be perceived. He did not continue moving, but stopped a few steps away from the store and slowly took off the longsword wrapped in rags slung on his back.\u201cBuzz\u2014\u201dIn the surroundings of the alleyway, a series of sounds\u2014which sounded like the sharp noise that bowstrings make when arrows are fired\u2014suddenly rang out.Schhwaff schhwaff schhwaff\uff01Countless crossbow bolts were suddenly launched from all directions, sailing through the air in a slightly curved angle. The target was Xiao Yue who was standing in the middle of the alleyway.Rip!As a crisp sound rang out, the rags wrapped around the longsword were immediately torn into pieces as a bright sword energy burst forth from the sword. It was like a meteor flying through the night sky as it drew an arc in the air.A surging wave of true energy gushed out from his body and spread out along with the sword energy. The countless crossbow bolts broke into pieces and the fragments, accompanied by the raindrops, scattered onto the ground.As the sword energy dissipated, over a dozen figures with very powerful auras suddenly appeared from behind the walls of the alleyway. Each of them was armed with a spear as they charged toward Xiao Yue.\u201cThe Tiger Guards of the Xiao family\u2026 How nostalgic.\u201dXiao Yue\u2019s hoarse murmuring fluttered in the wind and he seemed to be chuckling to himself. Then the rain surrounding him was instantly expelled, as if a distorted area was formed around him.\u2026\u2026Xiao Meng forcefully suppressed his agitation and only breathed a sigh of relief after he personally fed the chicken soup to Xiao Yanyu. The tremendous weight on his shoulders was finally lifted off.\u201cThank you, Owner Bu,\u201d Xiao Meng solemnly said to Bu Fang as he performed a fist and palm salute.Bu Fang expressionlessly nodded, while thinking, \u201cYou should be thankful.\u201dSuddenly, Bu Fang\u2019s expression changed. He seemed to be hearing a series of metallic collision noises coming from outside the store. He immediately looked outside in uncertainty, but these noises quickly stopped and disappeared.Xiao Meng\u2019s expression remained indifferent. He had naturally heard the sound of combat from outside but did not take any other actions. He continued to unhurriedly feed the chicken soup to Xiao Yanyu.\u201cOwner Bu, this chicken soup\u2026 Would it be possible for me to have a serving?\u201d Ji Chengxue came forward with a gentle smile and asked Bu Fang.Ji Chengan meaningfully looked at Ji Chengxue and stepped forward as well. He was slightly agitated as well as he said, \u201cOwner Bu, give me a serving of this\u2026 Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup!\u201d\u201cThe effects of this Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup had already been proven. If Xiao Yanyu who had lost so much life force was saved after drinking it, then its recuperation effects was definitely powerful. If father could drink a bowl of this soup, then his body would definitely become much stronger. This soup would be great for pleasing father,\u201d Ji Chengan thought.Even though the title of crown prince had already been conferred on him, he still did not dare to relax. His brother, King Yu had already coveted his position for a long time and knew how to please their father, the emperor. He was already feeling threatened at the moment.If he could present this chicken soup to their father, he would definitely improve his father\u2019s impression toward him.\u201cJi Chengxue is definitely having the same idea as well,\u201d Ji Chengan thought. He glanced at his third brother and sneered.Compared to his second brother, his third brother was not a threat at all.\u201cExcuse me, but this Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup is a special dish. It is not for sale,\u201d Bu Fang indifferently replied.The Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup was given by the system so that he could use it to save Xiao Yanyu and not considered within the store\u2019s dishes in the first place.\u201cOwner Bu, crystals aren\u2019t an issue\u2026 I only wish that you would cook another serving of chicken soup,\u201d Ji Chengan unhappily said. When he heard Bu Fang\u2019s reply, he slightly frowned.When Ji Chengxue heard Bu Fang\u2019s words, he did not continue asking. He was very familiar with Bu Fang\u2019s character and knew that the answer would be the same no matter how many times he asked.Bu Fang pointed at the menu behind the crown prince and said, \u201cLook at the menu behind you. This dish isn\u2019t on it, so\u2026 I am not selling.\u201d\u201cHmph! You\u2019re so inflexible. Since I told you to cook the dish, you should just go and do it. Why do you have so much nonsense to say?\u201d Ji Chengan\u2019s expression became gloomy as he swinged his sleeve in anger and coldly said.With those words, the people in the surrounding immediately knew that the crown prince was angry. His temper was notoriously known within the imperial city to be irritable.For the owner of such a small restaurant to infuriate the crown prince, he was definitely going to suffer.Many people of the Xiao family looked toward Bu Fang in sympathy and secretly shook their heads.On the other hand, Xiao Meng and Xiao Xiaolong took no notice. Xiao Meng understood very well how terrifying Bu Fang\u2019s store was. The mechanical puppet, not to mention the big black dog lying at entrance, was not something a mere crown prince could offend.Dadada.The atmosphere within the store had become cold due to the crown prince\u2019s words. However, clear footsteps coming from the entrance attracted their attention.A figure wearing a straw raincoat and a bamboo hat stepped into the store.\u201cOwner Bu, I am here to retrieve the Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine that I reserved,\u201d a hoarse voice faintly rang out as dark red blood dripped off the tip of the longsword that the person was holding and splattered onto the floor.\u201cOh, wait a moment,\u201d Bu Fang nodded and expressionlessly replied. Then he turned around and headed toward the kitchen.\u201cStop!\u201d Ji Chengan\u2019s eyes flashed with malice. How dare this fellow actually ignore him? Who was he? He was the crown prince! How could he let others humiliate him like this?With a bellow, Ji Chengan formed a claw with his hand and reached for Bu Fang\u2019s back figure.Bang!However, before Ji Chengan\u2019s attack was able to reach Bu Fang\u2019s body, it was intercepted by Xiao Meng. Xiao Meng indifferently glanced at the crown prince and said, \u201cYour Highness, it\u2019s better not to make a move within the store. This is an advice from your humble servant.\u201dAfter Xiao Meng finished speaking, his gaze turned toward the man wearing the bamboo hat and his expression turned cold.\u201cYou really dare to appear,\u201d Xiao Meng ghastly said as a killing intent gradually emitted from his body.\u201cFather, your tiger guards are still as worthless as before.\u201d Xiao Yue remained as steady as a mountain under Xiao Meng\u2019s killing intent. He chuckled with a hoarse voice as he took off the bamboo hat and revealed a handsome face.Xiao Yue?! The Heart-rending Sword Monarch Xiao Yue!Everyone within the store sucked in a breath of cold air. Even the the crown prince who was furious at the moment narrowed his eyes.The vicious person who severely injured his mother and betrayed his father for the sake of mastering the sword!\u201cYanyu was injured because of you. You should know that you would definitely die this time around\u2026 I thought you already escaped.\u201d Xiao Meng slowly walked toward Xiao Yue. He was moving very slowly, but his aura became even more terrifying with each step.With every step, the terrifying aura of a seventh grade Battle-Saint covered the entire area with a loud rumble.\u201cDie? Father, you\u2019re still as confident as ever,\u201d Xiao Yue said with a faint smile. His eyes were almost narrowed into a crescent shape, but his words were unrestrained. \u201cUnfortunately, you won\u2019t be able to stop the current me.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t stop you?\u201d Xiao Meng thought as he stopped walking. The distance between them was only an inch and their eyes were looking at each other.Xiao Meng\u2019s aura was as heavy as a towering mountain range, while Xiao Yue\u2019s aura was as sharp as divine spear that could rend the sky.Just as the collision between the two of them was about to occur.At that very moment\u2026\u201cHey, here\u2019s your Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAn indifferent voice suddenly interrupted their confrontation.Everyone immediately looked in astonishment toward Bu Fang who had just walked out of the kitchen with a jar of wine in his hands.\u201cThis fellow\u2026 Is there something wrong with his head? Doesn\u2019t he understand the current situation? Why are you mentioning wine at this kind of moment?\u201dBoth the gazes of Xiao Meng and Xiao Yue landed on Bu Fang.Bu Fang remained expressionless as he calmly received their sharp gazes. He twitched his mouth and said, \u201cLet me remind you\u2026 Go outside if you\u2019re going to fight or cause trouble. Otherwise\u2026 you will be stripped as an example to others.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Does he have the strength and qualifications to say that?\u201dJi Chengan could tell Bu Fang\u2019s cultivation level just from looking at him. A mere third grade Battle-Maniac could not even be considered as an ant in front of a Battle-Saint. Where did he get the courage to say those words?Ji Chengan folded his arms across his chest as he looked on with interest. He was looking forward to watching Bu Fang being taught a lesson.Other than the crown prince, many members of the Xiao family were looking at Bu Fang in the same manner. In their eyes, this brat was simply an idiot with poor judgement.Both the gazes of Xiao Meng and Xiao Yue were like blades as they coldly landed on Bu Fang\u2019s body. The atmosphere within the store became much colder.Bu Fang was expressionlessly holding the jar of Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine in one hand while patting Whitey\u2019s wide belly with the other. Whitey had appeared next to him without anyone noticing and its mechanical eyes were flashing red.Both the gazes of Xiao Yue and Xiao Meng slightly shifted toward Whitey\u2019s body. \u201cThis mechanical puppet\u2026\u201dThe mood became tense. Just when everyone thought Bu Fang was about to suffer a misfortune, Xiao Meng lightly exhaled. He turned around and walked toward the entrance of the store.\u201cI\u2019ll give Owner Bu some face today. Come out with me, we\u2019ll settle this outside.\u201dThe corner of Xiao Yue\u2019s mouth curled up and his expression became languid.\u201cWhy should I go out just because you\u2019re telling me? Wouldn\u2019t that make me lose face?\u201d Xiao Yue walked toward Bu Fang and received the jar of wine from him.Xiao Meng stopped walking and looked back. He lifted up his hand and a burst of true energy gushed out from his hand. It turned into a stream and instantly coiled around the jar of wine in Xiao Yue\u2019s hand.With a slight tug, the Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine flew across the air toward Xiao Meng.Xiao Yue\u2019s pupils constricted as the aura emitting from his body suddenly changed. He tossed out a stream of energy as well, coiling it around the jar of wine.\u201cI said, if you\u2019re going to cause trouble\u2026 get out,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly said when he saw that the two were once again about to fight.Both Xiao Yue and Xiao Meng angrily snorted at the same time as they dashed out of the store and appeared within the alleyway.How terrifying! With the two of them gone, the atmosphere within the store immediately relaxed. Everyone was panting heavily with frightful expressions on their faces.The crown prince, Ji Chengan, looked toward Bu Fang in incredulity. Xiao Yue and Xiao Meng actually listened to that fellow and went outside to fight\u2026 This was contrary to his expectations and completely different from his anticipation.\u201cHe\u2026 What is he relying on?!\u201d Ji Chengan heavily breathed out and said with a frown.Xushi sighed. The crown prince did not know the terror of the store at all. He did not understand the terror of the iron lump puppet at all.The others were looking at Bu Fang as if he was a monster as well. This little store owner actually forced a Battle-Saint to compromise.\u201cWhat are you looking at? The opening hours for today has already ended. Please leave the store right now,\u201d Bu Fang glanced at them and expressionlessly ordered them to leave. He did not care about their astonished gazes in the slightest.\u201cOwner Bu, my\u2026\u201d\u201cI already said\u2026 This dish is not for sale. If you really want to eat this dish, you can prepare your own ingredients and bring them over,\u201d Before the crown prince could finish speaking, Bu Fang immediately interrupted him.The crown prince was slightly furious that he was interrupted, but his eyes lits up from Bu Fang\u2019s words. If he brought his own ingredients, Bu Fang would be willing to accept the order?Other than Ji Chengan, the eyes of Ji Chengxue and the others lit up as well.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll be leaving then.\u201d After receiving the confirmation from Bu Fang, the crown prince was overjoyed as he turned around and left the store with Xushi. He was in a hurry to watch the battle between Xiao Meng and Xiao Yue.The others left in droves as well. The battle between Xiao Meng and Xiao Yue was a rare occurrence that they could not afford to miss.Xiao Xiaolong ordered the servants to carry Xiao Yanyu, whose injuries had already recovered but was still tired, and left as well.With the blink of an eye, most of the people had already left and the store became deserted once more.\u201cSmelly boss, I am leaving as well. I will come back tomorrow.\u201d A smile appeared on Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s face as her eyes narrowed into slits. The smelly boss really did not lie to her and really saved elder sister Yanyu.Bu Fang did not pay any attention to her as he turned around and entered the kitchen. Ouyang Xiaoyi stuck her tongue out at Bu Fang\u2019s figure and left while skipping.That night, it was inevitable that the imperial city would not be quiet.The Heart-rending Sword Monarch appeared within the imperial city and had an intense fight with Great General Xiao.According to witnesses, the two experts seemed to be fighting over a jar of wine. They fought from the eastern side of the city to the western side, then back again to the eastern side. From the beginning to the end, the two remained in a deadlock as they fought over a jar of wine.Great General Xiao\u2019s military prowess was unrivalled, while the Heart-rending Sword Monarch was capable of splitting the sky with a single sword strike. The battle between the two sent huge ripples through the imperial city and caused the situation, that was already turbulent, to become more unpredictable.This battle caused the experts from the sects hiding within the capital to appear one by one. There were suddenly big and small battles erupting in various alleyways within the imperial city. The innumerable bursts of true energy were like gorgeous fireworks.However, none of these were related to Bu Fang in the slightest.After closing up the store, Bu Fang went into the kitchen. No matter how chaotic the outside became, the interior of the store would always be serene. All he needed to do was testing out the new dishes.\u201cCongratulations to the host for completing the abrupt mission: Learn the cooking method of Elixir Cuisine, the Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup, and rescue the dying beauty. The system reward will now be released.\u201d\u201cThe system reward has been released. Will the host please check the contents.\u201dAs the system solemn\u2019s voice rang out in Bu Fang\u2019s mind, his eyes immediately light up and his mind settled down.\u201cSystem reward: Oyster Pancake that is available for takeouts.\u201d\u201cOyster Pancake should be a type of snack,\u201d Bu Fang thought as the system had indicated that the Oyster Pancake is available for takeout. From what he knew of the system\u2019s character, a main dish would definitely not be allowed.\u201cSo that\u2019s the kind of reward I get for slogging for half a day\u2026\u201d Bu Fang thought as he felt an inexplicable pity for himself.\u201cOyster Pancake is a characteristic snack. It is made using rice milk, shredded radish, oyster, chopped onion, minced meat and various other ingredients. It is deep-fried using special methods. The taste is delicious and has a rich aftertaste and fragrance that lingers in your mouth.\u201dBu Fang had never tried cooking the Oyster Pancake on earth before, so he was quite interested in this new dish as well.And so, while the battle outside was continuing, Bu Fang was joyously preparing to test out the new dish in the kitchen.The ingredients of the Oyster Pancake were prepared by the system and stored within a separate cupboard. Bu Fang took out a luscious white radish, which had a better quality than the ones that Bu Fang used in his knife skill training.Just from holding the white radish in his hand, he could feel the rich spirit energy and juice inside.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSlicing radishes was naturally not an issue for Bu Fang. After turning the radish into long, thin strips, he placed them on one side. He took out a piece of meat, turned it into minced meat and placed it into a small bowl. The onion was chopped and then the plump oysters were washed clean.The oysters used were not ordinary as well. According to the system, they were the highest grade oysters obtained from the coastal area of the Southern Wastelands. Filled with an abundant amount of spirit energy, they were an excellent ingredient.After he finished preparing the ingredients, Bu Fang started to prepare the rice milk. He needed to pay particular attention to the rice milk as it should not be too watery or too thick.If the rice milk was too watery, the Oyster Pancake would easily break into pieces. On the other hand, if the rice milk was too thick, the Oyster Pancake would become too hard and affect the taste.Taking out a miniature millstone from a cupboard, Bu Fang loosened his muscles and bones to get ready to personally grind the rice milk.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Every single grain was round and plump like pearls, and filled with an abundant amount of spirit energy.He scooped up a ladle of rice and poured it into the millstone. After adding a ladle of peanut and water, Bu Fang began to gently turn the millstone. This millstone was relatively primitive and its surface was somewhat glossy.After gently milling for a while, slightly thick rice milk began to flow out into the blue and white porcelain bowl that Bu Fang placed beneath the millstone.After collecting the rice milk that he needed, Bu Fang cleaned the millstone and took out a wok. He filled half of the wok with high quality oil, turned on the stove and waited for the temperature of the oil to rise.The wok spatula used to deep fry Oyster Pancakes had a special shape. It was not semicircle like normal wok spatulas but was slightly flat instead.After adding a layer of rice milk on the flat surface of the wok spatula, he spread the shredded radish and chopped onion on top of the layer of rice milk. After adding two more layers of rice milk and minced meat in between, he placed a plump oyster at the top and added another layer of rice milk to wrap up all the ingredients, creating a hemisphere shape.Once the temperature of the oil within the wok was hot enough to scald, he dipped the wok spatula containing the Oyster Pancake into the oil. Immediately, the oil was spattering everywhere and pale yellowish bubbles were forming around the rice milk.As the Oyster Pancake couldn\u2019t be flipped during the deep frying process, it tested the chef\u2019s control over the heat and timing. The taste would be affected whether it was too raw or overcooked.Once the exterior of the Oyster Pancake had completely turned into a golden color, Bu Fang took it out from the wok and placed it into the wire netting he had already prepared to drain the oil.A hemisphere-shaped Oyster Pancake was completed once the oil was completely drained.As the rice milk was not too thick, the ingredients inside of the golden crust were still visible and lines could be seen. The fragrance of deep fried food was exuding from the Oyster Pancake and had a very unique smell.As peanut was added during the milling process, the rice milk was particularly fragrant after it was deep fried. Moreover, the residual heat from the oil and the rice milk crust caused the ingredients to be naturally cooked and allowed the fragrance to complement each other. More importantly, the aroma of the oyster which contained a trace of ocean flavor would linger around the tip of one\u2019s nose and was difficult to disperse.Bu Fang was already feeling famished when he saw the Oyster Pancake. While another Oyster Pancake was still being deep fried, he picked up the Oyster Pancake that was finished and eagerly took a bite.Crunch\u2026The crispy texture, the rich taste, and the savory juice from the shredded white radish instantly entered his mouth and enveloped it. It was like the delicious taste had directly rushed into his brain as the pores in his whole body slightly opened.Crispy, fragrant, delicious! Only these three words could describe this Oyster Pancake. After taking the first bite, one would be unable to help but take the second bite. With this second bite, Bu Fang tasted the meat. The flavor of the meat instantly burst forth and directly rushed into the depths of his heart.With a third bite, Bu Fang tasted the plump oyster. The oyster was not deep fried as it was wrapped within the rice milk, so it retained the fresh taste of seafood. Accompanied with the shredded radish and minced meat, it was so delicious that he wanted to swallow his own tongue.The taste of the Oyster Pancake\u2026 was unexpectedly delicious!Bu Fang endured the urge to completely finish the entire Oyster Pancake and took out the other Oyster Pancake from the wok to drain the oil.After deep frying three Oyster Pancakes, Bu Fang did not continue further.The Oyster Pancake needed to be eaten immediately. If it was left unattended for too long, the juice of the radish and steam would cause the crust to soften and lose that crispiness, which would affect the taste.After finishing three Oyster Pancakes, Bu Fang was still slightly craving for more. His mouth was filled with the taste of the Oyster Pancakes and he was overwhelmed with the urge to taste more.He cleaned up the kitchen and returned to his room to sleep. During normal circumstances, he would maintain his sleep habits.The next day, the weather was clear and the sun was shining warmly.Bu Fang accidentally overslept a little, so he got up slightly later than usual. However, it was not a big deal.After washing up, Bu Fang opened up the store. There was already a line of people waiting outside and Fatty Jin and his buddies were already waiting for quite some time.\u201cOh my, Owner Bu, you are slightly slower today,\u201d Fatty Jin grumbled, but the expression on his face was still very happy. He was already used to eating breakfast at Bu Fang\u2019s restaurant every morning and according to him, \u201cIt was the greatest happiness to eat Bu Fang\u2019s dishes once everyday.\u201d\u201cYes, I was preparing a new dish, that\u2019s why I was slightly slower than usual,\u201d Bu Fang unabashedly said.\u201cA new dish?\u201d Fatty Jin was immediately excited when he heard that. He turned his head to look at the menu on the wall and saw that there was indeed a new dish at the bottom.\u201cOyster Pancake, two per serving, five crystals (takeout permitted).\u201d\u201cOyster Pancake? I\u2019ve never heard of this dish before,\u201d Fatty Jin thought as he went into a daze. \u201cIt seems to be very awesome from the sound of it.\u201d\u201cThen owner, I would like to have a serving of this Oyster Pancake,\u201d Fatty Jin readily said. He was a nouveau riche and did not lack money.\u201cYou can order other dishes first, then ordered the Oyster Pancake as takeout and eat while walking,\u201d Bu Fang reminded him.Fatty Jin immediately realized his mistake as he nodded and ordered other dishes.After memorizing the orders, Bu Fang turned around and entered the kitchen and began to prepare the dishes.Ouyang Xiaoyi skipped into the store. Even though she no longer needed to work as the waitress, she was still habitually coming to work.Bu Fang was not opposed to this either and allowed her to do as she pleased.\u201cXiaoyi, isn\u2019t it an important day for the Ouyang family? Why are you still working today?\u201d While Fatty Jin was waiting for his food to arrive, he was slightly bored and started chatting with Ouyang Xiaoyi.\u201cEh? Is there something big happening?\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi was startled.Fatty Jin continued and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not really that big of a deal. It\u2019s already spread within the entire imperial city that His Majesty ordered Great General Xiao Meng and General Ouyang to jointly host today\u2019s execution. They\u2019re executing those experts from the sects at the Gate of Heavenly Mystery.\u201d\u201cI know, right? I heard the leaders from the Death Soul Palace are all sixth grade Battle-Emperors\u2026 They\u2019re actually going to be executed together. The entire empire was shocked by the news. This time His Majesty is really determined to intimidate those sects outside of the border.\u201d\u201cOld Jin, let me tell you. I am afraid that this execution won\u2019t proceed smoothly. Didn\u2019t a great battle occur between Great General Xiao and the Heart-rending Sword Monarch yesterday? Do you know what happened? The Heart-rending Sword Monarch actually escaped!\u201d\u201cOther than the mysterious Celestial Arcanum Sect, experts from the other nine great sects have all gathered within the imperial city to stop today\u2019s execution. I am afraid that an earth-shaking battle will happen today! Have you not noticed that there are several times more guards within the imperial city than usual?\u201d\u2026When Ouyang Xiaoyi heard the discussion of the customers, she suddenly became absent-minded. She thought, \u201cAccording to what they\u2019re saying, doesn\u2019t that mean father and elder brothers would be in danger?\u201d\u201cXiaoyi, serve the dishes,\u201d Bu Fang\u2019s indifferent voice drifted out from the kitchen and interrupted Xiaoyi\u2019s thoughts.When Fatty Jin and the rest finished their meals, Bu Fang had also finished deep frying the Oyster Pancake.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThere were six people within this group of obese men and each of them ordered a serving of Oyster Pancakes. With a dozen of Oyster Pancakes, they had to wait for quite a while.\u201cThis is the Oyster Pancake? It\u2019s so fragrant!\u201d Fatty Jin looked at the two pieces of Oyster Pancake wrapped in bamboo leaves in his hands and swallowed his saliva. The golden Oyster Pancake was exuding a rich fragrance that stimulated his appetite.Bringing along their fascination toward the Oyster Pancake, the group left Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store.\u201cOld Jin, why don\u2019t we take a look at the execution grounds? Six Battle-Emperors are being executed, there\u2019s no way we can miss such a grand occasion,\u201d one of them said and the rest immediately agreed.And so, a group of obese men was holding Oyster Pancakes in their hands as they majestically headed for the execution grounds, planning to eat along the way, and became clueless Oyster-Pancake-eating spectators.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

These group of people were all well-known people within the imperial city. Along with their followers, they were waiting to enter the Gate of Heavenly Mystery within the imperial palace.There were countless armor-wearing soldiers standing guard at the entrance to the imperial palace. Every single person that entered would go through an inspection.This time, the orders from the emperor to execute the prisoners from Death Soul Palace had aroused the interest of many people and created huge ripples within the imperial city. The court officials were not the only ones who did not expect it, but even the experts from sects outside the border were caught unprepared.Fatty Jin and his buddies majestically arrived. However, as they were not court officials, they did not have the authority to go by the backdoor and could only obediently queue up.However, their luck was excellent. Just when they arrived, the first wave of spectators were allowed to enter. And so, they followed the crowd and Fatty Jin carried the Oyster Pancakes into the Gate of Heavenly Mystery.The Gate of Heavenly Mystery Square was specially built by the imperial palace. Its surface area was large and wide, and many important ceremonies and events, like the imperial sacrifices, were conducted there.On that day, the atmosphere within the Gate of Heavenly Mystery was extremely cold. An execution platform was set up in the middle and was surrounded by guards that were there to maintain order.On the execution platform, there was a judicial desk made from sandalwood and two high chairs. Xiao Meng, who was fully armored, was sitting upright on one of the chairs. His red cloak was fluttering in the wind, like a rolling sea of blood.Ouyang Zongheng was also wearing armor. His long hair was tied with a black woolen rope while two bangs of hair were drifting with the wind in front of his forehead. His gaze was solemn while his expression was cold.The two of them were like statues as they sat on top of the high chairs. Regardless of the chilliness of the autumn wind, their expressions were still that cold.Suddenly, Ouyang Zongheng raised his head and looked at the sky. The clouds were slowly moving due to the autumn wind blowing, but could never block the radiance released by the scorching sun.\u201cIt\u2019s time, bring the prisoners to the execution platform.\u201dWith a solemn expression, Ouyang Zongheng\u2019s indifferent voice resounded around the entire Gate of Heavenly Mystery, causing the clamoring audience to become silent as they gravely looked toward the execution platform.The sound of chains colliding rang out. From a distance, guards were escorting six men with disheveled hair in prisoner clothes while they slowly approached. Their hands and feet were bound by cold shackles.\u2026As Fatty Jin ripped the bamboo leaves, the golden and slightly hot Oyster Pancake was revealed. The rich fragrance drifted out and dispersed through the surroundings, causing the spectators around him to sniff the air.A smile appeared on Fatty Jin\u2019s face as he intoxicatedly inhaled the smell and the pudgy flesh on his face was slightly trembling from happiness.\u201cOwner Bu\u2019s dishes are definitely the best. With such a sweet fragrance, the taste is definitely delicious as well,\u201d Fatty Jin thought as he opened his mouth and took a bite.Crunch! A clear sound rang out. The crispy texture caused Fatty Jin\u2019s eyes to open wide in astonishment. After the crispiness, it was the tenderness and juiciness of the shredded radishes that flowed into his mouth. Immediately, an indescribable aroma flooded his mouth and even gushed out from his nostrils.\u201cOh, my heavens! It\u2019s so delicious!\u201d Fatty Jin was enthralled as he took another bite. With this second bite, he tasted the meat and the aroma abruptly upgraded to the next level.Gulp!Even Fatty Jin did not expect that with the two bites, the fragrance of the Oyster Pancake would immediately diffuse. That fragrance was like silk brushing across skin as it drifted into the air with the help of the autumn wind.The rest of the obese men could not help it any longer and ripped open their own Oyster Pancakes. As they each bit down on the Oyster Pancakes, a series of crunching sounds rang out and lingered around a corner of the Gate of Heavenly Mystery.A burst of fragrance might not be concentrated enough. However, if several bursts of fragrance were released at the same time, and with the help of the autumn wind, it would turn into a surging wave.The fragrance of the Oyster Pancake was like an aroma bomb. With several aromatic explosions happening at the same time, the entire Gate of Heavenly Mystery began to clamor.\u201cWhat the?! This smell\u2026 Who\u2019s releasing poison at the execution grounds?!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s so fragrant! It\u2019s really fragrant! How could it possibly be so fragrant?!\u201d\u201cAre you still human! Is this the sort of place to eat delicious food? I just want to say\u2026 Give me a serving as well!\u201d\u2026The Gate of Heavenly Mystery was in complete chaos. Everyone was constantly looking for the source of the fragrance. They had never smelled such a sweet fragrance.The guards immediately increased their vigilance. However, as they inhaled the fragrance, they could not help but swallow their salivas as well. This smell seemed to possess magical powers as it instantly infiltrated their marrows.Crunch\u2026 Fatty took another bite of the Oyster Pancake. Immediately, he became intoxicated once more as he tasted the plump oyster. He opened his mouth to exhale and the fragrance gushed out.\u201cGet lost! Don\u2019t eat in front of me\u2026\u201d A sullen voice rang out next to Fatty Jin. The cold voice seemed to have permeated from the netherworlds.Fatty Jin was startled. When he turned his head, he saw a man that looked slightly ugly standing next to him. The man was swallowing his saliva while looking at him with a cold gaze.\u201cWho the hell are you? So what if I am eating, how is it any of your business? I am going to continue eating, what are you going to do about it?\u201d Fatty Jin said as he took another bite of Oyster Pancake and snorted.The ugly man fiercely glared at Fatty Jin and clenched his fist tightly, as if he was going to smash Fatty Jin\u2019s annoying face.However, when the man thought about the sect\u2019s plans later, he suppressed his anger and coldly glanced at Fatty Jin and said, \u201cDamn fatty, just you wait!\u201d\u201cOh hoh! You\u2019re even threatening me. I am definitely going to eat in front of you today, why don\u2019t you bite me!\u201d Fatty Jin said as he finished the rest of the Oyster Pancake with a single bite. Then he took out the second Oyster Pancake from the bamboo leaves and brandished it in front of the man.The man took a deep breath and the blue veins on his fists became apparent.At that moment, the six prisoners were already kneeling down on the execution platform with their heads hanging down. Beside each of the prisoners, there was a burly executioner with red scarves wrapped around their heads. They looked boorish and exuded powerful auras. Every single one of them was a fourth grade Battle-Spirit.The spectating crowd became quiet once more. The temperature within the Gate of Heavenly Mystery seemed to have become much colder in that moment as a killing intent instantly burst out from the center of the execution platform.Xiao Meng glanced toward the scorching sun. Then with a wave of his hand, a token made from black iron immediately floated up from the judicial desk. The word \u201cbehead\u201d was inscribed upon it.Just when he was about to throw the token, he suddenly sensed something and puzzledly looked toward the direction of the crowd.\u201cDamn fatty! Ahh! I am going to kill you!\u201dA roar filled with anger and grief rang out as a terrifying true energy burst out from that location.\u201cHmm? Soul refinement true energy from the Soul Sect?\u201d Xiao Meng muttered as his eyes narrowed and briefly flashed for a moment.Following the initial outburst, sources of true energy started appearing one by one among the spectators gathered at the Gate of Heavenly Mystery and were followed by bone chilling shouts.The levels of the true energy were extremely powerful. Each of them were at the level of a fifth grade Battle-King.Without a doubt, the experts from the sects were making their move!However, Xiao Meng and Ouyang Zongheng were both slightly baffled as the timing utilized by the experts from the sects was strange\u2026Bang bang bang!One by one, the Tiger Guards of the Xiao family standing near the execution platform charged into the crowd toward the source of the auras.Fatty Jin\u2019s face went pale while the pudgy flesh throughout his entire body began to tremble as he looked toward the ugly man, who seemed as if he had just instantly become a towering mountain.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cElder brother\u2026 I won\u2019t mess around anymore\u2026 You can eat this Oyster Pancake\u2026\u201d\u201cEat?!

With the sonorous cry of a sword, Xiao Yue\u2019s body flew into the air as true energy surged out from him. His figure immediately charged toward the execution platform, leaving a contrail at his wake.Hun Qianduan\u2019s expression became sullen and he coldly snorted. The tip of his toes tapped against the ground and he flew into the air. His black robes spread open and soul refinement true energy surged out.At the center of the execution platform, Xiao Meng\u2019s eyes narrowed as he raised his head and looked toward the two figures approaching. He slapped the table and angrily yelled with a voice like rolling thunder as it dispersed into a distance.\u201cYou fiend! I wasn\u2019t able to kill you yesterday, but you won\u2019t be able to get away today!\u201dBoom!The terrifying aura of a seventh grade Battle-Saint suddenly skyrocketed as Xiao Meng turned into a stream of light and charged toward Xiao Yue and Hun Qianduan.The corner of Ouyang Zongheng\u2019s mouth widened into a smile as he fiercely stomped the ground and charged out. He landed on the execution platform and knocked away two experts from the sects that were charging toward the platform with a sudden palm strike.\u201cWith I, Ouyang Zongheng, overseeing this execution, who has the audacity to be impudent?!\u201dWithin the crowd, powerful auras continued to appear. The Tiger Guards of the Xiao family had already made contact and were fighting with the experts from the sects. The sound of battle could be heard throughout the Gate of Heavenly Mystery as it suddenly turned into a field of blood.\u2026Deep within the resplendent imperial palace, an elderly figure was sitting on the dragon throne with a white-haired eunuch in robes standing next to him, with his head lowered.The elderly figure was wearing a purple crown embedded with gems with his hair tied up and a golden headband embroidered with an illustration of two dragons vying for a pearl[1]. Even though his appearance was old, the domineering aura of an emperor was still present.\u201cIs the matter of the Gate of Heavenly Mystery proceeding smoothly?\u201d A slightly low voice came from the emperor\u2019s mouth.\u201cYour Majesty, Great General Xiao and General Ouyang have already begun the execution.

Even if they\u2019re not completely destroyed, it should be enough to greatly damage them\u2026 Cough, cough, cough.\u201d\u2026The battle at the Gate of Heavenly Mystery was extremely harsh. The number of experts from the sects that infiltrated was slightly out of the expectation of Xiao Meng and the others. The soldier standing guard at the entrance had also been slaughtered as countless experts charged in.Xiao Meng was unmatched in indomitability as he faced the Battle-Emperor Xiao Yue along with the peak-level Battle-Emperor Hun Qianduan, and actually managed to suppress both of them to the point where they could only passively defend.Ouyang Zongheng faced numerous enemies as he aggressively protected the execution platform and prevented anyone from approaching. As the experts from the sects charged into the fray, the imperial guards joined the battle as well. The two armies started fighting.There were experts appearing on both sides of the forces. As the battle became even harsher, warm blood continued to spray onto the tiles of the solemn Gate of Heavenly Mystery.\u201cFiends from the sects, it\u2019s time for you to die!\u201dJust when everyone was fighting, a high-pitched angry yell came from the depths of the imperial palace. A white-haired figure flew out, lightly waved a horsetail whisk, and joined the battle.Xiao Yue\u2019s expression changed and he was startled, \u201cChief Eunuch, Lian Fu! Isn\u2019t he always protecting the emperor? He actually made a move as well!\u201dHun Qianduan\u2019s expression was unsightly as well as he quietly cursed. The cultivation level of the Chief of the Eunuchs was comparable to Xiao Meng. With both of them working together, even though they had more Battle-Emperors on their side, there was still no chance of winning.\u201cAs expected, this is Ji Changfeng\u2019s trap! We\u2019ve been deceived! Let\u2019s retreat!\u201d\u2026\u201cSmelly boss, since there\u2019s no customers around today, can I go back earlier?\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi asked Bu Fang, who was curled up on a chair near the entrance, with a pout on her face.There were indeed less customers than usual. After Fatty Jin and his buddies left, only a few other customers sporadically turned up. His regular customers like Ji Chengxue and the others did not appear at all.\u201cAlright, you can go back first,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly replied. It was comfortably warm under the autumn sun and it was making him drowsy.When Ouyang Xiaoyi heard Bu Fang\u2019s reply, her eyes started smiling. She charmingly nodded, then impatiently dashed out of the store and headed for the Gate of Heavenly Mystery.After hearing the discussion between Fatty Jin and his buddies, she had been feeling restless. After all, her father was one of the people in charge of the execution. If what they said was true, then her father would be in danger.She lightly sighed as she was about to walk out of the alleyway. However, just as she reached the entrance, she felt a terrifying aura surging toward her.Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s expression immediately changed. Without even thinking about anything, her body automatically turned around and headed the way she came from.However, before she could take a second step, she discovered that a figure had appeared next to her. Then she felt a powerful arm grabbing hold of her and lifting her up.\u201cXiao Meng! Stop! Otherwise, I\u2019ll kill the young lady of the Ouyang family!\u201dXiao Yue hoarsely shouted. He was bleeding all over his body and the smell of blood was even wafting out from his mouth. His eyes were like those of a fierce wolf as he glanced toward his pursuers: Xiao Meng and the white-haired eunuch, Lian Fu.Hun Qianduan\u2019s chest had deeply caved in and there was not even the slightest color on his pale face.\u201cRetreat into the alleyway. Do you see the store there? Go inside,\u201d Xiao Yue indifferently said toward Hun Qianduan while clutching Ouyang Xiaoyi with one hand.Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s adorable face was rosy red as she randomly flailed her limbs around. While panting with rage, she angrily scolded, \u201cXiao Yue! Let me down this instant!\u201dXiao Yue did not have the leisure to pay any attention to Ouyang Xiaoyi. His eyes were coldly watching the movements of Xiao Meng and Lian Fu as he retreated toward the entrance of the store with Hun Qianduan.Bu Fang\u2019s eyes had just closed when he heard Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s unique way of cursing. Immediately, he puzzledly opened his eyes and saw Xiao Yue, who was injured all over and carrying Ouyang Xiaoyi, and a man who looked like a ghost, charging into the store.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBu Fang was slightly startled. What was going on?Xiao Yue let go of Ouyang Xiaoyi as he collapsed onto the ground and continuously vomited blood. He hurriedly took out an elixir from his bosoms and swallowed it, stabilizing his injuries.Only after doing all of this, Xiao Yue smiled at Bu Fang with a pale complexion.\u201cOwner Bu, someone is causing trouble in your store\u2026 Are you going to intervene?\u201d[1] Golden headband embroidered with an illustration of two dragons vying for a pearl \u2013 This is an accessory that originated from the Spring and Autumn Warring States period.

However, he was still forcing himself to smile as he looked at Bu Fang.\u201cOwner Bu, someone is causing trouble in the store\u2026 Are you going to intervene?\u201dHun Qianduan, whose face was as white as paper, looked toward Xiao Yue as if he was looking at a madman, while thinking, \u201cThis fellow\u2026 Is he injured in the head? What kind of nonsense is he spouting? There\u2019s two seventh grade Battle-Saints right outside! What is he trying to do by asking the owner of a store for help?\u201d\u201cHave you gone mad?! Cough\u2026 This guy is only a Battle-Maniac. Do you really think he can help us?\u201d Hun Qianduan was coughing blood as he shook his head in despair and said.This time, the nine great sects had really suffered an immense loss. At least half of their experts were killed during the rescue operation. They did not expect that Ji Changfeng would be that vicious!\u201cShut up! If your useless subordinate didn\u2019t expose his identity beforehand\u2026 Would the result of this operation turn out like this? Your Soul Sect will be taking responsibility for the failure of this operation!\u201d Xiao Yue\u2019s eyes went cold as he glanced at Hun Qianduan. \u201cRight now, I don\u2019t want to argue with you. If you want to continue living, then you should obediently shut up. This store isn\u2019t as simple as you think!\u201d\u201cYou!\u201dHun Qianduan was so riled up that the injuries at his chest began to ache. He could not bear it any longer and coughed out a large mouthful of blood once more. He hurriedly fished out elixirs from his bosom and shoved them into his mouth.Xiao Yue turned around and looked at Bu Fang with hope in his eyes. He knew that his only chance of survival was to rely on Bu Fang.Bu Fang was curled up on a chair. With the sunlight shining on his face, he looked slightly holy.Ouyang Xiaoyi was panting with rage as she hid behind Bu Fang and angrily glared at Xiao Yue. She thought, \u201cThis bad man\u2026 He actually dared to lift me up! And even said he would kill me! Simply unforgivable!\u201dBu Fang expressionlessly stared at Xiao Yue, while Xiao Yue calmly looked back at him.Finally, it seemed that Xiao Yue could not stand Bu Fang\u2019s indifferent gaze any longer. His heart quivered and he could not help but look away.Bu Fang satisfactorily nodded and thought, \u201cThat\u2019s right, who\u2019s afraid of a staring contest!\u201d\u201cOwner Bu?\u201d A deep voice came from outside the store. Xiao Meng, who was in armor, vigorously approached with a solemn expression.\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Bu Fang puzzledly looked at him.\u201cOwner Bu, criminals wanted by the imperial court entered your store just now. I desire to enter your store to catch them.\u201d Xiao Meng was slightly fearful of the mysterious store.An owner with an unknown background, a mysterious and powerful big black dog, and a puppet that was a match for a Battle-Saint\u2026 If he tried to forcibly enter, it probably would not end well.Lian Fu was baffled as he looked at Xiao Meng. Swinging his horsetail whisk and pinching his thumb and index finger together[1], he said with a high-pitched voice, \u201cGeneral Xiao, why aren\u2019t we going in to catch the fiends from the sects that are hiding inside? Don\u2019t tell me you still consider that fiend as your son?\u201d\u201cGong gong[2], you don\u2019t understand\u2026 This store isn\u2019t simple. Forcibly entering is inadvisable!\u201d Xiao Meng solemnly said.\u201cGeneral Xiao\u2026 How could a mere store situated within the alleyways of the imperial city frighten you like this? This doesn\u2019t seem to tally with the reputation of the valiant general of our Light Wind Empire.\u201d Lian Fu sneered as he gestured toward Xiao Meng while pinching his thumb and index finger together.\u201cWho\u2019re you trying to deceive? There are countless stores like this within the imperial city. You can tell the cultivation level of the owner in a single glance. He\u2019s just a mere Battle-Maniac, what\u2019s there for you to be afraid of? Is there a need for a Battle-Saint like you to hesitate?\u201d Lian Fu thought.Bu Fang expressionlessly looked toward Xiao Meng and that\u2026 eunuch.\u201cEh\u2026 Eunuch?\u201d Bu Fang thought as he blinked. It was the first time that he had seen a live eunuch. \u201cHow amazing.\u201d\u201cYou can enter the store, but fighting and causing trouble is prohibited. Otherwise, you will know the consequences,\u201d Bu Fang simply said.Xiao Meng knitted his eyebrows together. If he was not allowed to make a move, how could he capture Xiao Yue? Even though Xiao Yue was badly injured, it would still be difficult to arrest him if he tried to resist.\u201cOh my! Just because we\u2019re showing respect to you, you really think that you\u2019re something\u2026 A mere Battle-Maniac that as arrogant as an eighth grade War-God. Oh, I am so scared.\u201dBefore Xiao Meng could reply, Lian Fu scornfully said as he pinched his thumb and middle finger together and gestured toward Bu Fang while his other hand was propped under his chin.Bu Fang instantly felt goosebumps all over his body\u2026 He thought, \u201cGood heavens\u2026 Elder brother, isn\u2019t it better for us to talk it out?\u201dShua shua shua!While they were talking, several figures appeared within the alleyway.Ouyang Zongheng valiantly arrived with an unmatchable domineering aura while his ferocious face was trembling with fury. At the execution platform, he fought against multiple opponents and swept away multiple sixth grade Battle-Emperors while killing numerous fifth grade Battle-Kings. He truly was akin to a human-shaped wild beast!\u201cGod damn! Tell me, who\u2019s left!\u201d Ouyang Zongheng said as he stroked his beard. He truly was ferocious!\u201cGood heavens! My obedient daughter, what are you doing inside? It\u2019s dangerous there, so quickly come out!\u201d When Ouyang Zongheng noticed that Ouyang Xiaoyi was inside the store, his heart immediately started quivering. There were two ruthless people inside, if anything happened to her\u2026 He would definitely get it from her mother!\u201cDad!\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s eyes lit up when she saw Ouyang Zongheng and charmingly yelled out.\u201cOh, my obedient daughter,\u201d Ouyang Zongheng replied with a face filled with love, no longer resembling the wild beast that was there a few moments ago.The big pile of soldiers standing behind Ouyang Zongheng were dumbfounded as they looked at their general\u2026 What happened to the dignity of their general?The corner of Xiao Yue\u2019s mouth curled into a smile. Indeed\u2026 Xiao Meng did not dare to directly charge into the store and was afraid of the mysterious store as well.He made the right choice!Hun Qianduan looked at Bu Fang as if he had seen a ghost. The ant-like owner of a store\u2026 actually caused the number one expert of the Light Wind Empire to hesitate? What exactly happened to the world?Like the eunuch, Lian Fu, Hun Qianduan could not understand the situation.\u201cGeneral Xiao, hurry up and capture the fiends from the sects hiding inside the store!\u201d Lian Fu coldly said.\u201cNo way!\u201d\u201cNo way!!\u201dOuyang Zongheng and Xiao Meng replied in unison. Xiao Meng was afraid, while Ouyang Zongheng was purely worried about Ouyang Xiaoyi.\u201cXiaoyi, come over here to dad. Be obedient,\u201d After shouting, Ouyang Zongheng sweetly said toward Ouyang Xiaoyi.Ouyang Xiaoyi glanced at the smelly boss and looked toward her boorish father. She was slightly hesitating as she blinked her adorable eyes.\u201cYou should go over there,\u201d Bu Fang simply said as he patted Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s head.\u201cAlright! Smelly boss, you should be careful,\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi charmingly said as she stood on tiptoes and patted Bu Fang\u2019s shoulder.After she finished, she eagerly ran toward Ouyang Zongheng\u2019s side.\u201cGod damn! Someone! Go in there and arrest those fiends from the sects!\u201d Once Ouyang Xiaoyi was at his side, Ouyang Zongheng\u2019s tenderness immediately turn into malevolence as he put his hands at his waist and angrily ordered while pointing at the store.Xiao Meng\u2019s expression immediately changed.Lian Fu faintly smiled as he pinched his thumb and middle finger together.After receiving the order, five of Ouyang Zongheng\u2019s Battle-King subordinates yelled a battle cry as they charged toward the store. Their objective was to capture Xiao Yue and Hun Qianduan!Xiao Yue\u2019s face was pale, but he had a smile on his face as he looked at the five people approaching.A gigantic figure suddenly appeared at the entrance and its mechanical eyes flashed.The five Battle-Kings were immediately startled. They subconsciously evoked their true energy and aimed for the mechanical puppet blocking their way.With a loud noise, the five Battle-Kings flew backward and crashed into the ground, rolling a few times before they came to a stop.\u201cI already said. You can enter the store, but don\u2019t cause any trouble\u2026\u201d Bu Fang folded his arms across his chest and expressionlessly said, \u201cDo you think my words are nonsense?\u201dAt that moment, the people gathered outside the store sucked in a breath of cold air as they thought, \u201cTo be able to defeat five Battle-Kings in a single move, what the hell is that puppet?! This brat\u2026 What kind of background does he have?!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHun Qianduan\u2019s expression was frozen as well, while Xiao Yue was smiling.Suddenly, Bu Fang turned his head. He looked toward Xiao Yue and indifferently said, \u201cI hate being used by others, so don\u2019t smile\u2026 If I feel like it, I might just throw you out.\u201dThe expression on Xiao Yue\u2019s face immediately froze\u2026[1] \u201cpinching his thumb and index finger together\u201d (\u5170\u82b1\u6307) \u2013 In Chinese culture, eunuchs and homosexuals are often depicted doing this sort of gesture.[2] Gong gong (\u516c\u516c) \u2013 In the past, people address eunuchs as gong gong as a form of respect.

He meaningfully looked at Bu Fang and could feel from Bu Fang\u2019s indifferent gaze that he was not joking.After Bu Fang indifferently glanced at Xiao Yue, he turned back and looked toward the dumbfounded crowd gathered outside the store.Hun Qianduan suppressed the shock within his mind and looked toward Xiao Yue, whose expression was gradually turning sullen. He could not help but narrow his eyes and feel an inexplicable joy from watching the Heart-rending Sword Monarch Xiao Yue admit defeat in front of someone else.\u201cI will admit\u2026 I made an error in judgement, but do you really think that this puppet alone would be able to block both Xiao Meng and Eunuch Lian?\u201d Hun Qiandian twitched his mouth and said after calming down. Xiao Meng and Lian Fu were the two strongest people within the imperial city. How could a mere puppet block the both of them?\u201cDo you really think that I would stay within this store for the rest of my life?\u201d Xiao Yue said as he coldly glanced toward Hun Qianduan and the corner of his mouth curled up.Hun Qianduan\u2019s pupils constricted. As expected of Xiao Yue, he probably already thought of a way to retreat. If the Soul Sect disciple had not spoiled their plans, then the plan might really had perfectly gone the way Xiao Yue had plotted.\u2026\u2026\u201cSo, you have some tricks up your sleeve after all. No wonder you were able to cause General Xiao to hesitate,\u201d Lian Fu sneered as he pinched his thumb and middle finger together. His eyes were curiously sizing up Whitey. \u201cThis puppet is indeed quite powerful to be able to actually defeat five Battle-Kings within one move.\u201dOuyang Zongheng was staring at Whitey as well. He did not think that the things that Xiaoyi said were real. This puppet really was tough and was even much tougher than him.Ouyang Xiaoyi tugged on Ouyang Zongheng\u2019s armor and charmingly said, \u201cDad, let\u2019s not fight with Whitey. Even though the smelly boss is old-fashioned, he\u2019s still not bad.\u201d\u201cOh, my obedient daughter. I\u2019ll listen to you,\u201d Ouyang Zongheng narrowed his eyes and was all smiles as he patted Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s head.\u201cAs if I would go and fight that puppet\u2026 Even five Battle-Kings were defeated by a single move. I am only a sixth grade Battle-Emperor. Even if I went up there, I would only be easily defeated as well. I better leave the puppet to Old Xiao and that damn eunuch. I\u2019d only disgrace myself if I tried.\u201dWhile having such thoughts, the pamperedness on Ouyang Zongheng\u2019s face increased even more as he said, \u201cIf that\u2019s what my daughter wants, then I won\u2019t participate.\u201d\u201cOwner Bu, do you really intend to shelter those criminals from the sects?\u201d Xiao Meng solemnly said in a low voice. If Bu Fang really insisted on sheltering Xiao Yue, then he could only forcibly barge in.\u201cI am not sheltering them. You can come in as well, but fighting is prohibited within the store,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly replied.\u201cOh my, don\u2019t think that you\u2019re invincible just because of that puppet! I really want to see what other tricks you have other than this puppet!\u201d Lian Fu\u2019s high-pitched voice echoed around the alleyway as true energy surged out from his body.\u201cGeneral Xiao, obstruct that puppet while I capture those fiends from the sects!\u201dWith his thumb and middle finger pinched together, the horsetail whisk extended toward his enemies.With unfathomable movement and extremely fast speed, Lian Fu preemptively made a move as he swung his horsetail whisk toward Whitey. The innumerous hair of the horsetail whisk suddenly shot out and became as hard as steel needles under the influence of true energy.Xiao Meng\u2019s expression changed. With no other choice, he could only make a move. His armor collided with a long crash and emitted a sonorous sound.While Xiao Meng obstructed Whitey, Lian Fu\u2019s attack managed to dodge Whitey\u2019s interception. His targets were Xiao Yue and Hun Qianduan, who were hiding within the store.The expression on the faces of both Xiao Yue and Hun Qianduan immediately changed. The worst situation had indeed occurred. Even though Whitey was powerful, it was only a Battle-Saint level puppet. With Xiao Meng obstructing it, the other Battle-Saint, Eunuch Lian, would be free to deal with them.Bu Fang folded his arms across his chest as he indifferently looked toward the rapidly approaching Eunuch Lian. He seemed unconcerned and stood there without doing anything.Xiao Yue\u2019s heart sank. He could not just give up now. He struggled with great difficulty to reach his current level, how could he just let Eunuch Lian catch him! Once he was caught by the imperial court, he would be dead without a doubt.Hun Qianduan\u2019s eyes were filled with despair as well. He was already severely injured, how could he face Eunuch Lian who was in a perfect condition?Was he really going to die there? He could not accept it!Lian Fu\u2019s horsetail whisk had become as sharp as a knife as it propelled toward Xiao Yue. The terrifyingly sharp true energy stirred up the surroundings and seemingly intended to tear everything apart.\u201cI can\u2019t die like this! I can\u2019t die!\u201d Xiao Yue\u2019s eyes suddenly turned bloodshot as his handsome face contorted together.He lastly looked toward Bu Fang, but Bu Fang remained unconcerned.Damn it!\u201cLike I thought, I need to rely on myself for everything!\u201d Xiao Yue thought as he loudly cried out. As he opened his mouth, there seemed to be a bright light blooming within his throat.A boundless sword energy abruptly rose up within the store. The terrifying will of the sword seemed to desire to cut space and penetrate the entire store.Boom!The collision between the life-seizing true energy hidden within Xiao Yue\u2019s mouth and Eunuch Lian\u2019s attack immediately created an astonishing shockwave.Bu Fang knitted his eyebrows together as he felt that a barrier suddenly appeared outside of his body and blocked the torrent of energy.A burst of powerful wind blew away the smoke and dust drifting within the store and revealed the scene within.Taking into account the power of the shockwave between the two, the store would definitely be destroyed. After all, it was a collision between the desperate blow of a Battle-Emperor and the all-out attack of a Battle-Saint. The outcome would be enough to completely level everything within a ten miles radius.The people gathered outside the store swallowed their saliva as they looked at the situation within the store in disbelief.The store was standing there in perfect condition and the collapse and ruin that they imagined did not appear.It was as if the shockwave of their attacks was a breeze blowing.\u201cHmm?! What\u2019s going on?\u201d Lian Fu thought.When Eunuch Lian looked around, his pupils constricted. When he discovered that there was not even a trace of destruction in his surroundings, even his eyelids quivered.Xiao Yue\u2019s entire body was dyed with blood and was practically red from head to toe. He was bitterly laughing but the light in his eyes became brighter and brighter.\u201cI already said\u2026 Creating trouble within the store is prohibited. Did you not understand?\u201d He expressionlessly said as he looked toward Xiao Yue and Lian Fu. The barrier had disappeared and revealed Bu Fang\u2019s immaculate figure.Xiao Meng\u2019s knocked back Whitey with a punch and took a step back. Looking at the situation within the store, a trace of unease suddenly emerged in his heart.The source of unease\u2026 Xiao Meng\u2019s heart skipped a beat when he turned his head and looked toward the big black dog that was always lying at the corner.At that moment\u2026 The big black dog actually stood up!\u201cHmm? Blacky actually stood up?\u201d Bu Fang looked toward Blacky as if he had just discovered a new continent. That lazy dog\u2026 actually moved!Striding elegantly like a cat, Blacky arrived at Eunuch Lian\u2019s feet.Its doggy eyes slightly lifted up as it lazily glanced at the eunuch. Lian Fu was slightly startled as he thought, \u201cWhere did this black dog\u2026 appear from?\u201d\u201cShoo\u2026 Go somewhere else to play! Don\u2019t get too close to me!\u201d Lian Fu disdainfully covered his nose and continuously waved his hand to drive Blacky away. He hated dogs the most!Blacky rolled its eyes and thought, \u201cThis lord dog also hates eunuchs the most!\u201dAfter scornfully glancing at the eunuch, Black strode like a cat to Bu Fang\u2019s side.\u201cHe said not to create trouble within the store\u2026 Did you not understand?\u201dBlacky turned its head and looked toward Xiao Yue and Lian Fu. As it opens its mouth, it actually started speaking like a human.Bu Fang went into a daze then jumped up like he had just seen a ghost as he stared at Blacky.\u201cGood heavens\u2026 This lazy dog actually knows human speech?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBlacky glanced at Bu Fang and could not be bothered to reply to him. It turned its head back to the three of them and the indifferent, masculine voice rang out once more, \u201cI\u2019ll borrow a sentence from that lump of iron\u2026 Troublemakers will be stripped as an example to others.\u201dLian Fu, Xiao Yue, and Hun Qianduan all went into a daze\u2026Then right in front of their eyes, that tame and lazy dog suddenly opened its mouth. That mouth became larger and larger and finally seemed to have turned into the mouth of a wild beast.\u201cBark!\u201dA bark that was like the furious roar of an ancient ominous beast sounded out as an overwhelming hurricane gushed out from the doggy mouth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If they could capture Xiao Yue, it would be a big event that would shock the entire empire! They did not want to miss such a chance to witness this historic moment.Xiao Meng\u2019s eyebrows were knitted together when his expression abruptly changed. True energy instantly gushed out from his entire body and enveloped the surface of his armor.From within the store, a burst of violent wind suddenly gushed out. It was like a rampaging dragon as an intimidating aura surged out and spread with a loud rumble.Ouyang Zongheng, who was stretching his neck out, suddenly froze as his eyes widened and he angrily cursed, \u201cGod damn!\u201dHe turned around and hugged Ouyang Xiaoyi. Boom! The violent wind was like a spiraling dragon as it directly smashed on his back and sent him flying.Fortunately, even though this violent wind was fierce and was also mixed with bad breath\u2026 Ouyang Zongheng did not embarrass himself too much due to his huge body and the fact the force of the wind had weakened.After all, Ouyang Zongheng was a peak-level Battle-Emperor.With a somersault, he landed onto the ground in an elegant manner. Ouyang Zongheng patted the head of Ouyang Xiaoyi and laughed as he said, \u201cMy obedient daughter, isn\u2019t daddy awesome?\u201dOuyang Xiaoyi speechlessly rolled her eyes and snorted.Xiu xiu xu!A loud and clear bark of a dog that sounded like the roar of an ancient ominous beast rang out, and was followed by the whistling sound of a hurricane.Three figures flew out from the store while whirling in the air, accompanied by blood-curdling screams and cries of fear.Even though Xiao Meng\u2019s hair was fluttering in the wind, his body was firmly planted to the ground and unaffected by the violent wind. He was swift as the wind as he reached out his hand and grabbed one of the figures.\u201cHmm?\u201d Xiao Meng was startled as he thought, \u201cWhat\u2019s with this smooth feeling in my hands?\u201d\u201cOh my! How annoying, General Xiao! Let me down!\u201d A high-pitched voice filled with resentment and a little shyness rang out.Xiao Meng expressionlessly looked at the person in his hands, who was wearing nothing but an underwear\u2026 the Chief Eunuch Lian Fu.\u201cCough\u2026 Your skin isn\u2019t bad,\u201d Xiao Meng calmly said as he lightly coughed and lay down Lian Fu.Lian Fu resentfully rolled his eyes at Xiao Meng. When he looked toward the store, his eyes were filled with shame and anger. That dog\u2026 was definitely not a normal breed of dog!Boom boom!!Xiao Yue and Hun Qianduan ruthlessly slammed into the wall and fell onto the ground. Both of their clothes were torn into pieces in the violent wind and revealed their naked bodies with only a loincloth left on their bodies.\u201cXiao Yue!\u201d Xiao Meng instantly noticed Xiao Yue who was thrown out and an overwhelming killing intent immediately burst forth from his eyes. As he ferociously stomped the ground, the tiles underneath him collapsed and broke into pieces, and he charged toward Xiao Yue with a single step.Xiao Yue was bleeding all over his body as he unsteadily stood up from the ground. There was a strange smile on his face.\u201cXiao Meng\u2026 You can\u2019t keep me here. You couldn\u2019t do it yesterday, you won\u2019t be able to do it today as well!\u201dAs he finished speaking, a few sword cries that sounded like dragons came from above as four figures suddenly descended and landed in front of Xiao Yue.As the four figures and three swords suspended in the air appeared, a powerful and intimidating aura suddenly exploded.\u201cVoid Sword Pavilion! Nine Stars Temple!\u201dXiao Meng\u2019s pupils constricted but his movements did not stop. His fist flew out with an unmatchable might and the true energy was practically tearing up the air.The three swordsman waved their fingers like swords and the three flying swords immediately formed a sword formation to block the attack.The remaining taoist priest formed several hand seals as he gathered true energy into his hand and threw his fist toward Xiao Meng as well. The three of them collided in the air and created an astonishing shockwave.Chi chi!Each of the four men blocking in front of Xiao Yue spat out a mouthful of blood as they took a step back. They grabbed hold of Xiao Yue and Hun Qianduan, and escaped by flying away.Xiao Meng\u2019s figure trembled and his entire body convulsed before he was able to dissipate the energy that was twined around his body. However, within that short period of time, Xiao Yue was already taken away.\u201cDamn it\u2026 I knew Xiao Yue had a backup plan!\u201d Xiao Meng was unable to accept it as he silently cursed. He smashed his fist into the wall out of frustration and innumerous cracks immediately appeared.\u201cIt\u2019s all because of this big black dog! Xiao Yue was already surrounded by us\u2026 and his capture was nigh! Why did you blow him out!\u201d Lian Fu was exasperated as he turned around and gestured toward the interior of the store with his thumb and middle finger pinched together.\u201cAre you pointing at me with your fingers?\u201d A dog strode out of the store like a cat and stood at the entrance as it arrogantly looked toward Lian Fu.\u201cI am talking about you! Don\u2019t think that I would be afraid of you just because your surprise attack succeeded!\u201d Lian Fu said as he rocked and swinged his slim waist.Blacky\u2019s doggy mouth slightly widened into a meaningful smile\u2026Then, Lian Fu felt a surge of intimidating aura poured down from above the nine heavens and instantly pressed down on him. It was like he was being pressed down by a majestic mountain as he lay on his stomach and could not move.Lian Fu went into a daze as his white hair dangled in front of him and completely covered his face\u2026 How embarrassing.Xiao Meng\u2019s pupils constricted as he thought, \u201cThis intimidating aura\u2026 This big black dog is actually\u2026 a ninth grade supreme beast!\u201d\u201cOwner Bu\u2026 This time, it\u2019s our fault for offending you. Could you let this\u2026 lord dog back off?\u201d Xiao Meng said toward the store as he executed a fist and palm salute.Bu Fang walked out from the store. His lean figure and tied up long hair made him appear neat and tidy.\u201cThis lazy dog, Blacky, has a bad temper\u2026 I will take this time as a lesson to the eunuch. Remember, next time when you\u2019re here\u2026 Make sure to follow the rules,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly said.After he finished speaking, Bu Fang stroked Blacky\u2019s smooth and immaculate fur, and indifferently said, \u201cStop fooling around and release that eunuch.\u201dBlacky turned its head and said, \u201cWhat if I said no?\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll wake up later tomorrow and skip cooking practice\u2026\u201d Bu Fang remained expressionless as he seriously said.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll let him go.\u201d Blacky snorted as it rolled his eyes at Bu Fang. It strode like a cat toward the corner of the wall and went to sleep at a comfortable spot.The corner of Bu Fang\u2019s mouth slightly widened as he thought, \u201cSo, the final line of defence mentioned by the system was this freeloading dog. No wonder\u2026 With the system\u2019s miserly personality, there\u2019s no way that the system would be raising a big black dog that was ready to evolve into a pig.\u201d\u201cOh, my waist!\u201d When Lian Fu felt that the intimidating aura pressing down on him had disappeared, he hurriedly got up from the ground and fearfully looked toward Blacky. He did not dare to say anything else and ran away with his tail between his legs while only wearing a loincloth.\u201cBlacky is awesome!\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi happily clapped her hands as her eyes narrowed into a crescent shape. \u201cHe\u2019s so much stronger than dad.\u201dGeneral Ouyang Zongheng felt as if an invisible arrow had pierced into his chest\u2026 In the eyes of his obedient daughter, he was already incomparable to a dog.\u201cThank you, Owner Bu,\u201d Xiao Meng solemnly thanked Bu Fang. Then he meaningfully looked toward Blacky who was soundly asleep and left.Xiao Meng needed to report to the emperor that the plan to capture Xiao Yue and Hun Qianduan had failed.Immediately, the experts within the alleyway quickly disappeared like a receding tide. Ouyang Xiaoyi was taken away by Ouyang Zongheng as well. While she was leaving, she even happily waved toward Bu Fang.Once everyone had left, Bu Fang glanced toward Blacky, who was soundly asleep. He then entered the store and closed up the entrance.\u2026\u201cYour Majesty, you must seek justice for me! That unscrupulous store is really impudent and has no respect for the law! They actually dare to shelter criminals from the sects! When I tried to intervene\u2026 They even tore off my clothes!\u201d Lian Fu grievously complained to Ji Changfeng, who was sitting on the dragon throne. His entire face was filled with tears.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe emperor only chuckled as he placated Lian Fu. His gaze shifted toward Xiao Meng who was standing upright within the large hall.\u201cGeneral Xiao\u2026 Is the store really as magical as you said? There\u2019s a ninth grade supreme beast guarding the place?\u201d\u201cYour humble servant\u2019s words are all true,\u201d Xiao Meng solemnly said.The emperor\u2019s eyes narrowed as he stroked his white beard and faintly smiled. \u201cI heard that the dishes within the store are delicious\u2026 That there\u2019s even a rumor of a wine that\u2019s better than the Bejewelled Nectar Wine?\u201cI\u2026 am really quite curious.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The autumn wind was beginning to change into a bone-chilling cold wind. Bu Fang woke up early in the morning. It was so cold that he did not want to leave his bed.After washing up, Bu Fang wrapped himself in a thick coat and opened up the store. As the cold wind blew into the store, he felt a chill along his back as the cold air burrowed down his neck.Bu Fang rubbed his hands together and lightly sucked in a breath of cold air.Glancing at Blacky who was lying on the ground, Bu Fang pursed his lips and thought, \u201cThis lazy dog\u2026 It only knows how to sleep all day. Why doesn\u2019t it have the sort of awareness a supreme beast should have? Shouldn\u2019t it be standing in a majestic manner at the entrance to improve the classiness of the store?\u201d\u201cBrat, this lord dog wants to eat Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs,\u201d Blacky opened its eyes and lazily said to Bu Fang. Its voice was not considered old, but was masculine and filled with magnetism instead.Bu Fang raised his eyebrows. \u201cYou lazy dog, you\u2019ve only been freeloading here and now, you\u2019re even ordering dishes?\u201dBlacky rolled his eyes and ignored Bu Fang. It buried its head in its paws and went back to sleep. Its meaning was obvious, whether he cooked the dish was up to him.Bu Fang was furious\u2026 How dare the lazy dog ignore him! Was it not afraid that he would add a large spoonful of Abyssal Chilli Sauce into the Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs? It would make that lazy dog wish for death.Bu Fang turned around and returned to the kitchen. Even though he said he did not want to cook the Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs, Blacky helped out yesterday after all. So, Bu Fang reluctantly decided to agree to its request for once.He took out some of the main ingredients needed to cook the Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs from the freezer: the prime ribs of the Flying Cloud Boar, some starch, and the sauce used for seasoning.Bu Fang placed the prime ribs onto the chopping board. As he waved his hand, a kitchen knife glimmering with sharpness began to twirl in his hand. After twirling the knife in his hands a few times, Bu Fang rapidly smacked the prime ribs with the back of the kitchen knife.The meat was easier to chop once he loosened the meat by smacking it. After practicing the Meteor Cutting Technique for so many days, Bu Fang\u2019s skills had improved by quite a margin. As the kitchen knife firmly chopped into the prime ribs, only an afterimage could be seen.When Bu Fang first tried cooking the Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs, he felt that chopping the meat was extremely tiring. However, since his cutting technique had improved, it was much easier to chop it.Once he chopped the prime ribs, that were filled with spirit energy, into pieces, he placed them into the starch paste that had just been prepared and ensured that each piece was coated.Filling half of the wok with oil, he waited until the hot air rising up was hot enough to scald his hand and placed each piece of meat into the wok.Pssst!As the pieces of meat rolled within the oil, a fragrance was drifting out.Once all of the pieces of meat were deep fried, Bu Fang placed them into a large bowl. The tangerine sweet and sour sauce was mixed together with the meat and finally placed onto a plate.\u201cBlacky, it\u2019s time to eat,\u201d Bu Fang walked out of the kitchen with the plate of Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs and lightly called out.Blacky\u2019s half-opened eyes immediately lit up as its doggy nose sniffed the air. Its tongue was hanging out of its mouth as it eagerly looked at the plate of Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs in Bu Fang\u2019s hands.As he placed the plate of Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs in front of Blacky, it began to gobble down the food in the plate while wagging its tail.The corner of Bu Fang\u2019s mouth widened into a smile as he stroked Black\u2019s smooth and immaculate fur. He stood up and pulled a chair toward the entrance. As he sat down, he began to leisurely bask himself in the sun.Even though a large battle between the top experts of the imperial city happened yesterday within the store, there was not much of a change to Bu Fang\u2019s daily life.The rays of the late autumn sun were even warmer and more comfortable and his clothing was exuding an intoxicating light fragrance under the sun\u2019s rays.What a wonderful day.From a distance, Fatty Jin and his buddies were majestically approaching. Fatty Jin who was leading the group was limping and his pudgy face was even slightly swollen.\u201cGood morning, Owner Bu. You\u2019re sunbathing? What a leisure mood you\u2019re in,\u201d Fatty Jin greeted Bu Fang.Bu Fang nodded and puzzledly stared at him as he said, \u201cWhy\u2019s your face swollen? You\u2019re already very fat, there\u2019s no need to make it swell up even more.[1]\u201d\u201cOwner Bu\u2026 Can\u2019t we have a proper chat? Isn\u2019t this all because of you?\u201d The moment the wounds on his face were mentioned, Fatty Jin\u2019s eyes were filled with resentment.\u201cYour Oyster Pancakes were too fragrant\u2026\u201d He recounted everything that had happened at the execution grounds to Bu Fang, causing the latter to be slightly stunned\u2026So, the debut of the Oyster Pancake created such a stir.\u201cYou did such an inhumane act, why didn\u2019t he just beat you to death\u2026\u201d Bu Fang simply said as he stood up and stretched his body. Then he walked toward the kitchen.Fatty Jin did not know whether to laugh or cry. He did not expect Owner Bu to mock him. \u201cOwner Bu, I\u2019ll have the same as usual.\u201dBu Fang waved his hand to indicate that he heard. After a while, a rich fragrance drifted out from the kitchen.Ouyang Xiaoyi was skipping as she arrived. Her mood that day was pretty good.\u201cOh my, Fatty Jin. What are you trying to pretend to be by making your face swell up like that?[1]\u201d The first thing Ouyang Xiaoyi noticed when she entered the store was Fatty Jin\u2019s wretched appearance and she immediately laughed out loud.Fatty Jin could only bitterly smile. Under Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s constant pestering, he recounted the story about the Oyster Pancake once more.\u201cIs the Oyster Pancake really that delicious? Then, I\u2019ll have to make the smelly boss make a serving for me. I\u2019ll bring it back to let mom, dad and grandpa have a taste,\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi thought.\u201cXiao Yi, serve the dish,\u201d Bu Fang lightly shouted. He knew that Xiaoyi had arrived when he heard her laughter coming from the dining area.\u201cOh!\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi eagerly ran toward the kitchen window and served the dishes to Fatty Jin and his buddies.Fatty Jin and his buddies satisfactorily finished their food and left after paying their bills. Naturally, each of them was carrying Oyster Pancakes when they left.Ji Chengxue was wearing a white robe as he elegantly arrived. He was practically a regular customer of the store and a gentle smile could often be seen on his face\u201cYour Highness big brother, what do you want to eat?\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi asked.\u201cI\u2019ll have a serving of Lees Fish and a jar of Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine.\u201d Ji Chengxue chuckled.After a while, the dishes were served. Ji Chengxue contentedly poured and drank the Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine by himself as he ate the Lees Fish.At the entrance of the alleyway, a slim figure with white hair was approaching while swaying his hips.\u201cMy gosh, I almost got a heart attack. Why is this dog still staying here! You\u2019re still a supreme beast after all, could you at least display the domineering aura of a supreme beast?\u201dLian Fu had fair and clear skin and was wearing casual clothes with his white hair rolled up and bound by a bronze headdress. When he saw Blacky, his heart quivered as he pinched his thumb and middle finger together and said.Blacky could not be bothered to care about the damn eunuch. It was slowly gnawing on the Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs with a contented expression as a fragrance drifted everywhere.\u201cHmm, it\u2019s\u2026 quite fragrant,\u201d Lian Fu muttered as he gestured while pinching his thumb and middle finger together.Blacky\u2019s body froze as it alertly glanced at the damn eunuch. Then, it shifted its body so that its buttocks was facing Lian Fu before it continued to gnaw on its Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs.Who would want that! Lian was exasperated. As if he, the Chief Eunuch, would fight over dog food.Hmph! Lian Fu proudly snorted as he stepped into Bu Fang\u2019s store while swaying his hips. He was not there to create trouble or to capture anyone. He was purely there to buy food.His Majesty had given him an imperial edict the day before to bring back all the dishes in the store to let him have a taste. If the taste was alright, he would even entice Bu Fang into joining the imperial palace.\u201cHe\u2019s just a little cook from a store located inside an alleyway. Are his skills really comparable to the imperial chefs?\u201d However, Lian Fu was not particularly keen about his mission that day.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cOh my, Your Highness! Why are you here? Oh my, isn\u2019t this our General Ouyang\u2019s young lady?\u201d The moment he stepped into the store, Lian Fu\u2019s eyes immediately lit up when he saw Ji Chengxue who was eating and drinking, and the adorable Ouyang Xiaoyi who was nearby.\u201cHmm? Lian gong gong, why\u2026 are you here today?\u201d Ji Chengxue was slightly surprised. Lian Fu was his father\u2019s personal eunuch. It was truly strange that he would appear within the store\u2026\u201cThere\u2019s something Your Highness is unaware. His Majesty ordered me to bring back all of the dishes to the palace. Isn\u2019t that why I am here? I can\u2019t disobey my orders.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 Eh? Takeout?\u201d Ji Chengxue nodded but soon his expression became strange as he looked toward Lian Fu.[1] To beat up one\u2019s own face to pretend to be fat (\u6253\u80bf\u8138\u5145\u80d6\u5b50) \u2013 When someone does something beyond their own abilities to impress others.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There was a trace of humor in his eyes.\u201cThat\u2019s right, His Majesty said he wanted to eat the food from this place. That\u2019s why I hurried over here, although I personally don\u2019t think there would be any delicious dishes in this store. Don\u2019t tell me that it would be better than the food from the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant and the imperial kitchen?\u201d Lian Fu unconcernedly said as he pinched his thumb and middle finger together and played with the bangs hanging in front of his forehead.At that moment, Ji Chengxue had already finished his food. He calmly stood up and solemnly said to Lian Fu, \u201cNo, gong gong, what you\u2019re saying is incorrect. Owner Bu\u2019s culinary skills is definitely the best. His culinary skills deserve his asking price.\u201dLian Fu was slightly startled as he thought, \u201cTo think that the third prince would think so highly of this store. It looks like this store might have some capabilities after all.\u201d\u201cI hope that\u2019s the case. By the way, didn\u2019t His Majesty appoint Your Highness in the military campaign against the sects? When is Your Highness going to set off?\u201d Lian Fu suddenly seemed to remember something as he asked Ji Chengxue.\u201cThere\u2019s still a few more days,\u201d Ji Chengxue seemed to be uninterested in the question as he lightly sighed and stopped the conversation. After paying the bill, he was carrying a serving of Oyster Pancakes as takeout while leaving the store.\u201cGong gong, what do you want to eat?\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi charmingly asked Lian Fu.Lian Fu walked toward a seat while swaying his hips and sat down. He crossed his leg over the other and asked with a smile, \u201cWhat\u2019s\u2026 delicious here?\u201d\u201cGonggong, look behind you. The menu is on the wall,\u201d Ouyang Xiao pointed to the wall behind Lian Fu and seriously said.Lian Fu was slightly surprised for a moment. When he turned his head, he immediately saw the menu and the astronomical price of the dishes.\u201cOh my! As expected of the rumored black-hearted store that is known throughout the imperial city. A plate of Egg-Fried Rice actually costs ten crystals, it\u2019s even faster than snatching money.\u201d Lian Fu raised his eyebrows and there was a trace of ridicule in his high-pitched voice.Bu Fang walked out of the kitchen and wiped off the water droplets on his hands. He expressionlessly glanced toward Lian Fu.\u201cThe price is clearly indicated and our customers are treated fairly. It\u2019s up to you whether you want to eat or not,\u201d Bu Fang simply said.\u201cHeh! You\u2019re really bad tempered even though you\u2019re not strong at all. Do you really think I am bothered by the price? I have nothing but money! I\u2019ve more than enough money to buy ten of your stores!\u201d Lian Fu snorted and said.\u201cNo, your money can\u2019t purchase the store,\u201d Bu Fang seriously replied.\u201cI don\u2019t want to argue with a country bumpkin like you. Do you know how much assets I have? It\u2019s enough to crush you to death if I stacked them into gold coins!\u201d Lian Fu pinched his thumb and middle finger, and played with his fingernails as he scornfully glanced at Bu Fang.\u201cI don\u2019t want to say any more, just serve the dishes first. I want to try out each dish. If I find them delicious, pack a serving of each dish for me.\u201d\u201cOur store doesn\u2019t provide takeout service. There\u2019s only one dish that permits takeout,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly replied.Lian Fu was slightly stunned as he carefully observed Bu Fang. When he discovered the solemn expression on Bu Fang\u2019s face and realized he was not bluffing, he was immediately furious.\u201cIf I am telling you to pack the food, you should just pack the food. What\u2019s with all this nonsense?\u201d Lian Fu uncrossed his legs. He pointed toward Bu Fang with one hand while placing the other hand on his waist as he snorted and said.\u201cHmm? Are you trying to cause trouble?\u201d Bu Fang frowned and simply said.Lian Fu\u2019s body immediately froze as he sneaked a peek at Blacky, who was lying at the entrance and still gnawing on the Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs, from the corner of his eye. When he recalled the terrifying moment when that black dog blew away his clothes with a single breath, his entire body shuddered.\u201cI am not trying to cause trouble. Just serve the dishes and let me have a taste first.\u201d Lian Fu twitched his mouth and finally yielded.\u201cWhat do you want to eat?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I already said it? I\u2019ll have all the dishes,\u201d Lian Fu impatiently replied.Bu Fang expressionlessly looked at him and asked, \u201cAre you sure?\u201dWhen Lian Fu did not reply any further, Bu Fang nodded and returned to the kitchen.After a while, the rich fragrance of the Egg-Fried Rice drifted out into the dining area.\u201cThe first dish, Ordinary Egg-Fried Rice. Xiaoyi, serve the dish,\u201d Bu Fang\u2019s indifferent voice rang out from the kitchen.Xiaoyi eagerly ran toward the window and brought the overwhelmingly fragrant Egg-Fried Rice to Lian Fu. She placed the plate of Egg-Fried Rice onto the table and charmingly said, \u201cHere\u2019s your Egg-Fried Rice. Please enjoy your meal.\u201dLian Fu nodded. As his gaze shifted toward the Egg-Fried Rice, his eyes immediately lit up and found the sight in front of him slightly incredible. The plate of Egg-Fried Rice in front of him seemed to be slightly giving off light.Using a porcelain spoon to scoop up a spoonful of rice, the golden egg fluid left a string-like trail as he lifted it up. An even richer fragrance surged out from within the Egg-Fried Rice and assaulted Lian Fu\u2019s nasal cavities. He could not help but take a deep breath.\u201cHow fragrant! Looks like he has some skills after all,\u201d Lian Fu muttered. As he shoved the spoonful of Egg-Fried Rice into his mouth, the delicious taste immediately burst forth. The supple and smooth egg fluid instantly solidified inside his mouth and became springy as it smacked his taste buds. He was completely captivated by the food.\u201cDe\u2026 Delicious!\u201d After eating a mouthful, Lian Fu could not stop any longer. He continued to shove spoon after spoon of Egg-Fried Rice into his mouth.When Ouyang Xiao saw Lian Fu\u2019s appearance, she covered her mouth and laughed as she said, \u201cGong gong, take your time. No one is going to snatch your food, there\u2019s still more dishes later.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 De\u2026 Delicious!\u201d Lian Fu continuously nodded his head as he replied. A grain of golden rice fell out and landed onto the table. Lian Fu\u2019s eyes immediately widened as he hurriedly picked the rice grain up and shoved it into his mouth.\u201cThe second dish, Improved Egg-Fried Rice. Xiaoyi, serve the dish,\u201d Bu Fang\u2019s voice rang out once more. Another dish was completed once again.When Lian Fu took a bite of the Improved Egg-Fried Rice, his expression changed. He could not believe the dense amount of spirit energy circulating within the Egg-Fried Rice. It was practically more effective than eating an elixir!\u201cThe third dish, Dry-Mixed Noodles and Stir-Fried Vegetables.\u201d\u201cThe fourth dish, Fish Head Tofu Soup. Xiaoyi, serve the dish.\u201d\u2026\u201cThe eighth dish, Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs. Xiaoyi, serve the dish,\u201d Bu Fang\u2019s voice rang out once more and Ouyang Xiaoyi cheerfully ran over to pick up the dish.\u201cBurp! Why is there still more dishes\u2026 How fragrant\u2026 Burp!\u201d Lian Fu\u2019s stomach was filled to the point of bursting but his mouth could not stop at all. He had just swallowed the overwhelmingly fragrant Golden Shumai when the Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs that was exuding a rich aroma was served.The tangerine color of the Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs was extremely appetizing. Even though Lian Fu had already eaten a lot of dishes, he could not help but reach out his chopsticks when he smelled the aroma.As a piece of Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs entered his mouth, the intoxicating taste of the sauce spread within it and instantly captivated Lian Fu within the rich taste of the meat.\u201cHmm, it\u2019s so delicious!\u201d Lian Fu uncontrollably muttered as he gestured with his thumb and middle finger pinched together.\u201cGonggong, do you still feel that the smelly boss\u2019 dishes are incomparable to the food from Immortal Phoenix Restaurant?\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi calmly asked as she proudly looked at the Chief Eunuch Lian Fu, who was completely captivated by the delicious food.Lian Fu had just finished the Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs and was using a handkerchief to lightly dab his lips while occasionally burping.\u201cI\u2019ll admit\u2026 Burp! The food here indeed tastes delicious and deserves the price. In addition, these dishes contain a dense amount of spirit energy that would help in cultivating. The price is considered fair as well,\u201d Lian Fu nodded and said as he smacked his lips.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIt\u2019s really good. I didn\u2019t expect a little cook like you would actually have such culinary skills. It\u2019s my oversight.\u201d Lian Fu gave a heartfelt praise as he glanced at Bu Fang, who had just walked out of the kitchen, with awe.Naturally, Bu Fang would gladly accept when someone praised his culinary skills. He nodded as a form of acknowledgement.\u201cVery well, little cook, pack a serving of each dish for me,\u201d Lian Fu said as he rubbed the jade pendant hanging at his waist with his palm. Suddenly, a lot of crystals appeared.\u201cThe rules of the store only permit each customer to order each dish only once and takeouts are not available. Oh, there\u2019s one dish that is permitted for takeouts\u2026 the Oyster Pancake.\u201dBu Fang looked toward the crystals on the table and expressionlessly said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This is your greatest honor!\u201dBu Fang was frowning as he looked toward the haughty Lian Fu in displeasure. He had already clearly stated that the store did not provide takeout service. Why was the eunuch unable to understand?\u201cTell me, how much money do I need to pay before I can order takeout? Just say the price,\u201d Lian Fu snorted and said, while pinching his thumb and middle finger together. He was exasperated by Bu Fang\u2019s unwavering attitude as well.\u201cDo you still not understand what I am saying?\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly glanced at him. He did not feel like paying any further attention to the eunuch anymore. He returned to the kitchen and came back with the last dish.The golden Oyster Pancakes were wrapped in large bamboo leaves that concealed its aroma.\u201cThis is the last dish, the Oyster Pancake. This is permitted for takeout. You can bring this back and let the emperor eat this,\u201d Bu Fang passed the Oyster Pancake to Lian Fu and simply said.Lian Fu went into a daze as he subconsciously received the Oyster Pancakes. He glanced at the Oyster Pancake wrapped in bamboo leaves. Even though the smell was fragrant\u2026 compared to the sumptuous Fish Head Tofu Soup, the Oyster Pancake seemed a little shabby.He ate so many delicious dishes and only brought a serving of this shabby Oyster Pancake back\u2026 Would His Majesty scold him when he returned?\u201cLittle cook\u2026 can\u2019t you make an exception for me? Not even if I fork out a hundred crystals?\u201d Lian Fu bit his lips as he resentfully looked at Bu Fang.Bu Fang\u2019s entire body shuddered. Lian Fu\u2019s gaze was causing goosebumps to appear all over his body. Bu Fang ducked his head and turned around. He immediately returned to the kitchen and completely ignored the Chief Eunuch Lian Fu.Lian Fu watched as Bu Fang left. He sighed as he gloomily looked at the Oyster Pancake in his hands. Finally, he could only grudgingly leave.After seeing off Lian Fu, Ouyang Xiaoyi excitedly ran toward Bu Fang.\u201cSmelly boss, give me a serving of Oyster Pancake!\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi charmingly shouted.\u201cHmm? Are you going to eat it now?\u201d Bu Fang was startled as he puzzledly asked. Didn\u2019t Xiaoyi mention that she wanted to bring it back with her so that she could let her parents have a taste?Ouyang Xiaoyi swallowed her saliva and said with a grin, \u201cI can\u2019t bear it any longer. I\u2019ll have a taste for them first.\u201dEven though Bu Fang knew that she was feeling gluttonous, he did not expose her and only told her to wait.After a while, two servings of Oyster Pancakes were ready to be eaten.He handed one serving to Xiaoyi and took the other serving for himself. The two of them comfortably pulled a chair to the entrance and ate the Oyster Pancakes.Tearing off the bamboo leaves, Ouyang Xiaoyi impatiently took a bite of the Oyster Pancake. A crisp sound rang out. As she bit down on the crispy crust of the Oyster Pancake, the juice of the radishes flowed into her mouth.A rich fragrance was exuding from the Oyster Pancakes and had enveloped her surroundings. She had an enraptured expression on her face as she continued to eat the Oyster Pancake with her head lowered.The two of them were curled up on the chairs as they ate the Oyster Pancakes. The fragrance was slowly spreading and was lingering within the alleyway,\u2026\u201cYour Majesty, this is the food your humble servant brought back from the black-hearted store, the Oyster Pancake.\u201d Lian Fu was carrying a silver plate with numerous exquisite patterns carved on its surface.Two hemispherical golden Oyster Pancakes were placed on the silver plate and were still exuding a slight warmth as a faint aroma hovered above it.The Emperor Ji Changfeng stroked his beard as he puzzledly looked at Lian Fu and asked, \u201cXiao Fu, didn\u2019t I tell you to bring back all of the dishes? Why did you only bring back such a tiny thing?\u201dThe appearance of the Oyster Pancake was indeed terrible. It looked like a type of food that commoners would eat.When Lian Fu heard the emperor\u2019s words, his heart trembled and he immediately complained with a long face, \u201cYour Majesty, there\u2019s something you don\u2019t know. The owner of that black-hearted store said that all the other dishes are not permitted for takeouts. Only this Oyster Pancake is allowed for takeouts.\u201d\u201cOh? Then you\u2019ve tasted the other dishes?\u201d Ji Changfeng indifferently asked as he gave Lian Fu a sidelong glance.\u201cHmm, the taste was excellent, especially that Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs\u2026\u201d Lian Fu was about to describe Bu Fang\u2019s dishes when he felt the emperor\u2019s incomprehensible gaze. His heart suddenly trembled as he took a step back and bowed, \u201cUh, Your Majesty, it\u2019s my mistake!\u201d\u201cLooks like the culinary skills of that store\u2019s owner should be pretty good. Otherwise, you wouldn\u2019t be praising him so highly. Then, I\u2019ll give this\u2026 Oyster Pancake a taste,\u201d Ji Changfeng said.Lian Fu was immediately overjoyed that the emperor did not blame him and hurriedly straightened his back. He offered up the silver plate to Ji Changfeng and took out a small silver dagger which he used to slice one of the Oyster Pancakes in half after pulling back his baggy sleeves.A rich fragrance was instantly released as the Oyster Pancake, that previously had a weaker aroma, was sliced open. It was like an aromatic bomb was stepped on.A white juice seeped out from the opening and covered half of the plate.Ji Changfeng\u2019s eyes immediately lit up as he smelled the Oyster Pancake\u2019s aroma. He exclaimed in surprise, \u201cThe smell is fragrant but not pungent, it\u2019s mellow but lingers in the air. Good!\u201dLian Fu was extremely surprised as well. He did not think that the unassuming Oyster Pancake would be so fragrant. With such a rich fragrance, the taste should be quite good as well.Ji Changfeng reached out his hand and picked up one of the Oyster Pancake that was sliced open. He looked at the plump Oyster Pancake and promptly took a bite. The flavor of the oyster was unreservedly released in his mouth. It instantly rushed into his nasal cavities and caused all of the pores on his body to widen.The crispy crust that was perfectly deep fried combined with the tenderness of the shredded radish created an unprecedented texture. Ji Chengfeng could only give praise.\u201cDelicious! What an excellent Oyster Pancake!\u201dLian Fu swallowed his saliva and was joyous as well. He thought, \u201cYour Majesty, I am just glad that you\u2019re happy. I am only afraid that I would be in trouble if you weren\u2019t\u2026\u201dAfter that half of the Oyster Pancake was eaten, Ji Changfeng could not help but lick his lips as he wiped off the oil stains on his beard. He picked up the other half of the Oyster Pancake and finished it within a short while.After eating both Oyster Pancakes, Ji Changfeng happily breathed out with a satisfied expression.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve had such a comfortable meal. This black-hearted store has some ability after all. I am suddenly curious about the other dishes.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty, that store doesn\u2019t permit takeout\u2026 Your Majesty would need to personally visit the store in order to eat the other dishes.\u201d Lian Fu was feeling slightly indignant.\u201cSo what if I have to personally visit? With such delicious dishes, it\u2019s worth it for me to personally go there. Besides, isn\u2019t there a wine better than the Bejewelled Nectar Wine in that store? I\u2019ve always yearned for good wine. Xiao Fu, go and make preparations. I\u2019ll personally go there tomorrow.\u201d\u201cOh my, Your Majesty?! There\u2019s no need for Your Majesty to personally visit such a store. Your humble servant will go back tomorrow and make sure to bring all the dishes back.\u201d Lian Fu was feeling slightly anxious. With the emperor\u2019s condition, how could he let him personally go there?Ji Changfeng indifferently glanced at Lian Fu and said, \u201cXiao Fu, if I could visit Immortal Phoenix Restaurant for the sake of a Roasted Flower Duck, why can\u2019t I enter this store for delicious food? Remember, we\u2019re going incognito, tomorrow.\u201dLian Fu felt helpless. He made up his mind to secretly arrange for the imperial physicians to be at the ready, aside from other arrangements. He would still be able to react, in case something happened.At the same moment, in Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store, Ouyang Xiaoyi was looking at Bu Fang in a pitiful manner after finishing the two Oyster Pancakes.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cSmelly boss, just give Xiaoyi another serving. Xiaoyi isn\u2019t satisfied yet.\u201dHer large eyes were blinking in a lovely, touching manner that would give anyone a strong urge to protect her.Bu Fang glanced at her and simply said, \u201cNo, if you eat too much Oyster Pancakes\u2026 you\u2019ll accumulate internal heat[1].\u201d\u2014[1] accumulate internal heat \u2013 In Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM), food is categorized into heaty, neutral, and cooling and it is believed that illnesses are caused by consuming an imbalance diet. When someone is suffering from certain ailments(e.g. Having a sore throat.) defined as \u201cheaty\u201d, they would consume \u201ccooling\u201d food to offset that imbalance.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was looking at the system panel while washing up.After looking at the true energy conversion degree, he realized that he should be able to reach the next level soon. He was currently a third grade Battle-Maniac. Once he reached a thousand crystals, his true energy value would reach fourth grade Battle-Spirit. At that time, he would become much more proficient at controlling true energy\u201cWhat exactly is the set\u2026 I am really curious. However, I\u2019ve already collected three fragments. Once I reach the next level, I should be able to complete the collection,\u201d Bu Fang muttered as he headed downstairs.Then he arrived at the kitchen and began his daily radish slicing practice.After finishing his practice, Bu Fang walked toward the store\u2019s entrance and removed the door boards. The air seemed to have gotten colder and even the cold wind blowing on his face was slightly bone-chilling.Bu Fang glanced at Blacky, who was still soundly asleep, and returned to the kitchen to practice his cooking. After a while, an overwhelmingly fragrant Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs was completed.\u201cIt\u2019s time to eat, Blacky.\u201d As Bu Fang placed the Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs in front of Blacky, it immediately became energetic.Fatty Jin and his buddies arrived as usual and left after finishing breakfast. Eating at Bu Fang\u2019s place had already become a habit for them. Even though Bu Fang\u2019s dishes were expensive, Fatty Jin was a nouveau riche\u2026 He did not lack money.Xiao Yue did not appear anymore after he was blown out of the store by Blacky\u2019s sneeze, as if he had completely disappeared from within the imperial city. However, Bu Fang did not mind at all. At the most, he felt regret over the loss of a customer.Within the alleyway, a slightly bone-chilling autumn wind was blowing. Ji Chengxue, who was wearing a white robe, slowly approached the store. His fair and gentle face and his narrowed eyes made it seem as if he was constantly smiling.\u201cOwner Bu, good morning,\u201d Ji Chengxue gently greeted Bu Fang. Bu Fang indifferently nodded and acknowledged the greeting.\u201cYour Highness big brother, why are you so early today?\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi puzzledly asked Ji Chengxue, who had just stepped into the store and sat down.Ji Chengxue patted Xiaoyi\u2019s head and said with a chuckle, \u201cI am here to eat Owner Bu\u2019s dishes today.\u201d\u201cWhat are you eating today?\u201d Bu Fang asked.\u201cI\u2019ll have a serving of each dish. After this time, I don\u2019t know whether I would have the chance to taste Owner Bu\u2019s dishes anymore,\u201d Ji Chengxue said with a sigh.\u201cHmm? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Bu Fang puzzledly asked. Ouyang Xiaoyi was curiously looking at Ji Chengxue as well.Ji Chengxue\u2019s gaze was slightly downcast as he simply said, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s just family matters. I\u2019ll be leaving the imperial city tomorrow. As for when I am returning, I have no idea either.\u201d\u201cI understand, give me a moment.\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly nodded and went back into the kitchen. Then he returned with a jar of Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine and directly tossed it toward Ji Chengxue.Ji Chengxue was startled as he caught the jar of wine. Then with a gentle smile, he removed the cloth cover and poured the wine into a cup.Bu Fang poured a cup for himself as well. He lifted up his wine cup and they lightly clinked their cups together as he said, \u201cI wish you safe journey.\u201d\u201cHahaha, thank you. How about treating me to a meal today? Or give me a discount?\u201d Ji Chengxue finished the cup of wine in one gulp and started to chuckle.Bu Fang indifferently glanced at him and expressionlessly replied, \u201cNo.\u201dThen Bu Fang returned to the kitchen and began to cook the other dishes.Footsteps could be heard from the alleyway once more and three figures slowly approached.\u201cYour Highness is refined. You came so early today,\u201d Xiao Meng slightly bowed toward Ji Chengxue with a straight face, while Xiao Xiaolong and Xiao Yanyu stood behind him.Xiao Yanyu\u2019s complexion was much better. It seemed that the Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup had taken effect.\u201cGeneral Xiao, I\u2019ve made a fool of myself. Since I am setting off tomorrow, I came here to eat Owner Bu\u2019s dishes for one last time so that I wouldn\u2019t be craving for his food during the campaign.\u201d Ji Chengxue chuckled as he filled his own cup and another one for Xiao Meng.Xiao Meng was silent for a moment, before he sighed and received the cup of wine from Ji Chengxue.The two of them sat down and began to drink.Ouyang Xiaoyi informed Bu Fang about the dishes that the Xiao family had ordered and he indicated that he understood.Dish after dish of overwhelmingly fragrant dishes were brought out by Ouyang Xiaoyi and placed onto the table. These were all ordered by Ji Chengxue. He was enjoying himself as he drank while eating the delicious food.\u201cGeneral Xiao, how has my elder sister been doing recently?\u201d Ji Chengxue took a sip of wine and said as he looked toward Xiao Meng with a complicated gaze.Xiao Meng slightly frowned and finished the cup of wine in a single gulp. He lightly breathed out and gloomily said, \u201cShe\u2019s still in a comatose state as always. The imperial physicians don\u2019t understand the reason either. It\u2019s already been three years and I still don\u2019t know when Ru\u2019Er will wake up.\u201d\u201cSister has always been such a kind person, heaven will certainly help her. I am sure she\u2019ll wake up one day,\u201d Ji Chengxue consoled him.Ji Ru\u2019Er was the elder sister of Ji Chengxue, the wife of Xiao Meng, and the mother of Xiao Yue. Three years prior, Xiao Yue used the blood from his mother\u2019s heart as an offering to comprehend the true essence of the way of the sword and caused Ji Ru\u2019Er to fall into a coma. Now that three years had passed, there was still no indication of Ji Ru\u2019Er waking up.Within the past three years, Xiao Meng had searched the entire Light Wind Empire for extraordinary individuals and doctors with exceptional skills in order to wake up Ji Ru\u2019Er, but there had been no results.Because of this matter, his hair had turned white from worry. For a seventh grade Battle-Saint, this was something unbelievable.\u201cActually, I don\u2019t dare to hope for it anymore. Even though Ru\u2019Er is still in a coma, I am already contented that she\u2019s still alive. I came here today to inquire Owner Bu whether there\u2019s a way to wake up Ru\u2019Er. I am only grasping at straws here,\u201d Xiao Meng honestly told Ji Chengxue about his objective in visiting the store.Ji Chengxue nodded in agreement. If Bu Fang\u2019s medicinal cuisine could help Xiao Yanyu to recover from a severe loss of life force when she was close to dying, there was a chance that it could wake up his elder sister.He could not help but feel a sense of hope as well.The both of them did not speak any further and continued to drink the wine. Within this period, Xiao Meng only exhorted Ji Chengxue about taking note of certain matters during the campaign.Even though Ji Chengxue was a prince, he was the third son after all. His mother was only a concubine with a lowly status. He was neither comparable to the crown prince, Ji Chengan, nor to King Yu, Ji Chengyu, and he was also not favored by the emperor himself. If Xiao Meng was not his brother-in-law, the third prince could have already been erased by the crown prince or King Yu.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThere was a reason behind the saying, \u201cThe royalty has no relatives\u201d.\u201cYou must take care of your own safety during the campaign. Remember, even though His Majesty doesn\u2019t favor you, you\u2019re still a prince,\u201d Xiao Meng seriously said.Ji Chengxue indifferently nodded and gulped down a cup of wine.As the two of them chatted while drinking, the sound of coughing rang out from outside as an elderly figure slowly walked into the store.The gaze of Ji Chengxue and Xiao Meng naturally shifted toward the person who just arrived. Their expressions immediately froze and their eyes were filled with incredulity.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Their eyes were filled with incredulity.\u201cYour Majesty?! Why are you here?\u201d Xiao Meng hurriedly stood up and went forward to meet the emperor. The stunned expression on his face had still not dissipated. The fact that the emperor himself would visit a store situated within an alleyway was out of anyone\u2019s expectations.\u201cYour son and subject greets father emperor[1],\u201d Ji Chengxue stood up as well and saluted the elderly man.Even though the elderly man\u2019s hair had turned white, his mental state was still pretty good. He wore a beautiful robe and his hair was fixed in place with a green jade hairpin. With his hands placed behind his back, he was exuding a grandeur and refined aura.\u201cGeneral Xiao? Chengxue? Are you eating at this store as well? Looks like the food here should be pretty good.\u201d Ji Changfeng faintly smiled as he stepped into the store. He was coughing as he walked and his body swayed with every step. He gave off the feeling of someone who had one foot in his grave.Xiao Meng hurriedly supported him, fearing that the emperor would suffer a mishap.\u201cYour Majesty, why are you out here alone? This is unsafe. Even though the experts from the clan hiding within the imperial city have mostly retreated, there\u2019s no guarantee that there\u2019s none of them hiding around,\u201d Xiao Meng anxiously said.The emperor waved him off and simply said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Back in the day, I was still considered someone who awed the world. Even though I\u2019ve grown old, not just anyone would dare to approach me. I came here today to talk about food and not anything else.\u201dThe emperor sat down on a chair and surveyed the surroundings. The space within the store was not big. There were a few neatly placed tables and the decorations were quite cozy. There was a certain sense of charm.The emperor sniffed the air and his gaze shifted toward the table that Xiao Meng and Ji Chengxue were previously sitting at. His eyes slightly lit up as he said, \u201cThe aroma of this wine is truly rich. Could this be the fine wine that is better than the Bejewelled Nectar Wine?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty. This is the wine exclusive to this store, the Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine. A jar costs fifteen crystals,\u201d Xiao Meng said with a nod.\u201cFifteen crystals\u2026 that\u2019s not cheap. However, I am even more anxious to taste it now. Where\u2019s the owner? I want to meet him and order the dishes at the same time,\u201d the emperor asked.Ouyang Xiaoyi was shyly looking at the emperor with her eyes widened. When she heard his words, she turned to the kitchen window and shouted, \u201cSmelly boss, the emperor grandpa wishes to meet you.\u201d\u201cHmm? Who?\u201d Bu Fang\u2019s indifferent voice rang out from the kitchen, accompanied by the sound of stir frying.\u201cThe emperor grandpa,\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi earnestly repeated herself.\u201cOh, let him wait,\u201d Bu Fang\u2019s indifferent voice drifted out but Ouyang Xiaoyi was dumbfounded by his words.The little loli was exasperated. Whenever she spoke with Bu Fang, she felt like vomiting blood from exasperation.The person that wanted to meet him was the emperor, the number one person within the Light Wind Empire as well as the supreme ruler. What did he mean by letting him wait?Ji Changfeng and the others had heard the complete dialogue between Bu Fang and Ouyang Xiaoyi and their expressions were inexplicably wonderful.Xiao Meng and Ji Chengxue did not know how to respond. They thought, \u201cThis Owner Bu\u2026 His character is still as eccentric as always. He doesn\u2019t even give face to the emperor.\u201dOn the other hand, Ji Changfeng was amused and thought it was interesting. If ordinary chefs heard his title, they would hurriedly come and fawn over him. There was not a single case like Bu Fang where he was completely ignored.\u201cThis owner\u2026 has an interesting character.\u201d Ji Changfeng faintly smiled as he stroked his beard.Xiao Meng and Ji Chengxue awkwardly smiled along as well.Finally, after a few minutes, Bu Fang walked out of the kitchen. He was holding a plate of Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs in his hand. The rich aroma of the meat spread out and enveloped the entire store. The tangerine color of the Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs was tantalizing.\u201cHere\u2019s your Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs, please enjoy your meal,\u201d Bu Fang simply said as he placed the plate on Ji Chengxue\u2019s table.Then he turned around and looked toward the elderly man sitting on the chair. He thought, \u201cThis must be the emperor grandpa that Xiaoyi mentioned.\u201d\u201cHello, emperor,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly said.Everyone was startled. The emperor was stunned for a moment and started laughing while stroking his beard.\u201cHello, young man. Are you the owner of this store? What\u2019s the name of that dish just now? It\u2019s very fragrant.\u201d The emperor had a gentle smile on his face as he looked at Bu Fang. He thought that the owner was interesting.\u201cOh, the name of the dish is Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs. It\u2019s the most expensive dish in the store for now,\u201d Bu Fang simply said.\u201cSweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs\u2026 With such an alluring smell, I am looking forward to it. Good.\u201d The emperor nodded with a chuckle.\u201cThe menu is behind you, tell me what you want to eat. The Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine is limited to three jars per day and there\u2019s only one jar left today,\u201d Bu Fang said as he pointed to the menu behind the emperor.The emperor was surprised for a moment. He turned his head and saw the menu on the wall filled with dishes with astronomical prices.The emperor frowned and lightly coughed a few times. Then he asked, \u201cInteresting, a bowl of improved Egg-Fried Rice actually costs ten crystals. Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs\u2026 fifty crystals per serving. Why are they being sold at such an expensive price?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s naturally a reason why the price is so expensive. Our store has a strict standard when it comes to the ingredients, handling process, and cooking process. Not only are our dishes delicious, but they can also promote the circulation and growth of true energy within a cultivator\u2019s body. These prices are\u2026 fair,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly said.\u201cYour dishes can promote cultivation? Even the meat of spirit beasts would lose most of its spirit energy after cooking. How do you manage to cook dishes that can promote cultivation?\u201d the emperor curiously asked.Bu Fang indifferently glanced at the emperor and said with a frown, \u201cThis is a secret.\u201dCough cough cough\u2026 Xiao Meng and the rest immediately coughed a few times. The mood became slightly awkward because of Bu Fang\u2019s reply.On the contrary, the emperor nodded. \u201cYou probably have a special handling method and cooking method. This is indeed a secret and should not be casually revealed.\u201d\u201cYoung man, then give me a serving of each of the dishes here. Let me taste this so-called dishes that can promote the circulation of true energy,\u201d the emperor said while stroking his beard as he calmly looked at Bu Fang.\u201cAlright, wait a moment. I\u2019ll cook your order once I\u2019ve finished cooking their dishes,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly replied with a nod before he turned around and headed toward the kitchen.This time, the emperor was frowning and slight unhappy as he asked, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you cooking mine first?\u201d\u201cFirst-come, first-served is the rule of the store,\u201d Bu Fang turned around at the entrance to the kitchen and replied.\u201cCough cough\u2026 Owner Bu, it\u2019s fine if our dishes are served later. Please serve His Majesty\u2019s order before ours,\u201d Xiao Meng awkwardly coughed and hurriedly said.Bu Fang expressionlessly glanced at Xiao Meng and simply said, \u201cI already said that this is the rule of the store. First-come, first-served\u2026 Since you ordered first, I\u2019ll cook your dish first.\u201dAfter Bu Fang finished speaking, he entered the kitchen and continued cooking the dishes.Xiao Meng was dumbfounded by Bu Fang\u2019s words. He did not know how to respond as he helplessly looked at Bu Fang.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe smile on the emperor\u2019s face had already disappeared and his unfathomable gaze was directed toward the kitchen as his fingers tapped on the table. He simply said, \u201cHe has an interesting character, but this character must be built on the basis of strength. I\u2019ll give him a chance. If his dishes are unable to impress me, then there\u2019s no need for this store to continue operating.\u201dThe emperor was still the emperor after all. As the supreme ruler, when was he ever ignored by anyone like this? Bu Fang\u2019s indifference incited the emperor\u2019s displeasure as well.Xiao Meng and Ji Chengxue suddenly felt their hearts skipped a beat. They were aware that the emperor was annoyed.\u2014[1] Your son and subject greets father and emperor.

The oppression coming from the emperor as he contemplated was causing Xiao Meng and Ji Chengxue to hold their breath.Emperor Changfeng was still Emperor Changfeng after all. He spent a few dozen years battling the sects outside of the borders and destroyed numerous sects that used to be incomparably glorious. The intimidating aura and killing intent exuded from his body was extremely concentrated.However, Xiao Meng was slightly frowning as he leaned over to the emperor\u2019s ear and softly whispered, \u201cYour Majesty\u2026 don\u2019t forget about the background of this store. The big black dog lying at the entrance is a supreme beast. There\u2019s going to be some difficulty if you wish to destroy this store.\u201dThe corner of the emperor\u2019s mouth slightly widened as he glanced at Xiao Meng and simply said, \u201cGreat General Xiao, I remembered that you said in your report that as long as someone doesn\u2019t cause trouble within the store, that supreme spirit beast would not intervene, am I correct?\u201dXiao Meng was slightly surprised for a moment. He did not understand why the emperor would ask such a question but he still solemnly nodded. \u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cThen, it\u2019s simple. The rules of this store is that as long as someone doesn\u2019t cause trouble within the store, the supreme spirit beast would be unable to intervene. There are many methods to ruin this store, but there aren\u2019t many methods that would allow us to both ruin the store and prevent the supreme spirit beast from intervening. However, it doesn\u2019t mean that there isn\u2019t any.\u201d The emperor\u2019s index finger lightly tapped the surface of the table and created a dull thud.Xiao Meng\u2019s pupils slightly constricted as he thought, \u201cThere are other methods? Could His Majesty find someone who could suppress a supreme spirit beast within the imperial city?\u201d\u201cGeneral Xiao, you\u2019re naturally unaware of various business tactics since you\u2019re constantly out in the field. Even though this store has a supreme spirit beast, it\u2019s still a store and there are certain rules that it follows. If I forbid anyone from patronising this store, do you still think it\u2019ll be able to continue operating?\u201d The emperor chuckled as he reminded Xiao Meng.A sudden realization dawned on Xiao Meng as a wondrous expression appeared on his face. He thought, \u201cThat\u2019s right. With the pride of the supreme spirit beast, as long as no one caused any trouble within the store, it would definitely not intervene. Targeting the business was the most simple and effective method.\u201d\u201cHaha, there\u2019s no need for General Xiao to worry. I am only speaking without thinking. As long as Owner Bu\u2019s dishes are able to satisfy me, why would I interfere with his business?\u201d The emperor started to chuckle while stroking his beard.\u201cXiaoyi, serve the dish,\u201d Bu Fang called out. While the others had been chatting outside, he had completed another dish.\u201cSmelly boss\u2026 If your dishes don\u2019t satisfy the emperor grandpa, he\u2019s going to forbid others from entering your store,\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi leaned into the kitchen and softly whispered to Bu Fang while she was picking up the dish.Bu Fang expressionlessly nodded and did not seem to care in slightest as he replied, \u201cOh.\u201d\u201cEh? Smelly boss, are you not worried?\u201d Xiaoyi was pouting as she asked. She was reminding the smelly boss out of the kindness of her heart and he actually responded with an indifferent attitude. How exasperating!Bu Fang patted Xiaoyi\u2019s head and said with a smirk, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to worry. There\u2019s no one who wouldn\u2019t be satisfied by the food made by this God of Cooking.\u201dOuyang Xiaoyi went into a daze as she stared at Bu Fang, who was filled with confidence. Her eyes were almost shooting out stars as she thought, \u201cThe confident smelly boss is really handsome!\u201d\u201cGo, don\u2019t let the customers wait,\u201d Bu Fang said.Ouyang Xiaoyi nodded and eagerly carried the dish toward Ji Chengxue\u2019s table.\u201cYour Highness big brother, here\u2019s your Lees Fish. Please enjoy your meal,\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi charmingly said as she placed the Lees Fish in front of Ji Chengxue.Ji Chengxue nodded. He subconsciously glanced toward the emperor and discovered that the latter was attracted by the mixed aroma between wine and fish of the Lees Fish.The emperor\u2019s gaze had drifted toward the Lees Fish. His face filled with wrinkles was slightly trembling and he seemed to be swallowing his saliva.\u201cFather\u2026 Would you like to give this a try?\u201d Ji Chengxue respectfully asked.When the emperor heard Ji Chengxue\u2019s words, he shifted his gaze away and simply said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need, eat it yourself. I\u2019ve already ordered mine\u2026 By the way, what\u2019s the name of this dish?\u201d\u201cLees Fish,\u201d Ji Chengxue respectfully replied.The emperor nonchalantly nodded. He slightly closed his eyes and stopped paying any attention to his surroundings.Ji Chengxue sighed. His gaze while looking at the emperor was slightly gloomy as he thought, \u201cWhy does father dislike me so much\u2026 I am your son as well and I\u2019ve also been fighting at the frontlines. Why can\u2019t you give me the slightest concern at all?\u201dXiao Meng felt helpless as well. He walked toward Ji Chengxue\u2019s table and poured a cup of wine. The both of them clinked their cups together and started drinking together.As the rich fragrance of the dishes continuously drifted out from the kitchen, the emperor\u2019s eyelids that were tightly shut slightly twitched and his eyes finally opened.Having finished his food, Ji Chengxue stood up and respectfully saluted the emperor. He said in a calm tone, \u201cFather, I still need to attend the campaign ceremony, so I\u2019ll be leaving early.\u201dThe emperor nodded and waved his hand to indicate that he could leave.Ji Chengxue meaningfully glanced at the emperor\u2019s figure and his eyes focused for a moment. Then he turned around and left as the sleeves of his robe fluttered like rolling waves.\u201cXiaoyi, serve the dish,\u201d Bu Fang\u2019s voice rang out from the kitchen once more.Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s eyes lit up. She knew that the next dish was for the emperor. She was waiting for this moment just to watch the scene when the emperor was subdued by Bu Fang\u2019s dish.The improved Egg-Fried Rice was overwhelmingly fragrant. The light golden and viscous egg fluid wrapped around the pearl-like rice grains seemed to be emitting a faint radiance that was captivating to the eyes.\u201cEmperor grandpa, here\u2019s your improved Egg-Fried Rice.\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi placed the plate of Egg-Fried Rice in front of the emperor and her large eyes were filled with expectation as she looked at him.\u201cGood, good. Xiaoyi, why are you working here as a waitress? Did your grandfather agree to this?\u201d The emperor gently said as he patted Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s head with a kind smile.\u201cHmph, if grandpa dares to prevent me from coming here, I\u2019ll pull his beard!\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi gleefully said while her eyes narrowed into a slit.The emperor was laughing as his gaze shifted toward the Egg-Fried Rice. With this look, his gaze changed.As the emperor, his requirement toward food was very strict. Inside of the imperial palace, the chefs within the imperial kitchen were all carefully selected among tens of thousands of chefs within the Light Wind Empire. They were all elites within the culinary world.The dishes that he had tasted were innumerous and his evaluation ability toward food was incomparable to ordinary people.Regarding the plate of Egg-Fried Rice, putting aside the fragrance, the appearance itself had already completely attracted his attention. It was cooked not like those traditional Egg-Fried Rice. The eggs of Bu Fang\u2019s Egg-Fried Rice were eighty percent well-done and were poured onto the rice grains like a sauce.The emperor used a porcelain spoon to lightly scoop up a spoonful of rice, and the egg fluid left a string-like trail as he lifted it up. Hot air was rising up from the gaping hole created and was accompanied by a fragrance as it assaulted his nostrils. He was completely enveloped by the smell and it seemed as if he had fallen into a sea of fragrance.As he shoved the spoonful of Egg-Fried Rice into his mouth, the egg fluid, that was eighty percent well-done, instantly solidified. It was filled with springiness and produced a peculiar feeling as it ricocheted off his tongue and mouth walls.Gulp!After finishing a mouthful of Egg-Fried Rice, the emperor could not help but scoop another spoonful\u2026 It was completely a subconscious movement.\u201cIt\u2019s so fragrant! It\u2019s so delicious!\u201d The emperor\u2019s eyes completely lit up. He had not eaten such a delicious food for a long time, food that was able to widen all the pores on his entire body.While the emperor was enjoying the Egg-Fried Rice, Ouyang Xiaoyi was once again carrying another dish over. It was the overwhelmingly fragrant Fish Head Tofu Soup that was contained within a large blue and white porcelain bowl.The milky-white soup was rocking within the bowl. The barely noticeable jade-like tofu was brilliantly glowing while the tender fish was exuding a meaty aroma.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cEmperor grandpa, eating Egg-Fried Rice while drinking Fish Head Tofu Soup is the most comfortable thing to do. Here, try Xiaoyi\u2019s most favorite Fish Head Tofu Soup.\u201dWhen Ouyang Xiaoyi saw the emperor\u2019s intoxicated expression, she was extremely happy like a flower had bloomed within her heart. She placed the bowl of Fish Head Tofu Soup in front of the emperor and even personally filled a small bowl for him.When the milky-white fish soup that exuded a rich fragrance was matched with the rice fragrance from the Egg-Fried Rich, the emperor\u2019s appetite was immediately triggered as he felt hunger pangs coming from his stomach.After tasting a mouthful of fish soup, the flavor of the fish and the aroma of the tofu blossomed at the tip of his tongue and enveloped his taste buds. He could not help but exclaim, \u201cThis fish soup\u2026 Excellent!\u201dFrom a distance, Xiao Meng breathed out a sigh of relief as he thought, \u201cYour Majesty, it\u2019s great that you\u2019re happy. As long as you\u2019re happy, you won\u2019t think of interfering with Owner Bu\u2019s store and I won\u2019t need to face the supreme spirit beast. Everybody is happy.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In front of them, Lian Fu, who was wearing a brocade robe, was anxiously pacing around while waving a horsetail whisk. Once in a while, he would pause for a moment and look toward the store with concern in his eyes.\u201cHis Majesty is too much. It\u2019s not like I would snatch his food, why doesn\u2019t he let me accompany him?\u201d Lian Fu dissatisfiedly sighed. He spread his senses and alertly scanned the surroundings. It was not a small matter that the emperor left the imperial palace. If the experts from the sects found out, they would flock toward their location to assassinate him.Suddenly, a disturbance occurred among the guards. As they created a path, a refined figure slowly walked through.\u201cYour Highness is here as well. What a coincidence,\u201d Lian Fu said with a chuckle as he pinched his thumb and middle finger together.Ji Chengxue\u2019s mood was slightly indifferent. He only nodded before he walked away. His robes were fluttering as he left a breeze in his wake.Lian Fu was feeling helpless as he watched Ji Chengxue\u2019s back figure. He thought, \u201cIt looks like His Highness met His Majesty within the store and they didn\u2019t get along.\u201cThe royalty has no relatives. As someone from the imperial household, you\u2019ll need to face imperial matters. Since His Majesty doesn\u2019t like the third prince, it doesn\u2019t matter how diligent or outstanding he is.\u201d\u201cPay attention! His Majesty is currently inside the alleyway. If something happens to His Majesty, you all know the consequences!\u201d Lian Fu whispered a warning to the guards.\u201cOh my, isn\u2019t this Chief Eunuch Lian? It\u2019s been a while!\u201d A fawning voice rang out and interrupted Lian Fu who was about to give a long lecture to the guards.Lian Fu puzzledly glanced at the man who just approached. The figure in front of him was thin and had an ugly and vulgar appearance. He was wearing a luxurious brocade robe with a belt inlaid with green jade at his waist and his fingers were adorned with glittering rings. He had the appearance of a nouveau riche.\u201cYou are?\u201d Lian Fu puzzled asked. He thought, \u201cI don\u2019t seem to recall being acquainted with such a vulgar-looking old man.\u201d\u201cChief Eunuch Lian, did you forget about me? I am the owner of Phoenix Immortal Restaurant. Didn\u2019t His Majesty come over to eat the Roasted Flower Duck previously? At that time, I was the one who personally served the dish!\u201d the man who approached said with a smile while his eyes narrowed into a slit. He did not seem to mind that Lian Fu had forgotten about him.\u201cOh oh oh! You\u2019re called\u2026 Qian\u2026 Qian whatever something?\u201d Lian Fu said as he narrowed his eyes and pointed toward the man with his thumb and middle finger pinched together.\u201cGong gong, this lowly person\u2019s name is Qian Bao,\u201d the man reminded him.Lian Fu suddenly remembered as he nodded and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right, you\u2019re Qian Bao\u2026 Oh my, what\u2019s the owner of the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant doing here?\u201d\u201cThis lowly person passed by and came to greet after seeing gong gong. It\u2019s been a while since gong gong has come to Immortal Phoenix Restaurant for a meal, when would you have the time to patronise our restaurant? Your presence would certainly bring great honor to our humble restaurant.\u201d Qian Bao was smiling brightly.The dishes of Immortal Phoenix Restaurant were indeed pretty good. It was considered a first class restaurant within the Light Wind Empire. However, after Lian Fu had eaten the dishes made by Bu Fang, even the food from the imperial kitchen tasted bland to him. There was no way he would visit the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant.Other than Immortal Phoenix Restaurant\u2019s signature dish, the Roasted Flower Duck, the standard of its other dishes were out of the question.\u201cOh, I\u2019ll go when I have the time,\u201d Lian Fu absent-mindedly nodded and replied in a nonchalant manner.\u201cAlright, then this lowly person shall respectfully wait for gong gong\u2019s arrival.\u201d The smile on Qian Bao\u2019s face remained throughout the conversation. Regardless of Lian Fu\u2019s attitude, he was always smiling brightly.After a while, Qian Bao carefully asked, \u201cThat\u2026 Gong gong, is His Majesty currently inside the alleyway?\u201dLian Fu\u2019s eyes widened as he alertly looked at Qian Bao. He was frowning as he said in a high pitched voice, \u201cWhat sort of intentions are you harboring by asking this question?\u201d\u201cThis lowly person only wishes His Majesty to honor our humble restaurant with his presence once more. Didn\u2019t His Majesty praise our Roasted Flower Duck as the number one duck within the Light Wind Empire? This lowly person was only wondering when His Majesty would taste Immortal Phoenix Restaurant\u2019s dishes once more,\u201d Qian Bao hurriedly said as he waved his hand.\u201cIf His Majesty wishes to eat, he would naturally send someone to retrieve the food. What are you so anxious about? You\u2019re dismissed,\u201d Lian Fu indifferently snorted and said after glancing at Qian Bao.Qian Bao was still smiling as he nodded and asked to be excused. Then he turned around and left. After taking a few steps, the smile on his face gradually disappeared and was quickly replaced by a gloomy expression.\u201cThe black-hearted store in the alleyway\u2026 Even His Majesty came in person? I was wondering why all the precious customers had disappeared recently. So they were all attracted by this little store,\u201d Qian Bao lowered his head as he muttered to himself with a gloomy expression.\u201cHow dare you steal my business\u2026 I will definitely make you suffer. You\u2019re just a little store situated within an alleyway that relies on a signature dish. Hmph\u2026 Once this signature dish of yours is defeated, we\u2019ll see how you manage to steal my business!\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cEmperor grandpa, this is the Lees Fish. Please enjoy your meal,\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi charmingly said as she placed the plate of Lees Fish in front of the emperor. As the wine aroma spread into the air, the emperor could not help but take a deep breath.\u201cThe intensely aromatic Lees Fish, it\u2019s very fragrant!\u201d The emperor praised as he impatiently picked up a pink piece of fish with his chopsticks. As the fish entered his mouth, the taste of the lees and flavor of the fish mixed together and enveloped his taste buds. He was captivated by the flavor.\u201cEmperor grandpa, this is the Golden Shumai. Please enjoy your meal.\u201dAs another dish was served, the interior of the store was completely enveloped by the fragrance of the dishes.The emperor was grinning from ear to ear as he ate the dish. His mouth was constantly chewing and he was unable to stop at all. It had been a long time since he had tasted food that was able to captivate him.Wiping off the oil stains on his beard, an overjoyed expression appeared on the emperor\u2019s face as he stared at the first-rate dishes in front of him. For a glutton like him, tasting delicious food was the happiest experience.\u201cXiaoyi, isn\u2019t there a wine that\u2019s better than the imperial palace\u2019s Bejewelled Nectar Wine? Why haven\u2019t I seen it yet?\u201d the emperor puzzled asked after contentedly swallowing a piece of Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs.\u201cThere is. Emperor grandpa, wait a moment.\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi grinned and cheerfully ran toward the kitchen window.\u201cSmelly boss, hurry up and bring out the Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine. The emperor grandpa wants a taste,\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi said to Bu Fang.Bu Fang had finished cooking the last dish and was wiping away the water droplets on his hands. He nodded and let Ouyang Xiaoyi serve the final dish first, while he took out the last jar of Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine from the cabinet.Bu Fang walked out of the kitchen while carrying the jar of wine.He placed the jar in front of the emperor and sat down at a seat. He looked at the emperor and simply asked, \u201cHow is it? Do you still want to shut down my store?\u201dThe emperor was curiously picking up verdant and glistening vegetables that seemed to be completely uncooked. When he heard Bu Fang\u2019s question, a trace of embarrassment flashed across his face. However, the embarrassment soon vanished.When he bit down on the vegetables, a warm vegetable juice immediately gushed into his mouth. The light flavor of the vegetables lingered in his mouth.\u201cThis is Stir-Fried Vegetables?!\u201d The emperor was extremely surprised after taking a bite.\u201cAs you\u2019ve seen, this is indeed a plate of Stir-Fried Vegetables. It\u2019s just that the stir-fry process used a special cooking technique,\u201d Bu Fang simply said.As Bu Fang was speaking, he removed the cloth cover of the wine jar and poured a cup of wine for the emperor. He pointed toward the cup and beckoned the emperor to have a taste.The emperor\u2019s eyes immediately lit up. The fragrance of the Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine had already lured out the wine bug within his body and his craving for it was almost unbearable.He picked up the blue and white porcelain cup and sipped the wine. The spiciness flowed through his lips to his tongue and suddenly blossomed. The emperor\u2019s entire body shuddered and even the wrinkles on his face seemed to be pulsing.After finishing the cup of wine, the emperor smacked his lips as he lightly breathed out. He had a captivated expression on his face.\u201cThe rumors were really true. The Ice Heart Jade Urn wine is indeed better than my Bejewelled Nectar Wine\u2026 I\u2019ve lived for so many years and only tasted such a wine when I have one foot in the grave. Is this a punishment from the heavens or a reward?\u201d the emperor did not know whether to laugh or cry as he exclaimed with his narrowed eyes.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWith such a fine wine and this sort of delicious food, if I still decide to seal Owner Bu\u2019s store, then I would be truly foolish.\u201d The emperor lightly stroked his beard as he beckoned Bu Fang to fill his cup. He drank another cup of wine and started laughing.Bu Fang expressionlessly looked at the laughing emperor, as if everything was within his expectations.Just like he believed, there was no stomach that could not be subdued by his dishes!The emperor consecutively drank three cups of wine and the wine was starting to take effect, but his eyes were even brighter.The emperor stared at Bu Fang and slammed his cup down with a thud. His eyes were shining as he said, \u201cOwner Bu, work under me. Come to my imperial kitchen. Your monthly salary will be\u2026 ten thousand crystals!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His eyes were slightly unfocused as he thought, \u201cHmm? How much did the emperor say my monthly salary would be just now? Ten thousand crystals?\u201d\u201cMy host, as someone aiming to become the God of Cooking, your pure goal should not be corrupted by materialism. You must strengthen your resolve and not be affected by riches! You must use your own hands to create a beautiful future.\u201dThe system\u2019s solemn encouragement shattered Bu Fang\u2019s delusions, whose resolve was slightly shaken. The corner of Bu Fang\u2019s mouth widened into a smile.Bu Fang indifferently looked at the emperor with steady eyes and simply asked, \u201cWhy should I work under you?\u201dThe confident smile on the emperor\u2019s face suddenly froze and he said with a frown, \u201cBecause I am the emperor, the supreme ruler. Don\u2019t I have the qualifications to hire you as the imperial chef?\u201cThere are countless chefs in the world who desire to enter the imperial kitchen, just to have a chance to cook a dish for me\u2026\u201d\u201cIs the emperor that incredible? If they wish to go, then let them go.\u201d Bu Fang simply said. His gaze was calm. He was neither arrogant nor overbearing. It was as if he was declaring an ordinary matter.The emperor suddenly froze. Even Xiao Meng who was observing the both of them in a distance was startled as well.When the emperor recovered from his stupor, the corner of his mouth was twitching. Bu Fang was probably the only person in the world who would dare to speak to him in such a manner\u2026 However, there was nothing he could do to Bu Fang within the store.\u201cDon\u2019t waste your energy. I won\u2019t be swayed by anyone. If you want to eat my dishes, just come to my store. As for going to that so-called imperial kitchen, I have no interest at all,\u201d Bu Fang simply said as he stood up. His tone was calm, as if he was simply drinking water.The emperor meaningfully glanced at Bu Fang and nodded. He did not persist. There were some things where you only need to ask in order to know the result.\u201cWhat an idealistic and ambitious chef,\u201d the emperor thought. He no longer said anything as he narrowed his eyes and enjoyed the comfortable feeling brought by the Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine.After eating for a while, the emperor finally finished his meal. As he cleaned his beard, the wrinkles on his face seemed to have come alive.\u201cExcellent! Delicious! It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve tasted such delicious dishes! You deserve to be rewarded!\u201d The emperor said while stroking his beard, \u201cAs for the reward\u2026 it\u2019s hard to decide.\u201dBu Fang went into a daze. He did not expect the emperor to offer such a proposal.The emperor held his hands behind his back as he glanced around the store. Suddenly, an unfathomable smile appeared on his face.\u201cOwner Bu, I\u2019ve already thought of a reward for you. Ordinary crystals would be far too vulgar and you wouldn\u2019t be able to use expensive elixirs. I saw that your store still doesn\u2019t have a signboard, so how about I personally name your store?\u201d The emperor benevolently looked at Bu Fang.From his point of view, Bu Fang would definitely not reject this reward. With a signboard personally written by the emperor, the fame of the store would definitely rise up and become completely well-known within the Light Wind Empire. It was a reward far more practical for a store than crystals.\u201cNotice to the host, the store\u2019s interior furnishing are to be completed by the system. The store\u2019s signboard system has already been prepared. The host must not accept any signboard given by others.\u201dBu Fang already knew that, with the system\u2019s proudful nature, it would definitely not allow him to accept such a bountiful reward.\u201cI am grateful for your kind intentions. If you like my dishes, you can patronize the store often. As for the matter regarding the signboard, there\u2019s no need for that. The store\u2019s furnishing are well enough, so there\u2019s no need for any changes,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly said as he ignored his conscience and rejected the emperor\u2019s kind intentions once more.The emperor was feeling really embarrassed. He was mercilessly rejected by Bu Fang when he tried to entice Bu Fang into working under him. Now, he was even rejected when he wanted to name the store\u2026The black-hearted store was indeed first class at being arrogant, but it had the qualifications to do so.\u201cGood, very good! Then, I thank Owner Bu for your hospitality.\u201d The emperor indifferently nodded with an expressionless face. He placed down some crystals and left under Xiao Meng\u2019s escort.Due to the emperor\u2019s visit, many of the store\u2019s regular customers were unable to enter.Xushi was originally planning to eat Boiled Fish that day. However, when he arrived at the entrance of the alleyway, he discovered a large crowd blocking his way. He was shocked by the imposing spectacle and only understood the whole story after asking around.\u201cMy heavens, even His Majesty personally visited Owner Bu\u2019s store! I must immediately inform His Highness about this!\u201d Xushi was startled. He could not care about eating anymore as he turned around and left.At the same moment, the fact that the emperor personally visited a restaurant located within an alleyway was quickly spread among the entire imperial city.The emperor was famous and the so-called celebrity effect was just like that. Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store had truly become renowned this time. Due to the emperor\u2019s fame, it was completely well-known within the imperial city. Almost every rich and influential person knew about this information.\u201cWhat did you say? Did father really visited the store personally?\u201dOn the left side of the Gate of Heavenly Mystery and within the majestic palace of the crown prince, Xushi truthfully reported the information to the crown prince. The crown prince\u2019s pupils immediately constricted and he suddenly stood up.\u201cYes, Your Highness. The entrance to the alleyway was completely sealed off by Chief Eunuch Lian and his men\u2026\u201d Xushi said.The crown prince held his hands behind his back as he paced a few steps. Then he raised his head and asked, \u201cXushi, Is there any news about the Blood Phoenix Chicken that I told you to search for?\u201d\u201cYour Highness\u2026 there is news. It will arrive at the imperial city after a few more days,\u201d Xushi said as he bowed.Ji Chengan nodded with a grave expression. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether father found out about the Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup during his visit. Once father finds about this information, I\u2019ll have to immediately present the Blood Phoenix Chicken. If father does not know\u2026 I will personally bring the ingredients and let Owner Bu cook the Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup.\u201dThe crown prince massaged his fingers as the corners of his mouth curled up.\u2026King Yu\u2019s manor, center of the garden.King Yu, Ji Chengyu, was wearing casual clothes with his hair down. He was holding crystal dust in his hand as he slowly walked around the pond located at the center of the garden. From time to time, he would pinch a little bit of crystal dust and toss it into the pond.Once the crystal dust entered the pond, fishes with various colors swimming in the water vied over the sparse amount of crystal dust.A red fish, that was unable to snatch any of the crystal dust, immediately wriggled its body angrily within the pond. Its mouth opened widely and revealed a set of sharp teeth as it swallowed a fish that managed to snatch away the crystal dust.A faint smell of blood spread into the air from the middle of the pond\u2026King Yu had a joyful expression on his face, but his gaze was slightly cold as he looked at the fish that devoured the other fish.\u201cIf even a fish knows to compete, how could someone from the royal family be compassionate? Every single contention is accompanied by a bloody battle\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euKing Yu softly muttered. Suddenly, a series of footsteps rang out from behind him.Several figures appeared behind him. They were all wearing black robes and a faint amount of true energy hovered around them.\u201cYou\u2019re finally here.\u201d The corner of King Yu\u2019s mouth curled up as he tossed the remaining crystal dust into the pond and slowly turned around.One of the figures raised his hands and took off his hood, revealing a gaunt looking face. He had deep sunken eyes and there seemed to be a spirit fire pulsing within his pupils.\u201cHead elder of Soul Sect, Hun Qianyun, greets King Yu.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The pedestrians on the streets of the imperial city were starting to cover themselves in thick cotton-padded clothes. As they walked down the streets early in the morning, water vapour could be clearly seen coming from their mouth when they exhaled.Bang bang bang!A series of banging sounds came from the entrance. Bu Fang, who had just gotten up and was practicing the Meteor Cutting Technique in the kitchen, was slightly startled. He thought, \u201cWho would be knocking on the door at such an early hour?\u201dBu Fang lay down the kitchen knife in his hand and unhurriedly opened the entrance to the store. Reflected in his eyes was Ouyang Xiaoyi who was wearing a pink jacket. Her vivid, large eyes were blinking as she looked at Bu Fang.\u201cXiaoyi? Why are you here so early today?\u201d Bu Fang puzzledly asked. He thought, \u201cDoesn\u2019t she normally arrive after Fatty Jin and the rest have finished eating?\u201dXiaoyi was slightly out of breath, as if she had jogged all the way there. Her delicate face was faintly rosy and the tip of her nose had turned slightly red from the cold weather, increasing her adorableness.\u201cSmelly boss, His Highness big brother is leaving the imperial city and setting off today. Let\u2019s go and send him off,\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi expectantly said.Bu Fang went into a daze. He seemed to remember that Ji Chengxue mentioned something about leaving the imperial city and going on a campaign against the sects outside the border.When Bu Fang recalled Ji Chengxue had been patronizing his business all this time, he thought that he should at least send him off. So, he did not reject Ouyang Xiaoyi but nodded instead.\u201cWait for me,\u201d Bu Fang simply said as he turned around and went into the store. After a while, he took out a piece of wooden board.On the wooden board was written: Business is suspended today.After hanging the wooden board at the entrance, Bu Fang squatted down and stroked Blacky\u2019s supple and immaculate fur. He closed up the entrance of the store and left with Ouyang Xiaoyi.Bu Fang was wearing a cashmere overcoat that was tightly wrapped around his body and a dark gray scarf that was coiled around his neck to prevent the cold wind from slipping down his back.Ouyang Xiaoyi did not expect Bu Fang would readily agree to her invitation. She was originally just giving it a try when she came to inquire Bu Fang and was prepared to be rejected\u2026 However, results were often outside of people\u2019s expectations.The two of them walked toward the entrance of the alleyway. Xiao Xiaolong and Xiao Yanyu, the two good-looking siblings were standing nearby. Xiao Xanyu\u2019s face was covered with a veil and her impeccable appearance could not be seen. Her aura was refined and outstanding, as if a goddess had descended.Her injuries had already mostly recovered and basically did not hinder her movements. When Xiao Xiaolong noticed Bu Fang and Ouyang Xiaoyi, he began waving his arms from a distance.The two siblings were wearing white fur overcoats that fully revealed their dignified aura. When matched with their immaculate appearances, they provided a beautiful scenery on the street.\u201cOwner Bu, you actually agreed to come with us to send off His Highness?!\u201d Xiao Xiaolong stared at Bu Fang in amazement with an incredulous expression.Previously, when Ouyang Xiaoyi said that she wanted to invite Bu Fang, he thought that Bu Fang would definitely not agree, due to his cold personality. However, reality viciously slapped his face.\u201cWhy? Is it strange?\u201d Bu Fang simply said as he expressionlessly looked at Xiao Xiaolong.Xiao Xiaolong immediately laughed in an awkward manner and no longer said anything. Xiao Yanyu, who was standing next to him, looked toward Bu Fang. After a long while, she slightly bowed and gently said, \u201cThank you for saving me\u2026\u201dBu Fang nodded and it suddenly became quiet between the four of them. Then, they left the alleyway and headed toward the main streets of the imperial city.The early morning wind was slightly bone-chilling. Bu Fang tightened the scarf coiled around his neck as he curiously looked around. He rarely left the store and his impression of the imperial city was quite vague. Even though he had stayed within the imperial city for almost two months, he was still unfamiliar with the streets.On the sides of the street, as the sky gradually became brighter, the stall hawkers began to show up. They were curled up in the cold wind as they yelled to attract customers while water vapor came out from their mouths.On both sides of the street, there were also drowsy shop assistants that were yawning as they opened up for business. After resting for a night, the imperial city was gradually waking up in the morning light.Bu Fang did not conceal his curiosity, while Ouyang Xiaoyi cheerfully introduced the surrounding things and buildings to Bu Fang.\u201cIs that the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant? The so-called number one restaurant in the imperial city?\u201d Bu Fang suddenly said as he pointed toward a beautifully renovated three-floor building.Ouyang Xiaoyi and the others went into a daze for a moment and then nodded.Ouyang Xiaoyi pointed toward the flamboyant \u201cImmortal Phoenix Restaurant\u201d above the entrance and charmingly said, \u201cSmelly boss, those three characters were written by the emperor grandpa!\u201dAs Bu Fang looked, he discovered that the three characters were indeed filled with connotation. The emperor\u2019s calligraphy was still very good, unfortunately\u2026 If the system had not rejected, he might have agreed to the emperor\u2019s request at that moment.Because he wanted to quickly get a signboard for the store as well.\u201cAbrupt mission: my host, please taste the thirteen dishes of the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant, assess their merits and drawbacks, and find out three inadequate points of each dish by today.\u201d(People who succeed need to cover their weaknesses with their strengths. Young man, use your fussy tongue to find fault at the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant.)Mission reward: Ten percent of true energy cultivation progression, advanced cooking method of a dish from Immortal Phoenix Restaurant.Just as Bu Fang was sizing up the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant, a solemn voice rang out in his mind, causing him to space out on the spot.He thought, \u201cAnother abrupt mission? This time, I\u2019ll have to find fault using my tongue?\u201cFine\u2026 This mission definitely seems like something the system would give. However, covering weaknesses with strengths is not wrong.\u201dEven though Bu Fang had the help of the system, isolation was not helpful to his growth as someone aimed to become the God of Cooking.Furthermore, the rewards of the abrupt mission this time, ten percent of true energy cultivation progression and the cooking method of a new dish, were quite alluring to Bu Fang\u2026If he increased another ten percent of true energy cultivation progression, he would soon be able to become a fourth grade Battle-Spirit. When that time came, the system would level up and unlock more functions.\u201cSmelly boss, what are you spacing out for? We need to hurry up, otherwise we won\u2019t make it for His Highness big brother\u2019s sending off,\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi said as she tugged on Bu Fang\u2019s cashmere overcoat.Bu Fang turned his attention back to them and nodded. He meaningfully glanced at the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant once more, then followed their pace as they went down the wide main roads of the imperial city.Soon, the four of them reached the city gate. On both sides of the gate, a row of soldiers wearing metal armor were standing there. Their expressions were solemn and they were giving off a somber aura.Outside of the city walls, an army was orderly lined up in a formation. These troops were all soldiers of the third prince and his protection during the campaign against the sects.Ji Chengxue was not wearing a refined white robe that day, but a military uniform with a metal armor and helmet. His handsome face was not gentle as usual, but filled with a cold sternness.\u201cThank you for sending me off, Owner Bu. I feel honored.\u201d When Ji Chengxue noticed that Bu Fang actually appeared to send him off as well, he was feeling slightly surprised and warmth.\u201cYour Highness, you must take care of your body during the campaign. Your body is more important than anything else. Remember, you\u2019re still a prince!\u201d Xiao Meng solemnly exhorted.A campaign against the sects from outside of the border was not a joke and was extremely dangerous. A single mistake could cause the entire army to be annihilated. After all, the members of the sects from outside of the border were all experts. Even though the soldiers of the empire were strong, a powerful dragon could not suppress a snake in its lair. Even Emperor Changfeng was unable to completely annihilate these sects despite spending so many years battling them.Ji Chengxue nodded as he mounted a dark brown unicorn and grabbed its reins. He looked toward the direction of the majestic imperial palace. In his eyes, neither happiness nor sadness could be seen.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe orderly army slowly moved and gradually left the imperial city. They slowly disappeared in the horizon\u2026Once Ji Chengxue\u2019s figure had disappeared, Ouyang Xiaoyi turned around and said to Bu Fang, \u201cSmelly boss, now that we\u2019ve sent off His Highness, are we going back to the store to open for business?\u201dXiao Yanyu and Xiao Xiaolong looked toward their direction at the same time. If Bu Fang was going back to open the store, they would follow along as well. To be able to eat Bu Fang\u2019s dishes everyday was also a kind happiness.However, Bu Fang expressionlessly shook his head and looked toward the direction of the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant. The corner of his mouth rigidly curled up.\u201cLet\u2019s eat at the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant today and find out how the food from the number one restaurant in the imperial city tastes like\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Ah! Owner Bu\u2026 You want to eat at Immortal Phoenix Restaurant?\u201d When Xiao Xiaolong heard Bu Fang\u2019s words, his eyes immediately widened and his expression became a little strange.Xiao Yanyu and Ouyang Xiaoyi could not understand either. From their point of view, Bu Fang\u2019s culinary skills completely trounced the chefs of Immortal Phoenix Restaurant. What was he planning by going there?\u201cThere\u2019s naturally a reason that Immortal Phoenix Restaurant was able to become the number one restaurant within the imperial city. Furthermore, this great chef needs to learn as well. The sea can hold waters from a hundred rivers, it\u2019s only great\u2026 because of its capacity.\u201d Bu Fang simply said. He turned around and headed in the direction of Immortal Phoenix Restaurant.\u201cThe sea can hold waters from a hundred rivers, it\u2019s only great\u2026 because of its capacity.\u201d The corner of Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s mouth was twitching. He suddenly felt that there\u2019s something wrong with Bu Fang on that day.\u201cXiaoyi, don\u2019t you think there\u2019s something strange with Owner Bu today? I feel that he has an impure objective for going to Immortal Phoenix Restaurant!\u201d Xiao Xiaolong moved closer to Ouyang Xiaoyi and whispered in her ear.Ouyang Xiaoyi was slightly confused as she puzzledly asked, \u201cStrange? Not at all, what\u2019s so strange? You can only improve by learning more. This makes a lot of sense. Grandpa often says this to Xiaoyi as well.\u201dXiao Xiaolong twitched his mouth as he thought, \u201cFine, there\u2019s no point in talking to you.\u201dThe three of them hurriedly followed after Bu Fang and headed toward the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant.With regards to the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant, Xiao Xiaolong and the others were naturally familiar with it. Before Bu Fang\u2019s store appeared, the place they went the most was the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant. It was the number one restaurant within the imperial city after all and the taste of its dishes were definitely worthy to be recognized.Of course, that was only true when not being compared with Bu Fang\u2019s dishes.\u201cOwner Bu, since you\u2019re going to the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant, then do you know its rules?\u201d Xiao Xiaolong took a few more steps and was walking alongside of Bu Fang.\u201cRules? What sort of rules?\u201d Bu Fang was slightly puzzled as he turned his head and looked at Xiao Xiaolong.The corner of Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s mouth was twitching. He knew it. He was sure that Bu Fang\u2019s decision to go to Immortal Phoenix was made on the spur of the moment. However, even though he was dumbfounded, he still educated Bu Fang about certain things.\u201cAs the number one restaurant within the imperial city, the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant has three floors. The quality of the furnishing and attendants are different for each floor. The first floor is the general area for ordinary customers and the price of the dishes are not high. People from families that are slightly well-off can dine there a few times per month.\u201cThe second floor is the distinguished guests area. The Immortal Phoenix Restaurant put in a little effort on the furnishing. The attendant is also changed from a male waiter to a pretty waitress in a brocade dress. Just based on the service quality, it\u2019s already one of the best among the imperial city and even the entire empire. Furthermore, the dishes on the second floor are far more expensive than the first floor and the taste is much better as well.\u201cThe third floor is the supreme area. All of the services are top-notch. Be it the furnishing or the attendants, it\u2019s undoubtedly number one within the imperial city. Only those with a distinguished status can step onto this floor.\u201dXiao Xiaolong explained to Bu Fang. He introduced the different operating styles of the three floors.After hearing his explanation, Bu Fang narrowed his eyes and nodded. The owner of the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant had some brains after all. By having different operating styles based on floors, it would cause the customers to feel a difference in status and encourage expenditure. Customers from the general area would choose to go to the distinguished guest area due to the issue with face. On the other hand, customers that had been to the distinguished guest area would be unable to return to the general area due to the fear of losing face. This would increase the profits of the distinguished guest area and their earnings would definitely be bountiful.\u201cThe dishes from the supreme area on the third floor should be the best, right? Are you qualified to enter?\u201d Bu Fang suddenly asked after thinking for a while.\u201cSince it\u2019s the supreme area, only the most respectable people in the Light Wind Empire can enter. The children of court officials like us are not qualified. Some time ago, Sun Qixiang wanted to forcibly enter and was threw out by a sixth grade Battle-Emperor that was keeping watch,\u201d Xiao Xiaolong said.After hearing his words, Bu Fang began to frown. \u201cEven you\u2019re not qualified to enter that supreme area?\u201d\u201cOnly His Majesty, the Minister of the Right, my father, General Ouyang and others with similar statuses can enter,\u201d Xiao Xiaolong said while ambiguously mentioning the background of the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant.While the two of them were chatting, they already reached the beautifully furnished entrance of the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant.\u201cOh my, isn\u2019t this young master Xiao? It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen you. Are you here to eat today? Hurry, hurry and come in.\u201dWhen the four of them reached the entrance, a voluptuous, attractive middle-aged woman approached while swaying her hips as her enchanting voice filled with happiness rang out.Xiao Xiaolong elegantly smiled and nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while, elder sister Chun. Your figure has become even more sensual.\u201dThe attractive middle-aged woman called elder sister Chun immediately covered her smile and as she laughed, her chest began to lively bounce. Despite the freezing temperature, she was still exposing a snow white area at her chest and did not seem to be bothered by the weather in the slightest.The attractive middle-aged woman was smiling as she guided them into the interior of the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant.Bu Fang did not say anything. He only glanced at elder sister Chun\u2019s body once and indifferently looked away. His expression was solemn as he stepped into the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant. Once he entered, he could feel the popularity of the restaurant.The first floor was a vast hall with tables neatly set up. People were heartily having their meals at each table. From the expressions on their face, it was evident that they were very satisfied with the food.\u201cYoung master Xiao, is there only four of you? Are we going to the distinguished guest area?\u201d Elder sister Chun\u2019s hips were swaying as she guided them. As they walked, she turned around to chat with their group.\u201cYes, there\u2019s four of us. Elder sister Chun, arrange a table for us.\u201d Xiao Xiaolong nodded and was about to reply, when Bu Fang suddenly spoke up and interrupted him.\u201cWait, let\u2019s eat at the general area first. Arrange a table for us.\u201d\u201cEh? We\u2019re going to eat at the general area?\u201d This time, it was not only Xiao Xiaolong, even Xiao Yanyu and Ouyang Xiaoyi were surprised.\u201cYes, of course. You can go ahead to the distinguished guest area if you want. In any case, I\u2019ll head there after I\u2019ve finished eating at the general area,\u201d Bu Fang added.With this, the gaze of Xiao Xiaolong and the others became contemplative. Xiao Yanyu\u2019s lips, that were hidden under her veil, were even slightly curled up as she thought, \u201cThis Bu Fang\u2026 is trying to cause trouble.\u201d\u201cAlright. Elder sister Chun, prepare a table for us at the general area first,\u201d Xiao Xiaolong said to elder sister Chun with a smile.Elder sister Chun\u2019s pretty face was filled with suspicions. Her red phoenix eyes[1] shifted toward Bu Fang and quickly moved away after a single glance. She charmingly said, \u201cVery well, come with me.\u201dUnder elder sister Chun\u2019s arrangement, they were able to quickly sit down at a vacant table.Bu Fang was sitting upright as he removed the scarf coiled around his neck and his cashmere overcoat. His expression was solemn as he reached out his finger and brushed it against the surface of the table. An oily sense of feeling instantly emerged and his finger was stained by a jet-black grease.\u201cThe hygiene is terrible and poorly affects my appetite,\u201d Bu Fang coldly evaluated.Xiao Xiaolong, who had just sat down and was prepared to make an order, suddenly froze and bewilderedly looked at Bu Fang.Ouyang Xiaoyi and Xiao Yanyu were blinking as they looked strangely at Bu Fang.That voluptuous elder sister Chun was extremely embarrassed as she resentfully cursed in her mind, \u201cThis is the general area, the hygiene is naturally bad! Why are you so picky when you chose to come to the general area!\u201d\u201cBring me all of the dishes in the general area that you think are first-rate,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly said to elder sister Chun while seated down.\u201cAll of the first-rate dishes? There\u2019s ten first-rate dishes in the general area. Each dish costs five hundred silver coins. Are you sure you want all of them?\u201d Elder sister Chun suspiciously looked at Bu Fang.It was not that she did not trust Bu Fang, as he had arrived with Xiao Xiaolong after all. Xiao Xiaolong was the son of Great General Xiao Meng and would naturally have a lot of money. If the young man in front of her was Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s friend, he would naturally be well-off as well. However, if he did not lack money\u2026 what was he doing in the general area?\u201cElder sister Chun, just serve the dishes. He lacks everything but money,\u201d Xiao Xiaolong said to her with a chuckle.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSince Xiao Xiaolong had already spoken, elder sister Chun went to arrange for the dishes to be prepared.Once elder sister Chun was gone, Xiao Xiaolong made eyes at Bu Fang and said, \u201cOwner Bu, are you planning to try all of the dishes in Immortal Phoenix Restaurant?\u201dThe corner of Bu Fang\u2019s mouth widened into a smile as he indifferently glanced at Xiao Xiaolong and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right, I am here to find fault and cause trouble today.\u201d\u2014[1] Red phoenix eye(\u4e39\u51e4\u773c) \u2013 This is used to describe an eye type where the outer corner inclines upwards.

It truly fits Owner Bu\u2019s personality.\u201dXiao Xiaolong and the others were all dumbfounded. They clearly did not understand the reason for Bu Fang to find fault at the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant.\u201cOwner Bu\u2026 do you have a grudge against the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant?\u201d Xiao Yanyu\u2019s pleasant voice rang out as she softly asked. Evidently, it was not just Xiao Xiaolong, even someone as intelligent as her could not understand it.Bu Fang looked toward Xiao Yanyu and his eyes met her bright eyes. \u201cDo I need a reason to find fault with others? I came because I feel like doing it.\u201d\u201cFine\u2026 This reply is impeccable. It was a reply fitting for Owner Bu.\u201d Xiao Yanyu thought.Everyone stopped talking and quietly waited for the dishes to arrive. The general area was very noisy and various odors were drifting in the air. The aroma of poor quality wine and the strange smell of food mixed together and created an unbearable stench.Even Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s eyes were noticeably showing disdain. The Immortal Phoenix Restaurant might be well-known through the imperial city, but the hygiene within the general area was indeed terrible. The main reason was the high volume of customers, which made it difficult to upkeep the hygiene.\u201cYour dish is being served!\u201d A voice rang out as a waiter with a white towel hanging on his shoulder carried a dish while slowly approaching.\u201cGuests, here is your dish, the Red Braised Lion\u2019s Head!\u201d The waiter was smiling as he placed a steaming Red Braised Lion\u2019s Head on Bu Fang\u2019s table.The color of the Red Braised Lion\u2019s Head dipped in red sauce was gorgeous. It exuded fragrance as steam rose from the dish and dispersed in front of their eyes.\u201cThis Red Braised Lion\u2019s Head looks pretty good!\u201d Xiao Xiaolong nodded and said after glancing at the dish.He picked up his chopsticks and aligned them by lightly tapping them against the table before picking up one of the Lion\u2019s Head soaked in red sauce.Bu Fang expressionlessly picked up his chopsticks as well. He picked up one of the Lion\u2019s Head and moved it into his bowl. He first used his chopsticks to poke the Lion\u2019s Head to feel its hardness, then moved it closer to his nose and sniffed.One after another, Ouyang Xiaoyi and Xiao Yanyu took a bite of this Red Braised Lion\u2019s Head as well. The taste was pretty good, since it was one of the top ten signature dishes of Immortal Phoenix Restaurant\u2019s general area. Even though it could not be compared to Bu Fang\u2019s dishes, it was still pretty good when compared to ordinary dishes.Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s pretty face became rosy as she satisfiedly finished her Lion\u2019s Head within a few bites.Xiao Xiaolong smacked his lips and drank a mouthful of water. He picked up another Lion\u2019s Head and ate it. A plate of Red Braised Lion\u2019s Head only had five meatballs and he ate two of them by himself.\u201cOwner Bu, you should try this as well. The taste of this Lion\u2019s Head is quite good. The chef of Immortal Phoenix Restaurant still has some skills,\u201d Xiao Xiaolong said to Bu Fang as he chewed the Lion\u2019s Head.Bu Fang did not reply as he took a small bite. As the sauce entered his mouth, there was a slight astringent taste. After chewing a few times, Bu Fang swallowed and expressionlessly placed his chopsticks down. He did not continue eating.Bu Fang\u2019s actions caused Xiao Yanyu and the others to give him strange looks.\u201cThe sauce of this Red Braised Lion\u2019s Head is too salty. Clearly, too much salt was added. Furthermore, the sugar within the sauce did not completely dissolve, so it was slightly astringent when I tasted it. Moreover, Lion\u2019s Head, also known as Four Happiness Meatballs, is made by precisely kneading seventy percent of the lean meat and thirty percent of fatty meat into a meatball. In addition, the lean meat must be manually minced into fine bits and the fatty meat must not be too greasy. From the fact that the shredded meat are still sticking together, you can tell that the lean meat used in this dish was clearly not minced into fine bits. The fatty meat used is also too greasy, which affects the taste. I give a poor rating.\u201dBu Fang lightly exhaled and simply said. As Xiao Xiaolong and the others speechlessly stared at him, he spoke a lot of words and criticized the dish of Red Braised Lion\u2019s Head to the point where it sounded completely worthless.Xiao Xiaolong was flabbergasted as his chopsticks fell from his hands and onto the table. After hearing Bu Fang\u2019s assessment, the Lion\u2019s Head did not seem as delicious when he took another look at it. He had no idea that the meatballs had that many flaws.He originally still had some appetite, but now, his desire to continue eating disappeared. He spat out the half-eaten Lion\u2019s Head back into his bowl.\u201cOwner Bu\u2026 He really is here to cause trouble. The general area\u2019s signature dish was actually criticized to such a miserable state. However, with his culinary skills, the rating should be quite accurate,\u201d Xiao Xiaolong thought.The second dish, a plate of Steamed Fish, was served. A fresh aroma was continuously exuding from the fish, along with a warm steam.The appearance of the Steamed Fish was extremely well preserved. There were a few cuts made on the body of the fish. As the flesh of the fish became cooked after steaming, these cuts would be forced open and reveal the tender flesh inside. A light colored fish soup was resting within the plate and surrounding the Steamed Fish.This time, none of the others touched their chopsticks. They were staring at Bu Fang as they waited for him to give a rating first.Bu Fang nodded and picked up his chopsticks. He first used his chopsticks to lightly press down on the gills of the fish. A slight rebound force came from his chopsticks, causing Bu Fang to nod. He thought, \u201cIt looks like the control over the heat when cooking this Steamed Fish was done pretty well.\u201dHe dipped the tip of his chopsticks into the fish soup and placed it into his mouth. There was a faint trace of salty fishiness, but just this little bit of fishiness caused Bu Fang\u2019s expression to instantly become unpleasant.\u201cPtui!\u201d Bu Fang lightly spat while facing away from the table, then drank a mouthful of water to wash away the fishiness in his mouth.\u201cEven the basic fishiness of the fish was not removed. There\u2019s no point in trying, the flesh of the fish definitely contains fishiness.\u201d Bu Fang\u2019s expression was extremely unpleasant and his tone was even slightly cold as he gave his assessment.Xiao Xiaolong and the others were surprised once more. Bu Fang had already judged the dish as a failure before he even tasted the fish\u2026 Xiao Xiaolong did not blindly believe him and used his chopsticks to put a piece of fish into his mouth.The taste was actually still pretty good. The fishiness that Bu Fang mentioned was present but not that strong. Even though it was still there, it was still tolerable.\u201cCulinary is particular about rigorousness. Any oversight or mistake will affect the taste of the food! Fishiness should not be present in the first place. Since it\u2019s present, then it\u2019s a failure,\u201d Bu Fang mercilessly criticized.Xiao Xiaolong and the others nodded without fully understanding his words. A few moments later, the waiter was serving a few other dishes. However, when he saw the mostly intact dishes on the table, he was slightly startled.Some of the dishes were almost untouched while some were only slightly disturbed. However, as a whole, the dishes on the customer\u2019s table were only tasted once and left unfinished.This was something completely unbelievable at the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant. The food cooked by the chefs of the restaurant had subdued the stomachs on innumerous people!As the waiter was bringing out the last dish for Bu Fang\u2019s table, he informed elder sister Chun about the weird situation at the table and she was startled as well. She had a doubtful expression as she carried the final dish to Bu Fang\u2019s table.When Elder sister Chun arrived at the table and saw the table filled with practically untouched dishes, her pupils slightly constricted as she asked, \u201cOh my, young master Xiao, why aren\u2019t you eating? Are the dishes not to your liking?\u201dBu Fang\u2019s mood was currently not good. The fact that he was unable to taste a good dish was naturally affecting his mood as well.Xiao Xiaolong helplessly pointed at Bu Fang and said, \u201cThis young master Bu said that your dishes were cooked\u2026 too poorly, that they\u2019re completely inedible.\u201d\u201cWhat? Young master Xiao must be joking. Everyone in the imperial city knows how well the dishes from Immortal Phoenix Restaurant tastes like. Even though this is the general area, even the dishes here are comparable to the signature dishes of other big restaurants!\u201d Elder sister Chun chuckled and waved her hand.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHer gaze landed on Bu Fang and her expression became unpleasant.Bu Fang ignored her and used his chopsticks to eat the final dish.After having a single bite, Bu Fang put down his chopsticks. He shook his head and simply said, \u201cFor this Stir-Fried Shrimps with Bamboo Shoot, the bamboo shoots chosen are overripe, and some of them are too bitter and difficult to chew. There\u2019s a difference in quality in the shrimps used as well. Some of them are live prawns while the others are dead prawns. The difference between the taste is too strong. I give a poor rating.\u201dAfter hearing Bu Fang\u2019s assessment, elder sister Chun went into a daze. Then, she was so exasperated that her chest began to heave. She thought, \u201cThis zombie face is really here to cause trouble! He actually dares to criticize the signature dish of the general area as worthless! Who is he to evaluate us like this?!\u201dElder sister Chun massaged her bulging chest and coldly glanced at Bu Fang, saying, \u201cLooks like you\u2019re a chef as well? Since you\u2019re a chef, you should understand\u2026 Who are you to evaluate the dishes of Immortal Phoenix Restaurant!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Xiao Xiaolong\u2019s friend was clearly there to find fault. The general area\u2019s dishes might not be cooked by their top chef, but it was not possible for them to be as dreadful as he described.Meanwhile, Xiao Xiaolong and the others were looking at elder sister Chun with weird expressions on their faces. They thought, \u201cBu Fang does not have the qualifications to criticize Immortal Phoenix Restaurant\u2019s dishes? That\u2019s the biggest joke in the world. Even the emperor was subdued by Bu Fang\u2019s dishes, what right does the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant have to be so arrogant?\u201dElder sister Chun\u2019s words were very arrogant, but she had the qualification to be arrogant. She was very confident in the chefs of the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant. There was basically no other restaurant in the Light Wind Empire that was better than them. The chefs they hired were the best in the entire empire.The mocking gaze from Xiao Xiaolong and the others was making elder sister Chun feel slightly uncomfortable. Her pretty face slightly frowned as she asked, \u201cAre my words incorrect?\u201dXiao Xiaolong and the others chuckled and lightly shook their heads without speaking, while Bu Fang was expressionless as he glanced at her.His glance was as if he was looking at a clown.Bu Fang stood up and glanced at elder sister Chun. He placed some gold coins on the table and simply said, \u201cBring me to the second floor. All of the dishes on the first floor\u2026 I give a poor rating.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Elder sister Chun was exasperated. She thought, \u201cWhy is this person so arrogant! Who does he think he is? Who is he to criticize the dishes made by the chefs of Immortal Phoenix Restaurant?!\u201dWhen Xiao Xiaolong and the others saw that Bu Fang was going to the second floor, their eyes immediately lit up and they stood up as well.Xiao Xiaolong smiled as he moved next to elder sister Chun and said, \u201cElder sister Chun, don\u2019t be angry. This friend of mine has a personality just like that. Bring us to the second floor. The second floor\u2019s dishes are incomparable to the first floor\u2019s. When that time comes, my friend might not give such an assessment.\u201d\u201cFine! I want to see whether this arrogant brat would still be this conceited upstairs!\u201d Elder sister Chun tenderly snorted as she turned around and led the way while swaying her hips.Xiao Xiaolong and the others carefreely smiled as they followed after her.The space on the second floor of the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant was much narrower than the first floor. When Bu Fang and the others made their way onto the second floor, they could feel a different atmosphere with their bodies.Unlike the clamorous first floor, the second floor was extremely quiet and harmonious. The furnishing was very gorgeous and exquisite, and there were many spirit herbs placed in the surroundings that constantly released fresh air. There were some customers seated at their tables, eating their food in a refined manner.Elder sister Chun led them toward an empty table while swaying her body. Her expression was unpleasant as she coldly said to Bu Fang, \u201cLook at the menu, what do you want to eat!\u201dBu Fang received the menu. There were around twenty dishes written on it and every single dish was very expensive. Even though it was nothing compared to Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store, the price was already unattainable for the ordinary populace.Bu Fang only took a single glance before he placed the menu on the table and simply said, \u201cGive me all of the dishes that you think are the best on the second floor.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d Elder sister Chun\u2019s pupils constricted as she coldly looked at Bu Fang. She thought, \u201cFrom his tone, this brat is still trying to find fault with our dishes? He\u2019s on the second floor of the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant and he still dares to find fault?\u201d\u201cVery well! I\u2019ll let you experience the dishes of the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant!\u201d Elder sister Chun angrily snorted as she turned around and left to make arrangements for the preparation of the dishes.Only after elder sister Chun left, Xiao Xiaolong softly asked Bu Fang, \u201cOwner Bu\u2026 Are you really preparing to criticize all of the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant\u2019s dishes today?\u201cIs this really a wise thing to do? After all, harmony breeds prosperity.\u201dBu Fang slightly frowned and glanced at Xiao Xiaolong. He simply said, \u201cThey should be grateful that I am pointing out their inadequacies.\u201dOuyang Xiaoyi could not help but burst out laughing. Owner Bu\u2019s earnest appearance while speaking nonsense was simply too funny for her.Xiao Yanyu was covering her mouth as she chuckled as well. A trace of captivating redness appeared on her beautiful face.On the other hand, Bu Fang was extremely puzzled. He was speaking the truth. The assessment he gave pointed out the fatal flaws of the dishes. If they made revisions based on these flaws, the taste of these dishes would at least improve by a single grade.After a while, the fragrance of a dish drifted toward them.Elder sister Chun\u2019s hips were swaying as she leisurely approached while bringing the dish. She was carrying a large plate with flower crabs that exuded a rich fragrance. These flower crabs were split into halves and erected on the plate. From a distance, it looked dazzling and glorious.\u201cThis is a very well-known dish of the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant\u2019s distinguished area, the Pan-Fried Flower Crab.\u201d Elder sister Chun provocatively looked at Bu Fang after placing the dish onto the table.Xiao Xiaolong was feeling slightly unable to restrain himself as he breathed in the aroma of the flower crab. Previously, when he came to the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant, he would definitely order this dish.He moved one of the flower crabs into his bowl and eagerly removed the shell before he heartily started eating.Bu Fang also helped himself to one half of a flower crab. The color of the flower crab was well-controlled. The red-colored shell and also the fragrance that exuded after it was pan-fried were quite tantalizing.Grabbing a single chopstick, Bu Fang pried open the shell of the flower crab and the fragrant crab meat was exposed in front of him. That white and tender crab meat was giving off a faint heat, and when supplemented by the red shell, made it even more inviting.Bu Fang did not immediately touch the crab meat. He used his chopstick to scoop off some of the crab butter from the shell. The crab butter was amber in color and very enticing. Even though the fragrance was not that strong, it was still the essence of a crab.\u201cHmm?\u201d After Bu Fang tasted the crab butter that remained on the shell, he began to frown and did not say anything. Then, he took a bite of the tender and fragrant crab meat and his expression was still solemn.After tasting both the crab butter and crab meat, Bu Fang put the flower crab down and did not say anything.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Can\u2019t point out any flaws? The dishes on the first floor are prepared for ordinary commoners and you would definitely be able to point out the flaws. However, now that you\u2019re on the second floor, the dishes here are prepared for the distinguished guests, the prestigious people within the imperial city. Can you still point out the flaws?\u201dWhen elder sister Chun saw that Bu Fang was not speaking, she immediately began to mock and ridicule him.Xiao Xiaolong and the others were also startled as they puzzledly looked at Bu Fang. However, according to their understanding of Bu Fang, he would definitely not give up such a chance to put down others.Bu Fang glanced at the jubilant elder sister Chun, then pursed his lips and simply said, \u201cIt\u2019s not that I can\u2019t say anything, it\u2019s that I am speechless. Is this really a signature dish from the second floor of Immortal Phoenix Restaurant?\u201cLeaving aside how the flower crab was cooked, the choice of the flower crab itself was a stain on this dish. The most important aspect of Pan-Fried Flower Crab is the selection of the flower crab. This flower crab\u2019s meat is not tender enough and it\u2019s as tasteless as water. Just from looking, I can tell that this crab was artificially bred. The texture of the meat feels empty and the taste is much worse than wild flower crabs. Furthermore, there\u2019s also the problem with the pan-frying process. The control over the heat was not done properly and as a result, the crab butter lost its fragrance and taste due to overcooking. Overall, I give a poor rating.\u201dIt was not that Bu Fang could not say it, but he was lazy to say it. When he first smelled this dish of Pan-Fried Flower Crab, he was feeling slightly expectant. However, once he tasted it, that expectation sharply fell. Saying that it fell from the sky into an abyss would not be an exaggeration.Elder sister Chun went into a daze. Xiao Xiaolong and the others went into a daze as well. So\u2026 this dish had so many flaws! They could not tell at all!\u201cHmph! Who doesn\u2019t know how to talk nonsense! Who knows whether your comments are correct!\u201d Elder sister Chun started to sneer.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBu Fang indifferent glanced at her and looked away. \u201cIt\u2019s up to you whether you believe it or not. Hurry up and serve the other dishes. I\u2019ve already lost my patience with your dishes.\u201dThat was right, whether she believed or not did not matter to Bu Fang. He was only there to complete the system mission and not to educate elder sister Chun.\u201cElder sister Chun, what happened? What\u2019s the reason for the dispute?\u201dJust when elder sister Chun\u2019s chest was heaving from exasperation, a slim figure slowly approached and started to speak.When elder sister Chun saw the person who approached, her eyes lit up as she said, \u201cOwner Qian, hurry up and come over. This fellow is saying that our restaurant\u2019s dishes are not cooked properly!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It\u2019s been a while since you\u2019ve patronized our restaurant. Oh my, goddess Yanyu and princess Ouyang are here as well. Excuse me for not welcoming you earlier. Eh? This is\u2026\u201dQian Bao knew how to conduct himself, or in other words, he knew how to do business. He was excellent when dealing with people. In simpler terms, he was a sly person. Hence, he was able to build up a small restaurant from nothing into Immortal Phoenix Restaurant\u2019s current scale.Obviously, there were many people behind his success. However, Qian Bao\u2019s own effort and talent definitely played a part as well.\u201cYou can address him as young master Bu,\u201d Xiao Xiaolong smiled as he introduced Bu Fang. He did not dare to announce Bu Fang\u2019s name. The black-hearted restaurant was renowned within the imperial city recently and had already become the biggest competitor of the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant. If he chose to announce Bu Fang\u2019s name at that very moment, there was no guarantee that Qian Bao would not erase Bu Fang.\u201cYoung master Bu?\u201d Qian Bao thought as he tried to search his memories. However, he did not recall any notable families with the surname Bu.However, Qian Bao still smiled as he performed a fist and palm salute to Bu Fang and said, \u201cI see, you\u2019re actually young master Bu. I\u2019ve heard much about you. Are our dishes not to your liking?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that they\u2019re not to my liking. It\u2019s that they\u2019re badly cooked. I give a poor rating,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly said in a serious manner.\u201cThey\u2019re badly cooked?\u201d Qian Bao was slightly dumbfounded as he looked at Bu Fang\u2019s serious expression. It had been a while since he met someone that dared to find fault at the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant.When Immortal Phoenix Restaurant was first built, people from other restaurants would come over to find fault with their food. At that time, there were indeed flaws in their dishes. However, at the moment\u2026 As the restaurant expanded, they spent lots of money to hire chefs from all over Light Wind Empire and each of the chef had their own signature dish. This eventually created the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant\u2019s current reputation.\u201cYoung master Bu, you must be joking. You can ask anyone from within the imperial city. Who would dare to say that the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant\u2019s dishes are not delicious?\u201d Qian Bao said with a smile on his face. However, the words he said were filled with arrogance.\u201cIf it\u2019s not delicious, it\u2019s not delicious. These dishes were badly cooked. You can serve any dish and I can point out the flaws to you,\u201d Bu Fang simply said. He could not be bothered to argue with Qian Bao.Bu Fang\u2019s words caused Qian Bao to slightly narrow his eyes as he thought, \u201cThis brat is truly arrogant. He actually dared to speak such nonsense? Does he really have so much confidence?\u201d\u201cVery well! Since young master Bu insists, I\u2019ll serve up a dish and let the chef have a face to face confrontation. If you\u2019re able to convince my chef, I\u2019ll admit it,\u201d Qian Bao simply said as the smile disappeared from his face.\u201cAre they really going to have a face to face confrontation?\u201d Xiao Xiaolong and the others were startled for a moment and then they became extremely excited. Qian Bao might not know the identity of Bu Fang, but they knew him well. Since Bu Fang dared to say those words, then he would obviously be certain since Bu Fang\u2019s culinary skills were much stronger than the chefs from the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant.\u201cNo, I don\u2019t need your approval. How about this, let\u2019s have a wager. If the flaws that I point out can convince your chef, you\u2019ll let me go to the third floor. On the other hand, if I lose, I\u2019ll compensate with a hundred times the price of these dishes. How about it?\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly said.Everyone sucked in a breath of cold air. \u201cA hundred times the price as compensation, this Owner Bu is truly prosperous! With so many dishes, the total cost had already exceeded five hundred gold coins. With hundred times the price\u2026 that\u2019s at least fifty thousand gold coins!\u201dEven Qian Bao\u2019s heart skipped a beat when he heard the wager. His gaze when he looked at Bu Fang no longer contained any trace of belittlement.How could the identity of someone who dared to use fifty thousand gold coins as a wager be that simple? Furthermore, he was accompanied by Xiao Xiaolong, the son of a court official. Clearly, his background was not simple.Was the objective of the other party to enter the third floor of the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant? Was his desire to taste the dishes of the third floor? Could he be planning to find fault on the third floor?Within that instant, Qian Bao thought of many things. Finally, his eyes narrowed as he said, \u201cVery well! I agree!\u201dBu Fang nodded and signaled Qian Bao to choose any dish as he wished.Qian Bao placed his hands behind his back as he said, \u201cElder sister Chun, get someone to serve the signature dish of the second floor, the Dry-Fried Rock Carp!\u201dWhen elder sister Chun heard Qian Bao\u2019s words, her eyes immediately lit up. She thought, \u201cAs expected of the owner! With this dish, let\u2019s see whether this brat can still find any fault!\u201dThe Dry-Fried Rock Carp was the best dish within the second floor of the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant. It was originally supposed to be promoted to the third floor. However, since the owner decided that the third floor would only have three dishes, the Dry-Fried Rock Carp was eventually bumped off.However, be it the taste or the appearance, the Dry-Fried Rock Carp was qualified enough to enter the third floor!\u201cYoung master Bu, please have a seat and wait a moment,\u201d Qian Bao said while smiling. He beckoned Xiao Xiaolong and the others to sit down and wait for the dish to arrive.Bu Fang did not say anything as he sat down on his seat and quietly waited for the Dry-Fried Rock Carp that Qian Bao mentioned.Meanwhile, Qian Bao was happily chatting with Xiao Xiaolong and the others.After a while, they could smell a rich fragrance wafting in the air, causing many of the customers on the second floor to look around for the source.Elder sister Chun was approaching while carrying a large plate and a large amount of steam was rising from it. This time, she did not even dare to swing her voluptuous hips, fearing that she would spill the dish.An obese man wearing a chef\u2019s uniform was following behind elder sister Chun with a prideful expression.\u201cThe Dry-Fried Rock Carp is here, please enjoy your meal,\u201d elder sister Chun charmingly said as she bent and placed the dish onto the table.\u201cOwner Qian, I heard someone is here to find fault. I came over to see whether this fellow can point out any flaws regarding my dish!\u201d The obese man walked toward Qian Bao and loudly said.Bu Fang glanced at the obese man and that obese man turned to face him as if he felt something. The muscles on his face were quivering.\u201cAre you the brat that came here to find fault?\u201d The obese man\u2019s perception was quite accurate as he glared at Bu Fang and said.\u201cMaster Chen, this is young master Bu. Don\u2019t try to scare him,\u201d Qian Bao said while smiling.Bu Fang remained expressionless as he shifted his gaze away from the obese man and toward the Dry-Fried Rock Carp.The color was bright and eye-catching, with a mixture of gold and red. A layer of thick sauce which contained many ingredients was releasing a sweet aroma. The fish which underwent deep-frying was exuding a rich fragrance that aroused his appetite.Just based on the appearance alone, this dish was not bad.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBu Fang picked up his chopsticks, while everyone looked on, he dipped it within the sauce and then placed it into his mouth.Xiao Xiaolong and the others held their breath as they fixedly stared at Bu Fang. Master Chen and Qian Bao also swallowed their saliva as they looked at Bu Fang.After Bu Fang tasted the sauce, he picked up a piece of the fish and placed it into his mouth. After savoring it, he put down his chopsticks.From the beginning to the end, there was not even a slightest expression on Bu Fang\u2019s face. No one could figure out what he was thinking.Suddenly, the mood became heavy and everyone held their breath.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Xiao Xiaolong and the others were slightly unable to bear it any longer, while Qian Bao had already impatiently opened his mouth and inquired. His eyes were fixedly staring at Bu Fang.Master Chen folded his arms across his chest as he calmly looked on. This dish of Dry-Fried Rock Carp was his speciality. He had been cooking the dish for dozens of years and his familiarity with it had already reached a peak. Within his heart, it was already perfect.Bu Fang lightly breathed out as he lifted up the cup of water from the table and drank a mouthful. Only then did his gaze shifted toward the others.He indifferently opened his mouth and gave his assessment, \u201cCompared to those dishes previously that were filled with mistakes, this dish of Dry-Fried Rock Carp can be said to be one grade higher.\u201dBu Fang\u2019s words instantly caused everyone to relax and Xiao Xiaolong and the others were smiling as well.\u201cOwner Bu actually praised this dish. Looks like the taste of this dish should be pretty good. Then we should definitely give it a try.\u201dWhile thinking like this in his mind, Xiao Xiaolong immediately picked up a piece of fish with his chopsticks and put it into his mouth. The savory taste of fish suddenly erupted within his mouth. The faint spiciness that spread within his mouth caused his eyes to suddenly lit up.Xiao Xiaolong nodded and said with a smile, \u201cThis dish is indeed pretty good. It\u2019s much more delicious than the previous ones.\u201dWhen Qian Bao heard those words, his eyes immediately narrowed and he could not conceal the smile on his face. Since they were all praising this dish, from his point of view, he should have won.To be able to easily earn fifty thousand gold coins, Qian Bao\u2019s mood was feeling joyous and delighted.\u201cYoung master Bu, if that\u2019s the case, this time\u2026 it\u2019s my victory?\u201d Qian Bao said with a chuckle.However, Bu Fang\u2019s reaction caused his heart to skip a beat. Bu Fang strangely glanced at him and a faint smile appeared on his face.\u201cI was only praising the taste of this dish. Compared to the previous dishes, this dish is indeed not bad. However, it\u2019s only not bad, but the flaws are still present.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d Everyone was stunned by his words.Their gazes once again focused on Bu Fang. They did not expect such a sudden change of events from him.\u201cThere are three steps to the cooking process of this Dry-Fied Rock Carp, right? Firstly, place the processed rock carp into a wok of oil and deep-fry until the skin wrinkles. Secondly, stir-fry the other ingredients. Thirdly, place the deep-fried rock carp and the fried ingredients into the wok and dry-fry them together.\u201dBu Fang slowly said. Master Chen\u2019s pupils slightly constricted because Bu Fang\u2019s analysis were exactly the same as his own cooking steps!\u201cHmph! So what? Those are only the general steps. There are many meticulous processes in each step as well. Those are the important points when cooking this dish,\u201d Master Chen sneered as he confidently said.Bu Fang nodded and pointed toward the Dry-Fried Rock Carp and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right, then I shall point out your inadequacies from the details aspect. Firstly, when you\u2019re processing the rock carp, you made cuts on both sides of the fish. You made two cuts on each side, right? This is your first inadequacy. You should\u2019ve made the cuts based on the length and width of the fish. According to the length of this fish, making three cuts would be the best, with two short cuts and one long cut. This would allow the fish to completely absorb the flavor during the deep-fry and dry-fry process.\u201dMaster Chen frowned. He had always made two cuts regardless of the size of the rock carp. He was already used to it and had never thought whether three cuts would be better.\u201cAs for how deep the cuts should be, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any need for me to say it. Next would be the deep-frying period. Due to the problem with the cuts, the deep-frying process was longer which caused the fish to age. This resulted in the rock carp losing its tenderness\u2026 The stir-frying of the other ingredients wasn\u2019t bad since no skills were needed. Lastly, it\u2019s the problem with the dry-frying. The dry-frying time was short by a few breaths. The broth was not thick enough and the fish had not sufficiently absorbed the flavor.\u201dBu Fang simply said. However, his words had already caused Master Chen to be dumbfounded. At first, Master Chen was going to retort, but when he thought about Bu Fang\u2019s words, he realized that cooking in this manner might be better.Gulp.Master Chen swallowed his saliva. His chubby face was filled with sweat and his eyes were filled with incredulity. He thought, \u201cIs this fellow a monster? How could he analyze so much flaws with this dish just from tasting it?!\u201dXiao Xiaolong and the others were astounded as well. \u201cOwner Bu\u2026 How amazing! He only tasted it once and was able to cause the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant\u2019s chef to be speechless.\u201d\u201cMa\u2026 Master Chen\u2026 Is what he said correct?\u201d Qian Bao\u2019s current expression was already slightly unpleasant as he asked Master Chen who was having cold sweats.Elder sister Chun who was standing nearby was completely stunned. She did not think that this young master Bu was actually this powerful, that he could cause Master Chen to have cold sweats with a few words.\u201cOwner Qian\u2026 What young master Bu said is indeed correct. I\u2019ve been cooking Dry-Fried Rock Carp for dozens of years and I understand very well how each step would affect the taste\u2026 What young master Bu said were aspects that I\u2019ve never thought of all these years,\u201d Master Chen calmly accepted Bu Fang\u2019s advice as he sighed and said to Qian Bao.Qian Bao went into a daze. The fifty thousand gold coins\u2026 were suddenly gone!Bu Fang glanced at the stupefied Qian Bao, then stood up and expressionlessly walked away.\u201cXiaoyi, follow me. We\u2019re going to the third floor.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Eh? Wait for us!\u201d Xiao Xiaolong and the others were immediately awaken from their astonishment. They hurriedly followed after Bu Fang.Qian Bao had also recovered from his stupor and his expression was slightly unpleasant. He clenched his teeth and followed after Bu Fang as well.Qian Bao brought the four of them to the third floor. This was the most honorable floor of the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant and was ordinarily not opened to the public.\u201cYoung master Bu, please!\u201dQian Bao had become serious as well. The previous scene had already made known that Bu Fang was not speaking nonsense and was someone with capabilities.The surroundings of the third floor was indeed much better than the second floor. Just from entering, they could feel the dense amount of spirit energy drifting in the air. Qian Bao actually spent a huge amount of money to set up a magic formation that gathered spirit energy on the third floor!Xiao Xiaolong and the others were utterly speechless. They had never been to the third floor and were finally able to enter due to Bu Fang. They were instantly overwhelmed by the novelty.\u201cYoung master Bu, please have a seat. I\u2019ll get someone to serve the dishes! The third floor of the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant has only three dishes,\u201d Qian Bao said.Bu Fang nodded. He sat down at an eight-immortal table made from red sandalwood and quietly waited for the dishes to arrive.With a grave expression, Qian Bao left the third floor and went to instruct people to prepare the dishes.Xiao Xiaolong and the others were curiously looking around. When facing novelties, most people would be filled with curiosity.However, Bu Fang was sitting there without moving. His eyes were closed as he waited for the dishes to arrive.After approximately half an hour, Qian Bao returned. A servant girl with a voluptuous body was following behind him. She was wearing a dress which barely covered her beautiful legs.\u201cYoung master Bu, this is the supreme area\u2019s first dish, the Red Braised Spirit Pork.\u201dBu Fang nodded. His gaze fell on the large porcelain plate in front of them. There was a piece of scarlet and alluring pork placed on the plate, which was exuding a rich fragrance. The first impression he had was that it was fat but not greasy, and seemed exquisite and beautiful like a red jadeite.\u201cThis is the supreme area\u2019s second dish, Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Drunken Ribs!\u201dIt was another beautiful and voluptuous servant girl carrying a dish. She placed it in front of Bu Fang and removed the lid. The tangerine-colored Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Drunken Ribs was reflected in his eyes.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBu Fang raised his eyebrows. He looked at the dish with interest as the corner of his mouth widened into a smile. Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs?\u201cThe third dish, which is also our supreme dish, the Colored-Glass Roasted Flower Duck!\u201dWhen Qian Bao announced the last dish, his tone became much more confident and he became extremely proud. He was subconsciously revealing his confidence in this last dish.Bu Fang narrowed his eyes as he looked at the self-confident duck with a body that seemed like colored-glass as it loftily stood on the plate. Its wing were slightly spread apart, as if it was going to flap them and fly away, while its neck was curled into a S-shape.Bu Fang blinked and he could not help but feel puzzled\u2026 \u201cIs, is this really a Roasted Flower Duck? Is this really not a roasted duck that wishes to ascend?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That\u2019s because up till now, this supreme area has only admitted the court ministers, His Majesty as well as the prince. I\u2019ve only allowed young master to enter due to your ability to assess dishes. Otherwise, even if you had acted shamelessly, I would never allow you to enter the third floor.\u201dQian Bao said in a serious manner. He regarded the supreme area as important, which is why he acted prudently.If the general area and the distinguished guest area were the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant\u2019s basis for establishing itself within the imperial city, then the supreme area on the third floor would be the basis of its reputation.Qian Bao was only solemnly regarding Bu Fang since he was able to easily list out the flaws within the cooking process of the Dry-Fried Rock Carp that even Master Chen could not detect.Bu Fang\u2019s assessment of the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant\u2019s dishes as he made his way to the third floor could be considered a huge insult to their reputation. Qian Bao could not let this humiliation live down. He must find a way to save his reputation and the only way was the third floor.Bu Fang glanced at Qian Bao and expressionlessly said, \u201cIf someone wishes for me to evaluate their dishes, I might not be in the mood to care about it. If it wasn\u2019t for special circumstances, I really can\u2019t be bothered to taste your garbage dishes.\u201dBu Fang\u2019s tone was extremely indifferent. Even though his words sounded like ridicule, there was no intention to ridicule in the slightest. It was as if he was stating the truth.Qian Bao suddenly froze for a moment and he was speechless. However, his narrowed eyes as he suddenly laughed and said, \u201cThen would young master Bu please taste these three dishes?\u201cThese are the top three dishes of the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant.\u201dXiao Xiaolong and the others were blinking as they yearningly looked at the three dishes that had alluring appearances.The dishes from the supreme area of the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant were not something they could normally see. Even though these dishes might not be as delicious as the food in Bu Fang\u2019s store, eating at the third floor was not about enjoying the taste of the food. It was about enjoying the identity and status.Firstly, Bu Fang tasted the first dish, the Red Braised Spirit Pork. This was a dish made using an ingredient from a spirit beast, although it was only the low-end meat from the first grade spirit beast, Battle Boar. However, the chef\u2019s skills were pretty good and the meat was succulent after cooking. It was comparable to the Dry-Fried Rock Carp.However\u2026\u201cSince this is the meat from a spirit beast, then the choice of the ingredient should be very prudent. For this dish, choosing the meat from the Battle Boar is the wrong choice. The meat from the Battle Boar is more suited for making stews, while the meat from the Flame Boar is the best choice for braising. Also, the control over the heat during the braising process is still lacking and the braising liquid is\u2026 too sweet.\u201dAfter having a bite of the dish, Bu Fang expressionlessly put down his chopsticks and mercilessly gave his assessment. Suddenly, several flaws of this first-rate cuisine were pointed out by Bu Fang.Qian Bao was dumbfounded. He hurriedly ordered the servant girl to record down the flaws mentioned by Bu Fang.Qian Bao was not too surprised that Bu Fang was able to find so many flaws within the Red Braised Spirit Pork. After all, the level of this dish was almost the same as the Dry-Fried Rock Carp.\u201cYoung master Bu, try this dish as well, Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Drunken Ribs,\u201d Qian Bao said.However, the result was beyond his expectations. Bu Fang\u2019s assessment of this dish was extremely low and the flaws he found were even more numerous than in the Red Braised Spirit Pork.Qian Bao was stunned. He thought, \u201cWhy? Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Drunken Ribs is definitely slightly more delicious than Red Braised Spirit Pork\u2026\u201dXiao Xiaolong and the others were stifling their smiles. Showing off Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs in front of Owner Bu, it was like he was asking for a scolding. From their point of view, Bu Fang\u2019s Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs was unsurpassable.Bu Fang ignored Qian Bao as his gaze shifted toward the Roasted Flower Duck that seemed to wish for ascension.\u201cThis food presentation\u2026 is slightly interesting.\u201d The corner of Bu Fang\u2019s mouth twitched as he used his chopsticks to poke the duck\u2019s body. A slight rebound force was transmitted to his hands through the chopsticks.\u201cClap clap!\u201d When Qian Bao saw that Bu Fang was about to try the signature dish, Roasted Flower Duck, he suddenly and energetically clapped his hands.Then, that voluptuous servant girl who was wearing the dress that revealed her legs gracefully walked next to Bu Fang. A burst of fragrance exuded from her body.Bu Fang frowned as he indifferently said, \u201cDon\u2019t get so close to me. The fragrance coming from you is affecting my judgement toward this dish.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d That servant was startled and her pretty face was filled with confusion. Her hand that was holding the dagger stopped in mid-air and she seemed a little helpless.Qian Bao was stunned for a moment and then started to frown. He employed these beautiful servant girls for the sake of attending to those high officials and dignitaries. He even specially spent huge amount of money to buy high grade cosmetic products for these servants girls to become even more lively and charming. He did not think that his methods would negatively affect the customers\u2019 appetite instead.He pondered for a moment and then let the servant girl withdraw. Then he personally held the dagger and began to handle the duck.Qian Bao evidently had some knowledge of handling this dish. His hands were steady as he quickly sliced off a portion of the meat and served it to Bu Fang.Bu Fang wrapped the meat within a spring roll wrapper with some cabbage and added a little vinegar. Then, he swallowed the entire thing.The taste of the duck meat and the cabbage when mixed together was just perfect and created an indescribable texture. When added with the chewiness of the spring roll wrapper, Bu Fang experienced an ineffably delicious taste.He had to admit that the taste of the Roasted Flower Duck was extremely good.\u201cYoung master Bu, how is the taste of the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant\u2019s signature dish?\u201d Qian Bao licked his lips as he intensely stared at Bu Fang. He was confident that this dish that the emperor praised as the number one duck within the Light Wind Empire would be able to subdue this fellow.\u201cHmm, this dish is indeed pretty good,\u201d Bu Fang once again sliced off another piece of duck meat. This time, he did not wrap it with the spring roll wrapper and directly ate it.He was someone that enjoyed delicious food as well. Every single chef was an authentic glutton.\u201cThen, young master Bu\u2026 Could you point out any flaws within this dish?\u201d Qian Bao took a deep breath and said, as he closely stared at Bu Fang.Bu Fang leisurely drank a mouthful of water and simply said, \u201cThis dish can be said to be the most perfect dish within the entire Immortal Phoenix Restaurant. The taste is very good.\u201cI can guess, this dish is made by strictly following the steps of a recipe. Not a single character was missed and every single detail was taken note,\u201d Bu Fang said.Qian Bao\u2019s pupils suddenly constricted as he stood up. He was intensely staring at Bu Fang and the deepest parts of his eyes were filled with incredulity.Indeed! This dish of Colored-glass Roasted Flower Duck was from a recipe that he obtained by chance. It was because of this recipe that he could operate the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant to its current state and obtain the support of that distinguished person.\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong by following the steps of the recipe. However, as you\u2019re too rigid and lacked a certain flexibility, you overlooked a few important points. You need to understand that every single recipe underwent numerous revisions and attempts before they were recorded. They are not perfect and there\u2019s still room for improvement as well. Just like this dish, a mistake appeared in the choice of ingredients.\u201d\u201cThe choice of ingredients?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, the recipe stated that mature ducks should be used, correct? Furthermore, it should be high quality spirit ducks. However, choosing young ducks is actually better. The skin of the mature ducks is too tight and the flesh is too tough. As for the other flaws, they\u2019re not important so I won\u2019t mention them,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly said.Qian Bao took a deep breath and calmed himself down. However, his complexion was not very pleasant.He did not agree with Bu Fang\u2019s statement. \u201cYoung master Bu, this dish of Roasted Flower Duck, as the signature dish of our restaurant, has already gone through numerous trials. I do not agree with your argument of cooking with young ducks. I believe even more in the method recorded in the recipe.\u201dEven though Bu Fang\u2019s words sounded reasonable, Qian Bao would not easily believe him. After all, it was the signature dish, so how could he lightly make amendments?Bu Fang indifferently glanced at him and said, \u201cWhether you believe it or not has nothing to do with me. I was only assessing the dish. Alright, I\u2019ve already assessed all of the dishes. Then, I shall take my leave. This is for my bill.\u201dBu Fang stood up and placed five crystals on the table. Then, he elegantly headed down the stairs.Qian Bao\u2019s expression was sullen as he stood on the spot. As he looked at the three dishes on the table that were basically untouched, the emotions in his eyes were wavering.\u201cYoung master Bu\u2026 Who exactly are you!\u201d Qian Bao took a deep breath and muttered to himself. Then his gaze shifted toward Xiao Xiaolong who was just about to leave.\u201cYoung master Xiao, could you tell me the identity of young master Bu\u2026 Someone who could point out the flaws of a dish in such a detailed manner is definitely not an ordinary person. Is he an imperial chef from the imperial kitchen?\u201d Qian Bao asked as he performed a fist and palm salute.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euXiao Xiaolong was stunned for a moment and a mischievous smile suddenly appeared on his face. He narrowed his eyes and said, \u201cIsn\u2019t Owner Bu really awesome? Not only are his culinary skills high, his ability to assess dishes is first-rate as well. I was truly impressed.\u201d\u201cOwner Bu?!\u201d Qian Bao knitted his eyebrows together. Then he narrowed his eyes as he sucked in his breath and said, \u201cIs this person\u2026 the owner of the black-hearted store?\u201dXiao Xiaolong mysteriously smiled and did not reply. He turned around and followed after Bu Fang\u2019s back figure.At that moment, Bu Fang was slowly walking with his hands behind his back. The system\u2019s solemn voice was resounding within his mind.\u201cCongratulations to the host for completing the abrupt mission: taste the thirteen dishes of the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant and find out their inadequacies. The mission reward will now be released.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The moment he stepped out of the warm interior of the building, the cold air rushed into his face, causing his entire body to shudder. He could not help but cross his arms across his chest as he walked.However, even though the temperature was very low, Bu Fang was feeling abnormally fervent. The reason was the system just announced in his mind that he succeeded his mission and he was about to receive the mission reward.Ten percent of true energy cultivation progression, and the advanced cooking method of a dish from Immortal Phoenix Restaurant were very generous rewards. Bu Fang was obviously feeling overjoyed.Xiao Xiaolong and the others had caught up with him and were walking next to him. Ouyang Xiaoyi and Xiao Xiaolong were chatting nonstop and continuously praising Bu Fang\u2019s mystical and wondrous ability to render the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant\u2019s chef speechless just by tasting the dish once.Xiao Yanyu had once again put on her veil and concealed her peerless beauty. She seemed calm and elegant as she quietly walked along with them.The four of them bid farewell as they reached the entrance of the alleyway. Xiao Xiaolong and the others went back home while Bu Fang stepped into the alleyway and returned to his store.At the entrance of the store, Blacky was fast asleep on its belly. Even though Bu Fang returned, he was still soundly asleep.\u201cThe mission reward has been released. Ten percent of true energy cultivation progression has been obtained. The system will now randomly draw from the dishes that were assessed.\u201d The system\u2019s solemn voice rang out in Bu Fang\u2019s mind.Bu Fang was slightly startled. His eyes narrowed as his mind settled down. He was suddenly curious about which dish he would draw.Obviously, the dish he least wanted was the Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Drunken Ribs since he already had Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs on his store\u2019s menu.Within his mind, the names of various dishes rapidly flashed by and continuously changed. This was the system performing a random drawing\u2026At last, the changing of the dishes gradually became slower and then stopped. Finally, it was reflected clearly within Bu Fang\u2019s mind.\u201cThe dish, Pan-Fried Flower Crab, has been drawn. After advancement, it is now Pan-Fried Tyrant Flower Crab.\u201dBu Fang could not help but recall the alluring and fragrant Pan-Fried Flower Crab and started to drool. Compared to drawing the Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Drunken Ribs, the Pan-Fried Flower Crab was already considered pretty good.Since a wooden board was hung at the entrance informing customers that business was suspended for that day, many customers excitedly arrived only to dejectedly depart. For example, Fatty Jin and his buddies waited for a while and only resentfully left after realizing that the store was really not opening for business.The other customers also experienced the same situation.After Bu Fang returned to the store, he did not plan to open for business as it was getting late. After a quick change of clothes, he stepped into the kitchen and was ready to start learning the new dish, Pan-Fried Tyrant Flower Crab.\u2026Immortal Phoenix Restaurant.Qian Bao was sitting upright on a chair with one hand holding his chin while frowning. He seemed to be thinking about something.\u201cYoung master Bu is actually the owner of the black-hearted store? He actually came to Immortal Phoenix Restaurant and criticized all of our dishes. Who does he think he is? How dare he look down on us!\u201d Qian Bao clenched his fist and furrowed his eyebrows in fury.Suddenly, he unclenched his fists and sighed. \u201cHowever, even so\u2026 This Owner Bu\u2019s level is high indeed. To be able to analyze a dish just by tasting it once, how terrifying!\u201dHe originally planned to have the chefs on his side challenge Bu Fang\u2019s store. However, from the looks of it, it was fortunate that they had not gone yet. Otherwise, their reputation would have gone down the drain. It was evident that there was a marginal difference in ability between Bu Fang and the chefs of the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant.However, Qian Bao could not resign himself to let things live down like this. Swallowing his own anger was not his way of handling affairs.Wait a moment! Qian Bao\u2019s eyes suddenly lit up as if he thought of something.\u201cI can let the chefs compete with him in cutting techniques! Without putting in a certain amount of time, it\u2019s impossible for anyone to master it! Even though we can\u2019t compete with Owner Bu when it comes to cooking methods, we can still defeat him with skills that require time to master!\u201dQian Bao excitedly banged the table as a smile appeared on his face and finally laughed out loud. Then, he ordered his subordinates to gather all of the chefs. He needed to pick the chef that was most skillful with knives.Qian Bao had already witnessed Bu Fang\u2019s understanding of dishes and cooking methods, so he could only proceed from the cutting techniques aspect.While Qian Bao was busy assembling his chefs and preparing to pick out the chef most proficient in cutting techniques, a Blood Phoenix Chicken was already secretly delivered to the crown prince\u2019s palace.Within the majestic palace of the crown prince, Ji Chengan was standing with his hands behind his back. He was curiously looking at the metallic cage made from fine iron in front of him. Within the cage, a lustrous chicken, that was entirely blood red in color, was imprisoned.\u201cIs this the fifth grade spirit beast, Blood Phoenix Chicken? The appearance is peculiar indeed,\u201d Ji Chengan nodded and said as the corner of his mouth curled up.Xushi was respectfully standing at a distance as he said, \u201cThe Blood Phoenix Chicken is a fifth grade spirit beast with a fast movement speed. Even though its combat ability is very weak among the fifth grade spirit beasts, it\u2019s still comparable to a fourth grade Battle-Spirit. It took them some time to capture it.\u201d\u201cYou did well, Xushi,\u201d the crown prince emotionally said as he turned around and looked toward Xushi.Xushi bowed once more and did not say anything else.\u201cThe Blood Phoenix Chicken and the Sage Herb are all prepared. Even the valuable medicinal ingredients are mostly gathered. Now, we only need to have Owner Bu cook the Elixir Cuisine. If this Elixir Cuisine can improve father\u2019s health, then my position as the emperor\u2026 will be settled.\u201d The crown prince stood with his hands held behind his back as he excitedly looked toward the Great Hall at a distance with many thoughts going through his mind.For the sake of becoming the emperor, he invested far too much. Every single step was like walking on thin ice. That was because he was afraid that if he took the wrong step, his beloved younger brother would obtain a ruinous weakness that would completely destroy him.\u201cXushi, make preparations. I will personally head to Owner Bu\u2019s store tomorrow. We must ensure the Elixir Cuisine is produced.\u201d The crown prince solemnly said, \u201cBefore we succeed, information about this Elixir Cuisine must be kept a secret. Do not let King Yu\u2019s subordinates find out about this.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness!\u201d Xushi respectfully said.King Yu\u2019s manor.Within a secret chamber, King Yu, Ji Chengyu, opened his eyes and turbid energy was expelled from his mouth. The true energy outside of his body was seething like boiling water. After a long while, it began to calm down and drew back within his body.\u201cSixth grade Battle-Emperor is truly difficult to reach. I\u2019ve been stuck at this bottleneck for over a year.\u201d King Yu heavily breathed out while feeling slightly helpless. However, he knew that he should not rush when it came to cultivation and he did not know of any solution either.The door to the cultivation chamber was opened. A figure enveloped within a black robe was standing at the entrance and a hoarse voice sounded out. \u201cYour Highness seems to be troubled over cultivating matters? Actually, Your Highness could use our Soul Sect\u2019s cultivation method. Advancing to sixth grade Battle-Emperor would not be an issue.\u201dKing Yu glanced at him and sneered. \u201cAfter that, I\u2019ll turn into a monster that doesn\u2019t resemble humans or ghosts like you? I am someone who is going to be the emperor. How could I have an ugly appearance like the likes of you?\u201dKing Yu\u2019s words were slightly sarcastic, but this was his usual style of speaking. The head elder of Soul Sect, Hun Qianyun, was not angry despite being on the receiving end and only eerily chuckled.Suddenly, a figure came from the door and handed over a secret letter to Ji Chengyu.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euJi Chengyu nodded and without making any attempts in concealment, he directly tore open the letter and started reading from it. As he read the letter, his expression became somewhat grave.\u201cThis brother of mine has truly been working hard for the sake of becoming emperor. Even this sort of method was employed. Everyone is well aware of father\u2019s health. There\u2019s simply no possibility of a cure at this point. He\u2019s actually placing his hope on a little store\u2019s Elixir Cuisine? How laughable.\u201dAs a burst of energy gushed out from King Yu\u2019s palm, the letter was immediately set on fire. Finally, it turned into ashes and drifted away.His eyes were extremely cold as he spoke with a trace of coldness in his voice, \u201cHun Qianyun, it is time for you to show your capabilities. Since my elder brother wishes to prolong father\u2019s life\u2026 then I shall stop him. Tonight, bring your men to that Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store and kill the owner. Remember, it must be a silent assassination. After all, that store is extraordinary according to the rumors.\u201dHun Qianyun began to laugh with his hoarse voice. \u201cWhen it comes to assassination\u2026 if the Soul Sect claims to be in the second place, no one in the world would dare to claim first place.

It gave others an eerie feeling, as if they were facing a wraith that escaped from hell.\u201cDo you not realize that King Yu is testing us? Even though King Yu has joined forces with us, he\u2019s still someone that belongs to the imperial court after all while we\u2019re from the sects. Our relationship is originally like that of fire and water. If King Yu wasn\u2019t aiming for the throne, he wouldn\u2019t dare to violate the taboo and cooperate with us,\u201d Hun Qianyun simply said. Every time he spoke, the spirit fire in his pupils would throb once.\u201cHumans, for the sake of benefits, will always take a risk. No matter what sort of identity you have, this will always be the case.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 what does head elder intend to do?\u201d the two members of the Soul Sect puzzledly asked.\u201cA few days ago, Hun Qianduan and the Sword Monarch escaped to that store. They relied on the protection of the store to obstruct the pursuit of Xiao Meng and Lian Fu. That mysterious store\u2019s strength is absolutely unimaginable for us. According to the rumors, there\u2019s a ninth grade supreme beast watching over the store. King Yu\u2019s objective is for us to sound out the actual situation. If we can succeed in killing him\u2026 that would be best,\u201d Hun Qianyun slowly said.\u201cHowever, even two seven grade Battle-Saints like Xiao Meng and Lian Fu were intercepted. If mere Battle-Emperors like you two were to go, it would be akin to committing suicide\u2026\u201dThe pupils of the two Soul Sect members immediately constricted as they felt a chill suddenly rise up from the bottom of their feet.\u201cLet Ah Long and Ah Hu go. They\u2019re both fifth grade Battle-Kings. If they rely on our techniques, they might be able to succeed in the assassination. Even if they fail\u2026 we\u2019ll only lose two Battle-Kings,\u201d Hun Qianyun said as he turned around.\u2026As the night descended, the early winter night brought a nip in the air. Gray clouds were quietly moving under the influence of the wind in the skies, concealing the two crescent moons that were calling out to each other.Within Fang Fang\u2019s Little store, Bu Fang had already changed into a comfortable set of clothing. His long hair was tied up with a woolen rope and his forehead was free of any bangs.\u201cThe Pan-Fried Tyrant Flower Crab is a dish that tests the quality of the ingredients and the control over the heat during the pan-fry process,\u201d Bu Fang muttered as he entered the kitchen. At the moment, he was planning to practice the dish that was randomly drawn, the Pan-Fried Tyrant Flower Crab.The flower crab, also known as portunus pelagicus, was a type of sea crab. It was known as flower crab due to the white spots on its shell. The meat of the flower crab was both tender and rich in nutrients.Of course\u2026 This was true regarding an ordinary flower crab.Based on Bu Fang\u2019s understanding of the system, the Tyrant Flower Crab would definitely not be an ordinary flower crab. It would definitely be a spirit beast.When he entered the kitchen, there was a large water tank on the floor. There was no water within the tank, but a gigantic flower crab with its claws and legs tied up was placed inside.This flower crab was beautiful. Its shell was fiery red in color while densely covered in crimson patterns, forming a dazzling picture.\u201cThe Tyrant Flower Crab is a fifth grade spirit beast from the sea region of the Wildlands. Its attack power is extremely strong and its fighting ability is terrifying. It usually lives in a group and is one of the scariest groups in the sea region of the Wildlands. However, its meat is delicious and is an extremely good ingredient,\u201d The system solemnly introduced the Tyrant Flower Crab\u2019s information to Bu Fang.Bu Fang narrowed his eyes. He already knew that the Tyrant Flower Crab would definitely not be an ordinary sea crab. The objective of the system was cooking fine food. The ingredients provided would definitely be first-rate.Bu Fang expressionlessly grabbed a kitchen knife with a pointed end from above the table. The kitchen knife was glimmering with sharpness. As Bu Fang casually flicked his wrist, the kitchen knife began to twirl in his hand.The Tyrant Flower Crab, which was tied up with a woolen rope, was obediently lying within the water tank. It was hard to imagine that it was actually a fifth grade spirit beast.As Bu Fang flipped the Tyrant Flower Crab over, it was still cluelessly foaming at its mouth.Once the belly of the Tyrant Flower Crab was exposed, Bu Fang stabbed the uppermost part of the belly with the tip of the kitchen knife. Within that instant, the Tyrant Flower Crab suddenly began to struggle. Its eyes were whirling around endlessly while the foam produced from its mouth increased.After around half an hour, the Tyrant Flower Crab finally stopped struggling and the woolen rope used to tie its claws had also loosened. After prying open the abdomen shell and removing it, Bu Fang began to clean and process the Tyrant Flower Crab.Once everything was settled, Bu Fang took out a frying pan. He poured some oil into it and let the pan heat up first.Taking out the heavy kitchen knife which Bu Fang used everyday for his morning Meteor Cutting Technique practice, he removed the woolen rope that was used to bind the Tyrant Flower Crab.Once the temperature of the oil was hot enough, Bu Fang\u2019s eyes suddenly became sharp. The heavy kitchen knife was viciously swung and it immediately split the Tyrant Flower Crab into two. The cut made was extremely smooth.Bu Fang\u2019s hand speed was extremely fast. During the instant when the Tyrant Flower Crab was cut open, before the crab butter could flow out, he immediately moved the entire crab onto the frying pan.Tsss\u2026A rich fragrance instantly emerged from the frying pan. That was the reaction caused by the meeting between crab meat, crab butter, and hot oil.Next was the control over the heat. Regarding this, Bu Fang was already quite experienced. Even though the Tyrant Flower Crab was gigantic, it was not a problem for him.Soon, the Pan-Fried Tyrant Flower Crab was ready to be served.The Tyrant Flower Crab, which was split into two, was placed onto a plate and its exterior shell had assumed an even brighter shade of red. Due to the oil covering its surface, it was glittering underneath the illumination of the lighting.The smell of the crab butter was extremely fragrant after it was pan-fried. In addition with Bu Fang\u2019s ability over controlling the heat, the meat of the crab was white, fragrant, and tender. As it exuded billows of steam, it aroused one\u2019s appetite.Bu Fang licked his lips. After wiping off the water droplets on his hands, he sat down on a chair and began to heartily eat the Pan-Fried Tyrant Flower Crab.\u201cAs expected, this is a hundred times tastier than the Immortal Phoenix\u2019s Restaurant Pan-Fried Flower Crab. How can my culinary skills be so formidable?\u201d Bu Fang shamelessly thought as he ate.Half of the Tyrant Flower Crab was just nice for Bu Fang, so the other half was reclaimed into Whitey\u2019s stomach.After cleaning up, Bu Fang stretched his body and yawned. After eating for the entire day, he was feeling slightly exhausted and was going to have an early rest. Having enough sleep was extremely important for a young man aiming to become the God of Cooking.As the lights went out, everything returned into darkness and silence once more.Deep in the night, the sound of something moving through the air suddenly emanated from the entrance of the alleyway. The pitch-black figures were almost impossible to capture by the naked eye in the darkness.The movement of the two people were agile as they slowly advanced while sticking to the quartzite walls of the alleyway. They were practically not making any sound.Bu Fang\u2019s store was divided into two floors. The first floor was the business area, while on the second there were many rooms with windows and Bu Fang\u2019s room was among them. Bu Fang\u2019s room was very comfortable with a large open window. Every morning, the sunlight would be projected through the window and the room would be nicely warm.However, as it was in the middle of winter, Bu Fang locked the window to prevent the cold wind from entering.The two figures stealthily stuck close to a window, with both of them standing on each side. Their auras were completely concealed.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAt the entrance of the store, Blacky who was soundly asleep suddenly moved. It drowsily opened its doggy eyes and glanced upward.\u201cEh? What are these two fifth grade little rats doing here in the middle of the night? Their techniques are quite strange. Unfortunately, they\u2019ve run into this lord dog\u2026 However, it\u2019s just two fifth grade little rats. This lord dog can\u2019t be bothered to take care of them. Bark. I am so sleepy.\u201dBlacky snorted as it lowered its doggy head and continued sleeping.The eyes of the two Battle-Kings from the Soul Sect flashed as one of them placed his hand on the window and the window immediately opened.The two of them looked toward each other in surprise. They did not expect for things to be so easy. However, it was not the time for them to hesitate. The two of them agilely went through the window.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When it came to assassination, both of them were extremely experienced. Since they had even assassinated cabinet ministers from the imperial courts before, they did not attach any importance to the owner of a small restaurant. If their boss had not solemnly reminded them to be careful before they set off, they would not even bother to be this cautious as their assassination target was simply too weak.The position where Ah Long and Ah Hu were located was not Bu Fang\u2019s bedroom. The interior of the room was empty and spacious. There was no one in sight.Ah Long\u2019s eyes slightly narrowed as he pointed ahead. Their figures moved toward a door nearby. As the door was pushed open, there was unexpectedly no sound at all. Everything was quietly completed.The two of them walked out of the room and reached a corner. The left corner led downstairs. The flight of stairs was eerie and gloomy as if it could devour a person\u2019s mind, causing them to uncontrollably feel terrified.Ah Long swallowed his saliva and forced himself to look away. Their line of sight shifted toward a tightly closed door ahead of them.The two of them were overjoyed as they looked at each other. From within that room, they could hear stable breathing. From the looks of it, the owner of the store should be within that room.They lightly pushed against the door of the room, but it was clearly locked as the door did not even budge. Ah Long unhurriedly took out a slender wire from his pockets. The true energy within his body surged and a thin layer of true energy enveloped the surface of the metal wire.As he inserted the metal wire enveloped by true energy into the keyhole, the lump of true energy transformed and immediately filled the keyhole. He slightly turned the metal wire and the sound of a lock opening rang out\u2026 The door was opened.\u201cHmm? It\u2019s too easy?\u201d Ah Long was surprised once more. It did not feel as dangerous as their boss had described.The two of them pushed open the door and looked inside. Their eyebrows were knitted together as they could not see anything within the darkness. With no other choice, they intended to enter the room and immediately launch a killing move.However, the two of them suddenly felt a chill cover their entire bodies. The step they were about to take was frozen in place as well.That was a type of chill that extended from the bottom of their hearts and instantly enveloped their entire bodies, like the cold wind blowing from the Arctic Lands.Their eyes suddenly widened and their pupils constricted to the size of a pea. They did not dare to make even the slightest move.Two rays of red light suddenly appeared from behind them and locked onto their bodies.\u201cWh\u2026 Who\u2019s there?!\u201dAh Long\u2019s entire body began to tremble as he struggled to turn his head. As he looked behind, his eyes met with that ray of light\u2026Whitey\u2019s mechanical eyes were flashing red as its mechanicals arms directly grabbed their necks and effortlessly lifted them up.\u201cSensing the targets\u2019 killing intent toward the owner. Searching for a solution\u2026\u201cSolution has been selected and will be activated immediately.\u201cSolution: Extermination.\u201dRays of light burst out from Whitey\u2019s mechanical eyes, as if it was searching for some data. After determining the solution, Whitey\u2019s eyes suddenly turned into a deep purple.The mechanical arms immediately tightened its grip.Ah Long\u2019s face was filled with terror as he struggled to break free from the mechanical arms that were like steel pliers. They tried to manipulate the true energy within their body, but whenever it flowed into their hands, it would disperse before they could use it\u2026As Ah Long felt the grip around his neck getting tighter and tighter, his struggles were also becoming more intense as blood spilled from his mouth.Whitey faced their fearful gazes without the slightest concern. It was as cold as a death god that treats all living things with indifference, while its purple mechanical eyes seemed extremely demonic within the darkness.\u201cCrack!\u201dWith two crisp sounds, Ah Long and Ah Hu suddenly stopped struggling. Then, their bodies went limp and their heads hanged down. Dark red blood flowed from their mouths and dripped onto the floor, producing an eerie sound.Whitey indifferently turned around while carrying the two who went limp as it left Bu Fang\u2019s room.As the door closed, the blood stains on the floor suddenly disappeared\u2026Bu Fang sniffed the air as he drowsily lifted his hand and picked his nose. Then he smacked his lips and continued sleeping.Bang bang!Two corpses fell from the air and crashed into the quartzite floor of the alleyway. Blood was flowing out\u2026Blacky drowsily raised its head. When it saw the two corpses, it scrunched its nose and snorted. Then, it opened its doggy mouth and lightly exhaled. The two corpses were blown out of the alleyway by a sudden squall and flung onto the streets.After doing this, Blacky contentedly lay down once more and continued sleeping.\u2026Within King Yu\u2019s manor, a candle flame was slightly flickering.An aged and gaunt figure wrapped within a black robe was deeply staring at the flickering candle flame. His eye sockets were filled with two lumps of azure spirit fire.Suddenly, the spirit fire within Hun Qianyun\u2019s pupils became faint for a moment and the sound of something breaking rang out.A sigh came from his mouth. \u201cAs I thought\u2026 That store should not be provoked. Ah Long, Ah Hu\u2026 died just like that.\u201dTwo figures silently appeared in front of Hun Qianyun and respectfully saluted.\u201cAh Long and Ah Hu died. Go to the alleyway and retrieve their corpses\u2026 We failed the assassination this time. I\u2019ll go and seek forgiveness from King Yu.\u201d Hun Qianyun tottered out of the room with his back hunched over.The two Battle-Emperors of the Soul Sect were feeling bewildered. Before Ah Long and Ah Hu set off, they already solemnly reminded them to be careful. However, not much time has passed\u2026 The two were already dead?Two fifth grade Battle-Kings could not even struggle?The two of them looked each other in the eye and could feel the fear in the other\u2019s eyes.\u2026\u201cYour Highness, we failed the assassination this time,\u201d with his back hunched over, Hun Qianyun simply said to King Yu.King Yu was wearing a luxurious robe with his hair loose and a peaceful expression on his face. As he glanced at Hun Qianyun, the corner of his mouth widened into a smile.\u201cUnderstood, I\u2019ll give your subordinates a good burial. You may withdraw first,\u201d King Yu softly said.Hun Qianyun\u2019s spirit fire slightly jumped. He did not say anything as he turned around and left. There was not even the slightest bit of intimidating aura or energy coming from his body. He was like an ordinary elderly man with one foot in his grave.However, King Yu did not dare to underestimate him. Hun Qianyun was the number one expert within the Soul Sect. His cultivation level was profound and he was most specialized in the way of the souls. Reportedly, he had already entered the realm of a seventh grade Battle-Saint. However, there were others who said that he was only a peak-level sixth grade Battle-Emperor.As King Yu watched Hun Qianyun\u2019s figure disappear, his eyes were gradually filled with interest.\u201cThis old fox is truly ruthless. He actually used the lives of two Battle-Kings to display his sincerity. Very well\u2026 Then I shall trust you for the time being.\u201d King Yu looked demonically charming as the corners of his mouth curled up.\u201cFang Fang\u2019s Little Store\u2026 What kind of secrets is this store that suddenly appeared hiding?\u201dCompared to the Soul Sect, King Yu suddenly discovered that he was more curious about that store.A night peacefully passed.The next morning, Bu Fang woke up early as usual. He first went to the kitchen and began his daily cutting technique practice. He held a heavy kitchen knife as he rapidly chopped up radishes. After finishing his cutting technique practice, Bu Fang began to cook Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs. It was breakfast meant for Blacky who was sooner or later going to turn into a pig.Fatty Jin and his buddies majestically arrived with impatient expressions. As Bu Fang had suspended business the day before, they had to suffer from their craving for an entire day. After getting used to Bu Fang\u2019s dishes, the food from other restaurants were tasteless.\u201cOwner Bu! You\u2019re finally open for business! Oh my, there\u2019s a new dish! Come, give me a serving of every dish!\u201d Fatty Jin ordered his dishes in an experienced manner.Bu Fang expressionlessly nodded and headed toward the kitchen. His daily business had started.Ouyang Xiaoyi arrived at the store while enduring the cold wind. She rubbed her hands together and removed her fur overcoat and her hat, revealing her rosy face. There was automatic heating in the store, so the interior was quite warm and very cozy.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBu Fang cooked the dishes while Xiaoyi served them. The rapport between the two of them was becoming better and better.At the entrance of the alleyway, King Yu, with an imposing appearance and extraordinary temperament, slowly approached while wearing a brocade robe. He stepped into the store and indifferently sized up the interior.It was King Yu\u2019s first time coming to Bu Fang\u2019s store, so everything felt new to him. The astronomical prices of the dishes were especially interesting to him.After ordering a jar of Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine and a plate of Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs, King Yu began to sample the delicacies of Bu Fang\u2019s store.At the same time\u2026 He waited for the crown prince to arrive.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A rich aroma\u2014with an intoxicating scent that lingered around one\u2019s nostrils\u2014was emanating from within the wine cup.King Yu swirled the wine within the cup. When he tasted the wine, the mellow and spicy taste that erupted within his mouth caused the pores all over his body to tremble. It was the first time he drank such a delicious wine. It was far better than the Bejewelled Nectar Wine from the imperial palace.\u201cAs expected of the store that was able to let father come in person. Just this wine itself is enough for the customers to linger within the store,\u201d King Yu lamented. This was the first time he came to Bu Fang\u2019s store. Previously, he had only heard the rumors. This time, after personally experiencing it himself, he was finally able to experience the charm of the store\u2019s delicacies.The wine was a fine wine. The dishes were fine dishes.That tangerine-colored Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs and that dense steam accompanied by the fragrance of meat was like a beautiful and captivating picture.At the entrance of the alleyway, the crown prince was walking with his hands behind his back and his head held high. Xushi was the only one following him. His expression was solemn while carrying a gigantic steel cage with one hand.\u201cHmm?\u201d Bu Fang, who had just left the kitchen, puzzledly looked toward the entrance. He saw the crown prince and Xushi immediately placing a steel cage onto the ground after entering the store.\u201cOwner Bu, I\u2019ve come once more,\u201d The crown prince chuckled and said as he intensely stared at Bu Fang.If Bu Fang was able to cook the Elixir Cuisine, the emperor\u2019s health condition should improve. And so, as the person who offered up the Elixir Cuisine, the emperor would definitely be more favorable to Ji Chengan. His position as the crown prince would be even firmer and he would obtain an even greater advantage over his brothers.As he thought about all these, the crown prince became even more fervent toward Bu Fang, who could cook the Elixir Cuisine.The crown prince raised his hand and grabbed the cloth covering the steel cage. With a sudden pull, the interior of the steel cage was exposed.A Blood Phoenix Chicken with blood-red feathers was quietly standing within the steel cage. Its eyes were swiveling around its sockets.\u201cBlood Phoenix Chicken?\u201d Bu Fang was slightly stunned. Then, he looked at the crown prince strangely. He did not expect the crown prince to actually go through the trouble of catching a Blood Phoenix Chicken.\u201cThat\u2019s right, it\u2019s only natural that Owner Bu would recognize this Blood Phoenix Chicken. However, do you recall what you\u2019ve said before?\u201d the crown prince smiled and said.Bu Fang was expressionless as he walked around the steel cage once. He carefully examined the Blood Phoenix Chicken and could not help but compare it with the one provided by the system. He discovered that this Blood Phoenix Chicken provided by the crown prince was in every way inferior to the one provided by the system.\u201cThe ingredients provided by the system are all high quality products that went through careful selections. They\u2019re the cream of the crop among all the major varieties,\u201d the system\u2019s serious voice rang out within Bu Fang\u2019s mind.Bu Fang nodded. He believed that the ingredients provided by the system were definitely the best.He had indeed agreed that he would personally cook the Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup for the crown prince if the ingredients were provided.\u201cWhat about the Sage Herb and the other medicinal ingredients?\u201d Bu Fang asked.The crown prince\u2019s eyes immediately lit up. With a wave of his hand, a leather bag filled with medicinal ingredients appeared in his hand and he handed it to Bu Fang.The Heavenly Sage Herb was kept within a exquisite wooden box which he carefully handed over to Bu Fang as well.The Heavenly Sage Herb was very expensive and its value was comparable to the Blood Phoenix Chicken. Moreover, it was very difficult to harvest as it only grows within the Wildlands. That was a terrifying place with innumerable high grade spirit beasts. Even a seventh grade Battle-Saint might perish when exploring the Wildlands.However, as the Heavenly Sage Herb was only a fifth grade spirit herb, it was located at the outer perimeters of the Wildlands. So the crown prince was still able to collect it by spending a large amount of money.Receiving the Sage Herb that did not look too good, Bu Fang nodded and simply said, \u201cCooking the Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup takes a long time. Today\u2019s operating hour is almost over. Come here earlier tomorrow to collect the Elixir Cuisine. Since you provided the ingredients yourself, you\u2019re allowed to bring the dish back.\u201dThe smile on the crown prince\u2019s face froze as he thought, \u201cYou\u2019re not cooking today? Just because the business hours is over?\u201d\u201cOwner Bu, I really need this Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup. Could you cook it right now?\u201d the crown prince asked with a frown. These ingredients used up a large amount of his savings. He wanted to personally watch as Bu Fang cooked the dish, otherwise he would not be at ease.Bu Fang glanced at the crown prince and said, \u201cThe Elixir Cuisine is not as simple as you think. A lot of techniques are needed and I need to concentrate. If you don\u2019t believe me, you can go back and ask your imperial chefs.\u201cHonestly, the quality of the ingredients that you provided can only be considered so-so. I am really not interested in them. However, I really hate it when others doubt me. This is the first time, so I\u2019ll forgive you. However, if there\u2019s a next time, you can take your ingredients back,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly said as he indifferently looked at the crown prince.Ji Chengan was furious! Who would dare to speak to him in such a manner within the empire! And even dare to threaten him!\u201cYou\u2026\u201d The crown prince took a deep breath. When he thought about the store\u2019s background and Bu Fang\u2019s culinary skills as well as the miraculous Elixir Cuisine, the corner of his mouth widened into a smile as he suppressed his anger.\u201cI am not doubting Owner Bu. Fine, then I shall send someone to collect it tomorrow. I hope Owner Bu won\u2019t disappoint me,\u201d the crown prince said.\u201cHahaha!\u201dJust as the crown prince finished speaking, a burst of laughter filled with ridicule came from nearby.The crown prince slightly frowned as he looked toward the source of the laughter and immediately spotted King Yu.King Yu lifted up a wine cup and emptied it. Then he stood up and walked toward the crown prince with a warm smile plastered on his face like a refined scholar.\u201cMy beloved elder brother, I didn\u2019t think I would meet you here. Tsk, tsk, tsk. Are you here to let Owner Bu cook the Elixir Cuisine? This is for extending father\u2019s\u2026 life, right?\u201d King Yu simply said with a trace of a smile on his face.The pupils of both the crown prince and Xushi constricted. Previously, their attention was focused on Bu Fang, so they did not realize King Yu was within the store as well.\u201cHow could he be here?!\u201d The crown prince was both agitated and furious!The crown prince suddenly glanced toward Xushi with a meaningful look in his eyes. Xushi\u2019s body shuddered as he fearfully took a step back and bowed toward the crown prince.\u201cHahaha! What a coincidence, second brother. It looks like you were attracted by Owner Bu\u2019s food as well.\u201d A smile was on the crown prince\u2019s face as he nodded toward King Yu.King Yu, Ji Chengyu, was a peak-level fifth grade Battle-King. He was only a step away from becoming a Battle-Emperor. Among the three princes, his cultivation level was the highest.Even though the crown prince, Ji Chengan, and the third prince, Ji Chengxue, were both fifth grade Battle-Kings as well, they were only at the initial stage. Compared to King Yu, they were a lot worse.\u201cIndeed, Owner Bu\u2019s dishes are truly delicious and the wine is the best in the world. Elder brother, you should give it a try when you have the chance.\u201d King Yu chuckled as he placed some crystals onto the table and slowly walked out of the store.The smile on the crown prince\u2019s face gradually disappeared as he gloomily watched King Yu\u2019s figure fade away within the alleyway.With a high cultivation level and half of the imperial court supporting him, his young brother, Ji Chengyu, was the crown prince\u2019s greatest competitor and the source of his restlessness.\u201cOwner Bu\u2026 You really can\u2019t cook it today?\u201d the crown prince turned toward Bu Fang and asked.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Bu Fang simply replied as he expressionlessly turned around and sat down on a chair. \u201cIn addition, the service charge for cooking this dish is fifty crystals. Don\u2019t forget to pay.\u201d\u201cFifty crystals?\u201d The crown prince narrowed his eyes. With a wave of his hand, crystals were placed onto the table. Then, he turned around and stormed off in anger. As the crown prince, he did not lack money.Xushi sighed as he followed after the crown prince with a frown on his face.Soon, their figures disappeared within the alleyway as well.\u201cAll right, Xiaoyi, today\u2019s business hours is over.\u201d Bu Fang stood up and patted Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s head.

He stretched his body and languidly glanced toward the Blood Phoenix Chicken standing idly within the cage.\u201cSystem, if the quality of the Blood Phoenix Chicken is slightly poorer, would the effects of the Elixir Cuisine be affected?\u201d Bu Fang puzzledly asked.\u201cIf the quality of the ingredient is poor, the effects of the Elixir Cuisine would naturally be poor as well. This is common sense,\u201d the system solemnly said. Bu Fang was suddenly choked up by its words.He glanced toward the Blood Phoenix Chicken once more. Coincidentally, the chicken turned its head as well and its swiveling eyes were fixated on Bu Fang.\u201cWell, this is an ingredient provided by that crown prince himself after all. If the effects aren\u2019t good, it\u2019s not my fault,\u201d Bu Fang indifferently thought and his conscience immediately became clear.After closing up the store, Bu Fang did not immediately start cooking. He rested for a while and called out his system panel to have a look.Host: Bu FangGender: MaleAge: TwentyTrue Energy Cultivation Level: Third Grade (Has already achieved the ability to manifest true energy outside of the body. As the God of Cooking in the fantasy world, you will definitely need to make use of true energy when cooking. Work hard, young man.)Cooking Talents: UnknownSkills: Level One Meteor Cutting Technique (80/100)Tools: Fragments of God of Cooking (3/4)God of Cooking overall rating: Apprentice Chef (You can finally cook ingredients with your true energy.

True energy conversion degree: 900/1000System Level: Three Stars (Conversion ratio is at twenty-five percent.)As he focused on the system panel, Bu Fang\u2019s expression did not change but his mind was somewhat agitated. The turnover had already reached three thousand six hundred crystals. He only needed to earn another four hundred crystals to level up the system and his cultivation level would increase as well.And four hundred crystals was just about his turnover for a day.\u201cLooks like I\u2019ll most likely level up after tomorrow\u2019s opening hours is over. Will there be any special reward for reaching fourth grade Battle-Spirit? However, I should be able to complete collecting the God of Cooking set by that time as well,\u201d Bu Fang muttered.After resting for a while, he stood up and headed toward the kitchen. Preparing the Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup needed a lot of time and also required using true energy during the cooking process, so Bu Fang did not dare to be careless.He opened the door of the steel cage and immediately grabbed the Blood Phoenix Chicken. Even though its spirit energy was suppressed by the system, the struggle put up by a fifth grade spirit beast was not weak either.However, Bu Fang was an experienced chef after all, and handling ingredients was an easy task for him. After a while, he finished processing the Blood Phoenix Chicken.After taking out the Heavenly Sage Herb from within the exquisite box and some of the needed medicinal ingredients from the leather bag, Bu Fang began to prepare the Elixir Cuisine, Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup.\u2026King Yu was in a rather cheerful mood as he returned to his manor. Perhaps tasting delicious food and fine wine might be the reason, but Ji Chengyu felt as if he was floating as he walked.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that store\u2019s dishes to be that delicious. That Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine is truly unforgettable.\u201d As King Yu recalled the captivating taste of the Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine, he could not help but lick his lips as a trace of intoxication appeared in his eyes.Here was another fellow captivated by Bu Fang\u2019s food.King Yu suddenly felt somewhat regretful. He would have been able to taste these delicacies at an earlier date if he had gone to Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store earlier.Just when King Yu was thinking about the dishes cooked by Bu Fang, the head elder of Soul Sect, Hun Qianyun, appeared in front of him along with his subordinates. They were all wearing black robes and their appearances were quite sinister and terrifying.Even though his eyes flashed with disdain for a moment, King Yu was still smiling on the outside as he looked at them.\u201cDid you obtain any result while visiting that mysterious store?\u201d Hun Qianyun\u2019s hoarse voice, like the sound of gravel rubbing together, rang out, giving goosebumps to any listener.\u201cThat elder brother of mine has already caught the Blood Phoenix Chicken. He brought it to the store along with valuable medicinal ingredients and asked the owner to cook the Elixir Cuisine. However\u2026 that Elixir Cuisine will only be completed tomorrow,\u201d King Yu simply said.\u201cOh? It\u2019ll only be completed tomorrow?\u201d Hun Qianyun narrowed his eyes. The spirit fire pulsated for a moment, as if he was thinking.King Yu nodded and said, \u201cThe Elixir Cuisine is not an ordinary dish after all. Even the owner of that mysterious store will need to spend some time to cook it. However, this is great news for us.\u201d\u201cAre you thinking of sending us to ruin the soup tomorrow?\u201d Hun Qianyun puzzledly asked.\u201cThat\u2019s right, it must be ruined. Father is not only old and frail, he suffers from numerous undiagnosable illnesses as well. Forcibly extending his lifespan will only prolong his suffering. As his son, I don\u2019t want to see my father suffer\u2026\u201d King Yu simply replied. Then his gaze shifted toward Hun Qianyun and said, \u201cPrepare some men along with experts from within my manor and set up an ambush at the entrance of the alleyway tomorrow. Remember, you must ruin that Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup.\u201cIf you fail this time\u2026 You and your men can just get lost.\u201dHun Qianyun was indifferently standing at a distance. When he heard King Yu\u2019s words, the spirit fire within his eyes suddenly trembled. Then he saluted and withdrew from the room.As King Yu watched Hun Qianyun\u2019s disappearing figure, the corner of his mouth widened into a smile. Then he looked away into the distance and yelled out, \u201cPrepare a horse for me, I am entering the palace.\u201d\u2026The crown prince palace, on the left of the Gate of Heavenly Mystery.The crown prince, Ji Chengan, had a gloomy expression as he sat high above while looking down on the kneeling Xushi. The corners of his mouth were twitching, indicating that he was suppressing his anger.Xushi was feeling both terrified and helpless. He understood that the crown prince had already begun to suspect him, ever since they met King Yu at Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store.\u201cXushi, can you explain to me why King Yu would appear within that store?\u201d the crown prince asked.\u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t know.\u201d Xushi\u2019s expression froze.\u201cAfter instructing you yesterday that our visit must be kept a secret, we met King Yu the moment we arrived at the store\u2026 Are you telling me this is all just a coincidence?\u201d The crown prince chuckled.\u201cYour Highness\u2026 Are you doubting me?\u201d Xushi raised his head and solemnly looked at the crown prince. \u201cI\u2019ve been following Your Highness for many years. How could Your Highness not understand the way I work?\u201dXushi\u2019s tone was somewhat indignant and dejected.Ji Chengan was slightly startled. When he saw Xushi\u2019s dejected appearance, his cold expression became gentle. He believed that Xushi would not betray him.He was suspecting Xushi only because he was irritated by the expression that King Yu gave before he left. Why should the crown prince be bullied by a mere king?\u201cAlright, I was only befuddled by anger. There\u2019s no way I wouldn\u2019t know about your loyalty. Right now, go and prepare some experts first. Since King Yu already found out that we asked Owner Bu to cook the Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup, then collecting the soup tomorrow will definitely not be safe. Go look for more experts who are at least fifth grade Battle-Kings.\u201d\u201cUnderstood, Your Highness. I\u2019ll withdraw first,\u201d Xushi solemnly nodded and saluted as he left.However, after a while, Xushi\u2014who had just left\u2014hurriedly returned with an anxious expression on his face.\u201cYour Highness, I just received news that King Yu\u2026 entered the imperial palace to meet His Majesty.\u201dThe crown prince raised his eyebrows and a trace of coldness flashed in his eyes. After silently cursing, he hurriedly changed his clothes and headed for the Great Hall to meet the emperor as well.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2026As the night descended, the two crescent moons were suspended high above the sky with dark clouds shrouding them.Several figures suddenly landed in the alleyway where Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store was located. They were all wearing black garments that allowed them to move around unnoticed at night. The aura exuding from them was throbbing as true energy violently surged from their bodies.\u201cTomorrow\u2019s operation must not fail\u2026 We must definitely finish setting up the magic array by today.\u201dAmong the figures, a stooping figure appeared. Two lumps of eerie spirit fire were flickering within the darkness as a hoarse voice reverberated in the air.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Within the Great Hall, the emperor was languidly sitting on throne with one hand holding his chin. His body would lightly tremble from time to time as the sound of faint coughing came from his mouth.When the emperor saw the crown prince entering the Great Hall, a smile immediately appeared on his face as he softly said, \u201cChengan, you came. From what I heard from your second brother, you went to Owner Bu\u2019s place and prepared the Elixir Cuisine for me?\u201dWhen Ji Chengan heard his words, his expression slightly changed. However, he still respectfully bowed toward the emperor and said, \u201cFather, I was only worried about your health. I heard that Owner Bu\u2019s Elixir Cuisine has the effect of prolonging life, so I sent my men to purchase a Blood Phoenix Chicken from the Wildlands and asked Owner Bu to cook the Elixir Cuisine.\u201dKing Yu, Ji Chengyu, was within the Great Hall as well. He was standing in a distance with a smile on his face as he watched the crown prince with interest. He deliberately entered the imperial palace just to inform his father about this piece of news.Ji Chengan was planning to conceal his actions from their father, so that their father would definitely be impressed when he finally presented the Elixir Cuisine that could prolong lifespan. However\u2026 since Ji Chengyu informed their father about this piece of news first, the effect would not be as shocking.Furthermore\u2026 The most important point is that since their father already found out about the Elixir Cuisine, a gleam of hope would definitely sprout within his heart. And once the Elixir Cuisine was ruined, this trace of hope would be crushed as well. When that time came, the difference between expectation and outcome would surely affect their father\u2019s opinion of the crown prince.King Yu\u2019s eyes were flashing brilliantly as he looked at the crown prince with a bright smile on his face.The crown prince had already cursed King Yu countless times within his mind. How could he not understand King Yu\u2019s thinking. He originally concealed his actions from the emperor just to achieve the effect of impressing him. However, with the disrupting actions by King Yu, the resulting effect would surely be greatly reduced.\u201cYour actions are considerate, but I know my illness very well. However, I understand your intentions.\u201d The emperor gently smiled as a rare trace of kindness appeared on his face.The crown prince could only force out a smile. The only thing he could do was hope that Xushi could safely transport the Elixir Cuisine to the palace.However, he knew that King Yu would definitely not let things proceed smoothly.\u2026Bu Fang was slightly frowning while his hands were placed over the cover of the claypot. True energy was continuously flowing from his body into the claypot and continuously affecting the ingredients contained inside.Bu Fang was still unfamiliar with true energy culinary, so he did not dare to be careless in the slightest. He was afraid he would made a mistake and ruin this dish.Fine beads of sweat appeared on his forehead, but Bu Fang ignored them and was fully focused on cooking with true energy. Finally, there was a slight change in his expression and the corner of his mouth slightly curled up.After dispersing the true energy, Bu Fang pulled back his hand and heavily breathed out. He lifted up a glass of water from the table and drank a mouthful.This water was cold, fresh, and sweet. It was mountain spring water provided by the system that contained spirit energy and was nourishing to the body.He lifted up the lid of the claypot and took a look. The Blood Phoenix Chicken was quietly lying within the claypot. As the chicken soup bubbled, the jelly-like, translucent flesh would gently tremble. The color of the chicken soup appeared as amber. However, it was not as bright as the previous one Bu Fang cooked for Xiao Yanyu. This was caused by the difference in quality of the ingredients and Bu Fang could not do anything about it either.The essence of the Sage Herb and medicinal ingredients had permeated into the meat of the chicken and the soup, and a rich fragrance was wafting from the claypot.The cooking of the Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup was finished.After putting the lid back on the claypot, Bu Fang stretched his body and his neck while walking toward the entrance of the store. As he removed the door boards, the cold winter air rushed into his face. Bu Fang, who was feeling tired after working throughout the night, felt slightly refreshed and slightly recovered from his fatigue.After opening up the store for business as usual, Bu Fang placed a plate of Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs in front of Blacky and rubbed its immaculate fur. Then Bu Fang stood up, pulled up a chair and contentedly curled up on it. He wanted to rest for a short while.However, this break did not last long before Fatty Jin arrived with his buddies. Bu Fang could only start his busy day.On the main street of the imperial city, Xushi was heading toward Bu Fang\u2019s store while leading a group of people. The auras exuding from these people were very strong and the fluctuations of their true energy were almost distorting the air.Xushi did not dare to be careless in the slightest about the operation to transport the soup. The crown prince was already dissatisfied with him. If he also messed up this matter, he might as well take a hike.So he specially brought five Battle-Kings along with him to transport the soup, just in case something were to happen. After all, five Battle-Kings were already considered top tier combat power within the imperial city.The entrance of the alleyway was quiet and peaceful. As Xushi stepped into the alleyway, he immediately began to frown. He seemed to sense a cold burst of energy rising from the bottom of his feet.Was he imagining things? Xushi lowered his head and looked at the floor. It was still the old quartzite flooring. There was even moss growing between the gaps of the tiles. Everything was the same as usual.\u201cPerhaps I was just imagining things,\u201d Xushi thought as he shook his head and bitterly laughed. Then he led the group into Bu Fang\u2019s store.Within the store, there were a few scattered customers enjoying their meals with relish. They were all rich and influential people living within the imperial city. Like Fatty Jin, they did not lack money.\u201cOh, you\u2019re here.\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly nodded when he saw Xushi step into the store.\u201cWait for a while, the smelly boss is still cooking,\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi charmingly said as she motioned Xushi to wait.Xushi was somewhat nervous, but he still composedly nodded.After a while, Bu Fang finished cooking the last dish and let Xiaoyi serve it to the customer. Then he personally carried out a claypot from the kitchen. That claypot was still giving off steam as a rich fragrance spread everywhere.Xushi\u2019s eyes immediately lit up as he thought, \u201cThis is definitely Owner Bu\u2019s Elixir Cuisine! There\u2019s no mistake!\u201dXushi carefully received the claypot that Bu Fang passed over. After solemnly expressing his thanks, Xushi bid farewell to Bu Fang and left the store. The five Battle-Kings followed after him with grave expressions on their faces as well.From the moment Xushi received the Elixir Cuisine, his chest began to tighten and he became extremely alert.Violent true energy emerged from each Battle-King and surrounded Xushi to form a protective barrier.Blacky, who was lying at entrance, lazily lifted its eyes to glance at the group of people. Then it snorted and went back to sleep.Suddenly, a burst of chilly wind that was even colder than the bone-chilling wind blew into the alleyway from the entrance.Xushi and the others, who were transporting the Elixir Cuisine, had just reached the entrance of the alleyway when they felt goosebumps all over their body at the same time. Their eyes instantly widened and emitted radiance as they scanned their surroundings.\u201cWho\u2019s there! Come out!!\u201dWith a shout, a Battle-King expert concentrated true energy onto his fist and viciously smashed it toward a single direction.Ooom.As the fist filled with true energy smashed into the empty air, the pupils of the Battle-King suddenly constricted. He realized the floor of the alleyway was radiating black light.Two black circles filled with symbols appeared on the simple quartzite flooring and were rotating in the anticlockwise direction.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cDamn it! This is the killing array of the Soul Sect, the King of Hell\u2019s Soul Rending Array!\u201dXushi\u2019s expression became pale in that instant and his pupils nearly lost all luster.Suddenly, the black light rose up and completely enveloped the entire group, as if they were pulled into another world.With the sound of footsteps, several figures wearing black robes appeared and surrounded the alleyway. The aura of these figures were extremely powerful and the aura of the stooping elder leading them was even more terrifying.As the two lumps of spirit fire pulsated, Hun Qianyun opened his mouth and said, \u201cThe prey has entered the magic array\u2026 Begin the elimination.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A terrifying desolate atmosphere pervaded the alleyway.The expressions of the five Battle-Kings were grave as they formed a circle around Xushi, who was carrying the Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup. Their mission this time was to protect the Elixir Cuisine, so they must focus all their attention on protecting Xushi, who was carrying it.The black energy enveloping the air, under the guidance of the two black circular magic arrays rotating in the anticlockwise direction, gradually formed a gigantic simulacrum above them. This simulacrum was filled with an extremely terrifying aura.\u201cThis is the King of Hell\u2019s Soul Rending Array! It\u2019s the Soul Sect\u2019s secret magic array\u2026 Why would it appear in this place?!\u201d Xushi\u2019s eyes were filled with incredulity.Suddenly, he seemed to have thought of something. His pupils constricted as he looked toward the distance. There, he saw several figures wrapped in black robes appearing.\u201cYou\u2019re from the Soul Sect?! Are you here to ruin this Elixir Cuisine?\u201d Xushi shouted in a stern voice.\u201cDo it, don\u2019t waste your breath on him. Remember, there must be no survivors\u2026 Our identity must not be exposed.\u201d A hoarse voice as ear-piercing as gravel being grinded rang out.The figures wrapped in black robes did not say anything as they swiftly moved toward every corner of the magic array and completely surrounded Xushi and the others.Hun Qianyun, whose eyes seemed to have two lumps of spirit fire pulsating within, slowly walked out from the shadows with his back hunched over.At that moment, Xushi had already completely fallen into despair. Even though he was acting cautiously, he still fell for King Yu\u2019s trap.Xushi had always assumed that no matter how insane King Yu was, he would only send some powerful assassins to ruin the Elixir Cuisine. However, he never expected King Yu would actually conspire with experts from the sects!The sects were able to contend against the imperial court for so many years precisely because of their mysterious methods and secrets. Thanks to that, they were able to forcibly survive under Emperor Changfeng\u2019s continuous attacks year after year.Every single cultivator within the empire was well aware that the sects were powerful and not to be trifled with.Magic array was a method that the sects were specialized in using.\u201cKing Yu actually dared to conspire with experts from the sects\u2026 Is he not afraid that His Majesty will find out?!\u201d Xushi clenched his teeth and angrily roared.Hun Qianyun lightly exclaimed his surprise as his line of sight shifted toward Xushi. He began to laugh as he said, \u201cHow would the emperor find out? Once we eliminate you\u2026 No one else will know.\u201dXushi wanted to continue speaking, but the experts from the sects were already tired of wasting their breath on him. They immediately triggered their true energy, and the black simulacrum above Xushi and the others suddenly launched an attack at them.A gigantic palm formed completely with black energy was viciously heading toward Xushi. Its energy fluctuation was extremely violent.\u201cBlock it!\u201d Xushi angrily roared with bloodshot eyes.A Battle-King loudly shouted as the true energy throughout his body practically gained substance. He rose into the air and launched his attack toward the palm with all his strength.However, this tremendous attack by the Battle-King was like a mayfly trying to shake a tree. It did not cause even the slightest damage to the palm.Bang!With a loud noise, that Battle-King was ruthlessly smashed into the ground. The impact produced an intense tremor and cracks appeared around the area\u2026The true energy within the body of the Battle-King completely dissipated. He was actually swatted to death by the palm strike!Xushi suddenly felt a chill in his heart. As expected, the might of the magic array was extremely powerful.Hun Qianyun faintly smiled as he pointed toward Xushi with a withered finger and said, \u201cThey\u2026 must all die.\u201d\u2026The crown prince was sitting cross-legged within his palace. His eyes were closed as he tried to calm himself and quietly cultivate. However, after cultivating for a while, he still could not help but open his eyes and heavily breathe out.\u201cFuuu\u2026 I wonder how Xushi is doing. My eyelid has been twitching for a while, and I\u2019ve been having a bad feeling.\u201d The crown prince was frowning as he stood up and looked out of the window.He originally thought asking Owner Bu to cook the Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup and offering it to his father was a good move. However, he did not expect a trick employed by King Yu would turn it into a bad move that sabotaged him.The crown prince was feeling somewhat helpless as well and could not help but feel regretful. He was currently between a rock and a hard place and could only hope that Xushi was able to safely bring back that Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup. Only then, he would be able to avoid being hoisted by his own petard.\u2026\u2026King Yu\u2019s manor.King Yu was standing in front of the fish pond with crystal powder in his hands as he contentedly fed the fish. As he watched the fish within the pond continuously fighting over the crystal powder, the smile on his face became colder and colder.\u2026Sensing a slightly stifling feeling, Bu Fang\u2014who was curled up on a chair\u2014was slightly frowning as he stood up. He walked toward the entrance of the store and looked toward the direction of the alleyway\u2019s entrance.What he saw was a gigantic humanoid simulacrum blocking the entrance of the alleyway.\u201cWhat are they doing over there? Don\u2019t they know that what they\u2019re doing is hindering my business?\u201d Bu Fang was frowning and was somewhat displeased.The location of his store was already out of the way. Of all the places to stir up trouble, these people had to chose the entrance of the alleyway. Were they purposely making life difficult for him?Ouyang Xiaoyi curiously stuck out her head as well. When she saw the towering and majestic simulacrum, her rosy face was filled with astonishment.\u201cSmelly boss, what are they doing?\u201d Xiaoyi puzzledly asked.\u201cThey\u2019re stirring up trouble,\u201d Bu Fang simply said as he patted Xiaoyi\u2019s head. The moment he finished speaking, his eyes narrowed as the gigantic simulacrum suddenly exploded and a figure shot toward the direction of the store.\u201cOwner Bu, save me!\u201d A heart-wrenching shout rang out.Xushi was charging toward them in a miserable state. He was bleeding all over his body and one of his arms was completely broken. As he made the mad dash toward them, blood was continuously dripping. However, his other arm was still tightly holding the scalding claypot.Bang! When Xushi arrived in front of Bu Fang, he was already completely exhausted. As he knelt on the floor, blood was gushing from his mouth and he was bleeding from his arm. He was shivering as he held onto the claypot. He did not let even a single drop of chicken soup spill from the claypot.Frightened by Xushi\u2019s wretched appearance, Ouyang Xiaoyi hurriedly hid behind Bu Fang and timidly peeked out.Bu Fang knitted his eyebrows together as he looked toward the simulacrum that was slowly heading toward his direction and looked toward Xushi who was bathed in blood. For some reason, he was suddenly feeling very angry.\u201cThey actually dare to beat up my customer like this?! This is clearly an act of provocation toward Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store!\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly said but his voice was very cold.\u201cO\u2026 Owner Bu\u2026 The Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup\u2026 must not be ruined!\u201d Xushi trembled as he tried to pass the scalding claypot to Bu Fang. His eyes contained a trace of imploration and helplessness.A burst of black energy suddenly gushed out from his body and instantly covered Xushi\u2019s skin. Black smoke was seeping out from his facial orifices.Bu Fang\u2019s eyes focused onto Xushi. He felt the sliver of imploration in his eyes and could not help but reach out for the Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup.However\u2026 a black spear was suddenly shot toward them at close to supersonic speed and directly pierced through the claypot.With a loud crack, the claypot broke into pieces. At that moment, time seemed to have stopped for Bu Fang and Xushi.The spear pierced through the claypot and directly headed toward Blacky\u2014who was soundly asleep\u2014and collided with its head.With a bang\u2026 The spear broke into pieces and Blacky drowsily opened its sleepy eyes.\u201cSon of a\u2026 Who used embroidery needle to poke your lord dog?! Step forward right now!\u201dBlacky puzzledly looked around the surroundings and its doggy eyes finally locked onto the simulacrum at the distance.Xushi watched with a blank stare as the claypot broke into pieces. The Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup spilled all over and the crystal clear, jelly-like chicken meat rolled on the ground\u2026With a long sigh, Xushi closed his eyes in despair as smoke seeped out from his facial orifices\u2026 His entire soul was completely incinerated.\u201cYou must be the owner of the mysterious store\u2026\u201d A figure wrapped in a black robe walked over. Behind him was the simulacrum of the King of Hell controlled by the gigantic magic array.\u201cWere you the one who killed him? Was the soup ruined by you?\u201d Bu Fang coldly turned his head and said as he expressionlessly looked at the person in the black robe.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe spirit fire within Hun Qianyun\u2019s eyes lightly pulsated as he chuckled and said with a hoarse voice, \u201cThey say that your store is extremely mysterious, and even a seventh grade Battle-Saint like Xiao Meng was repelled. The might of this King of Hell\u2019s Soul Rending Array is not inferior to a Battle-Saint. I really want to test out the depth of your store\u2026 and pay homage to the two little guys that died.\u201dBu Fang knitted his eyebrows together as he glanced toward Hun Qianyun and coldly said, \u201cI asked whether you were the one who killed him, whether you were the one who ruined the soup\u2026 You only need to answer yes or no!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re really asking for it! How dare you be so arrogant when you\u2019re standing in front of my King of Hell\u2019s Soul Rending Array! So what if I were the one who killed him? So what if I ruined the soup?\u201d Hun Qianyun was somewhat angry as well. True energy suddenly gushed out from his body and the simulacrum of the King of Hell became even more solid.Blacky lazily got up from the ground. It glanced at the simulacrum of the King of Hell and rolled its eyes.\u201cEven if the King of Hell really climbed out from the netherworld, this lord dog wouldn\u2019t be afraid. What\u2019s a knockoff like you trying to play at?\u201d A gentle and pleasant voice of a masculine male suddenly rang out from Blacky\u2019s mouth and echoed within the alleyway.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Who\u2019s there?!\u201dWhen Hun Qianyun heard the extremely haughty voice, the spirit fire within his eye sockets suddenly swelled up and his aura became even more terrifying. He scanned his surroundings to find the owner of the voice.However, he was completely unable to find anyone who had the confidence to say those words among those present. The customers within the store were all cowering before his glare. That mysterious person was definitely not hiding among them.Bu Fang knitted his eyebrows together with a gloomy expression on his face. The ground littered with the chicken soup was emanating hot air. The hot air was naturally dissipated as the cold wind blew, accompanied by the rich fragrance of the chicken soup.\u201cKilling intent toward the host has been detected. Protection mode activated.\u201dA mechanical voice rang out as a gigantic white figure swiftly rushed out of the store and landed next to Bu Fang with a loud noise. Whitey stood straight while giving off a red light with its mechanical eyes.\u201cA puppet?!\u201d Hun Qianyun could not find the owner of the voice, so he gave up on searching. He was slightly surprised when his eyes shifted toward Whitey who appeared next to Bu Fang.Even though Hun Qianyun had heard of the the store\u2019s deeds, he had never really put in the effort to find out more. He only knew that the store was very powerful and could repel the seventh grade Battle-Saint, Xiao Meng. However, he did not know the source of its strength. From the looks of it\u2026 could this puppet be the reason?Blacky slowly approached while striding like a cat. When it realized Whitey was standing next to Bu Fang, it rolled its eyes and stopped moving.\u201cYou killed my customer and ruined my dish\u2026 Unforgivable!\u201d Bu Fang took a deep breath. His eyes focused onto Hun Qianyun and became somewhat cold.\u201cHmph! What an arrogant tone\u2026 This old man shall test the capability of this store of yours today!\u201d Hun Qianyun sneered as he took a step back. As he waved his withered arm, the gigantic simulacrum of the King of Hell suddenly moved.As the black mist surged, the simulacrum raised its hand and a black spear appeared once more. Black mist was encircling the spear while the energy violently fluctuated.With a loud tearing sound, the simulacrum of the King of Hell forcefully threw the spear. It rapidly headed toward Bu Fang\u2019s position while whistling through the air. It was as if the air was being torn apart.Whitey\u2019s mechanical eyes were flashing as its figure moved in front of Bu Fang. It raised up its gigantic mechanical arms and threw a punch toward the black spear flying toward them.A powerful explosion rang out and a squall was instantly created. The entire alleyway seemed to be enveloped by the black mist. Within an instant, the alleyway was completely engulfed.The customers staying within Bu Fang\u2019s store were all startled by the terrifying noise. However, the surprising thing was that the black smoke unexpectedly did not drift into the store. It was as if the smoke was isolated by a layer of protective membrane.Hun Qianyun sneered as he watched from a distance. Even a seventh grade Battle-Saint would suffer if they tried to receive the attack of the King of Hell\u2019s Void Spear head-on. What could a mere puppet do?Boom!Within the black smoke, only two sources of red light could be seen. Suddenly, they turned into a cold purple color. A gust appeared and completely dispersed the black smoke.Once the black smoke completely dissipated, the scene of the aftermath was revealed. When Hun Qianyun saw the scene, he was extremely shocked and the spirit fire within his eyes wildly palpitated.Whitey\u2019s entire body was releasing a metallic luster, and its mechanical eyes had turned into a cold purple color. Both of its arms were crossed in front of its body, which seemed to have blocked the King of Hell\u2019s Void Spear from before. There was actually no trace of damage on Whitey at all.Bu Fang was indifferently standing behind Whitey. He was expressionless as he looked at Hun Qianyun without any signs of worry or fear on his face.\u201cCombat mode activated!\u201d Whitey\u2019s mechanical voice became even colder. Its purple eyes seemed to be overflowing with killing intent.With a humming sound, purple-eyed Whitey\u2019s figure shot out in an instant. Its speed was almost impossible to be captured by the naked eye. A stifling feeling suddenly assailed toward Hun Qianyun.Hun Qianyun angrily snorted as he held out his withered hand. Borrowing the power of the simulacrum of the King of Hell behind him, he controlled the black energy to encircle his body and sent a palm strike toward Whitey.As the two of them collided together, an intense energy shockwave leaked out and cracks appeared on the walls of the alleyway, as if they were going to collapse from the energy collision.Hun Qianyun\u2019s expression suddenly changed. If they continued fighting with this level of power, the soldiers patrolling within the imperial city as well as experts would be alerted. He needed to finish things quickly!\u201cHurry up and finish off the owner! I\u2019ll stall the puppet!\u201d As an old-timer, Hun Qianyun naturally knew about capturing the ringleader first to capture the bandits. The puppet was obviously trying to protect Bu Fang. Once Bu Fang was dead, the puppet would lose its protection target and stop moving.The six Battle-Kings standing behind Hun Qianyun understood his intentions as well.The King of Hell\u2019s simulacrum was heading toward Bu Fang step by step. As the gigantic simulacrum moved, the alleyway was almost bursting from the seams.Bu Fang indifferently watched as the simulacrum approached. He patted Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s head and made her hide inside the store. With the store\u2019s protection, she should be safe.\u201cIs this brat seeking death? Why is he not running away even though he\u2019s facing the King of Hell\u2019s simulacrum controlled by us?\u201d one of the Battle-Kings controlling the magic array said in surprise.\u201cHe\u2019s probably so frightened his legs went weak and he has no strength to run away! Once the King of Hell\u2019s Soul Rending Array is activated, it\u2019s equivalent to a seventh grade Battle-Saint!\u201d another Battle-King said with a chortle.\u201cWhy isn\u2019t that brat pissing himself in fear yet? How could a third grade thrash like him withstand the intimidation aura of a Battle-Saint?\u201d\u2026\u2026Bu Fang completely ignored the mocking words of the Battle-Kings. The so-called intimidation aura of a Battle-Saint was completely ineffective to him. Thanks to the existence of the system, he was completely unaffected by any intimidation aura and he was completely unworried about his own safety.Blacky slowly approached while striding like a cat, as it gracefully and refinedly stopped between Bu Fang and the King of Hell\u2019s simulacrum.As Blacky raised its head and looked at the gigantic simulacrum of the King of Hell formed with black energy, a trace of disdain flashed in its eyes.\u201cShoo shoo shoo\u2026 Where did this big black dog come from! Get out of here!\u201d A Battle-King speechlessly looked at the dog sitting between Bu Fang and them. He was utterly dumbfounded as he hurriedly tried to chase Blacky away.They could not feel even a trace of spirit energy on this dog and its appearance was quite ordinary as well. It looked just like a commonplace dog. It was no wonder this Battle-King was unable to recognize it.\u201cYou idiot\u2026 Are you talking to this lord dog?\u201d Blacky haughtily raised its head as a gentle and masculine voice filled with mockery rang out.The six Battle-Kings were stunned\u2026 Their thoughts went into disarray for a moment.\u201cWhat the! Is this dog really\u2026 speaking?!\u201d\u201cYou idiot\u2026 Did you just tell this lord dog to get lost? Are you tired of living? Do you really think you can heckle this lord dog just because you have this King of Hell knockoff?\u201d Blacky continued and said.\u201cThis big black dog that became intelligent is really arrogant!\u201d The six Battle-Kings were immediately riled up. A mere dog actually dared to act arrogantly in front of them. It was simply too unforgivable.\u201cDamn dog! If I don\u2019t cook you up today, I\u2019ll follow your surname!\u201d A bad-tempered Battle-King was unable to bear it any longer. He angrily shouted and immediately created a black spear with the King of Hell\u2019s simulacrum.The spear was sent piercing toward Blacky with a whistling sound.\u201cYou actually dare to call this knockoff the King of Hell\u2019s Void Spear? Its power is no better than an embroidery needle\u2026 Even this lord dog wouldn\u2019t use it for scratching an itch,\u201d Blacky said as it rolled its eyes.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAs the black spear brutally collided with Blacky\u2019s head, Blacky\u2019s ears slightly flapped and the spear immediately broke into pieces. It turned into black energy and dispersed into the air.The bodies of the six Battle-Kings froze. What happened just now? Were they seeing things\u2026?\u201cEven though it isn\u2019t that damned old man from the underworld, this lord dog still hates this thing. Since you bothered this lord dog\u2019s nap, all of you\u2026 shall die,\u201d Blacky indifferently said as it stretched out an exquisite and cute paw. The paw slowly flew toward the King of Hell\u2019s simulacrum.Bu Fang slightly raised his eyebrows. From his point of view, during the moment Blacky extended his paw, it instantly expanded into a gigantic paw that covered the sky.Blacky glanced at the King of Hell\u2019s simulacrum underneath the paw and disdainfully snorted, then the paw gently descended.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They could not gather even the slightest courage to resist as they endured the terrifying aura.A harmless-looking dog turned into a murderous Yama in the blink of an eye. This change caused the six Battle-Kings to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown.With a breaking sound, cracks appeared throughout the magic array and then it exploded into pieces. The six Battle-Kings were vomiting blood from their mouths while kneeling on the ground. They wanted to run away but their bodies refused to obey.Crunch!As Blacky\u2019s paw completely landed, the sound of bones being crushed rang out and the ground slightly shook for a moment.At a distance away, Hun Qianyun was so scared that his soul was about to fly out. \u201cGod damn\u2026 So, the most terrifying thing within the store is not this purple-eyed puppet in front of me, but the big black dog lying in front of the entrance?!\u201d\u201cWhere exactly did this store come from? A single dog\u2019s paw smashed the King of Hell\u2019s Soul Rending Array into pieces and squashed six Battle-Kings to death\u2026 What exactly is the big black dog\u2019s cultivation level? Is it actually a ninth grade supreme spirit beast?\u201d\u201cA ninth grade supreme spirit beast is\u2026 guarding the door? Are you fricking kidding me?\u201dHun Qianyun was feeling so depressed he wanted to vomit blood. He could not help but regret his actions. He must have bumped his head when he decided to antagonize the store. In the first place, the mission was already completed\u2026 However, he courted disaster when he aimed to get rid of the store at the same time.Now, it was a situation where he went for wool and came home shorn, losing six Battle-Kings instead. Oh\u2026 There was a chance that he might even die there as well.Blacky\u2019s paw gradually restored back into its original exquisite size once more. It disdainfully shook its paw, then glanced toward Hun Qianyun and rolled its eyes. It strided like a cat toward its usual position, lay down and went back to sleep.Bu Fang seemed to be already well aware of Blacky\u2019s personality. It was not the first time that this lazy dog had immediately went back to sleep after showing off.Ouyang Xiaoyi was standing within the store with her hands holding onto the door frame. Her large eyes were glittering as she looked toward Blacky with eyes filled with adoration.\u201cBlacky\u2026 is really awesome! I wonder what breed of dog is it?\u201dBlacky\u2019s closed eyes moved and slightly opened. When Blacky noticed a pair of glittering eyes staring at it, it immediately snorted and turned over its head.\u201cDon\u2019t keep staring at this lord dog. This lord dog is not interested in human lolis\u2026 Bark.\u201dBu Fang expressionlessly walked a few steps toward the large crater caused by Blacky. It was in the shape of a dog\u2019s paw and a faint trace of black energy was rising from within.Within the large crater, the bodies of six Battle-Kings were completely squashed into meat paste. They were definitely done for\u2026At a distance, Hun Qianyun\u2019s strength immediately fell after losing the King of Hell\u2019s Soul Rending Formation\u2019s support. After dropping out of the Battle-Saint level, he was completely not an opponent for the purple-eyed Whitey. After getting struck by a punch, he was brutally flung into a wall of the alleyway and buried underneath a pile of rubble.Whitey\u2019s eyes were flashing purple and filled with a cold killing intent as it headed toward Hun Qianyun.Suddenly, a gigantic lump of spirit fire rose from the pile of rubble. A figure was enveloped within the fire as it dashed away and instantly disappeared into the distance.When Hun Qianyun realized the current situation was irreversible, he used one of Soul Sect\u2019s secret technique to escape. The price of using this secret technique was great, and he only used it since he had no other choice. Otherwise, he would be beaten to death by the purple-eyed Whitey.With its target gone, Whitey went into a daze for a few seconds. It raised its mechanical arms and scratched its bald head. Then the purple color in its eyes subsided and they became red once more.Looking at the messy alleyway, Bu Fang pursed his lips. From the looks of it, he would have to ask the crown prince to repair the alleyway when the latter came over or he would not be able to continue his business.Xushi\u2019s corpse had already mummified. His soul was completely incinerated and his skin had shriveled up.Bu Fang lightly sighed while feeling somewhat helpless. He was dumbfounded and could only let the crown prince resolve it himself.When the customers hiding within the store saw that the combat had ended, they bid farewell with Bu Fang and hurriedly left. Finally, only Bu Fang and Ouyang Xiaoyi remained in the store.After a while, the imperial city\u2019s patrol squads arrived one after another. Xiao Meng had a sullen expression on his face as he arrived at the alleyway filled with debris.\u201cThe battle seemed to have been quite disastrous,\u201d Xiao Meng thought as he looked down from the sky. When he saw the large pit in the shape of a dog\u2019s paw, his pupils constricted as he fearfully glanced toward Blacky who was lying at the entrance.He was slightly startled when he saw Xushi corpse and helplessly sighed.He sent someone to inform the crown prince and then began to clean up the battlefield.\u201cThis dog paw is truly overbearing. To be able to directly squash six Battle-Kings into meat paste\u2026 Their identities can\u2019t even be confirmed.\u201d Xiao Meng was somewhat unable to react.When Xiao Meng saw the Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup spilled all over the ground, he was able to deduce the general situation and his eyes became somewhat cold.\u201cFrom the way Xushi died, this should be caused by the Soul Sect\u2019s technique. Are the sects involved with the struggle between the crown prince and King Yu? This isn\u2019t a good thing,\u201d Xiao Meng softly muttered.After a while, the crown prince hurriedly arrived with his subordinates. When he saw the chicken soup spilled onto the floor and Xushi mummified corpse, he could not conceal the sorrow on his face. He clenched his teeth while his facial muscles trembled.He silently retrieved Xushi\u2019s corpse and promised Bu Fang to repair the damaged alleyway. Then the groups left one after another.The alleyway became low profile once more.Of course, that was only true if you do not look at the broken pieces of quartzite flooring everywhere and the large pit in the shape of a dog\u2019s paw\u2026After Ouyang Xiaoyi left the store and headed back to the Ouyang manor, Bu Fang closed up the store and ended the business for the day.Just as he finished closing up the store, the system\u2019s solemn voice rang out within his mind.\u201cCongratulations to the host for earning over four thousand crystals. For completing a short term objective, you shall soon receive a system reward. The system reward is being released\u2026\u201dBu Fang was startled for a moment, then the corners of his mouth curled up and a smile appeared on his deadpan face. He finally managed to level up\u2026It took him so much time to earn four thousand crystals. It was not easy, but he was able to endure it.After completing the short term objective, he could level up and obtain more strength. Even though his fighting capability was very weak, his cultivation level finally caught up and that was enough.\u201cYoung man who aims to become the God of Cooking, congratulations for completing a short term sales mission. You\u2019ve taken another firm step toward your objective of becoming the God of Cooking. Reward: cooking method of the Red Braised Meat, training method of the Big Dipper Carving Technique, and one fragment of the God of Cooking set.\u201d\u201cCongratulations to the host for gathering four fragments of the God of Cooking set. One part of the God of Cooking set will be randomly drawn.\u201d\u201cCommencing random drawing. Drawing is in progress\u2026\u201d\u201cDrawing completed. Congratulations to the host for obtaining the Golden Dragon Bone Kitchen Knife (God of Cooking set).\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe succession of words from the system overwhelmed Bu Fang. However, once he calmed down and combed through the information, he soon clarified everything.\u201cThe dish obtained this time is Red Braised Meat?\u201d When Bu Fang heard the system announcing the name, he could not help but lick his lips as he fantasized steaming pieces of rosy meat contained inside a claypot. The glittering grease was making him feel gluttonous. Red Braised Meat\u2026 was one of his favorite dishes.The appearance of a carving technique was a pleasant surprise to Bu Fang as well. He had always been weak at carving. Now, it was a good chance to make up for this shortcoming.However, the greatest surprise was the God of Cooking set that he had been looking forward to for a long time\u2026\u201cGolden Dragon Bone Kitchen Knife\u2026 Is it a kitchen knife made from dragon bones?

Started learning cutting and carving techniques. The road to becoming the God of Cooking has already opened for you. Work hard, young man.)System Level: Four Stars (Conversion ratio is at fifty percent. The host is permitted to carry out the capture of ingredients.)Bu Fang concentrated and examined the system panel that appeared in his mind. As he completed the missions, the system\u2019s level eventually advanced to four stars and the conversion ratio reached fifty percent as well.This would also mean that his levelling speed would increase substantially. However, reaching fifth grade Battle-King would require ten thousand crystals. Since the system\u2019s energy conversion ratio was fifty percent, he would need to earn twenty thousand crystals to level up\u2026Twenty thousand\u2026 There was no expression on Bu Fang\u2019s face. He was dumbfounded. With the current price of his dishes, how much time would it take for him to achieve a turnover of twenty thousand crystals?\u201cForget it, thinking about stuff like this is pointless. I might as well study the newly levelled system.\u201d\u201cSystem, what is \u2018The host is permitted to carry out the capture of ingredients\u2019 supposed to mean?\u201d When Bu Fang saw the last piece of information, he was quite puzzled and could not help but ask the system.\u201cBefore four stars, the ingredients used by the host are all provided by the system. After four stars, the host can choose to capture the ingredients by himself. The system will set the price of the dishes cooked using ingredients captured by the host,\u201d the system solemnly replied.Eh\u2026 Ah? Bu Fang was stunned for a moment. How was a chef with no fighting capability like him supposed to capture ingredients by himself?\u201cThe Golden Dragon Bone Kitchen Knife from the God of Cooking set has a suppression effect on most ingredients. I believe the host can do it. Work hard, young man!\u201d the system said.Bu Fang felt that this was a serious issue that he must thoroughly understand, so he continued to clarify the doubts in his mind. \u201cSystem, where am I supposed to go to capture ingredients? Around the empire?\u201d\u201cThe system will provide the teleportation function. The host can be sent to the gathering location of ingredients within the Wildlands.\u201dIt seemed really formidable by the sound of it, but was there really no problem with sending him to the gathering location of ingredients? Bu Fang was insecure about the entire matter for some reason.Just when Bu Fang was thinking about these problems, the true energy within his body suddenly started to seethe. His eyes slightly lit up as he knew this was the sign of a breakthrough.The difference between a third grade Battle-maniac and a fourth grade Battle-Spirit was presence of the true energy vortex within the dantian. This true energy vortex was equivalent to the soul of the true energy. It controls all of the circulation of the true energy within the body, so the fourth grade was called Battle-Spirit.At that moment, Bu Fang felt a warm feeling continuously emanating from his dantian. The true energy within his body was rapidly gathering in that location and slowly forming a vortex. When Bu Fang inspected the interior of his body, he saw a true energy vortex that resembled the milky way spiraling within his dantian.There was no expression on Bu Fang\u2019s face, but the trace of happiness in his eyes could not be concealed. He held out his hand and waved it in the air. As he exerted his will, a burst of true energy surged out from his true energy vortex. After becoming a Battle-Spirit, Bu Fang became more proficient at controlling true energy.After playing around with true energy for a while, Bu Fang got used to the changes of the true energy and his joyful mood gradually calmed down as well. Then he directed his attention toward the God of Cooking set.\u201cSystem, what about the Golden Dragon Bone Kitchen Knife? How do I take it out?\u201d Bu Fang asked.\u201cThe system is currently delivering the item. Please do not urge,\u201d the system solemnly replied.Bu Fang was immediately silenced and he did not know how to respond either. However, a speck of light soon appeared in the space in front of him and started moving around until a mysterious magic array was drawn in the air.With a humming sound, something seemed to be slowly emerging from the magic array.Roar!!Bu Fang was staring at the magic array. Suddenly, a deafening cry of a dragon sounded out, startling him, and rocked his eardrums.Within the magic array, a pitch-black kitchen knife slowly emerged and was floating in the air. A small golden dragon was bellowing while encircling the kitchen knife. The dragon\u2019s cry came from the mouth of the divine dragon\u2019s simulacrum.An intimidating aura instantly enveloped the store. Bu Fang\u2019s body and mind felt heavy, as if he was facing a towering mountain. It was almost difficult to breathe.Outside of the store, Blacky was having a small rest when it suddenly opened its eyes. Its expression was grave and extremely alert as it looked into the store.However, it seemed to have thought of something. With a roll of its eyes, it lay down and went back to sleep.The golden divine dragon\u2019s simulacrum swiftly flew out and instantly bit Bu Fang\u2019s wrist. Bu Fang felt a slight pain at his wrist and a drop of bright red blood flowed out from the wound. The drop of blood was then enveloped by the divine dragon\u2019s simulacrum and slowly flew toward the kitchen knife.Lastly, Bu Fang\u2019s blood was swallowed by the kitchen knife. The pressure that was like a towering mountain instantly dissipated and the divine dragon\u2019s simulacrum disappeared as well.On the wrist that was bitten, a simplified version of the divine dragon\u2019s image appeared. Bu Fang\u2019s mind seemed to have formed a link with the Golden Dragon Bone Kitchen Knife. With a single thought, he would be able to store the kitchen knife within the image on his wrist.\u201cThe Golden Dragon Bone Kitchen Knife (God of Cooking set) has been delivered. Would the host please accept the delivery,\u201d the system simply said.Bu Fang\u2019s eyes became focused as he grabbed hold of the plain and unadorned Golden Dragon Bone Kitchen Knife floating in the air. A harmonious feeling suddenly spread from the depth of his heart. With a flick of his finger and a snap of his wrist, Bu Fang easily performed a extremely magnificent knife flip.The corner of Bu Fang\u2019s mouth widened into a smile as he held the kitchen knife. As expected of the God of Cooking set, it was easy to use.At first, Bu Fang assumed that the Golden Dragon Bone Kitchen Knife would be a very gaudy kitchen knife made from golden dragon bones. He did not expect its actual appearance to in fact be an unassuming stainless steel kitchen knife.\u201cGolden Dragon Bone Kitchen Knife: A part of the God of Cooking set. It is made from the bones of the golden divine dragon and possesses the intimidating aura of the divine dragon. The aura has a suppression effect against all spirit beasts and has an execution effect on all spirit beasts under seventh grade. The host can change the form of the kitchen knife by expending half of your true energy. The kitchen knife has an spirit energy boost effect when processing ingredients, and prevents the loss of an ingredient\u2019s spirit energy,\u201d the system said.\u201cIt can change its form as well?\u201d Bu Fang was slightly surprised. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the God of Cooking set after all. It\u2019s extraordinary as expected. I shouldn\u2019t regard this kitchen knife the same way I regard other kitchen knives.\u201dFurthermore, Bu Fang suddenly thought, \u201cThe system is allowing me to head toward the Wildlands to capture the ingredients. The biggest reason should have something to do with obtaining the God of Cooking set.\u201dWith this Golden Dragon Bone Kitchen Knife around, he could execute any spirit beast under seventh grade. Even with his fighting capability, he was invincible while facing any spirit beast under seventh grade as long as he was holding this kitchen knife.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAfter the system levelled up to four stars, I managed to gather four fragments of the God of Cooking set and obtained the Golden Dragon Bone Kitchen Knife\u2026 Right after, I was permitted to capture ingredients by myself. What a coincidence that everything perfectly fell into place.\u201d Bu Fang chuckled.Personally capturing ingredients was an essential training for a chef. Only by having an in-depth understanding of the ingredients, would a chef be able to invest more emotions into the ingredients and cook even more delicious dishes.Bu Fang had always understood that the system was only there to assist him. It only opened the door leading to the path of becoming the God of Cooking. In order to become the God of Cooking standing at the summit of the fantasy world\u2019s food chain\u2026 Bu Fang still needed to continue working hard. Practicing his cutting and carving techniques were all for the sake of that goal.After clearing his mind, Bu Fang became expressionless once more. The Dragon Bone Kitchen Knife was rapidly spinning on his palm. Then, as his eyes became focused and exerted his will, the Dragon Bone Kitchen Knife transformed into a wisp of green smoke and flowed into the mark on his wrist.\u201cI\u2019ll try out the dishes unlocked by the system first. Red braised meat\u2026 The red braised meat provided by the system should be unusual,\u201d Bu Fang muttered after storing the Dragon Bone Kitchen Knife.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He still remembered the taste of the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant\u2019s Braised Spirit Pork. Even though Bu Fang found many flaws in the end, he had to admit the taste was pretty good.As a chef, it was impossible for Bu Fang to not have tasted Red Braised Meat before and he was quite familiar with its cooking method as well. However, he did not immediately get started as the system\u2019s Red Braised Meat might have a different cooking method.Bu Fang called out the system\u2019s description of the Red Braised Meat.\u201cCooking method of Red Braised Meat: The use of true energy culinary is required during the cooking process. It tests the host\u2019s control over true energy as well as the handling of ingredients. The meat used is from the fifth grade spirit beast, Heavenly Punishment Deer, from the Wildlands. The meat has a rich aroma, but easily spoils and becomes inedible if the host makes a mistake during the handling process.\u201dThe cooking method provided by the system for the Red Braised Meat was indeed different from the ordinary method. Bu Fang was somewhat surprised that true energy culinary was actually required during the cooking process. Would all of the dishes unlocked in the future require the use of true energy culinary?Furthermore, the meat used for this dish was actually venison instead of pork, which was the traditional ingredient for this dish. This was also greatly out of Bu Fang\u2019s expectations.Bu Fang stopped in front of the cupboard and opened it. A chunk of reddish venison was placed inside. It might be due to the fact that this venison was from another world, but its subcutaneous fat was slightly thicker than other venison that Bu Fang had seen before and was somewhat similar to pork. However, there would definitely be a difference in the tenderness of the two kinds of meat.A strange fragrance was emanating from the venison. It was a type of fragrance that did not evoke a person\u2019s appetite, but would induce them to smell the aroma.Bu Fang took out the venison and carefully placed it on the chopping board. As he exerted his will, the pitch-black Dragon Bone Kitchen Knife appeared in his hand.The kitchen knife spun around in his hand for a while, then Bu Fang scraped the surface of the venison and removed a layer of miscellaneous fat. Next, he brought out some spring water and soaked the venison for a while.After hitting the venison with the back of the knife, Bu Fang expressionlessly lifted up the kitchen knife.There was only one thing to note when handling the Heavenly Punishment Deer, it was being fast while ensuring the smoothness of the slices. This would allow the fragrance and the spirit energy within the venison to coexist in harmony and prevent the meat from becoming astringent.This was the first time that Bu Fang used the Dragon Bone Kitchen Knife, but there was no sense of ineptness in the slightest. The speed of his hands were very fast as he sliced the meat. With his Level One Meteor Cutting Technique close to culmination, this was not difficult for him.Ton ton ton ton!The clear sound of the Dragon Bone Kitchen Knife making contact with the chopping board resounded inside the kitchen. Within a short while, the chunk of venison was sliced into pieces. Each piece was smoothly cut and the handling was almost perfect.Bu Fang poured the boiling spring water into a bowl with the venison. The pieces of venison were completely immersed in hot water.Then Bu Fang began the preparation for other matters. This time, he did not fill the wok with oil since he could use the venison\u2019s grease. If he added oil, the different smell of the oil would affect the taste of the dish.Letting the wok heat up, Bu Fang waited until the temperature was just enough to scald his hand. He then removed the venison that was blanched in hot water, and extracted the moisture from each piece of venison using true energy before throwing them into the wok.As these pieces of venison entered the wok, a sizzling sound rang out and a rich fragrance continued to exude from the venison.Bu Fang was not bewitched by the aroma. He took out a block of brown sugar prepared by the system, crushed it into powder form and turned his attention to the wok.When grease started seeping out from the venison, Bu Fang poured the brown sugar into the wok and started stir-frying with a wok spatula.There was a certain rhythm with Bu Fang\u2019s stir-frying. This was from his experiences as a chef.Once the brown sugar melted into syrup form and enveloped each piece of venison, the venison that was originally whitish turned bright red in color. The meat was emanating a rich fragrance without restraint, which had completely enveloped the kitchen.After pouring spring water into the wok, Bu Fang placed a lid over the wok. At that moment, he became serious as well since the true energy culinary portion of the cooking process was up next.He circulated the true energy vortex residing within his dantian and directed his true energy into the wok to enclose each piece of venison.The bubbling sauce within the wok was causing the pieces of venison to wobble, and the subcutaneous fat of the venison was glistening like jade. The venison was continuously releasing a meaty aroma along with a rich fragrance.Once the sauce within the wok had mostly evaporated, Bu Fang withdrew his true energy. He removed the lid of the wok and began stir-frying. The sauce that was much thicker than before completely enveloped each piece of venison.After adding salt and soy sauce, the meaty aroma finally stabilized. The meaty aroma was accompanied with a rich fragrance while intertwined with a sweet scent\u2026 Just by smelling this aroma, Bu Fang felt a sense of hunger and was salivating.Taking out a blue and white porcelain plate, Bu Fang poured the Red Braised Meat onto the plate. The new dish was successfully completed.Even though true energy was needed during the cooking process, Bu Fang was far more proficient compared to the previous time when he cooked the Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup. It might have something to do with his breakthrough.As Bu Fang carried the plate of Red Braised Meat out of the kitchen and into the dining area, he was suddenly startled.The reason was Blacky was already sitting at one of the tables with blinking eyes as it stared in Bu Fang\u2019s direction\u2026 More precisely, at the plate of Red Braised Meat in Bu Fang\u2019s hands while letting its tongue hang out.The corner of Bu Fang\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201cThis lazy dog, it\u2019s already eager to eat from smelling the aroma of meat. However, the fragrance of the Red Braised Meat is indeed extremely enticing. It\u2019s even superior than the Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs.\u201dBu Fang took out another plate and placed it in front of Blacky before he started scrutinizing the plate of Red Braised Meat. Or perhaps calling it Red Braised Venison might be more appropriate.White steam was rising above the Red Braised Meat. The rind of the venison was rosy. The next layer of fat was white and not greasy. The final layer of lean meat was crystal clear and beautiful.After giving one piece to Blacky, Bu Fang picked up another piece of Red Braised Venison and put it in his mouth.The flavor of this dish was very unique. Once the meat passed through his lips, the faint sweetness of the sauce blossomed in his mouth. Immediately, he subconsciously bit down on the venison\u2019s rind. The flavor of the meat exploded like a bomb and instantly enveloped his mouth and taste buds. With a slurp, the entire piece of venison slithered down his throat. However, an urge to eat another piece immediately sprouted within his heart.In this manner, Bu Fang consecutively ate half the plate of venison, but he was still unsatisfied and completely unable to stop himself. It was as if he could not taste the flavor of the meat each time and he wanted to try once more.Blacky was also gobbling down the meat with narrowed eyes filled with satisfaction. And so, the man and the dog soon finished off the entire plate of meat.Satisfiedly curled up on a chair, Bu Fang breathed out a mouthful of hot air.Blacky returned to its position at the entrance and cozily went back to sleep. Sleeping immediately after eating\u2026 That was indeed Blacky\u2019s style.\u201cAfter using true energy culinary, the taste of the venison was simply too good to describe! The Heavenly Punishment Deer\u2019s scent and the aroma of the meat had completely fused together! This flavor created a sort of uncontrollable and completely unstoppable feeling!\u201d When Bu Fang recalled the taste of the Red Braised Meat, he could not help but stick out his tongue and lick his lips.After resting for a while, Bu Fang placed the plate into the automatic dishwasher and headed for his room with a satisfied mood.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIt was undeniable that sleeping after eating was sometimes a type of happiness.However, just as Bu Fang reached the door to his room, the system\u2019s voice resounded within his mind once more.Abrupt Mission: Would the host please get ready to proceed with your first ingredient capture by tomorrow.

The abrupt mission this time came faster than he expected. He was already given one even though he recently levelled up.\u201cProceed with the first ingredient capture\u2026 Only one day of preparation time is given.\u201d Bu Fang knitted his eyebrows together. \u201cIsn\u2019t one day a little too sudden?\u201d\u201cSystem, if I am going to capture ingredients in the Wildlands, what\u2019s going to happen to my store? Are we closing down?\u201d Bu Fang puzzledly asked.\u201cThe time limit for the host to capture the ingredients is only two days. If a suitable ingredient is not captured within two days, the abrupt mission will be deemed a failure and ten percent of the crystal conversion ratio will be deducted as punishment. During the two days, the store will be temporarily closed for business,\u201d the system said in its usual aloof tone.Bu Fang nodded. He was starting to understand this abrupt mission better. However he was also becoming more nervous since ten percent of the energy conversion ratio would be deducted if he failed\u2026 This was no different from gouging flesh from his heart.The energy conversion ratio was extremely important toward Bu Fang\u2019s levelling progress. It was not easy for him to increase the value to fifty percent. If he was deducted ten percent from failing the mission, he would have to cry himself to sleep.After giving a big yawn, Bu Fang returned to his room and laid down on his bed. After a while, the rhythmic sound of breathing resounded within the room.\u2026The crown prince palace.The crown prince\u2019s expression was gloomy as he tightly clenched his fists. His fingernails were digging into the flesh of his palms. It was clear how angry the crown prince must be feeling at the current moment.\u201cJi Chengyu\u2026 You actually dare to collude with sects from outside the border! You\u2019re courting disaster!\u201d Ji Chengan\u2019s face was ashen as he stared at Xushi\u2019s mummified corpse with eyes filled with unconcealable sorrow.Xushi had been following him for many years and had always been his most capable subordinate. However, he was now dead from Ji Chengyu\u2019s evil scheme. Even though the crown prince had no proof that King Yu colluded with sects from outside the borders, anyone with a discerning eye would be able to guess that King Yu was the culprit.\u201cJi Chengyu\u2026 Despite your claims of never making a mistake, you made such a big mistake this time. If even I could guess that you colluded with the sects, do you really think someone as wise as father wouldn\u2019t be able to tell? Do you really think father has gone senile?\u201dA trace of mockery suddenly appeared on the crown prince\u2019s gloomy face. The joy in his eyes was becoming more and more apparent.\u201cLike I\u2019ve said\u2026 You\u2019re courting disaster!\u201dThe crown prince\u2019s cold laughter, filled with repressed anger and killing intent, resounded within the palace.\u2026King Yu\u2019s manor.King Yu was leaning on the armrest of a sandalwood chair with one leg resting on the other, while lightly hitting his knee with his hand. His eyes were calm as water as he looked into the distance.His expression was serene and his emotions were indiscernible. However, it was this composure that made him seem even more terrifying.At the doorway, a stooping figure entered with tottering steps, as if a burst of wind was enough to knock him over.Hun Qianyun\u2019s aura was extremely weakened and had almost fallen to the level of a Battle-King. Evidently, the secret technique he used to escape caused great harm to his body.\u201cThis useless old man\u2026 greets King Yu.\u201d Hun Qianyun seemed to have become even thinner. He was nothing but skin and bones. The two lumps of spirit within his eye sockets had also become very dim.\u201cTsk, tsk tsk. Looks like our Soul Sect head elder\u2019s injury isn\u2019t light. It\u2019s almost as if I could crush you with a single finger.\u201d The corner of King Yu\u2019s mouth curled up as he mockingly looked down toward Hun Qianyun and lightly gestured with his finger.The spirit fire within Hun Qianyun\u2019s eyes trembled for a moment and his body slightly tensed up. A faint trace of pitch-black energy began to encircle his body.\u201cKing Yu, what\u2019s the meaning of this? Even though this useless old man is severely injured\u2026 The mission was successfully completed. Is there a need for King Yu to destroy the bridge after crossing the river?\u201dKing Yu glanced at him and indifferently replied, \u201cThat\u2019s right, you completed the mission. However, you also created a huge problem for me. Do you really not know?\u201cI only needed you to ruin that Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup. After you killed my brother\u2019s men, you just needed to destroy the corpses and avoid leaving any evidence. But\u2026 Why did you provoke that mysterious store?\u201d King Yu\u2019s tone suddenly became cold. As he stood up from his chair, his upright body was releasing an intimidating aura.The aura of someone belonging to the upper class came crashing down on Hun Qianyun.Hun Qianyun sighed within his mind. As expected of Emperor Changfeng\u2019s son, King Yu was impressive. Even though his strength fell short, his aura was not weaker than Hun Qianyun\u2019s in the slightest\u2026However, Hun Qianyun was actually not too worried. At the current moment, King Yu would not dare to have a falling out with the Soul Sect, so the probability of King Yu planning to kill him was low.Sure enough, King Yu\u2019s aura soon dissipated as he indifferently swept his gaze over Hun Qianyun.\u201cI\u2019ll let you off this time. However, you should know that there\u2019s a limit to my patience. If you screw up the next mission, then it won\u2019t end with just taking a hike,\u201d King Yu indifferently said as he held his hands behind his back, while true energy which nearly tore the air apart encircled his body.Hun Qianyun took a deep breath. King Yu was already a peak-level fifth grade Battle-King. He was only one step away from becoming a sixth grade Battle-Emperor.After Hun Qianyun withdrew, King Yu was the only person left within the palace.He raised his hand and a lump of true energy gathered on his palm. Then, he suddenly crushed it\u2026\u201cMy dear brother, you\u2019re probably celebrating right now from discovering my weak point. But\u2026 so what? If father really wants to execute me, then this son will just have to\u2026 revolt.\u201d\u2026Xiao Meng passed through the Gate of Heavenly Mystery. When he turned around and looked at the towering Great Hall, he helplessly sighed.Even someone as willful and bold as Emperor Changfeng lost to time in the end. After campaigning against the sects for over a hundred years, his own son actually colluded with the sects to destroy his final hope of prolonging his life\u2026 It was really ironic.\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t become a supreme being, you\u2019re still a mortal in the end\u2026\u201d With a solemn expression on his face and his eyebrows knitted together, Xiao Meng lightly sighed as he left.Within the Great Hall, the elderly emperor was sitting on his throne. As he continued coughing, his aura became even weaker. A trace of lethargy seemed to have appeared on his face.Lian Fu\u2019s face was filled with worry and sorrow as he watched the emperor.\u201cYour Majesty\u2026 Should I get the imperial physician to have another look?\u201d Lian Fu asked.The emperor waved him away. His eyes were somewhat cloudy, but the air of superiority around him had not diminished in the slightest.\u201cMy lifelong wish has always been to wipe out the sects and bring peace to the empire. The existence of the sects will always be a latent danger,\u201d the emperor said in a hoarse voice with an indifferent tone. \u201cNow, my wonderful son actually colluded with the sects for the sake of obtaining the throne. Don\u2019t you think this is rather ironic?\u201cThis old face of mine is feeling hot from embarrassment.\u201dLian Fu did not say anything as he respectfully stood on one side with a solemn expression.The emperor was trembling as he stood up. As he started chuckling, his harsh laughter resounded within the Great Hall.\u201cI am Emperor Changfeng, the great emperor who wiped out hundreds of sects. Even though I am past my prime, I still can\u2019t let my own son embarrass me like this. Sons should give their fathers the fear and respect they deserve\u2026 He\u2019ll understand this soon enough.\u201dThe faint voice, filled with mad arrogance and confidence, resounded within the Great Hall and then gradually dissipated.Lian Fu\u2019s expression became even more respectful as he bowed and watched the emperor\u2019s disappearing figure.\u2026The next day, early morning.Bu Fang opened up the store as usual. However, he had to tell Xiaoyi that the store would be temporarily closed for two days. Otherwise, she would come to the store as always and find the entrance closed.Fatty Jin and his buddies arrived and the empty store became a little livelier. With his sharp eyes, Fatty Jin discovered the new dish, Red Braised Meat, and his eyes immediately lit up.\u201cOwner Bu, this new dish is a bit expensive\u2026 It actually costs a hundred crystals. That\u2019s not cheap at all.\u201d The price of the Red Braised Meat slightly extinguished Fatty Jin\u2019s excitement. After all, even a nouveau riche would still feel the pain of spending a few hundred crystals per day.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThe new dish won\u2019t disappoint you. Trust me,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly replied.Fatty Jin narrowed his eyes and stared at Bu Fang for a long while before deciding to order the Red Braised Meat. The corners of Bu Fang\u2019s mouth curled up as he turned around and entered the kitchen.When he walked out of the kitchen with the plate of the overwhelmingly fragrant Red Braised Meat, Xiaoyi had already arrived at the store.At the entrance, an elderly and familiar figure was slowly stepping into the store.\u201cOwner Bu, the characters on your signboard are not as good as my penmanship,\u201d the elderly man said with a chuckle.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Very SimpleTranslator:\u00a0OnGoingWhy\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0VermillionThe elderly person who stepped into the store was none other than the current emperor, Ji Changfeng.Ji Changfeng\u2019s complexion was somewhat pallid. He looked extremely delicate, just like an elderly person with one foot in the grave. The air of superiority that belonged to an emperor was missing.\u201cI saw the signboard hanging above the entrance. The characters look like they were engraved using a template. The lack of energy makes it extremely awkward to read. Even though it looks good on the surface, it won\u2019t be able to withstand a thorough assessment. It\u2019s inferior to my penmanship,\u201d the emperor said with a chuckle as he held his hands behind his back.Bu Fang raised his eyebrows. He was not surprised that the emperor came to his store, but he did not expect him to arrive at such an early hour.The signboard at the entrance was provided by the system. At that time, Bu Fang rejected the emperor\u2019s offer for a signboard only because the system was going to provide one. Now it seemed\u2026 the signboard provided by the system was not that impressive.\u201cSystem, the emperor said the characters on the signboard you provided are poorly written,\u201d Bu Fang said to the system.The response was a short moment of silence before the system\u2019s solemn voice rang out, \u201cThe characters on the signboard are replicates of the handwriting of the Light Wind Empire\u2019s number one calligraphist. There is no problem. As for the lack of energy mentioned by the emperor, the system is unable to answer.\u201dBu Fang nodded. The signboard provided by the system\u2019s ability was definitely not ordinary. However, the characters might have been lacking in energy since they were replicates.No longer interested in this topic, Bu Fang expressionlessly asked, \u201cYour Majesty, are you here today to eat?\u201dThe emperor sat down at a table, waved him away and said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to hurry. I have some questions that I need you to answer.\u201d\u201cHmm? What sort of questions?\u201d Bu Fang asked.\u201cI am afraid there won\u2019t be any more chances if I don\u2019t ask them right now.\u201d The emperor\u2019s body slightly trembled as he coughed. Then he raised his head and seriously looked at Bu Fang with murky eyes. \u201cNot only are you the master of a supreme spirit beast as well as a puppet equivalent to a seventh grade Battle-Saint, you\u2019re also capable of cooking dishes filled with spirit energy\u2026 Owner Bu, who exactly are you?\u201cWhat\u2019s your objective of staying within the imperial city of the Light Wind Empire?\u201dBu Fang slightly raised his eyebrows as he stared at the emperor. Both of their gazes silently collided in mid-air.After a long while, Bu Fang expressionlessly replied, \u201cI don\u2019t have any objectives. I simply want to run a small restaurant.\u201dThe emperor\u2019s expression froze and he shook his head while giving a wry smile. \u201cImpossible. The strength of your store is comparable to the entire Light Wind Empire. There\u2019s no way you would open a restaurant just to run it. If you don\u2019t want to say it, then I won\u2019t force you. However, I hope you would give a proper answer for my last question.\u201d\u201cSpeak,\u201d Bu Fang replied.The emperor lightly coughed while holding his chest, then raised his head and asked, \u201cYou\u2019re not someone from the sects, right? You won\u2019t do anything that would threaten the empire, right?\u201dThis question was his true purpose for the visit. As an emperor\u2014even an emperor that was about to pass away\u2014he could not tolerate an unknown factor that he could not control to exist within his empire.However, with the existence of the supreme spirit beast, the emperor did not even have the slightest confidence in destroying the store. He could only settle for the next best thing. He wanted to be at ease by finding out the true purpose of the store.Nonetheless, the truth was Bu Fang opened a restaurant within the Light Wind Empire\u2019s imperial city to earn crystals in a low-key manner and raise his cultivation level. It was all in order to become the God of Cooking who stands at the pinnacle of the fantasy world\u2019s food chain. His objective\u2026 was really that simple.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, that won\u2019t happen.\u201d The corner of Bu Fang\u2019s mouth widened into an awkward smile as he solemnly replied the emperor.The emperor was surprised for a moment. Then smile appeared on his wrinkled face and later turned into a big laughter.\u201cOwner Bu, I feel much more relaxed after hearing your words. I am feeling happy, so I\u2019ll have all of the dishes today. This might be the last time I\u2019ll be able to enjoy a meal here.\u201dAfter the emperor finished laughing, he took a deep breath and clapped his hands as he said.Lian Fu, who was waiting outside, walked into the store while pinching his thumb and middle finger together. He respectfully stood behind the emperor with eyes filled with worry.Bu Fang nodded, then went into the kitchen.After a while, a rich fragrance wafted out from the kitchen. The emperor narrowed his eyes and became somewhat captivated from smelling the aroma.\u201cAfter living for so many years and eating so much delicious food, Owner Bu\u2019s dishes are still the most captivating. Unfortunately\u2026 I only met Owner Bu at my final moments. I wonder if this is a reward from the heavens or a punishment,\u201d the emperor softly muttered to himself.Xiaoyi obediently carried out the dishes and placed them in front of the emperor. The emperor chuckled as he stroked her head with an expression filled with tenderness.After eating and drinking to his fill, the emperor left the store with Lian Fu following behind him. While standing at the entrance, Bu Fang lightly sighed as he watched the emperor\u2019s elderly back figure.\u2026\u201cXiaoyi, you don\u2019t have to come for the next two days. I\u2019ll be going out to do something, so the store will be temporarily closed for two days.\u201d Once the business hours had ended for that day, Bu Fang expressionlessly said while patting Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s head.\u201cAh? Smelly boss, are you going to the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant to cause trouble again?\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi excitedly raised her head and looked at Bu Fang. Her lively eyes were filled with excitement.Bu Fang\u2019s complexion slightly darkened. \u201cWho told you I\u2019ll be causing trouble just because the store is taking a break\u2026 I have something important to do for the next two days.\u201d\u201cSigh\u2026 Alright, if smelly boss still wants to go to the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant, you must definitely invite me as well! You were really handsome when you slapped their owner in his face!\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s eyes narrowed into slits as she waved around her tiny fists and said with a grin.\u201cI was only speaking the truth. I did no such thing like slapping his face. Also, you should make use of these two days to properly cultivate. I hope that your cultivation will improve when I return. In the future, the requirement for eating my dishes will be even higher,\u201d Bu Fang said.The moment cultivation level was mentioned, Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s eyes lit up. She held out her hand like she was showing off and said, \u201cSmelly boss, take a look! My cultivation has already reached the intermediate level of third grade Battle-Maniac!\u201dBu Fang glanced at Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s smug expression and expressionlessly said, \u201cIs that fast? Even though you\u2019ve been eating so many of the store\u2019s dishes that are filled with spirit energy, your cultivation progress is still so slow. This proves that you\u2019ve been slacking off. Look at me, I am already a fourth grade Battle-Spirit.\u201d\u201cSmelly boss, you\u2019re really annoying\u2026 Forget it, this young lady is going back! Hmph!\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi snorted in exasperation as she turned around and left the store while puffing out her cheeks.After Ouyang Xiaoyi left, Bu Fang squatted in front of Blacky. He was stroking Blacky\u2019s soft and immaculate fur as he said, \u201cLazy dog, I won\u2019t be around for the next two days. You\u2019ll have to look for food on your own.\u201dBlacky lazily opened its eyes. When it heard Bu Fang\u2019s words, it immediately snorted and rolled its eyes.Bu Fang went back into the store and he took out a piece of wooden board with the words: Business is temporarily suspended. After hanging up the wooden board, he closed up the store and went back into the kitchen.\u201cSystem, since I\u2019ll need to find the ingredients by myself in the Wildlands, will you be providing condiments?\u201d Bu Fang asked.\u201cThey\u2019re not provided,\u201d the system coldly replied.Bu Fang seemed to have already predicted the system\u2019s response. He softly replied, \u201cOh.\u201d Then he took out a large piece of cloth and placed salt, soy sauce, pepper and other condiments onto the cloth. Along the way, he grabbed a large wok, that was filled with kitchen knives, spatula and other kitchen tools. He was going to pack them as well\u2026\u201c\u2026The purpose of heading to the Wildlands is to capture ingredients and not to go for a picnic. Would the host please understand the main content of the mission. Condiments can be brought along but cooking tools, except for equipment from the God of Cooking set, are not allowed,\u201d the system solemnly said.Bu Fang\u2019s body suddenly froze while in the middle of packing, then he expressionlessly let out a sigh. \u201cWouldn\u2019t I need to cook the ingredients after capturing them? How would I bring out the delicious flavor of the ingredients to the maximum without cooking tools?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThis time, the system could not even be bothered to reply Bu Fang\u2026In the end, Bu Fang only wrapped a few condiments within the cloth bundle and went back to his room to replenish his sleep.The next day, as the first ray of light brightened the horizon, Bu Fang was woken up by the system\u2019s beeping.\u201cWould the host please pay attention. The teleportation array will be activated in five minutes. Please prepare for the teleportation.\u201dBu Fang was surprised for a moment. As he raised his head, he realized a speck of light had appeared above his head and was rapidly drawing a mysterious magic array.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There were many lofty mountains, unending mountain rivers, boundless seas, and even lakes shrouded in miasma.The Wildlands was a vast plain that was situated outside of the Light Wind Empire\u2019s border. There was a large forest as well as a large lake within the plain. However, these were not the main point. The reason for the Wildlands\u2019 naming was that innumerous spirit beasts were living within the boundless plain. These spirit beasts were unevenly matched with variation in their strength.Like a nested circle, the Wildlands was divided into three layers: outskirts, inner, and center. The strength of the spirit beasts scattered within each layer was different. The closer toward the center, the stronger the spirit beasts were\u2026 There were even rumors that ninth grade spirit beasts dwell in the center of the Wildlands.Therefore, the center area of the Wildlands was also known as the forbidden region for humans. Even a seventh grade Battle-Saint would not dare to step into the area. In front of a ninth grade supreme beast, a human Battle-Saint was not any different from an ant.The outskirts of the Wildlands.With a series of explosions, hurricanes suddenly emerged and demolished the trees in the surrounding area. Three figures were rapidly moving between the trees while constantly releasing violent energies.Amidst the hurricanes, two figures charged toward the spirit beast in front of them in an attempt to surround it. Their target was the spirit beast that was trying to escape.The spirit beast\u2019s running speed was extremely fast and the aura exuding from it was very powerful as well. It was actually a sixth grade spirit beast. Electricity was constantly flickering over its body while producing hissing sounds. As it dashed through the area, a burning smell lingered in the air.\u201cSecond brother! The Thunderfire Spirit Pig has slowed down! We must not let it escape!\u201d A clear, tender voice rang out as a stream of true energy burst forth and struck the Thunderfire Spirit Pig running ahead of them.With a roar, the Thunderfire Spirit Pig became even faster and directly knocked down a large tree. An electric arc jumped from its body and immediately set the broken tree on fire.A man in green garments with fluttering long hair was chasing after the spirit beast while standing on a flying sword. While faintly smiling, he looked toward the Thunderfire Spirit Pig fleeing in a distance and said, \u201cJunior sister, there\u2019s no need to hurry. Even though the Thunderfire Spirit Pig is a sixth grade spirit beast, it only has a strong defense. Its combat ability, speed, and stamina are weak. Soon, it\u2019ll obediently stop.\u201dNext to the handsome man, an adorable young girl with large eyes was excitedly staring at the Thunderfire Spirit Pig. She had a smile on her face with two lovely dimples in her cheeks.Suddenly, the man was slightly surprised for a moment as he puzzledly looked toward the distance.The fleeing figure of the Thunderfire Spirit Pig suddenly stopped. In front of the spirit pig, the empty space had suddenly become distorted. Thereafter, a hurricane burst forth from the distortion. Bright specks of light were flashing within the hurricane.Boom!With a loud explosion, the hurricane fell apart and a slender figure appeared within the magic array constructed with light.With an angry roar, the Thunderfire Spirit Pig\u2019s speed was not inferior from before as it charged toward the slender figure that suddenly appeared. It was still a sixth grade spirit beast after all. Even if its combat abilities are weak, the impact caused by such a charge would still be devastating.\u201cHmm? What the hell is this?\u201d That slender figure seemed to still be in a daze. When he raised his head and noticed a pig fiercely charging toward him, he immediately raised his eyebrows and indifferently spat out the sentence.\u201cBe careful!\u201d Even though the man in green garments did not understand how the slender young man suddenly appeared, he still threw out a warning out of goodwill.The young girl with dimples following behind him had also turned pale from fright. She covered her eyes with hands as she did not dare to watch the tragic scene that was about to occur\u2026The man in green garments did not expect someone to suddenly appear in front of the Thunderfire Spirit Pig. Even though the combat power of the spirit beast was not strong, its defensive power was terrifying. With its tough skin and dense muscles, even a sixth grade Battle-Emperor would be seriously injured by its fierce charge. An ordinary person would most likely be immediately squashed into minced meat.However, the scene that occurred in the next moment caused the expression of the man to suddenly freeze and his eyes to be filled with incredulity.Despite facing the charge of the Thunderfire Spirit Pig, that young man seemed to be completely unfazed. There was no change in his expression and his eyes were as calm as water. He only saw an unassuming kitchen knife appear within the young man\u2019s hand.\u201cAre you serious\u2026 What\u2019s the point of taking out a kitchen knife when you\u2019re facing the charge of a Thunderfire Spirit Pig?\u201d This was the first thought that the man in green garments had when he saw the kitchen knife.However, the result was completely outside of his expectations. The speed of the Thunderfire Spirit Pig did not decrease at all, while the unassuming kitchen knife held by the young man actually started radiating a brilliant golden light. The man in green garments was unable to open his eyes due to the dazzling golden light.After the light subsided, everything became quiet once more.When the man in green garments saw the scene before him, his mouth slightly opened and his face was filled with horror and solemnity. The young girl next to him exclaimed in surprise as well and her large eyes opened even wider.The Thunderfire Spirit Pig was actually split into two halves while it was still alive. Its gigantic body had fallen to the ground and blood was spilled everywhere. There was still some electricity jumping about within the pool of blood.That young man put away his unassuming kitchen knife and walked toward the Thunderfire Spirit Pig while carrying a bundle. He squatted down next to the Thunderfire Spirit Pig and seemed to be observing its corpse.The man in green garments and the young girl hurriedly descended and did not dare to make the slightest noise. By the fact that the person in front of them could kill the Thunderfire Spirit Pig which was known for its defensive power with a single blow, there was no doubt that he was definitely a powerful expert.He might even be a seventh grade Battle-Saint!\u201cYour exce\u2026 Senior, what an amazing move! Killing the Thunderfire Spirit Pig with a single blow, you were truly awe-inspiring.\u201d The man in green garments had a smile on his face as he spoke to the young man who was observing the corpse of the Thunderfire Spirit Pig.The young man expressionlessly lifted his head and glanced at the man in green garments and the girl with dimples standing behind him. He indifferently nodded and stood up.\u201cThe meat of the Thunderfire Spirit Pig contains thunder and fire elements. It\u2019s a pretty good ingredient. Sadly, it\u2019s still quite lacking compared to the ingredient that I\u2019m hoping to capture,\u201d the young man muttered to himself. However, these words sounded like thunder in the ears of the man in green garments.\u201cGosh\u2026 He\u2019s definitely an exponent! Even the sixth grade Thunderfire Spirit Pig is not good enough for him, is he here to look for a seventh grade spirit beast?\u201d the man in green garments thought.\u201cHmm\u2026 What are your names? What are you doing here?\u201d The young man asked the man in green garments while having an unchanging expression.\u201cSenior, I am Tang Yin, a disciple of the Celestial Arcanum Sect. This is my junior sister, Lu Xiaoxiao. Dare I ask your distinguished name?\u201d Tang Yin respectfully said. After a closer observation, he realized the true energy fluctuation coming from the young man\u2019s body was actually not that strong. It was approximately around the level of a fourth grade Battle-Spirit. Even so, he still spoke in a respectful manner.Fourth grade Battle-Spirit\u2026 How could someone with such a cultivation level dare to enter the Wildlands? Obviously\u2026 There was no way a person who could kill a sixth grade spirit beast with a single blow with a kitchen knife could be a fourth grade Battle-Spirit!\u201cOh, my name is Bu Fang. I am a chef. I am from\u2026 err, the Light Wind Empire.\u201d Bu Fang earnestly introduced himself as well.\u201cEh\u2026 Ah? A chef? Did you really just introduce yourself as a chef?\u201d Tang Yin thought.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBoth Tang Yin and Lu Xiaoxiao had weird expressions on their faces. They had to admit that the hobbies of the powerful were indeed difficult to fathom. Their own master, the third elder of the Celestial Arcanum Sect, spent a lot of time researching culinary in the kitchen as well.\u201cSenior, could you sell this Thunderfire Spirit Pig to us? My junior sister and I came all the way to the Wildlands for the sake of this Thunderfire Spirit Pig\u2026\u201d Tang Yin said while performing a fist and palm salute.Bu Fang thought for a moment as he glanced at the corpse of the Thunderfire Spirit Pig. The corners of his mouth widened into a smile as he said, \u201cYou can have it, since I don\u2019t need this ingredient anyway. Other than cooking, there should be no other uses for the meat of the Thunderfire Spirit Pig. Are the two of you chefs as well?\u201dTang Yin\u2019s pupils slightly constricted as the admiration in his heart toward Bu Fang suddenly blossomed. As expected of a senior! He actually figured out their intentions for collecting the Thunderfire Spirit Pig with a single glance! He was right! They were there in order to collect ingredients for their master!\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re a chef or not. I have a question to ask the two of you.\u201d Bu Fang interrupted Tang Yin who was about to reply and said, \u201cDo you know whether there\u2019s an ingredient far superior than this Thunderfire Spirit Pig in the surrounding area?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Relatively speaking, it was also an ingredient with the highest grade. If they wanted to find an ingredient of a higher grade than the Thunderfire Spirit Pig, they would need to enter the inner layer of the Wildlands.The inner layer of the Wildlands was an extremely dangerous place to them. Tang Yin was a sixth grade Battle-Emperor while Lu Xiaoxiao was only a fifth grade Battle-King. If they entered the inner layer at their level, there was very little chance for them to survive if they encountered any spirit beast.The reason was the weakest of the spirit beasts within the inner layer was already sixth grade, while seventh and even eighth grade spirit beasts could be occasionally encountered.When Bu Fang noticed something was strange about Tang Yin\u2019s expression, he realized Tang Yin knew where to find ingredients with higher quality.\u201cIf you tell me the information about the ingredients or guide me there, I\u2019ll cook for you free of charge,\u201d Bu Fang earnestly said.Tang Yin scoffed at Bu Fang\u2019s words and did not take him seriously. If Tang Yin was not awed by Bu Fang when the latter killed the Thunderfire Spirit Pig with a single blow, he would have already left with Lu Xiaoxiao. Guiding Bu Fang to the inner layer was a perilous task. He did not believe Bu Fang\u2019s dishes would be more precious than his life.Just when Tang Yin was somewhat hesitant, Lu Xiaoxiao glanced at her senior brother and suddenly said, \u201cSecond brother, isn\u2019t there a spirit beast within the Valley of the Fallen Phoenix? Master told us to give it a try if we have the capability or choose the Thunderfire Spirit Pig if we don\u2019t. That spirit beast should be an ingredient of a higher grade than the Thunderfire Spirit Pig, right?\u201dLu Xiaoxiao\u2019s eyes were curved like crescent moons, while her adorable smile was accompanied by charming dimples in her cheeks.Tang Yin knitted his eyebrows together as his gaze fell on his junior sister. He did not expect Lu Xiaoxiao to mention the spirit beast within the Valley of the Fallen Phoenix at this time.\u201cHmm? A spirit beast of a higher grade than the Thunderfire Spirit Pig? Alright, bring me there to have a look,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly said.Tang Yin wanted to explain something, but the moment the words reached his mouth, Lu Xiaoxiao clinged onto his arm and pulled him away while walking forward.\u201cSecond brother, with our senior\u2019s ability, he can help us get rid of that spirit beast! Without that spirit beast, we\u2019ll be able to harvest the Phoenix Blood Herb inside of the valley! Then, we\u2019ll be able to complete master\u2019s mission!\u201d Lu Xiaoxiao whispered to Tang Yin.\u201cWouldn\u2019t we be taking advantage of our senior? We can\u2019t do this\u2026 We need to explain things to him properly,\u201d Tang Yin said with a frown as he gave his impish junior sister a dissatisfied look.\u201cSecond brother, what if our senior refused to go if we told him the truth? He\u2019s looking for a high grade ingredient anyway, and that spirit beast is certainly of a higher grade than the Thunderfire Spirit beast!\u201d Lu Xiaoxiao said as she anxiously pulled Tang Yin\u2019s arm while walking forward.Tang Yin faltered for a moment and was struggling internally. Finally, he sighed and said, \u201cWhen the time comes, we\u2019ll have to work hard and help our senior to get rid of that spirit beast.\u201d\u201cOf course! That\u2019s a given!\u201d When Tang Yin finally agreed, Lu Xiaoxiao delightedly smiled and her charming dimples appeared once more.As Bu Fang was following behind them while carrying his bundle, he was naturally unaware of their conversation.The corpse of the Thunderfire Spirit Pig was already kept by Tang Yin. He must have been carrying a Spatial Spirit Tool as he managed to put away the corpse just by waving his arm.\u201cSenior, that spirit beast is located at the Valley of the Fallen Phoenix. There\u2019s quite a distance between this place and the valley, so we\u2019ll have to travel throughout the night to get there earlier,\u201d Tang Yin said.Bu Fang expressionlessly nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, we just need to reach there by tomorrow afternoon.\u201dThe system gave Bu Fang two days to capture the ingredient. According to Tang Yin\u2019s words, Bu Fang was not anxious.The three of them traveled within the dense forest. This forest was an extremely vast region within the Wildlands. Once in a while, they would encounter third and fourth grade spirit beasts and Tang Yin would immediately slaughter them. There was no need for Bu Fang to help out.After the three of them traveled for a while, they finally walked out of the dense forest and entered a stone forest. Countless amount of gravel littered the floor of this wasteland.\u201cOnce we\u2019ve crossed this stone forest, we\u2019ll reach the Valley of the Fallen Phoenix\u2026 Senior, why don\u2019t we rest here for the night?\u201d Tang Yin said to Bu Fang with a smile.Lu Xiaoxiao also hurriedly said, \u201cThat\u2019s right, senior! Let\u2019s have a rest! I am so tired!\u201d\u201cThe Wildlands is very dangerous at night. Even though senior is very powerful, we should still rest for the night for the sake of safety. Why don\u2019t we continue tomorrow?\u201dBu Fang looked up and saw that the sky had already gone dark. He nodded and said, \u201cLet\u2019s rest for the night. I promised that I would cook for you if you\u2019re willing to guide me. I need you to give me a piece of the Thunderfire Spirit Pig\u2019s spinal meat.\u201dThe three of them found a tranquil spot hidden behind a large boulder.Bu Fang went into the forest and returned with some dry wood. He turned to Tang Yin and asked, \u201cDo you know how to build a fire?\u201dTang Yin was stunned for a moment. He thought, \u201cThis\u2026 Is senior really planning to cook for us?\u201d He kept thinking Bu Fang was just joking around with them. He did not think that Bu Fang was actually going to cook for them.Lu Xiaoxiao was slightly surprised as well, then she became somewhat suspicious. \u201cThis senior\u2026 Is he really a chef? He\u2019s not the kind of unreliable chef like our master, right?\u201d\u201cYou, build a fire and give me a piece of the Thunderfire Spirit Pig\u2019s spinal meat. I have to process it,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly said.Tang Yin hurriedly took out a piece of the Thunderfire Spirit Pig\u2019s spinal meat from his Spatial Spirit Tool and handed it over to Bu Fang.Bu Fang took the spinal meat. He found a piece of rock and used true energy to clean its surface. Once the rock was properly cleaned, he took out a gourd filled with spring water and washed the Thunderfire Spirit Pig\u2019s spinal meat. He rinsed the meat to remove the excess blood and allow the spirit energy within the spring water to permeate the surface of the meat.After Bu Fang evaporated the water on the meat\u2019s surface with true energy, he conjured the Dragon Bone Kitchen Knife with a wave of his hand. The pitch-black kitchen knife whirled around a few times on his palm. Then Bu Fang used the knife to slice the meat into three large pieces.Lu Xiaoxiao was speechlessly staring at Bu Fang. Bu Fang\u2019s gorgeous and dazzling cutting technique was still replaying in her mind. She was somewhat confused by the situation. Was this senior really a professional chef?Nearby, Tang Yin had already built a fire. Having a sixth grade Battle-Emperor to build a fire was like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.Bu Fang picked up some tree branches and sharpened the ends. A strange fragrance was emanating from the twig.After skewering the pieces of meat with the tree branches, Bu Fang built a stand over the fire that Tang Yin made. He placed the skewered meat onto the stand to be slowly roasted.Three pieces of meat skewered by tree branches were neatly placed onto the grill and roasted by the fire.\u201cSenior\u2026 Your actions looked really skillful. You looked just like a chef,\u201d Tang Yin said, not knowing how to react. So, Bu Fang was really planning to cook for them.Bu Fang glanced at him and said, \u201cI am a chef.\u201dAfter Bu Fang finished speaking, he took out various bottles filled with seasonings like salt, pepper, cumin powder, etc.Looking at the bottles, Tang Yin and Lu Xiaoxiao were completely speechless. They thought, \u201cSo, you really were a chef?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAs expected of our senior\u2026 Coming to the Wildlands is like having a picnic for you. You even prepared seasoning,\u201d Lu Xiaoxiao said with a dry chuckle.Bu Fang said, \u201cIf it isn\u2019t for the fact that it wasn\u2019t allowed, I would\u2019ve brought the other kitchen tools as well. Then, I would\u2019ve been able to cook even more delicious dishes. You guys are unlucky.\u201dLu Xiaoxiao and Tang Yin could only speechlessly stare at Bu Fang.For a while, no one said anything and the surrounding became quiet. They could only hear the sound of the firewood burning.Within the terrifying silence, the rich fragrance of meat soon began to waft through the air.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As the temperature rose, the tree branches would release an enticing aroma. The aroma was unlike the smell of meat. It was similar to the captivating fragrance of fresh fruit.An alluring rosiness gradually appeared on the meat as it was being roasted by the flames. Oil soon permeated from the meat, while a faint amount of electricity continuously jumped about on the surface.Bu Fang skillfully rotated the meat to ensure that every spot was evenly heated. This was a test of the chef\u2019s control over the heat. Rotisserie looked simple at a glance but there were many small techniques involved in the process.As the meat belonged to the sixth grade Thunderfire Spirit Pig, ordinary flames naturally had no effect on it. Therefore, Bu Fang had to inject his true energy into the fire all the time. This was actually considered a style of true energy culinary.As the roasting time increased, the rich fragrance of meat was wafting out from the grill and drifting within the stone forest.Tang Yin and Lu Xiaoxiao swallowed their salivas at the same time without prior agreement, and their eyes involuntarily drifted toward the meat. That extremely rosy meat roasted by Bu Fang was glittering with oil and exuding tremendous charm.\u201cIt smells really aromatic!\u201d Tang Yin could not restrain himself as he exclaimed. The smell of the meat was mellow but not greasy and was even mixed with a faint fruity fragrance. It gave him an inescapable feeling of euphoria.Lu Xiaoxiao was already staring at the roast meat, and her eyes were unable to move away. Having spent their lives cultivating within the Celestial Arcanum Sect, how could they resist such a rich fragrance?Within the sect, those who became fifth grade Battle-Kings would usually choose to fast. Their need for eating food was extremely small.Bu Fang expressionlessly rotated the meat. As the oil started to drip from the roast meat, he would sprinkle some seasonings on it and the aroma of the meat would immediately become even more rich and diverse.Taking down two of the skewers, Bu Fang gave them to Tang Yin and Lu Xiaoxiao and beckoned them to start tasting.\u201cBu Clan\u2019s Secret Recipe Roast Meat, please enjoy,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly said.Tang Yin and Lu Xiaoxiao were almost drooling. As they were smelling the aroma of the roast meat from a close distance, their appetites were whetted and they were eager to have a taste.\u201cThank you very much, senior.\u201d Tang Yin was still quite self-disciplined. He thanked Bu Fang before he took a bite out of the roast meat.Even though Lu Xiaoxiao was a woman, her table manners were not as refined as Tang Yin\u2019s. When Tang Yin was having his first bite, her mouth was already stuffed with roast meat.\u201cOh, oh\u2026 Hot! Hot!\u201d Lu Xiaoxiao\u2019s cheeks were stuffed with food and her eyes were opened wide. She tightly held onto the roast meat with one hand while continuously fanning her cheeks with the other hand.Tang Yin took his first bite of the roast meat. During the instant his teeth made contact with the meat, a rich flavor burrowed into his mouth. The meat was surprisingly tender and was missing the dryness and hardness that roast meat should possess. As he bit down, the oil seeped out and smeared his lips. When seen from afar, it was like a layer of lipstick was applied.As Tang Yin chewed the roast meat within his mouth, the succulent meat was covering his tongue and a numbing sensation was secreting from the meat. It was stimulating his mouth and causing goosebumps to appear all over his body.After swallowing the roast meat, the numbing sensation traveled down his esophagus and into his stomach. It felt as if his entire body was being cleaned and it was so comfortable that he wanted to moan out loud.\u201cHow could such a delicious taste exist in this world! I didn\u2019t know that the meat of the Thunderfire Spirit Pig could be this delicious!\u201d Tang Yin suddenly felt an impulse to shed tears. After living for so long, it was the first time he had eaten food that emotionally moved him.Lu Xiaoxiao had already reached a point where she could not stop eating. Her eyes were red. She was evidently emotionally moved by the delicious taste as well.As a disciple belonging to one of the top ten sects outside of the border, the Celestial Arcanum Sect, they had to undergo arduous training since they were young. They ate plain congee and steamed buns for three meals a day over a dozen years. Once their cultivation level reached fifth grade, most of them would choose to fast. Therefore, they had no concept of taste.Eating the roast meat made by Bu Fang for the first time was simply an indescribable shock to them. It was the kind of taste that could enter the depths of their hearts.Bu Fang expressionlessly watched as the two of them continued to eat with no signs of stopping and the corners of his mouth widened into a smile. Then he took the last skewer as well and leisurely began tasting.As he ate, he was also attempting to look for flaws existing within the roast meat.Swoosh!As the wind blew, the aroma of the roast meat gradually spread into the surroundings. The smell of the roast meat was especially conspicuous within the Wildlands. Many spirit beasts were subconsciously attracted toward their location by the fragrance.Above a craggy boulder, a cheetah-like demonic beast with dark green eyes glowing in the dark was baring its teeth and drooling from its mouth, while staring in the direction of Bu Fang\u2019s camp.Meanwhile, there were also a few other powerful auras belonging to spirit beasts swiftly approaching them.The smell of the roast meat was not only a temptation toward humans, it was clearly an aroma that was hard to resist for spirit beasts as well.Tang Yin took a bite of the roast meat and swallowed it into his stomach with a gulp. He had a satisfied expression as he stood up.\u201cSenior\u2019s culinary skill has really astounded me. Let me take care of the little things in the surroundings, so as not to affect your mood.\u201d Tang Yin pulled out his longsword with one hand while holding the roast meat with the other. The sharpness of the longsword exuded a numbing coldness.Bu Fang was expressionlessly eating his roast meat while pondering the flaws within it.Lu Xiaoxiao was also fully concentrated on dealing with the roast meat.When Tang Yin realized that no one was paying attention to him, he suddenly felt really embarrassed. He grinned and take another bite of roast meat. With a chuckle, the true energy within his body suddenly burst out and wrapped around his body like a dragon.\u201cHahahaha! In the past, there were heroes who drank wine while slaying demons! Now, there\u2019s I, Tang Yin, who ate meat while butchering beasts!\u201dTang Yin\u2019s figure instantly charged into the midst of the approaching spirit beasts. The strength of these spirit beasts, who were attracted by the smell of the roast meat, were all approximately fifth grade. They were all rulers of their own regions. If it was not for the overwhelming temptation of the roast meat, they would never leave their own territory.As his sword flashed in the darkness, Tang Yin effortlessly moved about in the midst of the numerous spirit beasts in a relaxed manner with his clothes fluttering about. He would occasionally take a bite of the roast meat as he fought to his heart\u2019s content while maintaining his composure.Naturally, there was something strange with the spectacle of someone eating roast meat while battling spirit beasts\u2026After the battle was over, Tang Yin returned with one hand holding his sword and the other holding the roast meat.There was still blood dripping from his ice-cold longsword, but Tang Yin was eating the roast meat with indifference. There was an indescribable look of satisfaction on his face, mixed with a trace of astonishment.\u201cSenior, the spirit beasts have all been dealt with,\u201d Tang Yin said with a chuckle.Bu Fang nodded as he placed the last piece of roast meat in his mouth and slowly chewed it.\u201cSenior, is your roast meat\u2026 capable of replenishing true energy? Even though I was fighting against four fifth grade spirit beasts on my own, not only did I feel my true energy was not depleting, I was getting stronger as the fight progressed. My true energy was nearly overflowing from my body\u2026\u201d Tang Yin took a deep breath and solemnly asked.Nearby, Lu Xiaoxiao had a satisfied expression after eating her fill and was rubbing her bloated belly. She exhaled a breath of hot air and was planning to rest for a while.However, her eyes widened in surprise in the next moment. She glanced at Tang Yin, then sat down with her legs crossed. A dense amount of true energy was surging within her body. She actually entered a cultivating state.\u201cAs you can see, this roast meat can provide enough true energy to you. Don\u2019t make such a big fuss, this is just an ordinary true energy cuisine. If you still wish to taste food like this, you can come to the imperial city of the Light Wind Empire and look for Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store,\u201d Bu Fang simply said. At the same time, he advertised for his store.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLight Wind Empire, Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store\u2026 Tang Yin narrowed his eyes and solemnly nodded. He thought, \u201cA serving of delicious food that is comparable to a single fifth grade elixir, our senior is indeed enigmatic!\u201dThen, after eating finished the roast meat, Tang Yin sat down with his legs crossed and began cultivating as well. Since the system had already extracted the true energy within his food, Bu Fang found a spot and went to sleep.The night passed without incident. The next day, as the sun just rose above the horizon, the three of them set off toward the Valley of the Fallen Phoenix.After passing through the stone forest, the scenery before their eyes changed.In front of them was a trickling stream surrounded by a lush undergrowth. The sound of a cascading waterfall resounded in their ears. The Valley of the Fallen Phoenix was right before their eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After passing through the stone forest, a single step was like stepping into paradise. There were many unusual treasures growing within the valley and precious medicinal ingredients could be found everywhere. The strong medicinal aroma emanating from within the valley was almost forming a multi-colored curtain as it hovered in the skies.\u201cThis is truly a wondrous location,\u201d Bu Fang said. Only such a beautiful scenery could correspond with the fantasy world in Bu Fang\u2019s heart. After arriving at the Hidden Dragon Continent so long ago, this was the first time Bu Fang felt the marvel of the fantasy world.\u201cDidn\u2019t you guys say there\u2019s a spirit beast with a higher grade than the Thunderfire Spirit Pig? Where is it?\u201d Bu Fang asked. After he finished praising the scenery, his thoughts once again went back to the matter of the ingredient.\u201cSenior, that spirit beast is hiding inside the valley! We need to enter before we can meet it.\u201d Before Tang Yin could reply, Lu Xiaoxiao responded to Bu Fang\u2019s question first.Tang Yin was frowning as he swept his gaze toward his junior sister. He turned to Bu Fang and said, \u201cSenior, the interior of the Valley of the Fallen Phoenix is not safe because of the uniqueness of its location\u2026 There might even be seventh grade spirit beasts in there.\u201dSince the Valley of the Fallen Phoenix was located at the boundary between the outskirts and inner layer, there was a possibility of seventh grade spirit beasts appearing\u2026\u201cOh\u2026 Seventh grade spirit beasts? That should be considered as an ingredient of a higher grade than the Thunderfire Spirit Pig,\u201d Bu Fang indifferently said.Tang Yin was dumbfounded.As expected of his senior, even a seventh grade spirit beast was only an ingredient in his eyes\u2026 Tang Yin\u2019s admiration toward Bu Fang has simply reached the point of worship.Even a human seventh grade Battle-Saint would find fighting against a seventh grade spirit to be an arduous task. However, in the mouth of his senior, the so-called seventh grade spirit beast was only food. How awe-inspiring!Most impressive, my senior!With Tang Yin leading the way, the three of them passed through the stone forest and stepped into the Valley of the Fallen Phoenix.Within the serene valley, lush vegetation was growing everywhere. At a single glance, they could only see green. However, within this greenery, they could occasionally spot a few thickets of flowers beautifully blooming in this winter.Even though it was winter, the Valley of the Phoenix seemed to be in a different world. There was no cold winter winds or falling snow. The inside of the verdant valley was exuding a warm wetness and was extremely comfortable.This was also the first time Tang Yin and Lu Xiaoxiao stepped into the Valley of the Fallen Phoenix. Their eyes were filled with curiosity as they looked around.\u201cSecond brother! Look, it\u2019s a Butterfly Leaf Herb! A third grade spirit herb!\u201d Lu Xiaoxiao suddenly exclaimed when she saw an herb that resembled the wings of a butterfly.Furthermore, it was not just the Butterfly Leaf Herb. Within the valley, there were all sorts of precious herbs growing all over the place. At the very least, the herbs used in the Sage Herb Phoenix Chicken Soup could be seen everywhere.As the thunderous sound of a waterfall resounded in their ears, the three of them picked the herbs while following a small path. They soon came before a waterfall.As a strong wind mixed with water vapor blew past them, their sleeves and the edges of their clothes flapped violently. Their eyes were squinting as they looked forward.\u201cHmm? Is that a Sage Herb?\u201d Bu Fang raised his eyebrows as he looked toward a touch of purple foliage near the edge of the waterfall. The Sage Herb was beneath the foliage.\u201cCorrect, that\u2019s the fifth grade spirit herb, Heavenly Sage Herb. I didn\u2019t think the Valley of the Fallen Phoenix would even have Sage Herb!\u201d Tang Yin took a deep breath and was rather happy as he said.Bu Fang nodded and started walking forward. He would naturally not miss such an opportunity to acquire the Sage Herb which he was very familiar with. Especially when the value of the herb was indisputable and it was a rare delicacy as well.Just as Bu Fang was only a few meters away from the Heavenly Sage Herb, he knitted his eyebrows together as the sound of an object sailing through the air reached his ears.Bu Fang\u2019s expression remained unchanged. As he waved his arm, the unassuming Golden Dragon Bone Kitchen Knife immediately appeared in his hand and was swung toward the swiftly approaching figure.During the instant the Dragon Bone Kitchen Knife appeared, the body of the approaching figure suddenly stiffened and was immediately hewed into two halves by Bu Fang\u2019s kitchen knife.Bright red blood spilled onto the floor, while the figure that was split in two was convulsing on the ground.\u201cHiss\u2026\u201d When Tang Yin saw the scene, he sucked in a breath of cold air.That was a fifth grade spirit beast, the Phantom Spearhead Viper! It was one of the most troublesome among the fifth grade spirit beasts!After Bu Fang slayed the viper, he twirled the kitchen knife in his hand. There was neither dust nor blood on the blade. It turned into a wisp of green smoke and returned into the mark on Bu Fang\u2019s wrist once more.He pulled out the Sage Herb. The plump herb was filled with a dense amount of spirit energy. Even though it was slightly inferior to the Sage Herb provided by the system, it was still much better than the one provided by the crown prince.\u201cSystem, can\u2019t you provide me with some kind of storage function? You can\u2019t be expecting me to carry the spirit herbs around with my bare hands, right? The ingredient I am going to capture might just be an enormous creature. Even if I manage to capture it, I won\u2019t be able to bring it back,\u201d Bu Fang said to the system.The system did not immediately reply and was silent for a while.\u201cDimensional bag function is being activated. Countdown until activation, 3, 2, 1\u2026 Activation completed. The host may now use the dimensional bag function.\u201d The system\u2019s solemn voice rang out.The corners of Bu Fang\u2019s mouth widened into a smile. As he exerted his will, the Sage Herb in his hand was stored into the dimensional bag. The capacity of the dimensional bag provided by the system was not small. The space inside was around the size of the store.After storing the Sage Herb and a few other miscellaneous items into the dimensional bag, Bu Fang\u2019s eyebrows were knitted together as his gaze landed on Tang Yin once more.\u201cWhere\u2019s the high quality ingredient you mentioned?\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly asked.\u201cSenior, please wait\u2026 That spirit beast is right inside this valley!\u201d Tang Yin hurriedly replied. He did not dare to irritate Bu Fang. Along the way, the unfathomable feeling coming from Bu Fang was terrifying him.\u201cSecond brother! Look! That\u2019s\u2026 Phoenix Blood Herb?!\u201dSuddenly, Lu Xiaoxiao, who was standing next to Yang Yin, excitedly shouted while pointing toward a small hill next to the waterfall.Phoenix Blood Herb? What was that? Bu Fang knitted his eyebrows together as he looked toward the direction Lu Xiaoxiao was pointing. He saw a blood red herb that resembled the tail feather of a phoenix atop a small hill swaying along with the wind. A dense amount of spirit energy was emanating from the herb.\u201cPhoenix Blood Herb is a seventh grade spirit herb. According to legends, it\u2019s a herb that mutated after coming in contact with the blood of the Ancient Phoenix. Those who consume the herb will gain the chance to rise from the ashes and succeed after failure. This is an excellent ingredient for the Elixir Cuisine. The system suggests acquiring this ingredient.\u201dBu Fang\u2019s eyes lit up. The Phoenix Blood Herb seemed pretty good from the looks of it.\u201cThis Phoenix Blood Herb is just about to mature. When the time comes, the spirit beasts hiding within the valley would probably all appear\u2026 Senior, that spirit beast you\u2019re seeking will appear as well.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThe Phoenix Blood Herb is a good thing. I didn\u2019t think there would be an unexpected gift as well,\u201d Bu Fang said with a smile. The Phoenix Blood Herb swaying along with the wind was becoming more beautiful. The thick spirit energy was spreading to the surroundings and forming a cloud of white mist.When Lu Xiaoxiao heard Bu Fang\u2019s words, her expression immediately changed. She asked, \u201cSenior\u2026 Are you going to take the Phoenix Blood Herb as well?\u201dBu Fang knitted his eyebrows together and puzzledly turned his head toward her. He looked at her and asked, \u201cIs there anything wrong with that?\u201dAfter hearing his reply, Lu Xiaoxiao\u2019s expression became unpleasant. At the same time, a series of powerful spirit energy fluctuations emanated from within the valley and terrifying auras were continuously leaking out.Suddenly, Tang Yin\u2019s expression changed. As he looked around, he saw a horde of bestial figures had gathered in their surroundings without their realization\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A macabre atmosphere pervaded the entire valley. Within the herd of bestial figures, there was at least a few hundred spirit beasts.Tang Yin\u2019s complexion had become extremely pale. As his gaze swept over the bestial figures, his eyes were filled with despair.He did not think\u2026 He really did not think that the temptation of the Phoenix Blood Herb would be so great that the spirit energy released when it was about to mature would actually attract so many spirit beasts.There was a disparity in the strength of the spirit beasts. They were mostly fifth grade spirit beasts, but there were over a dozen sixth grade spirit beasts among them as well. With this kind of line-up, Tang Yin would not be able to survive even if there were ten of him.\u201cSe\u2026 Second brother\u2026 Why is this happening? Why are there so many spirit beasts? I\u2026 I don\u2019t want to die here!\u201d As Lu Xiaoxiao\u2019s large eyes swept across these spirit beasts, both of her legs suddenly started to tremble.If she knew there were so many spirit beasts hiding within the Valley of the Fallen Phoenix\u2026 She would never have come!On the other hand, there was not much change in Bu Fang\u2019s expression. He only slightly frowned as he scanned the surrounding spirit beasts in astonishment.\u201cThe Phoenix Blood Herb is filled with a dense amount of spirit energy and has a huge enhancement effect to the evolution of the spirit beasts. Therefore, its attractiveness to the spirit beasts is tremendous,\u201d Tang Yin solemnly said as his gaze landed on Bu Fang.\u201cSenior. If you manage to escape, I hope you would bring the news about our deaths back to our sect.\u201d Tang Yin had fallen into despair and his voice was filled with helplessness.Lu Xiaoxiao was already lying limply on the ground while crying like a pearblossom moistened by raindrops[1]. She really regretted her reckless decision to enter the valley. Suddenly, Lu Xiaoxiao seemed to have recalled something. She looked toward Bu Fang with hope in her eyes while still sobbing.\u201cSenior\u2026 With your capabilities, you must have a way of saving us, right?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you guys want the Phoenix Blood Herb as well?\u201d Bu Fang asked as he indifferently looked at Lu Xiaoxiao.Lu Xiaoxiao\u2019s expression immediately stiffened as she blankly stared at Bu Fang. She watched as a wisp of green smoke emerged from Bu Fang\u2019s hand and that unassuming kitchen knife appeared in his hand.\u201cDon\u2019t take me for a fool. You were trying to use me from the beginning. It\u2019s true that there are spirit beasts here, but you only wanted to make use of me to get rid of them. Then, it would be easier for you to acquire that Phoenix Blood Herb, right?\u201dThe corners of Bu Fang\u2019s mouth widened and revealed a mocking smile as he looked toward the bewildered Lu Xiaoxiao.When Tang Yin heard Bu Fang\u2019s words, he suddenly sighed. He realized that Bu Fang had figured out their intent from the beginning. However, Bu Fang might not have minded earlier on since his objective was capturing the spirit beasts as ingredients. However, at the current moment, they had already fallen into a crisis. In this sort of situation, Bu Fang had no reason to be courteous any longer.Tang Yin was feeling helpless as well. His junior sister, Lu Xiaoxiao, was actually not that bad of a person. The thing was she happened to be a crafty person. Normally, it was still fine since she was within the sect. However, once she was outside, it was easy to offend others with her ploys\u2026\u201cDo you guys still want the Phoenix Blood Herb?\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly asked.At the moment, Lu Xiaoxiao\u2019s heart was already in her mouth. When she heard Bu Fang\u2019s question, she hurriedly replied while shaking her head, \u201cI don\u2019t want it anymore! I don\u2019t want it anymore!\u201dBetween her life and the Phoenix Blood Herb, Lu Xiaoxiao chose her own life without any hesitation.Tang Yin was dazed for a moment, then suddenly became overjoyed as he excitedly asked, \u201cDoes senior have a method of resolving this perilous situation?\u201dAs expected of his senior\u2026 This sort of situation might be a desperate situation for them. However, that was not the case for that unfathomable senior, Bu Fang.Bu Fang glanced at him and was just about to nod his head, when he discovered the bestial horde in their surroundings were getting restless.Rumble!An intense tremor occurred in both the left and right directions, then the sound of trees breaking rang out. Two gigantic figures walked out and their terrifying aura pressed down on the entire valley.Tang Yin\u2019s complexion suddenly became deathly pale\u2026 His eyes were fixated on the two figures that just appeared. The hope that had just arisen was destroyed once more.\u201cTwo seventh grade spirit beasts\u2026 It\u2019s over, we\u2019re done for.\u201dLu Xiaoxiao broke out in tears once more. The hope that had just arisen was suddenly crushed. The difference between her expectation and the result had caused her mental breakdown.When Bu Fang looked to his right at the gigantic bovine figure whose entire body was ignited in light red flames, his eyes suddenly lit up with an intense brightness.\u201cWhat a fellow\u2026 This ingredient is far better than the Thunderfire Spirit Pig!\u201dThere were two seventh grade spirit beasts. On the right side was the seventh grade Wandering Dragon Cow whose body was enveloped by everlasting flames. It possesses the head of a cow and the tail of a dragon, and its breathing sounded like the rumble of thunder.The spirit beast on the left was seventh grade as well. It was a gigantic Spirit Ape with golden fur all over its body.Tang Yin knew there was a seventh grade Wandering Dragon Cow within the valley. However, he did not know there was a Spirit Ape as well. With two seventh grade spirit beasts guarding the valley, Tang Yin would never dare to enter even if he was given a hundred times the courage.No matter how powerful his senior was, how could he handle two seventh grade spirit beasts at once? Even a seventh grade Battle-Saint would flee in panic if these two spirit beasts were encountered.Rumble!With the Wandering Dragon Cow\u2019s roar, the entire valley seemed to be trembling and continued to shake. The Spirit Ape bared its teeth and started screeching in response. The auras of the two immediately started opposing each other with equal ferocity.The Phoenix Blood Herb atop of the small hill was swaying even more rapidly and the spirit energy leaking out was becoming even more intense. Vaguely, there seemed to be a phoenix rising from the ashes and attempting to ascend into the skies.The Phoenix Blood Herb was about to mature.Tang Yin and Lu Xiaoxiao were close to despair as well.They understood that the entire valley would turn into a battlefield for the two seventh grade spirit beasts once the Phoenix Blood Herb matured. When that time comes, they would definitely be torn into pieces by the enraged spirit beasts.Bu Fang ignored the others. Like the two seventh grade spirit beasts, his gaze was fixated on the Phoenix Blood Herb, the spirit herb that was precious enough to bring about the battle between two seventh grade spirit beasts.The water plummeted from the top of the waterfall and smashed into the plunge pool below with a loud noise. Suddenly, within that single moment, the entire valley became absolutely quiet. The deafening silence was disturbing.The thunderous roar of the waterfall disappeared. The breathing noise of the Wandering Dragon Cow also disappeared. The screeching of the Spirit Ape could not be heard as well. The entire valley seemed to have turned into a restricted zone for sound.Atop the small hill, the Phoenix Blood Herb was swaying as red specks of light emerged from within. Red spots began to appear on the leaves and the bright red color was just like the color of burning blood. The cry of a phoenix resounded within the entire valley. After the cry ended, all of the sound returned.The Phoenix Blood Herb\u2026 has matured!\u201cMoo!!\u201d The Wandering Dragon Cow roared and its eyes abruptly turned blood red. It suddenly stepped forward with its cow hooves and charged toward the Phoenix Blood Herb. The entire valley was trembling.The other spirit beasts behind the Wandering Dragon Cow bellowed with rage as they rushed out one after another and followed after it.The Spirit Ape suddenly beat its chest with its fist. With a loud screech, it dashed toward the Phoenix Blood Herb as well. The horde of spirit beasts behind it also followed after it.Bu Fang and the other two were located in-between the two approaching stampedes. They were just like a fragile boat made from leaves floating in a vast ocean. In front of these gigantic spirit beasts, it seemed as if they would be stomped into minced meat at any moment.Tang Yin and Lu Xiaoxiao had already closed their eyes in despair.Bu Fang expressionlessly swept his gaze over the spirit beasts that were rapidly approaching them from two different directions and leisurely lifted up the Golden Dragon Bone Kitchen Knife. As he raised the kitchen knife over his head, the true energy within his body immediately burst out and flowed into the Golden Dragon Bone Kitchen Knife.A golden radiance blossomed intensely like the sun and was extremely glaring. A gigantic, golden kitchen knife was hoisted over Bu Fang\u2019s shoulder. The boundless aura of a dragon, with Bu Fang in the center, suddenly spread in all directions and turned into a ripple.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIn the next moment, the stampede of spirit beasts abruptly stopped and laid on the ground in panic.Once the knife is drawn, all beasts shall submit!The Golden Dragon Bone Kitchen Knife from the God of Cooking Set\u2026 was just that overbearing!\u2014[1] Pearblossom moistened by raindrops (\u68a8\u82b1\u5e26\u96e8) \u2013 Originated from The Song of Everlasting Regret by Bai Juyi, this was originally used to describe Yang Guifei\u2019s beautiful appearance even while she was crying, but was later used to describe a woman\u2019s charm.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It instantly expanded and made all of the spirit beasts lie down on the ground. The spirit beasts that were under fifth grade were all shivering from the effects of the aura.The spirit beasts were a species with a very strict hierarchy. They worshipped the strong but also feared them as well. The suppression effect of higher grade spirit beasts toward lower grade spirit beasts was very clear. Therefore, the spirit beasts clearly divided their territories within the Wildlands.This was the reason for the existence of the outskirts, inner layer, and central zone within the Wildlands.The aura of the dragons was contained within the Golden Dragon Bone Kitchen Knife. The dragon race had always been standing atop the food chain of the spirit beasts. They looked down upon the spirit beasts and ruled over them. They had the power to suppress any spirit beast.Therefore, Bu Fang lifted up the Golden Dragon Bone Kitchen Knife, injected his true energy, and activated the current form of the Golden Dragon Bone Kitchen Knife. That blinding golden radiance, accompanied with the surging golden dragon\u2019s aura, directly forced all of the spirit beasts within the Valley of the Fallen Phoenix to lie down on the ground. Even the Spirit Ape and the Wandering Dragon Cow were no exceptions.A violent wind spread into the surroundings with Bu Fang in the center, causing his hair to flutter and his clothes to make flapping noises. He was carrying the gigantic Golden Dragon Bone Kitchen Knife with his head held high as he expressionlessly swept his eyes over all of the spirit beasts.Even though the Wandering Dragon Cow was a seventh grade spirit beast, the suppressive effect of the Golden Dragon Bone Kitchen Knife was much stronger toward it than the other spirit beasts. The reason was the dash of dragon\u2019s blood flowing in its veins. Therefore, when facing the authentic aura of the dragon race, it could only lie on the ground while shivering.Tang Yin had already closed his eyes in despair. However, he suddenly realized the surroundings seemed to have quieted down and getting trampled by the stampede of beasts did not happen. He suddenly opened his eyes in puzzlement and immediately saw a scene that he would never forget for the rest of his life.Lu Xiaoxiao\u2019s frightened face was also filled with astonishment. There was still some remnants of tears on her face. Her mouth was slightly opened as she blankly stared at Bu Fang, who stood a distance away while holding a gigantic golden kitchen knife.The area around them was filled with prostrating spirit beasts\u2026\u201cThis\u2026 What\u2019s going on?! Senior\u2026\u201d Tang Yin\u2019s mouth felt somewhat dry. Just what was he witnessing? What exactly was going on?The spirit beasts, including the two seventh grade spirit beasts, were all actually prostrating in front of that senior. He\u2026 was actually this powerful?!Was he subduing a horde of spirit beasts by purely relying on his aura? Was this the senior\u2019s actual strength?Tang Yin\u2019s awe grew even more. He only felt Bu Fang was unfathomable and was even more impressive than his own sect leader\u2026 At least, his sect leader was unable to make spirit beasts prostrate.At the moment, Bu Fang, who was only a fourth grade Battle-Spirit, was suddenly as imposing as an eighth grade War-God in his eyes.Bu Fang was carrying the kitchen knife over his shoulders as his eyes turned toward Tang Yin, whose expression was constantly changing. He puzzledly frowned and said, \u201cAre you guys still not going to run?\u201d\u201cAh?!\u201d Tang Yin blankly replied.\u201cIf I were you, I would immediately run away and never look back. I would run as far as possible,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly said.Tang Yin suddenly sucked in a breath of cold air. He immediately understood Bu Fang\u2019s meaning. Their senior was creating a chance for them to escape! Otherwise, with their senior\u2019s unfathomable cultivation level, he would have already started slaughtering those spirit beasts! Where would he have the time to care for them!He felt an indescribable feeling in his chest!Tang Yin clenched his teeth and helped the bewildered Lu Xiaoxiao up. He respectfully kowtowed toward Bu Fang and solemnly said, \u201cSenior, I\u2019ll never be able to repay your kindness for saving our lives today. Senior\u2026 please take care!\u201d\u201cAlright, hurry up and go. Oh, remember to visit Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store at the Light Wind Empire when you have the time. The food there is pretty good and the price is extremely affordable as well,\u201d Bu Fang indifferently said.Tang Yin was surprised for a moment, then earnestly nodded and was about to leave while pulling Lu Xiaoxiao along.\u201cAh! Se\u2026 Second brother, what about the Phoenix Blood Herb?!\u201d Lu Xiaoxiao seemed to have just recovered from her shock. When she saw that Tang Yin was actually leaving while pulling her along, she immediately exclaimed in anxiety.\u201cAre you still thinking about the Phoenix Blood Herb? Do you want to die?\u201d Tang Yin was furious! Their senior magnanimously created a chance for them to escape, yet this junior sister of his was still thinking about the Phoenix Blood Herb! She was simply\u2026 unreasonable!At that moment, Lu Xiaoxiao finally realized the situation. Her entire body shivered when she glanced toward that expressionless and unfathomable Bu Fang. Then, without saying a word, she left while following Tang Yin\u2019s pace.When Bu Fang saw the figures of the two had left the Valley of the Fallen Phoenix, his gaze once again shifted toward the spirit beasts in front of him. The true energy within his body which he used to sustain the Golden Dragon Bone Kitchen Knife\u2019s current form was gradually running out\u2026Therefore, Bu Fang no longer hesitated. With one hand grabbing the kitchen knife\u2019s hilt which had a sinister dragon head carved upon it, he suddenly pressed downward and the surging aura was immediately released once more.The horde of spirit beasts lying flat on the ground all shivered\u2026Bu Fang pointed his kitchen knife at the Spirit Ape, lifted his face and indifferently said, \u201cYou\u2019re not suitable to be my ingredient. So\u2026 get lost!\u201dThe figure of the Spirit Ape trembled and immediately bared its teeth toward Bu Fang. However, its eyes were still filled with horror and unwillingness.The Phoenix Blood Herb had already matured. Giving up like this\u2026 As a seventh grade spirit beast that had just become enlightened, it was naturally unwilling to just leave.\u201cHmm? You\u2019re really not leaving?\u201d Bu Fang knitted his eyebrows together. He swung the kitchen knife around a few times and walked toward the Wandering Dragon Cow.The entire head of the Wandering Dragon Cow was buried underneath the ground and its dragon tail was curled up. It was not moving even an inch. As the possessor of the dragon race\u2019s bloodline, it was completely suppressed.Bu Fang did not say anything as he indifferently looked toward the Spirit Ape. Then he swung his kitchen knife and sliced off the Wandering Dragon Cow\u2019s horn like it was tofu\u2026The Wandering Dragon Cow felt wronged\u2026 It thought, \u201cIf you wanted him to leave, shouldn\u2019t you be bothering him? Why are you bullying this cow? You really think cows are easy targets\u2026\u201dAs a long-time rival of the Wandering Dragon Cow, the Spirit Ape naturally knew quite well how hard and sharp its horn was\u2026 However, this horn was actually sliced off with a single swing by this human with a terrifying aura\u2026 It thought, \u201cFine, this good monkey shall not pick a fight with a cunning human like you!\u201dWith a sharp screech, the seventh grade Spirit Ape while filled with reluctance leapt out of the valley with a single bound and instantly vanished.The spirit beasts following the Spirit Ape also receded like tidewater.Using the same method to drive off the spirit beasts behind the Wandering Dragon Cow, the entire valley was only left with Bu Fang, who was carrying the gigantic Golden Dragon Bone Kitchen Knife over his shoulder, and the shivering Wandering Dragon Cow, who was missing a horn\u2026Bu Fang patted the Wandering Dragon Cow\u2019s gigantic body as he clicked his tongue and exclaimed in wonder, \u201cNot bad, this ingredient is far better than the Thunderfire Spirit Pig.\u201dThe Wandering Dragon Cow\u2019s big head was filled with suspicions\u2026 Ingredient? What ingredient?In the next moment, in the eyes of the Wandering Dragon Cow, the Golden Dragon Bone Kitchen gradually grew bigger\u2026 and bigger\u2026 sphhhlt.The true energy within Bu Fang\u2019s body finally ran out and he was unable to sustain the Golden Dragon Bone Kitchen Knife\u2019s current form. It transformed back into its unassuming appearance and disappeared after turning into green smoke.Bu Fang patted the Wandering Dragon Cow\u2019s gigantic body once more. With a wave of his hand, he stored it into the dimensional bag provided by the system.\u201cCongratulations to the host for completing the abrupt mission: carry out the first ingredient capture. The system reward will now be released. After a minute, the return teleportation will be carried out. Would the host please get ready,\u201d the system\u2019s solemn voice resounded within Bu Fang\u2019s mind, just as the corpse of the Wandering Dragon Cow was stored.Bu Fang was startled. Only a minute was left? The Phoenix Blood Herb was still not harvested yet!Above Bu Fang\u2019s head, a speck of light had already appeared. This speck of light was slowly drawing a mysterious teleportation magic array. Regarding this, Bu Fang was already used to it.Bu Fang did not hesitate as he turned around and ran toward the small hill. Above his head, the speck of light was still drawing. As time went by, the magic array was already halfway to completion.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cTen seconds left until return. Begin countdown. Ten\u2026 Nine\u2026\u201dBu Fang was still expressionless, but his anxiety could be seen in his eyes. He was getting closer and closer to the Phoenix Blood Herb, but the countdown was also getting closer to finishing\u2026\u201cJust give me one more second\u2026 I can pry open the entire valley!\u201d Bu Fang shouted in his mind as he leapt with all his strength and grabbed onto the Phoenix Blood Herb that was ascending into the skies like a phoenix. A sharp pain was instantly transmitted from his palm into his mind!However, before he could scream from the pain, the drawing of the magic array was completed. A burst of violent wind emerged and then dissipated\u2026The Valley of the Fallen Phoenix regained its peace once more. The flow of the waterfall continued its natural course.

Then, this speck of light rapidly flew around the air while drawing a magic array. A burst of violent wind cropped up and a figure appeared within the magic array.Bu Fang came back to the store in a trance. He was having dizzy spells as he fell down on his buttocks and gasped for air with deep breaths.\u201cThe host has already returned to the store. The system reward will now be released,\u201d the system\u2019s solemn voice resounded within Bu Fang\u2019s mind.However, Bu Fang ignored the message. His gaze was fixated on the fiery-red herb tightly grasped in his hand. The herb felt extremely hot as he held it within his hand. It was like holding a piece of magma.\u201cThankfully, I still managed to catch it. Otherwise, after toiling for so long, it would be a huge loss if I had missed this seventh grade spirit herb.\u201d The corners of Bu Fang\u2019s mouth widened and a faint smile seemed to appear on his rigid face.The Phoenix Blood Herb was entirely red in color. After maturation, the herb became even more dazzling as if it was carved from an exquisite red agate. On its surface, it was filled with dark red spots as if it was stained with blood.Grasping the herb in his hand, he felt an extreme hotness. However, this hotness was not felt on his skin but in his mind.After finding a jade box, he placed the Phoenix Blood Herb inside. He did not choose to store it within the dimensional bag provided by the system, but kept it within a cupboard.Similarly, he took out the Sage Herb he harvested from within the dimensional bag. This plump Sage Herb was exuding an enticing fragrance.Bu Fang endured the temptation as he placed the Sage Herb into a jade box before storing it into the cupboard as well.After completing all of these actions, only then did Bu Fang heavily breathe out. As he stretched himself, the joints within his body produced popping sounds. Contrary to his expectation, his first ingredient capture was a meaningful experience.\u201cAs expected of the God of Cooking set. Without the Golden Dragon Bone Kitchen Knife, I really wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything. No wonder the system waited until I obtained the God of Cooking set before initiating this ingredient capture mission.\u201d Bu Fang stretched his sore neck as he headed up the stairs.Bu Fang first took a shower. His hair was let loose and water was still dripping off the ends as he returned to his room while feeling more refreshed.After spending two days hunting for ingredients, Bu Fang was feeling tired. It was time for him to have a good sleep.However, before he could go to sleep, he needed to find out more about the mission reward that was newly released by the system.\u201cThe Rice Noodle Roll cooking technique?\u201d Bu Fang narrowed his eyes. He was actually very interested in this new dish. As a chef, he was naturally familiar with the Rice Noodle Roll. After all, this was an extremely delicious breakfast.The Rice Noodle Roll was a type of rice product. It was also known as steamed rice roll, jyu cheung fan, and chee cheong fun. It was considered a relatively simple dish. The main point was making the thin wrappers by steaming the rice milk and then wrapping the freshly stir-fried filling with the thin wrappers.As Bu Fang pondered the Rice Noodle Roll\u2019s cooking method in his mind, he felt an itch to try it out. He was eager to cook the new dish and have a taste. However, after considering for a while, he gave up in the end.The main reason was after expending too much true energy, he was rather tired and feeling somewhat languid. The other reason was that the Rice Noodle Roll was a breakfast dish and waking up earlier to cook it was the best choice.Therefore, Bu Fang endured the impulse to get up and practice the dish. He lay down on his bed and soon fell asleep.The night quietly passed.The next day, Bu Fang got up from bed just as the sun rose, and stretched his body. After washing up, he went into the kitchen and first practiced his cutting technique. His Level One Meteor Cutting Technique was already close to culmination. He would most probably be able to reach culmination after practicing for one more day.After finishing his cutting technique practice, Bu Fang made a plate of Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs. This was Blacky\u2019s daily meal and Bu Fang was extremely experienced with making this dish. Soon, a rich, captivating aroma of meat was wafting within the kitchen.Carrying the plate of Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs to the dining area, Bu Fang opened up the entrance and the cold wind immediately blew into the store. The imperial city of the Light Wind Empire had already officially entered winter. The sky was overcast as if foreshadowing heavy snow.\u201cBlacky, it\u2019s time to eat.\u201d Bu Fang arrived in front of Blacky with the plate of Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs. The gluttonous dog instantly jumped up and excitedly stared at the plate in Bu Fang\u2019s hands with its tongue hanging out.\u201cDeprived of food for two days\u2026 Your lord dog is craving to death!\u201d Blacky thought as his eyes gleamed while staring fixedly at the Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs.That bewitching aroma of the meat was almost causing Blacky to degenerate. When Bu Fang placed the Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs in front it, it eagerly began gobbling down the meat on the plate.It was still the same recipe with the same taste! This\u2026 was the taste of Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs!The corners of Bu Fang\u2019s mouth curled up as he watched Blacky gobble down the food while wagging its tail. He turned around and entered the kitchen. He was about to start cooking the Rice Noodle Roll.He first took out the rice milk prepared by the system. The rice milk was pure white like milk and was exuding a faint fragrance. Evidently, the rice used to make it was not ordinary.He poured the rice milk into a specially-made tray. This tray was not thick, so the height of the rice milk layer was not that high either. It was around two milimeters. After pouring the rice milk, Bu Fang placed the tray onto the steam rack to be cooked.While the rice milk was being steamed, Bu Fang began preparing the filling needed for the Rice Noodle Roll.\u201cPork or beef, shrimp, bok choy, dried radish granules\u2026\u201d Bu Fang muttered as he prepared these ingredients.However, as he was about to take out the pork prepared by the system, he suddenly paused for a moment. An idea could not help but surface within his mind.\u201cSystem, what if I were to replace this pork with the meat of the Wandering Dragon Cow\u2026 is it feasible?\u201d Bu Fang asked.\u201cYes. However, since an ingredient would be replaced, the price of the dish will change,\u201d the system seriously replied.\u201cHmm? How will it change?\u201d Bu Fang asked in curiosity.The system\u2019s solemn voice resounded within his mind once more. \u201cThe original filling of the Rice Noodle Roll uses pork from a third grade spirit beast. After the host replaces the ingredient with the seventh grade Wandering Dragon Cow, the price of the Rice Noodle Roll will be increased from ten crystals to sixty crystals per serving.\u201dIncreased from ten crystals to sixty crystals\u2026 Bu Fang blinked his eyes. He could not help but exclaim in his mind, \u201cAs expected of a seventh grade ingredient, it definitely doesn\u2019t disappoint. However, there\u2019s probably no one who would chose to eat such an expensive serving of Rice Noodle Roll.\u201d\u201cSystem, could you treat the Rice Noodle Roll with the meat of the Wandering Dragon Cow as filling as the improved version of the Rice Noodle Roll?\u201d\u201cOf course,\u201d the system replied. This was actually the same as the Egg-Fried Rice and Improved Egg-Fried Rice.Bu Fang nodded. Green smoke emerged around his wrist and the Dragon Bone Kitchen Knife appeared in his hand. He started off with the filling needed for the dish. He first cooked the third grade spirit pork in preparation for making the normal Rice Noodle Roll. After he finished preparing the filling, he took out a small piece of the Wandering Dragon Cow\u2019s meat. With the gigantic size of the Wandering Dragon Cow, using such a small piece was not a big deal.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWith the two types of filling readied, the rice milk was done as well.As Bu Fang took the tray out, clouds of white steam rose into the air. The steam was mixed with the rich, mesmerizing aroma of rice, causing him to deeply inhale.He separated the steamed gelatinous sheet from the tray. The sheet was crystal clear like jade, smooth as a mirror, and pleasing to the eyes.The Dragon Bone Kitchen Knife in Bu Fang\u2019s hands performed a few spins and the sheet was equally sliced into rectangular-shaped pieces.Bu Fang first placed the filling made from third grade spirit pork, shrimps, and dried radish granules onto one of the pieces, and then carefully wrapped it up. A \u201cwhite as snow, thin as paper, shiny, fragrant, smooth, and delicious\u201d Rice Noodle Roll was completed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

At least, Bu Fang was already unable to hold himself back any longer.When eating Rice Noodle Roll, a special sauce should naturally be used. Just the thought of eating the smooth and tasty Rice Noodle Roll dipped with the savory sour sauce was enough to excite anyone.After he took a bite of the Rice Noodle Roll, the oil immediately seeped out from the meat filling. The accumulated fragrance burst out at that moment and instantly rushed into Bu Fang\u2019s face, causing him to involuntarily lapse into an euphoric state. The wrapping of the Rice Noodle Roll was gratifyingly smooth and its texture was extremely good. It slightly bounced around in his mouth and produced a springy feeling when he bit down.As expected, the products provided by the system were definitely the finest. The taste of the Rice Noodle Roll was indeed pretty good and was certainly worthy of its pricing of ten crystals. Bu Fang nodded as he continued to gobble down the Rice Noodle Roll.\u201cOh my! Owner Bu, you\u2019re finally opened! I\u2019ve missed you so much for the past two days!\u201dWhile Bu Fang was eating the Rice Noodle Roll, a boorish voice came from outside the store. Fatty Jin and his buddies had arrived in a majestic manner and they immediately spotted Bu Fang as they stepped into the store.Fatty Jin\u2019s eyes immediately lit up and seemed rather impatient as he inhaled the fragrance wafting within the store.\u201cOwner Bu, have you added another new dish?\u201d Fatty Jin asked.\u201cOh\u2026 That\u2019s right,\u201d Bu Fang mumbled as he glanced at Fatty Jin with his mouth stuffed with the Rice Noodle Roll.Fatty Jin swallowed his saliva and a series of growls involuntarily sounded out from his stomach as he watched Bu Fang finish off the last piece of Rice Noodle Roll. He turned his head and looked at the menu on the wall.\u201cThe new dish is\u2026 Rice Noodle Roll, right? Eh? There\u2019s an improved version like the Egg-Fried Rice?\u201d Fatty Jin exclaimed. When he took another look at the price, he saw that the ordinary Rice Noodle Roll was ten crystals per serving while the improved version of the Rice Noodle Roll was\u2026 Good heavens! Sixty crystals per serving?!\u201cOwner Bu\u2026 The difference in the prices is ridiculous!\u201d Fatty Jin said as he turned his head and looked toward Bu Fang, who was tidying up after finishing the food.\u201cOnce you have a taste, you\u2019ll understand the reason for the pricing,\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly replied before he went back into the kitchen. He placed the plate into the automatic dishwasher and returned to the dining area.Fatty Jin was actually feeling rather conflicted. Although he was rich, spending a few hundred crystals per day was somewhat unbearable even if his family owned a crystal mine.\u201cI\u2019ll have a serving of the ordinary Rice Noodle Roll first, as well as a serving of Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs and Red Braised Meat each. Oh, I\u2019ll have the Improved Egg-Fried Rice as well! After eating Owner Bu\u2019s Egg-Fried Rice, my cultivating speed has become much faster,\u201d Fatty Jin said with a chuckle.\u201cAlright, wait a moment,\u201d Bu Fang said with a nod. After he noted the orders of the others, he turned around and went back into the kitchen.Now that Bu Fang obtained the Golden Dragon Bone Kitchen Knife, his cutting technique had improved quite a bit. His speed when handling the ingredients was also much faster than before. After a short while, he finished dealing with the ingredients of the dishes and started cooking.A rich fragrance once again drifted out from the kitchen and into the dining area of the store, causing Fatty Jin and his buddies to involuntarily lapse into an euphoric state.\u201cThe dishes cooked by Owner Bu still smell the best. Smelling the aroma alone is enough to make one feel a sense of satisfaction.\u201d Fatty Jin hummed in euphoria.After a while, Bu Fang walked out of the kitchen while carrying a dish. The first dish he served to Fatty Jin was the Rice Noodle Roll, which was also the dish that Fatty Jin wanted to eat the most. Since it was a new dish, he wanted to try it out.\u201cHere\u2019s your Rice Noodle Roll, please enjoy your meal,\u201d Bu Fang said as he placed the plate of Rice Noodle Roll as well as a condiment bowl filled with sauce in front of Fatty Jin.When Fatty Jin saw the crystal-clear Rice Noodle Roll that looked like a piece of artwork, he could not help but lick his lips. He immediately picked up the Rice Noodle Roll, dipped it in the sauce and impatiently took a bite.As he bit into the springy wrapper that contained the aromatic spirit pork, the oil that overflowed into Fatty Jin\u2019s mouth caused his entire body to tremble in happiness and his eyes to instantly light up.\u201cDelicious! Owner Bu\u2019s dishes are indeed all excellent!\u201d Fatty Jin licked his lips clean before he continued eating the Rice Noodle Roll. However, with his food intake, the entire serving of Rice Noodle Roll only lasted three bites.As Fatty Jin sucked on his fingers, the flesh on his face was almost scrunched together. With such a small serving, he was still not satisfied.However, Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store only allowed dishes to be ordered once\u2026\u201cOwner Bu, give me a serving of the Improved Rice Noodle Roll!\u201d Unable to resist the temptation any longer, Fatty clenched his teeth and ordered the Improved Rice Noodle Roll, which was six times costlier than the normal version.Bu Fang, who was in the kitchen, was surprised for a moment. Then, the corners of his mouth widened into a smile as he nodded.Only after Bu Fang served Fatty Jin\u2019s remaining orders as well as the other\u2019s orders, did he finally start cooking Fatty Jin\u2019s Improved Rice Noodle Roll.There was basically no difference in the steps for the improved version of the Rice Noodle Roll. The main difference was in the filling. The ingredient used was the meat of the seventh grade Wandering Dragon Cow that Bu Fang personally acquired.Bu Fang sliced off a small piece of the Wandering Dragon Cow\u2019s meat. It was extremely fresh and tender and the marbling on its surface seemed to be glistening with vibrant colors. A dense amount of spirit energy was packed within the meat.Bu Fang used the Dragon Bone Kitchen Knife to turn the piece of beef into mincemeat. Since the Dragon Bone Kitchen Knife had the ability to preserve the spirit energy within the ingredients, the spirit energy within the Wandering Dragon Cow\u2019s meat was perfectly retained.After the cooking finished, the aroma of the meat was like a bomb had exploded within the kitchen. Even the obese men in the dining area were attracted by the smell. They were swallowing their salivas as they looked toward Bu Fang\u2019s direction.\u201cWhat kind of meat is this\u2026 What a strong fragrance! I\u2019ve never smelled any meat as aromatic as this before!\u201d This was what the obese men were thinking. Their expectations were high for the next dish Bu Fang was about to bring out.Soon, a slim and tall figure walked out of the kitchen. His slender fingers were grasping a porcelain plate and a crystal-clear Rice Noodle Roll was placed in the middle\u2026Everyone\u2019s eyes that were originally filled with expectation immediately revealed a trace of disappointment. So, it was still a Rice Noodle Roll\u2026On the other hand, Fatty Jin did not care. He was the one who was going to eat it after all. Thus, he cheerfully waited for the Improved Rice Noodle Roll.\u201cYou fools! This is the Improved Rice Noodle Roll, which costs sixty crystals per serving! How could you judge its quality from the appearance? You need to focus on the inner beauty!\u201d The pudgy flesh on Fatty Jin\u2019s face continuously trembled.\u201cImproved Rice Noodle Roll, please enjoy your meal,\u201d Bu Fang simply said.Fatty Jin glanced at Bu Fang before he picked up the Rice Noodle Roll and dipped it with a little bit of sauce. His hand was trembling as he sent it into his mouth.This mouthful\u2026 was exactly twenty crystals!Fatty Jin felt as if he was not biting a Rice Noodle Roll\u2026 but an expensive crystal essence!So, he acted very carefully. After taking a bite, he even pursed his lips so that not even a single piece of minced meat was wasted.As the Rice Noodle Roll entered his mouth, Fatty Jin immediately felt the difference. His eyes were originally very small. However, as everyone watched, his tiny eyes actually widened to the max within a second.His nostrils widened and two streams of hot air gushed out! Within that hot air, dense amount of spirit energy was present!Gulp!After chewing for a while, Fatty Jin swallowed the piece of Rice Noodle Roll in his mouth. He sighed in relief as if he had just experienced a roller coaster ride.\u201cHow\u2019s the taste?\u201d Bu Fang asked in curiosity. Even he had not tasted the Improved Rice Noodle Roll yet. However, Bu Fang was very confident that the taste of the Wandering Dragon Cow\u2019s meat would be good.Fatty Jin\u2019s lips were trembling as spirit energy continued to gush out from his nostrils. He looked at Bu Fang and gave two thumbs up.\u201cIt\u2019s unparalleled! It\u2019s extremely delicious!\u201d Fatty Jin grinned as he said, \u201cThis dense amount of spirit energy\u2026 made the true energy within my body instantly reach the bottleneck! My confidence in advancing to the next level has become even higher!\u201dAfter Fatty Jin finished praising the dish, he did not say anything further. He finished off the rest of the Rice Noodle Roll and hurriedly paid the bill before leaving with his buddies.He wanted to go home and advance to the next level.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBu Fang breathed a sigh of relief in his mind as well. \u201cLooks like the reaction isn\u2019t bad for the ingredient I personally acquired\u2026\u201dAfter cleaning up the tableware, the interior of the store became deserted for a moment.Bu Fang pulled a chair toward the entrance and curled up on it. As he stared at the empty alleyway\u2014which was already repaired by the crown prince\u2019s men\u2014a question surfaced in his mind.\u201cUsually, shouldn\u2019t that girl have already arrived by now? Why isn\u2019t she here yet? Did she forget that the store is opened today?\u201dBu Fang thought as he cozily yawned.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Most of the Ouyang family members were present within the hall.Ouyang Zongheng was solemn as a statue as he sat below his father. The mood within the hall was extremely serious.Xiaoyi was sulking with a pout on her face and her large eyes were filled with dissatisfaction. She glanced at the elderly Ouyang sitting above the great hall and bitterly snorted as she turned her head away.\u201cYou rascals, watch Xiaoyi properly. She\u2019s absolutely not allowed to take even half a step outside of the manor today.\u201d The elderly Ouyang\u2019s head ached whenever he saw Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s behavior, but he still pulled a long face as he instructed the three barbarians of Ouyang.The three barbarians of Ouyang nodded. Their eyes were sternly fixated on Ouyang Xiaoyi. However, when they were glared at by the sullen Ouyang Xiaoyi, the three brothers immediately looked away in guilt.\u201cGrandpa! Why am I not allowed to go out! The store still needs my help!\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi indignantly asked the elderly Ouyang.The elderly Ouyang scowled at her. \u201cXiaoyi, grandpa is only thinking for your sake. For the past few days, the situation within the imperial city has become grim. The crown prince and the second prince has been openly roping in the imperial court\u2019s officials. They\u2019re willing to do anything in order to pull people to their side! We\u2019re afraid for your safety!\u201d\u201cEven if that\u2019s the case\u2026 You still can\u2019t stop me from helping out at the store!\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi was still unhappy as she pouted her mouth while puffing up her cheeks and said.\u201cHelp\u2026 What sort of help can you provide! You\u2019re the daughter of a general! How could you always run around in public and even work as a waitress in a restaurant! What a disgrace!\u201d The elderly Ouyang was exasperated by the stubborn Xiaoyi. His beard was twitching with anger.When Ouyang Xiaoyi heard his words, she suddenly held her arms across her chest. She coldly glanced at the elderly Ouyang and softly laughed. \u201cGrandpa, that\u2019s not what you were saying yesterday! When I advanced to fourth grade Battle-Spirit, you were definitely overjoyed! You were even glad to let me be a waitress everyday!\u201dThe elderly Ouyang\u2019s body stiffened as a hint of embarrassment appeared on his face. However, a grin soon appeared on his face as he shamelessly said, \u201cIf I say you can\u2019t go, then you can\u2019t go! Today, you still have to obediently stay within the manor!\u201d\u201cHmph! Smelly grandpa! I am going to ignore you from now on!\u201dOuyang Xiaoyi was furious! She snorted toward the elderly Ouyang and left the great hall in a huff with her head held high.\u201cWhat are you three rascals doing! Go and watch over that girl!\u201d The elderly Ouyang angrily shouted at the three barbarians of Ouyang, who were busy watching the show.Below the elderly Ouyang, Ouyang Zongheng was wiping away his cold sweat as he thought, \u201cFather\u2026 What kind of example are you setting for the youngsters\u2026\u201dThe elderly Ouyang calmed down after the three barbarians of Ouyang left in low spirits. He turned his head toward Ouyang Zongheng and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the situation on His Majesty\u2019s side?\u201dOuyang Zongheng\u2019s expression immediately turned cold as he solemnly replied, \u201cHis Majesty\u2019s condition is not optimistic.\u201dThe elderly Ouyang suddenly sighed. The emperor had spent his youth leading campaigns against the sects and fought with many experts. His wounds accumulated and left hidden ailments throughout his body. Now that he reached old age, even the mighty Emperor Changfeng was unable to withstand these hidden ailments that suddenly flared up.Ouyang Zongheng helplessly sighed as well. The situation within the imperial city was already somewhat grim. If the emperor passed away, the entire imperial city would instantly descend into chaos. This was also the reason the elderly Ouyang prohibited Ouyang Xiaoyi from leaving the manor.For a while, the great hall became quiet and no one said a word.After a long time, a lone figure rapidly approached the great hall. He swiftly entered the great hall and knelt before the elderly Ouyang with a sealed envelope held in his hand.The elderly Ouyang\u2019s eyelids twitched as he opened the envelope and rapidly scanned its contents.When he finished reading, his complexion was extremely dreadful and his beard was trembling.Ouyang Zongheng swallowed his saliva, and asked, \u201cFather\u2026 What\u2019s the situation?\u201dWith a burst of true energy emitted from his hand, the letter was immediately turned into ashes. The elderly Ouyang\u2019s eyes contained a trace of melancholy and sorrow.\u201cHis Majesty\u2026 passed away.\u201dAs the elderly Ouyang said those words, he seemed to have aged ten years within an instant.\u2026On the main road of the imperial city, a petite figure was skipping while heading toward Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store.\u201cHmph! Stupid grandpa, you actually let my three foolish brothers watch over me. With how thickheaded they are, how could they watch over the resourceful and intelligent Xiaoyi!\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s eyes were curved into crescents. When she thought about her grandpa\u2019s fuming expression when he realized she ran away, she could not help but exult in her mind.\u201cEh? It\u2019s snowing.\u201dOuyang Xiaoyi was walking along when she suddenly exclaimed and raised her head in puzzlement. A burst of winter wind blew across the grey skies and then snowflakes as white as goose feathers silently descended.Xiaoyi stretched out her fair hand and a snowflake fell onto her palm. It silently melted and turned into ice-cold, bone-chilling water. It was like the sky was weeping.\u201cHow beautiful,\u201d Xiaoyi expelled a white cloud of breath as she softly muttered. She flung off the water on her palm and continued moving forward.The arrival of the imperial city\u2019s first snow was that sudden. The pedestrians on the main road all stopped to admire the snow for a while before they hurriedly resumed walking.Behind Ouyang Xiaoyi, several figures suddenly started to follow her. Within an instant, they sped up and completely surrounded her.Xiaoyi\u2019s large eyes suddenly widened as true energy immediately burst forth from her body in order to escape their encirclement.However, the cultivation level of the attackers were high. They were actually all fifth grade Battle-Kings. Ouyang Xiaoyi was captured before she could make any attempts to escape.\u201cLet go of me! My father is General Ouyang and my grandfather is a doyen of the current dynasty! If you kidnap me\u2026 you\u2019ll be beaten up!\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi was infuriated! There was actually someone who was brazen enough to kidnap a general\u2019s daughter within the imperial city!Those Battle-King experts glanced at Ouyang Xiaoyi. They could not even be bothered to give a reply as they immediately stuffed a rag into her mouth and carried her away.\u201cGo back and report to the young master that the mission is completed.\u201dOne of the figures nodded, and then, he instantly separated from the group as the tip of his toes tapped the ground.\u2026Bu Fang was curled up on his chair. As he watched the heavy snow slowly descending from the gray skies, he subconsciously curled up his body even more.It was snowing and the weather became colder as well.There were very few customers on that day, to the point where Bu Fang was not used to it. Basically, those regular customers did not appear.\u201cIs it because it\u2019s snowing?\u201d Bu Fang softly muttered while he remained curled up on the chair.Suddenly, the sound of messy footsteps came from within the alleyway as three bear-like, boorish figures appeared in front of the store.\u201cEh? Isn\u2019t this the really invincible Ouyang brothers?\u201d Bu Fang thought. He was slightly surprised as he puzzledly looked at the anxious Ouyang brothers that appeared in front of his store.\u201cOwner Bu\u2026 Is that girl, Xiaoyi, here?\u201d Ouyang Zhen immediately asked while breathing heavily.\u201cThat girl actually deceived us and secretly snuck out! What happened to the basic trust between siblings!\u201d Ouyang Di said.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBu Fang expressionlessly looked at the three brothers and simply said, \u201cOuyang Xiaoyi didn\u2019t come here today.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s not here?! How could that\u2026 She\u2026\u201d Ouyang Wu glared at Bu Fang. Then, he seemed to have thought of something. The expressions of the three brothers suddenly changed as they looked at each other and said, \u201cOh no!\u201dXiaoyi secretly snuck out in order to help out at the store. However, she was not inside the store\u2026 There was only one possibility.\u201cMotherfucker, these bunch of despicable scumbags dare to kidnap my sister\u2026\u201d Ouyang Zhen angrily shouted. The three brothers immediately turned after and left in a rage, leaving a bewildered Bu Fang behind.As Bu Fang expressionlessly watched the three of them leaving, the corners of his mouth widened into a bemused smile. \u201cThese three brothers\u2026 must have turned stupid.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He raised his head and looked toward the direction of the imperial palace\u2019s Great Hall. His eyes were filled with sorrow and indescribable grief.\u201cFather, what happened?\u201d Xiao Yanyu worriedly asked with a frown as she looked at her father\u2019s sorrowful appearance.Xiao Xiaolong puzzledly looked at his powerful father as well. Since earlier on in the morning, Xiao Meng forbade them from leaving the manor. The two siblings who were planning to head to Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store to enjoy delicious food were extremely bewildered.Xiao Yanyu had an astute mind and she was more perceptive than the carefree Ouyang Xiaoyi. She could guess that the reason their father forbade them from leaving the Xiao manor was probably for their own safety.If they needed protection even while they were inside the imperial city, it could only mean one thing. The imperial city was no longer safe, or\u2026 it was no longer safe for those with important statuses like the children of court officials.\u201cHas the imperial city descended into chaos?\u201d Xiao Yanyu\u2019s voice that was like the singing of birds rang out as she asked Xiao Meng.Xiao Meng glanced at Xiao Yanyu. The muscles on his face slightly trembled before he slowly opened his mouth.\u201cHis Majesty\u2026 passed away.\u201dWhen Xiao Yanyu and Xiao Xiaolong heard those words, their bodies shuddered and then their eyes suddenly widened\u2026The Xiao family was not the only one who received the news. The various rich and influential families living within the imperial city were informed as well. The news of the emperor\u2019s death was like a tsunami that instantly engulfed the imperial city.The ruler of a generation, Emperor Changfeng\u2026 had passed away.This was like a tumultuous earthquake for the entire Light Wind Empire.The situation within the imperial city was already quite uncertain. With the death of the emperor, the city immediately became turbulent. The fight over the throne between the crown prince and the second prince was also completely moved into the open.This could be seen from the fact that all of the rich and influential were making their children obediently stay within their manors.Once the fight over the throne began, the princes would need to rope in helpers. They needed the support of the court officials and they had to win this support on their own. In order to gain the allegiance of the court officials, they would make use of unscrupulous methods like blackmail, kidnapping\u2026 They would use any method available to achieve their goal.On this day, the news of Emperor Changfeng\u2019s passing spread. The crown prince, Ji Chengan, as well as King Yu hurriedly entered the imperial palace and headed for the Great Hall.After approximately an hour or so, the crown prince and King Yu left the imperial palace. After preparing horses and carriages, they begun visiting the manors of each court official in order to enlist their support.The fight between the crown prince and King Yu had finally turned into a showdown.\u2026Zhao manor, the official residence of the Minister of the Left, Zhao Musheng.As the Light Wind Empire\u2019s Minister of the Left, Zhao Musheng\u2019s position was so great that even the princes had to treat him courteously. It was to the point where his rank within the Light Wind Empire could be said to be second only to its guardian, Xiao Meng.Zhao Musheng\u2019s was not considered old. He looked rather healthy from his overall appearance. However, his hair color that alternated between black and white gave him the feeling of vicissitude.He was sitting in a wooden armchair with his eyes slightly narrowed and slapping his belly with one hand.Suddenly, the sound of footsteps came from beyond the door and a figure stepped into the room..\u201cFather! Your child has returned,\u201d Zhao Ruge stepped into the room in a brocade robe and respectfully greeted Zhao Musheng, who was seated in the armchair.\u201cHas the matter been settled?\u201d Zhao Musheng narrowed his eyes and simply asked.\u201cThe matter was completed without a hitch. However\u2026 Why did father send someone to abduct Ouyang Xiaoyi? Are you not afraid of angering that madman, Ouyang Qi?\u201d Zhao Ruge looked at Zhao Musheng in puzzlement. He could not understand why they participated in this messy situation under this sort of circumstances.\u201cJi Changfeng is dead. Now that he\u2019s dead, the pot of soup called the imperial city is finally going to boil. In order to make this pot of soup even tastier, we\u2019ll need to add some condiments\u2026\u201d Zhao Musheng opened his eyes. His eyes were profoundly harmonious and seemed to possess a calming aura.Zhao Ruge\u2019s reverence toward his father became even stronger.\u201cLeave now, and make sure that girl isn\u2019t mistreated. We only brought her here to bring things to a head. If she gets hurt, Ouyang Qi will really try to kill us. That old fogey really cherishes this granddaughter of his,\u201d Zhao Musheng said with a chuckle.\u201cWe\u2019ll have him cause trouble with the crown prince and King Yu first. Let him stir up this pot of soup\u2026\u201dZhao Ruge was startled for a moment and then seemed to have understood something. A hint of a smile tugged at the corners of his mouth as he nodded and left.As Zhao Musheng watched Zhao Ruge\u2019s disappearing figure, he chuckled once more.After Zhao Ruge left the room Zhao Musheng was in, he walked for a while inside of the Zhao manor and soon arrived before a room guarded by two Battle-Kings.\u201cWatch after that girl properly. She\u2019s very clever. Don\u2019t give her a chance to escape,\u201d Zhao Ruge solemnly said.The two Battle-Kings gravely nodded.As Zhao Ruge gazed at the quiet room, the corners of his mouth widened into a smile. \u201cI am really curious. If Owner Bu found out that this girl was kidnapped\u2026 What would he do? Would he immediately rush over while bringing along that iron lump? That would be interesting.\u201d\u2026Within the crown prince\u2019s palace, the crown prince had a forced smile plastered on his face as he looked at the menacing elderly Ouyang. This doyen level figure was not someone he could afford to anger.\u201cElder, I can vouch with my life that I\u2019ve never touched a single hair on Ouyang Xiaoyi!\u201d Ji Chengan\u2019s expression was solemn as he took an oath-taking pose while facing the elderly Ouyang.\u201cMotherfucker! Who else could it be other than you? If my precious Xiaoyi is missing even a single strand of hair, I am going to fucking demolish this crown prince palace of yours!\u201d The elderly Ouyang\u2019s temper was not good. He was cursing and swearing while pointing at the crown prince\u2019s nose. He was scolding the crown prince to the point where the crown prince almost lost his composure.However, the crown prince had no other choice. He could only maintain a forced smile as he watched the elderly Ouyang leave with a strut.Similarly, after the elderly Ouyang left the crown prince\u2019s palace, he immediately headed toward King Yu\u2019s manor. He chewed out King Yu as well, but he still could not obtain any information on Ouyang Xiaoyi.However, after the two princes were scolded by the elderly Ouyang, they kept in check their overt actions and their confrontations became less brazen.After returning to the Ouyang manor, the elderly Ouyang had already lost the dominance he had when scolding the crown prince and King Yu. His expression became rather unpleasant.If King Yu and the crown prince were not responsible for abducting Xiaoyi, then who was the culprit?Within the imperial city, who would have the nerve to capture Ouyang Qi\u2019s granddaughter?The elderly Ouyang pondered for a while. Finally, a name surfaced in his mind\u2026 Zhao Musheng?!\u2026For the past three days, the amount of customers that visited Fang Fang Little Store\u2019s became very small. It reached a point where Bu Fang was bored to death everyday. He could not sense the stormy situation within the imperial city. The only thing he could sense was that his customers had decreased in number.Ouyang Xiaoyi did not come to the store during the three days either. Bu Fang found out that the situation within the imperial city was extremely grim from Fatty Jin, who came on time everyday to eat. Every single influential family was carefully choosing a faction to side with.With the passing of the emperor, the crown prince and King Yu began fighting over the throne.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBu Fang was perplexed after hearing all of this information. He was completely clueless about the so-called fight over the throne. After listening for a short while, he walked away in bewilderment. However, the news about the emperor passing away still made him lament.However, he was extremely concerned about the news regarding Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s abduction. After all, the girl was still his waitress, someone who belonged to Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store. Since she was Bu Fang\u2019s employee, he would not allow her to be easily bullied.Bu Fang was curled up on his chair, watching the heavy snow that continuously descended. The pure white snow had already begun covering the entire imperial city with a layer of silver coating, giving the city an exquisite appearance.\u201cOwner Bu, you seem to be free. Looks like I came at the right time.\u201d A familiar voice\u2014that was mild but contained a bit of arrogance\u2014rang out.Zhao Ruge was standing at the entrance of the store, looking at Bu Fang with a smile on his face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was standing at the entrance of the store with a smile on his face as he looked toward Bu Fang, who was curled up on a chair.Bu Fang raised his eyebrows in surprise. He recognized this fellow who tried to tempt him with crystals on two separate occasions but he resolutely turned him down. However, despite their brief encounter, Bu Fang still remembered Zhao Ruge\u2019s appearance.Bu Fang stood up from his chair. He glanced at Zhao Ruge and asked, \u201cWhat are you ordering?\u201dZhao Ruge stepped into the store and shook off the snow that had clung onto him. He expelled a cloud of breath before he sat down on a chair. After taking a glance at the menu, he realized the store had added many new dishes since his last visit.As the delicious dishes cooked by Bu Fang involuntarily surfaced within his mind, his stomach slightly growled in response. Zhao Ruge ordered a serving of Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs and Improved Egg-Fried Rice, as well as a jar of Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine.Bu Fang nodded. He went back into the kitchen and started cooking the dishes. After a while, a rich aroma wafted out from the kitchen. That fragrance was extremely strong, causing Zhao Ruge to sniff the air.After a long while, Bu Fang\u2019s slender figure walked out from the kitchen while carrying a dish in his hand and he placed it in front of Zhao Ruge.Zhao Ruge did not immediately start eating. Even though the rising steam emanating from the dish was continuously arousing his appetite, Zhao Ruge still managed to endure it. His eyes appeared to be smiling as they landed on Bu Fang.\u201cOwner Bu, where\u2019s Xiaoyi? Didn\u2019t she come here today?\u201d Zhao Ruge\u2019s tone contained a trace of mockery.Bu Fang expressionlessly glanced at him, then pulled out a chair and sat down. He sat upright in front of Zhao Ruge. Everything was completed in an unhurried and leisure manner.\u201cShe didn\u2019t come today,\u201d Bu Fang simply replied as his pitch-black pupils locked onto Zhao Ruge\u2019s cheek.Zhao Ruge was extremely calm. Even though Bu Fang was staring right at him, there was not even a slightest change in his expression. After suffering so many losses within the store, this was the first time he felt he was holding the initiative. He could use the attitude of a superior to face Bu Fang.\u201cIs Owner Bu not curious why she didn\u2019t come?\u201d Zhao Ruge asked as the corners of his mouth curled up.Bu Fang did not reply this time around and only watched Zhao Ruge. Zhao Ruge was not flustered either. With a faint smile, he removed the cloth cover of the Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine and poured a cup of wine for himself. The rich aroma of wine immediately spread into the surroundings. As the aroma hovered around the tip of his nose, an euphoric expression was revealed on his face.In the past, he used to believe the number one wine within the Light Wind Empire was the imperial palace\u2019s Bejewelled Nectar Wine. However, ever since he tasted the store\u2019s Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine, he was completely subdued by this fine wine.\u201cOwner Bu, do you want a cup as well?\u201d Zhao Ruge shook the blue and white porcelain wine cup in his hand as he asked Bu Fang out of politeness.\u201cOh, hold on,\u201d Bu Fang softly replied. Then, under the embarrassed gaze of Zhao Ruge, he stood up and headed toward the kitchen. After a while, he returned with a clean porcelain wine cup.\u201cFill it to the brim, don\u2019t be shy,\u201d Bu Fang said.Zhao Ruge was speechless as he looked at Bu Fang. He thought, \u201cDon\u2019t you realize I was only being polite? With our relationship, do you think I would treat you to a drink? This wine costs fifteen crystals per jar, and more importantly, there isn\u2019t much of it in the first place.\u201dUnder Bu Fang\u2019s sincere gaze, Zhao Ruge was unable to refuse his request out of politeness. He could only fill Bu Fang\u2019s wine cup to the brim with a deadpan expression.Bu Fang raised the wine cup to his mouth and took a sip of wine, revealing a trace of contentment in his eyes.With the cold temperature and the snow fluttering about outside of the store, warming up the body with fine wine was such a wonderful pleasure\u2026\u201cOwner Bu, are you really not curious why Xiaoyi did not come?\u201d Zhao Ruge asked once more. He finished the wine within his cup and narrowed his eyes at Bu Fang.Bu Fang glanced at him as he placed the already emptied wine cup on the table and he took the liberty of grabbing the wine jar. After filling up his wine cup to the brim, he simply replied, \u201cWhy do I need to know\u2026\u201dZhao Ruge expressionlessly watched as Bu Fang unceremoniously drank the Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine that he ordered. He suddenly felt a touch of sadness as he regretted opening his mouth.\u201cShe\u2019s your employee! As an employer, shouldn\u2019t you be worried about your employees?\u201d Zhao Ruge asked.\u201cI am very concerned,\u201d Bu Fang replied.\u201cHow is this the appearance of someone who is concerned?\u201d Zhao Ruge was somewhat speechless as he pursed his lips.As Bu Fang finished the cup of wine once more, a touch of faint redness appeared on his fair cheeks. This was a sign that the alcohol was taking effect.However, once a person started drinking the Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine, they would get the feeling of not being able to stop themselves. Therefore, Bu Fang poured another cup for himself\u2026Zhao Ruge\u2019s eyes that were directed at Bu Fang were almost spewing fire\u2026 He thought, \u201cThere isn\u2019t much wine in the jar, yet you\u2019re still pouring even though you\u2019ve already drunk two cups! Do you feel no shame?!\u201dBu Fang placed the wine cup on the table and heavily breathed out before he replied, \u201cI am very concerned, but I am not worried since you won\u2019t do anything to her.\u201dBu Fang indifferently looked at Zhao Ruge and the latter\u2019s pupils constricted in response. He did not think Bu Fang would immediately guess that he was the one who abducted Ouyang Xiaoyi.\u201cYou came here to tell me about this matter for no particular reason, that\u2019s no different than admitting that you\u2019re culprit\u2026 However, I am not worried since you wouldn\u2019t dare to do anything to her. You can\u2019t afford to offend the Ouyang family,\u201d Bu Fang said.\u201cHahaha! Owner Bu has completely seen through me. I was really too reckless. I wonder if Owner Bu has any interest in joining hands with me. Now that the imperial city has descended into chaos, it\u2019s a good chance to choose a side. As long as Owner Bu is willing to join hands with me, I can guarantee that Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store shall become the most famous restaurant within the imperial city and even the entire Light Wind Empire.\u201dZhao Ruge\u2019s eyes suddenly became fervent as he stared at Bu Fang.\u201cCooperation?\u201d Bu Fang expressionlessly looked at Zhao Ruge. \u201cNot interested.\u201d\u201cOwner Bu, don\u2019t be in a hurry to refuse me. My father is the current dynasty\u2019s Minister of the Left. We definitely have the ability to make Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store the number one restaurant within the Light Wind Empire. With your powerful puppet and supreme beast companion, it\u2019ll be easy for us to assist one of the princes into becoming the emperor,\u201d Zhao Ruge said.Bu Fang shook his head after giving Zhao Ruge a single glance. He poured himself another cup of wine and a jar of Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine was finished just like that.After finishing the cup of wine, Bu Fang did not even give a response to Zhao Ruge. He stood up while slightly swaying and slowly walked into the kitchen.His silence meant refusal.The fervent expression on Zhao Ruge\u2019s face gradually disappeared, and then, he began tasting the Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs and Egg-Fried Rice with a composed expression. However, when he picked up the Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine, he discovered the jar was already empty\u2026At that moment, Zhao Ruge really wanted to throw the empty jar at Bu Fang\u2019s head! That fellow was truly outrageous!After he finished his meal, Zhao Ruge threw down some crystals and left in a huff. He only managed to drink a single cup of wine out of an entire jar of Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine that costed him fifteen crystals, and the rest ended up in Bu Fang\u2019s stomach. How infuriating!\u2026Inside of the Zhao manor, Zhao Musheng was slowly walking within the garden while wearing an overcoat with images of cranes sewn on it. However, there was nothing beautiful about the garden that was covered by a layer of snow.A figure glided into the manor, landed in front of Zhao Musheng and respectfully said, \u201cThe secret letter has been delivered into the hands of the crown prince.\u201dZhao Musheng imperceptibly nodded. He raised his hand and a lump of pale yellow true energy that gave a feeling of tranquility and harmony hovered on his palm.\u201cVery good. Has the young Marquis Yang been captured?\u201d Zhao Musheng indifferently asked.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHe has already been caught. We\u2019ve placed him into the same room as Ouyang Xiaoyi,\u201d the figure respectfully replied.Zhao Musheng lightly exhaled a cloud of white breath. A snowflake drifted into his palm and was instantly shattered into pieces by the true energy gathered there.A terrifying force was actually hidden underneath that tranquil and harmonious true energy.\u201cWith both the young marquis and the Ouyang family\u2019s girl on our hands, the crown prince won\u2019t be able to reject our offer\u2026 The emperor of the Light Wind Empire, very good.\u201dZhao Musheng dispersed the true energy gathered within his palm. He slowly stepped on the snow and left the garden, leaving behind meaningful words that lingered in the surroundings.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She recognized the brat as the extremely well-known heir of a Marquis. However, what was he doing there?Yang Chen was the seventh child of the Marquis Who Pacifies the West, Yang Mo. Whenever the Yang family was mentioned, their deeds of sacrificing themselves for their country had to be acknowledged. The head of the Yang family, Yang Mo, had four sons. The first three sons were extremely talented individuals that used to be influential figures within the imperial city. Unfortunately, all three of them died on the battlefield during their participation on military campaigns. In the end, Yang Chen was the only son left in the entire Yang family.Therefore, the Yang family was extremely concerned about Yang Chen. As the first-in-line successor to the Marquis position, there was no room for mistakes.\u201cWhat is a brat like you doing here?\u201d Yang Chen was very arrogant. He had always been putting effort in his cultivation with his elder brothers as his goal. Now, he had already reached the level of a fourth grade Battle-Spirit. This degree of talent and cultivation level was already considered the highest among his peers.When Ouyang Xiaoyi looked at Yang Chen\u2019s immature yet arrogant face, she could not help but roll her eyes and reply with a pout, \u201cDo you really think I want to be here? There isn\u2019t even anything delicious here\u2026 This place is like hell on earth!\u201dYang Chen was unable to understand Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s words. Even though they were being held captive, the people who abducted them was not ill-treating them. They were properly served with three meals each day and the taste of the dishes brought to them was very good. Yang Chen ate his meals with great relish.\u201cIf you\u2019re getting excited over eating this sort of dishes, I can tell that you\u2019re someone who hasn\u2019t seen the world.\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi held her arms across her chest as she disdainfully glanced at the dishes placed on the table as well as Yang Chen, whose lips were covered with oil.\u201cI haven\u2019t seen the world? A little brat like you is the one that hasn\u2019t seen the world! I\u2019ve been to the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant numerous times!\u201d Yang Chen unhappily mumbled while his mouth was filled with food.\u201cImmortal Phoenix Restaurant?\u201d When the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant was mentioned, Ouyang Xiaoyi snorted and rolled her eyes in disdain.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Are you looking down on the Immortal Phoenix Restaurant as well?\u201d Yang Chen\u2019s eyes widened as he looked at Ouyang Xiaoyi.Ouyang Xiaoyi pursed her lips and said, \u201cCompared to the dishes made by the smelly boss, the food from Immortal Phoenix Restaurant is no better than dregs. You haven\u2019t even tasted Owner Bu\u2019s dishes and you still dare to claim that you\u2019ve seen the world\u2026 Let me ask you, have you ever tasted Fish Head Tofu Soup that increases the true energy within your body? Have you ever eaten Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs that sends you into an euphoric state just from smelling the aroma? Have you ever eaten Egg-Fried Rice that sparkles?\u201dOuyang Xiaoyi mentioned a few dishes from Fang Fang\u2019s Little Store in a row. As a waitress, she was naturally familiar enough with the names of the dishes to immediately list them.Yang Chen blankly stared at Ouyang Xiaoyi in an adorable manner. He had never heard of the names of these dishes before\u2026 However, they sounded really impressive. Could a person really increase their cultivation level by eating a meal?\u201cHmph! Impressive, right? I\u2019ve eaten all of these dishes before!\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi loftily said.Yang Chen picked up some food with his chopsticks and shoved it into his mouth. As he chewed the food, he said, \u201cIt sounds pretty good. Where\u2019s the location of the store? When are you bringing me there to have a look?\u201dWhen Ouyang Xiaoyi heard his words, her large eyes immediately did a little turn. Then, a smile appeared on her adorable face as she said, \u201cLet\u2019s go right now. None of these dishes suit my appetite. I haven\u2019t eaten anything for over a day!\u201d\u201cRight now?\u201d Yang Chen was stunned. They were currently held captive, how would they be able to leave?\u201cThat fellow who\u2019s monitoring us is only a fifth grade Battle-King. With our cultivation level, we can instantly deal with him if we take him by surprise. Then, we\u2019ll be able to make our escape!\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi said with sparkling eyes.Yang Chen raised his eyebrows and then suddenly excitedly nodded.Immediately after, Ouyang Xiaoyi fell onto the ground and started throwing a tantrum. Her acting that was instantly performed startled Yang Chen for a moment.When the guard outside heard the commotion, he stepped into the room and immediately saw Ouyang Xiaoyi kicking a fuss onto the ground.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Stop making so much noise!\u201d The guard impatiently knitted his eyebrows together. He was annoyed that the two brats were not behaving.\u201cShe thinks the taste of the food is too terrible. She also said your chef is a pig,\u201d Yang Chen earnestly said.Upon hearing Yang Chen\u2019s words, the guard did not know whether to laugh or cry. After he approached the food on the table and sampled it, he said, \u201cThe taste is pretty good though?\u201dYang Chen approached the guard and said with a nod, \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty good as well\u2026 However, she thinks the chef is a pig, so she doesn\u2019t want to eat the food here and wants to go outside.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d Just then, the guard noticed something was wrong. In the next moment, true energy burst forth from Yang Chen and restricted the guard\u2019s limbs. Even though the guard was a fifth grade Battle-King, he was unable to react after receiving a sneak attack from such a close range.Ouyang Xiaoyi leapt off the ground while brandishing her fists and greeted the guard\u2019s face with a punch.The Ouyang family\u2019s style was kicking their opponents when they were down. Therefore, Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s next few punches all landed on the guard\u2019s face. The guard fell onto the ground and lost consciousness.Then, Ouyang Xiaoyi pulled Yang Chen along as they left the room that imprisoned them at a trot and snuck out of the mansion.\u2026During the bright sunny days in the imperial city, the sunlight shining through the clouds was rather dazzling. As it shone over the people, it felt warm and comfortable.After Bu Fang finished serving the first wave of customers, the store regained its tranquility once more. And so, Bu Fang was curled up on a chair near the entrance like the past few days. There was sunlight on that day and he was feeling drowsy from the warmth felt throughout his body.It was quite comfortable to pass the days like this.\u201cSmelly boss! Save me!\u201d At the entrance of the alleyway, a heart-rending scream rang out. Bu Fang, whose eyes had just closed, opened them and puzzledly looked into the distance.There, two runty figures were running like mad while taking wide strides as a few experts with powerful auras chased after them. The speed of the pursuers was very fast and they were right about to catch up to the two brats.One of the Battle-Kings caught up with them and directly grabbed hold of Ouyang Xiaoyi. He picked her up and said with a sneer, \u201cLet\u2019s see how you\u2019re going to run now!\u201dThey did not expect the two canaries kept within a birdcage would be able to get out! They almost let them escape!\u201cDo you know who I am? I\u2019ll make my grandpa strip you down and hang you up on the walls of the imperial city!\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi was furious. The smelly boss\u2019 store was not far from there, but she was caught at the last moment. The anxious feeling of waiting for help made her want to go crazy.\u201cSmelly boss, save me! Blacky, save me!\u201d Therefore, Ouyang Xiaoyi started screaming for help, hoping that Bu Fang would save her. However, she felt that her chances of escaping might be much higher if Blacky came instead\u2026Blacky, who was lying on the ground, murmured as it opened its eyes. It lazily yawned while sticking its tongue out and exhaled a cloud of white breath.\u201cWho\u2019s calling for your lord dog?\u201d Blacky puzzledly scanned its surroundings and soon found Ouyang Xiaoyi struggling to escape at the entrance of the alleyway.\u201cYou brat, why are you calling your lord dog for no reason? Don\u2019t you know how busy your lord dog is\u2026\u201d Blacky lazily got up and slowly headed for the alleyway\u2019s entrance while striding like a cat.Bu Fang slowly walked out of the store. He stood at the entrance and expressionlessly looked toward the alleyway\u2019s entrance.Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s large eyes immediately lit up when she spotted the big black dog slowly approaching them. She yelled out, \u201cBlacky, save me!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euYang Chen sniffled his nose that was slightly numb from the cold and puzzledly looked at the swarthy big black dog that was rather overweight\u2026The few guards were also looking at Blacky with weird expressions on their faces.Did this girl really think a dog would be able to rescue her from the hands of a few Battle-Kings? Should they call her naive\u2026 or naive?However, in the next moment, these people were all shocked by the big black dog that started speaking like a human.\u201cObey this lord dog\u2019s words, let go of that girl\u2026\u201d Blacky\u2019s lukewarm voice sounded out of nowhere.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His expression was grave and his eyes revealed the myriad of thoughts running through his mind. There were a few sheets of secret letters lying on the table in front of him.\u201cZhao Musheng, that wily old fox\u2026 I knew he was the one behind all of this!\u201d The crown prince\u2019s expression was agitated. He picked up one of the secret letters from the table and became even angrier as he looked at it. The letter was soon crumpled into a ball.\u201cIf only Xushi was still around\u2026\u201d Ji Chengan thought as he let out a long sigh. If Xushi was around, he would probably be able to provide him with a good idea. At the very least, he would not appear as passive.The emperor\u2019s sudden passing caught everyone by surprise. If the news was not accidentally leaked by one of the eunuchs working in the palace, they might still be in the dark.\u201cAbducting both Ouyang Xiaoyi and Yang Chen\u2026 This Zhao Musheng really is brazen. Nevertheless, there\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t work together. If I agreed to his offer, that would be equivalent to gaining the support of both the Ouyang family and the Yang family\u2026 In that case, it wouldn\u2019t be easy for my second brother to overthrow me\u2026 even if he\u2019s colluding with the sects!\u201d The crown prince muttered. Then, he unravelled the crumpled piece of secret letter once more and carefully examined it for a while. He seemed to have made some kind of huge decision in his mind.\u2026Zhao Musheng lightly blew on the cup of tea in his hands. He took a sip of tea before he mildly asked, \u201cWhat did you say? A few Battle-Kings can\u2019t even watch over two Battle-Spirit level brats?\u201dThe complexion of the man in brocade robe, standing before him, suddenly became extremely pale. He hurriedly knelt down on the floor and fearfully said, \u201cMy lord, the fault lies with me. I\u2019ve already sent some of the men to bring them back\u2026 But\u2026\u201d\u201cBut what?\u201d Zhao Musheng indifferently asked as he continued to drink his tea.The man in brocade robe sneaked a peek at Zhao Musheng before he cautiously replied, \u201cThe Ouyang family\u2019s little princess and Yang family\u2019s heir are fleeing toward that mysterious store\u2026\u201d\u201cMysterious store? Hmm? Are you talking about the place that has been the talk of the town recently? The restaurant that even the emperor himself personally visited?\u201d Zhao Musheng\u2019s drinking movement suddenly paused as he puzzledly asked. He had heard some rumors about that little restaurant as well, but he did not know much about it.However, from the data he gathered, he knew that the background of the restaurant was definitely not simple.\u201cA supreme beast and a puppet with the capability of repelling a seventh grade Battle-Saint? This store is really something else\u2026 Have you investigated them yet?\u201d Zhao Musheng asked.\u201cWe did, but we didn\u2019t find out anything,\u201d the man in brocade robe replied. That was the reason he was feeling fearful. If Ouyang Xiaoyi and Yang Chen escaped into that store, they would need to get through that store in order to catch them once again. However, the store\u2026 seemed to be out of the ordinary.\u201cHmph! If you can\u2019t even accomplish something like this, what am I keeping you around for? I am spending tens of thousands of crystals on your intelligence network every year, yet you can\u2019t even find out anything about a little restaurant?\u201d Zhao Musheng coldly sorted and said, while glancing at the man.The man felt cold sweat running down his back.\u201cForget it, perhaps this store really is more mysterious. On this vast continent, there are many unknown powers that we can\u2019t even imagine. It\u2019s not your fault that you can\u2019t find out anything. However\u2026 you must definitely bring the Ouyang family\u2019s girl and the Yang family\u2019s heir back here! If need be, you\u2019ll personally do it. At any rate, I want to see them standing in front of me.\u201dThat man\u2019s expression suddenly became ghastly. \u201cMy lord, but there\u2019s\u2026 a supreme beast watching over that store! Furthermore, even that iron puppet is not something a mere sixth grade Battle-Emperor like me could deal with.\u201d\u201cA supreme beast? Hmph\u2026 Do you really believe the rumors? Do you really think a supreme beast would act as a watchdog for a store? Even the Celestial Arcanum Sect, the most mysterious group within the ten great sects, doesn\u2019t have that capability, let alone some store.\u201dEvidently, Zhao Musheng did not believe a supreme beast would be watching over a store. Perhaps the failure of both Xiao Meng and Eunuch Lian was just a fluke? They might have been accidentally deluded by that dog.Zhao Musheng was very confident of his hypothesis because he had seen a real ninth grade supreme beast before. He knew how terrifying those existences were. How could one of them become a watchdog for a little restaurant\u2026 That was something completely unfounded.Zhao Musheng\u2019s adamant attitude was very upsetting for the man in the brocade robe\u2026 However, there was nothing else he could do. He could only give it a shot. At the moment, the only choice he had was to believe that his master\u2019s conjecture was correct.\u2026\u201cThere\u2019s actually such a wondrous dog in this word?! It\u2019s actually capable of human speech!\u201d A fifth grade Battle-King was blankly staring at Blacky. He felt as if his world view was completely flipped over.Yang Chen was also blankly staring at Blacky. This was his first time meeting Blacky and he did not expect this dog would actually start speaking.\u201cLet go of that girl\u2026 Is that what a dog like you should be saying?\u201d Yang Chen thought while feeling dumbfounded.\u201cHahaha! Is a fat dog like you planning to save a damsel in distress? This is just too\u2026\u201d The Battle-Kings were all laughing and were completely unable to stop.Bu Fang was standing at the entrance of the store. He could hear their completely unstoppable laughter, but his expression was deadpan. A faint trace of pity for them appeared in his eyes.The other Battle-Kings who behaved arrogantly in front of Blacky\u2026 were all dead.While thinking about this, Bu Fang could not help but open his mouth as he suddenly said, \u201cLazy dog, go easy on them. Don\u2019t break the floor again. It was just repaired and repairing the tiles again would be\u2026 troublesome.\u201dWhen Blacky heard Bu Fang\u2019s words, it immediately rolled its eyes and muttered under its breath. It could not be even bothered to reply.The Battle-King that was restraining Ouyang Xiaoyi was frowning as he watched the scene unfold. Alarms were going off in his mind\u2026 A restaurant situated within an alleyway and a dog that was capable of human speech? He could not figure out why everything seemed so familiar.\u201cWhy are we wasting our breath on a dog? This dog is so fat, this is just nice for us to have a dog meat hot pot! Delicious!\u201d However, the other Battle-King was not taking the situation seriously. He was rolling up his sleeves as he walked toward Blacky with a sneer on his face. From his posture, he seemed to be\u2026 trying to catch a dog?Blacky was looking at that Battle-King with sincere eyes as it stretched out an exquisite paw that was trembling.\u201cHehe, you finally understood the situation. Too bad, it\u2019s already too late. There\u2019s no use even if you act cute!\u201d That Battle-King suddenly started laughing.However, in the next moment, when Blacky\u2019s paw lightly touched his body, the Battle-King\u2019s laughter was stifled and he became frozen on the spot.\u201cHmm? What\u2019s going on?\u201d The Battle-King restraining Ouyang Xiaoyi puzzledly asked with a frown.As he finished speaking, he felt a terrifying gust of wind blew past his body\u2014along with a human figure\u2014causing his hair to flutter around.Boom!!A human figure was instantly shot through half of the imperial city and it pierced through countless amount of houses before ending up as a pile of meat paste on the ground.\u201cOh, this way the ground won\u2019t be damaged. Bark,\u201d Blacky mildly said as an imperious aura suddenly burst forth from its eyes. In front of it, that Battle-King was no different from an ant.The remaining Battle-King, who was restraining Xiaoyi, started trembling when he finally realized where he was.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAccording to the rumors, there was a black-hearted store situated within an alleyway inside the imperial city with a supreme beast watching over it\u2026 He originally thought the rumor was just a joke. However, his colleague was just sent flying and turned into meat paste with the touch of a single dog paw\u2026 If anyone dared to claim this dog was not a supreme beast, he would personally confront them!At that moment, the Battle-King was kicking himself inwardly. He never expected the two brats would actually flee toward this store\u2026Suddenly, the Battle-King felt his hands went empty. Ouyang Xiaoyi had stomped on his face and broken free from his restraints. She landed on the ground and quickly made her escape.\u201cI\u2026\u201d The Battle-King\u2019s pupils constricted as he suddenly felt a dreadful feeling before a furry and cute dog paw tapped on his stomach.It was a very light tap\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

During that instant, he seemed to have spotted a pitiful figure within that gust of wind.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Song Tao thought as he looked behind him in confusion. Then, he heard a loud noise. The ground started trembling and a cloud of dust was slowly rising from the debris in the distance.Song Tao suddenly felt a chill coursing through his body.\u201cOh, not bad. Doing it this way simplify things,\u201d Bu Fang said in satisfaction with a nod. At least, the alleyway\u2019s newly repaired quartzite flooring was not broken by Blacky\u2019s paws once more.While Song Tao was still in a daze, two of the Battle-Kings were scrambling to escape. When they saw Song Tao, they fearfully shouted, \u201cSi\u2026 Sir! Hurry up and run! That dog\u2026 is too terrifying!\u201dSong Tao\u2019s heart sank. As he had expected\u2026 the mission failed. Not even four Battle-Kings were able to bring back Ouyang Xiaoyi and Yang Chen. How was he going to make a report when he got back?However, Song Tao was unwilling to just leave like that. Therefore, he headed into the alleyway to face that terrifying big black dog who sent a Battle-King flying with a flick of its claw.Blacky indifferently gave Song Tao a glance and rolled its eyes when it saw the latter\u2019s wary appearance. It lazily returned to the front of the store while striding like a cat and went back to sleep.Meanwhile, Ouyang Xiaoyi was pulling Yang Chen into the store, while completely ignoring Song Tao who was standing at the alleyway\u2019s entrance. A gust of cold wind blew past, bringing a burst of chilliness.\u201cBrat, this is the place I mentioned, that\u2026 smelly boss\u2019 store. Even though the owner himself is so-so, the taste of his dishes are really good,\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi said after she pulled Yang Chen into the store.As Yang Chen assessed the store\u2019s environment, a look of disdain suddenly surfaced on his juvenile face. He held his arms across his chest as he said, \u201cYou were talking about this cramped little place? The furnishing is ordinary, the customers are ordinary as well\u2026 How could there be anything decent here? Were you lying to me?\u201dYang Chen actually distrusted her sincere words? Ouyang Xiaoyi immediately became anxious. She gave Yang Chen a wide-eyed stare as she said, \u201cWhy would I lie to you? If I were really lying, then I\u2019ll get smelly boss to apologize to you!\u201dNext to them, Bu Fang was startled for a moment. A trace of confusion flashed across his face as he thought, \u201cWhy would I have to apologize if you\u2019re the one lying? Where\u2019s the logic in that?\u201d\u201cHmph! Do you think I care about his apology?\u201d Yang Chen glanced at Bu Fang and laughed in disdain. Bu Fang was only a mere chef in his eyes. What could a chef do, ascend into the skies?\u201cYou ignorant fellow, you\u2019ll soon understand how foolish your words are!\u201d Ouyang Xiaoyi sneered as she turned to Bu Fang and said, \u201cSmelly boss, give me a serving of Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs! We\u2019ll let him experience a real craving!\u201dYang Chen pursed his lips. As his gaze swept toward the menu hung on the wall, his pupils constricted to nearly the size of a black sesame seed.\u201cAren\u2019t these prices marked wrongly? Why are crystals used as the standard? Do you really think your dishes are panaceas?!\u201d After seeing the prices on the menu, Yang Chen could not help but complain.Bu Fang was almost automatically immune to his complaints and could not even be bothered to reply. So what if Yang Chen was complaining? Bu Fang was not going to lose any flesh from his complaints. If Yang Chen was going to taste his dishes, he would still have to order them\u2026 He would still have to submit to the price of the dishes.With his skills, he was that confident.Song Tao was unwilling to give up, so he stepped into the store as well. With a single glance, he caught sight of Yang Chen, who was expressing his disdain. Song Tao\u2019s eyes lit up as he thought, \u201cThe Yang family\u2019s heir, this is an important person. I must definitely bring him back with me.\u201d\u201cWhat are you having, look at the menu yourself.\u201d Before Song Tao could say anything, a cold voice rang out next to him.Bu Fang was expressionlessly looking at Song Tao while pointing toward the menu behind his back.Song Tao was startled for a moment. When he glanced at the menu, his nostrils slightly widened and steam gushed out\u2026 He thought, \u201cDamn, this is a daylight robbery! The black-hearted store truly deserves its reputation!\u201dHowever, he was unwilling to give up like that. The fair and tender Ouyang loli was right there. The tsundere shota, Yang Chen, was standing in front of him as well. If Song Tao were to leave like this, it was not any different from giving up on eating two pieces of overwhelmingly fragrant Red Braised Meat when you were about to starve to death\u2026\u201cOwner! Give me a serving of\u2026 Egg-Fried Rice!\u201d Song Tao endured the pain in his heart as he ordered the Egg-Fried Rice, that cost one crystal per serving. His heart seemed to be bleeding. Earning crystals was not so easy nowadays!When Ouyang Xiaoyi heard what Song Tao ordered, she immediately gave him a disdainful glance. She scornfully snorted and said, \u201cSmelly boss, hurry up and cook my Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs that costs fifty crystals per serving!\u201dAs the princess of the Ouyang family, she lacked anything but crystals!\u201cWhat about you? What are you ordering?\u201d Bu Fang asked as he looked at Yang Chen.\u201cSince they\u2019ve already ordered, then get me a serving of\u2026 Ice Heart Jade Urn Wine,\u201d Yang Chen said with his chin held high.The corners of Bu Fang\u2019s mouth widened as he glanced at Yang Chen and said, \u201cChildren are not allowed to drink alcohol.\u201dYang Chen\u2019s body suddenly stiffened for a moment. His little eyes widened as he looked straight at Bu Fang, while the latter expressionlessly looked back at him. After a while, Yang Chen looked away in defeat\u2026 How exasperating!\u201cForget it, give me a serving of Red Braised Meat!\u201d\u201cAlright, wait a moment.\u201d Bu Fang nodded before turning around and heading into the kitchen.Song Tao carefully found a seat and sat down. His eyes were constantly assessing his surroundings. At the entrance to the kitchen, he saw a mechanical figure\u2026 Was that the black-hearted store\u2019s puppet that could face a seventh grade Battle-Saint head-on?When Whitey\u2019s round head suddenly turned and its mechanical red eyes met Song Tao\u2019s eyes, the latter hurriedly turned his gaze away in fear.\u201cHmph! If the taste of the dishes here is terrible\u2026 I\u2019ll definitely look down on this place! How dare you charge such a high price for food that tastes terrible! I will also publicize to the entire imperial city and let everyone know that this place is a sham!\u201d Yang Chen declared in a tsundere-like manner.Ouyang Xiaoyi rolled her eyes. She was too lazy to care about this tsundere shota. At that moment, she just wanted to eat the smelly boss\u2019 dishes. After not eating for a day, she was feeling extremely hungry\u2026 She even lost weight!Yang Chen was still rambling on by himself. However, the rich fragrance of meat soon wafted out from the kitchen.The smell of meat slowly drifted out\u2014like a piece of silk caressing their faces\u2014giving them a false sense of reality. Ouyang Xiaoyi\u2019s exquisite nose was upturned as she furiously breathed in this meaty aroma. Her face was filled with happiness.It was this aroma! This was the smelly boss\u2019 aroma!After a while, a figure walked out from the darkness of the kitchen. Bu Fang\u2019s slender fingers were holding a porcelain plate containing the amber-colored Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs, which was overflowing with vibrant colors and light. Piping hot steam, accompanied with a rich fragrance, was rising from the plate.Ouyang Xiaoyi was already quite eager to start eating. Her large eyes were staring straight at Bu Fang.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHere\u2019s your Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs, take your time,\u201d Bu Fang said as he placed the plate in front of Ouyang Xiaoyi and patted her head.Then, he returned into the kitchen and began cooking the other dishes.The Sweet \u2018n\u2019 Sour Ribs was captivatingly fragrant. The smell alone was causing Yang Chen, who had been complaining all day, to enter into a daze. His eyes were staring straight at the amber-colored pieces of meat.Even Song Tao could not help but be attracted by the aroma. However, he was more concerned about how he was going to snatch the two brats out of the store\u2026\u201cOh\u2026 without having to get into a fight,\u201d Song Tao timidly thought as he glanced at Whitey and the latter\u2019s mechanical eyes turned toward him once more.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
